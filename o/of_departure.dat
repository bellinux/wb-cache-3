5|$|In the Land <b>of</b> <b>Departure,</b> Terra and Aqua take an exam {{to achieve}} the Mark of Mastery. Master Xehanort manipulates the test so only Aqua passes and Terra fails, {{lessening}} Terra's control of the darkness in his heart. Shortly after the test, Xehanort disappears and a horde of mysterious creatures called the Unversed begin to appear throughout the worlds {{in pursuit of the}} Princesses of Heart. Learning about these developments from Yen Sid, Master Eraqus sends Terra and Aqua to destroy the Unversed and find Xehanort throughout the countless worlds. Later, Xehanort's apprentice Vanitas convinces Ventus to follow Terra against Eraqus' wishes, while Eraqus orders Aqua to watch over Terra and bring Ventus back to the Land <b>of</b> <b>Departure.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analysis <b>of</b> the <b>departure</b> process <b>of</b> a discrete-time Geo/G/ 1 queue with randomized vacations. By using probability decomposition techniques and renewal process, {{the expression of}} expected number <b>of</b> <b>departures</b> during time interval (0 +,n+] is derived. The relation among departure process, server state process, and service renewal process is obtained. The relation displays the decomposition characteristic <b>of</b> the <b>departure</b> process. Furthermore, the approximate expansion of the expected number <b>of</b> <b>departures</b> is gained. Since the departure process also often corresponds to an arrival process for a downstream queue in queueing network, {{it is hoped that}} the results obtained in this paper may provide useful information for queueing network...|$|R
5|$|The {{population}} of Halifax/Dartmouth had increased to between 60,000 and 65,000 people by 1917. Convoys carried soldiers, men, animals and {{supplies to the}} European theatre of war. The two main points <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> were in Nova Scotia at Sydney in Cape Breton and Halifax. Hospital ships brought the wounded to the city, and a new military hospital was constructed in the city.|$|E
5|$|Ventus confronts Xehanort, who {{reveals his}} {{intentions}} to fuse hearts between Ventus and Vanitas {{to create an}} all-powerful Keyblade called the χ-blade. Xehanort sends Ventus to the Land <b>of</b> <b>Departure,</b> where Eraqus plans to imprison Ventus to foil Xehanort's plan. Terra arrives to save Ventus and fights with Eraqus. Upon his defeat, Eraqus is vanquished by Xehanort, who covers the Land <b>of</b> <b>Departure</b> in darkness and tells Terra {{to go to a}} world known as the Keyblade Graveyard. Ventus is instructed to do the same by Vanitas, as is Aqua by Yen Sid, who informs her about Eraqus' demise.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} of Ventus' state, Aqua brings {{his body to}} the Land <b>of</b> <b>Departure,</b> which she transforms into Castle Oblivion to ensure Ventus will not be disturbed. Back at Radiant Garden, Aqua senses Xehanort possessing Terra's body. When Terra tries {{to regain control of}} his body, Xehanort impales himself with his own Keyblade, causing him to sink into the realm of darkness. Aqua dives into the realm and rescues Terra, but becomes trapped. Ansem the Wise finds Xehanort still possessing Terra's body, while Ventus' heart reconnects with and rests inside the heart of a young Sora.|$|E

5|$|Juvenile magpies begin {{foraging}} {{on their}} own three weeks after leaving the nest, and mostly feeding themselves by six months old. Some birds continue begging for food until eight or nine months of age, but are usually ignored. Birds reach adult size by their first year. The age at which young birds disperse varies across the country, and depends on the aggressiveness of the dominant adult of the corresponding sex; males are usually evicted at a younger age. Many leave at around a year old, but the age <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> may range from eight months to four years.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish {{name for}} the archipelago, Islas Malvinas, derives from the French Îles Malouines— the name given to the islands by French {{explorer}} Louis-Antoine de Bougainville in 1764. Bougainville, who founded the islands' first settlement, named the area after the port of Saint-Malo (the point <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> for his ships and colonists). The port, located in the Brittany region of western France, was in turn named after St. Malo (or Maclou), the Christian evangelist who founded the city.|$|E
5|$|Alan {{receives}} {{a call from}} a man purporting to be Alice's kidnapper, demanding the pages <b>of</b> <b>Departure</b> in exchange for her. Meeting at a state park, Alan is about to turn over the pages when the man is consumed by a dark tornado and Alan is knocked out. He awakes in Barry and Dr. Hartman's care in the lodge overlooking Cauldron Lake. Dr. Hartman listens to Alan's story, and believes he is suffering a psychotic break; everything that he's witnessed being part of his imagination. Alan attempts to escape the lodge as the shadowy force starts to attack it; while running, Alan finds evidence that Dr. Hartman is aware of the supernatural events surrounding the lake. Barry helps Alan to escape the lodge before the shadow subsumes it and all those inside. Returning to town, they find the FBI have arrived, and attempt to arrest him, before the shadowy forces intervene, allowing Alan and Barry to escape.|$|E

5|$|As the division's assault units {{began their}} {{approach}} march towards the line <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> {{late on the}} evening of 6 June, the German artillery opened up with a gas bombardment that severely hindered the march, breaking up the assaulting units as men became lost. Suffering over 2,000 casualties before the battle even began, many of the division's assault units reached their assembly points with less than 200 men, nevertheless they arrived on time and at the appointed hour, after a number of mines were exploded in front of their positions, the assault began. The exploding mines had destroyed {{a large part of the}} German line and as a result initial resistance was quickly overcome by the division's lead battalions—the 33rd, 34th, 38th and 39th—and by 5am, the division had gained the crest of the Messines ridge and began digging in to defend against a possible counter-attack. In the engagements that followed the division largely played only a supporting role.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 3rd {{millennium}} BC, Erbil {{is mentioned}} in historical records of the Ur III period as Urbilum. King Shulgi destroyed Urbilum in his 43rd regnal year, and during the reign of his successor Amar-Sin, Urbilum was incorporated into the Ur III state. In the 18th century BC, Erbil appears in a list of cities that were conquered by Shamshi-Adad of Upper Mesopotamia and Dadusha of Eshnunna during their campaign against the land of Qabra. Shamshi-Adad installed garrisons in all the cities of the land of Urbil. During the 2nd millennium BC, Erbil was incorporated into Assyria. Erbil served as a point <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> for military campaigns toward the east.|$|E
5|$|Following the explosions, the Allied advance was {{virtually}} unopposed as the Germans were too stunned and demoralised {{to put up}} much resistance. However, not everything went the Australians' way. The 3rd Division, under Major General John Monash, suffered heavy casualties when they were shelled by phosgene gas and shrapnel shells while moving towards the line <b>of</b> <b>departure,</b> nevertheless the division still managed to get into position {{for the start of}} the attack. Strong German counterattacks were launched the next day, once again supported by concentrated artillery fire; however, the advance was able to continue on through the mess of concrete blockhouses the Germans had erected and continued on until all the objectives had been taken. Australian casualties amounted to nearly 6,800 men. On 2 July 1917, Major General Holmes was mortally wounded by a German shellburst while surveying the Messines battlefield with the Premier of New South Wales, William Holman.|$|E

5|$|In the north, 1 RAR was {{inserted}} into its new landing zone—LZ March— to the south-west. With B Company securing the site, the battalion moved on {{foot to the}} line <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> but not before they were mistakenly engaged by US helicopter gunships and artillery fire. However, after the Australians established communications, the shelling was halted and they began their advance. No sooner had the lead elements—D Company {{under the command of}} Major Ian Fisher—emerged into the cleared area that was originally to have been used as the battalion's LZ, when the forward platoon came under fire from Viet Cong positions in the tree-line on the north-east corner. In the action which followed, six Australians from 12 Platoon were wounded, including platoon commander Lieutenant Jim Bourke, who was shot through the jaw but remained in command until he passed out from loss of blood. Meanwhile, two medics who attempted to move forward to treat the casualties were themselves shot and killed.|$|E
5|$|In two years, a {{very precise}} map, drawn on six sheets at a 1/200,000 scale, was produced. In March 1829, {{a base of}} 3,500 meters had been traced in the Argolis, from one angle at the ruins of Tiryns to an angle of a house in ruins {{in the village of}} Aria. This was {{intended}} to serve as a point <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> in all the triangulation operations for topographic and geodesic readings in the Peloponnese. Pierre Peytier and Puillon-Boblaye proceeded to perform numerous verifications on the base and on the rulers used. The margin of error was thus reduced to 1 meter for every 15 kilometers. The longitude and latitude of the base point at Tiryns were read and checked, so that again the margin of error was reduced as far as possible to an estimated 0.2 seconds. 134 geodesic stations were set up on the peninsula’s mountains, as well as on Aegina, Hydra and Nafplion. Thus, equilateral triangles whose sides measured about 20km were drawn. The angles were measured with theodolites by Gambey.|$|E
