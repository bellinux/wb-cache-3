500|$|Anime News Network's reviewers found much {{to enjoy}} {{about the first}} series, {{although}} Theron Martin warns that the first DVD should be [...] "watched in small doses, as trying to tackle {{too much of it}} in one sitting will elevate the suicide rate <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>brain</b> cells". Carl Kimlinger comments that [...] "from the moment the words 'School Rumble' come spinning onto the screen, you know you're in for ... undiluted good times", and that the title is [...] "two of the greatest animation non-sequiturs you're likely to see anytime soon". Carlo Santos praises volume six's bizarre comedy, but laments its romantic elements as being too generic. Overall, his rating is mediocre, saying that [...] "although this disc technically marks the end of [...] School Rumble, it's really more of a pause, seeing as how the last few episodes simply ride along with the plot rather than try to reach a dramatic finish". Reviewers from Mania.com followed this pattern; Dani Moure was skeptical of the series' long-term entertainment value, but like fellow reviewer Danielle Van Gorder, found his early indifference fading as the story develops. IGN's Jeff Harris, N.S. Davidson, and David F. Smith gave mostly positive reviews, although Davidson believes the audio and extras had begun to wane by volume five. Jakub Lhota of Reanimated rated the first season an 8/10, stating that he enjoyed it more than some other anime series he had previously watched, and the style—if not always the color—of Funimation's metallic locker artbox for School Rumbles English translation of the first season was welcomed.|$|E

2500|$|Radiation therapy kills {{cancer cells}} by {{damaging}} their DNA (the molecules inside cells that carry genetic information {{and pass it}} {{from one generation to}} the next) (1).Radiation therapy can either damage DNA directly or create charged particles (free radicals) within the cells that can in turn damage the DNA. (2) Radiation therapy can lead to dry mouth from exposure of salivary glands to radiation. The salivary glands lubricate the mouth with moisture or spit. Post therapy, the salivary glands will resume functioning but rarely in the same fashion. Dry mouth caused by radiation can be a lifelong problem. [...] The specifics <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>brain</b> cancer radiation therapy plan will be based on several factors, including the type and size of the brain tumor and the extent of disease. External beam radiation is commonly used for brain cancer. The area radiated typically includes the tumor and an area surrounding the tumor. For metastatic brain tumors, radiation is sometimes given to the entire brain.|$|E
2500|$|While {{serving as}} Assembly Speaker, Brown was {{diagnosed}} with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a disease that still has no cure and that would slowly steal his eyesight. RP is a hereditary disease that causes a continual loss of peripheral vision and often leads to total blindness. Brown's two sisters were also diagnosed with RP. Brown remarked, [...] "Having RP is a challenge, as Speaker of the Assembly {{it was very important}} that I recognize people in the halls of the Legislature. But I couldn't see people unless they were right in front of me. I needed to have the security people give me notes to tell me who was in the room. Reading is also very difficult so I use larger print notes and memos. Living with RP means having to use more <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>brain</b> function—I listen more intently, I memorize vast amounts of information, and I have trained my computer to recognize numerous verbal commands."
