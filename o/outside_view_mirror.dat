To aid with the characterization of this complex flow field, mean and unsteady surface pressure measurements were undertaken in the wake of two mirror models. Velocity measurements with particle image velocimetry were also conducted to develop the mean velocity field of the wake. Two full-scale mirror models with distinctive geometrical features were investigated. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

5000|$|Rear View Mirrors.Not all {{motorcycles}} have rear <b>view</b> <b>mirrors.</b> Off road cycles do not.

40|$|Interior and {{exterior}} rear <b>view</b> <b>mirrors</b> are important aids {{for the car}} driver to obtain information on the traffic behind and beside the car. There {{seems to be a}} trend that more convex rear mirrors on cars are assembled.

Results show that for the left exterior rear <b>view</b> <b>mirror</b> the plane one should be preferred. For the right side only convex rear <b>view</b> <b>mirrors</b> fulfil to the specifications...|$|R
40|$|Every {{automobile}} has rear <b>view</b> <b>mirrors</b> {{and side}} <b>view</b> <b>mirrors</b> {{to make it}} easier for the driver to look at the rear side of the vehicle easily. They help the driver in moving the vehicle backwards without anyone's assistance. Usually, the rear <b>view</b> <b>mirrors</b> are located at the top of the windscreen and they are adjustable according to the position and viewing angle of the driver. During night times, the light from the head lights of the vehicle behind is reflected and falls directly on the eyes of the driver. This light reflection from the rear <b>view</b> <b>mirrors</b> causes a strain on our eyes and results in our eyes becoming tired and drowsy, consequently results in lack of alertness and can result in an accident. People who drive for more than 100 miles during the night experience this type of strain in their eyes. This can be avoided by reducing the reflection of light from the side <b>view</b> <b>mirrors</b> by implementing the process of electro chromism in the mirrors. By means of this process, we will be introducing a glass that changes the intensity of reflection when a voltage is applied...|$|R
