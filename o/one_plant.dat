He refers to <b>one</b> <b>plant</b> as Souljaboy Tellems, a reference to the performer Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, and another as Ludacrises, a reference to rapper Ludacris.|$|E
5|$|To develop {{resistance}} to RNAi, the {{western corn rootworm}} would {{have to change the}} genetic sequence of its Snf7 gene at multiple sites. Combining multiple strategies, such as engineering the protein Cry, derived from a bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), and RNAi in <b>one</b> <b>plant</b> delay the onset of resistance.|$|E
5|$|When two {{distinct}} types of organisms breed with each other, the resulting hybrids typically have intermediate traits (e.g., <b>one</b> <b>plant</b> parent has red flowers, {{the other has}} white, and the hybrid, pink flowers). Commonly, hybrids also combine traits seen only separately in one parent or the other (e.g., a bird hybrid might combine the yellow head of one parent with the orange belly of the other).|$|E

5|$|Solar One {{operated}} successfully from 1982 to 1988, {{proving that}} solar power towers work efficiently to produce utility-scale power from sunlight. The Solar <b>One</b> <b>plant</b> used water/steam as the heat-transfer fluid in the receiver; this presented several problems {{in terms of}} storage and continuous turbine operation. To address these problems, Solar One was upgraded to Solar Two, which operated from 1996 to 1999. Both systems had a 10 MW power capacity.|$|E
5|$|Some plants {{reportedly}} rely {{on using}} intoxicating chemicals to produce inebriated bees, and use this inebriation {{as part of}} their reproductive strategy. <b>One</b> <b>plant</b> that some claim uses this mechanism is the South American bucket orchid (Coryanthes sp.), an epiphyte. The bucket orchid attracts male euglossine bees with its scent, derived from a variety of aromatic compounds. The bees store these compounds in specialized spongy pouches inside their swollen hind legs, as they appear to use the scent (or derivatives thereof) in order to attract females.|$|E
5|$|The flower {{spikes of}} B. paludosa {{are unable to}} self-pollinate and require pollinators to set seed. A 1988 isozyme study showed very high rates of outcrossing; pollen from <b>one</b> <b>plant</b> is well-mixed among other plants in the locale. Nonflying mammals are {{important}} pollinators in heathland habitat, with the brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii) a frequent visitor to flower spikes. The sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) is another mammal pollinator. Bird species that have been observed foraging and feeding at the flowers include the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), yellow-faced honeyeater (Lichenostomus chrysops), white-eared honeyeater (L. leucotis), crescent honeyeater (Phylidonyris pyrrhoptera), New Holland honeyeater (P.novaehollandiae), and eastern spinebill (Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris). Insects recorded visiting flower spikes include the European honey bee and ants.|$|E
50|$|Ward {{was born}} on 16 February 1956 in Greytown, New Zealand. He was educated at St Patrick's College, Silverstream and also trained at Ilam School of Fine Arts at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. While still at art school he began writing and {{directing}} films. In 1978-81, he made the documentary In Spring <b>One</b> <b>Plants</b> Alone, which won the 1982 Grand Prix at Cinema du Reel (Paris), and a Silver Hugo at the Chicago Film Festival. In Spring <b>One</b> <b>Plants</b> Alone provides the starting-point for his later feature Rain of the Children (2008). His debut feature was Vigil (1984).|$|R

5|$|The Free State {{began using}} its new-found {{control of the}} region to levy taxes from the local population, {{gathered}} using similar hostage tactics to the Manyema. The taxes were initially collected {{in the form of}} ivory but when ivory supplies began to run low the Free State switched to natural rubber. The rubber was collected from Landolphia owariensis gentilii rubber vines which were relatively scarce in the area with an average frequency of around <b>one</b> <b>plant</b> in each acre. The rubber was gathered by tapping a rubber vine and placing a pot beneath to collect the latex which could be used in the production of rubber for the European market. If the vines were a long distance from the ground the gatherer would have had to climb a tree, tap the plant and hold the collecting pot beneath the vine, possibly for an entire day. Hence rubber collection was a labour-intensive process which made it unpopular with the villagers. Indeed, they preferred the Manyema to the Free State authorities as the Manyema only took low bulk, high value items such as ivory or slaves because of the long distances from their homeland whereas the state, with its steamboat transports, could afford to make the people harvest the low value high bulk rubber. By September 1892 the Free State was using its military forces to attack and occupy villages in the Lulonga and Maringa river valleys to expand its tax base.|$|E

25|$|To {{transmit}} from <b>one</b> <b>plant</b> {{to another}} and from <b>one</b> <b>plant</b> cell to another, plant viruses must use strategies that are usually different from animal viruses. Plants do not move, and so plant-to-plant transmission usually involves vectors (such as insects). Plant cells are surrounded by solid cell walls, therefore transport through plasmodesmata is the preferred path for virions to move between plant cells. Plants have specialized mechanisms for transporting mRNAs through plasmodesmata, and these mechanisms {{are thought to be}} used by RNA viruses to spread from one cell to another.|$|E
5000|$|Row covers {{are useful}} for keeping insects out of <b>one’s</b> <b>plants,</b> {{typically}} used for horticultural crops. They are made out of either plastic or polyester. They are made thin and light to allow plants to still absorb sunshine and water from the air.|$|R

25|$|The {{ability of}} the same AM fungi to colonize many species of plants has {{ecological}} implications. Plants of different species can be linked underground to a common mycelial network. <b>One</b> <b>plant</b> may provide the photosynthate carbon {{for the establishment of}} the mycelial network that another plant of a different species can utilize for mineral uptake. This implies that arbuscular mycorrhizae are able to balance below-ground intra–and interspecific plant interactions.|$|E
