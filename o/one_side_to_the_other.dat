25|$|When open, doors admit people, animals, {{ventilation}} or light. The door is used {{to control}} the physical atmosphere within a space by enclosing the air drafts, so that interiors may be more effectively heated or cooled. When closed, a door normally impedes the transfer of air from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Similar structures that do allow air to be transferred through some form of a grillwork are called gates.|$|E
25|$|To begin {{making a}} rug, one needs a {{foundation}} consisting of warps and wefts: Warps are strong, thick threads of cotton, wool or silk which {{run through the}} length of the rug. Similar threads which pass under and over the warps from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> are called wefts. The warps {{on either side of the}} rug are normally plied into one or more strings of varying thickness that are overcast to form the selvedge.|$|E
25|$|A funnel {{water slide}} {{requires}} riders {{to sit in}} a 2 or 4 seater round tube. Riders drop from inside a tunnel out into the ride's main element shaped like a funnel on its side. Riders oscillate from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> until they exit through the back of the funnel and into a splash pool. The most common type of funnel is the ProSlide Tornado which is installed at almost 60 locations around the world dating back to 2003. In 2010, WhiteWater West began developing a competing product known as the Abyss, utilizing a raft that holds up to six riders.|$|E

50|$|For a {{long time}} I had {{realized}} that this uncertainty was the greatest agony of all. I had seen too many trembling hand stretched out for the sheet of paper that we had at last succeeded in getting from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other: the Red Cross card.|$|R
25|$|Another notable {{feature in}} some stories {{is that the}} arms {{are said to be}} {{connected}} to each other through the torso and can slide from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> While they are primarily water creatures, they do on occasion venture onto land. When they do, the plate can be covered with a metal cap for protection. In some versions of the legends, kappa spend spring and summer in the water, {{and the rest of the}} year in the mountains as Yama-no-Kami (山の神, “mountain gods”). Although they are reported to live throughout Japan, they are often said to be particular to Saga Prefecture.|$|E
25|$|Sweep rowers (one oar per person) and scullers (two oars, {{one in each}} hand) {{have similar}} stroke styles, with some {{differences}} to accommodate the number of oars held by the rower. The most notable {{difference is that the}} oar handles overlap in sculling at the midpoint of the drive, and again during the recovery. This requires the sculler to cross one hand over (left over right) and/or {{in front of the other}} hand to avoid the oar handles colliding. While sculling is a fully symmetrical movement (with exception of the handle overlap), sweep oar rowing is slightly asymmetrical and many rowers strongly prefer <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{inscriptions}} on the stele are badly preserved. They {{fill the}} negative {{spaces in the}} scenes and run continuously from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> The text is written in Sumerian cuneiform script. From these inscriptions, {{it is known that}} the stele was commissioned by Eannatum, an ensi or ruler of Lagash around 2460 BC. On it, he describes a conflict with Umma over a tract of agricultural land located between the two city-states. The conflict ends in a battle in which Eannatum, described as the beloved of the god Ningirsu, triumphs over Umma. After the battle, the leader of Umma swears that he will not transgress into the territory of Lagash again upon penalty of divine punishment.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> and diagonals of a quadrilateral, {{some important}} segments {{are the two}} bimedians (connecting the midpoints of opposite sides) and the four maltitudes (each perpendicularly connecting <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> midpoint of the opposite side).|$|R

25|$|At {{the death}} of his father in 1909, he became the head of the Mikhailovichi branch of the Romanov family and {{inherited}} great wealth. He received all of the lands and houses of his father: Borjomi, his large rural estate in Georgia where he enjoyed living and preferred to work; Mikhailovskoe outside St Petersburg; an enormous palace on the Neva in St Petersburg, and the great estate Grushovka in southern Ukraine. His primary residence was the palace on the Neva, which was so large that his brother Grand Duke Sergei, who lived with him, used a bicycle to go from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Between his two residences in the capital region, he employed more than 400 servants.|$|E

500|$|The raised {{forecastle}} and {{the prominent}} sheer and flare {{of the bow}} ensured that the Chacal-class ships were good seaboats, but they proved to be topheavy with poor lateral stability despite [...] bilge keels. Furthermore, they were not very maneuverable because the [...] rudder was too small and its servomotor too weak (taking 25–30 seconds to move from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other).</b>|$|E
5000|$|In his memoirs, Stig {{described}} his success by saying, [...] "We gave football a chance. We never let ourselves be guided on.

50|$|The {{original}} residence, called Baroona, {{was designed}} by Benjamin Backhouse and built in 1866 for William Draper Box on land which the architect had alienated in 1861 and Box acquired in 1865. The property extended from Baroona Road on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outskirts of Torwood on the other.|$|R
50|$|Another {{trait of}} Polasek’s work is his {{emphasis}} on all perspectives of a sculpture being important. He favored pieces that presented <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> viewer above all others, but felt that the other sides played a part as well, and once had an argument with another artist on the topic. The other sculptor claimed that a piece should be sculpted <b>to</b> present only <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> viewer, and {{that the rest of}} the sides were, more or less, useless. As a retort <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sculptor’s later comment that it is impossible <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> ends of a flat composition interesting, Polasek sculpted a piece entitled “Aspiration,” for which he won the Widener Gold Medal in 1915, which demonstrates that all sides of a sculpture can be interesting.|$|R
500|$|Species form [...] "a {{branching}} series, irregularly graduated {{which has}} no discontinuity in its parts, or which, at least, if its true {{that there are some}} because of lost species, has not always had such. It follows that the species that terminate each branch of the general series are related, at least on <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> neighboring species that shade into them".|$|E
500|$|As {{the game}} progresses, {{elements}} {{are added to}} increase the difficulty. Fireballs either bounce around the screen or travel directly from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> and icicles form under the platforms and fall loose. Bonus rounds give the players a chance to score extra points and lives by collecting coins without {{having to deal with}} enemies; the [...] "POW" [...] block regenerates itself on each of these screens.|$|E
500|$|The liner {{passes the}} Statue of Liberty and leaves New York Harbor. [...] After some time, a German {{submarine}} {{cuts through the}} waters and fires a torpedo at the Lusitania, which billows smoke that builds until it envelops the screen.

50|$|Those reading reviews on {{products}} and services are likely to view reviews which only tell <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> story. This is a disadvantage to both a potential customer and seller as the review may not tell {{the other side of}} a story which may be based on a misunderstanding.|$|R
500|$|Following the explosion, Prince of Wales was {{targeted}} by both German ships and disengaged from combat after seven direct hits, four by Bismarck and three by Prinz Eugen, at about 06:09. During this brief engagement, Prince of Wales had also hit Bismarck three times, first striking the commander's boat {{and putting the}} seaplane catapult amidships out of action. The second shell passed right through the bow from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> The third struck the hull underwater and burst inside the ship, flooding a generator room and damaging the bulkhead of an adjoining boiler room, partially flooding it. The damage caused to Bismarck by these two shots allowed [...] of water into the ship.|$|E
500|$|Trauma or illness {{may also}} {{result in a}} cow unable to rise to its feet. [...] Such animals are {{sometimes}} called [...] "downers." [...] Sometimes this {{occurs as a result}} of muscle and nerve damage from calving or a disease such as mastitis. [...] Leg injuries, muscle tears, or a massive infection of some sort may also be causes. Downer cows are encouraged to get to their feet and have a much greater chance of recovery if they do. If unable to rise, some have survived—with medical care—as long as 14 days and were ultimately able to get back on their feet. Appropriate medical treatment for a downer cow to prevent further injury includes rolling from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> every three hours, careful and frequent feeding of small amounts of fodder, and access to clean water.|$|E
500|$|... "Dream Scene" [...] is a {{combination}} of segments that Harrison edited together. Along with [...] "Ski-ing", it is the only track on the album that combines Indian and Western music. The song consists of three distinct pieces, the first of which is a meditative section featuring phase-shifted instrumentation such as tabla tarang, harp (swarmandal) and sitar, and singing. The music is delivered via backwards-played tape loops as the vocals pan from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> across the stereo image. The other two pieces include a section comprising Barham's piano and flutes, followed by a trumpet solo, harmonica interspersed with a police siren, and more backwards tape loops. The song fades out with a slowed-down spoken voice over the sound of church bells. Leng notes that [...] "Dream Scene" [...] was recorded several months before Lennon's experimental sound collage [...] "Revolution 9", released on the double album The Beatles.|$|E
5000|$|The waterfall's name {{originates}} {{in a local}} legend of [...] "a fairy having leaped from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other", and {{is an example of}} a regional tradition of associating small streams with fairies. This waterfall was one of several features near Langholm described in the poetry of Hugh MacDiarmid.|$|R

500|$|For the 1984 season, Audi added two-time world {{champion}} Walter Röhrl to their star line-up and Mouton {{now had a}} part-time role, competing in five WRC events. For {{the first time in}} nine years, she did not enter the Monte Carlo Rally. However, Mouton signed up to commentate the event for Radio Monte Carlo. She started her year well by finishing second at the Swedish Rally behind teammate and home favourite Blomqvist. Mouton later stated that [...] "finishing second was fantastic. When you are out rallying on ice or snow in country like that it is like dancing. From <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side. My dancing background helped my rallying. As soon as I started on gravel I liked it because of that. It was so nice to feel and move the car like that. Sweden, in ice and snow, like ballet!" [...] This would remain her last podium position in the World Rally Championship.|$|E
500|$|From 1961 onwards, Card and USNS Core {{regularly}} docked in Saigon {{to unload}} heavy artillery, M-113 armored personnel carriers, aircraft, helicopters and ammunition for the South Vietnamese government. The Port of Saigon was situated between the Te and Ben Nghe Canals, {{and was about}} [...] wide from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> To facilitate the arrival of Card and other American ships which pulled into Saigon, the South Vietnamese military often deployed navy vessels to conduct patrols around the port, while the surrounding shores were protected by an elite Army of the Republic of Vietnam ("ARVN") airborne battalion. The port itself was guarded round the clock by South Vietnamese police, as undercover South Vietnamese agents operated across the river in the Thu Thiem area to disrupt Viet Cong activities there. Undeterred by the level of protection which the South Vietnamese government normally afforded to American ships, Tran Hai Phung—commander of the Viet Cong’s Saigon-Gia Dinh Military District—ordered the 65th Special Operations Group to attack USNS Card.|$|E
