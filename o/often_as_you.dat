500|$|On {{his return}} to St. James's Palace, Churchill's {{attention}} was drawn towards other matters, and to a fresh face at court. [...] "I beg you will let me see you as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can", pleaded Churchill {{in a letter to}} Sarah Jennings, [...] "which I am sure you ought to do if you care for my love..." [...] Sarah Jennings' social origins were in many ways similar to Churchill's – minor gentry blighted by debt-induced poverty. After her father's death when she was eight, Sarah, together with her mother and sisters, moved to London. As Royalist supporters (despite the fact that Sarah's great uncle, James Temple, was convicted of regicide), the Jennings' loyalty to the crown, like the Churchill's, was repaid with court employment, and in 1673 Sarah followed her sister Frances into the household of the Duchess of York, Mary of Modena, second wife to James, Duke of York.|$|E
500|$|Some {{reception}} of the film, however, was much more positive, in particular by reviewers for horror outlets. Michael Gingold of Fangoria gave it two-and-half out of four skulls, while Jonathan Barkan of Bloody Disgusting gave it {{four out of five}} skulls, stating it [...] "isn’t a movie meant to scare or make you think but {{it is one of the}} most entertaining and enjoyable movies of its kind that I’ve seen in years." [...] Scott Weinberg of FEARnet wrote that [...] "aside from some very clunky editorial missteps in the film's second half, there's a good deal of wit, enthusiasm, energy, and amusing attitude to be found in the dumb-yet-self-aware Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," [...] all while noting that he is [...] "not the type to act snobbish around a ridiculous film that obviously knows it's ridiculous." [...] According to Ryan Larson of Shock Till You Drop, the film [...] "is a mixed bag" [...] but [...] "fortunately, the lows don’t appear as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> would think," [...] and, [...] "if taken at face value, Hansel & Gretel is well worth the view." [...] William Bibbiani of CraveOnline, who criticized the film's inadequately [...] "limp" [...] marketing campaign, found the movie itself [...] "inherently stupid" [...] but in a good way, [...] "played with humor, ultraviolence and anachronistic fetish." [...] Cinema Blend's Sean O'Connell stated that the film is [...] "often mean and nasty, but that's really its saving grace." [...] Peter Paras of E! recommended this [...] "super violent, pretty funny flick" [...] for how it [...] "revels in the mayhem". Tom Russo of The Boston Globe, giving the film three out of five stars, called it a [...] "splattery fanboy fun. Preposterous, clearly, but fun." [...] Jonathon Natsis of Filmink wrote: [...] "Hansel and Gretel is not a 'film'. It's a 'movie', in all its unabashed, excitable glory...big on blood-soaked entertainment and low on pretension." [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave it four out of five stars, stating: [...] "This has all the elements of a classic action flick, and it's destined for cult status. Welcome to the most fun movie of 2013." [...] DVD Talk's Jamie S. Rich summed up: [...] "Is Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters a good movie? Probably not. At least not in any way that is defensible by regular critical standards. Is it a hell of a good time? Absolutely so. Unabashedly so. That's all it wants to be." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his First Epistle to the Corinthians (c. 54–55), Paul the Apostle {{gives the}} {{earliest}} recorded description of Jesus' Last Supper: [...] "The Lord Jesus {{on the night}} when he was betrayed took bread, {{and when he had}} given thanks, he broke it, and said, 'This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.' In the same way also the cup, after supper, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> drink it, in remembrance of me'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Our Lord Jesus Christ, on {{the night}} when He was betrayed, took bread, {{and when he had}} given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples and said, 'Take; eat; this is my body, given for you.

This cup is the New Testament in My Blood, shed for you for the {{forgiveness}} of sins. This do as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> drink it, in remembrance of Me.' ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} FourFourTwo magazine, McManaman stated, [...] "I think I {{probably}} least enjoyed my time when Glenn Hoddle was the manager. But I wouldn't {{say he was}} necessarily the worst. He had his ways of training and ways of acting and all managers have different ways of doing things; it's the same with club managers. Sometimes when you join up with England and you don't play as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> did under a certain other manager – then you'll think it's terrible. I loved going to play with England. For instance, I did {{get to go to}} the World Cup even though I only played for 17 minutes. That kind of experience leaves an indelible mark on your mind. So I don't really think of it in terms of [...] "worst"; but going to the World Cup and not playing much was a big thing for me, really, and that was under Glenn, of course." [...] Hoddle also notably arranged for McManaman to meet a disabled fan (and thus fulfill his lifelong wish of meeting McManaman) while the fan {{was on the verge of}} death, in 1997, to great media acclaim, though the story only broke a year after Hoddle had been sacked from the England job for alleged disparaging comments about disabled people.|$|E

WQKL is a Cumulus radio station, co-owned with country WWWW-FM 102.9, Sports Talk WTKA 1050, and WLBY 1290.

6000|$|... "Don't let Lady Southdown come again, Pitt," [...] {{said the}} old lady. [...] "She is stupid and pompous, like all your mother's family, whom I never could endure. But bring that nice good-natured little Jane <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>you</b> please." [...] Pitt promised {{that he would do}} so. He did not tell the Countess of Southdown what opinion his aunt had formed of her Ladyship, who, on the contrary, thought that she had made a most {{delightful}} and majestic impression on Miss Crawley.|$|R

50|$|Some {{play with}} a new declarer and dealer each round instead of every seven rounds.

My tales if <b>often</b> professional (<b>as</b> <b>you</b> remarked just now) have never been technical. So I'll just tell you that the ship was of a very ornamental sort once, with lots of grace and elegance and luxury about her. Yes, once! She was like a pretty woman who had suddenly put on a suit of sackcloth and stuck revolvers in her belt. But she floated lightly, she moved nimbly, she was quite good enough." ...|$|R

60|$|Peter Rabbit and Mrs. Quack the Mallard Duck {{are great}} friends. They {{have been great}} friends ever since Peter tried to help Mrs. Quack when she and Mr. Quack had spent a whole summer on a little pond hidden deep in the Green Forest because Mr. Quack had a broken wing and so he and Mrs. Quack simply couldn't keep on to their home in the Far North for which they had started. During that long summer Peter had become very well acquainted with them.

5000|$|In South Africa, pannekoek is {{typically}} used in singular: [...] "Kom ons eet pannekoek" [...] (Let's have pannekoek.) It is served with cinnamon and sugar; the cinnamon sugar mix is sprinkled over the pancake {{which is then}} rolled up and—unless consumed instantly—will be wrapped in wax paper to maintain warmth. The cinnamon and sugar melts into this warm and soft treat. It is <b>often</b> prepared <b>as</b> <b>you</b> watch at church bazaars, school fetes, and most any outdoor event which serves freshly cooked food such as barbecue (braaivleis).As a former Dutch colony, Indonesia also inherited the dish. It is locally known as Panekuk and is often eaten with sweet dressings such as honey, condensed milk, hagelslag or simply sprinkled with sugar. It is also a common practice to mix the dough with sliced banana fruits.|$|R

[...] "He {{may have}} learned about the {{portrait}} of Maria Vanrenen, which my grandmother always said was preserved at Gouda; and, indeed, I myself have <b>often</b> mentioned it, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> doubtless remember. If so, what more natural, say, for a rogue than to begin talking about the portrait in that innocent way to Amelia? If he wants a Rembrandt, I believe they can be turned out to order to any amount in Birmingham. The moral of all which is, it behoves us to be careful." ...|$|R
