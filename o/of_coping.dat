5|$|Although lesbian-feminism was a {{significant}} shift, not all lesbians agreed with it. Lesbian-feminism was a youth-oriented movement: its members were primarily college educated, with experience in New Left and radical causes, but they had not seen any success in persuading radical organizations to take up women's issues. Many older lesbians who had acknowledged their sexuality in more conservative times felt maintaining their ways <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> in a homophobic world was more appropriate. The Daughters of Bilitis folded in 1970 over which direction to focus on: feminism or gay rights issues.|$|E

5|$|Operational {{experience}} with the Nclass prototype demonstrated that it was capable <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> with peacetime passenger and freight traffic on the mainline between London and Ramsgate, but Maunsell anticipated an increase in traffic that would require a more powerful locomotive capable of hauling longer trains. The use of larger engines was prevented by low permitted axle loadings on parts of the SECR network, caused by economies in track construction by using flint beach pebbles as track ballast; this material failed to hold the track in place when under strain and could not support heavy locomotives. In the meantime Maunsell settled upon producing a 3-cylinder version of the Nclass 2-6-0, which provided the opportunity to test {{a variant of the}} Gresley conjugated valve gear developed by his assistant, Harold Holcroft.|$|E
5|$|The vital nature <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> {{with the}} lack of {{resources}} available in international emergency medicine may be seen in the proportion of scientific articles that grapple with the topic. Of the top 27 articles identified by a review of the international emergency medicine literature from 2010, 14 were classified as dealing with the practice of emergency medicine in resource-constrained environments. A new dimension of thought is that of the isolated subject of technology for trauma care as published in the World Journal of Surgery by Mihir Shah et al. Topics covered included the use of the Broselow tape as the best estimate for children's weight, green bananas as an effective treatment for diarrhea, and misoprostol as a potential alternative for postpartum hemorrhage when oxytocin is not available.|$|E
5|$|Treatments are varied {{because there}} are {{multiple}} perspectives of alcoholism. Those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or social support to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed to successfully prevent a relapse. An example {{of this kind of}} treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> mechanisms. The treatment community for alcoholism typically supports an abstinence-based zero tolerance approach; however, some prefer a harm-reduction approach.|$|E
50|$|Although the Jacobite {{army had}} secured {{the high ground}} to the south <b>of</b> <b>Cope's</b> army, they were dismayed by the natural {{advantages}} <b>of</b> <b>Cope's</b> position. A frontal Highland charge would flounder in the marshy {{ground in front of}} the Royalist army's centre and be shot to pieces by musket and cannon fire. Although there was much argument among the senior Jacobite officers, Lord George Murray was convinced that only an attack against the open left flank <b>of</b> <b>Cope's</b> army stood any chance of success. Jacobite Lieutenant Anderson was a local farmer's son who knew the area well and convinced Murray that he knew an excellent route through the marshlands. Following his advice, Murray began to move the entire Jacobite force at 4 am walking three abreast along the Riggonhead Defile far to the east <b>of</b> <b>Cope's</b> position.|$|R

5|$|With {{insensitive}} or unresponsive caregivers, or frequent changes, {{an infant}} may have few experiences that encourage proximity seeking to a familiar person. An infant who experiences fear but who cannot find comforting information in an adult's face and voice may develop atypical ways <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> with fearfulness {{such as the}} maintenance of distance from adults, or the seeking of proximity to all adults. These symptoms accord with the DSM criteria for reactive attachment disorder. Either of these behavior patterns may create a developmental trajectory leading ever farther from typical attachment processes such as {{the development of an}} internal working model of social relationships that facilitates both the giving and the receiving of care from others.|$|E
5|$|One of the Wattle Birds, Anderson's {{seventh and}} final novel, was {{published}} in 1994. Set in Sydney, it details three days {{in the life of}} Cecily Ambruss. Although the novel is ostensibly set in the present, the final paragraph of the novel reveals that the three-day sequence has been devised by Cecily as a means <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> with the fact that a year earlier, her mother, Christine had died of breast cancer, while Cecily had been away on holiday. Throughout the novel, Cecily attempts to resolve two quandaries: she does not understand why her mother did not tell her about that fatal illness and let her go overseas, refusing to let family members call her back, even for the funeral, nor why Christine included the cruel stipulation in her will that Cecily must marry before she can inherit. In addition to its adept depiction of the intricacies of social and family life, One of the Wattle Birds speaks to the process of writing and creating, as Cecily is herself a writer.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} study of inelastic lateral torsional buckling <b>of</b> <b>coped</b> beams with simply supported ends is presented in this paper. Six full scale coped steel I-beam tests were conducted. The test parameters include the aspect ratio <b>of</b> <b>cope</b> length to beam depth at coped region {{as well as the}} ratio <b>of</b> <b>cope</b> depth to beam depth. The results of tests were compared with finite element model results. The test results showed that a reduction in the inelastic buckling load due to coping could reach more than 60 % of the uncoped buckling capacity. A group of twelve finite element models for steel coped beams are investigated. The study takes into consideration variable parameters such as cope depth and length. A comparison between uncoped models and models with different geometrical parameters, is performed. The finite element results showed that both the cope length and cope depth have a significant influence on the lateral torsional buckling capacity. A parametric study <b>of</b> <b>coped</b> beams with stiffeners at coped region is reported in this paper. Based on the results <b>of</b> <b>coped</b> beams strengthened with either horizontal or vertical stiffeners, it is found that for cope depth to beam depth (dc/D) ⩾ 0. 25; both horizontal and vertical stiffeners are required to prevent local web buckling at the coped region...|$|R

40|$|When a {{beam flange}} is coped to allow {{clearance}} at the connection, the strength <b>of</b> the <b>coped</b> region will be reduced. Local web buckling at the coped region may {{occur when the}} cope length is long and/or the compression flange is braced. Experimental and analytical investigation of the strength <b>of</b> <b>coped</b> steel I beams were conducted {{by a number of}} researchers and design formula was also proposed. However, the proposed formula underestimates the local web buckling capacity <b>of</b> a <b>coped</b> I beam, especially when the cope-depth to beam-depth ratio is small. To improve this discrepancy, full-scale tests of the web buckling strength <b>of</b> <b>coped</b> steel I beams and a series of analytical studies were carried out. A modified plate buckling formula, which considers the shear buckling phenomenon at the coped region, is proposed. The modified formula gives a better prediction of the local web buckling strength <b>of</b> a <b>coped</b> I beam. The test-to-predicted ratios varies from 0. 92 to 1. 06.

25|$|Coping {{occurs in}} {{response}} to psychological stress—usually triggered by changes—in an effort to maintain mental health and emotional well-being. Life stressors are often described as negative events (loss of a job). However, positive changes in life (a new job) can also constitute life stressors, thus requiring the use <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> skills to adapt. Coping strategies are the behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that you use {{to adjust to the}} changes that occur in your life. The use <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> skills will help a person better themselves in the work place and perform {{to the best of their}} ability to achieve success. There are many ways to cope and adapt to changes. Some ways include: sharing emotions with peers, having a healthy social life outside of work, being humorous, and adjusting expectations of self and work. These coping skills will help turn negative emotion to positive and allow for more focus on the public in contrast to oneself.|$|E
