5|$|Severe {{childhood}} {{trauma is}} {{also associated with}} a general increase {{in the risk of}} drug dependency. Lack <b>of</b> <b>peer</b> and family support is associated with an increased risk of alcoholism developing. Genetics and adolescence are associated with an increased sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of chronic alcohol abuse. Cortical degeneration due to the neurotoxic effects increases impulsive behaviour, which may contribute to the development, persistence and severity of alcohol use disorders. There is evidence that with abstinence, there is a reversal of {{at least some of the}} alcohol induced central nervous system damage. The use of cannabis was associated with later problems with alcohol use. Alcohol use was associated with an increased probability of later use of tobacco, cannabis, and other illegal drugs.|$|E

Nevertheless, note that {{this approach}} becomes accurate as the number <b>of</b> <b>peers</b> online grows and approximates reality for a large enough number <b>of</b> <b>peers.</b> This happens because, for a large number <b>of</b> <b>peers,</b> the average capacity <b>of</b> <b>peers</b> inside and outside the ISP becomes equivalent and so does the chance <b>of</b> selecting <b>peers</b> inside and outside the ISP for some download.|$|R

From our results we conclude that factors related with sport's practice in the group <b>of</b> <b>peers</b> are: 1) That the group <b>of</b> <b>peers</b> to which the subject belongs practices and valuates sport practice; 2) all the aspects related with social relationships that sport can promote with the peers;; 3) Social aknowledgement provided through the practice of sport competition by the group <b>of</b> <b>peers.</b> Our results also proof that the most motivated adolescents by sport practice perceive that their friends v social relationships...|$|R
