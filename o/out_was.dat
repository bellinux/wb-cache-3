5|$|A major {{difference}} between And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient Express that Sheldon pointed <b>out</b> <b>was</b> that in the former, {{the premise of the}} novel was that no one solved the murder. This forced Sheldon to desperately {{try to find a way}} to integrate clues into the story so that the player could actually discover the murderer, although the game remained quite uninteractive. In Murder on the Orient Express, the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate clues to lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from Murder on the Orient Express, as they were an unpopular feature of its predecessor.|$|E

5|$|Adamant was one {{of eleven}} ships built to a 1767 design by John Williams, and one of five ordered between 1775-6. She was ordered from Peter Baker, of Liverpool, on 13 November 1776, and laid down on 6 September 1777.

5|$|Adamle's {{decision}} to drop <b>out</b> <b>was</b> controversial because {{of rules that}} under normal circumstances would have barred him from playing professionally before graduating. The interruption of the war had forced the suspension of the rule to account for players' military service, however, and {{he was allowed to}} leave college. The Browns denied that they encouraged Adamle to drop out. Adamle may have been convinced to join the Browns by Gene Fekete, Dante Lavelli, Lou Groza and Bill Willis, four Browns players who were back at Ohio State to finish their studies after the 1946 season.|$|E

The film grossed $90.4 million in its first weekend, making it the highest opening for an original title at the time. It accumulated over $857 million in worldwide box office revenue. The film received several awards, including a BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award, Critics' Choice Award, Annie Award, Satellite Award, and Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.|$|E

50|$|It {{is not a}} force {{out when}} a runner <b>is</b> put <b>out</b> while trying to tag up after a caught fly ball.

5|$|Richard's posthumous {{reputation}} {{has been}} shaped {{to a large extent}} by William Shakespeare, whose play Richard II portrayed Richard's misrule and his deposition by Bolingbroke as responsible for the 15th-century Wars of the Roses. Modern historians do not accept this interpretation, while not exonerating Richard from responsibility for his own deposition. While probably not insane, as historians of the 19th and 20th centuries believed, he may have had what psychologists today identify as a personality disorder, particularly manifesting itself towards the end of his reign. Most authorities agree that, even though his policies were not unprecedented or entirely unrealistic, the way in which he carried them <b>out</b> <b>was</b> unacceptable to the political establishment, and this led to his downfall.|$|E
