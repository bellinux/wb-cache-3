5|$|The Zytglogge's {{internal}} layout {{has changed}} over time to reflect the tower's change <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> from guard tower to city prison to clock tower.

5|$|The naturalism {{of natural}} {{selection}} conflicted with presumptions <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> in nature and while this could be reconciled by theistic evolution, other mechanisms implying more progress or purpose were more acceptable. Herbert Spencer had already incorporated Lamarckism into his popular philosophy of progressive free market human society. He popularised the terms evolution and survival of the fittest, and many thought Spencer was central to evolutionary thinking.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, {{he served}} as the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1946 to 1948. Then in 1950, Smith became the Director of Central Intelligence, {{the head of the}} Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other {{intelligence}} agencies in the United States. Smith reorganized the CIA, redefined its structure and its mission, and he gave it a new sense <b>of</b> <b>purpose.</b> He made the CIA the arm of government primarily responsible for covert operations. He left the CIA in 1953 to become an Under Secretary of State. After retiring from the State Department in 1954, Smith continued to serve the Eisenhower Administration in various posts for several years, until his retirement and his death in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Fear of {{the loss}} of one's purpose in life is a theme in Vonnegut's works. The Great Depression forced Vonnegut to witness the devastation many people felt when they lost their jobs, and while at General Electric, Vonnegut {{witnessed}} machines being built {{to take the place of}} human labor. He confronts these things in his works through references to the growing use of automation and its effects on human society. This is most starkly represented in his first novel, Player Piano, where many Americans are left purposeless and unable to find work as machines replace human workers. Loss <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> is also depicted in Galápagos, where a florist rages at her spouse for creating a robot able to do her job, and in Timequake, where an architect kills himself when replaced by computer software.|$|E
5|$|Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl drew on his {{imprisonment}} at Auschwitz in composing Man's Search for Meaning (1946), one of {{the most}} widely read works about the camp. An existentialist work, the book argues that individuals can find purpose even among great suffering, and that this sense <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> sustains them. Wiesel wrote about his own imprisonment at Auschwitz in Night (1960) and other works, and became a prominent spokesman against ethnic violence. In 1986, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.|$|E

5|$|The Field Spaniel {{can be a}} {{good family}} dog while it has a job to do. They are {{suitable}} for dog agility and hunting. Without some sort <b>of</b> <b>purpose,</b> the dog can often try to amuse itself and cause mischief. However, they are patient with children and like to stay close to their family. When socialised, they are good with other dogs. They are generally docile and independent, and are not as excitable as Cocker Spaniels. Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs lists the breed as being above average in working intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Crystal Palace {{began their}} first top flight {{campaign}} {{in almost a}} decade by re-signing Andy Gray from QPR for £500,000. In November, Palace hit the headlines when they signed Bristol Rovers goalkeeper Nigel Martyn for £1 million – a record for a goalkeeper in Britain. However, mixed form meant that the Eagles ended the season fifteenth after spending most {{of the first half}} in the top ten. But it was in the FA Cup that Palace really shone. After a succession of ties against lower division teams (Portsmouth, Huddersfield Town, Rochdale and Cambridge United), Palace reached the semi-finals, drawing the same Liverpool side that had beaten them 9–0 earlier in the season. The tie was played at Villa Park, and saw Liverpool score first and hold a seemingly comfortable 1–0 lead at half-time. However, Palace emerged from the half-time interval with a sense <b>of</b> <b>purpose,</b> and within a minute of the restart were level with Bright equalising. After going 2–1 up, they found themselves 3–2 down late in the match and were seemingly beaten. Then a late equaliser by Andy Gray took the game into extra-time, with the winner scored by Alan Pardew. The team secured a thrilling 4–3 victory {{and for the first time}} in their history, Palace were in the FA Cup Final.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, E.V. Ramasamy's chief lieutenant, Conjeevaram Natarajan Annadurai, {{established}} a separate association called the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), or Dravidian Progressive Federation. This {{was due to}} differences between the two, while Periyar advocated a separate independent Dravidian or Tamil state, Annadurai compromised with the Delhi government, {{at the same time}} claiming increased state independence. E.V. Ramasamy was convinced that individuals and movements that undertake the task of eradicating the social evils in the Indian sub-continent have to pursue the goal with devotion and dedication without deviating from the path and with uncompromising zeal. Thus, if they contest elections aiming to assume political power, they would lose vigour and sense <b>of</b> <b>purpose.</b> But among his followers, there were those who had a different view, wanting to enter into politics and have a share in running the government. They were looking for an opportunity to part with E.V. Ramasamy. Thus, when E.V. Ramasamy married Maniammai on 9 July 1948, they quit the Dravidar Kazhagam, stating that E.V. Ramasamy married maniammayar who was daughter of kanagasabhai when he was 70 and she 32. Those who parted company with E.V. Ramasamy joined the DMK. Though the DMK split from the Dravidar Kazhagam, the organisation made efforts to carry on E.V. Ramasamy's Self-Respect Movement to villagers and urban students. The DMK advocated the thesis that the Tamil language was much richer than Sanskrit and Hindi in content, and thus was a key which opened the door to subjects to be learned. The Dravidar Kazhagam continued to counter Brahminism, Indo-Aryan propaganda, and uphold the Dravidians' right of self-determination.|$|E
