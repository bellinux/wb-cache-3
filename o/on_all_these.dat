5|$|Black was the {{overriding}} colour for this period, with one exception. Streamlined locomotives Nos. 6245–6248 were outshopped at Crewe in 1943 painted plain black. The following two batches, Nos. 6249–6255, constructed without streamlining, were also painted unlined black; the lettering and numerals <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> locomotives was in serif style coloured yellow with red shading. From 1946 onwards de-streamlined locomotives were mostly repainted in black with LMS-style lining. The lining comprised a broad maroon centre with fine straw yellow edging. Lettering and numbers {{were in a}} sans-serif Grotesque font, coloured yellow with an inner maroon line. By the end of 1947, 29 of the 37 locomotives were painted thus.|$|E
5|$|Colleges {{arrange the}} {{tutorial}} teaching for their undergraduates, {{and the members}} of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., Nuffield College as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> levels: by the central university (the Bodleian), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).|$|E

25|$|Back at the Gaiety Theatre, Grossmith wrote, {{produced}} {{and starred in}} the hit in Theodore & Co (1916), based on a French comedy. Edwardes had died in 1915, however, and Grossmith was dissatisfied with the offer of the new management under Alfred Butt and Robert Evett, the executor of Edwardes's estate, and so he left the Gaiety and produced three successes, Mr Manhattan, Arlette (1917), and Yes, Uncle! (1917) elsewhere. His Oh! Joy (the British adaptation of Oh, Boy!, 1917) was also successful. He also wrote the tremendously successful revue series, The Bing Boys Are Here (1916), The Bing Boys are There (1917) and The Bing Boys on Broadway (1918). Grossmith fitted his work <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> productions around his naval service in World War I.|$|E

The defense moved {{to have the}} deposition from Andrea Constand's 2005 civil deposition thrown out. The judge said he would rule <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> motions at a later date. On September 16, 2016, O'Neill ruled that the recorded call between Constand's mother and Cosby {{would be allowed to}} be played in court. In his ruling he said that since the call was recorded in Canada, which deems recordings lawful with consent from only one party, it would be admissible. On December 5, 2016, O'Neill ruled that the deposition in the Constand civil case and any other evidence gathered by using it, would be allowed into the trial.|$|E
25|$|Kempe {{also showed}} {{correctly}} that G {{can have no}} vertex of degree 4. As before we remove the vertex v and four-color the remaining vertices. If all four neighbors of v are different colors, say red, green, blue, and yellow in clockwise order, we look for an alternating path of vertices colored red and blue joining the red and blue neighbors. Such a path is called a Kempe chain. There may be a Kempe chain joining the red and blue neighbors, {{and there may be}} a Kempe chain joining the green and yellow neighbors, but not both, since these two paths would necessarily intersect, and the vertex where they intersect cannot be colored. Suppose it is the red and blue neighbors that are not chained together. Explore all vertices attached to the red neighbor by red-blue alternating paths, and then reverse the colors red and blue <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> vertices. The result is still a valid four-coloring, and v can now be added back and colored red.|$|E

25|$|Though Knoop {{of course}} {{had been only}} four {{at the time of}} the battle, so he had no {{personal}} knowledge, he could avail himself of the recollections of many Dutch veterans who had been there, and as a general-staff member he had access to the after-battle reports the Dutch units had made within two days after the battle ended. (These archived reports could have been made available to Siborne, and in one case he appears to have been in actual possession of one, but he never bothered to consult them). As a trained historian, Knoop now started to research these sources and wrote a detailed repudiation of Siborne's book based <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> sources. This book (published with the explicit consent of King William II as a semi-official rebuttal), was received with much enthusiasm in Dutch military circles. When soon thereafter there was a false rumor in the Dutch press that captain Siborne was on his way to demand satisfaction, no less than six officers of horse-artillery spontaneoulsy offered to act as Knoop's seconds, if necessary. But Siborne stayed safely in England.|$|E

He was excited and happy to see her, and immediately offered to bring back the character for Phase II, describing the removal of Rand from The Original Series as his greatest mistake and blaming it on NBC executives.

500|$|Quatermass 2 {{received}} mixed reviews. Campbell Dixon in The Daily Telegraph {{found the}} film “all good grisly fun, {{if this is}} the sort of thing you enjoy”. The reviewer in The Times remarked that “the writer of the original story, Mr Nigel Kneale, and the director, Mr Val Guest, between them keep things moving at the right speed, without digressions. The film has an air of respect for the issues touched on, and this impression is confirmed by the acting generally”. On the other hand, Jympson Harman of the London Evening News wrote: “Science-fiction hokum can be convincing, exciting or just plain laughable. Quatermass II [...] fails <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> scores, I am afraid”. Similarly, the reviewer in the Daily Herald felt “The whole thing is daft and full of stilted dialogue.

500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{felt that}} the {{presence}} of a [...] "strong hook and a strong sense of fun" [...] was missing from the compilation, except for the song [...] "Your Honesty", which he declared as the best track despite feeling its beats to be a little outdated. He compared the work of the remixers as [...] "as subtle as a jackhammer, whether it's on the metallic-flaked [...] "American Life" [...] by Headcleanr or the '90s-retro Nevins mix of [...] "Nothing Fails". <b>On</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> mixes, Madonna sounds as if she's {{out of step with the}} music of 2003". Erlewine also compared Spears' vocals with that of Madonna's during her early days and Aguilera's with that of Cher's. Nathan Brackett of Rolling Stone commented that the release [...] "improves upon American Lifes standout single [...] "Love Profusion", but the rest botches an opportunity to revive interest on its parent album". Fabian from Daily Breeze commented that Remixed & Revisited [...] "is an amusing collection of novelties." [...] Sarah Crompton from Boston Herald proclaimed the album to be [...] "more fun than her full-length 2003 offering American Life."

500|$|A main {{element of}} Debuts sound is its {{incorporation}} of dance music, reflecting the contemporary styles of London's club culture, {{with which the}} singer had established close ties. While the echoes of subgenres such as Euro-house, acid jazz, worldbeat and IDM can be noted, [...] "they hadn't yet broken free from the primal thump of four-on-the-floor house music." [...] Tom Breihan of Stereogum asserts that [...] "even as dance music took <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> new sounds, that basic pulse was still {{the most important thing}} about it, and that pulse reverberates all through Debut." [...] Björk said: [...] "A lot of the songs on my record have dance beats, but I think they're beats that are more reflective of daily life—like life in the middle of the day in a city, as opposed to the night life of the clubs." [...] The [...] "four-on-the-floor" [...] style —typical of house music— is mostly evident in songs such as [...] "Human Behaviour", [...] "Crying", [...] "Big Time Sensuality", [...] "There's More to Life Than This" [...] and [...] "Violently Happy". Björk felt house music was [...] "the only pop music that [...] truly modern," [...] stating in 1993 that it was [...] "the only music where anything creative is happening today." ...|$|E
