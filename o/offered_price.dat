40|$|In {{the present}} paper we examine the setting of <b>offer</b> <b>prices</b> for Australian {{industrial}} initial public offers (IPOs) by fixed <b>price</b> <b>offers.</b> Our investigation focuses on the associations between <b>offer</b> <b>prices</b> and both market prices and accounting based measures of intrinsic value. Fixed-price offers {{are less likely to}} be influenced by the canvassing of market demand when compared to the US setting, where book-builds are typically used. We conclude that while Australian industrial IPOs are underpriced, they are not systematically undervalued. Contrary to research undertaken by Purnanandam and Swaminathan in the US book-build setting, we do not conclude that Australian IPOs are systematically overvalued. As part of our analysis, we develop an empirical model of <b>offer</b> <b>prices</b> based on interviews with several leading Australian stockbrokers involved in setting them. Finally, using the ratio of <b>offer</b> <b>price</b> to intrinsic value measure, we find some evidence that undervaluation is positively related to underpricing. ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the choice}} of an IPO <b>offer</b> <b>price</b> level {{would seem to have}} little {{economic}} significance, firms do not decide this arbitrarily. Our findings suggest that firms select their IPO <b>offer</b> <b>prices</b> to target a desired ownership structure, which in turn has implications for underpricing and post-IPO performance. Higher priced IPOs are marketed by more reputed underwriters and attract a relatively larger institutional investment. These IPOs are relatively more underpriced, possibly as compensation for the monitoring and information benefits provided by institutional investors. IPOs whose <b>offer</b> <b>prices</b> are below the median level seem to be targeted towards a retail investor clientele. These IPOs are also relatively more underpriced, possibly as a cost of adverse selection. Our finding that long-run performance increases with <b>offer</b> <b>price</b> confirms that higher priced IPOs are better firms. Initial public offerings; share prices; share allocation...|$|R

5000|$|... 12 Nov: Eurogroup and IMF will on {{the basis}} of the Troika report and the {{recently}} passed laws in the Greek parliament, consider to approve a revised bailout plan. It is rumoured the 2-year extension of the bailout plan will cost the Troika an additional €30bn. To help reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio, the Troika currently consider different proposals. The idea of another haircut or debt-write-off has been rejected by the Eurogroup. Instead the Eurogroup consider to offer [...] "Prolonged maturities and lower interest rates on existing loans", and/or a [...] "debt-buy-back" [...] of the remaining privately held Greek government bonds, currently listed with a face value of €63bn (of which €22bn are held by local banks and social security funds), effectively reducing the debt as their current market price is only 1/4 of the face value. In case of the launch of a debt-buy-back, this would in practical terms mean that the Troika for additional bailout funds should buy all the remaining privately held bonds at a fixed <b>offered</b> <b>price</b> close to the market price; an operation that essentially will also need the acceptance of private investors to sell their Greek government bonds at the <b>offered</b> <b>price.</b> If all private investors accept a debt-buy-back at 30% of the face value (being the expected average offer price according to Commerzbank), it would require the Troika to issue €18.9bn of new debt to finance the transaction, resulting in a net debt reduction for Greece at €44.1bn (equal to a debt-to-GDP ratio decline of 23%).|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: In this thesis, I {{study the}} {{precision}} of the initial takeover offers and analyse whether the initial offer precision affects the takeover contest outcomes. I examine to which extent <b>offer</b> <b>prices</b> per share are clustered at certain decimal fractions and whether the clustering depends on the nominal <b>offer</b> <b>price</b> size or the minimum tick size of the US stock exchanges. Most importantly, I study whether the initial <b>offer</b> <b>price</b> precision affects the success probability of the initial offer, the degree of <b>price</b> adjustment between <b>offers</b> within a takeover contest, {{the duration of the}} takeover contests and finally acquirer announcement returns. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: My sample consists of 2 673 initial control offers and related takeover contests on US based listed targets from 1980 to 2012. I form the takeover contests out of control offers where the acquirer aims to achieve majority ownership of the target. Moreover, I measure the <b>offer</b> <b>price</b> precision by the number of trailing zeroes and by selected decimal fractions based on the prior psychological, corpus and finance literature. The clustering analysis compares the <b>offer</b> <b>price</b> decimal distributions to distributions according to Benford's law. The analysis of contest outcomes is performed with univariate analysis, ordinary least squares and logistic regressions as well as with specific Cox proportional hazard model for the contest duration. FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: The results indicate that <b>offer</b> <b>price</b> per share are heavily clustered at decimal fractions of 00, 25, 50 and 75 and other multiples of ten cents. Almost 88 % of the <b>offer</b> <b>prices</b> have a decimal fraction of 00, 25, 50 or 75. The degree of clustering appears to be much greater than in the case of share prices. In addition, the clustering increases with the nominal <b>offer</b> <b>price</b> size. Precise initial offers are up to 10 % more likely to be completed at their initial terms. Furthermore, univariate analysis indicates that precise initial offers are less often challenged or revised. The contests initiated with precise initial offers are up to 5 % less likely to contain an upward adjustment of the <b>offer</b> <b>price</b> and the adjustment is on average one percentage point smaller. Moreover, the results indicate that precise initial offers significantly shorten the contest duration. Finally, the announcers of precise initial offers have 1. 8 percentage points greater announcement returns but unlike in the case of other analyses the effect is not significant for all precision variables...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to establish the possible influence of variation in IPO <b>offer</b> <b>price</b> levels on underpricing. Issuers can control the IPO <b>offer</b> <b>price.</b> According to tradionalists, the <b>offer</b> <b>price</b> itself should not have an influence on the amount of underpricing. However, studies on IPO underpricing exclude issues with <b>offer</b> <b>prices</b> below a certain minimum, since including these issues would distort the results. Furthermore, average share prices vary substantially between geographical areas, or single currency areas. The main research question of this thesis is: Does variation in the absolute and relative value of the IPO <b>offer</b> <b>price</b> explain variation in underpricing in Europe? Research in the U. S. concentrating on the price level of offerings and underpricing seems to be limited to two studies. Bradley, Cooney, Dolvin & Jordan (2006) found that penny stock IPOs are significantly more underpriced than other IPOs, with tests suggesting that the higher amount of underpricing is primarily related to the low <b>offer</b> <b>price.</b> Fernando, Krishnamurthy & Spindt (2004) found that besides low-priced IPOs, high-priced IPOs are more underpriced as well. This thesis extents the research on the relationship between price levels and underpricing by investigating whether the results that have been found in the U. S. will hold in Europe. A distinction has been made between IPOs in Euros and IPOs in British Pounds, since average share price levels in British Pounds seem to be much lower than average share price levels in Euros; conversion into another currency could obscure the results. Based on a sample of 1056 IPOs in British Pounds and 510 IPOs in Euros, starting in 1992 and 2001 respectively, separate regression analyses are performed to establish potential variation in underpricing for different <b>offer</b> <b>price</b> ranges. This thesis finds strong evidence that lower IPO prices in the GBP single currency union are related to higher underpricing, and marginal evidence that higher IPO prices in the Euro single currency union are related to higher underpricing. The results of the GBP regression equation suggest that there is a relatively strong relationship between underpricing and price range within the GBP single currency union, as the independent variable price range explains 17, 1 % {{of the variance in the}} dependent variable underpricing. The outcomes suggest that investors, on average, can make higher first-day returns when the invest in lower priced IPOs in the Pound single currency area, and issuers in the Pound single currency area will, on average, face lower underpricing when they decide to issue their stock at <b>offer</b> <b>prices</b> above the two lowest quintiles. Moreover, it seems fair to suggest that differences in geographical norms are the main cause of variation in the average <b>offer</b> <b>prices</b> between the two samples. Average <b>offer</b> <b>prices</b> in British pounds are significantly lower than average <b>offer</b> <b>prices</b> in Euros at the p < 0, 01 level...|$|R
40|$|When {{a company}} goes public, it is {{standard}} practice that the underwriting syndicate allocates more shares than are issued.
