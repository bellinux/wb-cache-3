40|$|<b>Organophosphorus</b> <b>{{insecticides}}</b> {{have been}} the most applied group of insecticides for the last two decades. Their main toxic effects are related to irreversible inactivation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Actually, they covalently bind to serine OH group in the enzyme active site forming phosphorylated enzyme that cannot hydrolyze acetylcholine. <b>Organophosphorus</b> <b>insecticides</b> in the environment undergo the natural degradation pathway including mainly homogeneous and heterogeneous hydrolysis (especially at high pH) generating non-inhibiting products. Additionally, thio organophosphates are easily oxidized by naturally present oxidants and UV light, forming more toxic and stable oxons. Thus, oxidative degradation procedures, generally referred as advanced oxidation processes (AOP), have been applied for their efficient removal from contaminated waters. The most applied bioassays to monitor the organophosphate toxicity i. e. the detoxification degree during AOP are Vibrio fischeri and AChE bioassays. Vibrio fischeri toxicity test exploits bioluminescence as the measure of luciferase activity of this marine bacterium, whereas AChE bioassay is based on AChE activity inhibition. Both bioanalytical techniques are rapid (several minutes), simple, sensitive and reproducible. Vibrio fischeri test seems to be a versatile indicator of toxic compounds generated in AOP for <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>insecticides</b> degradation. However, detection of neurotoxic AChE inhibitors, which can be formed in AOP of some organophosphates, requires AChE bioassays. Therefore, AChE toxicity test is more appropriate for monitoring the degradation processes of thio organophosphates, because more toxic oxo organophosphates might be formed and overlooked by Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition. In addition, during organophosphates removal by AOP, compounds with strong genotoxic potential may be formed, which cannot be detected by standard toxicity tests. For this reason, determination of incidence of micronuclei and cell proliferation index in cultivated human lymphocytes and fibroblasts is suitable for evaluation of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>insecticides</b> and their break down products inducing cytogenetic damage...|$|R

40|$|Background: Our study {{sought to}} assess the {{effectiveness}} of a constant micropump infusion of atropine and pralidoxime chloride compared with repeated-bolus doses in patients with severe acute <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>insecticide</b> poisoning (AOPP). Methods: A total of 60 patients with severe AOPP, defined as cholinergic crisis with respiratory failure or cerebral edema, were randomly divided into two groups of 30 patients each. In the experimental group, patients received a continuous micropump of atropine and pralidoxime chloride; in the control group, patients were given intermittent injections of atropine and pralidoxime chloride. Primary outcome measures were the dose of atropine required for atropinization, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score at atropinization, time to atropinization and acetylcholinesterase (AchE) recovery time. Additionally, the case fatality rate was measured as a secondary outcome. Results: Compared to patients in the control group, the time to atropinization, AchE recovery time, dose of atropine when atropinization occurred, and APACHE II score in the experimental group showed a statistically significant therapeutic effect (p <  0. 05), and the case fatality rate of the experimental group was lower than that of the control group (p <  0. 05).
