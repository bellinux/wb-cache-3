40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{investigation of the}} genetic structure of <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus declivis, Carangidae) in south-eastern Australian waters was conducted by using restriction enzyme analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Seventy-five <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> samples were collected from two localities: off Eden in New South Wales and off south-eastern Tasmania. Fish were sampled twice at each locality. Mitochondrial DNA was extracted from developing ovary tissue and heart tissue. The 75 <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> samples were screened with 11 six-base and four four-base enzymes. The level of genetic diversity in <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> was low. The six-base enzyme analysis found limited evidence of reproductive isolation between New South Wales and Tasmanian samples of <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel.</b> However, an analysis of a subset of 42 <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> with four four-base enzymes found evidence of temporal differences in the mtDNA diversities of two Tasmanian samples of <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel...</b>|$|R

40|$|South Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel,</b> Trachurus murphyi, has an ocean-scale distribution, {{from the}} South American {{coastline}} to New Zealand and Tasmania. This fish, captured by Humans since the Holocene, is nowadays heavily exploited and its population has decreased substantially since the mid- 1990 s. The uncertainty associated to <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> population structure currently hampers management. Several hypotheses {{have been proposed}} from a single population up to several discrete populations. Still no definitive answer was given. Determining how environmental conditions drive <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> distribution can provide insights on its population structure. To do so, here we performed in three steps. First, we used satellite data to develop a statistical model of <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> horizontal habitat suitability. Model predictions based on interaction between temperature and chlorophyll-a match the observed <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> distribution, even during extreme El Niño event. Second, we studied the impact of oxygen and show that <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> distribution and abundance is correlated to oxygen over {{a wide variety of}} scales and avoid low oxygen areas and periods. Third, {{on the basis of the}} above we built a conceptual 3 D model of <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> habitat in the Southeastern Pacific. We reveal the presence of a low suitable habitat along the Chilean and Peruvian coast, figuratively presenting a closed door caused by a gap in the horizontal habitat at ∼ 19 – 22 °S and a shallow oxycline off south-centre Peru. This kind of situation likely occurs on a seasonal basis, in austral summer but also at longer temporal scales. A lack of exchanges at some periods/seasons partially isolate <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> distributed off Peru. On the other hand the continuity in the habitat during most of the year explains why exchanges occur. We conclude that the more likely population structure for <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> is a pelagic metapopulation...|$|R
50|$|The Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus symmetricus) (also {{known as}} the Californian <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> or simply <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel),</b> is an {{abundant}} species of pelagic marine fish in the jack family, Carangidae. The species is distributed along the western coast of North America, ranging from Alaska in the north to the Gulf of California in the south, inhabiting both offshore and inshore environments. The Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> is a moderately large fish, growing to a maximum recorded length of 81 cm, although commonly seen below 55 cm. It is very similar in appearance to other members of its genus, Trachurus, especially Trachurus murphyi, which was {{once thought to be}} a subspecies of T. symmetricus, and inhabits waters further south. Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> travel in large schools, ranging up to 600 miles offshore and to depths of 400 m, generally moving through {{the upper part of the}} water column.|$|R
50|$|Three {{species of}} <b>jack</b> <b>mackerels</b> {{are found in}} coastal waters around New Zealand: the Australasian, Chilean and Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerels.</b> They are mainly {{captured}} using purse seine nets, and are managed as a single stock that includes multiple species.|$|R
5000|$|The Chilean <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus murphyi), {{the most}} intensively {{harvested}} mackerel-like species, {{is found in}} the south Pacific from West Australia to the coasts of Chile and Peru.

40|$|The {{study on}} Hydrography and <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel</b> stock (Trachurus murphyi) in the South Pacific is {{currently}} one year underway. The main achievement consisted of collecting detailed datasets on Chilean, Peruvian and European fisheries activities {{and information on}} the hydrographical / biochemical and environmental conditions present in the South Pacific. The hydrographical and environmental datasets {{are based on the}} analyses of available acoustic information collected on-board survey and fishing vessels and satellite imagery data. <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel</b> habitat models are being developed based on these datasets. These models will be used to produce maps of the potential habitat of <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel,</b> on the basis of which different stock structure hypotheses will be tested. The models developed so far are able to accurately represent the distribution of <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel</b> as observed by fishing and surveying activities, although some additional investigations are needed to improve the statistical fits. Good fits with hydrographical conditions have been found. The models are not yet ready to be used for testing stock structure hypotheses, but this should be the case in the near future. During {{the first year of the}} project, an extensive literature review on <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel</b> has also been conducted, and a synthesis has been written, giving an overview on the species biology, ecology and stock structure. The literature suggests that a meta-population structure can be seen as a potential stock structure hypothesis. The literature review also contributed to identify environmental variables that should be crucial to define the suitable habitat of <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel.</b> Previously published results indicate, among others, temperature and dissolved oxygen ranges in which <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel</b> is able to survive. Finally, a framework to derive reference points for <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel,</b> assuming the single stock structure as used within the SPRFMO assessment, has been developed and made available to the SPRFMO Science Committee for review. Analyses of the assessment results within this framework indicate that the fishing mortality corresponding to maximum sustainable yield might be at around 0. 15 per year with a corresponding spawning stock biomass of around 10 million tonnes. Different harvest control rules have been evaluated and show little risk to overexploitation in the medium and long term, although these result heavily rely on strong incoming year classes. The tools to evaluate sustainable management options for the <b>Jack</b> <b>Mackerel</b> population, when a stock structure other than a single one is assumed, are currently under development. The design of scenarios to be tested depend on the results of the habitat modelling exercises. Therefore, preliminary results will only become available early 2014...|$|R
50|$|The Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> is {{classified}} within the genus Trachurus, {{commonly known as}} the horse <b>mackerels</b> or <b>jack</b> <b>mackerels.</b> Trachurus is part of the jack family Carangidae, a group of perciform fish in the suborder Percoidei.

25|$|Jacks, amberjacks, pompanos, horse mackerel, scads, leatherjackets and {{trevally}} are fish of {{the family}} Carangidae. Found in most coastal waters, they are fast predatory fishes that hunt in the waters above reefs and in the open sea; some dig in the sea floor for invertebrates (some can also filter feed, such as the white trevally). The largest fish in the family, the giant trevally, grows up to 1.7m in length; most fish in the family reach a maximum length of 25–100cm. The family contains many important commercial and game fish, notably the Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> and the other <b>jack</b> <b>mackerels</b> in the genus Trachurus.

50|$|On {{the eastern}} side of the south Pacific, the Chilean fishery {{operating}} mainly within its own EEZ has taken 75% of the global catch over the years. The Peruvian fishery captured 800,000 tonnes in 2001, but overall is an order of magnitude smaller. On the western side of the south Pacific, New Zealand fishes <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> mainly inside their own EEZ, peaking modestly at 25,000 tonnes in 1995-96. From 1978 to 1991, the USSR fishing fleet intensively fished the <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> belt on the high seas, taking 13 million tonnes.

40|$|The <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> before 1947, was {{of minor}} {{commercial}} importance {{having to take}} a back seat to the better known, more profitable, and more abundant Pacific sardine (Sardinops caeruleus) and the more desirable Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus). During these years it was referred to as "horse mackerel" and had relatively little market appeal. Much of the catch between 1926 and 1946 was absorbed by the fresh fish markets and consisted primarily of <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> taken from mixed sardine and Pacific mackerel schools. Landings were low, varying between 183 and 15, 573 short tons. During the 1947 - 48 season, the industry, after being hit hard by poor sardine landings, turned to the <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> as a substitute sardine and landed approximately 71, 000 short tons. <b>Jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> have been a major contributor to California's commercial landings ever since (Figure 1). In 1948, the U. S. Pure Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the common name <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> on all labeling. This name was expected to have more consumer appeal than the original official name "horse mackerel". The California Department of Fish and Game commenced routine length and age sampling of the commercial landings in 1947, the year the fishery first blossomed into being. Due to the apparent healthy condition of the resource and the need for emphasis on other fisheries these sample data have not been subjected to a complete analysis. We have recently completed the assignment of ages to the otoliths sampled and anticipate dedicating most of our effort in 1968 to writing a manuscript describing the fishery, its year-class composition and other factors affecting the yield.
