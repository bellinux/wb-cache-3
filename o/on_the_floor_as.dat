5|$|The other {{predominant}} rivalry {{heading into}} the event was between Matt Hardy and Edge, a real life issue transformed into a storyline. At SummerSlam, Edge defeated Hardy after dropping him onto {{the top of a}} ring post. This was scripted to caused Hardy to bleed heavily, which forced the referee to end the match and declare Edge the winner because Hardy could not continue. The next night on Raw, Hardy had a match with Rob Conway, in which Conway pinned Hardy for the win. After the match, Edge attacked Hardy. On the August 29 episode of Raw, Edge and Hardy were scheduled to compete in a Street Fight, a match where there are no disqualifications, no countouts, and scoring conditions can occur anywhere in the arena. The match ended in a no-contest after Hardy and Edge brawled at the stage ramp. Hardy grabbed Edge by the side and threw both himself and Edge off the stage and into electrical equipment. Both Hardy and Edge laid motionless <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>as</b> sparks flew everywhere. Trainers and emergency medical technicians rushed to the scene and took both men away in ambulances for medical attention. The following week, Bischoff booked Hardy and Edge in a steel cage match at Unforgiven, where the ring would be enclosed by a steel cage. Following the announcement, Bischoff scheduled a match between Hardy and Snitsky, which Hardy lost. After the match, Snitsky threatened to hit Hardy with a ring bell but The Big Show came down. He was unable to stop Snitsky, and as a result, Snitsky succeeded in hitting Hardy with the bell.|$|E

25|$|Because the {{delegation}} {{did not bring}} the expected number of captives, the members {{were taken to the}} local jail. The talks were held at the Council House, a one-story stone building adjoining the jail on the corner of Main Plaza and Calabosa (Market) Street. During the council, the Comanche warriors sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>as</b> was their custom, while the Texians sat on chairs on a platform facing them. Lockhart had informed the Texians that she had seen 15 other prisoners at the Comanches' principal camp several days before. She maintained that the Indians had wanted to see how high a price they could get for her, and that they then planned to bring in the remaining captives one at a time.|$|E

25|$|As {{the narrator}} reads of the knight's forcible {{entry into the}} dwelling, {{cracking}} and ripping sounds are heard somewhere in the house. When the dragon is described as shrieking as it dies, a shriek is heard, again within the house. As he relates the shield falling from off the wall, a reverberation, metallic and hollow, can be heard. Roderick becomes increasingly hysterical, and eventually exclaims that these sounds are being made by his sister, who was in fact alive when she was entombed. Additionally, Roderick somehow {{knew that she was}} alive. The bedroom door is then blown open to reveal Madeline standing there. She falls on her brother, and both land <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>as</b> corpses. The narrator then flees the house, and, as he does so, notices a flash of moonlight behind him which causes him to turn back, {{in time to see the}} moon shining through the suddenly widened crack. As he watches, the House of Usher splits in two and the fragments sink into the tarn.|$|E
25|$|Images of {{children}} {{on the path to}} destruction also litter the scene: aside from the dead baby on the spike and the child falling to its death, a baby is quieted by its mother with a cup of gin, and in the background of the scene an orphaned infant bawls naked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>as</b> the body of its mother is loaded into a coffin on orders of the beadle. Two young girls who are wards of the parish of St Giles—indicated by the badge on the arm of one of the girls—each take a glass. Hogarth also chose the slum of St Giles as setting for the first scene of The Four Stages of Cruelty, which he issued almost simultaneously with Beer Street and Gin Lane. Tom Nero, the central character of the Cruelty series wears an identical arm badge. In front of the pawnbroker's door a starving boy and a dog fight over a bone, while next to them a girl has fallen asleep; approaching her is a snail, emblematic of the sin of sloth.|$|E
25|$|Apparently {{dizzy and}} disoriented, Tunney grabbed {{on to the}} ring's top rope with his left hand. Dempsey, who used to stand over opponents and rush right back at them after they got up, looked down on Tunney. Referee Dave Barry ordered Dempsey into a neutral corner to no avail; Dempsey just stood there, observing his opponent. This gave Tunney {{precious}} seconds to recuperate. By the time Dempsey finally walked to a neutral corner, Tunney had been down for around 3 to 8 seconds. Barry could not start to count on Tunney until Dempsey reached the neutral corner, {{but he was still}} able to count to nine before Tunney got up. Some believe that if Dempsey had responded to the referee's orders in time, he would have likely regained the world Heavyweight crown with a seventh round knockout of Tunney. The validity of this argument has been debated even to this day. In the fight film, a clock was superimposed that recorded Tunney's time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>as</b> 13 seconds, from the moment he fell until he got up. Because of this delay, it became known as The Long Count Fight.|$|E

25|$|When Walter {{arrives in}} Albuquerque – on his 52nd {{birthday}} – he intimidates Gretchen and Elliott into putting his remaining {{money into a}} trust fund for Walter Jr. He then visits Skyler and gives her the location of Hank's body so she can clear herself as a suspect in his death, and finally admits {{to her that he}} entered the meth business for himself, not his family. As a token of appreciation, Skyler lets him see his children one last time. He then arranges to see Lydia, secretly poisoning her with ricin after learning where Jack has taken Jesse. Walt drives to Jack's compound and demands to see Jesse. When they bring Jesse, who has been chained up in a lab and forced to cook meth since his abduction, Walt dives atop him while simultaneously starting a remote machine gun mounted in his car that kills most of Jack's men. Walt and Jesse kill Jack and Todd. Walt urges Jesse to kill him, but Jesse notices Walt had been shot by his own trap and tells him to do it himself. Walt then finds that he has been fatally wounded. He answers a call from Lydia on Todd's phone and coldly informs her that she is going to die. He exchanges a knowing nod with Jesse, who escapes the compound. Walt takes a moment to admire the lab equipment that Jesse had been using, and finally succumbs to his wounds and collapses dead <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>as</b> the police arrive and sweep the lab.|$|E

500|$|In {{the days}} before Selena's death, Saldívar delayed handing over the bank {{statements}} and financial records by saying she had been physically and sexually assaulted in Mexico. Saldívar, along with Selena, appeared at a medical clinic on March 31, 1995, ostensibly to have Saldívar examined for an assault which she claimed happened to her in Monterrey. During that visit, Saldívar was given a brief physical examination by the clinic's doctor, but this {{did not include a}} gynecological exam specifically done in cases of sexual assault. It was suggested by nurse Carla Anthony that Saldívar needed to have the rape exam in San Antonio for three reasons: Saldívar was a resident of San Antonio, the clinic they were currently at was in Corpus Christi, and the assault occurred in Mexico. Afterwards, Selena again met with Saldívar in her hotel room at the Days Inn in Corpus Christi. At the hotel, Selena demanded the financial papers. At 11:48a.m. (CST), Saldívar got a gun from her purse and pointed it at Selena. As Selena attempted to flee, Saldívar shot her once on the right lower shoulder, severing an artery and causing a severe loss of blood. Critically wounded, Selena ran towards the lobby, leaving a -long trail of blood. She collapsed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>as</b> the clerk called the emergency services, with Saldívar still chasing after her and calling her a [...] "bitch". Before collapsing, Selena named Saldívar as her assailant and gave the number of the room where she had been shot. Meanwhile, Saldívar attempted to leave in her pickup truck. She was, however, spotted by a responding police cruiser. She surrendered after a nearly nine-and-a-half-hour standoff with police and the FBI. By that time, hundreds of fans had gathered at the scene; many wept as police took Saldívar away.|$|E

2500|$|After {{a series}} of filibusters in the 1960s over civil rights legislation, the Senate put a [...] "two-track system" [...] into place in 1970 under the {{leadership}} of Majority Leader Mike Mansfield and Majority Whip Robert Byrd. Before this system was introduced, a filibuster would stop the Senate from moving on to any other legislative activity. Tracking allows the majority leader—with unanimous consent or the agreement of the minority leader—to have more than one bill pending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>as</b> unfinished business. Under the two-track system, the Senate can have two or more pieces of legislation pending on the floor simultaneously by designating specific periods during the day when each one will be considered.|$|E

2500|$|Also in {{the fall}} of 1986, Hercules rekindled a feud with Billy Jack Haynes that went back through every {{promotion}} the two were ever in together, including the WWF earlier in 1986. As part of the feud, Hercules started using Haynes' finishing move, the full nelson submission hold, as his finisher. On an episode of WWF Wrestling Challenge, Heenan called out Haynes saying {{he would like to see}} him get out of Hercules' version of the hold. Haynes promptly answered the challenge and was waiting for Hercules to apply the hold when Heenan appeared to have second thoughts. Haynes grew tired of the charade and shoved Heenan. This gave Hercules the opening he needed to clothesline Haynes. Haynes was unable to defend himself and Hercules applied the full nelson and maintained the hold until Haynes passed out. This incident set the stage for their match at WrestleMania III at the Pontiac Silverdome in front of a reported 93,173 fans. The momentum swung back and forth throughout the contest until Haynes attempted to apply the full nelson; both men tumbled to the floor after Hercules reached the ropes. Haynes applied the full nelson <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>as</b> both men were counted out. Heenan broke the hold by driving a knee into the back of Haynes, who then turned his attention to Heenan and chased him into the ring, allowing Hercules to blindside him with a shot to the head with his steel chain wrapped around his fist, causing Haynes to bleed profusely (a closeup shot of Haynes on the mat clearly showed him [...] "blading" [...] himself in order to draw blood). The feud culminated some weeks later in a chain match that saw Hercules as the victor.|$|E
