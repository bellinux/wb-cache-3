25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, a nightclub owner in Tokyo, Tsutomu Katoh was {{consulted}} from a notable accordion player, Tadashi Osanai, about the rhythm machine he used for accompaniment in club, Wurlitzer Side Man. Osanai, {{a graduate of}} the Department <b>of</b> <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Engineering</b> <b>at</b> University of Tokyo, convinced Katoh to finance his efforts to build better one. In 1963, their new company Keio-Giken (later Korg) released their first rhythm machine, Donca-Matic DA-20 using the vacuum tube circuits for sounds and mechanical-wheel for rhythm patterns. It was a floor-type machine with built-in speaker, and featuring a keyboard for the manual play, in addition to the multiple automatic rhythm patterns. Its price was comparable with the average annual income of Japanese at that time.|$|E
