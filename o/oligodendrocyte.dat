5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} such as sphingomyelin and gangliosides {{are highly}} {{concentrated in the}} brain and support synaptogenesis and myelination. In the central nervous system, sphingomyelin is a key component of the myelin sheath, which insulates axons and supports efficient transmission of nerve impulses. During myelination, nerve axons are wrapped with multiple layers of cell membrane by <b>oligodendrocyte</b> glial cells, a process that accounts for a large portion of brain growth during late gestation and {{the first two years of}} life, but which can also continue up to 5–10 years of age. Meanwhile, gangliosides are concentrated within the brain’s gray matter and constitute approximately 6% to 10% of the total human brain lipid mass. Additionally, gangliosides are enriched at the synaptic membrane of neurons, and are functionally involved in neurotransmission and synapse formation. Brain ganglioside accretion occurs at an accelerated rate in the early years of life, coinciding with the most active period of myelination, axonal outgrowth, and synaptogenesis.|$|E

Based on the observed heterogeneity in morphology, we have grouped the presumptive <b>oligodendrocytes</b> into three categories termed 2 ̆ 7 parallel 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 stratified 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 radial 2 ̆ 7. Most parallel <b>oligodendrocytes</b> were tracer coupled to nearby <b>oligodendrocytes</b> and astrocytes, whereas the stratified and radial <b>oligodendrocytes</b> rarely showed coupling.

40|$|AbstractAxons in {{the central}} nervous system of mature mammals {{generally}} fail to regenerate following injury. Although the reason for this regenerative failure remains unknown, several lines of evidence suggest that it is due to nonpermissiveness of <b>oligodendrocytes</b> for axonal elongation. However, most of the in vitro experiments carried out so far used neural-crest-derived peripheral neurons to test the permissiveness of <b>oligodendrocytes,</b> although studying the interactions between central neurons and <b>oligodendrocytes</b> is crucially important for elucidating their roles in vivo. In this study we cultured retinas and dorsal root ganglia of the chick embryo with <b>oligodendrocytes</b> obtained from postnatal rat spinal cord and performed time-lapse analysis. <b>Oligodendrocytes</b> were identified with galactocerebroside antibody. Retinal growth cones readily grew over <b>oligodendrocytes,</b> while growth cones of the dorsal root ganglion collapsed and grew away on contacting the <b>oligodendrocytes.</b> Correspondingly, neurite-free areas centered by <b>oligodendrocytes</b> were formed behind growth cones in DRG-oligodendrocyte but not in retina-oligodendrocyte co-culture.

25|$|Loss of myelin in {{the central}} nervous system is {{considered}} to be a main pathogenic factor. Research uses animal models carrying the underlying mutation for Niemann-Pick disease, e.g. a mutation in the NPC1 gene Niemann-Pick type C disease.

MRF is a transcription factor of critical importance in the development and maintenance of myelin sheaths. A perturbation of <b>oligodendrocyte</b> maturation and the myelination process might therefore be an underlying mechanism of the neurological deficits.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY  Healthy <b>oligodendrocytes</b> {{are crucial}} for neurons and {{abnormal}} functioning of these cells {{is involved in}} several neurodegenerative diseases. We will focus on oligodendroglial pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an adult-onset progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective motor neuron loss. Recent discoveries shed {{new light on the}} crucial role of <b>oligodendrocytes</b> in this fatal disease. We will first give an overview of the importance of good-functioning <b>oligodendrocytes</b> for neuronal health, in particular for motor neurons. Subsequently, we will discuss the recent data on oligodendroglial abnormalities in ALS. We conclude that <b>oligodendrocytes</b> should be considered as important contributors to motor neuron degeneration. As a consequence, <b>oligodendrocytes</b> are a promising new therapeutic target for ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases. status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|After barrier {{breakdown}} symptoms may appear, such as swelling. Activation of macrophages and lymphocytes {{and their}} migration across the barrier {{may result in}} direct attacks on myelin sheaths within the central nervous system, leading to the characteristic demyelination event observed in MS. After demyelination has occurred, the degraded myelin sheath components, such as myelin basic proteins and Myelin <b>oligodendrocyte</b> glycoproteins, are then used as identifying factors to facilitate further immune activity upon myelin sheaths. Further activation of cytokines is also induced by macrophage and lymphocyte activity, promoting inflammatory activity as well continued activation of proteins such as matrix metalloproteinases, which have detrimental effect on BBB integrity.|$|E
25|$|Astrocytes {{are crucial}} in {{clearance}} of neurotransmitters {{from within the}} synaptic cleft, which provides distinction between arrival of action potentials and prevents toxic build-up of certain neurotransmitters such as glutamate (excitotoxicity). It is also thought that glia {{play a role in}} many neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, at least in vitro, astrocytes can release gliotransmitter glutamate in response to certain stimulation. Another unique type of glial cell, the <b>oligodendrocyte</b> precursor cells or OPCs, have very well-defined and functional synapses from at least two major groups of neurons. The only notable differences between neurons and glial cells are neurons' possession of axons and dendrites, and capacity to generate action potentials.|$|E
25|$|Neural {{stem cells}} could {{give rise to}} {{neuronal}} or glial progenitors, {{depending on the type}} of signals that they receive - gliogenic or neurogenic signals, respectively. Glial progenitor cells could differentiate into oligodendrocytes or astrocytes. However, lineage commitment of neural progenitors involves the suppression of alternative fates. Therefore, vertebrate proneural genes promote neuronal fates and simultaneously inhibit glial fates. For example, the downregulation of the expression of proneural gene ngn2 in the spinal cord represses <b>oligodendrocyte</b> differentiation. In the context of restricted glial progenitors, proneural genes might have functions that are distinct from their better-characterized role in lineage specification, perhaps in the differentiation of glial lineages.|$|E

40|$|Vacuolar {{myelopathy}} (VM) is {{a frequent}} central nervous system complication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection. We report here that transgenic (Tg) mice expressing even low levels of Nef in <b>oligodendrocytes</b> under the regulation of the myelin basic protein (MBP) promoter (MBP/HIVNef) developed VM similar to the human disease in its appearance and topography. The spinal cords of these Tg mice showed lower levels of the myelin proteins MAG and CNPase and of the 21 -kDa isoform of MBP prior {{to the development of}} vacuoles. In addition, Tg <b>oligodendrocytes</b> in primary in vitro cultures appeared morphologically more mature but, paradoxically, exhibited a less mature phenotype based on O 4, O 1, CNPase, and MBP staining. In particular, mature CNPase+ MBP+ Tg <b>oligodendrocytes</b> were less numerous than non-Tg <b>oligodendrocytes.</b> Therefore, Nef appears to affect the proper differentiation of <b>oligodendrocytes.</b> These data suggest that even low levels of Nef expression in human <b>oligodendrocytes</b> may be responsible for the development of VM in HIV- 1 -infected individuals...|$|R
25|$|Unlike {{peripheral}} {{nervous system}} injury, injury to {{the central nervous system}} is not followed by extensive regeneration. It is limited by the inhibitory influences of the glial and extracellular environment. The hostile, non-permissive growth environment is, in part, created by the migration of myelin-associated inhibitors, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, <b>oligodendrocyte</b> precursors, and microglia. The environment within the CNS, especially following trauma, counteracts the repair of myelin and neurons. Growth factors are not expressed or re-expressed; for instance, the extracellular matrix is lacking laminins. Glial scars rapidly form, and the glia actually produce factors that inhibit remyelination and axon repair; for instance, NOGO and NI-35. The axons themselves also lose the potential for growth with age, due to a decrease in GAP 43 expression.|$|E
25|$|Glia {{retain the}} ability to undergo cell {{division}} in adulthood, whereas most neurons cannot. The view {{is based on the}} general deficiency of the mature nervous system in replacing neurons after an injury, such as a stroke or trauma, while very often there is a profound proliferation of glia, or gliosis near or at the site of damage. However, detailed studies found no evidence that 'mature' glia, such as astrocytes or oligodendrocytes, retain the ability of mitosis. Only the resident <b>oligodendrocyte</b> precursor cells seem to keep this ability after the nervous system matures. On the other hand, there are a few regions in the mature nervous system, such as the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone, where generation of new neurons can be observed.|$|E
25|$|Following {{injury to}} the central nervous system, NG2 expressing <b>oligodendrocyte</b> {{precursor}} cells are seen around the site of injury within 48 hours of the initial injury. The number of NG2 expressing cells continues to increase {{for the next three}} to five days and high levels of NG2 are seen within seven–ten days of the injury. In vitro studies have been done to demonstrate the effect that NG2 levels play on neurite growth inhibition. Notably, neurons would not adhere to substrates made solely of NG2, which hints at its inhibitory effects on nerve regeneration. When grown on substrates containing both NG2 and adhesive molecules, neurite extension was shown to be reduced by 40-45% when compared to neurite extension on substrates only containing the adhesive molecules. Furthermore, cultures were created with striped surfaces that alternated NG2 lanes with lanes only containing adhesive molecules. Neurons and axons placed on these striped regions consistently stayed in the lanes without NG2. It is clear, then, that the accumulation of NG2 expressing cells at the site of injury creates an extracellular barrier that inhibits axon regrowth into the glial scar area.|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of axons {{in the central}} nervous system (CNS) are eventually myelinated by <b>oligodendrocytes,</b> but whether the timing and extent of myelination in vivo reflect intrinsic properties of <b>oligodendrocytes,</b> or are regulated by axons, remains undetermined. Here, we use zebrafish to study CNS myelination at single-cell resolution in vivo. We show that the large caliber Mauthner axon is the first to be myelinated (shortly before axons of smaller caliber) and that the presence of supernumerary large caliber Mauthner axons can profoundly affect myelination by single <b>oligodendrocytes.</b> <b>Oligodendrocytes</b> that typically myelinate just one Mauthner axon in wild type can myelinate multiple supernumerary Mauthner axons. Furthermore, <b>oligodendrocytes</b> that exclusively myelinate numerous smaller caliber axons in wild type can readily myelinate small caliber axons in addition to the much larger caliber supernumerary Mauthner axons. These data indicate that single <b>oligodendrocytes</b> can myelinate diverse axons and that their myelinating potential is actively regulated by individual axons...|$|R

40|$|Remyelination {{occurs in}} {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS) lesions but {{is generally considered}} to be insufficient. One of the major challenges in MS research is to understand the causes of remyelination failure and to identify therapeutic targets that promote remyelination. Activation of pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) signaling in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress modulates cell viability and function under stressful conditions. There is evidence that PERK is activated in remyelinating <b>oligodendrocytes</b> in demyelinated lesions in both MS and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this study, we sought to determine the role of PERK signaling in remyelinating <b>oligodendrocytes</b> in MS and EAE using transgenic mice that allow temporally controlled activation of PERK signaling specifically in <b>oligodendrocytes.</b> We demonstrated that persistent PERK activation was not deleterious to myelinating <b>oligodendrocytes</b> in young, developing mice or to remyelinating <b>oligodendrocytes</b> in cuprizone-induced demyelinated lesions. We found that enhancing PERK activation, specifically in (re) myelinating <b>oligodendrocytes,</b> protected the cells and myelin against the detrimental effects of interferon-γ, a key proinflammatory cytokine in MS and EAE. More important, we showed that enhancing PERK activation in remyelinating <b>oligodendrocytes</b> at the recovery stage of EAE promoted cell survival and remyelination in EAE demyelinated lesions. Thus, our data provide direct evidence that PERK activation cell-autonomously enhances the survival and preserves function of remyelinating <b>oligodendrocytes</b> in immune-mediated demyelinating diseases...|$|R

2500|$|As stated above, {{sulfatide}} {{is predominantly}} {{found in the}} oligodendrocytes and the Schwann cells in the nervous system. When oligodendrocytes are differentiating, sulfatide is first evident in immature oligodendrocytes. [...] However, research suggests that sulfatide has a greater role than simply being a structural component of the membrane. This is because sulfatide is upregulated, i.e.there {{is an increase in}} sulfatide, prior to the myelin sheath being wrapped around the axon, and experiments in cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST) deficient mice have shown that sulfatide operates as a negative regulator (inhibitor) of <b>oligodendrocyte</b> differentiation. Accordingly, further research has demonstrated that when sulfatide is deficient, there is a two to threefold increase in <b>oligodendrocyte</b> differentiation, evidence providing support that sulfatide operates as a negative regulator or inhibitor of <b>oligodendrocyte</b> differentiation. Myelination also appears to be stimulated by sulfatide in the Schwann Cells. Such stimulation is thought to occur through the following interactions. First, sulfatide binds to tenascin-R or laminin in the extracellular matrix, which goes on to bind signaling molecules such as F3 and integrins in the glial membrane. This causes signaling through c-src/fyn kinase. Specifically, the laminin α6β1-integrin forms a complex with fyn kinase and focal adhesion kinase that enables signaling, which, in turn, causes myelination to begin. Sulfatide binding to laminin also causes c-src/fyn kinase activation and initiation of basement membrane formation.|$|E
