40|$|In {{the field}} of {{advanced}} separation <b>of</b> <b>concerns,</b> most researches focus on programming levels. On the other hand, many analysis/design techniques utilize separation <b>of</b> <b>concerns,</b> as {{it is one of}} the common techniques in the software engineering field. Though the utilization <b>of</b> these <b>concerns</b> is slightly different from that in programming level techniques dealing with advanced separation <b>of</b> <b>concerns,</b> it is important to recognize what kinds <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> are used in the analysis/design field, and to clarify the current issues. In this paper, we analyze the concerns in the analysis/design field, observe the current status <b>of</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>concerns,</b> and discuss issues and future research directions. 1. CONCERNS IN ANALYSIS/DESIGN TECHNIQUES Separation <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> is one <b>of</b> the basic techniques in software engineering fields, and many analysis/design techniques apply the technique. Though their utilization <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> is not as same as that of advanced separation <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> [2][3], it is important to analyze the existing concerns and clarify the difference for further researches. The followings are listings <b>of</b> typical <b>concerns</b> used in the analysis/design techniques...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{techniques}} {{have been proposed}} to achieve a better separation <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> in programming systems.

This paper proposes a set of challenge problems for separation <b>of</b> <b>concerns,</b> each <b>of</b> which deals with different types or dimensions <b>of</b> <b>concerns.</b> Drawing from my experience with large, high-level object-oriented systems and from the separation <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> literature, this paper classifies separation <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> problems {{into a number of}} categories and chooses representative examples from each. I intend to continue this work by evaluating a range of current systems using these problems as benchmarks, and then using this experience to design better support for separation <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> in the context of high-level object-oriented languages like Cecil. 1 Challenge Problems Challenge problems have long been useful in evaluating program design and implemen [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|On 16 January 2017, the DUP {{launched}} a petition <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> in the Assembly {{to protect the}} Speaker from Sinn Féin's {{motion of no confidence}}. 30 MLAs are required to sign a petition <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> and, when a petition <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> is deployed, any votes taken are subject to a cross-community vote. As the DUP hold the majority of unionist seats, they effectively blocked the motion from passing.

3000|$|With {{the current}} knowledge, short-chain PFASs {{seem not to}} fulfill the {{bioaccumulation}} or toxicity criteria of REACH Annex XIII. Due to the special properties of short-chain PFASs, they might not fulfill the “classical” properties <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>of</b> SVHCs, being clearly defined within Article 57 (d and e) of the REACH Regulation. However, given the properties <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> (see “Overview <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> short-chain PFAAs”) and the already existing pollutions (see “Case example Rastatt”), there is an unequivocal need for regulation of short-chain PFASs. Within the REACH Regulation, {{it is possible to}} identify substances as SVHC that have an equivalent level <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> compared to CMR or PBT/vPvB substances, as defined in article 57 (f) (see “Strategy for regulation of short-chain PFASs under REACH”). So far, the equivalent level <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> approach is applied for endocrine disrupting chemicals, sensitisers and specific target organ toxicity after repeated exposure only.
