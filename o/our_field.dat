500|$|Ultima Underworld uses {{two-dimensional}} sprites for characters, {{but also}} features 3D objects, {{as the team}} believed that it [...] "had to do 3D objects {{in order to have}} reasonable visuals". The game uses physics to calculate the motion of thrown objects. During the game's alpha testing phase, part of the programming team worked to create a smooth lighting model. The game's advanced technology caused the engine to run slowly, and its system requirements were extremely high. Doug Church later downplayed the importance of the game's technology, stating that technological advancement [...] "is somewhat inevitable in <b>our</b> <b>field</b> ... sadly, as an industry we seem to know much less about design, and how to continue to extend and grow design capabilities". Instead, he claimed that Ultima Underworlds most important achievement was its incorporation of simulation elements into a role-playing game.|$|E

[...] He was a processual archaeologist who championed the necessity of experimental archaeology and hypothesis testing in the exploration of human cultural ecology. [...] By adopting, creating or championing methods that made archaeological results more generalizable and amenable to hypothesis testing MacNeish was attempting to learn, and teach, about the broader patterns of social change that can inform our choices in the future; he wished to use archaeology to improve the human condition. [...] “…laws of cultural change may be of use not only in explaining the past, but more important, in predicting the future or at least indicating the steps in cultural change we might take in the future”. [...] His ultimate legacy, {{the sum total of}} all of his individual accomplishments in methodology and theory, was his commitment to archaeology as a science that could produce laws and theories to aid humanity in the future.

2500|$|At the Hungarian {{left wing}} the Hungarian advance, {{covered by the}} cannons from the fortress, was stopped by the enemy cavalry, and pushed back to the {{so-called}} Star Fort of Komárom. The retreating Liebler-brigade was pursued towards Nagyigmánd by two regiments of the Hungarian hussars led by Major General József Nagysándor, supported by the 47th battalion and a 12-pound battery, but they were attacked from two sides by 4 enemy heavy cavalry regiments, which put the Hungarian cavalry in the danger of being obliterated, but {{the resistance of the}} infantry battalion, which entered quickly in a square formation, stopped the imperial cavalry. The Hungarian infantry from the Hungarian left wing retreated in square formations while shooting towards the center led by Damjanich. The 26th Hungarian battalion with a bayonet attack, forced the imperial heavy cavalry to retreat, saving the 47th battalion from a difficult situation, and holding until Damjanich sent the Ferdinánd Hussars to help them. With this on the left wing the Hungarians managed to hold the powerful imperial advance, so the battle here continued with artillery duel, until they run out of cannonballs. One of the adjutants of the Hungarian headquarters, Kálmán Rochlitz, wrote in his memoirs: <b>Our</b> <b>field</b> artillery run out of ammunition in such a way that, when I went to one of the batteries of the I. corps, I saw with my own eyes, that our artillerymen picked up from the ground the cannon balls fired at us , wrapped them in the rags, made of the clothes ripped from the dead bodies of the fallen , and in this way they put them in the cannon tubes, on the blank gunpowder, they put in them [...] before.|$|E
