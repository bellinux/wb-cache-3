5|$|A serious {{accident}} occurred on 28 April 1980, when a three-coach train carrying 80 passengers from Dalmuir to Motherwell derailed at Hyndland West Junction, just after leaving Jordanhill. All the bogies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> coach left the rails, causing fifteen people (nine women and six men) {{to be injured}} seriously {{enough for them to}} be taken to the Western Infirmary.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{themselves}} {{now have}} more sophisticated deicing systems {{that can be}} used on the ground and in the air. Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use anti-ice systems <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> edge of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above freezing, preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions.|$|E

5|$|Among Uranus's moons, Titania is {{intermediate}} {{in brightness}} between the dark Oberon and Umbriel {{and the bright}} Ariel and Miranda. Its surface shows a strong opposition surge: its reflectivity decreases from 35% at a phase angle of 0° (geometrical albedo) to 25% at an angle of about 1°. Titania has a relatively low Bond albedo of about 17%. Its surface is generally slightly red in color, but less red than that of Oberon. However, fresh impact deposits are bluer, while the smooth plains situated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> hemisphere near Ursula crater and along some grabens are somewhat redder. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the former appears to be redder than the latter by 8%. However, this difference {{is related to the}} smooth plains and may be accidental. The reddening of the surfaces probably results from space weathering caused by bombardment by charged particles and micrometeorites over the age of the Solar System. However, the color asymmetry of Titania is more likely related to accretion of a reddish material coming from outer parts of the Uranian system, possibly, from irregular satellites, which would be deposited predominately <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|In {{the very}} last leg, the {{starting}} order of teams switches {{to that of the}} points tally going in; the athlete <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> team jumps last. The winning team is the one with the most points {{at the end of the}} competition, after which the top three final teams (or more in the event of a tie) participate in a podium ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Oberon is {{the second}} largest and most massive of the Uranian moons after Titania, and the ninth most massive moon in the Solar System. Oberon's density of 1.63g/cm³, which {{is higher than the}} typical density of Saturn's satellites, {{indicates}} that it consists of roughly equal proportions of water ice and a dense non-ice component. The latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds. The presence of water ice is supported by spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of the}} moon. Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Oberon's trailing hemisphere than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> hemisphere. This is the opposite of what is observed on other Uranian moons, where the leading hemisphere exhibits stronger water ice signatures. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to impact gardening (the creation of soil via impacts) of the surface, which is stronger <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> hemisphere. Meteorite impacts tend to sputter (knock out) ice from the surface, leaving dark non-ice material behind. The dark material itself may have formed as a result of radiation processing of methane clathrates or radiation darkening of other organic compounds.|$|E

5|$|Other {{designs of}} the mid-H series {{included}} the He 111 H-7 and H-8. The airframes {{were to be}} rebuilds of the H-3/H-5 variant. Both were designed as night bombers and were to have two Jumo 211F-1s installed. The intention was for the H-8 to be fitted with cable-cutting equipment and barrage ballon deflectors <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> edge of the wings. The H-7 was never built.|$|E
5|$|The few impact craters on Triton {{are almost}} all {{concentrated}} in the leading hemisphere—that facing {{the direction of the}} orbital motion—with the majority concentrated around the equator between 30° and 70° longitude, resulting from material swept up from orbit around Neptune. Because it orbits with one side permanently facing the planet, astronomers expect that Triton should have fewer impacts on its trailing hemisphere, due to impacts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> hemisphere being more frequent and more violent. Voyager 2 imaged only 40% of Triton's surface, so this remains uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the dark patches, which mainly occur <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> {{hemisphere}} and inside craters, is not known. Some scientists hypothesized that they are of cryovolcanic origin (analogs of lunar maria), while others think that the impacts excavated dark material buried beneath the pure ice (crust). In the latter case Oberon {{should be at least}} partially differentiated, with the ice crust lying atop the non-differentiated interior.|$|E

5|$|The {{surface of}} Metis is heavily cratered, dark, {{and appears to}} be reddish in color. There is a {{substantial}} asymmetry between leading and trailing hemispheres: the leading hemisphere is 1.3 times brighter than the trailing one. The asymmetry is probably caused by the higher velocity and frequency of impacts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> hemisphere, which excavate a bright material (presumably ice) from its interior.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} Thebe {{is dark and}} appears to be reddish in color. There is a {{substantial}} asymmetry between leading and trailing hemispheres: the leading hemisphere is 1.3times brighter than the trailing one. The asymmetry is probably caused by the higher velocity and frequency of impacts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> hemisphere, which excavate a bright material (probably ice) from the interior of the moon. The surface of Thebe is heavily cratered and it appears that {{there are at least three}} or four impact craters that are very large, each being roughly comparable in size to Thebe itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{tawny owl}} flies with long glides on rounded wings, less undulating and with fewer wingbeats than other Eurasian owls, and {{typically}} at a greater height. The {{flight of the}} tawny owl is rather heavy and slow, particularly at takeoff. As with most owls, its flight is silent because of its feathers' soft, furry upper surfaces and a fringe <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> edge of the outer primaries. Its size, squat shape and broad wings distinguish it from other owls found within its range; great grey, eagle and Ural owls are similar in shape, but much larger.|$|E

5|$|A {{battle for}} the lead {{developed}} between Hamilton and Ricciardo, until the Australian moved around Hamilton on lap 15. With {{the grip of the}} intermediate tyres deteriorating, there were many overtaking manoeuvres on track. Rosberg unsuccessfully tried to overtake teammate Hamilton for second on lap 16, while Verstappen took sixth place from Vettel one lap later, only to run wide and lose the position again. On lap 18, Rosberg moved ahead of Hamilton, who {{was the first of the}} front runners to change tyres at the end of the lap, going for a dry compound. The other frontrunners followed suit over the next couple of laps. Following the pit stops, Ricciardo led from Rosberg, Kvyat and Hamilton. The two Mercedes drivers moved ahead of their respective Red Bull rivals on laps 22 and 23, while Vettel, now in fifth, closed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> quartet. On lap 24, he reached Kvyat and overtook him for fourth, while Nico Rosberg extended his lead to Ricciardo to nine seconds by lap 25. Hamilton took second place from Ricciardo one lap later. At the same time, Kimi Räikkönen was forced to retire. So had Massa on lap 24, suffering the same problem that had forced his teammate to stop.|$|E
5|$|Although Mouton {{competed in}} only one world {{championship}} event during the season, she contested a full six-round British Rally Championship. Her campaign was plagued by reliability problems and she recorded only one finish. In the National Breakdown Rally, Mouton stopped after damaging her Quattro in a jump. After technical problems led to an early retirement at the Circuit of Ireland, she finished second at the Welsh Rally behind Malcolm Wilson in another Quattro. At the Scottish Rally, Mouton had been closing in <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> Wilson until a transmission problem forced her to retire. At the Ulster Rally, she set the fastest time for the first stage but then dropped out with a mechanical failure. In the season-ending Manx International Rally, Mouton struggled to start her Quattro and then crashed out five stages later.|$|E

5|$|At 05:00 {{the leading}} British ship, HMS Monarch, was within range {{and opened fire}} on the French squadron, which divided. One frigate went north and was intercepted by HMS Mars, while another, {{accompanied}} by the two corvettes, turned south and managed to outrun HMS Windsor Castle. The {{main body of the}} French force remained together and met the attack of Monarch and the British flagship HMS Centaur with their broadsides. Although outnumbered and outclassed by the British squadron the French ships fought hard, inflicting damage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> British ships and severely wounding Commodore Hood. Eventually the strength of the British squadron told, and despite a fierce resistance the French ships surrendered one by one, the British capturing four of the seven vessels in the squadron.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, more {{administrative}} {{records from}} the period had become available to historians such as William Stubbs, Thomas Tout and J. C. Davies, who focused {{on the development of the}} English constitutional and governmental system during his reign. Although critical of what they regarded as Edward's inadequacies as a king, they also emphasised the growth of the role of parliament and the reduction in personal royal authority under Edward II, which they perceived as positive developments. During the 1970s the historiography of Edward's reign shifted away from this model, supported by the further publishing of records from the period in the last quarter of the 20th century. The work of Jeffrey Denton, Jeffrey Hamilton, John Maddicott and Seymour Phillips re-focused attention on the role of the individual leaders in the conflicts. With the exceptions of Hilda Johnstone's work on Edward's early years, and Natalie Fryde's study of Edward's final years, the focus of the major historical studies for several years was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> magnates rather than Edward himself, until substantial biographies of the King were published by Roy Haines and Seymour Phillips in 2003 and 2011.|$|E
5|$|Charged {{particles}} have {{a considerable}} {{influence on the}} surface properties of Galilean moons. Plasma originating from Io carries sulfur and sodium ions farther from the planet, where they are implanted preferentially on the trailing hemispheres of Europa and Ganymede. On Callisto however, for unknown reasons, sulfur is concentrated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> hemisphere. Plasma may also be responsible for darkening the moons' trailing hemispheres (again, except Callisto's). Energetic electrons and ions, with the flux of the latter being more isotropic, bombard surface ice, sputtering atoms and molecules off and causing radiolysis of water and other chemical compounds. The energetic particles break water into oxygen and hydrogen, maintaining the thin oxygen atmospheres of the icy moons (since the hydrogen escapes more rapidly). The compounds produced radiolytically on the surfaces of Galilean moons also include ozone and hydrogen peroxide. If organics or carbonates are present, carbon dioxide, methanol and carbonic acid can be produced as well. In the presence of sulfur, likely products include sulfur dioxide, hydrogen disulfide and sulfuric acid. Oxidants produced by radiolysis, like oxygen and ozone, may be trapped inside the ice and carried downward to the oceans over geologic time intervals, thus serving as a possible energy source for life.|$|E
