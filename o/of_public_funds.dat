5|$|Even {{prior to}} the cost {{increases}} which plagued the design and construction of the tram, the project has been subject to criticism from the public.

5|$|In {{a letter}} dated 12 June 1842 in the Colonial Secretary's Records, Marshall Clifton, Chief Commissioner of the Western Australian Land Company, {{wrote of the}} need for an {{improved}} Perth–Fremantle–Bunbury road. On a special trip he took in the previous October to look for a new route, two surveyors gave their approval to the proposed coastal route, with a ferry across the estuary. Governor John Hutt approved of the idea of a road, but thought a ferry would be impractical, at least during winter, and that the lack <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funds</b> made it impossible. Clifton continued to write letters to the Colonial Secretary advocating the construction of a road.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} inaugural speech in August 1816, Jennings called {{attention}} to the need for an educational plan. In his 1817 annual message to the state legislature, he encouraged the establishment of a free, state-funded education system, as called for in the state constitution, but few of the state's citizens were willing to impose taxes to fund public schools. The state legislature believed priority should be given to creating government infrastructure. Lack <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funds</b> postponed creation of a state library system until Governor James B. Ray's administration in 1826.|$|E
5|$|Of the film's net profit, {{estimated}} to amount to $30–40million (£20–25million) from the cinema release alone, roughly 20% will be split between Geoffrey Rush (as executive producer), Tom Hooper and Colin Firth, who receive their bonuses {{before the other}} stakeholders. The remaining profit is to be split equally between the producers and the equity investors. The UK Film Council invested £1million <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funds</b> from the United Kingdom lottery into the film.

5|$|This attack, {{and similar}} attacks {{carried out by}} the GAL, became a major issue during the 1996 Spanish general {{election}} after a Supreme court trial established that the Spanish Interior Ministry had provided clandestine funding for the GAL. Spanish Interior Minister José Barrionuevo and his security chief, Rafael Vera, were jailed for ten years for sanctioning a kidnapping and misappropriation <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funds</b> to finance the group, and the GAL scandal is seen as a key factor in the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) losing the election, though more senior figures in the PSOE, such as Felipe Gonzalez, denied knowledge and involvement.|$|E
5|$|As the Monbar {{case and}} similar cases came to light, the GAL issue became {{increasingly}} controversial in the 1990s, with questions over whether {{members of the}} Spanish government and state security service had known about the group's operations in places like Bayonne and, if so, to what extent they had supported and funded the attacks. This became a major issue during the 1996 Spanish general election with Spanish Interior Minister, José Barrionuevo, and his security chief, Rafael Vera, implicated in the GAL case. In 1998, both were jailed for ten years for sanctioning a kidnapping and misappropriation <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funds</b> to finance the GAL. Along with various corruption scandals and the poor state of the Spanish economy in the mid-1990s, the GAL scandal {{is seen as a}} key factor in the PSOE defeat.|$|E

The data set for this analysis is taken from the Community Innovation Survey which allows us to compare the results obtained with results obtained for other countries. For reasons discussed in the study the Finnish results are checked against results obtained for analyses of the Community Innovation Survey in Germany. Concerning the overall effects <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> in Finland we can draw quite positive conclusions based on our empirical analysis: First, on average, <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> increases the private innovation effort of funded firms, in both nominal and real terms. Second, on average, <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> increases the innovation output <b>of</b> <b>funded</b> firms. <b>Public</b> <b>funding</b> yields the largest effects when it stimulating collaborative innovation activities.

5|$|Currently, Wales {{play all}} their home matches at the 74,500 {{capacity}} Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, {{which is also}} Wales' national stadium. The Millennium Stadium was first conceived in 1994, when a group redevelopment committee was set up. It was decided to replace the National Stadium at Cardiff Arms Park after a review found {{it was out of}} date; new legislation also required stadia to be all seated. Construction began in September 1997, and was completed by June 1999, in time for the Rugby World Cup. The construction cost the WRU £126million, which was funded by private investment, £46million <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funds</b> from the National Lottery, the sale of debentures to supporters (which offered guaranteed tickets in exchange for an interest-free loan), and loans. While the new ground was being built, Wales used the old Wembley Stadium for their home matchesa deal reciprocated during construction of the new Wembley, when FA Cup finals were held at the Millennium Stadium.|$|E
5|$|The {{detailed}} {{investigation into}} corruption that St Vincent began {{caused him to}} become extremely unpopular as many influential men {{were involved in the}} various money making schemes perpetrated. The board of inquiry set up by St Vincent was responsible for the impeachment of Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville and his trial for misappropriation <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funds.</b> St Vincent had made an enemy of Pitt and Pitt used the naval reform and its unpopularity to attack the First Lord and the Addington administration. St Vincent left the office on 14 May 1804 when Addington was replaced as Prime Minister by Pitt. Lord Howick, second son of St Vincent's friend Sir Charles Grey came to his defence and with the assistance of Charles James Fox moved for a vote of thanks in the Commons for St Vincent's tireless efforts in naval reform in 1806.|$|E
5|$|A major {{report was}} {{published}} in January 1998 by The New York Times detailing Zardari's vast corruption and misuse <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funds.</b> The report discussed $200 million in kickbacks to Zardari and a Pakistani partner for a $4 billion contract with French military contractor Dassault Aviation, in a deal that fell apart only when the Bhutto government was dismissed. It contained details of two payments of $5 million each by a gold bullion dealer {{in return for a}} monopoly on gold imports. It had information from Pakistani investigators that the Bhutto family had allegedly accrued more than $1.5 billion in illicit profits through kickbacks in virtually every sphere of government activity. It also reported Zardari's mid-1990s spending spree, which included {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} spent on jewellery. The arrangements made by the Bhutto family for their wealth relied on Western property companies, Western lawyers, and a network of Western friends. The report described how Zardari had arranged secret contracts, painstaking negotiations, and the dismissal of anyone who objected to his dealings.|$|E

5|$|Aediles were {{officers}} {{elected to}} conduct domestic affairs in Rome, and often assisted the higher magistrates. The office {{was not on}} the cursus honorum, and therefore did not mark the beginning of a political career. Every year, two curule aediles and two plebeian aediles were elected. The Tribal Assembly, while under the presidency of a higher magistrate (either a consul or praetor), elected the two curule aediles. While they had a curule chair, they did not have lictors, and thus they had no power of coercion. The Plebeian Council (principal popular assembly), under the presidency of a plebeian tribune, elected the two plebeian aediles. Aediles had wide-ranging powers over day-to-day affairs inside the city of Rome, and over the maintenance of public order. They had the power over public games and shows, and over the markets. They also had the power to repair and preserve temples, sewers and aqueducts, to maintain public records, and to issue edicts. Any expenditure <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funds,</b> by either a curule aedile or a plebeian aedile, had to be authorized by the senate.|$|E
5|$|At {{least in}} part resentful of the French king's {{previous}} support of his Lancastrian opponents, and possibly {{in support of his}} brother-in-law Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, Edward went to parliament in October 1472 for funding a military campaign, and eventually landed in Calais on 4 July 1475. Richard's was the largest private contingent of his army. Although well known to have publicly been against the eventual treaty signed with Louis XI at Picquigny (and absent from the negotiations, in which one of his rank would have been expected to take a leading role), he acted as Edward's witness when the king instructed his delegates to the French court, and received 'some very fine presents' from Louis on a visit to the French king at Amiens. In refusing other gifts, which included 'pensions' in the guise of 'tribute', he was joined only by Cardinal Bourchier. He supposedly disapproved of Edward's policy of personally benefitting—politically and financially—from a campaign paid for out of a parliamentary grant, and hence out <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funds.</b> Any military prowess was therefore not to be revealed further until the last years of Edward's reign.|$|E
5|$|Preckwinkle {{chairs the}} ward organization, the Fourth Ward Democratic Organization, {{which was one}} of sixteen Chicago Democratic ward {{organizations}} named in a complaint filed on August 31, 2005 with the Illinois State Board of Elections by the Cook County Republican Party charging that Democratic Party ward organizations are illegally housed in City-funded neighborhood ward offices. Taxpayers fund aldermanic service centers, which are open to the public. State law prohibits the use <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funds</b> by any candidate for political or campaign purposes. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of nine that a Hearing Officer appointed by the Board recommended proceed to the next step of the hearing process, an Open Preliminary Hearing. On October 17, 2005, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Elections, the Board entered an executive session and voted, in a 4–4 tie, along strict party lines, failing to adopt the recommendation of the Hearing Officer, and ordered the complaints dismissed. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of eight that the Cook County Republican Party appealed {{all the way to the}} Supreme Court of Illinois. On January 23, 2009, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously ordered the Illinois appellate court to conduct a judicial review of the Board's dismissals of the complaints.|$|E
