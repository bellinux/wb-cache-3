50|$|Because the {{molecular}} weights of 235UF6 and 238UF6 are nearly equal, very little {{separation of the}} 235U and 238U is effected by a single pass through a barrier, that is, in one diffuser.

Such a sequence <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> is called a cascade. In practice, diffusion cascades require thousands <b>of</b> <b>stages,</b> depending on the desired level of enrichment.|$|R

30|$|There is {{a strong}} {{relationship}} between the number <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> a voltage multiplier and its sensitivity and efficiency. As the number <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> increase, there is more loss across each added stage. However, the tradeoff is higher voltage multiplication and small threshold voltage at the first stage. On the other hand, a voltage multiplier with a few stages has less voltage drop between its stages but requires higher threshold voltage for all stages to work simultaneously. For this reason, a voltage multiplier becomes more sensitive when a large number <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> are present and becomes more efficient at fewer stages. This tradeoff feature was analyzed in several researches [53, 58]. Therefore, the optimal number <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> should be considered depending upon the application targets.|$|R

5|$|A record exists of a {{performance}} of The Tempest on 1 November 1611 by the King's Men before James I and the English royal court at Whitehall Palace on Hallowmas night.

There is no further public performance recorded prior to the Restoration; but in his 1669 preface to the Dryden/Davenant version, John Dryden states that The Tempest had been performed at the Blackfriars Theatre. Careful consideration <b>of</b> <b>stage</b> directions within the play supports this, strongly suggesting that the play was written with Blackfriars Theatre rather than the Globe Theatre in mind.|$|E
