He and former PayPal colleague, Russel Simmons, who was also working at MRL Ventures, began brainstorming on how to create an <b>online</b> <b>community</b> where users could share recommendations for local services. Stoppelman and Simmons pitched the idea to Levchin who provided $1 million in initial funding. Under Stoppelman's leadership, Yelp grew to a market capitalization of $4 billion and hosted 138 million user reviews.|$|E
5|$|For some, {{being a part}} of a {{community}} is an important resource because they often report having felt ostracized. Although online communities exist, affiliation with online communities vary. Some question the concept of <b>online</b> <b>community,</b> while others depend on the online asexual community heavily for support. Elizabeth Abbott posits that there has always been an asexual element in the population, but that asexual people kept a low profile. While the failure to consummate marriage was seen as an insult to the sacrament of marriage in medieval Europe, and has sometimes been used as grounds for divorce or to rule a marriage void, asexuality, unlike homosexuality, has never been illegal, and it has usually gone unnoticed. However, in the 21st century, the anonymity of online communication and general popularity of social networking online has facilitated the formation of {{a community}} built around a common asexual identity.|$|E
5|$|In early 2006, Sony {{released}} {{a remake of}} Lemmings for the PlayStation Portable, developed by Team17. It features all 120 levels from the original game, 36 brand-new levels as well as DataPack support (similar to the Extra Track system featured in Wipeout Pure), and a user-level editor. Every level in the game is a pre-rendered 3D landscape, although their gameplay is still 2D and remains faithful to the original game. User levels can be constructed from pre-rendered objects and distributed by uploading them to a PlayStation-specific Lemmings <b>online</b> <b>community.</b> The soundtrack also marks the final video game score created by longtime composer Tim Follin after he announced his retirement from the industry in mid-2005. In October 2006 the game was ported by developer Rusty Nutz for the PlayStation 2 with use of the EyeToy. The basic change in the concept is that the player must stretch and use his/her limbs in the recorded picture to aid the lemmings. In 2007, Team17 produced a similar remake of Lemmings for the PlayStation 3 for download through the PlayStation Network. The game has the similar graphical improvements as the PSP title, as well as on-line scoreboards and additional levels developed for high-definition display, but lacks {{the ability to create}} and share levels as the PSP version offers. Another remake, Lemmings Touch, was released for PlayStation Vita on 27 May 2014, developed by d3t Ltd.|$|E
40|$|Organizations are {{exploring}} the role communities play in knowledge management and <b>online</b> <b>communities</b> are attracting {{more and more}} attentions.

5|$|On 9 August 2007, an Odex {{representative}} said it {{intended to}} obtain search warrants for illegally downloaded anime if necessary. The company initially believed that, unlike in other countries, mere warning letters {{would not stop}} the downloads in Singapore. Letters were sent mainly to people who had downloaded more popular series, such as Bleach, D.Gray-man, Fullmetal Alchemist and InuYasha. There was speculation from the <b>online</b> <b>community</b> that the company would collect approximately S$15million from 3,000 individuals from out-of-court settlements, but Odex responded {{that it did not}} require each of them to pay a uniform S$5,000. The main factor it considered when deciding the level of compensation to demand was the amount of downloading by each individual. Odex confirmed that more than 3,000 IP addresses had been disclosed {{as a result of the}} court orders, but estimated that the amount collected would cover less than 20% of its enforcement costs. The company's director, Peter Go, subsequently revealed that most of the compensation payments had been paid to BayTSP and to ISPs for the retrieval of their subscribers' personal data. He justified his company's actions by stating that, according to BayTSP's statistics, Singapore had one of the highest rates of illegal anime downloads in the world and that Odex wanted to reduce this by 85%.|$|E

40|$|<b>Online</b> <b>communities</b> play an {{important}} role in society. In this paper, we study the effects of membership overlap on the survival of <b>online</b> <b>communities.</b> By analyzing the historical data of 5673 Wikia communities, we find that higher levels of membership overlap are positively associated with greater survival rate of <b>online</b> <b>communities</b> relative to lower levels of membership overlap. Furthermore, we find that it is beneficial for new communities to have shared members who play a central role in other mature communities. These findings provide new insight into {{an important}} mechanism underlying successful <b>online</b> <b>communities,</b> contribute to theories of organization science, and provide several actionable steps for the hosts and creators of <b>online</b> <b>communities...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Online</b> <b>{{communities}}</b> {{and communities}} of practice {{bring people together}} to promote and support shared goals and exchange information. Personal interactions are important to many of these communities {{and one of the}} important outcomes of personal interactions in <b>online</b> <b>communities</b> and communities of practice is user-generated content. The three essays in the current study examines behavior motivation in <b>online</b> <b>communities</b> and communities of practice to understand how Social and personal psychological factors, and user-generated influence attitudes, intentions and behaviors in <b>online</b> <b>communities.</b> The first essay addresses two research questions. First, how does Social capital influence exchange and combination behaviors in <b>online</b> <b>communities</b> of practice? Second, how does absorptive capacity moderate the impact of exchange and combination behaviors on individual and community performance outcomes? Using a sample of 187 participants recruited from <b>online</b> <b>communities</b> of practice, {{the results of this study}} support the hypothesized relations between Social capital, and exchange and combination behaviors. Additionally, the moderating role of absorptive capacity is also supported. The second essay draws on Social identity and personal motivation theories to examine the following research questions. First, how do Social identity, and extrinsic and intrinsic motivations influence knowledge seeking and sharing behaviors in <b>online</b> <b>communities?</b> Second, how do knowledge seeking and sharing behaviors affect satisfaction with a community? Third, how do extrinsic and intrinsic motivations moderate the outcomes of knowledge seeking and sharing behaviors? To answers these research questions, a sample of 152 participants were recruited from a number of <b>online</b> <b>communities.</b> The results of this study indicate that intrinsic and extrinsic motivations are significant predictors of knowledge seeking and sharing behaviors in <b>online</b> <b>communities,</b> and these behaviors also have a positive impact on satisfaction. Only one of the dimensions of Social identity has a positive impact on knowledge seeking and sharing behaviors in <b>online</b> <b>communities.</b> Using the theoretical lenses of elaboration likelihood model and Social presence, this study investigates two research questions. First, how do Social presence, source credibility, and content quality influence attitudes and intentions towards <b>online</b> <b>communities?</b> Second, how does knowledge affect those relationships? The research questions are investigated in a 2 X 2 X 2 factorial experiment with random assignment of 256 participants to one of the eight <b>online</b> <b>communities.</b> The results support all the hypothesized direct effects; two of the three hypothesized mediated relationships are also supported. The result provides insights into attitude formation, informs research on <b>online</b> <b>communities</b> and user-generated content, and has implications on the management and support of <b>online</b> <b>communities.</b> The results from the three studies inform research on <b>online</b> <b>communities</b> by providing insights into behavior motivations and outcomes, and the role of user-generated content.

Although, some of the commercial and marketing opportunities of <b>online</b> <b>communities</b> have already been studied – like those of brand or consumption <b>communities</b> – <b>online</b> <b>communities</b> can offer many more opportunities to business, including tangible revenues and intangible benefits such as improved image or the co-creation of new products.

40|$|Abstract: Communication and {{engagement}} {{is vital to}} creativity, yet how do differing communication methods influence creativity? This research summarizes a five year study, involving over five hundred participants {{from a range of}} different locations, cultures and ability levels. Comparing <b>online</b> digital <b>communities</b> and the more common face-to-face communities, this project studied how participants engaged in learning, interactions and the development of creative outcomes. Overall the <b>online</b> <b>communities</b> were highly successful in transfer of information, in fact more effective than face-to-face. Despite this, the participants in <b>online</b> <b>communities</b> indicated a sense of detachment and a lack of true community. This demonstrated a key weakness of <b>online</b> <b>communities,</b> yet this sense of detachment also led to a significant amount of risk taking in creative projects. The relative anonymity of <b>online</b> <b>communities</b> led to bolder creative risks being taken and broadly better outcomes being achieved.
