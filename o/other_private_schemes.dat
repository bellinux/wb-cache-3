40|$|The {{reform of}} pension systems is arguably {{one of the}} key {{challenges}} for social policy in Europe in the context of demographic change. In recent years, the issue has been very high on the policy agenda across all EU Member States and in Norway. While several countries have introduced pension reforms over a decade ago, the economic crisis and the ensuing debt crisis have prompted a further wave of reform. These have largely concentrated on the sustainability of public pensions and on increasing the effective retirement age, with some changes proving very controversial. This report provides an overview of the involvement of social partners in pension reforms adopted since 2008 across the EU 27, as well as in Norway. It focuses particularly on the influences of the social partners on the outcomes of reform processes. This report distinguishes between reforms of statutory ‘pay-as-you go’ pensions and other funded schemes (such as statutory funded schemes, occupational pensions and <b>other</b> <b>private</b> <b>schemes)</b> ...|$|E

The traditional traffic route along the A11 trunk road became a bottleneck as it ran both ways along High Street and Church Street, thus in the 1970s a one-way system was opened channelling traffic around the natural ring road surrounding the church. The volume of traffic continued to increase making that change obsolete so the Attleborough bypass was opened in 1984. The bypass was widened and completed in 2007 removing the only single lane section of the A11 between Thetford and Norwich.|$|R

The current state and the recent development of the Czech <b>private</b> pension <b>scheme</b> are analyzed {{in the first part of}} the paper. In the main part of this work we construct the dataset of periodic scheme returns covering the last decade, and estimate the schemes Sharpe ratios (SR) for four reference benchmarks. The findings suggest that except for Poland none of the schemes managed to beat its long-term domestic benchmark (10 -year government bonds) as the SRs estimates turn out to be negative. The highest underperformance was found in the case of the Czech Republic. Such poor results were assigned to the presence of restrictive annual minimum return guarantees and ineffective legislation arranging the PF costs allocation. <b>Private</b> pension <b>schemes,</b> Czech voluntary pension scheme, financial performance, Sharpe ratio...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{critical}} examination of <b>private</b> certification <b>schemes</b> potential for serving as a non-governmental approach to environmental protection. The in-ternational political climate these days seem to breed fewer and fewer opportu-nities for a unified and global reaction {{to a range of}} environmental issues: from the lapsed negotiations of the 1992 Earth Summit on environment and devel-opment to the feeble action on climate change seen with Kyoto II. The rise of <b>private</b> certification <b>schemes</b> such as the Forest Stewardship Council came as a civil society reaction to the Earth Summit, with the resulting UN General As-sembly s Forest Principles as a guideline, and spearheaded by a range of NGOs and buyer groups. Since then, <b>other</b> <b>private</b> certification <b>schemes</b> have appeared with the aim to set standards for fisheries, fair trade and sugarcane production, amongst others. The discussions surrounding these programmes are many, some of the most prominent ones being what kind of legitimacy they have, to what ex-tent they work or not and their advantages and disadvantages vis-à-vis other forms of regulation. This thesis bases its point of inquiry on the topic of green-wash – an accusation often posed by civil society organisations towards the pri-vate sector s use of green -profile as a PR strategy, and explores the potential of <b>private</b> certification <b>schemes</b> in light of this. To answer the question, the thesis uses the definitions by Underdal (2004) on regime strength as well as the framework by Gulbrandsen (2010) for the dependent variable of strength and applies it to two case studies. It then juxtaposes an ideal type of greenwash with an opposite of global governance, to which the findings in each case study are compared to form the analysis of this thesis...|$|R

In the main part of this work we construct the dataset of periodic scheme returns covering the last decade, and estimate the schemes Sharpe ratios (SR) for four reference benchmarks. To complement the analysis we also employ the Sharpe style analysis to evaluate the impact of managerial decisions of market selection/timing on the scheme returns. The findings suggest that except for Poland none of the schemes managed to beat its long- term domestic benchmark (10 - year government bonds) as the SRs estimates turn out to be negative. The highest underperformance was found in the case of Czech Republic. The results of style analysis suggest a modest positive influence of the active managerial decisions on the scheme returns with respect to the passive investment strategies.

This paper looks at whether people are happy to opt for private solutions, and particularly, how well disposed they are to saving for old age in private, equity-based, funds. It suggests that the experience of poor stock market performance, provider failure, counter-intuitive decisions by regulators and the working of means-testing rules frighten people off voluntary participation in <b>private</b> pension <b>schemes.</b> Whether justified or not, negative experiences can b...|$|R
40|$|Most {{corporate}} {{codes of}} conduct and multi-stakeholder sustainability standards guarantee workers' rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining, but many authors are sceptical about the concrete impact of codes and standards of this kind. In this paper we use Hancher and Moran's (1998) concept of 'regulatory space' to assess the potential of private transnational regulation to support the growth of trade union membership and collective bargaining relationships, drawing on some preliminary case study results from a project {{on the impact of}} the International Finance Corporation's (IFC) social conditionality on worker organization and social dialogue. One of the major effects of neoliberal economic and industrial policy has been the routine exclusion of workers' organizations from regulatory processes {{on the grounds that they}} introduce inappropriate 'political' motives into what ought to be technical decision-making processes. This, rather than any direct attack on their capacity to take action, is what seems best to explain the global decline in union influence (Cradden 2004; Howell 2007; Howe 2012). The evidence we present in the paper suggests that private labour regulation may under certain conditions contribute to a reversal of this tendency, re-establishing the legitimacy of workers' organizations within regulatory processes and by extension the legitimacy of their use of economic and social power. We argue that guarantees of freedom of association and bargaining rights within <b>private</b> regulation <b>schemes</b> are effective to the extent that they can be used by workers' organizations in support of a claim for access to the regulatory space within which the terms and conditions of the employment relationship are determined. Our case study evidence shows that certain trade unions in East Africa have indeed been able to use IFC and <b>other</b> <b>private</b> regulation <b>schemes</b> as levers to win recognition from employers and to establish collective bargaining relationships. Although they did not attempt to use formal procedures to make a claim for the enforcement of freedom of association rights on behalf of their members, the unions did use enterprises' adherence to <b>private</b> regulation <b>schemes</b> as a normative point of reference in argument and political exchange about worker representation. For these unions, the regulation was a useful addition to the range of arguments that they could deploy as means to justify their demand for recognition by employers. By contrast, the private regulation that helps workers' organizations to win access to regulatory processes does little to ensure that they are able to participate meaningfully, whether in terms of technical capacity or of their ability to mobilize social power as a counterweight to the economic power of employers. To the extent that our East African unions were able to make an impact on terms and conditions of employment via their participation in regulatory space it was solely on the basis of their own capacities and resources and the application of national labour law...|$|R
