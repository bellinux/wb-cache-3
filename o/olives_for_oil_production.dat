40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Spain herewith {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State Spain (EMS Spain), received and application from Syngenta Agro to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance thiamethoxam in artichokes, table olives and <b>olives</b> <b>for</b> <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> and for clothianidin in table olives and <b>olives</b> <b>for</b> <b>oil</b> <b>production,</b> based on the intended use of thiamethoxam. Spain received also another application from Syngenta Crop Protection AG to modify the existing MRLs for thiamethoxam and clothianidin in cauliflower, based on the intended use of thiamethoxam. In order to accommodate for the intended SEU use of thiamethoxam, the EMS Spain proposed to raise the existing MRLs for thiamethoxam in table olives and <b>olives</b> <b>for</b> <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> from 0. 05 mg/kg to 0. 5 mg/kg and to raise the existing MRLs for clothianidin in table olives, <b>olives</b> <b>for</b> <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> and cauliflower, resulting from the use of thiamethoxam from 0. 02 mg/kg to 0. 09 and 0. 05 mg/kg, respectively. For artichokes, the existing MRLs for thiamethoxam and clothianidin, and for cauliflower the existing MRL for thiamethoxam, {{do not need to be}} modified. Germany, herewith {{referred to as the}} evaluating Member State Germany (EMS Germany), compiled an application to raise the existing MRLs for clothianidin in herbs (except chervil) to 1. 5 mg/kg, based on the intended NEU use of clothianidin. According to EFSA, the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals for thiamethoxam and clothianidin in the crops under consideration. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the intended use of thiamethoxam on table olives, <b>olives</b> <b>for</b> <b>oil</b> <b>production,</b> cauliflower and artichokes as well as the intended use of clothianidin on herbs, will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern. EFSA notes that Member States when granting new authorizations on the use of thiamethoxam and clothianidin implement appropriate risk mitigation measures to protect honey bees...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{consumption}} {{of olive oil}} and table olives has recently determined an expansion of olive tree cultivation in the world. This trend {{is supported by the}} documented nutritional value of the Mediterranean diet. The aim of this work was to test a portable visible/ near infrared (vis/NIR) system (400 - 1000 nm) for the analysis of physical-chemical parameters, such as olive soluble solid content (SSC) and texture before the olive oil extraction process. The final goal is to provide the sector with post-harvest methods and sorting systems for a quick evaluation of important properties of olive fruit. In the present study, a total of 109 <b>olives</b> <b>for</b> <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> were analysed. Olive spectra registered with the optical device and values obtained with destructive analysis in the laboratory were analysed. Specific statistical models were elaborated to study correlations between optical and laboratory analysis, and to evaluate predictions of reference parameters obtained through the analysis of the visible-near infrared range. Statistical models were processed using chemometric techniques to extract maximum data information. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on vis/NIR spectra to examine sample groupings and identify outliers, while partial least square (PLS) regression algorithm was used to correlate samples spectra and physical- chemical properties. Results are encouraging. PCA showed a significant sample grouping among different ranges of SSC and texture. PLS models gave fairly good predictive capabilities in validation for SSC (R 2 = 0. 67 and RMSECV%= 7. 5 %) and texture (R 2 = 0. 68 and RMSECV%= 8. 2 %) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Portugal, herewith {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from the company Agriphar to lower the existing MRLs for dodine in pome fruits, apricots and cherries (for less critical European uses) and to raise the existing MRL in olives (for the new SEU use) and bananas (for the authorized use in Northern, Central and South America). The lowering of the MRLs for the crops mentioned is justified as for the existing MRLs for apples, pears, peaches and apricots acute consumer intake concerns cannot be excluded. According to EFSA, the submitted data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals or tentative MRL proposals for the crops under consideration, except in apricots. The applicant is recommended to perform a study investigating the freezer storage stability of dodine residues in high oil content matrices to confirm the validity of the residue trials submitted in support of the MRL request for olives. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the new intended use of dodine on table olives, <b>olives</b> <b>for</b> <b>oil</b> <b>production,</b> the proposed less critical use on pome fruit, cherries and peaches, and the authorized use on banana will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern.

40|$|This paper studies {{production}} planning with random yield and demand. It is {{a departure from}} previous studies of random yield in that it defines the sale price and the purchasing cost as exogenous and increasing with decreasing yield. While this behavior {{can be observed in}} various industries (e. g., citrus), the paper focuses on the olive oil industry as its application. <b>Production</b> of olive <b>oil</b> is a challenging business as olives grow every other year; thus, a risky investment is involved. A new practice among olive oil producers involves leasing farm space from farmers to grow olives. When the yield of olives is low (because of weather, disease, etc.), the oil producer gets a second chance to buy olives from other farmers at a unit cost varying with the yield. In this case, the sale price of olive oil increases in the market place because of the reduced supply. When the yield is high, the company uses some of its <b>olives</b> <b>for</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> and some are salvaged. After olives are pressed and olive oil is produced, the company experiences an uncertain demand. The paper makes four contributions: First, it is shown that the objective function is concave in the amount of farm space leased, so that the first-order conditions provide the globally optimal solution. Second, it illustrates how the total <b>production</b> of olive <b>oil</b> changes with the yield. Third, it proves that the optimal amount of farm space leased decreases under the presence of a second (and reliable) source of supply. Finally, unlike traditional yield papers, the fourth result shows that increased yield variance does not necessarily increase the optimal amount of farm space to be leased when there is a second chance to obtain supplies. {{production planning}}, yield and demand uncertainty, stochastic programming, yield-dependent price, yield-dependent cost, olive <b>oil</b> <b>production...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{wild olive}} {{subspecies}} oleaster called “Karadelice ” in Turkish {{is a small}} tree or bush of rather irregular growth, with thorny branches and oppositely positioned oblong pointed leaves, dark grayish-green on the leaf surface and, in the early growth state, hoary on the lower surface with whitish scales. Generally, it {{is used as a}} dwarf rootstock; however, it has some grafting incompatibility with certain important olive cultivars. Some wild olive plants were selected from the village Kayadibi, 20 km distant from the city of İzmir in Turkey. This region is a very unique place for this type of wild olive. These ecotypes were differentiated by molecular markers using RAPD-PCR. Since they {{can be used as a}} dwarf rootstock, the correlations with some important olive cultivars were analyzed. For that reason Ayvalık cv, which is the most important <b>olive</b> cultivar <b>for</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> was used primarily.

These quarries developed below ground because the calcarenite is generally located covered by clays (ranging in thickness from a few to 15 meters). Their abandonment, and the progressive weathering of the rock, has caused failures in the underground quarries.

The fate of the olive phenolic compounds, including oleuropein, and antioxidant activity was investigated at each stage {{of the process and}} the waste products (pomace and wastewater) were evaluated as potential sources of valuable phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity. The largest loss of phenolic compounds was seen at the crushing stage (60 % of phenolic compounds, 70 % of oleuropein) but only 21 % of antioxidant activity was lost. Malaxation did not cause significant losses of phenolic compounds but the antioxidant activity was affected (43 % loss). Pomace retained 26 % of the phenolic compounds, 21 % of the oleuropein and 33 % of the antioxidant activity. When dried, the phenolic compounds and oleuropein were 3. 5 -fold concentrated in the wastewater and it exhibited a 2. 7 -fold increase in antioxidant activity compared to whole olives.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the rural settlement, landscape and two rural economic activities: olive <b>oil</b> and amphorae <b>production</b> on the Tarhuna plateau of Tripolitania. This was gendered from the Late Neo-Punic through the Roman period. Tripolitania {{is considered one}} of the main olive <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> regions during the Roman imperial era. Previous studies have tended to stress that presses of the Gebel Tarhuna were totally used <b>for</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>production,</b> but the new evidence identified by the Tarhuna Archaeological Survey (TAS) has addressed that the wine was also produced to some extent in this area during the Roman period. The study has shown that there was a close relationship between olive <b>oil</b> and wine <b>production</b> and amphorae production by identifying new 14 amphora kiln sites with a quite large number of amphora stamps. These stamps reveal that these amphora workshops mostly located within estates belong to the urban elite. The dissertation is divided into six chapters. The first half of the thesis is dealing with the geographic and literary background, the TAS and the ancient rural settlement on the Tarhuna plateau. After this, chapters are devoted to examine pressing facilities and the press element typology. This examination led me to estimate the capacity production of about 200 presses recorded in the Wadis Turgut and Doga with their close relationship to amphora production sites. Finally, some evaluation points are made with attention paid to the importance of future work as a key factor for improvement the knowledge about rural economic and settlement in this hinterland region of Tripolitania.

According to the previous results, in this paper the study has been extended to power consumption aspects related to the main quality features of the extracted olive oil, restricting the analysis only to the hammer crushing (Coratina cultivar), which represents the worst case. In particular, {{the effect of the}} olives delivery on the power consumption and quality of the extracted oil has been studied. The experimental trials, carried out on a laboratory plant during the 1993 - 94 and 1994 - 95 olive-oil seasons, show that, even though the diagram of power consumption has a parabolic increasing trend, the specific power decreases with the olives delivery. Anyway, studying the olives hammer crushing process also from the qualitative point of view (polyphenols number, acidity, peroxide number and induction time), it is possible to define an optimal range of olives delivery values. This optimal range (140 kg/h- 240 kg/h for the studied hammer crusher) represents the better working solution from both {{the point of view of}} the power consumption and the quality of the extracted oil. In particular, at the beginning of the olive oil season it is necessary to work near the greatest lower bound of the optimal range just defined. With the passing of the harvesting time, the olives delivery has to be increased, reaching values near the greatest higher bound at the end of the olive oil season...|$|R

This olive husk is usually carried from presses to an Olive Waste Management Center where a mechanical milling extraction process is performed to obtain Olive Pomace Oil. The remaining oil in the husk is chemically extracted and finally, the residual husk is used as fuel for a cogeneration process to produce electricity. The olive Pomace Oil from mechanical milling has higher quality and price than the one extracted chemically. As the seasonal olive collection campaign is from October to March, husk usually is stored and processed along the year. Due to the own husk chemical degradation and the constrained milling capacity, not all received husk is milled mechanically but always chemically. Different pools are used to store and classify husk qualities. There are pools for short, medium and long term horizons. Short term pools have low storage capacity and contains high quality husk which is shortly milled mechanically. Medium term pools have higher storage capacity containing medium quality husk. These mid term pools provide husk to be milled mechanically when the collection rate decreases, or the husk quality coming from presses is poor. Long term pools have also high storage capacity and store husk with poor quality to be processed only chemically. The stochastic model is focused on optimal pouring decisions into different types of pools to improve {{the efficiency of the}} husk mechanical milling. Several probabilistic scenarios of weekly husk pouring from presses are included in the stochastic programming model. Blending husk with different qualities brings nonlinear constraints into the computation of milling efficiency. To cope with these nonlinearities, an accurate approximation has been developed.

In 2003 in Castelvetrano (Trapani province, Sicily), tests on the effectiveness of Surround WP, a product containing 95 % of kaolin, were carried out on three table olive cultivars, Nocellara del Belice, Moresca and Tonda Iblea. In 2004, in the same field and on the same cultivars, BPLK kaolin was tested too. In the second year the two products containing kaolin were also tested on Cerasuola cultivar in an organic olive grove located in Trapani, comparing them with copper hydroxide. At Castelvetrano both in 2003 and in 2004 B. oleae infestation levels of the plots treated with the two products containing kaolin were statistically lower than those of the control plots. In this site, in 2004 Surround WP protected olives significantly better than BPLK kaolin, limiting olive fly harmful infestation up to 17 - 23 % vs. 68 - 87 % of BPLK plots. At Trapani in 2004, the two products containing kaolin and copper hydroxide showed statistically significant differences from the untreated control, but not among themselves, limiting the harmful infestation up to 3 - 37 % vs. 87 % of the control. The different results of 2004 recorded by Surround WP and BPLK kaolin in the two olive groves seems linked to the different rainfall of the period after the last treatment, 64 mm in three rainy days at Castelvetrano and 41 mm in eight rainy days at Trapani; BPLK kaolin was probably washed away more than Surround WP.

Throughout the process, pH, NaCl, acidity, free biophenol content and microbiological analysis (Colony count, Coliforms (Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Escherichia coli), Lactobacilli (25 ºC, 36 ºC, 45 ºC), Pseudomonas (P. fluorescens, P. cepacia), Yeasts (Candida spp.), Moulds (Penicillum spp., Clostridium spp., Vibrio spp.) of brines were performed. The results showed that an initial pH correction is recommended and no long soaking of the olives in water (3 + 3 days) is advisable, except a short washing just before brining. Por primera vez, se ha estudiado una fermentación natural de aceitunas negras de la variedad Taggiasca (Olea europaea L.). Esta variedad es típica del Oeste de Liguria (Noroeste de Italia), donde se usa principalmente para la producción de aceite de oliva. Además del proceso tradicional, tres procesos ligeramente diferentes fueron considerados. La fermentación fue llevada a cabo en barriles de 200 litros mantenidos a temperatura ambiente (7 - 25 ºC) y duró aproximadamente  6 meses. Al final las aceitunas fueron pasteurizadas y almacenadas durante otros 6 meses para equilibrarlas. A  través de todo el proceso se analizaron: pH, NaCl, acidez, contenido en biofenoles y análisis microbiológico (recuento de colonias, coliformes (Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Escherichia coli), Lactobacilos (25 ºC, 36 ºC, 45 ºC), Pseudomonas (P. fluorescens, P. cepacia), Levaduras (Candida spp.), Mohos (Penicillum spp., Clostridium spp., Vibrio spp.) de salmueras. Los resultados mostraron que es recomendable una corrección inicial del pH y una inmersión no demasiado larga de las aceitunas en agua (3 + 3 días), excepto un corto lavado justo antes de ponerlas en salmuera...|$|R
