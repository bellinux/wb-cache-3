40|$|Abstract. The Planck Low Frequency Instrument {{will recover}} {{polarization}} by differencing the outputs from radiometers sensitive to orthogonal polarizations. We contrast the systematic errors that afflict {{such a system}} with those that affect correlation polarimeters; the Planck design has some important advantages when measuring very weak signals such as the CMB. We also review systematic effects arising from the choice of scan strategy for all-sky mapping missions like Planck. [For the Planck-LFI consortium]. DIFFERENCING VS. CORRELATION POLARIMETERS Radiometers {{can be used to}} measure polarization in two fundamentally different ways. Differencing polarimeters work {{in much the same way}} as polarimeters used in other wavebands; that is, the radiation is filtered to isolate components in several different pure polarization states and these are combined to derive the required Stokes parameters. The Planck Low Frequency Instrument (LFI), described in these proceedings by Villa, is of this type. Each feed horn couples the incoming radiation to a waveguide, essentially preserving the polarization state (deviations from this approximation will be discussed later). An OMT separates the radiation into two <b>orthogonal</b> <b>linear</b> <b>components</b> (‘X ’ and ‘Y’) which are separately amplified and square-law detected. Ideally, the sum of these signals is proportional to Stokes I, while the difference measures one component of the (Q,U) vector. This is formally equivalent to a Wollaston prism system in optical polarimetry. To obtain the full linear polarization vector, mor...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{users have}} a high demand for the {{accuracy}} of position and velocity, but errors caused by non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals cannot be removed effectively. Since the GNSS signal is right-hand circular polarized (RHCP), the axial ratio of the strong NLOS signal is larger {{than that of the}} Line-of-Sight (LOS) signal. Based on the difference of the axial ratio, a method for NLOS signal detection using single orthogonal dual-polarized antenna is proposed. The antenna has two channels to receive two <b>orthogonal</b> <b>linear</b> polarized <b>components</b> of the incoming signals. Parallel cross-cancellation is used to remove the LOS signal while maintaining most of the NLOS signals from the receiving signals. The residual NLOS signals are then detected by conventional GNSS digital processor in real time without any prior knowledge of their characteristics. The proposed method makes use of the polarization and spatial information and can detect long delay NLOS signal by miniature and inexpensive receiver GNSS. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by simulation data...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the mirror}} {{symmetry}} breaking, chiral structures show fantastic electromagnetic (EM) properties involving negative refraction, giant optical activity, and asymmetric transmission. Aligned electric and magnetic dipoles excited in chiral structures contribute to extraordinary properties. However, the chiral structures that exhibit n-fold rotational symmetry show limited tuning capability. In this paper, we proposed a compact, light, and highly tunable anisotropic chiral structure to overcome this limitation and realize a linear-to-circular polarization conversion. The anisotropy is due to simultaneous excitations of two different pairs of aligned electric and magnetic dipoles. The 3 D omega-like structure, etched on two sides of one PCB board and connected by metallic vias, achieves 60 % of linearto- circular conversion (transmission) efficiency at the operating frequency of 9. 2 GHz. The desired 90 -degree phase shift between the two <b>orthogonal</b> <b>linear</b> polarization <b>components</b> is {{not only from the}} finite-thickness dielectric substrate but also from the anisotropic chiral response slightly off the resonance. The work enables elegant and practical polarization control of EM waves. Comment: 7 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the design, construction, and {{characterization of the}} Band 9 heterodyne receivers (600 - 720 GHz) for the Atacama Large Millimeter / submillimeter Array (ALMA). The ALMA Band 9 receiver units ("cartridges"), which are installed in the telescope's front end, {{have been designed to}} detect and down-convert two <b>orthogonal</b> <b>linear</b> polarization <b>components</b> of the light collected by the ALMA antennas. The light entering the front end is refocused with a compact arrangement of mirrors, which is fully contained within the cartridge. The arrangement contains a grid to separate the polarizations and two beam splitters to combine each resulting beam with a local oscillator signal. The combined beams are fed into independent double-sideband mixers, each with a corrugated feedhorn coupling the radiation by way of a waveguide with backshort cavity into an impedance-tuned SIS junction that performs the heterodyne down-conversion. Finally, the generated intermediate frequency signals are amplified by cryogenic and room-temperature HEMT amplifiers and exported to the telescope's back end for further processing and, finally, correlation.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{technique}} of extracting water cloud particle size information from lidar measurements {{in conjunction with}} double scattering calculations. In this presentation, we describe the technique and give examples using data taken with the Air Force Phillips Laboratory's (Geophysics Directorate) low altitude Nd:YAG, elastic backscatter lidar. In a related presentation we describe the double scattering lidar model which we developed for this work. The technique uses simultaneous measurements of two <b>orthogonal</b> <b>linear</b> polarization <b>components</b> of lidar returns from water clouds or other media composed of spherical particles. Any depolarization of the incident lidar radiation backscattered by such a media can only be due to multiple scattering. The amount of depolarization {{is dependent on the}} extinction coefficient and the single scatter phase matrix, both of which are functions of position in the medium. The phase matrix is dependent on the index of refraction of the particles and the particle size distribution. Our technique is a modification of a procedure presented in Reference 1. There, particle sizes of water clouds are determined from double scattering calculations together with measurements of radiation scattered from volumes outside the lidar receiver's field of view (which can only be multiply scattered radiation). The methodology of our technique is similar but our 'probe' of the scattering phase function (and thus the particle size distribution) is different...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the regularized <b>orthogonal</b> <b>linear</b> {{discriminant}} analysis (ROLDA) is studied. The major {{issue of the}} regularized linear discriminant analysis is to choose an appropriate regularization parameter. In existing regularized linear discriminant analysis methods, they all select the best regularization parameter from a given parameter candidate set by using cross-validation for classification. An obvious limitation of such regularized linear discriminant analysis methods {{is that it is}} not clear how to choose an appropriate candidate set. Therefore, up to now, there is no concrete mathematical theory available in selecting an appropriate regularization parameter in practical applications of the regularized linear discriminant analysis. The present work is to fill this gap. Here we derive the mathematical relationship between <b>orthogonal</b> <b>linear</b> discriminant analysis and the regularized <b>orthogonal</b> <b>linear</b> discriminant analysis first, and then by means of this relationship we find a mathematical criterion for selecting the regularization parameter in ROLDA and consequently we develop a new regularized <b>orthogonal</b> <b>linear</b> discriminant analysis method, in which no candidate set of regularization parameter is needed. The effectiveness of our proposed regularized <b>orthogonal</b> <b>linear</b> discriminant analysis is illustrated by some real-world data sets. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The advantages of such a device over a spinning wave-plate modulator for measuring astronomical polarization in the far-infrared through millimeter are: 1. The use of small, linear motions {{eliminates the need for}} cryogenic rotational bearings, 2. The phase flexibility allows measurement of Stokes V as well as Q and U, and 3. The QVI allows for both multi-wavelength and broadband modulation. We suggest two implementations of this device as an astronomical polarization modulator. The first involves two such modulators placed in series. By adjusting the two phase delays, it is possible to use such a modulator to measure Stokes Q, U, and V for passbands that are not too large. Conversely, a single QVI may be used to measure Q and V independent of frequency. In this implementation, Stokes U must be measured by rotating the instrument.

40|$|Their unique {{geometrical}} structure first {{suggested by}} Prof. Kenichi Iga in 1977, makes vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) compact, versatile, robust and reliable optoelectronic devices, which have already outperformed edge-emitting lasers (EELs) {{in terms of}} low threshold current and high wall-plug efficiency. Most relevantly, regarding application field entering and mass production, is their low cost manufacturing due to their property of enabling wafer-level testing. In addition to these benefits provided by their vertical design, VCSELs exhibit complex polarization behavior resulting from the circular symmetry of their resonator and from the isotropic gain of their active medium, mostly based on quantum well (QW) or quantum dots (QD). In principle, the polarization of the light emitted by these optoelectronic devices should reflect the selection rules of the quantum well (QW) optical transition symmetry and thus should exhibit a circularly polarized state of light. However, various symmetry breaking mechanisms, such as strain, thermal effects, electro-optically induced birefringence, dichroism or an applied magnetic field convert this circular polarization to an elliptically polarized emission, often with {{a large amount of}} linearly polarized light. Therefore, at a first glance, polarization resolved investigations, using a linear polarizer only, on intensity noise, wave chaos, transverse mode behavior and time-resolved measurements are legitimized, although being restricted to a projection on two <b>orthogonal</b> <b>linear</b> polarization <b>components.</b> But clearly these kinds of measurements do not reveal the entire knowledge of the polarization state, due to the conversion of an eventual circular <b>component</b> into a <b>linear</b> <b>component.</b> In contrast to this rather simple, straightforward projection method the full information about the state of polarization is accessible only by determining the four Stokes polarization parameters (SPPs) S 0, S 1, S 2 and S 3. The remarkable fact about these four parameters is that they are directly measurable quantities, thus enabling the complete description of any state of polarization in mathematical terms, including unpolarized light as well as partially polarized light. Noteworthy about the Stokes formalism is the fact, that it has been invented already in 1852 by Sir George Gabriel Stokes. During this time, a crisis in optics appeared due to fundamental different approaches namely the wave- as well as the corpuscular-ansatz. The formulation of the SPPs supports the wave theory essentially, providing explanation of the famous Fresnel-Arago interference laws {{on the basis of the}} wave approach for the first time. These SPPs formulated in 1852, are even nowadays the appropriate formalism to describe the complex polarization behavior of VCSELs. The aim of this work is to conduct comprehensive experimental investigations on spatially, spectrally and time-resolved SPPs of transverse single-mode and transverse multi-mode VCSELs. Furthermore, combined measurements such as spatio-spectrally as well as spectro-temporally resolved measurements will be also performed and compared among each other, demonstrating the consistency and reliability of these quantitative results. Moreover, a detailed analysis of each particular transverse mode will be performed, uncovering the physical mechanisms responsible for the state of polarization of the total emission of transverse single-mode as well as multi-mode VCSELs. In addition the time dependence of polarization states of the total emission on a microsecond timescale will be investigated. These overall results in combination with investigations on time-resolved SPPs measurements for each particular transverse mode will be a point of origin for future numerical simulations...|$|R
