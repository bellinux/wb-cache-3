40|$|The European {{electricity}} {{sector is}} undergoing radical changes in every {{segment of the}} power industry, from generation to supply. Ambitious policy goals set at European level to enhance the competitiveness, security and sustainability of the EU's energy system have called for {{major changes in the}} regulatory, technological, and market structure fields. The distribution sector is particularly affected by these changes. The increasing penetration of local renewable generation and the emergence of demand response enabling solutions are placing new requirements on the distribution networks, posing challenges to the reliability and efficiency of system operation. At the same time however, these new applications can also create opportunities to manage the distribution grids in a more flexible and efficient way. Smart grid concepts and technologies have an important role to play to address these new challenges and opportunities. A variety of solutions are already being tested in Europe, with encouraging results. Identifying the best technical, economic and social options requires a deep understanding of their impact on the physical distribution networks. Such knowledge is also necessary to evaluate the viability of replicating and scaling up pilot experiences already successfully implemented in Europe. At present, there is little publicly available information on the European distribution system operators (DSOs) and the networks they operate. Such lack of knowledge is partly attributable to the DSOs' reluctance to share data that can be considered as assets of commercial value, but it is also due to the vast number and heterogeneity of the distribution systems in Europe. The situation varies radically from country to country, due to historical as well as geographical, legal, political and economic reasons. In some Member States there is only one DSO, while in others there are tens or hundreds of them operating their networks on a regional or even municipal basis. Differences concern also other aspects, e. g. the scope of the DSO activities, the level of unbundling, the operated voltage levels and other key technical information on the networks. In the last years, the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC) has expanded its role as an independent observer of the energy system developments and transitions. Particularly, a big effort has been put in collecting, processing and analysing data on the power sector (from smart grid project costs and benefits to consumer engagement strategies, from power system techno-economic features to integrated regional systems/markets). This activity is aimed at providing stakeholders with tools and analyses to better understand the rapidly changing scene, enabling early identification of developments and opportunities and supporting evidence-based policy making. This report presents the latest JRC data brokering effort – the DSO Observatory project - focused on European distribution system operators and their distribution networks. The aim of the report is to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the challenges that the transition to a new energy system is posing to European distribution system operators and to elaborate sound solutions to address them. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive data collection exercise on European distribution systems published so far. Based upon this inventory, detailed reference network models (RNM) are developed to analyse the impact of distributed energy resources (DER) penetration and network automation on the technical performance of the distribution networks and to make available to the wider scientific community instruments to perform realistic simulations and analyses. The starting point of the DSO Observatory project was the collection of technical and structural data from the DSOs. Given the vast number of DSOs in Europe, the data collection exercise was limited to the bigger ones, i. e. the 190 DSOs that have to comply with the unbundling requirements set out in the EU Electricity Directive (i. e. the DSOs serving more than 100, 000 customers, also referred to in the report as "larger DSO"). An online survey was launched in January 2015 with the aim of collecting several clusters of data, relating to types of <b>ownership</b> and <b>unbundling,</b> network structures and designs, amounts and types of connected distributed generation, and reliability of supply indicators. 79 out of the 190 larger DSOs responded to the survey. The representativeness of the obtained sample is quite high: the respondents manage over 70 % of the electricity supplied by all DSOs serving over 100, 000 customers. Together, the 79 DSOs distribute more than 2, 000 TWh of electricity to over 200 million customers per year, covering a total area of more than 3 million square km. The collected data were used to build 36 indicators, divided in three categories, i. e. network structure, network design and distributed generation. These indicators allow for comparison of the parameters and criteria used by DSOs when designing and sizing their network installations. They help to shed some light on the different characteristics of some of the major European distribution networks and to support research activities by reducing the amount of resources that are typically devoted to compiling input data and building case studies. The project however also aimed at providing a tool to enable more sophisticated technical and economic assessment of different policy and technological solutions. For this purpose, 10 of the 36 indicators were chosen to create reference network models, i. e. large-scale network distribution planning tools that allow designing realistic distribution networks useful for simulation activities. RNMs allow the design of networks that supply the expected demand while taking into consideration the need to minimize the total investment and associated operational costs and to meet the defined reliability and quality of supply criteria. By providing a realistic distribution network, RNMs offer the possibility to reliably simulate the impact of different scenarios on the grid without the need to have access to the actual network data. Two large-scale representative networks, one rural and one urban, were selected to carry out the simulation analyses. The networks were used to analyse the impact of increasing levels of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) penetration, solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind in particular, on the technical performance of the grid. The impact on network voltages and network overloads was then monetised by means of a penalty cost function. The analyses show that the number and size of PV units, as well as their concentration/distribution on the network are all relevant parameters. By way of illustration, results highlight that limiting the size of the generation units would allow mitigating voltage and congestion problems, maximizing renewable penetration with no need of additional network investments. A careful consideration of the local conditions of each distribution area as well as of the different connection patterns - including unit sizes, technologies and location within the network - is therefore of paramount importance to minimize adverse impacts on the network. Another way to mitigate the voltage spread introduced by the increasing penetration of PV connected to the distribution network has been studied considering the installation of storage units where the PV are located. However from the carried analysis a spread voltage reduction is only observed when big storage units are installed for each PV unit. The high costs per kWh estimated for batteries in the storage market suggest however that other solutions should be considered to mitigate voltage spread in the distribution network. Finally a reliability analysis is reported, showing how the System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) could be reduced by increasing the installation of tele-controlled switches in the distribution network. The analyses presented in the report provide an illustrative example of the potential applications of the representative networks built within the DSOs Observatory project. Other applications are however possible and this report can be seen as a first step of an exercise that will continue in the future. The JRC will carry on in its scientific and policy support activities to better understand and address the challenges DSOs have to face in the transition to the new energy system. JRC.

40|$|Several {{countries}} around the world have introduced reforms to the electric power sector. One important element of these reforms is the introduction of an unbundling process, i. e., the separation of the competitive activities of supply and production from the monopole activity of transmission and distribution of electricity. There are several forms of unbundling: functional, legal and ownership. New Zealand, for instance, adopted an <b>ownership</b> <b>unbundling</b> in 1998. As discussed in the literature, <b>ownership</b> <b>unbundling</b> produces benefits and costs. One of the benefits may be an improvement in the level of the productive efficiency of the companies due {{to the use of the}} inputs in just one activity and a greater level of transparency for the regulator.

Using a stochastic frontier panel data model, a total cost function and a variable cost function are estimated in order to evaluate the impact of <b>ownership</b> <b>unbundling</b> on the level of cost efficiency. The results indicate that ownership separation of electricity generation and retail operations from the distribution network has a positive effect on the cost efficiency of distribution companies in New Zealand.

If energy sector was considered an exclusive competence of every State Member (or as a part of its national security), nowadays, it has made a big step forward. At present, we talk about the establishment of a competitive internal energy market. The energy policy became part of the Community law only after the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty when the sector was granted a separate chapter and henceforth decided upon through a co-decisional procedure. The energy markets were subsequently given a new liberalisation impetus by the approval of the 3 rd energy package (July 2009). My thesis focuses entirely on the natural gas sector and its crucial amendment to the network sector regulations. The core subject of the Directive 2009 / 73 /EC concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas is the <b>ownership</b> <b>unbundling</b> regime which stipulates the separation of production and sale operations from their transmission networks. This separation from the former vertically integrated utilities is supposed to guarantee an equal and non-discriminatory access to the transmission networks. Even though the <b>ownership</b> <b>unbundling</b> regime [...] ...|$|E

D. dissertation focuses on a central question about regulation in the EU and US electricity markets: the effects of vertical integration of generation and transmission and distribution networks. I focus on the forms of vertical integration where the generation and network firms are partly separated, such as in a legal or organizational form. Such form of separation is called unbundling. In the first two papers, I develop theoretical models to analyze the economic effects of vertical integration under legal unbundling (firms are legally separated entities and have the same owner) relative to <b>ownership</b> <b>unbundling</b> (firms are legally separated entities and have different owners). Both papers have policy implications for the regulation of the EU and US electricity markets, and make new contributions to auction theory, especially toehold auctions. In the first paper I consider the legal unbundling of the network activities; in the second paper I consider the legal unbundling of both the network activities and the generation activity. In both papers I find theoretical evidence that, in terms of efficiency, legal unbundling gives results inferior to <b>ownership</b> <b>unbundling.</b> Furthermore, I find solutions for several cases of toehold auctions {{that have not been}} solved before and that I believe to be interesting [...] CERGEFaculty of Social SciencesFakulta sociálních vě...|$|E
40|$|Britain was the {{exemplar of}} {{electricity}} market reform, demonstrating {{the importance of}} <b>ownership</b> <b>unbundling</b> and workable competition in generation and supply. Privatisation created de facto duopolies that supported increasing price-cost margins and induced excessive (English) entry. Concentration was ended by trading horizontal for vertical integration in subsequent mergers. Competition arrived just as the Pool was replaced by New Electricity Trading Arrangements (NETA) intended to address its claimed shortcomings. NETA cost over £ 700 million, and had ambiguous market impacts. Prices fell dramatically {{as a result of}} (pre-NETA) competition, generating companies withdrew plant, causing fears about security of supply and a subsequent widening of price-cost margins. ...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} provisions of the European electricity directives is the so-called unbundling of structures and functions. Vertical disintegration with <b>ownership</b> <b>unbundling</b> is considered an important step toward electricity market restructuring. While full unbundling models {{appear to be the}} most prevalent, several European countries adhered solely to less stringent forms of unbundling. Using a dataset of the 35 major electricity transmission utilities in Europe, this study provides an econometric analysis to understand the individual effect of regulation and ownership structure on the decision to adopt more stringent unbundling regimes. The overall results show that incentive-based or hybrid regulatory schemes and private ownership, are associated with a higher probability that a country will opt for full unbundlin...|$|E
