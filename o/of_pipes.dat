5|$|A {{pipe organ}} {{contains}} {{one or more}} sets <b>of</b> <b>pipes,</b> a wind system, and one or more keyboards. The pipes produce sound when pressurized air produced by the wind system passes through them. An action connects the keyboards to the pipes. Stops allow the organist to control which ranks <b>of</b> <b>pipes</b> sound at a given time. The organist operates the stops and the keyboards from the console.|$|E
5|$|Pipes are {{arranged}} by timbre and pitch into ranks. A rank {{is a set}} <b>of</b> <b>pipes</b> of the same timbre but multiple pitches (one for each note on the keyboard), which is mounted (usually vertically) onto a windchest. The stop mechanism admits air to each rank. For a given pipe to sound, the stop governing the pipe's rank must be engaged, and the key corresponding to its pitch must be depressed. Ranks <b>of</b> <b>pipes</b> are organized into groups called divisions. Each division generally is played from its own keyboard and conceptually comprises an individual instrument within the organ.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes, {{a single}} rank <b>of</b> <b>pipes</b> {{may be able}} to be {{controlled}} by several stops, allowing the rank to be played at multiple pitches or on multiple manuals. Such a rank is said to be unified or borrowed. For example, an 8 Diapason rank may also be made available as a 4 Octave. When both of these stops are selected and a key (for example, c) is pressed, two pipes of the same rank will sound: the pipe normally corresponding to the key played (c), and the pipe one octave above that (c). Because the 8 rank does not have enough pipes to sound the top octave of the keyboard at 4 pitch, it is common for an extra octave <b>of</b> <b>pipes</b> used only for the borrowed 4 stop to be added. In this case, the full rank <b>of</b> <b>pipes</b> (now an extended rank) is one octave longer than the keyboard.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{relatively}} weak <b>pipe</b> or area <b>of</b> water distribution {{can be estimated}} by calculating the probability <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> break and thickness index. And safety degree of area in water distribution system can be estimated by thickness index which is introduced in this study. Thickness index is the ratio of estimated thickness <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> and real used thickness <b>of</b> <b>pipe.</b> Thickness index can express the safety degree <b>of</b> each <b>pipe</b> or each area of water distribution system. In the present study, water hammer pressure which can be appear in two test beds of water distribution system is considered for the estimation <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> thickness. Estimated thickness <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> was used to estimate the thickness index of each area of water distribution system. Thickness index and probability <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> break were estimated for a small block and water distribution system. From the results, {{it was found that}} thickness index and probability <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> break can be used to determine the weakest link of water distribution system. And {{it can be used to}} determine the priority rank <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> in water distribution system for the repair or replacement...|$|R
50|$|Pipe clamps serve {{a similar}} purpose to bar clamps but are {{generally}} {{less expensive to}} purchase and have a versatility derived from {{the ability to use}} a variety <b>of</b> lengths <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> to suit ones needs. The same clamp heads might be switched over from a two-foot length <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> to a twelve-foot length as the project at hand dictates. Having threads at both ends <b>of</b> the <b>pipe</b> also allows the use <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> couplings, joining two lengths <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> to extend the length of the clamp.|$|R

5|$|The {{pipe organ}} is a musical {{instrument}} that produces sound by driving pressurized air (called wind) through organ pipes selected via a keyboard. Because each pipe produces a single pitch, the pipes are provided in sets called ranks, {{each of which has}} a common timbre and volume throughout the keyboard compass. Most organs have multiple ranks <b>of</b> <b>pipes</b> of differing timbre, pitch, and volume that the player can employ singly or in combination through the use of controls called stops.|$|E

5|$|Each stop usually {{controls}} one rank <b>of</b> <b>pipes,</b> although mixtures and undulating stops (such as the Voix c√©leste) control multiple ranks. The name of {{the stop}} reflects not only the stop's timbre and construction, but also {{the style of the}} organ in which it resides. For example, the names on an organ built in the north German Baroque style generally will be derived from the German language, while the names of similar stops on an organ in the French Romantic style will usually be French. Most countries tend to use only their own languages for stop nomenclature. English-speaking nations as well as Japan are more receptive to foreign nomenclature. Stop names are not standardized: two otherwise identical stops from different organs may have different names.|$|E
5|$|Early {{experiments}} with floating petroleum {{on the sea}} and igniting it were not entirely successful: the fuel was difficult to ignite, large quantities were required to cover even modest areas and the weapon was easily disrupted by waves. However, the potential was clear. By early 1941 a flame barrage technique was developed. Rather than attempting to ignite oil floating on water, nozzles were placed above high-water mark with pumps producing sufficient pressure to spray fuel which produced a roaring wall of flame over, rather than on, the water. Such installations consumed considerable resources and although this weapon was impressive, its network <b>of</b> <b>pipes</b> was vulnerable to pre-landing bombardment; General Brooke did not consider it effective. Initially ambitious plans were cut back to cover {{just a few miles}} of beaches.|$|E
5|$|In a {{blast furnace}} fuel (coke), ores, and flux (limestone) are {{continuously}} supplied {{through the top}} of the furnace, while a hot blast of air (sometimes with oxygen enrichment) is blown into the lower section of the furnace through a series <b>of</b> <b>pipes</b> called tuyeres, so that the chemical reactions take place throughout the furnace as the material falls downward. The end products are usually molten metal and slag phases tapped from the bottom, and flue gases exiting from {{the top of the}} furnace. The downward flow of the ore and flux in contact with an upflow of hot, carbon monoxide-rich combustion gases is a countercurrent exchange and chemical reaction process.|$|E

5|$|The {{brain is}} {{a ring of}} four ganglia, {{positioned}} around the rhynchocoel near its front end. At least a pair of ventral nerve cords connect to the brain and run {{along the length of}} the body. Most nemerteans have various chemoreceptors, and on their heads some species have a number of pigment-cup ocelli. These ocelli can detect light but can not form an image. Nemerteans respire through the skin. They have at least two lateral vessels which are joined at the ends to form a loop, and these and the rhynchocoel are filled with fluid. There is no heart, and the flow of fluid depends on contraction of muscles in the vessels and the body wall. To filter out soluble waste products, flame cells are embedded in the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels, and remove the wastes through a network <b>of</b> <b>pipes</b> to the outside.|$|E
5|$|Work {{continued}} {{throughout the}} night of 15 October and into the following day. It focused on finding survivors and fighting the fire that blocked the entry into some workings of the western returns. The fire caused the roof supports to become unstable, and falls triggered outbursts of methane. Several rescuers were injured by the falls, one fatally. Before descending the mine many of the firefighters wrote what they thought might be their last letters home, and some made their wills. As the water pipe in the shaft was out of operation, fire-fighting continued with hand extinguishers and work was only possible in 20-minute shifts. Despite wearing respirators, several rescuers were overcome by the effects of firedamp. During {{the course of the}} day, 56 bodies were raised to the surface and, that evening, a new water supply, connected by three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) <b>of</b> <b>pipes</b> to a nearby reservoir, was installed in the Lancaster shaft.|$|E
