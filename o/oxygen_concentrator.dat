The cost of home oxygen is about 150 USD a month in Brazil and 400 USD a month in the United States.

5000|$|Usually, [...] "demand" [...] or pulse-flow <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrators</b> are {{not used}} by {{patients}} while they sleep. There have been problems with the <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrators</b> {{not being able to}} detect when the sleeping patient is inhaling. Some larger portable <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrators</b> are designed to operate in continuous-flow mode in addition to pulse-flow mode. Continuous-flow mode is considered safe for night use when coupled with a CPAP machine.|$|R
50|$|<b>Oxygen</b> <b>concentrators</b> are {{considered}} sufficiently foolproof {{to be supplied}} to individual patients as a prescription item for use in their homes. Typically they are used {{as an adjunct to}} CPAP treatment of severe sleep apnea. There also are other medical uses for <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrators,</b> including emphysema and other respiratory diseases.|$|R
2500|$|In the US, these [...] "mild {{personal}} hyperbaric chambers" [...] are {{categorized by}} the FDA as CLASS II medical devices and requires a prescription {{in order to}} purchase one or take treatments. Personal hyperbaric chambers are only FDA approved to reach 1.3 ATA. While hyperbaric chamber distributors and manufacturers cannot supply a chamber in the US with any form of elevated oxygen delivery system, a physician can write a prescription to combine the two modalities, {{as long as there}} is a prescription for both hyperbarics and oxygen. The most common option (but not approved by FDA) some patients choose is to acquire an <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrator</b> which typically delivers 85–96% oxygen as the breathing gas.|$|E
2500|$|This is {{the most}} common type of ozone {{generator}} for most industrial and personal uses. While variations of the [...] "hot spark" [...] coronal discharge method of ozone production exist, including medical grade and industrial grade ozone generators, these units usually work by means of a corona discharge tube. They are typically cost-effective and do not require an oxygen source other than the ambient air to produce ozone concentrations of 3–6%. Fluctuations in ambient air, due to weather or other environmental conditions, cause variability in ozone production. However, they also produce nitrogen oxides as a by-product. Use of an air dryer can reduce or eliminate nitric acid formation by removing water vapor and increase ozone production. Use of an <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrator</b> can further increase the ozone production and further reduce the risk of nitric acid formation by removing not only the water vapor, but also the bulk of the nitrogen.|$|E
2500|$|UV ozone {{generators}} use ambient air for ozone production, no air prep systems are used (air dryer or <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrator),</b> therefore these generators {{tend to be}} less expensive. [...] However UV {{ozone generators}} usually produce ozone with a concentration of about 0.5% or lower which limits the potential ozone production rate. Another disadvantage of this method is that it requires the ambient air (oxygen) to be exposed to the UV source for a longer amount of time, and any gas that is not exposed to the UV source will not be treated. This makes UV generators impractical for use in situations that deal with rapidly moving air or water streams (in-duct air sterilization, for example). Production of ozone is one of the potential dangers of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. VUV ozone generators are used in swimming pool and spa applications ranging to millions of gallons of water. VUV ozone generators, unlike corona discharge generators, do not produce harmful nitrogen by-products and also unlike corona discharge systems, VUV ozone generators work extremely well in humid air environments. There is also not normally a need for expensive off-gas mechanisms, and no need for air driers or oxygen concentrators which require extra costs and maintenance.|$|E
50|$|In both {{clinical}} and emergency-care situations, <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrators</b> {{have the advantage}} of not being as dangerous as oxygen cylinders, which can, if ruptured or leaking, greatly increase the combustion rate of a fire. As such, <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrators</b> are particularly advantageous in military or disaster situations, where oxygen tanks may be dangerous or unfeasible.|$|R
50|$|Industrial <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrators</b> are {{sometimes}} referred to as oxygen generators within the oxygen and ozone industries to distinguish them from medical <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrators.</b> The distinction is used in an attempt to clarify that industrial <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrators</b> are not medical devices approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and they are not suitable for use as bedside medical concentrators. However, applying the oxygen generator nomenclature can lead to confusion. The term, oxygen generator, is a misnomer in that the oxygen is not generated as it is with a chemical oxygen generator, but rather it is concentrated from the air.|$|R
50|$|The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has {{approved}} {{the use of}} portable <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrators</b> on commercial airlines. However, users of these devices should check in advance as to whether a particular brand or model is permitted on a particular airline. Unlike in commercial airlines, users of aircraft without cabin pressurization need <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrators</b> which are able to deliver enough flowrate even at high altitudes, such as OXYFLY.|$|R
2500|$|The Ekwendeni Hospital sees 21,000 out-patients annually, {{of which}} one-third are admitted. [...] It offers 183 beds and medical relief for {{an area of}} 45,000 with a larger {{referral}} area of 120,000 people. [...] The types of specialties that the hospital provides are nutrition, ophthalmology, dental surgery, and laboratory work. [...] The most commonly seen diseases are HIV, TB, and malaria. [...] To accommodate the TB cases, there is a 24-bed TB ward that serves these patients exclusively. In their lab, doctors and staff research and conduct 27,000 tests each year. The EMMS has focused on purchasing necessary equipment, constructing new space, and providing funds for the hospital staff and training. [...] The equipment that the EMMS has purchased includes a baby resuscitation equipment, a defibrillator, ECG machine, an anaesthetic machine, and an <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrator.</b> [...] There are three nurseries that have the capability of serving premature babies. [...] It has {{also contributed to the}} construction of a cattle shed to provide food and income for the hospital’s Orphan care Programme. The new operating theatre purchased by the EMMS has been hailed as vital by Enos Msowaya, the Senior Administrator of the hospital. [...] Msowaya writes, [...] "The new operating theatre enabled us to treat 12% more patients and improve recovery rates."

50|$|Portable <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrator</b> (POC) is a {{portable}} device {{used to provide}} oxygen therapy to people requiring greater oxygen concentrations than the levels of ambient air. It {{is similar to a}} home <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrator,</b> but is smaller in size and more mobile. The portable <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrator</b> makes it easy for patients to travel freely; they are small enough to fit in a car and many concentrators are now FAA-approved for use on airplanes.|$|E

2500|$|Oxygen from {{gas bottles}} or liquid {{containers}} {{can be applied}} directly via a nasal cannula or mask. <b>Oxygen</b> <b>concentrators</b> based upon pressure swing adsorption (PSA), VSA, or vacuum-pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) {{can be used to}} generate the oxygen if electricity is available. Stationary <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrators</b> typically use PSA technology, which has performance degradations at the lower barometric pressures at high altitudes. One way to compensate for the performance degradation is to utilize a concentrator with more flow capacity. There are also portable <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrators</b> that can be used on vehicular DC power or on internal batteries, and at least one system commercially available measures and compensates for the altitude effect on its performance up to [...] The application of high-purity oxygen from one of these methods increases the partial pressure of oxygen by raising the FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen).|$|R

40|$|The {{indications}} for {{the prescription}} of <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrators</b> have been assessed in 82 patients against the Department of Health guidelines, except {{that only one}} set of blood gas and spirometry measurements was required if the patient's condition was stable.
