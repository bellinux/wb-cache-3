25|$|Full-range drivers often employ an {{additional}} cone called a whizzer: a small, light cone {{attached to the}} joint between the voice coil and the primary cone. The whizzer cone extends the high-frequency response of the driver and broadens its high frequency directivity, which would otherwise be greatly narrowed due to the <b>outer</b> <b>diameter</b> cone material failing {{to keep up with}} the central voice coil at higher frequencies. The main cone in a whizzer design is manufactured so as to flex more in the <b>outer</b> <b>diameter</b> than in the center. The result is that the main cone delivers low frequencies and the whizzer cone contributes most of the higher frequencies. Since the whizzer cone is smaller than the main diaphragm, output dispersion at high frequencies is improved relative to an equivalent single larger diaphragm.|$|E

25|$|Calipers are {{hand tools}} {{designed}} to precisely measure {{the distance between}} two points.

This is done in order to prevent tire from rubbing against control arms and fenders.|$|E

Three Gorges uses Francis turbines. Turbine diameter is 9.7/10.4m (VGS design/Alstom's design) and rotation speed is 75revolutions per minute.

Rated power is 778 MVA, with a maximum of 840MVA and a power factor of 0.9. The generator produces electrical power at 20kV.

The nostrils were turned upwards, and the nasal bone was a narrow strap that extended up above the eye sockets.

The relative size of the lower jaw was closer to that of tyrannosaurids than to other ornithomimosaurs.

40|$|Conclusions: Provox Vega {{prostheses}} demonstrate good short-term feasibility, {{and their}} optimized airflow-resistance design offers laryngectomy patients indwelling voice prostheses with more choices in <b>outer</b> <b>diameters</b> without sacrificing (too) much in voice quality. Objectives: Technological progress enables improvement of in vitro airflow characteristics of voice prostheses {{and design of}} voice prostheses with smaller <b>outer</b> <b>diameters.</b> This could potentially improve voice quality in users of Provox 2, and avoid diminished voice quality in users of prostheses with smaller <b>outer</b> <b>diameters.</b> Methods: This was a prospective clinical phase I/feasibility study of three newly designed indwelling voice prostheses (Provox Vega 22. 5 (Provox 2 successor), 20, and 17 Fr). Assessments consisted of patients' self-reported voice and speech, perceptual evaluation, acoustic analysis, maximum phonation time, loudness, speech rate, pull-out force and adaptation of the tracheoesophageal (TE) puncture to smaller diameter voice prostheses. Vega 22. 5 was assessed in 15 patients (all Provox ActiValve users, observation period 3 weeks), and 16 patients with Vega 20 / 17 (2 weeks each). Results: No voice prostheses problems were encountered. Half of the patients with Vega 22. 5 preferred that for its better voice quality. Voice and speech were considered equal to Provox 2 for Vega 20, but slightly less for Vega 17. Most TE punctures adapted well to the smaller diameter voice prostheses. <...|$|R
