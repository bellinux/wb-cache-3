To <b>the</b> best <b>of</b> authors’ knowledge, <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modulation <b>diversity</b> technique {{has not been}} evaluated considering the κ-μ fading model. Novel expressions to calculate <b>the</b> PEP <b>of</b> modulation <b>diversity</b> systems subject to κ-μ fading are derived, and they are numerically evaluated and compared. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations were used to evaluate <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modulation <b>diversity</b> technique and to compare communication systems with and without this technique.|$|R

The outage probability and the bit error probability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> delay <b>diversity</b> receiver are accurately derived and {{compared with those}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conventional <b>diversity</b> receiver. From <b>the</b> analytical and numerical results, {{it is confirmed that}} <b>the</b> delay <b>diversity</b> receiver achieves a remarkable diversity gain with reasonable cost and complexity in asynchronous CDMA channels. Specifically, for roughly the same hardware complexity, <b>the</b> delay <b>diversity</b> receiver achieves nearly twice <b>the</b> <b>diversity</b> order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conventional receiver...|$|R

5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diversity</b> within A. cepa occurs {{within this}} group, the most {{economically}} important Allium crop. Plants within this group form large single bulbs, and are grown from seed or seed-grown sets. The majority of cultivars grown for dry bulbs, salad onions, and pickling onions belong to this group. The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod (length of day that triggers bulbing), storage life, flavour, and skin colour. Common onions {{range from the}} pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions, such as the Vidalia from Georgia, USA, or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich.|$|E

However, this research has been controversial, and much publicity has been produced by a study at the Oregon Health and Science University that investigated the mechanisms that produce homosexuality in rams. Organizations such as PETA campaigned against the study, accusing scientists of trying to cure homosexuality in the sheep. OHSU and the involved scientists vehemently denied such accusations.|$|E

Oryzomyini is one of several tribes recognized within the subfamily Sigmodontinae, which encompasses hundreds of species found across South America and into southern North America. Sigmodontinae itself is the largest subfamily of the family Cricetidae, other members of which include voles, lemmings, hamsters, and deermice, all mainly from Eurasia and North America.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cooperative {{diversity}} technique {{refers to}} that in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> multi-users, several single antenna terminals create a virtual multi-antenna system to realize <b>the</b> dispatch and <b>diversity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> periodic line by means of share each other’s antenna. The remarkable strong point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cooperative <b>diversity</b> technique {{is that it can}} reduce <b>the</b> transmission power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system, improve its handing capacity and effectively decrease its error rate. This paper is going to analyze <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cooperative <b>diversity</b> technique on <b>the</b> wireless communication technology and present <b>the</b> main problems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cooperative diversify technique by introducing <b>the</b> related conceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cooperative <b>diversity</b> technique...|$|R

5|$|According to the 2006 Nigerian census, the Enugu {{metropolitan}} area has an estimated population of 722,664. This estimate along with population estimates of other Nigerian cities have been disputed with accusations of population inflation and deflation {{in favour of}} {{the northern part of}} the country. The population of Enugu is predominantly Christian, as is the rest of southeastern Nigeria. Like the rest of Nigeria most people in Enugu speak Nigerian English alongside the dominant language in the region. In this case the dominant language is Igbo. Nigerian English, or pidgin (a mix of English and indigenous words) is often used because of ethnic diversity and sometimes because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diversity</b> of dialects in the Igbo language. In cultural and linguistic terms Enugu is within the Northern cluster of the Igbo region which includes other towns and cities like Awka and Nsukka.|$|E
5|$|Centralized {{order and}} {{oversight}} among the revolt's armed participants {{was difficult to}} establish because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diversity</b> and independence of the rebel factions. A meeting of rebel leaders {{was held in the}} Ghouta village of Saqba on 26 November. Sa'id al-'As accused al-Kharrat and others of plundering in the Ghouta, while al-Kharrat alleged that al-Shallash extorted the residents of al-Midan and the Ghouta town of Douma. The meeting concluded with an agreement to elect a government to replace the French authorities, increase recruitment of the Ghouta's inhabitants, coordinate military operations under a central command, and establish a revolutionary court to execute spies. The meeting also designated the area between the village of Zabdin and north of the Douma-Damascus road as being part of al-Kharrat's zone of operations. Despite his leading role in the rebels' military efforts, al-Kharrat {{was not included in the}} newly formed rebel leadership council, nor were any of al-Bakri's allies. Instead, al-'As served as the rebels' overall head.|$|E
5|$|Peracarid crustaceans, {{including}} isopods, {{are known}} to form {{a significant part of}} the macrobenthic community that is responsible for scavenging on large food falls onto the sea floor. In 2000, scientists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Diversity</b> of the deep Atlantic benthos (DIVA 1) expedition (cruise M48/1 of the German research vessel RV Meteor III) discovered and collected three new species of the Asellota suborder of benthic isopods from the abyssal plains of the Angola Basin in the South Atlantic Ocean. In 2003, De Broyer et al. collected some 68,000 peracarid crustaceans from 62 species from baited traps deployed in the Weddell Sea, Scotia Sea, and off the South Shetland Islands. They found that about 98% of the specimens belonged to the amphipod superfamily Lysianassoidea, and 2% to the isopod family Cirolanidae. Half of these species were collected from depths of greater than 1000meters.|$|E
