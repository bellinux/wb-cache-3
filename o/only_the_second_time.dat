Having lost to Wales at home for <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> in 1905, Scotland repeated the defeat in 1909, losing 3–5 (a penalty to a converted try), {{in a game that}} was noted chiefly for poor refereeing.|$|E

50|$|Azerbaijani entry {{received}} {{votes from}} 34 out of 41 {{countries of the}} Contest, Azerbaijan excluded. Azerbaijan's third place is considered a great success for the country, which participated in <b>the</b> contest <b>only</b> for <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Chiefs fell to 2-12 {{after being}} shutout <b>only</b> for <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> against <b>the</b> Raiders in team history. Because the Raiders (4-10) swept the Chiefs, Kansas City {{clinched}} fourth-place in the AFC West for <b>the</b> <b>second</b> straight year.|$|R
5|$|The {{response}} from the team's management was to suspend four players. The team travelled to Toowoomba, where they defeated the locals 19–0. The Natives included a replacement player for <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time,</b> Henry Speakman, after the suspensions reduced the playing strength of the side. The team then travelled back to New Zealand, and arrived in Invercargill on 5 August.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance {{north of the}} Bahamas showed signs of having a well-defined surface circulation and sufficient wind velocity, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Tammy at 7:30a.m. EDT (1130 UTC) October 5 east of Florida, skipping tropical depression status. This marked <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> that the 'T' name {{has been used to}} name an Atlantic storm since alphabetical naming began in 1950; the other time was for Tanya in 1995 (later on there would be Tomas in 2010 and Tony in 2012).|$|E
5|$|Coates {{reached his}} peak at the 1976 games in Innsbruck. He competed in five events, {{and apart from}} a 25th-place finish in the 500m event, did no worse than 11th in the {{remaining}} four. He came sixth in the 10,000m, eighth in the 1,500m and tenth in the 5,000m. It was <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> that an Australian had placed in the top 10, and remained Australia's best result until 1994. His five skiing compatriots were less productive; they registered in 13 races between them and completed only seven due to crashes and disqualifications, with only one top 30 result.|$|E
50|$|In {{the next}} game, the All-Ireland Semi-Final, Tyrone beat Galway, with an {{emerging}} Peter Canavan leading {{the team with}} a personal tally of 1-07.

50|$|The {{seat was}} highly marginal, having only been won by Labour during the {{previous}} year's Labour landslide by 439 votes, and it had <b>only</b> been <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> Labour had ever taken the constituency. In the ensuing by-election, a large swing to the Conservatives saw their candidate David Lane win by 5,978 votes.|$|R
5|$|Drexler {{retired after}} the season, and the Rockets traded {{to bring in}} Scottie Pippen to take his place. In the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Rockets lost to the Lakers {{in the first round}} of the playoffs. After the 1999 draft, the Rockets traded for the second overall pick Steve Francis from the Vancouver Grizzlies, in {{exchange}} for four players and a first-round draft pick. However, after Houston traded a discontented Pippen to Portland, and Barkley suffered a career-ending injury, the rebuilt Rockets went 34–48 and missed the playoffs, for <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> in 15 years.|$|E
5|$|For Georgia, {{discussion}} {{centered on}} the play-calling duties of assistant coach Mike Bobo. Bobo had been named the temporary offensive coordinator for the Bulldogs after then-assistant coordinator Neil Calloway had been named the new head coach at the University of Alabama-Birmingham. Calloway would remain with the Bulldogs as the offensive line coach during the Chick-fil-A Bowl, but Bobo would take over his role as offensive coordinator for the game. It was <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> that Bobo performed as a play-caller for the Bulldogs, the previous game having come in Georgia's regular-season closer, a 15–12 win against Georgia Tech.|$|E
5|$|In the World Championship, O'Sullivan beat David Gilbert 10–7 in {{the first}} round. After the match, he refused to attend a {{mandatory}} press conference, and also {{refused to talk to}} the tournament broadcasters, the BBC.

In the second round, he lost 12–13 to Barry Hawkins, his first loss against Hawkins in 14 years and <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> in 13 years that he had failed to reach the World Championship quarterfinals.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} time since 2004 and <b>only</b> for <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time,</b> a player didn't reach {{semifinal}} despite having 2-1 Round Robin record.

She would then overtake place in semifinal from eventual champion Williams.|$|R

The Under-20's went on to challenge in the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship.Boco captained Benin in the 2008 African Nations Cup in what was <b>only</b> <b>the</b> country's <b>second</b> <b>time</b> qualifying for <b>the</b> competition, and {{was part of the}} Beninese 2010 African Nations Cup team.|$|R
50|$|Rahman {{composed}} the song much before he swept {{nearly all the}} international music awards for his Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack. He recorded the song in December 2008 and the vocalist was collaborating with Rahman <b>only</b> for <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time.</b> <b>The</b> title of the song {{was the name of}} a pigeon appearing in the movie. The pigeon was a major theme used in the movie.|$|R
5|$|Most of the Bearcats' offense {{came through}} the air, however. Cincinnati quarterback Tony Pike {{finished}} the game having completed 16 of his 33 pass attempts, resulting in 239 passing yards, 1 touchdown, and 4 interceptions. Pike also ran the ball five times for four yards. Pike's four interceptions were a career-high and marked <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> he threw more than one interception in a game. For Virginia Tech, quarterback Tyrod Taylor finished the game with 13 completions from 22 pass attempts, resulting in 140 passing yards and 1 interception. In addition to his passing, Taylor ran with the ball 15 times, gaining 47 {{yards and a touchdown}} in the process.|$|E
5|$|Robinson {{fought for}} the final time in 1965. He lost via {{unanimous}} decision to Joey Archer. Famed sports author Pete Hamill mentioned {{that one of the}} saddest experiences of his life was watching Robinson lose to Archer. He was even knocked down and Hamill pointed out that Archer had no knockout punch at all; Archer admitted afterward that it was <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> he had knocked an opponent down in his career. The crowd of 9,023 at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh gave Robinson several standing ovations, even while he was being thoroughly outperformed by Archer.|$|E
5|$|The Cincinnati Bearcats {{ended the}} 2007 college {{football}} {{season with a}} 10–2 record, including a win in the 2007 PapaJohns.com Bowl over Southern Miss, 31–21. It was <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> in school history that Cincinnati had won 10 games in a season. Before the 2008 season, the Bearcats hoped quarterback Ben Mauk {{would be allowed to}} play an unusual sixth year of college football, a possibility created by a year lost to injury and a redshirt year. After Mauk's request was denied by the NCAA, the annual poll of media covering Big East football picked Cincinnati to finish fifth in the eight-team Big East.|$|E
50|$|The {{competition}} {{began on}} 23 October 2015 with the Qualification round. Al-Oruba SC were the defending champions, having won their fourth title in 2015.

50|$|The Irish Senior Cup was won in 1974-75 and 1975-76, for <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> {{and third}} <b>time</b> in the club’s history. This led to {{qualification}} {{to play in}} the European cup-winners' competition.|$|R
50|$|In 1972-73 Hagan led Benfica {{to become}} the first club in Portugal ever to win the {{championship}} without defeats and won 28 matches - 23 consecutively - out of 30, drawing the other two. In that year Eusébio also became Europe's top scorer with 40 goals, in what was his penultimate season as a Benfica player. The team scored 101 goals, breaking 100 <b>only</b> for <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> in their history.|$|R
5|$|The close loss {{discouraged}} the Virginia Tech players, {{who then}} had only {{five days to}} prepare for their next opponent, lightly regarded James Madison University. At Lane Stadium, Virginia Tech's home field, James Madison upset the heavily favored Hokies, 21–16. The loss was <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> in college football history that a team ranked nationally was defeated by a team from the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision. In {{the wake of the}} loss, Virginia Tech fell from No. 13 to out of the polls entirely.|$|E
5|$|The first trio recording, Trisector, was {{released}} on 17 March 2008.

It was <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> Van der Graaf Generator had visited the United States(their first being in New York City in 1976).|$|E
5|$|After the 1999 draft, the Rockets {{traded for}} the third overall pick Steve Francis from the Vancouver Grizzlies, in {{exchange}} for four players and a first round draft pick. However, after Houston traded a discontented Pippen to Portland (stating chemistry problems with old rival and now teammate Barkley), and Barkley suffered a career-ending injury, the rebuilt Rockets went 34–48 and missed the playoffs, for <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> in 15 years. In the 2000–01 season, the Rockets worked {{their way to a}} 45–37 record, but still did not make the playoffs. In the following offseason, a 38-year-old Olajuwon requested a trade, and, despite stating their desire to keep him, the Rockets reached a sign and trade agreement, sending him to the Toronto Raptors. The proceeding season was unremarkable, as Houston's first season without Olajuwon in almost 20 years finished with a disappointing 28–54 record.|$|E
50|$|The 1985 {{season of}} the Cook Islands Round Cup was the sixteenth {{recorded}} season of top flight association football competition in the Cook Islands, with any results between 1951 and 1969 currently unknown. Arorangi won the championship, their first recorded championship, and <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> recorded <b>time</b> since <b>the</b> inaugural season in 1950 that the title had not been won by Titikaveka, following Avatiu's victory in the 1980 season.|$|R
25|$|England {{were playing}} in the Women's World Cup Final for the fifth time, a mark surpassed only by Australia. However, in the {{preceding}} five tournaments (1997–2013), England had made the final just once, defeating New Zealand in the 2009 final to claim their third World Cup title. India {{on the other hand}} was {{playing in the}} World Cup Final, <b>only</b> for <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> in their history. The first had been a loss to Australia in 2005.|$|R
50|$|The {{championship}} {{was played}} over 3 phases. First phase with all 7 teams, {{followed by a}} play off with the top 4 teams and then a final with the 2 top teams. Matches started at the stadium of Kralendijk but, due to renovations of the pitch, were continued at Antonio Trenidat Stadium in Rincon. With home court advantage both teams of Rincon qualified for the final for <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> in history. Vespo defeated Real Rincon 1-0 to become champion <b>only</b> for <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> in their history.|$|R
5|$|Airbus {{signed a}} {{memorandum}} of understanding with Drukair in July 2003 for two 114-seat Airbus A319-115, powered by two CFM56-5B engines, for delivery {{in the second half}} of 2004. The purchase of the two jets, valued at 3,534.36 million Bhutanese ngultrum (BTN), was the biggest single purchase ever made by Bhutan, and was largely responsible for a 250 percent increase in the Bhutanese trade deficit over the previous year for the financial year 2004–2005. The Bhutanese government issued BTN 1,767.18 million in government bonds to pay for one aircraft and for <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> in Bhutan's history intended to seek a commercial loan for the other aircraft. However, in October 2004 it announced it would instead seek a soft loan for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|Davidson was {{recalled}} for the Fourth Test, {{but managed}} only a wicket as England sealed the series 4–1. However, he {{then took a}} total of 6/68 as New South Wales defeated England; it was <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> the tourists had lost for the summer. Davidson was retained for the final Test, his first on his home ground in Sydney, but was wicketless in a rain-affected draw. His Test series had been poor, with 71runs at 14.20 and only three wickets at 73.33 as England retained the Ashes 3–1. Davidson had not tasted victory in any of his eight Tests. His poor Test form contrasted to his performances against England in tour matches; he took 15 wicket at 15.13 in three matches outside the Tests.|$|E
5|$|Federer's season {{turned around}} in the final masters event of the clay season when he {{defeated}} Nadal on clay for <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> to capture the Madrid Masters. Federer entered the French Open with few predicting him to win the elusive Parisian title having lost to Nadal in the final weekend {{for the past four}} seasons. After Nadal's unexpected defeat to Robin Söderling, Federer suddenly became the overwhelming favorite. It would not be easy as in his next match as he was forced to come from two sets and break point down in the third set to defeat Tommy Haas in five sets. He was also forced to fight back from a two-sets-to-one deficit against a young Juan Martín del Potro to win a five setter in the semifinals. In the final, he faced Söderling, and with a straight sets victory, he finally captured the Coupe des Mousquetaires and career Grand Slam. This victory tied him with Pete Sampras for the most Grand Slam singles titles.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 October 1922, the Metropolitan Museum of Art {{opened to}} the public [...] "Furniture from the Workshop of Duncan Phyfe", the first {{exhibition}} ever held in an art museum on the work of a single cabinetmaker.

40|$|Although the {{upcoming}} UK referendum on EU membership will <b>only</b> be <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> British electorate has voted on its {{participation in the}} integration project, over 50 referendums have been held elsewhere in Europe on other aspects of European integration. Sara Hobolt assesses what lessons these referendums might have for the UK, noting that there are four key characteristics of ballots on the EU: that the campaign matters, party messages are important, the framing of the “reversion point” is crucial, and that EU referendums are {{not just about the}} EU...|$|R
