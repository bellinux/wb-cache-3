The aim was to obtain biosorbent material with an increased concentration of binding sites. The effects of two different extraction procedures (one using only methanol and the other one hexane followed by methanol) on the binding properties of olive pomace were tested by potentiometric titrations and batch biosorption tests for copper and cadmium removal. Titration modelling evidenced that both kinds of extractions generated a solid with a reduced amount of protonatable sites. Biosorption tests were organized according to full factorial designs.

A novel optimization design approach of the processing parameters for the high-speed cutting of the DIN 1. 2344 tool steel has been also proposed. The characteristics indices of cutting performance selected for this investigation are tool life and <b>metal</b> <b>removal</b> rate. The processing parameters include the surface roughness of the relief face of an end-mill, cutting speed, feed per tooth, axial cutting depth, and radial cutting depth. The process is integrated using multiple performance indices. Consequently, the optimal combination of processing parameters is determined by performing grey relational analysis. The analysis results indicate that {{the effect of}} cutting speed and feed per tooth are significant for multiple performance characteristics. Additionally, the surface roughness of the relief face of an end-mill essentially affects the surface roughness of the processed workpiece. Due to a slight effect on the cutting performance characteristics of rough machining, a surface roughness of the relief face of 0. 430. 02 m for grinding conditions can be used to improve tool grinding efficiency.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Urban {{stormwater}} runoff {{contains a}} broad range of pollutants that are transported to natural water systems. A practice known as biological retention (bioretention) has been suggested to manage stormwater runoff from small, developed areas. Bioretention facilities consist of porous soil, a topping layer of hardwood mulch, and a variety of different plant species. A detailed study of the characteristics and performance of bioretention systems for the removal of several heavy metals (copper, lead, and zinc) and nutrients (phosphorus, total Kjeldahl nitrogen [TKN], ammonium, and nitrate) from a synthetic urban stormwater runoff was completed using batch and column adsorption studies along with pilot-scale laboratory systems. The roles of the soil, mulch, and plants in the <b>removal</b> of heavy <b>metals</b> and nutrients were evaluated to estimate the treatment capacity of laboratory bioretention systems. Reductions in concentrations of all metals were excellent (� 90 %) with specific <b>metal</b> <b>removals</b> of 15 to 145 mg/m 2 per event.

The {{aim of this}} investigation was to determine metal adsorption from complex wastewaters onto these peat samples and compare it to the adsorption onto peat granules, clinoptilolite, glauconite and a flue dust from steel production. A sulphide mine leachate, a landfill leachate and a laundry wastewater were chosen, giving a variation in pH, ionic strength, total organic carbon and concentrations of metals. Metal adsorption was determined in batch and column experiments. The wastewater composition was of great importance for <b>metal</b> <b>removal</b> efficiency, mainly due to the difference <b>in</b> dominating <b>metal</b> species. <b>In</b> the sulphide mine leachate, containing free metal ions, a high metal adsorption was observed onto both peat and inorganic adsorbents. In the landfill leachate the metals formed carbonate and organic complexes and a low <b>metal</b> <b>removal</b> was achieved. Contrary to the leachates, the laundry wastewater contained suspended particles. The high amount of metals removed, 80 % of the Cu and 30 - 60 % of the Zn concentration, was probably withdrawn bound to the particle fraction.

40|$|Aims: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the zinc (Zn) and nickel (Ni) removal from aqueous solution by coagulation-flocculation using polyaluminum chloride (PACl) and chitosan (CS) biopolymer. Materials and Methods: This study was a laboratory scale experiment, which used PACl and CS to remove Zn and Ni with concentrations 3 - 100 mg/L from aqueous solutions. Jar test was used to compare the Zn and Ni removal efficiencies of the chemical treatment options using PACl and CS. The dosages used for PACl ranged from 5 to 100 mg/L whereas CS dosages varied between 5 and 75 mg/L. Results: The results showed that optimum coagulant doses and pH were found at 50 - 100 mg/L and 11 for PACl and 20 - 75 mg/L and 11 for CS, respectively, when CS added with PACl led to a better removal efficiency of the metals (more of 99 %). In mixed aqueous solution, the presence of Zn caused increase of Ni removal efficiency and the presence of Ni caused decrease of Zn removal efficacy. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that CS had higher removal efficiency than PACl for removal of Zn and Ni, and also CS as a coagulant aid led to increasing <b>in</b> <b>metal</b> <b>removal...</b>|$|R
