5|$|As {{time went}} on, their props and stage {{equipment}} became increasingly sophisticated.

Due to the vast size of the beach which the Stones performed on (2.5km), sound systems had to be set up in a relay pattern {{down the length of the}} beach, in order to keep the sound in sync with music from the stage; for every 340 metres <b>of</b> <b>beach,</b> the sound had to be delayed an additional second.|$|E

Within 15 minutes of landing at Dog Green on the western end of the beach, A/116 had been cut to pieces, the leaders among the 120 or so casualties, the survivors reduced to seeking cover at the water's edge or behind obstacles. The smaller Ranger company to their right had fared a little better, having made the shelter of the bluffs, but were also down to half strength.|$|E

5|$|L/16 {{eventually}} landed, 30 minutes late, to {{the left}} of Fox Green, taking casualties as the boats ran in and more as they crossed the 200 yards (180m) <b>of</b> <b>beach.</b> The terrain at the very eastern end of Omaha gave them enough protection to allow the 125 survivors to organize and begin an assault of the bluffs. They were the only company in the first wave able to operate as a unit. All the other companies were, at best, disorganized, mostly leaderless and pinned down behind the shingle with no hope of carrying out their assault missions. At worst, they had ceased to exist as fighting units. Nearly all had landed at least a few hundred yards off target, and in an intricately planned operation where each section on each boat had been assigned a specific task, this was enough to throw the whole plan off.|$|E

5|$|Rainfall {{from the}} storm reached over 7inches (175mm) a short {{distance}} east of Pensacola, Florida, though impact in the state was minor. Wind gusts peaked at 38mph (61km/h) in Pensacola. In Alabama, Beryl produced sustained winds of 38mph (61km/h), with gusts to 54mph (86km/h), as well as above normal tides. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in coastal portions of Alabama, peaking at 16.09inches (408mm) on Dauphin Island. Rough waves overturned a shrimp boat in Mobile Bay. A 15-year-old boy on the boat drowned, the only direct fatality {{from the storm}}. The boy's father, also on the boat, spent 24hours in the water before being rescued by the United States Coast Guard. The waves caused severe beach erosion along the coastline, with Dauphin Island losing 60 to 70feet (18 to 21m) <b>of</b> <b>beach.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{bivalves}} are {{a highly}} successful class of invertebrates found in aquatic habitats throughout the world. Most are infaunal and live buried in sediment on the seabed, or in the sediment in freshwater habitats. A large number of bivalve species {{are found in the}} intertidal and sublittoral zones of the oceans. A sandy sea beach may superficially appear to be devoid of life, but often {{a very large number of}} bivalves and other invertebrates are living beneath the surface of the sand.

5|$|The katipo is an {{endangered}} species and has recently become threatened with extinction. It is estimated {{that there are only}} a few thousand katipo left in about 50 areas in the North Island and eight in the South Island, making it rarer than some species of kiwi. A number of reasons have contributed to its decline; the major factors appear to be loss of habitat and declining quality of the remaining habitat. Human interference with their natural habitat has been occurring for over a century following European settlement. Coastal dune modification resulting from agriculture, forestry, or urban development along with recreational activities like the use <b>of</b> <b>beach</b> buggies, off-road vehicles, beach horse riding and driftwood collection have destroyed or changed areas where katipo lives. The introduction of many invasive exotic plants has also contributed to the decline of suitable habitat.|$|E

5|$|The storm {{produced}} rough surf {{along the}} coastline from Florida to North Carolina, causing beach erosion and some damage. In some areas, the waves eroded up to 20feet (6m) <b>of</b> <b>beach,</b> leaving 70homes {{in danger of}} collapse. Offshore North Carolina, high waves of 34feet (10m) and tropical-storm-force winds damaged three boats; their combined nine passengers were rescued by the Coast Guard, although all nine sustained injuries. Light rainfall was also reported in some coastal locations. Damage was minimal, but six people drowned {{as a result of}} the storm.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} geology of the North Norfolk {{coast is}} Cretaceous chalk, exposed at Hunstanton cliffs {{just to the}} west of the SSSI, but buried by soft Quaternary glacial debris for the entire length of the SSSI coast. Unlike the soft, rapidly eroding cliffs further east, the coast of the SSSI has shown a less consistent pattern, with a net accretion <b>of</b> <b>beach</b> material between 1880 and 1950. However, this coastline is threatened by climate change, with sea level rising an estimated 1–2mm per year for the last 100 years, increasing the risk of flooding and coastal erosion.|$|E

Principal photography began on January 11, 2010. A few days after filming began, Clark Gregg signed on to reprise his role from Iron Man and Iron Man 2 as Agent Coulson. In February, Paramount Pictures entered negotiations with Del Mar, California to use a 300-yard stretch <b>of</b> <b>beach</b> to film a scene for Thor involving six horses running down the terrain. Paramount said this coastline was ideal because its gradual slope of sand down to the waterline creates excellent reflective opportunities on film. On March 15, 2010, production of Thor moved to Galisteo, New Mexico where Cerro Pelon Ranch, an old-fashioned Western film town, was extensively modified for the shoot.|$|E
