The method, known as track-based compression (TBC), detects, associates, and tracks moving objects between frames, sending {{only a small}} chip or ID around the moving object once the track has been established. The compression ratio achievable depends on scene content, sensor geometry, {{the degree to which}} the background can be stabilized, and other factors.

40|$|The {{approximate}} {{solution to the}} equation of transfer for optical radiation in the atmosphere above the sea is obtained. For a zeroth approximation derivation of the equation of transfer, a bi-transport representation of the light scattering phase function was used. Already in this approximation an equation for the transmittance of the atmosphere is obtained within an accuracy of about 5 %. The next approximation leads to expressions for radiance factors {{of the sky and}} ocean-atmospheric-layer system, the latter of which, {{in the case of an}} homogeneous atmosphere and not very <b>oblique</b> <b>sensing</b> and solar angles, transforms at the upper boundary of the atmosphere into the well-known formulae used for processing optical satellite data. The results of this study can be used to develop algorithms for processing airborne and shipborne optical information. A significant portion of the signal detected by an airborne optical sensor is due to atmospheric scattering.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{traverses}} have been undertaken across a ca. 45 km {{section of the}} north-south oriented eastern margin of the Tanzanian Craton between Dodoma and Mpwapwa, Central Tanzania. The boundary is a SE-dipping zone of high strain between about 1 and 2 km wide. The rocks of the eastern craton are uniformly composed of coarse-grained, grey, migmatised granodiorite gneisses which are heterogeneous at outcrop scale but are regionally homogeneous. The orthogneisses have no regionally consistent fabric and foliations are variably oriented at outcrop scale. However, there is a gradual increase in strain eastwards towards {{the edge of the}} craton, manifest as an increasingly strong, regionally consistent, E to SE-dipping foliation. This strain increase eventually leads to mylonitic and porphyroclastic planar fabrics and strong, uniformly SE-plunging, linear fabrics. In most structural domains planar fabrics are predominant, but these alternate with minor domains dominated by linear fabrics, with fold mullions locally developed. The kinematics of the high-strain mylonites show a consistent, top-to-the-NW (<b>oblique)</b> <b>sense</b> of movement. The frontal thrust zone grades laterally into steep sinistral and dextral oblique strike-slip shear zones to the north and south respectively. The contact is a single wide deformation zone in the northern and southern segments of the study area, with a more complex imbricate belt in the central part. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} text is {{the first}} chapter of Jacques Derrida’s book Politiques de l’amitié [The Politics of Friendship], being the exemplary and standard case of deconstruction, in this particular case, of philosophical texts (Cicero, P lato and, notably, Aristotle). The starting point for the discussion is the performative contradiction inscribed in the wellknown fragment On friendship from Essays by Michel de Montaigne: “O mes amis, il n’y a nul amy” (O my friends, there is no friend). Apparently, everything here is well-known and obvious, even the very notion of friendship, but as we proceed in the argument provided by Derrida, the obvious becomes less obvious to us and takes on new shades and hues in meaning, acquires new values. What is objective mixes in this fascinating argument with what is subjective. What is friendship? What is friendship today? Is friendship limited to just private sphere of interpersonal relations? The answer to the latter question is, according to Derrida, clearly negative. In the course of his argument he states: “There is no democracy without a community of friends”. This argument provides clues to understand a particular archeology of the notion, revealing <b>oblique</b> <b>senses</b> and contexts of the word “friendship”, its  istory shown from the antiquity to the present day. </p...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring of tectonic {{movements}} along two active faults of Dinaric (NW-SE trending) fault {{system in}} W Slovenia using TM 71 extensiometers {{was set up}} in 2004. After two years ob measurements some clear trends of displacement were developed. The average left-lateral displacement along a crack in the inner fault zone of the Idrija fault in Učja valley is 0. 38 mm/year. Short term (10 months) rates were even greater and reached the value of 0. 54 mm/year. Since the Idrija fault is considered as dextral strike-slip, is the observedleft-lateral displacement explained by local permutation of principle stress axis. In the Ra{a fault monitoring site at the foot of Vremščica Mt. at Košana the average reverse uplift of hanging wall (SW) block of 0. 24 mm/years and left-lateral displacement of 0. 16 mm/year were established. Short term (9 months) vertical displacements reached the value of 0. 53 mm/year. The <b>oblique</b> <b>sense</b> of displacement is in agreement with geological and seismological observations. Since there were no stronger earthquakes in the vicinity and time span of monitoring, no correlations were established with seismic activity.

40|$|Abstract. In a {{dynamical}} {{model for}} {{the origin of the}} Magellanic Clouds and their large orbital angular momenta around the Galaxy, we consider that a primordial gas-rich Andromeda galaxy collided with our similar Galaxy in an <b>oblique</b> <b>sense</b> some 10 Gyr ago and it left the latter following the Hubble expansion law approximately. A huge gaseous halo was hydrodynamically compressed at their closest approach and driven to form a number of dwarf members, including the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), of the Local Group of Galaxies (LGG) and scatter them on the orbital plane of these two mass-dominant galaxies. In order to see the reality of this model, we reexamine the two-dimensional sky distribution of the LGG members and the Magellanic Stream, we confirm an earlier and widely-discussed idea that they align along two similar great circles, each with an angular width of ∼ 30 ◦, and the planes of these circles are approximately normal to the line joining the present position of the sun and the Galactic center. Further we make a three-dimensional distribution map of these objects, and observe it from various directions. A well-defined plane of finite thickness is found, within which most of the member galaxies are confined, supporting the existence of the above circles on the sky. Thus we could determined the orbital elements of M 31 relative to the Galaxy through reproducing the well-studied dynamics of the LMC and SMC around the Galaxy. The expected proper motion of M 31 is (µl, µb) = (38 µas yr − 1, − 49 µas yr − 1).

It uses an innovative multispectral approach (flux tracing, exact kernel, discrete ordinate techniques) over the whole optical domain.

40|$|A {{study of}} the position, nature and geochronology of the eastern margin of the Tanzania Craton near Mpwapwa yields new {{constraints}} on Archaean to Neoproterozoic orogenesis of central Tanzania. The {{eastern part of the}} craton comprises typical Neoarchaean grey granodioritic orthogneisses dated with the LA-ICP-MS method by U–Pb zircon at ca. 2. 7 Ga.

In the west, the group consists of typical “shelf facies” metasedimentary rocks (marbles, calc-silicates, quartzites, etc.).

It uses shoes {{as an object of}} analysis to interrogate the place and function of aesthetic pleasure in critical thinking and cultural practice in the age of globalization and the neoliberal university. Tracking contemporary articulations of the shoe as a popular cultural object, the discussion begins by recalibrating Judith Halberstam’s concept of the "queer art of failure" in terms of what I call an oblique art of shoes. The discussion also revisits Fredric Jameson’s footwear musings in Postmodernism, or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism to elucidate a missing link between aesthetics, affect, and materiality in the critique of popular culture. The article accordingly works with obliqueness in two ways. First, my approach is <b>oblique</b> in the <b>sense</b> that I address {{popular culture and}} the humanities indirectly via the aesthetics and materiality of the shoe. Second, like many popular objects, I find shoes themselves to have an oblique relationship with art and so-called high culture.

40|$|The precise position, {{nature and}} U-Pb zircon geochronology {{of the eastern}} margin of the Tanzania Craton has been studied in the Mpwapwa area, some 60 km east of Dodoma, central Tanzania, {{in a number of}} field transects over a ca. 45 km strike length of the craton margin. The rocks to the east of the Tanzania Craton in this area either belong to the Palaeoproterozoic Usagaran belt, or the “Western Granulite” terrane of the Neoproterozoic East African Orogen, {{according}} to different authors. The eastern part of the craton is underlain by typical Neoarchaean migmatitic grey granodioritic orthogneisses dated by ICP-MS at 2674 ± 73 Ma. There is a gradual increase in strain eastwards in these rocks, culminating in a 1 to 2 km wide, locally imbricated, ductile thrust/shear zone with mylonites indicating an <b>oblique</b> top-to-the-NW, transpressional <b>sense</b> of movement. East of the craton-edge shear zone, a series of high-grade supracrustal rocks are termed the “Mpwapwa Group”, in view of uncertain age and regional lithostratigraphic correlations. There is an apparent east-west lithological zonation of Mpwapwa Group parallel to the craton margin shear zone. In the west, immediately adjacent to the craton, the group consists of typical “shelf facies” metasediments (marbles, calc-silicates, quartzites etc.). U-Pb dating of detrital zircons from two Mpwapwa Group quartzite samples from this marginal zone contain only Archaean detritus, constraining their maximum depositional age to > ca. 2. 6 Ga and suggesting that the group is Neoarchaean in age. The shelf rocks pass eastwards into garnet and kyanite-bearing semi-pelitic gneisses interlayered with bimodal mafic-felsic gneisses, where the mafic amphibolite gneisses may represent meta-basalts and the felsic rocks may have meta-rhyolite, -granite or –psammite protoliths. Massive garnet-clinopyroxene amphibolite layers in the Mpwapwa Group gneisses may have been intrusive mafic sills and possibly correlate with the Palaeoproterozoic Isimani Suite, which outcrops south of the study area and includes 2 Ga eclogites. Zircons from a quartzo-feldsapthic gneiss sample from the bimodal gneisses were dated and showed it to be a probable Neoarchaean rock which underwent metamorphism during the Palaeoproterozoic Usagaran event at ca. 1950 Ma. This event was broadly coeval with subduction, closure of an ocean basin and eclogite formation further south and led to the initial juxtaposition of the two Archaean blocks. The metamorphism probably dates the tectonic event when the Archaean Mpwapwa Group rocks were juxtaposed against the orthogneissic Tanzania Craton. The Mpwapwa Group was intruded by weakly foliated biotite granite at 1871 ± 35 Ma. Zircons in the granite have metamorphic rims dated between 550 and 650 Ma that grew during the East African orogenic event...|$|R
40|$|I. A {{compilation}} of 362 cooling ages, including 52 newly {{reported in this}} study, from nine thermochronometric systems, 40 K/ 39 Ar amphibole, 40 K/ 39 Ar white mica, 87 Rb/ 86 Sr white mica, 40 K/ 39 Ar biotite, 87 Rb/ 86 Sr biotite, zircon and apatite fission track, zircon and apatite (U-Th) /He, indicate that {{the base of the}} Austroalpine allochthonous ‘orogenic lid’ was not in full thermal equilibrium with its Penninic substrate until at least the middle Oligocene, approximately 29 - 28 Ma, to allowably as late as the early Miocene, ca. 18 Ma. There is about a factor-of-five difference in cooling rates between the hanging wall (ca. 4 °C/m. y.) and footwall (ca. 20 °C/m. y.) during this period. In addition, there are demonstrably higher metamorphic grades, including blueschist- and eclogite-facies, in the Pennine footwall compared to lower greenschist-facies in the Austroalpine hanging wall. Together these two facts demonstrate that hot, high-pressure Penninic nappes were forced upward against the cold, low-pressure overriding Austroalpine plate {{in a very short time}} window of approximately 7 - 10 m. y. between the time of peak metamorphism during the Eocene and the time of thermal equilibration with the overriding plate during the Oligo-Miocene. The most likely mechanism to produce such a cold-on-hot juxtaposition is a normal fault, and therefore, we conclude that an important period of nappe emplacement in the Central Swiss Alps occurred concurrently with orogen-perpendicular normal fault motion at the base of the Austroalpine allochthon persisting well into the Oligocene and possibly into the early Miocene, post-dating the 32 - 30 Ma age of the Bergell intrusion. Mesoscopic structural measurements made at the top and bottom of the Pennine zone in eastern Switzerland indicate multiple, spatially heterogeneous directions of movement. At the top, in the Oberhalbstein Valley, movement directions vary from dominantly top-east to top-south-southeast a very minor top-north component within Pennine rocks of the Martegnas shear zone and no preferred movement direction within the Austroalpine hanging wall. Near Piz Toissa, a minimum of two kilometers of nearby structural section in the Err and Platta nappes have been faulted out. At the bottom of the Pennine zone in Val Lumnezia and the Chur Rhein Valley at Trimmis, we observe top-northwest, top-north, and top-northeast movements. In Val Lumnezia, the Sub-Penninic Scopi zone (Gotthard cover rocks) shows movement in a top-northwest direction; the superjacent Peidener imbricate fault zone, a relatively thin (ca. 50 to 100 m thick) structural zone consisting of Scopi zone lithologies, shows movement in a northeasterly direction; above that, the basal Penninic Bündnerschiefer shows no dominant movement direction. To the east, in the Chur Rhine Valley, movement is well defined as exclusively top-north. Therefore, movement directions in the lower Bündnerschiefer are broadly top-north but heterogeneous in direction along strike between Val Lumnezia and Chur Rhein Valley, and, as first suggested by Weh and Frotizheim (2001), it may be erroneous to regard the basal Pennine thrust as a simple through-going structure. In Val Lumnezia, the Scopi-Peidener-Pennine nappes resemble a “jelly sandwich” in which the thick Pennine mass utilized the Peidener zone to move in an <b>oblique</b> sinistral-normal slip <b>sense</b> past the southeast-dipping allochthonous Scopi zone and its east-dipping Gotthard “massif” substrate. If the Peidener zone continues northeastward beneath alluvial cover of the Chur Rhein Valley, it may serve as a late, NE-directed shear zone that separates the Pennine nappes from European units. If so, it would explain the apparent truncation and progressive omission of allochthonous elements of European affinity along the zone from southwest to northeast beneath alluvium of the Chur Rhein Valley. We therefore infer that the direct juxtaposition of Penninic units to the east with the Helvetic autochthon to the west at the latitude of Trimmis records an episode of top-northeast, orogen-parallel strike-slip and extensional movement. Zircon (U-Th) /He (ZHe) cooling ages from the Oberhalbstein Valley indicate that the Austroalpine-Pennine contact was still active at ca. 27 Ma, and that the Martegnas shear zone was active, in part, between ca. 27 and 24 Ma. It is likely that the Piz Toissa klippe formed around this time during the late Oligocene. The pattern of much younger ZHe ages at the bottom of the Pennine zone is independent of any nappe boundaries, including the Peidener imbricate fault zone, but is consistent with the rise of the Aar massif during the Miocene. Tectonic movements, as recorded by the mesostructure in the Austroalpine, Penninic, and Sub-Penninic domains, and local ZHe cooling ages generally support the conclusion drawn strictly from cooling ages that the Pennine zone was emplaced en masse as a coherent ‘piston’ or ‘mega-pip’ during Oligocene to early Miocene time (approximately 29 to 18 Ma), well after juxtaposition of Apulia with cratonic Europe (continent-continent collision) and during the development of Alpine topography and the peripheral basins (viz. Molasse and Lombardi). Additional top-north movement and late uplift and flexure of the nappe stack, along with the Aar massif, occurred primarily in middle to upper Miocene time, following the post-collisional structural interposition of the Pennine zone between Europe and Apulia. II. Nine carbonate phases at Kennecott, Alaska were measured for their clumped isotope (∆ 47) equilibration temperatures. The total range for carbonate temperatures spans 38 - 164 °C. Premineral phases are relatively cool (43 - 71 °C); synmineral phases are relatively warm (89 - 157 °C); late postmineral phases are the most cool (38 - 59 °C) but overlap some premineral phases. Zebra dolomite precipitated in the range 130 - 163 °C. Dedolomite, a hallmark alteration feature of the mineralizing fluids, falls into a narrow range of 98 - 109 °C, consistent with the stability field for the low-temperature chalcocite polymorph. Except for one sample, none of the synmineral calcites crystallized within the stability field of djurleite, a volumetrically significant component of the main-stage ore, which suggests that intergrown djurleite may have been a somewhat later recrystallization product of chalcocite rather than a coeval phase. Calculated compositions for δ 18 O water vary from - 4. 2 to + 11. 0 ‰. The most depleted water precipitated hydrothermal baroque dolomite, whereas the most enriched water was associated with recrystallized limestone wallrock on the periphery of the orebody. Waters that precipitated calcite+copper vary from - 1. 1 to + 9. 3 ‰. Intriguingly, rhythmic layering in zebra dolomite can be resolved in ∆ 47 space, and preliminary data indicate that the coarser-grained baroque dolomite bands precipitated at temperatures 5 - 10 °C cooler than the surrounding, finer-grained dolomite wall rock bands. The calculated values of δ 18 O water support a genetic model that invokes redox changes associated with fluid mixing as the likely mechanism responsible for copper deposition. In this model a sulfidic, basinal fluid having δ 18 O similar to seawater mixes with a cuprous fluid having heavier δ 18 O (5 to 8 ‰) which was derived from the Nikolai Greenstone during prehnite-pumpellyite-facies metamorphism. </p...|$|R
