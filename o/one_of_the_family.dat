25|$|Plastocyanin is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> of blue copper {{proteins}} {{that are involved}} in electron transfer reactions. The copper-binding site is described as distorted trigonal pyramidal. The trigonal plane of the pyramidal base is composed of two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N2) from separate histidines and a sulfur (S1) from a cysteine. Sulfur (S2) from an axial methionine forms the apex. The distortion occurs in the bond lengths between the copper and sulfur ligands. The Cu−S1 contact is shorter (207pm) than Cu−S2 (282pm).|$|E

25|$|GLUD1 (glutamate {{dehydrogenase}} 1) is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> of glutamate dehydrogenases {{that are}} ubiquitous in life, {{with a key}} role in nitrogen and glutamate (Glu) metabolism and energy homeostasis. This dehydrogenase is expressed at high levels in liver, brain, pancreas and kidney, but not in muscle. In the pancreatic cells, GLUD1 is thought to be involved in insulin secretion mechanisms. In nervous tissue, where glutamate is present in concentrations higher than in the other tissues, GLUD1 appears to function in both the synthesis and the catabolism of glutamate and perhaps in ammonia detoxification.|$|E

According to Reggie, they quit playing when he could finally block Cheryl's shots. Miller claims his unorthodox shooting style was developed to arc his shot over his sister's constant shot blocking. The Millers also had a son, Saul, Jr., who became a musician and followed his father in military service.|$|E

25|$|On July 13, {{the kidnappers}} {{contacted}} Sergio Cázares Garza, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> members {{who lived in}} Texas, {{and told him that}} his remaining relatives would be released if the family paid a ransom. Initially, the family said they could only pay a few thousand dollars, but the captors allowed for them to have at least two days to collect more money. In total, the Cázares made four different payments to the kidnappers in Matamoros in a sum of US$100,000. The first one was delivered at a grocery store parking lot and the second one was left behind a fast-food eatery. The kidnappers communicated with the Cázares family that was in hiding in Texas through telephone, and the cash deliveries were made by a trusted employee of the family in Matamoros. Each time the deliveries were made, the Gulf Cartel sent a different envoy to pick up the money from the Cázares at a disclosed location.|$|E
25|$|According {{to federal}} {{investigator}} Rosario G. Sandoval Medina, former high-ranking Gulf Cartel boss Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez confirmed that Cárdenas Vela {{had ordered the}} mass kidnapping. Cárdenas Vela became the regional boss of the Gulf Cartel in Matamoros in March 2011, four {{months prior to the}} mass kidnapping. He was eventually arrested in Texas in October 2011, and the Subprocuraduría Especializada en Investigación de Delincuencia Organizada (SEIDO) federal agency under the directorship of José Cuitláhuac Salinas Martínez promised to form an agreement with U.S. law enforcement to interrogate him about the case. The family, however, expressed their disappointment with both Mexican and U.S. authorities for failing to cooperate. In February 2013, one of the Cázares family members confirmed to the press that legal procedure to interrogate Cárdenas Vela was unfruitful. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> nephews stated that he once saw the vehicles the kidnappers were driving (which were stolen from the Cázares) in Matamoros. He reportedly called the police to let them know, but they were unable to locate the vehicle or the kidnappers.|$|E
500|$|Director/writer Sooraj Barjatya devoted {{one year}} and nine months to the {{screenplay}} of Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!.

Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! then became a loose adaptation of their 1982 production Nadiya Ke Paar. Barjatya used musical numbers to avoid treating some situations in a cliché manner, which resulted in so many songs that there were complaints during initial screenings of the film concerning its length and number of songs. Barjayta's grandfather, company founder Tarachand Barjatya, loved the song [...] "Dhiktana" [...] so much that the film was nearly given that title.|$|E

500|$|David Williams {{from the}} DVD Movie Guide gave Volume <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> Guy a {{positive}} review, {{saying that the}} first season did well in introducing the characters of the series; he ended his review as [...] "If you’re a fan of shows like The Simpsons, South Park, Futurama, or Married... with Children and enjoy your humor topical, dry, and with tongue firmly planted in cheek, then Family Guy is right up your alley". Aaron Beierle of DVD Talk said {{at the end of}} his review, [...] "Often brilliant, extremely witty and darkly hilarious, Family Guy was unfortunately cancelled after Fox bumped it around six or seven different time slots. Fans of the show should definitely pick up this terrific sets , while those who haven't seen it should consider giving it a look. Highly recommended". Josh Wolk of Entertainment Weekly gave volume one a B, saying that [...] "Family Guy Volume One: Seasons 1 & 2 rips through edgy gags, TV references, and fantasy sequences (some of which are hilariously inspired), but Fox's other buffoonish family has none of The Simpsons heart. As Homer and family have shown, a cartoon doesn't always have to be this cartoonish".|$|E
500|$|The surname [...] "Heber" [...] is {{probably}} derived from [...] "Haybergh", a {{hill in the}} Craven district of Yorkshire in north-eastern England, where the Heber family originated. The family held the lordship of the manor of Marton, and was granted a coat of arms {{during the reign of}} Queen Elizabeth I. In 1752 <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family,</b> Richard Heber, received the manor and estate of Hodnet Hall in Shropshire as a bequest from a cousin of his wife. The bequest included patronage of the parish of Hodnet. On Richard Heber's death in 1766 his brother, named Reginald, who had taken Holy Orders and was co-rector of the parish of Malpas in Cheshire, inherited the Shropshire estate. He then became rector of Hodnet, in addition to his share of the Malpas living. This Reginald married twice; the first union, to Mary Baylie, produced a son, Richard Heber, who became a distinguished book collector and was Member of Parliament for Oxford University. The second marriage, after Mary Baylie's death, was to Mary Allanson; it produced two further sons, the elder of whom, born at Malpas on 21 April 1783, was named Reginald after his father.|$|E
500|$|Saint-Saëns {{was elected}} to the Institut de France in 1881, at his second attempt, having to his chagrin been beaten by Massenet in 1878. In July of that year he and his wife went to the Auvergnat spa town of La Bourboule for a holiday. On 28 July he {{disappeared}} from their hotel, and a few days later his wife received a letter from him to say {{that he would not be}} returning. They never saw each other again. Marie Saint-Saëns returned to her family, and lived until 1950, dying near Bordeaux at the age of ninety-five. Saint-Saëns did not divorce his wife and remarry, nor did he form any later intimate relationship with a woman. Rees comments that although there is no firm evidence, some biographers believe that Saint-Saëns was more attracted to his own sex than to women. After the death of his children and collapse of his marriage, Saint-Saëns increasingly found a surrogate family in Fauré and his wife, Marie, and their two sons, to whom he was a much-loved honorary uncle. Marie told him, [...] "For us you are <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family,</b> and we mention your name ceaselessly here." ...|$|E

500|$|After Mal and Peter Asher (A head of Apple Records) saw {{the rock}} band the Iveys perform at London's Marquee Club, Mal {{constantly}} {{suggested that the}} Beatles sign the band to Apples label. This eventually happened in July '68 when the Iveys became the first band to be signed to the label. Some of the first Apple recording sessions were produced by Mal and the band eventually changed their name to Badfinger. Evans: [...] "January 13, 1969: Paul [...] is really cutting down on the Apple staff members. I was elevated to office boy [...] and I feel very hurt and sad inside—only big boys don't cry. Why I should feel hurt and reason for writing this is ego. ...

Loving them as I do, nothing is too much trouble, because I want to serve them. Feel a bit better now—EGO?" [...] Evans' financial problems started to become such a problem that he had to ask Harrison for money: [...] "April 24: [...] "Had to tell George —'I'm broke'.
