5|$|E. coli {{can live}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> variety of {{substrates}} and uses mixed-acid fermentation in anaerobic conditions, producing lactate, succinate, ethanol, acetate, and carbon dioxide.

5|$|Earwigs {{are mostly}} nocturnal and often hide in small, moist crevices during the day, and are active at night, feeding <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> variety of insects and plants.

5|$|Like most spiders, Zygoballus sexpunctatus is an {{opportunistic}} feeder, feeding <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> {{range of}} invertebrate prey.

5|$|Much of the wordplay in {{the book}} stems {{from the use of}} {{multilingual}} puns which draw <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> range of languages.

5|$|Abundant and widespread, A.obovatus occurs <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> {{range of}} soils, favouring soils in the acidic pH range 3.9–5.4. Like most Adenanthos species {{it is common}} on deeply leached {{siliceous}} sandplain sand. It also occurs on gravelly quartz sand derived from rock outcrops, such as on the rocky hillslopes of the Stirling Range. It is rarely found on gravelly lateritic soils. It {{is also one of}} the few Adenanthos species to grow well in moist environments; it will not tolerate seasonal waterlogging—that niche is filled by A.detmoldii—but thrives in damp soils not subject to waterlogging.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in Reykjavík, Fischer gave a press conference. He lived a reclusive life in Iceland, avoiding entrepreneurs {{and others who}} approached him with various proposals. Fischer moved into {{an apartment in the}} same building as his close friend and spokesman, Garðar Sverrisson. Garðar's wife, Kristín Þórarinsdóttir, was a nurse and later looked after Fischer as a terminally ill patient. Garðar's two children, especially his son, were very close to Fischer. Fischer also developed a friendship with Magnús Skúlason, a psychiatrist and chess player who later recalled long discussions with him <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> variety of subjects.|$|E
5|$|An aggressive, {{powerful}} apex predator, the {{silvertip shark}} feeds <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> variety of bony fishes, {{as well as}} eagle rays, smaller sharks, and cephalopods. This species dominates other requiem sharks of equal size when competing for food, and larger individuals are often heavily scarred from conflicts with others of its species. As {{with other members of}} its family, the silvertip shark is viviparous, with females giving birth to one to 11 pups in the summer. Silvertip sharks are regarded as potentially dangerous to humans, as they often approach divers quite closely. This slow-reproducing species is taken by commercial fisheries for its meat, fins, skin, cartilage, and jaws and teeth, which has apparently led to local population declines or extirpations.|$|E
