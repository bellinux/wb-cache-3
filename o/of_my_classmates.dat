[...] The first day at school several <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>classmates</b> came around to suggest that of course I was coming out for football; and although I protested that I {{had never had a}} ball in my hands, they countered with the argument that I was a good sized lump of a boy and would make a fine prospect. [...] So I promised. [...] Well the only preparation necessary was to take an old pair of shoes down to the town cobbler and have some cleats nailed on them. [...] I think the athletic association must have had some football pants, but I do remember distinctly that you had to furnish your own stockings (any color) and an old sweater. [...] Put these on and you were in business. [...] I can’t believe that there were more than 11 candidates out because I made the team the first afternoon. [...] Nor did we have a regular coach. [...] A boy named Fritz Merwin, who I think had played the year before was our coach. [...] If you ask me, he’s the one whose picture ought to be hanging up around there someplace. [...] He didn’t get paid anything, and if a coach ever had an awkward squad of 11 nit-wits, he did. [...] But he was out there every afternoon, early and late teaching us fundamentals instead of fancy razzle-dazzle plays, and in the end it paid off because we won a few games. [...] I can’t remember who we beat, but I do recall, painfully even after this lapse of time, that our friends over at the county seat (Canton, Ohio) took us to the cleaners twice.” ...|$|E

Neither the years nor the difference of sentiment that had led us to range ourselves on opposite sides in the war had lessened my friendship; indeed the attachment formed in early youth was strengthened by my admiration and gratitude for his conduct toward our people in the vicinity of Vicksburg. His considerate and kind treatment of them stood in bright contrast to the course pursued by many Federal officers.|$|R

60|$|As I project {{myself back}} into those days I re-experience the keen joy I {{took in the}} downpour of vivid sunlight, in the {{colorful}} clouds of evening, and in {{the song of the}} west wind harping amid the maple leaves. The earth was new, the moonlight magical, the dawns miraculous. I shiver with the boy's solemn awe in the presence of beauty.

6000|$|It is {{only fair}} to say that I had risen by this time to the dignity of [...] "boughten shirts," [...] linen collars and [...] "Congress gaiters," [...] and my suit {{purchased}} for graduating purposes was of black diagonal with a long tail, a garment which fitted me reasonably well. It was hot, of course, and nearly parboiled me of a summer evening, but I bore my suffering like the hero that I was, in order that I might make a presentable figure in the eyes <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>classmates.</b> I longed for a white vest but did not attain to that splendor.|$|E
60|$|However, I had pondered {{upon this}} scene {{so long and}} had figured my course so exactly that I made all the turns with {{moderate}} degree of grace and succeeded finally in facing my audience without falling up the steps (as several others had done) and so looked down upon my fellows like Tennyson's eagle on the sea. In that instant a singular calm fell over me, I became strangely master of myself. From somewhere above me a new and amazing power fell upon me and in that instant I perceived on the faces <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>classmates</b> a certain expression of surprise and serious respect.

We went to school with shirts of the Sandinista National Liberation Front and played games of [...] "popular war". And above all, we believed that some day we would have a revolution, whatever it was that. But when I returned to Peru, there was already a revolution under way: The Shining Path, and it was not nice. It was made of blackouts, fear, bombs and dead people."

60|$|In {{the free}} {{air of the}} Middle Border, this man's genius for inventing had full power of expansion, and in result he was in {{possession}} of a fortune, whilst I, in my literary way, had won what my kindest critics called success--by another kind <b>of</b> service. <b>My</b> position though less secure and far less remunerative, was none the less honorable--that I shall insist on saying even though I must admit that in the eyes <b>of</b> <b>my</b> Seminary <b>classmates</b> the inventor made the handsomer showing. As the owner of a patent bringing in many thousands of dollars per year in royalty he had certain very definite claims to respect which I lacked. My home in contrast with his would have seemed very humble. Measured by material things, his imagination had proved enormously more potent than mine.|$|R

I must have called upon some <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>classmates,</b> but I cannot lay hold upon a single word or look or phrase from any of them. Deeply as I felt my distinction in thus riding forth into the world, all the tender incidents of farewell are lost to me. Perhaps my boyish self-absorption prevented me from recording outside impressions, for the idea of travelling, of crossing the State line, profoundly engaged me. Up to this time, notwithstanding all my dreams of conquest in far countries, I had never ridden in a railway coach! Can you wonder therefore that I trembled with joyous excitement as I paced the platform next morning waiting for the chariot of my romance? The fact that it was a decayed little coach {{at the end of a}} [...] "mixed accommodation train" [...] on a stub road did not matter. I was ecstatic.|$|E
6000|$|My {{regular school}} {{training}} {{was of the}} briefest, perhaps fortunately, for though my way of life has made me acquainted with all sorts and conditions of men, from the highest to the lowest, I deliberately affirm that the society I fell into at school was the worst I have ever known. We boys were average lads, with much the same inherent capacity for good and evil as any others; {{but the people who}} were set over us cared about as much for our intellectual and moral welfare as if they were baby-farmers. We were left to the operation of the struggle for existence among ourselves, and bullying was the least of the ill practices current among us. Almost the only cheerful reminiscence in connection with the place which arises in my mind is that of a battle I had with one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>classmates,</b> who had bullied me until I could stand it no longer. I was a very slight lad, but there was a wild-cat element in me which, when roused, made up for lack of weight, and I licked my adversary effectually. However, one of my first experiences of the extremely rough-and-ready nature of justice, as exhibited by the course of things in general, arose out of the fact that I--the victor--had a black eye, while he--the vanquished--had none, so that I got into disgrace and he did not. We made it up, and thereafter I was unmolested. One of the greatest shocks I ever received in my life was to be told a dozen years afterwards by the groom who brought me my horse in a stable-yard in Sydney that he was my quondam antagonist. He had a long story of family misfortune to account for his position, but at that time it was necessary to deal very cautiously with mysterious strangers in New South Wales, and on inquiry I found that the unfortunate young man had not only been [...] "sent out," [...] but had undergone more than one colonial conviction.|$|E

40|$|The {{impetus for}} this {{dissertation}} originated {{from my own}} work placement experience. I was in a multi-disciplinary work environment that traditionally hired only engineering students who needed to complete their work experience requirement. After a summer of working with engineering undergraduates, I {{became aware of the}} strict requirements imposed on them and realised the School of Surveying approach was lacking coordination. My thoughts on this were exacerbated by the lack <b>of</b> significance <b>my</b> <b>classmates</b> attributed to the work experience. As such, my aim was to identify the perceptions the three main stakeholders; students, employers and staff, have on the work placement scheme. I was aware that any differences in expected outcomes would lead to stakeholder dissatisfaction, which may prevent parties from capitalising on work placement opportunities. The results of a questionnaire study were used to identify the stakeholder perceptions on the work placement scheme. It was found the School of Surveying needs to identify why they have the work experience requirement in their formal degree structure. Once this is identified, the scheme can be assigned goals and objectives {{that can be used to}} create a programme that delivers stakeholder expectations. The study concludes with a set of recommendations for each stakeholder on how they can make the most of the work placement programme...|$|R
