40|$|We {{present a}} series of related robust {{optimization}} models for placing sensors in municipal water networks to detect contaminants that are maliciously or accidentally injected. We formulate sensor placement problems as mixedinteger programs, for which the objective coefficients are not known with certainty. We consider a restricted absolute robustness criteria that is motivated by natural restrictions on the uncertain data, and we define three robust optimization models that differ in how the coefficients in the objective vary. Under one set of assumptions there exists a sensor placement that is optimal for all admissible realizations of the coefficients. Under other assumptions, we can apply sorting to solve each worst-case realization efficiently, or we can apply duality to integrate the worst-case outcome and have one integer program. The most difficult case is where the objective parameters are bilinear, and we prove its complexity is NP-hard, even under very simplifying assumptions. We consider a relaxation that provides a tight approximation, giving an <b>overall</b> <b>guarantee</b> of near optimality when used with branch-and-bound search. 1 INTRODUCTION 1...|$|E
40|$|Differential privacy has {{recently}} {{emerged as the}} de facto standard for private data release.

40|$|Abstract — Differential privacy has {{recently}} {{emerged as the}} de facto standard for private data release. This {{makes it possible to}} provide strong theoretical guarantees on the privacy and utility of released data. While it is well-understood how to release data based on counts and simple functions under this guarantee, it remains to provide general purpose techniques that are useful for a wider variety of queries. In this paper, we focus on spatial data, i. e., any multi-dimensional data that can be indexed by a tree structure. Directly applying existing differential privacy methods to this type of data simply generates noise. We propose instead the class of “private spatial decompositions”: these adapt standard spatial indexing methods such as quadtrees and kd-trees to provide a private description of the data distribution. Equipping such structures with differential privacy requires several steps to ensure that they provide meaningful privacy guarantees. Various basic steps, such as choosing splitting points and describing the distribution of points within a region, must be done privately, and the guarantees of the different building blocks must be composed into an <b>overall</b> <b>guarantee.</b> Consequently, we expose the design space for private spatial decompositions, and analyze some key examples. A major contribution of our work is to provide new techniques for parameter setting and post-processing of the output to improve the accuracy of query answers.

40|$|Abstract. The main {{components}} of a decision support system (DSS) developed to support {{the management of the}} water resource system of Athens are presented. The DSS includes information systems that perform data acquisition, management and visualisation, and models that perform simulation and optimisation of the hydrosystem. The models, which are the focus of the present work, are organised into two main modules. The first one is a stochastic hydrological simulator, which, based on the analysis of historical hydrological data, generates simulations and forecasts of the hydrosystem inputs. The second one allows the detailed study of the hydrosystem under alternative management policies implementing the parameterisation-simulation-optimisation methodology. The mathematical framework of this new methodology performs the allocation of the water resources to the different system components, keeping the number of control variables small and thus reducing the computational effort, even for a complex hydrosystem like the one under study. Multiple, competitive targets and constraints with different priorities can be set, which are concerned among others, with the system reliability and risk, the overall average operational cost and the <b>overall</b> <b>guaranteed</b> yield of the system.

40|$|A {{tracking}} problem is {{considered for a}} Wiener model. A two-layer hierarchical control structure is designed: the upper level controller operates at a slow rate and computes the inputs to be ideally provided to the system; the effective control actions are provided by actuators placed at the lower layer and having faster dynamics. Model predictive control (MPC) laws are synthesized for both layers. In order {{to cope with the}} discrepancy between the ideal and the effective control action, a robust MPC controller is designed at the upper level. Such a controller can switch among different operating conditions ensuring different level of robustness. In doing so, the <b>overall</b> controller <b>guarantees</b> steady-state zero error regulation for constant reference signals while trading off robustness versus system performance.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{approach}} supervisory control as an online decision problem. In particular, we introduce “calibrated forecasts ” {{as a mechanism}} for controller selection in supervisory control. The forecasted event {{is whether or not}} a controller will be effective over a finite implementation horizon. Controller selection is based on using the controller with the maximum calibrated forecast of the reward. Assuming the existence of a stabilizing controller within the set of candidate controllers, we show that under the proposed supervisory controller, the output of the system remains bounded for any bounded disturbance, even if the disturbance is chosen in an adversarial manner. The use of calibrated forecasts enables one to establish <b>overall</b> performance <b>guarantees</b> for the supervisory scheme even though non-stabilizing controllers may be persistently selected by the supervisor because of the effects of initial conditions, exogenous disturbances, or random selection. The main results are obtained for a general class of system dynamics and specialized to linear systems. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{hierarchical}} model predictive control (MPC) strategy that <b>guarantees</b> <b>overall</b> system stability. This method differs significantly from previous approaches to <b>guaranteeing</b> <b>overall</b> stability, which have relied upon a multi-rate framework where the inner loop (low level) is updated {{at a faster}} rate than the outer loop (high level), and the inner loop must reach a steady-state within each outer loop time step. In contrast, the method proposed in this paper is aimed at stabilizing the origin of an error system characterized by the difference between the inner loop state and the state specified by a full-order reference model. This makes the method applicable to systems with reduced levels of time scale separation. This paper proposes a framework for guaranteeing stability that leverages the use of the reference model, in conjunction with lambda-contractive constraint sets for both the inner and outer loops. The effectiveness of the proposed reference model-based strategy is shown through simulation on an existing stirred tank reactor problem, where we demonstrate that the MPC optimization problem remains feasible and that the system remains stable and continues to perform well when time scale separation between the inner and outer loops is reduced.
