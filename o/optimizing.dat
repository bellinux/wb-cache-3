40|$|Abstract. Analysis of {{secondary}} structure transition {{is important for}} designing bistable DNA/RNA molecules. To make reliable molecular ma-chines out of such molecules, {{it is necessary to}} estimate the height of the energy barrier to the structure transition. This paper suggests three kinds of <b>optimized</b> transition path: the locally <b>optimized</b> direct path, the glob-ally <b>optimized</b> direct path, and the globally <b>optimized</b> path. These paths can be used as criteria for evaluating structure transitions. Then, we in-troduce algorithms to obtain or approximate these <b>optimized</b> paths. The algorithm that Morgan and Higgs used to obtain the globally <b>optimized</b> direct path is analyzed and improved as an algorithm on a bipartite graph.

The second navigation, around the aircraft, allows the robot to position itself at control points referenced in the aircraft virtual model. In addition, the robot must insert itself in a dynamic environment where humans and vehicles are moving. To address this problem, it has an obstacle avoidance module. Many navigation algorithms are constantly running on the robot with real time constraints. Searches are conducted on <b>optimizing</b> the computing time.|$|E
5|$|Toxic {{peptides}} from Amanita {{species have}} been widely used in biological research as chemical agents to inhibit RNA polymerase II, an enzyme essential for protein synthesis. However, these toxic peptides can only be obtained from fruit bodies collected from natural habitats, and are consequently expensive. Some success has been reported in extracting peptide toxins directly from the mycelia of Amanita exitialis grown in liquid culture. Although the toxin concentration in the mycelium is only about 10% of that in fruiting bodies, the authors suggest that is possible to increase the amatoxin production by <b>optimizing</b> the growth conditions.|$|E
