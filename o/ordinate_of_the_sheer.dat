40|$|We {{consider}} <b>the</b> non-trivial zeros <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riemann ζ-function and {{two classes}} of L-functions; Dirichlet L-functions and those based on level one modular forms. We show that there are an infinite number <b>of</b> zeros on <b>the</b> critical line in one-to-one correspondence with <b>the</b> zeros <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cosine function, and thus enumerated by an integer n. From this it follows that <b>the</b> <b>ordinate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> n-th zero satisfies a transcendental equation that depends only on n. Under weak assumptions, we show that <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> solutions of this equation already saturates the counting formula on the entire critical strip. We compute numerical solutions of these transcendental equations and also its asymptotic limit <b>of</b> large <b>ordinate.</b> <b>The</b> starting point is an explicit formula, yielding an approximate solution for <b>the</b> <b>ordinates</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> zeros in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lambert W-function. Our approach is a novel and simple method, {{that takes into account}} L, to numerically compute non-trivial zeros <b>of</b> L-functions. <b>The</b> method is surprisingly accurate, fast and easy to implement. Employing these numerical solutions, in particular for the ζ-function, we verify that the leading order asymptotic expansion is accurate enough to numerically support Montgomery's and Odlyzko's pair correlation conjectures, and also to reconstruct the prime number counting function. Furthermore, <b>the</b> numerical solutions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exact transcendental equation can determine <b>the</b> <b>ordinates</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> zeros to any desired accuracy. We also study in detail Dirichlet L-functions and the L-function for the modular form based on the Ramanujan τ-function, which is closely related to the bosonic string partition function.

In order to reduce <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> design variables, <b>the</b> upper and lower surfaces of a reference airfoil are, respectively, fitted by using two B-spline curves with only four control points each. By using <b>the</b> <b>ordinates</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eight control points as design variables, <b>the</b> ranges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design variables are set and the airfoil is parameterized.
