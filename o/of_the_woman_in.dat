5|$|In 1924 Hepburn {{gained a}} place at Bryn Mawr College. She {{attended}} the institution primarily to satisfy her mother, who had studied there, and recalled disliking the experience. It {{was the first time}} she had been in school for several years, and she was self-conscious and uncomfortable with her classmates. She struggled with the scholastic demands of university, and once was suspended for smoking in her room. Hepburn was drawn to acting, but roles in college plays were conditional on good grades. Once her marks had improved, she began performing regularly. She performed the lead role in a production <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Woman</b> <b>in</b> the Moon in her senior year, and the positive response it received cemented Hepburn's plans to pursue a theatrical career. She graduated with a degree in history and philosophy in June 1928.|$|E

25|$|Corday's action aided in {{restructuring}} the private versus public role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> {{society at the}} time. The idea of women as worthless beings was challenged, and Corday was considered a hero {{to those who were}} against the teachings of Marat. There have been suggestions that her act incited the banning of women's political clubs, and the executions of female activists such as the Girondist Madame Roland.|$|E

25|$|The artist Susan Dorothea White has {{interpreted}} the masculine proportions of Mona Lisa's cranial architecture in her anatomical artworks Anatomy of a Smile: Mona's Bones (2002) and Mona Masticating (2006).

However, the drawing on which Schwartz based the comparison may not be a self-portrait.|$|E

25|$|The {{success and}} demand for Kngwarreye's {{paintings}} caused her many problems within the community {{as she tried to}} maintain her individual identity. The myth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> her 80s who had never been outside the central desert becoming a great painter was one reason for her popularity. She had in fact, been to Perth, Adelaide, Sydney and Canberra, though this was only after she had become famous. There was much pressure from the white community for her to paint in a certain way, when they believed that one of her styles was more successful than others.|$|E

500|$|Almost {{every aspect}} of the {{advertisement}} was criticized.

She also believed that the image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> the advertisement had been overtly sexualized which she thought was objectifying of women in general.

500|$|McCain's 1992 {{re-election}} campaign found his opposition split between Democratic community {{and civil rights}} activist Claire Sargent and impeached and removed former Governor Evan Mecham running as an independent. Although Mecham garnered some hard-core conservative support, Sargent's campaign never gathered momentum and the Keating Five affair did not dominate discussion. [...] Sargent, who had a failed race for the Arizona Legislature in her background, was slow getting her campaign underway and, although 1992 was the Year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Woman</b> <b>in</b> American politics, failed to get the endorsement of organizations such as Emily's List. [...] McCain outspent Sargent, $3 million to $350,000.|$|E

In tandem with the theme, AMPAS gathered 67 female Oscar winners of every category for a photo that was later shown {{at the start of}} the telecast. Actress and singer Liza Minnelli performed [...] "Ladies' Day", a song written by Fred Ebb and John Kander specifically for the broadcast.

Fed up with the chaos, Liz sends the entire show's staff—including Kenneth and Dr. Spaceman—to her office. Liz ponders over a box of matches and thinks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> court, in which she admitted to committing arson as a way of getting back at her out-of-control employees.

500|$|Susan Hill herself did {{not like}} some of the changes that Kneale had made to The Woman in Black. It has been {{observed}} that Kneale on some occasions operated a double-standard with adaptations; being unhappy when others made changes to his stories, but willing to make changes to stories he was adapting into script form. Referring to The Woman in Black adaptation, the writer and critic Kim Newman noted that: [...] "He was very offended at the notion of Susan Hill using the name of Kipps from HG Wells as the hero <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Woman</b> <b>in</b> Black, and so he decided not to use it and to change the hero's name to Kidd. I'm sure if somebody thought that Quatermass was a silly name and changed it, he'd be furious!" [...] However, Kneale's adaptations were by no means always unpopular with the original author. In 1991, a four-part version he wrote of Kingsley Amis's novel Stanley and the Women, met with approval from the original author, with Amis regarding it as the most successful adaptation of any of his work.|$|E

Additionally, Will Yun Lee was cast as Harada, and Brian Tee as Noburo Mori. By July 2012, Deadline.com said Jessica Biel would play Viper. However, at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International, Biel said {{her role in}} the film was [...] "not a done deal", explaining, [...] "People keep talking about this. I don't know {{anything}} about it. It's a little bit too soon for that kind of an announcement". A few days later, negotiations between Biel and 20th Century Fox had broken down. Later in July, Fox had begun talks with Svetlana Khodchenkova to take over the role. Somewhat unusually for action movies, The Wolverine features four female lead roles and [...] "passes the Bechdel Test early and often", according to Vulture. Mangold noted that he wrote his heroines so that [...] "they all have missions.

500|$|Sophie Muller {{directed}} the music video for [...] "Love Is a Camera", which {{was released on}} 30 May 2014. The video commences with Ellis-Bextor, who impersonates an [...] "eerie temptress" [...] {{dressed in a black}} [...] "ankle-length, lace-trimmed" [...] gown, walking and dancing slowly inside a classical mansion. Exploring the divisions of her house, she starts adjusting picture frames, which hold monochromatic photographs of individuals. One of those pictures depicts a short-haired woman, dressed in white—also played by Ellis-Bextor—who starts mimicking the song, whilst in the frame. The story <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> the frame is told throughout the video—after crossing a field, she finds the mansion. Her photograph is taken by the dressed-in-black Ellis-Bextor, and she is trapped in the frame. Whilst walking down a staircase, the [...] "temptress" [...] passes by a bearded man who stares at her interestingly. Both enter the mansion, where they drink; the dressed-in-black Ellis-Bextor holds his hand. She convinces him to take his photograph, and after realizing it is a trap, he tries to escape. However, the [...] "temptress" [...] finds him running and takes his photograph; trapping him in a frame as well.|$|E
500|$|The {{identity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> {{the bed is}} not known, but {{the archaeologists}} who excavated the site have suggested that she was [...] "a female member of the local aristocracy, probably a princess and an outsider, whose personal status {{was strong enough to}} act as a catalyst for the site" [...] and that her companions were similarly [...] "a group of people of high status from outside the region." [...] Average life expectancy at the time was short– only 32years for men and 28years for women– so {{it is possible that the}} cemetery was used exclusively by members of the [...] "princess's" [...] community and ceased to be used when the last member died. This would fit with its short period of usage, perhaps only 30years or so, judging from the age of the artefacts found during the excavations. Steve Sherlock, the site's discoverer, believes that she was buried first and that the other graves were dug around hers afterward. Next to her grave is a probable male grave, to which it may be linked. The close proximity of the graves and their offset from the rest of the graves in the cemetery raises questions about whether the occupants were related.|$|E
