5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether the {{operations}} were successful, due {{to the complexity of}} their execution, poor weather, and lack <b>of</b> <b>response</b> from German forces. It is possible that they contributed to the overall confusion of D-Day as part of the wider Bodyguard plan.|$|E
5|$|Breastfeeding causes {{negative}} feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending {{on the strength}} of the {{negative feedback}}, breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development, but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycle may resume. Suppression of ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently. The production of prolactin in response to suckling is important to maintaining lactational amenorrhea. On average, women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen and a half months postpartum. There is a wide range <b>of</b> <b>response</b> among individual breastfeeding women, however, with some experiencing return of menstruation at two months and others remaining amenorrheic for up to 42 months postpartum.|$|E

5|$|Detractors of {{the flag}} movement, {{including}} Motilal Nehru, soon hailed the Swaraj flag {{as a symbol of}} national unity. Thus, the flag became a significant structural component of the institution of India. In contrast to the subdued responses of the past, the British Indian government took greater cognisance of the new flag, and began to define a policy <b>of</b> <b>response.</b> The British parliament discussed public use {{of the flag}}, and based on directives from England, the British Indian government threatened to withdraw funds from municipalities and local governments that did not prevent the display of the Swaraj flag. The Swaraj flag became the official flag of Congress at the 1931 meeting. However, by then, the flag had already become the symbol of the independence movement.|$|E
5|$|Hormonal {{therapy is}} only {{beneficial}} in {{certain types of}} endometrial cancer. It was {{once thought to be}} beneficial in most cases. If a tumor is well-differentiated and known to have progesterone and estrogen receptors, progestins may be used in treatment. About 25% of metastatic endometrioid cancers show a response to progestins. Also, endometrial stromal sarcomas can be treated with hormonal agents, including tamoxifen, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, letrozole, megestrol acetate, and medroxyprogesterone. This treatment is effective in endometrial stromal sarcomas because they typically have estrogen and/or progestin receptors. Progestin receptors function as tumor suppressors in endometrial cancer cells. Preliminary research and clinical trials have shown these treatments to have a high rate <b>of</b> <b>response</b> even in metastatic disease.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the {{engineering}} structures, the design parameters may be uncertain {{because of the}} manufacture errors and inaccuracy in measurement, etc. The uncertainties of structural parameters may lead to large and unexpected excursion <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> {{that may lead to}} drastic reduction in accuracy and precision of the operations. Uncertainties in the design parameters are often considered to ensure that the structure is robust with respect to response errors. The paper discusses the robustness <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> structures with uncertainties, which are described with three models, the random, convex, and interval models. The three corresponding methods for estimating the upper and lower bounds <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> are given, and the upper bounds <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> are used to estimate the robustness <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> the structure with uncertain parameters.

5|$|Several agencies, {{including}} the Federal Highway Administration and the City of Oklahoma City have evaluated the emergency response actions to the bombing, and have proposed {{plans for a}} better response in addition to addressing issues that hindered a smooth rescue effort. Because of the crowded streets, and the number <b>of</b> <b>response</b> agencies sent to the location, communication between government branches and rescue workers was muddled. Groups were unaware of the operations others were conducting, thus creating strife and delays in the search and rescue process. The City of Oklahoma City, in their After Action Report, declared that better communication and single bases for agencies would better the aid of those in disastrous situations.|$|E
25|$|Variable Ratio Schedule (VR): A {{procedure}} in which reinforcement comes {{after a number}} <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> that is randomized from one reinforcement to the next (ex. slot machines).

40|$|Two pigeons {{were trained}} to peck either <b>of</b> two <b>response</b> keys for food, under two {{different}} variable-interval schedules. When responding stabilized, the schedule on the left key (reinforcement-key) was changed to a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rates schedule, and responses on the right key (extinction-key) were no longer reinforced. The mean interresponse time <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> on the reinforcement-key approximated the temporal requirement of the reinforcement schedule on that key. Collateral responding on the extinction-key was maintained {{by one of the}} birds. A “run” <b>of</b> these collateral <b>responses</b> was defined as a sequence <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> on the extinction-key occurring between two responses on the reinforcement-key. For this one bird, collateral behavior, measured by mean time per run and mean number <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> per run, was an increasing function of the temporal requirements of the reinforcement schedule on the reinforcement key, and it was strongly positively correlated with the mean interresponse time <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> on the reinforcement-key.

40|$|In Experiment 1, autoshaping trials {{terminated}} {{with food}} only if pigeons emitted {{more than a}} target number <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> during a trial in one condition and fewer than a target number in another.

The responding of yoked-control birds that received response-independent reinforcers did not vary with the response requirements. In Experiment 2, the number <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> in autoshaping trial became the discriminative stimulus for reinforcement in the second component of a chained schedule. In one condition, responding was reinforced only if the number <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> in the first component was above a target value; in the other condition, responding was reinforced only if the number was below the target value. The distribution <b>of</b> the first-component <b>response</b> numbers did not shift systematically between discrimination conditions, but response rates in the second component indicated that the number <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> in the autoshaping trial was a discriminable property behavior...|$|R

5|$|The {{rift between}} Khrushchev's Soviet {{government}} and North Vietnam was clearly obvious in August 1964, when the Soviet Union responded {{in a relatively}} muted fashion after the U.S. conducted air strikes against North Vietnamese Navy bases {{in retaliation for the}} Tonkin Gulf incident. Despite the Soviets’ lack <b>of</b> <b>response,</b> the North Vietnamese leadership restrained itself from criticizing the Soviet government, as they were still hoping that Khrushchev would supply North Vietnam with the anti-aircraft weapons required to defend against further U.S. air attacks. However, the event which occurred in Moscow in October 1964 worked in North Vietnam's favor, as Khrushchev was removed from power. Keen to counteract Chinese influence in the region, a new Soviet government led by Alexei Kosygin sought to end a defense pact with North Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Males’ {{differential}} {{recognition of}} local and nonlocal songs has been studied in two populations: one in the northern United States (New Hampshire) {{and the other in}} the southern United States (North Carolina). An asymmetry <b>of</b> <b>response</b> has been found between the two populations. The northern black-throated blue warbler responds strongly to local songs but relatively weakly to the song of southern warblers. In contrast, a warbler from the south responds equally to songs from both the north and the south. A potential explanation of this asymmetry is the difference in female preference between the northern and southern black-throated blue warblers. Females from the north are less likely to mate with a “heterospecific” male from the south; therefore it is not necessary for a northern male to respond strongly to the song of a southern challenger. It is possible that a barrier to gene flow from south to north exists while a barrier to the reverse does not. Therefore, female choice of male songs is likely {{to play a role in}} gene flow and reproductive isolation, which may eventually lead to diversification.|$|E
