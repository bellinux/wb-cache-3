She was signed by Universal Studios, where her first picture, Three Smart Girls, was so successful that it saved Universal from bankruptcy.|$|E

40|$|Transcription <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clpP-clpX operon <b>of</b> Escherichia coli {{leads to}} <b>the</b> {{production}} <b>of</b> two different sizes of transcripts. In log phase, <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> longer transcript {{is higher than}} <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shorter</b> transcript. Soon after <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> carbon starvation, <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shorter</b> transcript increases significantly, and <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> longer transcript decreases. The longer transcript consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire clpP-clpX operon, whereas <b>the</b> <b>shorter</b> transcript contains <b>the</b> entire clpP gene but none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clpX coding sequence. The RpoH protein {{is required for the}} increase in <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shorter</b> transcript during carbon starvation. Primer extension experiments suggest that there is increased usage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ς 32 -dependent promoter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clpP-clpX operon within 15 min after <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> carbon starvation. Expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clpP-clpX operon from <b>the</b> promoters upstream <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clpP gene decreases to a very low level by 20 min after <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> carbon starvation. Various pieces of evidence suggest, though they do not conclusively prove, that production <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shorter</b> transcript may involve premature termination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> longer transcript. <b>The</b> half-life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shorter</b> transcript is much less than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> longer transcript during carbon starvation. E. coli rpoB mutations that affect transcription termination efficiency alter <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shorter</b> clpP-clpX transcript to the longer transcript. The E. coli rpoB 3595 mutant, with an RNA polymerase that terminates transcription with lower efficiency than the wild type, accumulates a lower percentage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shorter</b> transcript during carbon starvation than does the isogenic wild-type strain. In contrast, the rpoB 8 mutant, with an RNA polymerase that terminates transcription with higher efficiency than the wild type, produces a higher percentage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shorter</b> clpP-clpX transcript when E. coli is in log phase. These and other data are consistent with the hypothesis that <b>the</b> <b>shorter</b> transcript results from premature transcription termination during production <b>of</b> <b>the</b> longer transcript...|$|R

5|$|Polonium is a {{very rare}} element in nature because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> {{half-life}} of all its isotopes. 210Po, 214Po, and 218Po appear in the decay chain of 238U; thus polonium {{can be found in}} uranium ores at about 0.1mg per metric ton (1 part in 1010), which is approximately 0.2% of the abundance of radium. The amounts in the Earth's crust are not harmful. Polonium has been found in tobacco smoke from tobacco leaves grown with phosphate fertilizers.|$|E

5|$|After the {{discovery}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> pulsed electric arc in 1800 by Humphry Davy {{and of the}} continuous electric arc in 1802 by Vasily Petrov, arc welding developed slowly. C. L. Coffin had the idea of welding in an inert gas atmosphere in 1890, {{but even in the}} early 20th century, welding non-ferrous materials such as aluminum and magnesium remained difficult because these metals react rapidly with the air and result in porous, dross-filled welds. Processes using flux-covered electrodes did not satisfactorily protect the weld area from contamination. To solve the problem, bottled inert gases were used {{in the beginning of the}} 1930s. A few years later, a direct current, gas-shielded welding process emerged in the aircraft industry for welding magnesium.|$|E

5|$|Anderson {{initially}} {{intended it}} to be a stand-alone short film, but shortly before filming commenced, he realized that Schwartzman's character bore a close resemblance to one of the protagonists of a feature film he was writing at the time. That film would begin production a year later as The Darjeeling Limited. Chevalier takes place two weeks before Schwartzman's character (named Jack Whitman in the feature) joins his two older brothers on a journey in India in Darjeeling. The dialogue between the characters at the end of Chevalier is recounted by Schwartzman's character to his brothers {{at the close of the}} feature film, in the form of an excerpt from a short story he has composed. Portman's character has a brief cameo in the feature. Fox Searchlight Pictures, the studio that backed Darjeeling, was unaware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> until the feature had been made and claimed to have no financial interest in it.|$|E
5|$|Aram Avakian was {{initially}} selected {{to be the}} film's director, but when he continually refused to do a sentimental-type dog story, he was replaced by Leslie H. Martinson. Lillie Hayward and Roberta Hodes wrote the screenplay for the film, adapting several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> stories from the novel to create a single narrative, and adding in an all-purpose villain. The film was released on June 6, 1962. The studio {{hoped it would be}} successful enough to be followed by a second film and a television series. Though praised by fans and modern reviewers, contemporary critiques felt Terhune's work did not translate well to film and it was considered a low budget, B-movie. It was released to home video in 1995.|$|E
