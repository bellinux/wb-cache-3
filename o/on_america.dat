5|$|In June 1910 Pound {{returned}} to the United States for eight months; his arrival coincided {{with the publication of}} his first book of literary criticism, The Spirit of Romance, based on his lecture notes at the polytechnic. His essays <b>on</b> <b>America</b> were written during this period, compiled as Patria Mia and not published until 1950. He loved New York but felt the city was threatened by commercialism and vulgarity, and he no longer felt at home there. He found the New York Public Library, then being built, especially offensive and, according to Paul L. Montgomery, visited the architects' offices almost every day to shout at them.|$|E
5|$|The Ambassador Book Award (1986-2011) was {{presented}} annually by the English-Speaking Union.

25|$|After declaring {{war on the}} United States {{following}} the attack on Pearl Harbor, Adolf Hitler ordered the remaining German saboteurs to work havoc <b>on</b> <b>America.</b> The responsibility for carrying this out was given to German Intelligence (Abwehr).

The first, commanded by George John Dasch, included Ernst Peter Burger, Heinrich Heinck, and Richard Quirin; the second, under command of Edward Kerling, included Hermann Neubauer, Werner Thiel, and Herbert Haupt.|$|E
25|$|Carnival of Chaos {{would be}} the last album with Pete Lee on guitar, being {{replaced}} by Tim Harriss who had previously been in the band around 1986 and was featured as a guest guitarist <b>on</b> <b>America</b> Must Be Destroyed. For the recording of We Kill Everything between late 1998 and early 1999, Michael Bishop would temporarily rejoin the band as the bassist during the absence of Casey Orr. The record, largely influenced by punk rock, is the band's least favorite album and thus its songs are rarely played live.|$|E

25|$|Today, the Senate sent {{a strong}} {{signal to the}} terrorists that we will {{continue}} using every element of national power to pursue our enemies and to prevent attacks <b>on</b> <b>America.</b> The Military Commissions Act of 2006 will allow the continuation of a CIA program that {{has been one of}} America's most potent tools in fighting the War on Terror. Under this program, suspected terrorists have been detained and questioned about threats against our country. Information we have learned from the program has helped save lives at home and abroad. By authorizing the creation of military commissions, the Act will also allow us to prosecute suspected terrorists for war crimes.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Eric Harris {{created a}} private website <b>on</b> <b>America</b> Online. Harris {{initially}} created {{the site to}} host gaming levels he and his friend, Dylan Klebold, created {{for use in the}} video game Doom, primarily for friends. On this site, Harris began a blog, which included jokes and short journal entries with thoughts on parents, school, and friends. By the end of the year, the site contained instructions on how to cause mischief, as well as instructions on how to make explosives, and blogs in which he described the trouble he and Klebold were causing. Beginning in early 1997, the blog postings began to show the first signs of Harris's ever-growing anger against society.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} decades of the 19th century, Alger's moral tone coarsened with the change in boys' tastes. Sensational thrills were wanted by the public. The Protestant work ethic had {{loosened}} its grip <b>on</b> <b>America,</b> and violence, murder, and other sensational themes entered Alger's works. Public librarians questioned whether his books should {{be made available to}} the young. They were briefly successful, but interest in Alger's novels was renewed in {{the first decades of the}} 20th century, and they sold in the thousands. By the time he died in 1899, Alger had published around a hundred volumes. He is buried in South Natick, Massachusetts. Since 1947, the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans has awarded scholarships and prizes to deserving individuals.|$|E

25|$|The 18th century saw an {{increasing}} emphasis <b>on</b> <b>America</b> itself as fit subject matter for its poets. This trend is {{most evident in}} the works of Philip Freneau (17521832), who is also notable for the unusually sympathetic attitude to Native Americans shown in his writings, sometimes reflective of a skepticism toward Anglo-American culture and civilization. However, as might be expected from what was essentially provincial writing, this late colonial poetry is generally somewhat old-fashioned in form and syntax, deploying the means and methods of Pope and Gray in the era of Blake and Burns. The work of Rebecca Hammond Lard (1772–1855), although quite old, still apply to life in today's world. She writes about nature, not only the nature of environment, but also the nature of humans.|$|E
25|$|The Washington Post reports Russian {{operatives}} used Facebook ads {{to exploit}} divisions over black political activism and Muslims. The Russians {{took advantage of}} Facebook’s ability to simultaneously send contrary messages to different groups of users based on their political and demographic characteristics and also sought to sow discord among religious groups. Other ads highlighted support for Democrat Hillary Clinton among Muslim women. The ads suggest that Russian operatives worked off of evolving lists of racial, religious, political and economic themes. They used these to create pages, write posts and craft ads that would appear in user’s news feeds—with the apparent goal of appealing to one audience and alienating another.

25|$|Since {{retiring}} from the Senate, he {{has emerged as a}} consultant on national security, and continues to speak {{on a wide range of}} issues, including the environment and homeland security. In 2006, Hart accepted an endowed professorship at the University of Colorado at Denver. He has been a visiting lecturer at Oxford University, Yale University, and the University of California. He is Chair of the U.S. State Department's International Security Advisory Council, Chair of the U.S. Defense Department's Threat Advisory Council, and Chair of the American Security Project. He was Vice-Chair of the Advisory Council for the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, Co-Chair of the U.S.-Russia Commission, Chairman of the Council for a Livable World, and President of Global Green, the U.S. affiliate of Mikhail Gorbachev's environmental foundation. Most notably, he was Co-Chair of the U.S. Commission on National Security for the 21st Century, known as the Hart-Rudman Commission, which predicted terrorist attacks <b>on</b> <b>America</b> before 9/11.|$|E
