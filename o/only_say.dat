5|$|A {{soldier on}} {{vacation}} here said he witnessed a terrible atrocity {{in the occupied}} parts of Poland. He watched as naked Jewish {{men and women were}} placed in front of a long deep ditch and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians {{in the back of their}} heads and they fell into the ditch. Then the ditch was filled with dirt even as he could still hear screams coming from people still alive in the ditch. These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns. All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub-humans were of the opinion that the German people should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution. There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, when the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them. But because ninety-nine percent of the German population is guilty, directly or indirectly, for the present situation, we can <b>only</b> <b>say</b> that those who travel together will hang together. , Friedrich Kellner exhibit.

5|$|Mitchell’s father (also named Colin) {{came from}} an Argyllshire fishing family. Mitchell (Snr) worked in a solicitor's office and for the MacBrayne ferry company before serving in the 10th Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in World War I. Mitchell (Snr) {{achieved}} the rank of captain (commissioned ‘in the field’) and was awarded the Military Cross at the Second Battle of Ypres but when the young Colin {{asked him how he}} would <b>only</b> <b>say,</b> 'Oh, shooting rabbits'. He was badly gassed in 1918. After the war, he worked in the City of London and married a Glaswegian woman (née Gilmour) whose father worked as a manager for the LMS Railway company. The couple took up residence in the South London suburb of Purley where they had two children – Colin and Henrietta. The family lived in a modest semi-detached house and Colin would attend services at the local Presbyterian Church wearing a kilt.|$|E

25|$|In the Stern-Gerlach {{experiment}} discussed above, {{the spin}} {{of the atom}} about the vertical axis has two eigenstates: up and down. Before measuring it, we can <b>only</b> <b>say</b> that any individual atom has equal probability of being found to have spin up or spin down. The measurement process causes the wavefunction to collapse {{into one of the}} two states.|$|E
25|$|The {{statement}} “I’m {{a believer}} in social Darwinism,” {{did not come from}} me. In fact, I had to look up the expression to learn what was being referred to. This attack appears to be calling me a Nazi, nothing less. I demand that Mr. Storr refer me to the original sources to which we assume he has referred. Until then, I’ll <b>only</b> <b>say</b> that he has carefully selected phrases and statements out of context, not the sort of referencing that I would have expected from him.|$|E

25|$|Acemoglu and Robinson {{counter that}} their theory distinguishes between {{political}} and economic institutions {{and that it is}} not political institutions that contribute to growth directly but economic institutions shaped by the political institutions. In the case of China, even though the political institutions on a higher level are far from inclusive, the incentive to reform Chinese economy does come from political institutions; in 1978 from Deng Xiaoping's Opening up policy {{at the end of the}} internal political feud during the Cultural Revolution. This exactly fits into the theory that the change in political institutions has shaped economic institutions and thus has influenced economic performance. This economic growth is further expected to shape the political institutions in China in the future. One can <b>only</b> <b>say</b> that China is an outlier to the theory when in the future China becomes as wealthy as U.S. or Germany but still remains an authoritarian regime.|$|E
25|$|On the {{borrowing}} end, after 10–20 years, the S 500 corporations {{become extremely}} accustomed to obtaining funds via these money markets, {{which are very}} stable. Initially, perhaps they only borrowed in these markets for a highly seasonal cash needs, being a net borrower for <b>only</b> <b>say</b> 90 days per year. They would borrow here as they experienced their deepest cash needs over an operating cycle to temporarily finance short-term build ups in inventory and receivables. Or, they moved to this funding market from a former bank revolving line of credit, that was guaranteed {{to be available to}} them as they needed it, but had to be cleaned up to a zero balance for at least 60 days out of the year. In these situations the corporations had sufficient other equity and debt financing for all of their regular capital needs. They were however dependent on these sources to be available to them, as needed, on an immediate daily basis.|$|E

[...] The novel was reportedly [...] "loosely based on [...] service on the USS Virgo".|$|E
500|$|She further said, [...] "I can <b>only</b> <b>say</b> {{that the}} {{children}} {{told us that the}} priests had in one case flogged a child for coming to our school, and had used very strong influence to prevent them from coming, and that I have myself been absolutely insulted in the street by Catholic children... who feel erroneously that they were showing their zeal for their own religion by insulting Protestants." ...|$|E

[...] It is virtually impossible now to discern whether MalcolmX's personal beliefs at the time diverged from the teachings of the Nation of Islam. After he left the Nation in 1964, he compared himself to a ventriloquist's dummy who could <b>only</b> <b>say</b> what Elijah Muhammad told him to say.|$|E

500|$|At first, Singh kept a low profile; in 1911 she was {{reluctant}} to make speeches in public or at Women's Social and Political Union meetings. She refused to chair meetings, telling her WSPU colleagues she was [...] "quite useless {{for that sort of}} thing" [...] and would <b>only</b> <b>say</b> [...] "five words if nobody else would support the forthcoming resolution". However, Singh later chaired and addressed a number of meetings. Hirabai, an Indian student in England, noted in 1911 that she displayed a small yellow-and-green badge with her motto: [...] "Votes for women".|$|E
500|$|This lack {{of convincing}} early {{evidence}} {{is the reason}} many recent historians exclude Arthur from their accounts of sub-Roman Britain. In the view of historian Thomas Charles-Edwards, [...] "at {{this stage of the}} enquiry, one can <b>only</b> <b>say</b> that there may well have been an historical Arthur [...] the historian can as yet say nothing of value about him". These modern admissions of ignorance are a relatively recent trend; earlier generations of historians were less sceptical. The historian John Morris made the putative reign of Arthur the organising principle of his history of sub-Roman Britain and Ireland, The Age of Arthur (1973). Even so, he found little to say about a historical Arthur.|$|E
500|$|The {{dialogue}} {{spoken by}} the giant mutant Stan {{was inspired by}} a mentally handicapped character in the MTV show How's Your News?, which Parker and Stone produced; according to Parker and Stone, the character could <b>only</b> <b>say</b> phrases like [...] "Bubba chop, bubba chewy chomp", and both men took turns voicing mutant Stan to sound the same way. Isaac Hayes, who does the voice of Chef, recorded all his lines via phone from New York; Parker and Stone said they were nervous to ask him to repeat the line, [...] "Now I know how all those white women felt", but he had no problem repeating it. The genetic mutations Dr. Mephesto creates, including the animals with multiple asses and the goldfish with bunny ears, were inspired by things Parker drew during high school.|$|E

500|$|Tracy's health {{declined}} {{significantly in}} the 1960s, and Hepburn took a five-year break in her career to care for him. She moved into Tracy's house for this period, and was {{with him when he}} died on June 10, 1967. Out of consideration for Tracy's family, she did not attend his funeral. It was only after Louise Tracy's death, in 1983, that Hepburn began to speak publicly about her feelings for her frequent co-star. In response to the question of why she stayed with Tracy for so long, despite the nature of their relationship, she said, [...] "I honestly don't know. I can <b>only</b> <b>say</b> that I could never have left him." [...] She claimed to not know how he felt about her and that they [...] "just passed twenty-seven years [...] together in what was to me absolute bliss." ...|$|E
500|$|Verity {{is often}} cited {{as one of the}} {{greatest}} slow left-arm spinners to play the game. Robertson-Glasgow wrote: [...] "We can <b>only</b> <b>say</b> that, in his own short time, he was the best of his kind." [...] The writer considered Verity may not quite have achieved the heights of some other great bowlers of his type, but [...] "as a workman-artist, he will take some beating." [...] Douglas Jardine rated him higher than any previous Yorkshire spinners, and Les Ames considered him the best left-arm spinner he had played against. Bradman wrote: [...] "Undoubtedly he w{{as one of the greatest}} slow left-handed spinners of all time. His record testifies to that. No Australian left-hander of that type was Verity's equal and of the Englishmen I saw... there is no doubt that Hedley was as good or better than the others." ...|$|E
500|$|After Wilde {{left the}} court, {{a warrant for}} his arrest was applied for on charges of sodomy and gross indecency. Robbie Ross found Wilde at the Cadogan Hotel, Knightsbridge, with Reginald Turner; both men advised Wilde to go at once to Dover {{and try to get}} a boat to France; his mother advised him to stay and fight. Wilde, lapsing into inaction, could <b>only</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "The train has gone. It's too late." [...] Wilde was arrested for [...] "gross indecency" [...] under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, a term meaning {{homosexual}} acts not amounting to buggery (an offence under a separate statute). At Wilde's instruction, Ross and Wilde's butler forced their way into the bedroom and library of 16 Tite Street, packing some personal effects, manuscripts, and letters. Wilde was then imprisoned on remand at Holloway where he received daily visits from Douglas.|$|E
