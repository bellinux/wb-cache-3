5|$|The {{nuclear fission}} {{properties}} of berkelium {{are different from}} those of the neighboring actinides curium and californium, and they suggest berkelium to perform poorly as a fuel in a nuclear reactor. Specifically, berkelium-249 has a moderately large neutron capture cross section of 710 barns for thermal neutrons, 1200 barns resonance integral, but very low fission cross section for thermal neutrons. In a thermal reactor, much <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> therefore be converted to berkelium-250 which quickly decays to californium-250. In principle, berkelium-249 can sustain a nuclear chain reaction in a fast breeder reactor. Its critical mass is relatively high at 192kg; it can be reduced with a water or steel reflector but would still exceed the world production of this isotope.|$|E
5|$|Iodine oxides are {{the most}} stable of all the halogen oxides, because of the strong I–O bonds {{resulting}} from the large electronegativity difference between iodine and oxygen, {{and they have been}} known for the longest time. The stable, white, hygroscopic iodine pentoxide (I2O5) has been known since its formation in 1813 by Gay-Lussac and Davy. It is most easily made by the dehydration of iodic acid (HIO3), which it is the anhydride <b>of.</b> <b>It</b> <b>will</b> quickly oxidise carbon monoxide completely to carbon dioxide at room temperature, and is thus a useful reagent in determining carbon monoxide concentration. It also oxidises nitrogen oxide, ethylene, and hydrogen sulfide. It reacts with sulfur trioxide and peroxydisulfuryl difluoride (S2O6F2) to form salts of the iodyl cation, +, and is reduced by concentrated sulfuric acids to iodosyl salts involving +. It may be fluorinated by fluorine, bromine trifluoride, sulfur tetrafluoride, or chloryl fluoride, resulting iodine pentafluoride, which also reacts with iodine pentoxide, giving iodine(V) oxyfluoride, IOF3. A few other less stable oxides are known, notably I4O9 and I2O4; their structures have not been determined, but reasonable guesses are IIII(IVO3)3 and +− respectively.|$|E

25|$|A key {{tenet of}} NKS {{is that the}} simpler the system, the more likely a version <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> recur {{in a wide variety}} of more {{complicated}} contexts. Therefore, NKS argues that systematically exploring the space of simple programs will lead to a base of reusable knowledge. However, many scientists believe that of all possible parameters, only some actually occur in the universe. For instance, of all possible permutations of the symbols making up an equation, most will be essentially meaningless. NKS has also been criticized for asserting that the behavior of simple systems is somehow representative of all systems.|$|E

Some <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> evaporate into the air where it will acidify the rain and produce greenhouse gases. It will also seep into the groundwater or run off into nearby bodies of water, thus polluting the drinking water of nearby communities. Poor soil health resulting from overproduction, excessive fertilizer use and inappropriate application of fertilizer causes runoff and leaching. Runoff into forests or marine areas can alter the ecosystem by fertilizing some plan species and poisoning others. The result of toxic runoff from commodity agriculture surrounding the Mississippi River {{can be seen at}} the hypoxic zone where the river meets the Gulf of Mexico. Here, algae grow rampant as a result of nitrogen fertilizer runoff thereby suffocating the animal life. This area has not reduced in size despite previous action plans for reduction made by the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force. This hypoxic zone threatens the $2.8 billion fishing industry that depends on {{the northern part of the}} Gulf, which could affect the economy at large.|$|E

25|$|It is not {{necessary}} for a trademark owner to take enforcement action against all infringement {{if it can be}} shown that the owner perceived the infringement to be minor and inconsequential. This is designed to prevent owners from continually being tied up in litigation for fear of cancellation. An owner can at any time commence action for infringement against a third party as long as it had not previously notified the third party of its discontent following third party use and then failed to take action within a reasonable period of time (called acquiescence). The owner can always reserve the right to take legal action until a court decides that the third party had gained notoriety which the owner 'must' have been aware <b>of.</b> <b>It</b> <b>will</b> be for the third party to prove their use of the mark is substantial as it is the onus of a company using a mark to check they are not infringing previously registered rights. In the US, owing to the overwhelming number of unregistered rights, trademark applicants are advised to perform searches not just of the trademark register but of local business directories and relevant trade press. Specialized search companies perform such tasks prior to application.|$|E

The ablation and vaporization caused by its fall on a decaying trajectory towards the Sun may remove Earth's crust and mantle, then finally destroy it after at most 200 years. Following this event, Earth's sole legacy will be a very slight increase (0.01%) of the solar metallicity.§IIC ...|$|E

After returning to the Black Order, a Level 4 Akuma attacks the HQ, and many people are injured or killed. Lenalee willingly expresses a desire to become an exorcist. Accepting her conviction, the Innocence grants her greater power, becoming a never-before-seen evolved Equipment-type, dubbed a Crystal-type. These new Boots are made up of Lenalee's blood and repair themselves as long as she has blood in her body. When the Dark Boots are in their dormant state, they form two blood-red anklets.
