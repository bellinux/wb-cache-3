40|$|Oceanic high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll environments {{have been}} {{highlighted}} for potential large-scale iron fertilizations to help mitigate global climate change. Controversy surrounds these initiatives, {{both in the}} degree of carbon removal and magnitude of ecosystem impacts. Previous open <b>ocean</b> <b>enrichment</b> experiments have shown that iron additions stimulate growth of the toxigenic diatom genus Pseudonitzschia. Most Pseudonitzschia species in coastal waters produce the neurotoxin domoic acid (DA), with their blooms causing detrimental marine ecosystem impacts, but oceanic Pseudonitzschia species are considered nontoxic. Here we demonstrate that the sparse oceanic Pseudonitzschia community at the high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll Ocean Station PAPA (50 ° N, 145 ° W) produces approximately 200 pg DA L− 1 in response to iron addition, that DA alters phytoplankton community structure to benefit Pseudonitzschia, and that oceanic cell isolates are toxic. Given the negative effects of DA in coastal food webs, these findings raise serious concern over the net benefit and sustainability of large-scale iron fertilizations...|$|E
40|$|Variability in anchovy {{recruitment}} in Biscay is temptatively explained using variables {{from the}} stock and from the environment during the ichtyoplankton phase. Anchovy recruitment depends on many different processes : weight of adults and proportion of multiple spawners (age 2), river discharges, upwelling events at the coast and at the shelf break. Meteorological variables (wind, rain, tempe rature) are forcing effects on the sea {{but they are not}} the effective processes that govern the production in the sea. So they do not relate directly to the survival of larvae and to recruitment. In Biscay, many different physical processes are active and used by anchovy which spawns in different physical systems (river plumes, open <b>ocean</b> <b>enrichment</b> systems). Therefore we use a hydrodynamical physical model to construct environmental variables that relate directly to the physical pro cesses that occur in the sea. Such environmental variables are thought to have a more powerfull explanatory power than general meteorological variables alone. Stock effects are  parametrised by the importance in the population of year class 2 and by individual average weight. Environmental effects are physical indices derived from the physical model: vertical turbulence, stratification,  upwelling, river plumes.   As we have a small amount of years and a lot of variables, a step by step regression analysis (Linear Model) is used to analyse hierarchy in the explanatory power of the factors. Upwelling is the first explanatory variable with a very strong positive effect on recruitment, then cornes breakdown of stratification events with a negative effect. All other variables have a smaller explanatory power on recruitment and the stock effect is found to be not significant. A model with 2 physical variables explains 80 % of the recruitment variability observed in the 1987 - 1996...|$|E
40|$|The Southern Ocean Iron Experiment (SOFeX) was an {{experiment}} {{decades in the}} planning. It's implementation {{was among the most}} complex ship operations that SIO has been involved in. The SOFeX field expedition was successful in creating and tracking two experimentally enriched areas of the Southern Ocean, one characterized by low silicic acid, one characterized by high silicic acid. Both experimental sites were replete with abundant nitrate. About 100 scientists were involved overall. The major findings of this study were significant in several ways: (1) The productivity of the southern ocean is limited by iron availability. (2) Carbon uptake and flux is therefore controlled by iron availability (3) In spite of low silicic acid, iron promotes non-silicious phytoplankton growth and the uptake of carbon dioxide. (4) The transport of fixed carbon from the surface layers proceeds with a C:N ratio that would indicate differential remineralization of nitrogen at shallow depths. (5) These finding have major implications for modeling of carbon export based on nitrate utilization. (6) The general results of the experiment indicate that, beyond other southern <b>ocean</b> <b>enrichment</b> experiments, iron inputs have a much wider impact of productivity and carbon cycling than previously demonstrated.

40|$|Ocean {{acidification}} {{is driven}} by increasing atmospheric CO and represents a key threat to the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and other coral reefs globally. Previous investigations have depended on studies in aquaria that are compromised by reduced ecological complexity and buffering capacity, and problems associated with containment. These aquaria studies also include artifacts such as artificial flow, light, temperature, and water quality conditions. In order to avoid these issues a new technology was needed for in situ science. This need was the driver behind development of the Free <b>Ocean</b> Carbon <b>Enrichment</b> (FOCE) approach. FOCE is similar in approach to the Free Air Carbon Enrichment (FACE) experiments pursued on land for almost two decades. FOCE as a systems concept was developed at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) to perform controlled in situ studies {{on the effects of}} increased carbon dioxide on ocean environments. FOCE systems inject carbon dioxide enriched water into the desired control volume to lower the environmental pH to a specified value. The challenge of maintaining reef conditions while manipulating the carbonate chemistry further advanced the FOCE concept. A shallow water reef version of FOCE was needed to perform this research at the University of Queensland. Working with MBARI the University of Queensland developed the Coral Proto - Free <b>Ocean</b> Carbon Dioxide <b>Enrichment</b> (CP - FOCE) system. Although the CP-FOCE does not differ conceptually from the original FOCE it is different in a couple of respects. First, it requires that a region of the coral flat be semi-enclosed in the chamber section of CP-FOCE. This allows the required amount of CO to be optimised. Second, by closing the enclosure off fully for a short time, the oxygen levels and carbonate chemistry can be accurately measured to determine net production/respiration as well as the calcification/dissolution rates of the organisms living within the chamber. In this paper we present the engineering details of the CP-FOCE system design. This paper details the unique engineering design and challenges of the CP-FOCE system The paper briefly outlines the chemical and biological requirements that provided the technical specifications for CP-FOCE to successfully study the impacts of the changing water chemistry on the physiology of calcareous reef organisms including corals and calcareous algae. We have also a brief outline of the methods used to perform measurements of calcification and dissolution rates. Additionally, we include discussion on production and respiration rates in CP-FOCE systems when maintained at ambient and two different increased pCO scenarios.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that an increase in iron supply causes an increase in total oceanic primary production in many regions, but the physiological mechanism driving the observed increases has not been clearly identified. The Southern <b>Ocean</b> iron <b>enrichment</b> experiment, an iron fertilization experiment in the waters closest to Antarctica, resulted in a 9 -fold increase in chlorophyll (Chl) concentration and a 5 -fold increase in integrated primary production. Upon iron addition, the maximum quantum yield of photosynthesis (φm) rapidly doubled, from 0. 011 to 0. 025 mol C·mol quanta− 1. Paradoxically, this increase in light-limited productivity was not accompanied by {{a significant increase in}} light-saturated productivity (Pmaxb). Pmaxb, maximum Chl normalized productivity, was 1. 34 mg C·mg Chl− 1 ·h− 1 outside and 1. 49 mg C·mg Chl− 1 ·h− 1 inside the iron-enriched patch. The importance of φm as compared with Pmaxb in controlling the biological response to iron addition has vast implications for understanding the ecological response to iron. We show that an iron-driven increase in φm is the proximate physiological mechanism affected by iron addition and can account for most of the increases in primary production. The relative importance of φm over Pmaxb in this iron-fertilized bloom highlights the limitations of often-used primary productivity algorithms that are driven by estimates of Pmaxb but largely ignore variability in φm and light-limited productivity. To use primary productivity models that include variability in iron supply in prediction or forecasting, the variability of light-limited productivity must be resolved...|$|R

The FOCE experiment was designed to simulate the effects of CO 2 -driven acidification predicted to occur {{by the end of}} this century (scenario RCP 4. 5) while simultaneously maintaining the exposure of corals to natural variations in their environment under in situ conditions. Analyses of skeletal growth (measured from extension rates and skeletal density) showed no systematic differences between low-pH FOCE treatments (Delta pH = similar to- 0. 05 to - 0. 25 units below ambient) and present day controls (Delta pH = 0) for calcification rates or the pH of the calcifying fluid (pH(cf)); the latter was derived from boron isotopic compositions (delta B- 11) of the coral skeleton. Furthermore, individual nubbins exhibited near constant delta B- 11 compositions along their primary apical growth axes (+/- 0. 02 pH(cf) units) regardless of the season or treatment. Thus, under the highly dynamic conditions of the Heron Island reef flat, P. cylindrica up-regulated the pH of its calcifying fluid (pH(cf) similar to 8. 4 - 8. 6), with each nubbin having near-constant pHcf values independent of the large natural seasonal fluctuations of the reef flat waters (pH similar to 7. 7 to similar to 8. 3) or the superimposed FOCE treatments. This newly discovered phenomenon of pH homeostasis during calcification indicates that coral living in highly dynamic environments exert strong physiological controls on the carbonate chemistry of their calcifying fluid, implying a high degree of resilience to ocean acidification within the investigated ranges...|$|R

The present article reports the results of a field study into the effects of Fe limitation on the Cd : P composition of natural assemblages of marine phytoplankton in the Antarctic Zone of the Pacific sector of the Southern <b>Ocean.</b> Iron <b>enrichment</b> to shipboard incubation bottles led to increases in community growth rate and final biomass. After 10. 7 d of incubation, the climax community was dominated by large diatoms of the genus Fragillariopsis, Pseudonitzschia, and Nitzschia. Direct measurements of phytoplankton metal : P ratios from controlled shipboard experiments indicate that Cd : P, Co: P, and Zn : P ratios decreased from control values with increasing initial dissolved Fe concentrations in the incubation bottles, by factors of ~ 2 – 10 at highest Fe additions. We suggest that the effect of Fe limitation on resident diatoms is to decrease growth rate, leading to elevated cellular Cd content. The dissolved Cd : P ratio in iron-limited surface waters of the Southern Ocean may, therefore, respond to the supply of Fe to the resident phytoplankton community, which has implications for the developing paleonutrient proxy. We suggest that the biological uptake of Cd and P is independent of the dissolved Cd: PO 4 ratio. As a consequence, the results argue against the use of empirical Rayleigh fractionation models or models with fixed phytoplankton uptake ratios to account for regional variability in surface water dissolved Cd : PO 4...|$|R

However, empirical documentation of microbial activity from subsurface basalts is still lacking, particularly in the cool (< 25 °C) regions of the crust, where are assumed to harbor active iron-oxidizing microbial communities. To test this hypothesis, we report the enrichment and isolation of crust-associated microorganisms from North Pond, a site of relatively young and cold basaltic basement on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge that was sampled during Expedition 336 of the Integrated <b>Ocean</b> Drilling Program. <b>Enrichment</b> experiments with different carbon (bicarbonate, acetate, methane) and nitrogen (nitrate and ammonium) sources revealed significant cell growth (one magnitude higher cell abundance), higher intracellular DNA content, and increased Fe 3 +/ΣFe ratios only when nitrogen substrates were added. Furthermore, a Marinobacter strain with neutrophilic iron-oxidizing capabilities was isolated from the basalt. This work reveals that basalt-associated microorganisms at North Pond had the potential for activity and that microbial growth could be stimulated by in vitro nitrogen addition.

After the conclusion of dpFOCE, MBARI developed an open source shallow water FOCE (swFOCE) platform located at around 250 meter of water to facilitate worldwide shallow water experiments on FOCE [1][2]. A shallow water platform can be more ubiquitous than a deep-water platform as shallow water instruments are less expensive (as it {{does not have to be}} designed to withstand the pressure at deep ocean depths) and more easily deployed (they can be deployed right along the coast). The swFOCE experiment is an open source platform, and MBARI has made the plans available online to anyone interested in studying shallow water carbon enrichment. There is a gateway node what is connected to four sensor nodes within the swFOCE. In order to test the sensor node individually, an idea of designing an Oceanographic Instrument Simulator is purposed. The Oceanographic instrument simulator (OIS), described in this paper provides the means for MBARI engineers to test the swFOCE platform without attaching the numerous and expensive oceanographic instruments. The Oceanographic Instrument Simulator simulates the various scientific instruments that could be deployed in an actual experiment. The Oceanographic Instrument Simulator (OIS) system includes the designed circuit board, Arduino Due and an SD Card shield. The designed circuit board will be connected to a computer through a USB cable, and be connected to MBARI’s swFOCE sensor node through a serial connection. When a query is given from the sensor node, the Arduino Due will parse the data given from the sensor node, search through the pre-installed data in the SD card and return the appropriate data back to the sensor node.

A Free <b>Ocean</b> Carbon Dioxide <b>Enrichment</b> system was used to lower pH by a ~ 0. 3 unit offset within a partially enclosed portion (1. 7 m 3) of a Posidonia oceanica meadow (11 m depth) between June 21 and November 3, 2014. Leaf epiphytic community composition (% cover) and bulk epiphytic mineralogy were compared every 4 weeks within three treatments, located in the same meadow: a pH-manipulated (experimental enclosure) and a control enclosure, {{as well as a}} nearby ambient area. Percent coverage of invertebrate calcifiers and crustose coralline algae (CCA) {{did not appear to be}} affected by the lowered pH. Furthermore, fleshy algae did not proliferate at lowered pH. Only Foraminifera, which covered less than 3 % of leaf surfaces, declined in manner consistent with ocean acidification predictions. Bulk epiphytic magnesium carbonate composition was similar between treatments and percentage of magnesium appeared to increase from summer to autumn. CCA did not exhibit any visible skeleton dissolution or mineral alteration at lowered pH and carbonate saturation state. Negative impacts from ocean acidification on P. oceanica epiphytic communities were smaller than expected. Epiphytic calcifiers were possibly protected from the pH treatment due to host plant photosynthesis inside the enclosure where water flow is slowed. The more positive outcome than expected suggests that calcareous members of epiphytic communities may find refuge in some conditions and be resilient to environmentally relevant changes in carbonate chemistry...|$|R

40|$|A deep {{chlorophyll}} {{a maximum}} (DCM) at depths between 60 and 90 m in waters {{south of the}} Antarctic Polar Front (APF) occurs only in pelagic waters where the chlorophyll a concentrations in the upper mixed layer (UML) are very low (generally < 0. 2 mg m–³). Dissolved Fe concentrations in these waters with DCMs are also very low (generally < 0. 2 nM) and are probably a limiting factor for phytoplankton growth and biomass. DCMs occur in the upper portion of the temperature minimum layer (TML), which is the winter residue of the Antarctic Surface Water (AASW). The higher phytoplankton biomass at these depths is thought to result from higher Fe concentrations in the winter remnant of the AASW as compared to that found in the overlying UML. A survey of the literature indicates that DCMs are located predominately over the deep <b>ocean</b> basins where <b>enrichment</b> of surface waters with Fe from either coastal sediments or from upwelling processes would be minimal. DCMs are not found in coastal waters or in pelagic regions where complex bottom topography causes upwelling of deep water with sufficiently high Fe concentrations to enhance surface chlorophyll a concentrations. Such enrichment of surface waters overlying or downstream of topographical seamounts or ridges that rise to within a few thousand meters of the surface usually results in elevated phytoplankton biomass in the UML and no DCM due to decreased solar irradiance in the TML. The effect of such enrichment of Fe in surface pelagic waters that results from upwelling processes is most pronounced in the Scotia Sea, in the Polar Frontal region downstream of South Georgia, over the Southwest Indian Ridge, over the Kerguelen Plateau, and over the Pacific Antarctic and Southeast Indian Ridges...|$|R

To test for ocean acidification effects on seagrass meadows under controlled CO 2 /pH conditions, we used a Free <b>Ocean</b> Carbon Dioxide <b>Enrichment</b> (FOCE) system which allows for the manipulation of pH as continuous offset from ambient. It was deployed in a Posidonia oceanica meadow at 11  m depth in the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea. It consisted of two benthic enclosures, an experimental {{and a control unit}} both 1. 7  m 3, and an additional reference plot in the ambient environment (2  m 2) to account for structural artifacts. The meadow was monitored from April to November 2014. The pH of the experimental enclosure was lowered by 0. 26 pH units for {{the second half of the}} 8 -month study. The greatest magnitude of change in P. oceanica leaf biometrics, photosynthesis, and leaf growth accompanied seasonal changes recorded in the environment and values were similar between the two enclosures. Leaf thickness may change in response to lower pH but this requires further testing. Results are congruent with other short-term and natural studies that have investigated the response of P. oceanica over a wide range of pH. They suggest any benefit from ocean acidification, over the next century (at a pH of [*]∼  7. 7 on the total scale), on Posidonia physiology and growth may be minimal and difficult to detect without increased replication or longer experimental duration. The limited stimulation, which did not surpass any enclosure or seasonal effect, casts doubts on speculations that elevated CO 2 would confer resistance to thermal stress and increase the buffering capacity of meadows...|$|R

Epibiont colonization and early post settlement stages were assessed within the FOCE setup, {{as part of the}} larger community-level study, to better understand the outcome for a multispecies assemblage and the ecological processes that result in reported community shifts under altered carbonate chemistry. Two types of artificial collectors (tiles and scourers) were placed within three treatments: a pH-manipulated enclosure, an un-manipulated control enclosure, and an open plot in the ambient meadow. Tiles and scourers were collected after one to four months. Additionally, to see whether the outcome differed for communities in a later successional stage, previously settled scourer-collectors were also placed in the same three treatments. Enclosures acted to reduce settlement and migrant colonization. Scourers deployed for one to four months within the open-plot contained a community assemblage that could be distinguished from the assemblages within the enclosures. However, a comparison of enclosure assemblages on tiles showed evidence of a pH effect. There was lowered coverage of crustose coralline algae and fewer calcareous tube-forming polychaetes (Spirorbis sp. and Spirobranchus sp.) on tiles placed in the pH-manipulated enclosure compared to the un-manipulated enclosure. For assemblages in scourer collectors, shared and common taxa, in all treatments, were invertebrate polychaetes Psamathe fusca, Sphaerosyllis sp., Chrysopetalum sp., arthropods Harpacticoida, and Amphipoda, and the juvenile bivalve Lyonsia sp. Similar organism composition and abundance, as well as taxonomic richness and evenness, were found in scourers from both enclosures. Pre-settled scourers contained greater numbers of individuals and more calcified members, but the assemblage, as well as the growth rate of a juvenile bivalve Lyonsia sp., appeared unaffected by a two-month exposure to lowered pH and calcium carbonate saturation state. Results from this case study support the hypothesis that early stages of specific calcifiers (crustose coralline algae and calcareous tube-forming polychaetes) are sensitive to near future ocean acidification conditions yet suggest that negative effects on sessile micro-invertebrate assemblages will be minimal...|$|R

We use naturally occurring radioisotopes of radium to constrain rates of chemical fluxes into Ryder Bay (a small coastal embayment in northern Marguerite Bay), and hence to evaluate possible sources of sediment-derived micronutrients and estimate sediment-ocean mixing rates. We present the first coupled, short-lived radium isotope (Ra- 223 and Ra- 224) measurements from Antarctic waters, both present at very low activities (mean 0. 155 and 3. 21 dpm m(- 3), respectively), indicating much lower radium inputs than in other coastal environments. Longer-lived Ra- 228 activity was also lower than existing nearshore values, but higher than open ocean waters, indicating some degree of coastal radium input on timescales exceeding the week-to-month range reflected by Ra- 223 and Ra- 224. Using a simple diffusion model along a shore to mid-bay transect, effective horizontal eddy diffusivity estimates ranged from 0. 22 - 0. 83 m(2) s(- 1) from Ra- 223 and Ra- 224, respectively, much lower than already-low mixing estimates for the Southern <b>Ocean.</b> Significant radium <b>enrichment</b> and much faster mixing (18 m(2) s(- 1)) was found near a marine-terminating glacier and consequently any sediment-derived micronutrient inputs in this location are more probably dominated by glacial processes than groundwater, land runoff, or marine sediment sources...|$|R
