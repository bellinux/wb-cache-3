It was wider and usable by vehicles up to [...] During construction, transport minister Ernest Marples clarified that unlike the Dartford Tunnel, also then under construction, tolls would not be imposed as the tunnel was already an established route. At the time of opening, the strip lighting in the tunnel was commended as [...] "a big improvement" [...] on the standard provided in the original tunnel. In contrast with the Victorian northbound tunnel, the eastern tunnel had no sharp bends, and emergency telephones were provided. Its distinctive ventilation towers were designed in 1964 by GLC architect Terry Farrell. Immediately after opening, the old tunnel was closed for refurbishment. It re-opened on 4 April 1969 with a new electronic system to detect <b>overheight</b> vehicles.|$|E

5000|$|Queen of Alberni was {{different}} from the others, as she only had one car deck designed to carry <b>overheight</b> vehicles. Her lack of an upper car deck put its capacity at 145 <b>overheight</b> vehicles. The ferry's high truck capacity made her a natural for the service's Tsawwassen-Duke Point route (established in 1990 as the Mid-Island Express, running between Tsawwassen and Departure Bay; and later between Tsawwassen and Duke Point), which is intended for a high volume of <b>overheight</b> vehicles. This route is also served by , a [...] In 1984, the ship was stretched and lifted, gaining an upper car deck for non-overheight vehicles, leading to a new vehicle capacity of 292.

50|$|The bus {{would have}} alarms to warn cars {{traveling}} {{too close to}} it, and signals to warn other vehicles when it is about to turn. It would have inflatable evacuation slides {{similar to those of}} an aircraft. Optional features could include sensors to keep it from colliding with a person or object (such as an <b>overheight</b> vehicle in front), warning lights and safety curtains at the rear to keep drivers of <b>overheight</b> vehicles from going underneath, repeater traffic signals underneath to relay the indications of traffic signals up ahead, and animated light displays to simulate stationary objects to prevent disorientation of drivers underneath.|$|E

50|$|All bores are {{equipped}} with an automated height control at each entrance. As soon as a vehicle with a height of more than 4 meters enters the tunnel, the system will stop all traffic in that lane and direction of traffic.

50|$|The Tenaka is {{a single}} ended ferry that carries 30 cars and 150 passengers. Two Caterpillar engines provide 1700 {{horsepower}} and give the Tenaka a speed of 12 knots. There are two passenger deck levels on the ferry. There are two lounges on the lower passenger level that are {{on each side of}} the <b>overheight</b> car lane. Another passenger lounge directly above extends across the width of the ferry. The Tenaka has a vending machine and washrooms, but no other passenger amenities. It has two outside decks astern of each passenger cabin.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bridge was}} built in 1878 by E.H. Stone. It is similar in {{construction}} to five other area bridges, whose shared characteristics include extended eaves, half-wall siding, and portals with diagonal corners. In 1973, the bridge was crossed by an <b>overheight</b> truck, doing substantial damage to its south portal. [...] The bridge has since then undergone restoration. At {{the time of its}} listing on the National Register, Vermont 122 was routed down Center Street, making the bridge the only 19th-century bridge carrying a state numbered highway in the state.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{at the request}} of the Metropolitan District Commission (now the DCR) in an attempt to reduce the {{incidence}} of <b>overheight</b> vehicles finding their way onto Storrow Drive [...] US 1 was moved onto I-93 south of and through Boston, leaving the old route - VFW Parkway, Jamaicaway, Riverway, and Storrow Drive through Dedham, Brookline, West Roxbury and several other Boston neighborhoods - without a number. There are still some street signs incorrectly indicating the former alignment as US 1, and many local residents still refer to parts of VFW Parkway and Jamaicaway as [...] "Route 1", as if it still runs along its old trajectory.|$|E
50|$|The {{vertical}} clearance for vehicles {{is limited by}} the portals and sideways sway structs. These are relatively low in older bridges. In Washington State bridges, the sway struts are often curved downwards at the outer ends, with less clearance above the outer lanes and outer shoulders. Tall loads then need to use the inner lanes for maximal clearance. These bridges are vulnerable to impacts by <b>overheight</b> vehicles, and such impacts were common. There was a known strike on this bridge that occurred on October 22, 2012, and investigators found evidence of several other impacts in years past. Bridge inspection reports dating back to 1979 frequently note damage caused by over-height vehicles, and an inspection report from late 2012 noted a three-inch gash in the steel.|$|E
50|$|For 37 miles {{between the}} eastern end of its {{concurrency}} with I-79 in Washington and the western end of its concurrency with the Pennsylvania Turnpike in New Stanton, I-70 has several dated design features. The median narrows to the point that there are no shoulders between the median barrier and the passing lanes on both sides. On- and off-ramps at many of the interchanges are substandard in both length and geometry, which requires vehicles to decelerate in the travel lanes before entering the off-ramps, and also necessitates the use of stop signs on the on-ramps instead of yield signs. Several overpasses do not meet minimum clearance requirements, which has resulted in damage to, and from, <b>overheight</b> trucks. Total reconstruction efforts are ongoing that will upgrade most of this segment of I-70 and its interchanges to modern Interstate standards, and various projects are scheduled through the early 2020s.|$|E
50|$|The 11 foot 8 Bridge, {{also known}} as the Norfolk Southern-Gregson Street Overpass, located in Durham, North Carolina, United States, is a {{railroad}} bridge that has attracted media attention, including front-page coverage in The Wall Street Journal, because of the frequency of collisions due to the bridge's unusually low clearance. <b>Overheight</b> vehicles such as trucks and RVs frequently collide with the abnormally low overpass, resulting in damage ranging from RV roof air conditioners being scraped off, to entire truck roofs themselves being peeled off. The media has focused on video clips of the crashes, which are posted on the Internet for public viewing. This railroad overpass along South Gregson Street in Durham, North Carolina, provides only 11 ft of vertical clearance. The -year-old bridge cannot be raised, because nearby railroad crossings would also have to be raised. The street cannot be lowered, because a major sewer line runs only 4 ft under Gregson Street.|$|E
5000|$|MV Queen of Cowichan is a BC Ferries vessel, {{built in}} Victoria, British Columbia in 1976. It joined {{the other two}} C-class ferries built that year, [...] and , and was {{followed}} by [...] and [...] The ship, like all C-class ferries, is double-ended. This means the ship never has to turn around in port during regular service. The ships two MaK 12M551AK engines turn out [...] which gives it a service speed of 22 kn. Like all the C-class ferries it is 139.28 m long. Almost identical to Queen of Coquitlam, the vessel has a car capacity of 392 and a passenger capacity for 1,466 people. The ship has two car decks. A lower car deck capable of carrying trucks and buses carries the <b>overheight</b> vehicles while the upper car deck can carry {{the majority of the}} cars on board. She is named for the regional district of Cowichan Valley Regional District.|$|E
50|$|The current {{westbound}} tunnel from Norfolk to Hampton is {{the original}} tunnel constructed in 1957 and has a lower clearance than the newer eastbound tube built in the 1970s—13 ft as opposed to 14 ft. Because of this, special over-height detectors have been installed near the Willoughby Spit end of the bridge. If a truck makes it beyond this inspection point and trips the over height sensor, the truck will be alerted and flagged to stop prior to {{the entrance to the}} tunnel, where with a fine of up to $2,500 if the over height occurs during rush hour. This is because any vehicle turnaround at the tunnel requires a full-stoppage of traffic in both directions in order to redirect the affected vehicle {{from one side of the}} bridge to the other. VDOT currently has identified new systems to improve the <b>overheight</b> detection system, by detecting vehicles well in advance of the tunnel to cut down on the over heights approaching the tunnel, This project is estimated to cost the state $900,000.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are some}} distinctions between vessels, most {{obviously}} the different profile of Powell River Queen- {{instead of having}} two passenger lounges on Deck Three and a centre lane for taller traffic like her sisters, Powell River Queen has all that space for <b>overheight</b> vehicles, resulting in the different look. Mayne Queen {{is the only one}} to have ever had side loading capabilities, for use at a pier as opposed to strictly BC Ferries terminals. These were fitted at the time of manufacture, and remained until a $9 million overhaul of the entire class in 1979 when along with being stretched and re-engined, she had her side ramp capability removed. [...] It is still possible to see the depression {{in the side of the}} deck where the ramp once was, just behind the painted propeller warning on opposing corners of the vessel. Bowen Queen, only used now as a relief vessel along a number of routes when required, still has a staffed snack bar, whereas Mayne Queen has had hers removed, in favour of vending machines.|$|E
50|$|Longitudinal {{analysis}} can explore associations {{in a way}} that cross-sectional studies cannot. EarlyBird established early on that insulin resistance is no longer associated with birth weight (a surrogate for gestational nutrition) - rather, the driver in contemporary children is weight gained during the early years. It showed how the large majority of excess weight gained by a child before puberty was gained before 5y. Obesity is not the result of inactivity in children, but the cause, and physical activity imposed at one time of day is compensated for - with remarkable precision - at another, supporting the concept of the ‘activitystat’, and questioning the value of imposing physical activity as a means of weight reduction in childhood. It went on to establish that today’s obese girls are largely the daughters of obese mothers (not fathers), and obese boys the sons of obese fathers (not mothers). The offspring of normal weight parents are no heavier than they were a generation ago. Children who have the privilege of sports clubs record no more activity than those who do not and, worryingly, parents are unaware of their children's overweight. Height, like weight, is dependent on nutrition and, while the focus has been on overweight, there is evidence that many of today’s children are <b>overheight,</b> with independent metabolic consequences. Finally, EarlyBird offers unique evidence that the stress of insulin resistance among overweight children erodes their insulin production to the point where over 20% of the cohort showed evidence of pre-diabetes by the age of 16 years (in preparation). This is the most worrying spectre of all to have emerged from the EarlyBird study, because pre-diabetes frequently spells diabetes within a few years.|$|E
50|$|SR 424 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with US 24 {{inside the city}} limits of Defiance, though 3 mi west {{of the center of}} the city. At this point, the route was also called Baltimore Street. At the intersection with Deatrick Street, the name of the street that carried SR 424 changed to Holgate Avenue; <b>overheight</b> truck routes for SR 66 and SR 111 were designated along this section of SR 424 as well. Continuing northeast, the route made a sharp curve to the southeast and changed its name to West Third Avenue. Shortly after passing under an Indiana Northeastern Railroad bridge, the route came to a signalized intersection with South Clinton Avenue which also carries SR 111 in downtown Defiance. SR 424 turned left onto South Clinton Avenue with the last block of SR 111 before coming to the intersection with State Routes 15, 18, and 66. SR 111 ends while SR 424 continued with the three state routes north on Clinton Avenue and over the Maumee River on a bridge. Immediately after the bridge, SR 424 turned right onto River Drive while the three other routes continue on Clinton Avenue. From this point to the eastern terminus, SR 424 closely followed the northern bank of the Maumee River. In the eastern neighborhoods of Defiance, SR 424 passed under the bridge that carries SR 281 over the river; a short connector road provided access to SR 281. In Richland Township, SR 424 passed the entrances to the Independence Dam State Park. Just after the park, the route curved to the northeast and crossed into Henry County.|$|E
5000|$|Pilot/Escort {{vehicles}} are Public Safety Vehicles, {{they are also}} considered a warning device to forewarn the public of a potential danger. Usually equipped with a C.B. Radio, or other Two way Radios {{to communicate with each}} other. On a two lane road, a load with one escort takes position in front of the load being escorted, on a four or more lane road the escort then transitions behind the truck being escorted. Depending {{on the size of the}} load, the load may require more escorts, usually one in the front and one in the rear. For overwidth or <b>overheight</b> trucks one escort vehicle will drive 2500' to 1 miles ahead of the truck to ensure the road ahead can accommodate the truck's oversize dimensions. This lead vehicle is usually equipped with a long pole (High-Pole) that extends upward from the front bumper; its length is adjusted six to eight inches above the height of the truck's load or the tallest part of the load within a convoy. If the pole strikes any overhanging objects such as bridges, overhead signs, or power lines, the truck or convoy can be alerted and stopped or diverted long before an accident occurs. In Australia all oversize equipment is imported in pieces on cargo ships; the components are then loaded onto trucks that are powerful enough to haul the extremely heavy machinery. In New South Wales, oversize trucks are only allowed to operate between 11 pm and 5 am. If the truck is still in transit by 5 am, it must by law pull over to a safe area and wait until 11 pm to continue its journey. Along the predetermined route (Already safe-proof from narrow roads and low objects through many years of transportation of heavy oversize machines) the front escort must have amber safety lights that can be seen from 360° and from at least 500 feet. A sign displaying [...] "Oversize Load" [...] must be on the front and the rear of the escort vehicle, or one sign that displays [...] "Oversize Load" [...] on both sides may be mounted on top of the vehicle, the sign must be at least 5 feet wide and 12 inches high, with eight inch letters with a 2-inch brush stroke. The front escort is to ensure that oncoming {{vehicles are}} warned of the oversized load approaching. Because it is illegal for the Front Pilot/Escort to cross the line into the oncoming lane, it can be difficult to get the traffic to stop for something such as a narrow bridge, so the front escort usually goes far enough in advance to warn the truck driver via C.B. Radio about the oncoming traffic so the driver can stop before the bridge until the front driver relays back to the driver that it is safe to cross with out the fear of oncoming Traffic. The Rear Pilot/Escort may perform duties such as staying in one or more lanes other than the lanes that the truck and load are occupying to block traffic off while the truck and trailer make their turn. The rear Escort may also make sudden lane changes, this is usually because the truck needs to change lanes because of a lane ending or obstruction in the road ahead, or one or more vehicles parked on the shoulder of the road, such as police or towtruck. If the escort moves over, it is a safe bet that you should as well. (Some Escort Companies have special authority for Traffic Control thru State approval) [...] "May or may not have flashing strobe lights other than Amber or White" [...] (Green and or Red) depends on job duties.|$|E
40|$|<b>Overheight</b> vehicle impacts with bridges are {{surprisingly}} common. The damage from collisions {{can range from}} minor to severe, {{and there is also}} evidence that some bridges are impacted multiple times, leading to the potential for cumulative damage effects. Thus there is a clear need to attempt to prevent <b>overheight</b> vehicle collisions with bridges. This Synthesis Study provides a review of solutions that exist to detect and forewarn <b>overheight</b> vehicles and thereby prevent a collision, and specifically examines the breadth of available <b>overheight</b> vehicle detection technologies, the commercial availability of such equipment, and the experience of relevant DOTs with installed and functioning systems. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} most states have updated their infrastructure to account for <b>overheight</b> vehicles and permanently avoid collisions. The few states that still actively employ <b>overheight</b> vehicle detection and warning systems (OVD 2 ̆ 6 W) tend to use optoelectronic single- or dual-eye infrared detection systems and report that the devices have decreased the amount of damage occurring to their structures. The initial equipment and installation costs of these systems range from a few thousand to twenty-five thousand dollars based on DOT interviews, and on-going maintenance appears minimal. Overall, considering that the only other completely effective option to avoid <b>overheight</b> vehicle incidents is to raise the height of affected structures, or lower the roadway surface, an (optoelectronic) OVD 2 ̆ 6 W system is a relatively inexpensive and effective method for decreasing <b>overheight</b> vehicle accidents. With this in mind, this study provides a guide to the site characteristics that influence both sensor selection and overall OVD 2 ̆ 6 W system design. A simple Equipment Selection Tool is presented to guide system choice, and is demonstrated through a case example centered on the I- 65 – I- 70 merger location in Indianapolis, IN...|$|E
40|$|Tidal watertable {{fluctuations}} in a coastal aquifer {{are driven by}} tides on a moving boundary that varies with the beach slope. Based on a linearised one-dimensional Boussinesq model, tidal signals in the aquifer are analysed, focusing on the watertable <b>overheight</b> induced by the moving-boundary condition. The watertable <b>overheight</b> is an important parameter related to the estimation of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). This note presents a new analytical approach to solving the Boussinesq equation with the Fourier-series expansion. Moreover, it is proved that the asymptote of watertable <b>overheight</b> normalised by the tidal amplitude is unit as a controlling parameter (epsilon(0)), combining the aquifer properties and tidal frequency, approaches infinity.

40|$|Three basic bridge {{protection}} schemes were investigated: Rigid passive overhead device, ● Nonrigid passive overhead device, and ● Active {{detection and}} warning system. The first scheme investigated {{was the use}} of an immovable, rigid crossbeam across the road. Thecrossbeam would beset at the clearance of the bridge, and an overweight vehicle would strike the beam, thus warning the driver that the truck wastoohigh for the bridge. Such devices have been used in the past in other states, but, because of their extreme liability, this method was not seriously considered. Inaddition to possible damage to the <b>overheight</b> truck, vehicles traveling behind a log truck are in danger from logs that could be knocked off the truck by the crossbeam. The second scheme investigated {{was the use of}} passive overhead devices that are not rigid and destructive. In some states, items such as chains have been suspended from a span wire in advance of low-clearance obstructions. The noise of the chain striking the top of the overweight vehicle is intended to warn the driver without causing significant damage to the vehicle. However, it was felt that passive overhead devices could not adequately warn the driver of a loud log truck with an <b>overheight</b> load. The third scheme investigated was a system utilizing infrared beam devices located in advance of the bridge, which would detect the overweight vehicle and warn the driver through means of audible bells and/or warning signs with flashing beacons. This scheme was selected for implementation. Warning System Components A system to detect and warn <b>overheight</b> vehicles was designed that incorporated the following five basic parts: ● Advance warning signs of the height restriction, A device to detect <b>overheight</b> vehicles, ● Audible alarm bells that are activated when an <b>overheight</b> vehicle is detected, ● Overhead warning signs with flashing yellow beacons that are activated when an <b>overheight</b> vehicle is detected, an...|$|E
40|$|Bridges {{with low}} {{clearance}} {{are vulnerable to}} collision with <b>overheight</b> vehicles. Collisions of <b>overheight</b> vehicles can cause fatalities and injuries to the drivers and passengers of the <b>overheight</b> vehicles, and damage to bridge girders.

This research investigates the feasibility of developing a bridge bumper that minimizes the physical injuries {{and the likelihood of}} fatalities and protects the structural elements of bridges by absorbing the impact energy. The thesis describes a small-scale impact experiment using the proposed bridge bumper with several options of energy absorbing materials to protect a reinforced concrete beam. A finite element analysis is done to simulate the small-scale impact experiments. Optimization of the finite element model is carried out for the response quantities of interest with respect to the geometrical parameters and the material properties of the proposed bridge bumper.
