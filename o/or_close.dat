5|$|As the goalkeeper has {{the choice}} of how many hands they want to use, the {{decision}} should be made {{of what they want}} to do. A shot should be stopped with two hands either if it is weak <b>or</b> <b>close</b> to the goalkeeper's body, and normally stopped with one in other circumstances. This is because one-handed saves can go to the ball faster.|$|E

5|$|The type {{species of}} this genus is Brancasaurus brancai, first named by Theodor Wegner in 1914 {{in honor of}} German {{paleontologist}} Wilhelm von Branca. Another plesiosaur named from the same region, Gronausaurus wegneri, most likely represents a synonym of this genus. While traditionally considered as a basal member of the Elasmosauridae, Brancasaurus has more recently been recovered as a member, <b>or</b> <b>close</b> relative, of the Leptocleididae, a group containing many other freshwater plesiosaurs.|$|E

5|$|A {{prerequisite}} for natural selection {{to result in}} adaptive evolution, novel traits and speciation {{is the presence of}} heritable genetic variation that results in fitness differences. Genetic variation is the result of mutations, genetic recombinations and alterations in the karyotype (the number, shape, size and internal arrangement of the chromosomes). Any of these changes might have an effect that is highly advantageous or highly disadvantageous, but large effects are rare. In the past, most changes in the genetic material were considered neutral <b>or</b> <b>close</b> to neutral because they occurred in noncoding DNA or resulted in a synonymous substitution. However, many mutations in non-coding DNA have deleterious effects. Although both mutation rates and average fitness effects of mutations are dependent on the organism, a majority of mutations in humans are slightly deleterious.|$|E
5|$|As a point-and-click {{adventure}} game, {{the player}} controls Simon using the mouse. The iOS and Android versions feature touch-screen controls. Gameplay involves moving Simon around and interacting with objects and other characters. The player can make Simon perform actions such as giving an item to another character, talk to another character, {{and pick up}} (add to inventory), examine, use, move, consume, wear, or open <b>or</b> <b>close</b> an item. Some actions are binary: they involve two objects and the player sometimes, after telling Simon to use an item, needs to specify what to use it with. A map that enables Simon to instantly transport to a major landmark (if it has been discovered) is provided. The postcard is used to load, save, or quit the game.|$|E

5|$|Baldwin and {{his group}} arrived at Tyre on 16 September 1190. Richard did not arrive in Syria until 1191. It is unclear exactly why they were sent ahead of the king; perhaps it was {{to look out for}} the king's {{interests}} while Richard took a more leisurely route, or perhaps to rid the king's entourage of a family grouping around Glanvill that the king did not trust. Baldwin was not a member <b>or</b> <b>close</b> associate of the Glanvill faction, so most likely he was sent ahead to look after the king's interests, whatever the reasons for the inclusion of his companions. Another concern may have been to get help to the Kingdom of Jerusalem as quickly as possible after the king learned of Frederick Barbarossa's death {{on the way to the}} Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|Compared to the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy {{appears to}} have {{predominantly}} more old stars with ages >7 years. The estimated luminosity of Andromeda Galaxy, , is about 25% {{higher than that of}} our own galaxy. However, the galaxy has a high inclination as seen from Earth and its interstellar dust absorbs an unknown amount of light, so it is difficult to estimate its actual brightness and other authors have given other values for the luminosity of the Andromeda Galaxy (including to propose it is the second-brightest galaxy within a radius of 10 mega-parsecs of the Milky Way, after the Sombrero Galaxy, with an absolute magnitude of around -22.21 <b>or</b> <b>close).</b>|$|E
5|$|Five Nights at Freddy's 4 reintroduces removed tools, {{specifically}} {{the doors and}} flashlight, albeit with slightly altered usage. The doors can only be closed when the player is next to them, and will re-open if the player moves away. However, if the player shuts the doors too early, the animatronics will jump scare the player when the door is opened. The flashlight can no-longer run out, but only alerts player {{to the presence of}} animatronics as opposed to warding them away, excluding the miniature Freddies that appear on the bed. If the player flashes the flashlight while an animatronic is in the doorway, the player will be jumpscared. There is one new mechanic, where the player must listen for breathing audio. This can determine whether to use the flashlight <b>or</b> <b>close</b> the door.|$|E

5|$|In December 2007 Pacific National {{announced}} plans to sell <b>or</b> <b>close</b> its grain transport and Portlink rural container business operations in Victoria. The decision has been criticised as it will force grain growers to use higher cost road transport to transport the annual grain harvest from rural silos to the ports. The decision has seen many commentators accuse Pacific National of only acquiring the operations of Freight Australia in 2004 {{for the purposes of}} asset stripping and eliminating competition in rail freight. In 2008 El Zorro took over the Warrnambool - Melbourne container service from Pacific National, and moved into broad gauge grain services, while Aurizon has taken over the Melbourne - Horsham container service.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln had {{not been}} asked or {{informed}} about either Vallandigham's arrest or {{the closure of the}} Chicago Times. He remembered the section of General Order No. 38 which declared that offenders would be banished to enemy lines and finally decided {{that it was a good}} idea; so Vallandigham was freed from jail and sent to Confederate hands. Meanwhile, Lincoln ordered the Chicago Times to be reopened and announced that Burnside had exceeded his authority in both cases.

5|$|Most of the {{residential}} areas at Chakokot possess {{one or more}} bottle-shaped underground storage chambers, known as chultunob, with 14 having been found as of 2001. Because of the thick vegetation at the site, investigators consider that there are probably more to be found. These chultunob were closed with disc-shaped stone lids, {{many of which were}} found either still in place <b>or</b> <b>close</b> to the aperture of the chultun to which it belonged. The stone lids were without perforations so it is supposed that the chambers were used to store dry goods rather than water.|$|E
