40|$|Abstract This study aims {{to develop}} {{a model for the}} {{learning}} <b>of</b> <b>early</b> reading-writing to improve students’ reading-writing competencies. The research data were the results of a study <b>of</b> an <b>early</b> reading-writing curriculum, those of a survey on the implementation of and suggestions for the learning <b>of</b> <b>early</b> reading-writing at elementary schools, and those of a tryout of the prototype of a model for the learning <b>of</b> <b>early</b> reading-writing. The study produced: (1) a model of a guideline for the learning <b>of</b> <b>early</b> reading-writing divided into the essence <b>of</b> <b>early</b> reading-writing and strategies in the learning <b>of</b> <b>early</b> readingwriting in the emergent literacy perspective and (2) a model <b>of</b> an <b>early</b> reading-writing magazine using the performance standard with language characteristics, contents, and techniques...|$|R

5|$|According to an {{alternative}} theory, {{popular in the}} earlier 20th century and still represented today, the medieval cultures {{in the area of}} modern Poland are not a result of massive immigration, but emerged from a cultural transition <b>of</b> <b>earlier</b> indigenous populations, who then would need to be regarded as early Slavs. This view has mostly been discarded, primarily due to a period of archaeological discontinuity, during which settlements were absent or rare, and because of cultural incompatibility of the late ancient and early medieval sites.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the film}} {{historian}} Denis Meikle, Robertson, Mamoulian, and Fleming's films followed a pattern set by Sullivan's play: making Hyde's evil sexual and the Jekyll-Hyde transformation central to the performance. Meikle viewed this as a deterioration of Stevenson's original narrative initiated by Sullivan. Later adaptations diverged from the model established by Sullivan and the early films; some returned to Stevenson's novella, and others spun new variations from aspects <b>of</b> <b>earlier</b> versions.|$|E

40|$|Early fetal growth {{delay and}} early {{oligohydramnios}} have been suspected {{as signs of}} embryonal jeopardy. However, little information is available for the prediction <b>of</b> <b>early</b> abortion. Sonographic examination <b>of</b> 111 <b>early</b> pregnancies between the sixth and ninth gestational week with regular, 28 day menstrual cycles was performed to investigate predictable sonographic findings <b>of</b> <b>early</b> abortion. Sonographic measurements of the gestational sac (G-SAC), crown-rump length (CRL) and fetal heart rate (FHR) were performed using a linear array real time transducer with Doppler. All measurements <b>of</b> 17 <b>early</b> abortions were compared to those of 94 normal pregnancies to investigate the objective rules for the screening <b>of</b> <b>early</b> abortion. Most <b>of</b> the <b>early</b> aborted pregnancies were classified correctly by discriminant analysis with G-SAC and CRL (G-SAC = 0. 5222 CRL + 14. 6673 = 0. 5 CRL + 15, sensitivity 76. 5 % specificity 96. 8 %). With the addition of FHR, 94. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>early</b> abortions could be predicted. In conclusion, sonographic findings <b>of</b> <b>early</b> intrauterine growth retardation, early oligohydromnios and bradycardia can be predictable signs for the poor prognosis <b>of</b> <b>early</b> pregnancies...|$|R

However, these elements are destabilized, {{and if they were}} stabilized to more closely match chemistry laws, they would be similar to lanthanides as well. Also, the later actinides from californium onwards behave more like the corresponding lanthanides, with only the valence +3 (and sometimes +2) shown.|$|E

5|$|Inspired by the chronicles <b>of</b> <b>earlier</b> {{travelling}} naturalists, including Alexander von Humboldt, Charles Darwin {{and especially}} William Henry Edwards, Wallace {{decided that he}} too wanted to travel abroad as a naturalist. In 1848, Wallace and Henry Bates left for Brazil aboard the Mischief. Their intention was to collect insects and other animal specimens in the Amazon Rainforest for their private collections, selling the duplicates to museums and collectors back in Britain in order to fund the trip. Wallace also hoped to gather evidence of the transmutation of species.|$|E

Recently, the first direct evidence <b>of</b> <b>earlier</b> Neolithic settlement emerged—shards of pottery of the Hebridean ware style, found to the east of the village. The subsequent discovery of a quarry for stone tools on Mullach Sgar above Village Bay led to finds of numerous stone hoe-blades, grinders and Skaill knives in the Village Bay cleitean—unique stone storage buildings (see below). These tools are also probably of Neolithic origin.|$|E
