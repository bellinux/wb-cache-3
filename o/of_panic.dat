5|$|The tornado {{prediction}} {{proved to}} be successful, even if its precision was mostly due to chance.

5|$|Alprazolam is {{effective}} in the relief of moderate to severe anxiety and panic attacks. However, {{it is not a}} first line treatment since the development of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Alprazolam is no longer recommended in Australia for the treatment <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder due to concerns regarding tolerance, dependence, and abuse. Most evidence shows that the benefits of alprazolam in treating panic disorder last only 4 to 10 weeks. However, people with panic disorder have been treated on an open basis for up to 8 months without apparent loss of benefit.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam, {{available}} {{under the}} trade name Xanax, is a potent, short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic—a minor tranquilizer. It {{is commonly used}} {{for the treatment of}} anxiety disorders, especially <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder, but also in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or social anxiety disorder. It was the 12th most prescribed medicine in the United States in 2010. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, amnestic, and antidepressant properties. Alprazolam is available for oral administration as compressed tablets (CT) and extended-release capsules (XR).|$|E

5|$|Frank Abagnale {{sold the}} film rights to his {{autobiography}} in 1980. Executive Producer Michel Shane purchased the film rights in 1990, for Paramount Pictures. By December 1997, Barry Kemp purchased the film rights from Shane, bringing {{the project to}} DreamWorks, with Jeff Nathanson writing the script. By April 2000, David Fincher was attached to direct {{over the course of}} a few months, but dropped out in favor <b>of</b> <b>Panic</b> Room. In July 2000, Leonardo DiCaprio had entered discussions to star, with Gore Verbinski to direct. Steven Spielberg signed on as producer, and filming was set to begin in March 2001.|$|E
5|$|In several seasons, contestants {{have been}} cast but {{ultimately}} withdrew {{before the game}} began: a 20th contestant, Mellisa McNulty was originally cast in , but dropped out and returned home {{the night before the}} show began because <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> attacks, while in , the 19th and 20th contestants, So and Doo Kim a related couple, were removed just before filming due to a medical emergency. In both cases, the removed contestants were unreplaced. Fiji and San Juan del Sur proceeded with an uneven gender balance. This occurrence made Fiji the only season {{in the history of the}} show to have an odd number of players.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} recordings of vampire activity came from the region of Istria in modern Croatia, in 1672. Local reports cited the local vampire Giure Grando of the village Khring near Tinjan as the cause <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> among the villagers. A former peasant, Guire died in 1656; however, local villagers claimed he returned from the dead and began drinking blood from the people and sexually harassing his widow. The village leader ordered a stake to be driven through his heart, but when the method failed to kill him, he was subsequently beheaded with better results.|$|E

40|$|Models <b>of</b> banking <b>panics</b> {{have the}} {{unsatisfactory}} property that banks can not reduce {{the probability of}} facing runs by holding more liquid assets. This is inconsistent with empirical evidence that suggests that the probability is endogenously determined and negatively related to the liquidity of bank balance sheets. I develop a model consistent with the evidence. There are important empirical implications. Liquidity should be measured by the liquidation value of total assets as a fraction of short term liabilities. Econometric results are obtained for the Argentine <b>panic</b> <b>of</b> 1995. Three government policies are analyzed. First, under a scheme of partial deposit insurance, the probability <b>of</b> <b>panics</b> is increasing {{in the level of}} coverage. Second, the government can reduce the probability <b>of</b> <b>panics</b> and increase depositor’s welfare for a constant expenditure by imposing liquidity requirements. Third, a more capital intensive …nancial structure reduces the probability of runs. Capital requirements reduce the probability <b>of</b> <b>panics</b> and the government expenditure when a panic episode occurs. I am thankful to Carlos Vegh, Amartya Lahiri, Kenneth Sokolo¤, Aaron Tornell and Arnold Harberger for helpful comments and suggestions. I am also thankful to R. Sanchez Baker, J. Wynne, P.

5|$|Alprazolam {{was first}} {{released}} by Upjohn (now {{a part of}} Pfizer) in 1981. The first approved use was <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder, and within two years of its original marketing, Xanax became a blockbuster drug in the US. As of 2010, alprazolam is the most prescribed and the most misused benzodiazepine in the US. The potential for misuse among those taking it for medical reasons is controversial, with some expert reviews stating that the risk is low and {{similar to that of}} other benzodiazepine drugs. Others state that there is a substantial risk of misuse and dependence in both patients and non-medical users and that the high affinity binding, high potency, short elimination half-life, and rapid onset of action may increase the misuse potential of alprazolam. Compared to the large number of prescriptions, relatively few individuals increase their dose on their own initiative or engage in drug-seeking behavior. Alprazolam is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).|$|E
5|$|In La Pintada, {{a remote}} fishing village of around 400residents {{situated}} {{to the west}} of Acapulco, a mudslide occurred on September14, which within a few minutes, swept through the center of town. As such, many residents initially wandered throughout town in a state <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> and confusion; it took two days for word of the mudslide to spread to the public. Throughout the village, 71people were killed. Over half the town, including 20homes, were demolished due to the mudslide. A total of 334people were evacuated by police, though 30elected to stay in the area until all the victims had been identified. Many surviving citizens of La Pintada were also hurt, including one seriously.|$|E
5|$|Lang filmed The Testament of Dr. Mabuse {{at the end}} of 1932 and the {{beginning}} of 1933, desiring to have the film viewed worldwide. In his film, where gun-play, fires, or explosions are needed, Lang often used real weapons. In the opening scene during a power outage, a stunt actor did the gun play. Cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner stated that he spent most of the production in a state <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> due to the way Lang would endanger his crew. The film is generally filmed in a realistic style with the exception of Mabuse's ghostly appearances throughout the film. Lang admitted later in interviews that if he could re-do the film, he would not have included these supernatural scenes.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{this period}} coincided with the {{so-called}} Long Depression, including stock market crashes called the <b>Panic</b> <b>of</b> 1873 and <b>Panic</b> <b>of</b> 1893. A charter for construction of the bridge expired in 1916.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: During {{the late}} forties {{and through the}} fifties the U. S. was swept by a number <b>of</b> <b>panics,</b> <b>of</b> which anti-Commu-nism and {{homophobia}} were prominent. This article examines these fears, and the parallels between them, {{in an effort to}} locate some sources of those anxieties. The article argues that the discourses about homosexuality and Communism became vehi-cles for the expression of concerns that lay closer to home and were more difficult to talk about-in particular, for the expres-sion of fears about the decline of masculinity in the U. S. During the late 1940 s and the 1950 s the U. S. was swept by a variety <b>of</b> <b>panics,</b> most <b>of</b> which, in retrospect, seem more or less irrational. The fear of Communist subversion from within and attack from with-out was the most prominent <b>of</b> these <b>panics,</b> the one that was most systematically promoted by political figures and the mainstream media. But the fear of Communism was accompanied by others: fear...|$|R

5|$|The Quraysh {{veterans}} grew {{impatient with}} the deadlock. A group of militants led by ‘Amr ibn ‘Abd Wudd (who {{was thought to be}} equal to a thousand men in fighting) and Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl attempted to thrust through the trench and managed to effect a crossing, occupying a marshy area near the hillock of Sala. 'Amr challenged the Muslims to a duel. In response, Ali ibn Abi Talib accepted the challenge, and was sent by Muhammad to fight. Both the fighters got lost in the dust as the duel became intense. Finally, the soldiers heard scream(s) which hinted decisive blows, but it was unclear which of the two was successful. The slogan, 'Allahu Akbar' (God is the greatest) from the dust confirmed Ali's victory. The confederates were forced to withdraw in a state <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> and confusion. Although the Confederates lost only three men during the encounter, they failed to accomplish anything important.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Bruges (1375) ensured {{peace for}} two years, but after it expired, {{fighting}} resumed between England and France. In 1377 Edward III was succeeded by Richard II. During the war, England and France struggled {{for control of}} the English Channel, with raids on both coasts. With the renewed hostilities, Parliament voted that money should be spent on defending and fortifying England's south coast, and defences were erected in Kent in anticipation of a French invasion. There was internal unrest as well as external threats, and Dalyngrigge was involved in suppressing the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. The manor of Bodiam was granted a charter in 1383 permitting a weekly market and an annual fair to be held. In 1385, a fleet of 1,200 ships– variously cogs, barges, and galleys– gathered across the English Channel at Sluys, Flanders; the population of southern England was in a state <b>of</b> <b>panic.</b> Later in the year, Edward Dalyngrigge was granted a licence to fortify his manor house.|$|E
5|$|The USS Enterprise {{receives}} a distress call from Dr. Howard Clarke (Paul Lambert), {{the leader of}} a Federation scientific delegation on Ventax II, where the population is in a state <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> because they are convinced that their world will soon end. After the Enterprise arrives, they rescue Dr. Clarke who brings them up to date: a thousand years ago, according to Ventaxian history, the population entered a Faustian deal with Ardra, their mythology's devil. In exchange for ending wars and restoring the ecological balance, and improving their heavily polluted planet, the population would become the personal slaves of Ardra a thousand years later. As the millennium is about to come to a close, the planet has recently begun experiencing mild earthquakes as well as seeing images of Ardra in the skies. These were said to be signs of her arrival.|$|E
50|$|Fed Chair Ben Bernanke {{described}} in November 2013 how the <b>Panic</b> <b>of</b> 1907 {{was essentially a}} run on the non-depository financial system, with many parallels to the crisis of 2008.

5|$|The {{first signs}} <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> were seen {{when a group}} of {{passengers}} attempted to rush port-side lifeboat No.14 as it was being lowered with 40people aboard. Fifth Officer Lowe, {{who was in charge of}} the boat, fired three warning shots in the air to control the crowd without causing injuries. No.16 was lowered five minutes later. Among those aboard was stewardess Violet Jessop, who would repeat the experience four years later when she survived the sinking of one of Titanics sister ships, , in the First World War. Collapsible boat C was launched at 01:40 from a now largely deserted area of the deck, as most of those on deck had moved to the stern of the ship. It was aboard this boat that White Star chairman and managing director J. Bruce Ismay, Titanics most controversial survivor, made his escape from the ship, an act later condemned as cowardice.|$|E
5|$|The {{required}} causation may {{be quite}} oblique. As well as weaponry held in the hand, weaponry thrown is included, as is causing people to touch each other by creating a sense <b>of</b> <b>panic.</b> The general law on liability for omissions also applies to batteries, for example those of the continuing act (as in Fagan v MPC) and of a duty of care. However, in R v Ireland the court ruled out psychological injury {{by means of a}} telephone as a form of battery, although it was not an important point in the case as other charges were brought. Poisoning is not a battery where there is no accompanying violence.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} further deteriorated for Pyrrhus when Areus entered Argos with a {{force of}} 1,000 lightly armed Cretans and Spartans. The Argives, assisted by their Spartan and Macedonian allies, launched a counter-attack on Pyrrhus' Gallic troops in the agora and threw them into a state <b>of</b> <b>panic.</b> Due to the labyrinthine layout {{of the city and}} the darkness, both Pyrrhus' advancing troops and those of his opponents become scattered throughout Argos. The result was that Pyrrhus, entering the city at the head of his cavalry to assist the Gauls, was unable to effectively communicate his commands to his soldiers. Realising the difficulty of his situation, Pyrrhus ordered his army to retreat from Argos as day broke.|$|E
