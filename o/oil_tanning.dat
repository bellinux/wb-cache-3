50|$|The brand {{goes all}} the way back to 1768 when a Russian nobleman called Count Orlof {{commissioned}} a brand of perfume from Bayleys of Bond Street in London. The perfume was called 'Eau de Cologne Imperiale Russe'. Russia leather was a high-quality leather exported widely from Russia and recognisable by a distinctive aroma from its birch <b>oil</b> <b>tanning</b> process. In 1921 Bayleys was acquired by Cussons Sons & Co, chaired by Alexander Tom Cussons. It was not until some years later in 1938 that Alex Cussons used the original perfume and created Cussons Imperial Leather soap and other toiletries. The soap was initially called 'Imperiale Russian Leather', but was soon renamed to Imperial Leather. In 1975 the Cussons Group was itself acquired by Paterson Zochonis, recently renamed to PZ Cussons.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityTanning {{is defined}} as a process of skin {{treatment}} whereby the hot water shrinkage point of the skin is raised, the fibres of the skin substance are prevented from mutually adhering on drying, and the skin substance is protected from putrefaction under ordinary conditions in air. There are various kinds of tanning processes such as vegetable tanning, chrome tanning, formaldehyde tanning, <b>oil</b> <b>tanning</b> and synthetic tanning. In vegetable tanning the materials used for the actual preservation process are obtained from the bark or wood or other parts of various trees or plants. Vegetable tannins may be conveniently divided into three groups. The first of these is the class of depsides or gallotannins which are hydrolysable and yield gallic acid. The second group consists of hydrolysable tannins which yield ellagic acid. The third group consists of non-hydrolysable tannins called phlobatannins. The latter yield red-colored insoluble products called "phlobaphenes" on boiling with acid. Catechin tannin is a phlobatannin and the structure of catechin is known, but not the structure of its tannin. The structure of no phlobatannin is known at present. Many have speculated as to their general structure on very slim evidence and some tannins have been synthesized which appear qualitatively similar to phlobatannins, but no real proof of structure has been forthcoming.

Otter inhabitation is {{affected}} by type, distribution, and density of aquatic habitats and characteristics of human activities. Preceding the settlement of North America by Europeans, otters were prevalent among aquatic habitats {{throughout most of the}} continent. Trapping, loss or degradation of aquatic habitats through filling of wetlands, and development of coal, <b>oil,</b> gas, <b>tanning,</b> timber, and other industries, resulted in extirpations, or declines, in otter populations in many areas. In 1980, an examination conducted on U.S. river otter populations determined they were extirpated in 11 states, and had experienced drastic lapses in 9 others. The most severe population declines occurred in interior regions where fewer aquatic habitats supported fewer otter populations. Although the distribution became reduced in some regions of southern Canada, the only province-wide extirpation occurred on Prince Edward Island.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Oil {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} energy sources for the world and will likely remain so for many decades, even in the most optimistic projection about the growth of alternative energy sources. Petroleum industry nowadays faced a problem when the naphthenic acid (NA) compound naturally present in the acidic crude oil tends to induce corrosion in oil refining process. Total Acid Number (TAN) represent the amount of naphthenic acid in the oil with the permissible limit of <b>TAN</b> in crude <b>oil</b> is less than 1. Various methods had been used to remove NA in crude oil such as dilution and caustic washing. But all methods have their own weakness. Hence, in order to overcome the acidic crude oil problem, a new catalytic deacidification technique will be introduced in this study. Three types of crude: Petronas Penapisan Melaka Heavy Crude (Crude A) and Light Crude (Crude B) and Korean Crude (Crude C) were studied. Parameters studied were dosing amount of basic chemical used, catalyst calcination temperature, and percentage of the basic chemical in the co-solvent. The basic chemical used in this study was ammonia solution in ethylene glycol (NH 3 -EG). By using Ca/Al 2 O 3 catalyst with calcination temperature of 1000 C, the results showed 66. 7 % (1000 mg/L of NH 3 -EG) reduction in TAN for crude A, 53. 9 % reduction for crude B while for crude C the percentage of TAN reduction was 41 % only. Addition of Cu as a dopant in this study had increased the TAN reduction for all three types of crude <b>oil.</b> <b>TAN</b> in crude A (80 % of TAN reduction) and crude B (77 % of TAN reduction) were successfully reduced to less than 1 with only using 1000 mg/L of NH 3 -EG with the aids of Cu/Ca (10 : 90) /Al 2 O 3 catalyst at calcination temperature of 1000 C while for crude C the TAN was still higher than 1 but the percentage of TAN reduction increased to 46 %...|$|R

30|$|The {{effect of}} extra-framework cations on the {{oxidation}} of palm lubricant oil was also studied by performing the TAN analysis, {{by which the}} acidity in oil was contributed by the acidic oxidized compounds such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, and esters [25, 26]. The trend of TAN analysis (Fig.  5 b) {{was found to be}} similar to the colorimetry observation. For example, the reference oil showed a slow increase in TAN values before 200 h, and its acidity increased abruptly after 200 h until the highest TAN value was recorded after 400 h (42.83 mg KOH/g oil). In contrary, the extra-framework cations effectively lowered down the TAN values of the oils. The acidity of the oils was significantly reduced by four to seven times compared to that of the reference oil after 400 h of oxidation. Typically, Na+-, K+-, and Ca 2 +-LTL had comparable performance in controlling the TAN values (6.72 – 8.75 mg KOH/g oil) whereas Li-LTL, which possessed the lowest cation polarizability (0.03 × 10 − 24 cm 3), had the lowest effect in halting oil oxidation (13.92 mg KOH/g <b>oil</b> of <b>TAN</b> was recorded after 400 h).|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a detailed geochemical {{evaluation of the}} petroleum fluids in the Greater Birba Area in the South Oman Salt Basin located in South of Sultanate Oman. These crude oils {{were found in the}} Infracambrian (Precambrian-Cambrian) Ara group carbonates (Upper Huqf supergroup), which are sealed by anhydrites. The reservoirs are heavily shattered due to halokinetic movement and so the migration of oil to these sealed carbonate slabs was probably vertical through these halokinetic faults. The Greater Birba area oils are characterized by large variations in some of the important properties. API gravity ranges from 23. 70 to 51. 00. Dead oil and live oil viscosities vary a lot from a minimum of 1. 50 cp and 0. 92 cp to a maximum of 188 cp and 41. 03 cp respectively. The acidity of the <b>oil</b> (<b>TAN)</b> varies from a low TAN of 0. 11 mgKOH/g oil to a high TAN value of 1. 24 mgKOH/g oil. Most of the <b>oils</b> show high <b>TAN</b> values (> 0. 50) and only few <b>oils</b> show low <b>TAN</b> values. Sulphur content also varies a lot and ranges from 0. 78 wt% in a black oil to 4. 7 wt% in a gas condensates and generally negatively correlated with API gravity. Therefore, an important aim {{of this study was to}} improve the understanding of the underlying controls on these properties using both geochemistry and PVT modelling. A comprehensive study was undertaken on these oils using twenty two oil samples, twenty reservoir core samples, five gas samples and data from eleven PVT reports. Hydrocarbons molecular geochemistry, gasoline range hydrocarbon data, bulk composition and isotopic data as well as PVT modelling were employed in this study to evaluate and characterize crude oils and attempt to identify the controls on observed fluid properties variations in the Greater Birba area. Most of the crude oils in the Greater Birba area show typical characteristics of oils sourced from evaporite-carbonate source facies deposited in hypersaline and highly reducing environment, except for two oil samples, one from BBNl (from A 3 C reservoir unit), which might be contaminated and the other is from Kaukabl (from A 1 C reservoir unit). Some of these characteristics are high sulphur content, low asphaltene contents, high relative abundance of Pregnanes, gammacerane, and C 35 homohopanes as well as other geochemical features. Various maturity parameters (e. g. MPI and C 29 (S+R) aPPI (aaa+app) in CI 5 + Saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons suggested that these oils were generated from a source rock in the middle of oil window (O. 8 - 0. 9 %R). No evidence was found for water washing and biodegradation effects in the studied oils. There was no evidence to prove or deny thermochemical or bacterial sulphate reduction, although general observations suggest that this is less likely to occur in the Greater Birba area. Number of facies sensitive parameters and maturity sensitive parameters as well as isotopic data show that these oils are genetically related and only minor variations exist between them, largely due to minor facies variations. These small variations can not account for the large variations observed in bulk properties. Two samples were exceptional from the above statement 05 from BBNl (reservoir A 3 C), which is probably a contaminated sample with most likely younger oil and 015 from Kaukab 1 (reservoir Al C) and this is different because it is from Al C reservoir unit which is in contact with middle Huqf source rocks. PVT modelling, gasoline range hydrocarbons data and absolute concentrations of biomarkers suggest that the main control behind the variations observed in the petroleum fluids in the Greater Birba area were mixing of oil and gas condensate with a dry gas probably derived from highly mature pre-salt source rocks. This oilcondensate- gas mixing increased the bubble point pressure above reservoir pressure in some of the oil accumulation in the studied area (e. g. main Birba Field), which resulted in the formation of two phases in these accumulations. Sulphur content was probably controlled by both oil-condensate mixing and the minor facies variations between the original oils. The variations in the absolute concentrations of biomarkers in the oils were mainly controlled by dilution effects caused by mixing of oils with alkane rich condensate charge. The formation of a gas phase and related Phase fractionation effects might be responsible for the significant variations in acidity, API gravity and the distribution of alkylphenols. Birba oils (A 4 C oils of well BB 1, and BB 2) were suggested to have migrated longer distance than the other oils on the basis of alkylcarbazoles isomer distribution.

40|$|The {{composition}} and properties of crude oils {{have been subjected}} to much scrutinization over the past decades due to the decreasing oil quality and thus increasingly difficult oil recovery. The physical properties of crude oils are found to be very dependent on the chemical composition. This complex relationship is important to understand in order to predict what EOR method is best suited for one specific oil type. The aim of this work has been to improve the understanding of how polar components in a crude oil will affect physiochemical properties such as interfacial tension, contact angle and zeta potential. These physiochemical properties measurements are important factors in reservoir interactions. Due to the complex nature of the crude oil composition, fractionation by chemical properties was used to simplify the characterization of polar compounds. The asphaltene fraction was recovered by precipitation with n-hexane. The maltene oil was fractionated into four increasingly polar fractions by SPE-LC. These fractions were further analyzed by FT-IR and 31 P NMR. The 31 P NMR analytical technique was utilized {{for the first time in}} the analysis of crude oils. It was found to have an interesting potential in the molecular characterization of polar compounds. In addition to chemical composition, the biodegradation ranks and TAN were found for each crude oil. The physiochemical properties measured by Kolltveit, and the chemical component data obtained in this thesis, were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA). The analysis revealed that the heavier and more biodegraded oils consisted of more carboxylic acid functional groups, while the lighter, non-biodegraded contained more aliphatic alcohols and phenolic functional groups. The physiochemical properties were found to be less dependent on the amount of TAN and more dependent on the chemical composition of the acids present in the crude <b>oils.</b> The <b>TAN</b> was found to be independent of the asphaltenes, indicating that the acids are present in both the maltene and asphaltene fractions...|$|R

In crude oil, naphthenic acids exist as a complex mixture of compounds with broad polydispersity with respect to both molecular weight and structure. There has been increasing interest in the naphthenic acids in crude oil because of the corrosion problems that cause during oil refining. Herein, two powerful analytical tools, negative-ion electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, ESI(-) FT-ICR MS and atomic force microscopy (AFM), were combined to monitor the thermal degradation of naphthenic acids and their corrosion effects on AISI 1020 steel, respectively. Two different acidic crude oils (TAN= 2. 38 and 4. 79 mgKOHg− 1, and total sulfur= 0. 7993 and 1. 0220 wt%) have been submitted to thermal treatment at 280, 300 and 350 °C during 2, 4 and 6 h, and characterized by ESI(-) -FT-ICR MS, total acid number (TAN), and total sulfur. The AISI 1020 steel was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and AFM. Generally, heating the crude oil at 350 °C in a period of 6 h, it was observed that a high efficiency (≅ 80 %) and selectivity of thermal decarboxylation process was monitored by decay of TAN (4. 79 → 0. 44 mgKOHg− 1).

40|$|It was {{established}} that olefin cracker and gasification technologies provide solutions to today's refineries by marketing unwanted, heavy, high sulfur, TAN materials though environmentally benign, highly valuable productions. To a refinery, these technologies offer reaction operations like hydrocracking, catalytic reforming etc. However, they convert the various fractions of oils including heavy, high sulfur, <b>TAN</b> <b>oils</b> to more valuable primary petrochemicals, hydrogen, power, and energy. Due to high investment and maintenance costs {{of these two}} processes their applications are limited to refineries. However, in recent years when the environmental legislations on fuel qualities and emissions demand a complete disposal of bottom fractions into sustainable products, while ensuring a steady economic gain, integration of these two technologies to refineries {{seems to be the}} most promising option. Economic justification is achieved in the following ways. A high valued product slate consisting of polymer grade olefins (ethylene, propylene), hydrogen, transportation fuels (gasoline, diesel), power and energy with significantly lower emissions is resulted from complete bottom of barrel disposal. No heavy products, fuel oils, residues are produced having lower value than crude oils. Today's refinery should ideally employ a limited number of selective technologies: crude distillation, hydrotreating, olefin cracking, resid processing (e. g. solvent deasphalting, delayed coking), integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC). Use of advanced process integration tools and development of process technologies particularly in the areas of olefin cracking, IGCC offer additional prospects of economic growth in refineries.

Setting 20 state secondary schools in one Scottish local authority (Glasgow City). Participants 2173 adolescents (females: 50. 7 %, n= 1102) {{with a mean}} age of 12. 4 (SD= 0. 55). Outcome measures Sun-related behaviour (suntan, sunbathing, sunburn, sunscreen use, sunbed use), tanning attitudes, skin cancer-related symptom and risk factor awareness. Results Adolescents reported poor sun-related practice: 51 % of adolescents reported sunburn the previous summer of whom 38 % indicated sunburn on more than one occasion. Skin cancer awareness was low: 45 % recognised â��change in the appearance of a moleâ�� as a cancer symptom, and 39 % agreed that â��getting sunburnt more than once as a childâ�� increased cancer risk. 42 % and 26 % of adolescents, respectively, reported that friends and family held protanning attitudes. Compared with males, females were statistically significantly more likely to: report sunbathing (p< 0. 001), use of lotions or <b>oil</b> to aid <b>tanning</b> (p= 0. 009) and sunburn (p< 0. 001); know that changes in the appearance of a mole was a skin cancer symptom (p= 0. 036) and sunburn more than once as a child was a skin cancer risk factor (p= 0. 005); perceive their friends to hold protanning attitudes (p< 0. 001) and indicate that a tan made them feel better about themselves (p< 0. 001), more attractive to others (p= 0. 011) and healthier (p< 0. 001). Conclusions Scottish adolescents had poor sun protection practice and low skin cancer awareness. Girls adopted riskier sun-related behaviour despite greater awareness of skin cancer-related risk. Urgent action is required to promote positive sun-related behaviour and increase skin cancer awareness among Scottish adolescents. However, further research is needed to inform the development of effective sun-safe interventions...|$|R
30|$|Activated carbon, {{a widely}} used {{adsorbent}} in industrial processes, {{is composed of}} a microporous, homogenous structure with high surface area and shows radiation stability (Iqbal and Ashiq 2007; Mittal et al. 2010 a, b). The process for producing efficient activated carbon is not completely investigated in developing countries. Furthermore, there are many problems with the regeneration of used activated carbon (Gupta and Nayak 2012). Nowadays, {{there is a great}} interest in finding inexpensive and effective alternatives to the existing commercial activated carbon (CAC) (Al-Othman et al. 2013). Exploring effective and low cost activated carbon may contribute to environmental sustainability and offer benefits for future commercial applications (Gupta et al. 2011 a, b). The costs of activated carbon prepared from biomaterials are very low compared to the cost of CAC (Gupta and Nayak 2012). Waste materials that have been successfully used to manufacture activated carbon in the recent past include waste wood (Acharya et al. 2009), bagasse (Tsai et al. 2001), coir pith (Namasivayam and Kavitha 2002), orange peel (Khaled et al. 2009), Moringa oleifera tree (Kansal and Kumari 2014, Reddy et al. 2010), coffee husk (Ahmad and Rahman 2011), pine cone (Gecgel and Kolancilar 2012), mango peels (Bello and Ahmad 2011 b); rice husk (Yahaya et al. 2010 a, b, 2011 a, b); periwinkle shell (Bello et al. 2008; Bello and Ahmad 2011 c, d); coconut shell (Bello and Ahmad 2012 b); Imperata cylindrica leaf (Bello and Semire 2012); rubber seed coat (Bello and Ahmad 2012 a); banana stalk (Bello et al. 2012 a); groundnut hulls (Bello et al. 2012 b); ackee apple (Blighia sapida) seeds (Bello et al. 2013 a, b); oil palm fruit fibre (Bello 2013); coconut tree (Senthilkumaar et al. 2006), sunflower seed hull (Thinakaran et al. 2008), pine-fruit shell (Royer et al. 2009), hazelnut husks, rice hulls, <b>oil</b> palm shell (<b>Tan</b> et al. 2008), and Coconut husk (Foo and Hameed 2012).|$|R
40|$|Cocoa is {{a classic}} Third World cash crop. It is {{produced}} mostly by small, poor farmers in Africa, while its products - chocolate and sun <b>tan</b> <b>oil</b> - are consumed by rich consumers in North America and Europe. A few West African economies are highly dependent on foreign exchange earned from cocoa sales. It has therefore been targeted by Oxfam's Fair Trade initiative, and IITA's Sustainable Tree Crops Program (STCP) is launching an effort of become more aligned with consumer's social preferences. The most obvious dimension to addressing consumer demand for cocoa products is to insure provision of high quality products, which has become problematic since structural adjustment programs have dismantled the African parastatals governing cocoa production and exports. Cocoa production would also likely meet requirements for organic certification in many instances, but legitimately obtaining that certification would be costly. Cocoa also offers several dimensions through which consumers might, by their market choices, insure more socially responsible outcomes. Both the STCP and Fair Trade initiatives focus on the potential for poverty alleviation and on achieving sustainable development for poor African farmers. Those farmers are stewards of the rain forest, and their production decisions can determine whether cocoa remains a rain forest friendly crop, so global environmental impacts can also be influenced by cocoa markets. The most recent, most widely publicized, and most intractable issue to hit the cocoa market is the allegation that child labor may be used on those poor African cocoa farms. The first objective of this paper will be to describe this situation, and the problems of cocoa markets, focusing on what has been happening in Africa. Particular attention will {{be paid to the}} problems of implementing structural adjustment reforms, and the increasing role played by multi-national processors as they backward integrate into the African marketing systems. Then the Fair Trade and STCP initiatives will be described. Finally, a conceptual examination of marketing systems between the African cocoa farm and the chocolate manufacturer, emphasizing institutional arrangements, is used to assess the likely success of these initiatives in achieving their social goals.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{a literature}} review {{to assess the}} acidity characteristics of the older mineral oil and newer polyolester (POE) refrigeration systems {{as well as to}} evaluate acid measuring techniques used in other non-aqueous systems which may be applicable for refrigeration systems. Failure in the older chlorofluorocarbon/hydrochlorofluorocarbon (CFC/HCFC) / mineral oil systems was primarily due to thermal degradation of the refrigerant which resulted in the formation of hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids. These are strong mineral acids, which can, over time, severely corrode the system metals and lead to the formation of copper plating on iron surfaces. The oil lubricants used in the older systems were relatively stable and were not prone to hydrolytic degradation due to the low solubility of water in oil. The refrigerants in the newer hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) /POE systems are much more thermally stable than the older CFC/HCFC refrigerants and mineral acid formation is negligible. However, acidity is produced in the new systems by hydrolytic decomposition of the POE lubricants with water to produce the parent organic acids and alcohols used to prepare the POE. The individual acids can therefore vary but they are generally C 5 to C 9 carboxylic acids. Organic acids are much weaker and far less corrosive to metals than the mineral acids from the older systems but they can, over long time periods, react with metals to form carboxylic metal salts. The salts tend to accumulate in narrow areas such as capillary tubes, particularly if residual hydrocarbon processing chemicals are present in the system, which can lead to plugging. The rate of acid production from POEs varies on a number of factors including chemical structure, moisture levels, temperature, acid concentration and metals. The hydrolysis rate of reaction can be reduced by using driers to reduce the free water concentration and by using scavenging chemicals which react with the system acids. Total acid number (TAN), which includes both mineral acids and organic acids, is therefore a useful indicator which can be used to monitor the condition of the system in order to perform remedial maintenance, when required, to prevent system failure. The critical TAN value is the acid level at which remedial action should be taken to prevent the onset of rapid acid formation which can result in system failure. The level of 0. 05 mg KOH/g of oil was established for CFC/mineral oil systems based on analysis of 700 used lubricants from operating systems and failed units. There is no consensus within the refrigeration industry as to the critical TAN value for HFC/POE systems, however, the value will be higher than the CFC/mineral <b>oil</b> systems critical <b>TAN</b> value because of the much weaker organic acids produced from POE. A similar study of used POE lubricants should be performed to establish a critical TAN limit for POE systems. Titrimetric analysis per ASTM procedures is the most commonly used method to determine TAN values in lubricants in the refrigeration industry and other industries dealing with lubricating oils. For field measurements, acid test kits are often used since they provide rapid, semi-quantitative TAN results...|$|R
