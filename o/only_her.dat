5|$|During the duel between Vengeur and Brunswick, the {{undamaged}} HMS Ramillies {{had approached}} and put {{herself in a}} favourable position to rake Vengeur, and was waiting for Brunswick to separate to open fire. When she did so, Ramillies fired two broadsides, leaving Vengeur with <b>only</b> <b>her</b> foremast standing, which fell half an hour later. Ramillies sustained some damage herself. Soon afterwards, seawater inundated the powder room of Vengeur, denying her all means of defence, and 250 of her crew were out of action. The Trente-et-un Mai closed in around 3:30, attempting to provide assistance, but the proximity of several British sails endangered her so that she eventually sailed away.|$|E
5|$|El Oriente resumed cargo {{service with}} the Morgan Line, and enjoyed a quiet career, {{typically}} sailing between New York and Galveston. One event of note occurred in February 1922 when El Oriente {{came upon the}} wreck of the schooner, Caldwell H. Colt, which had run aground on a reef near the Tortugas Light during a gale. When El Oriente came upon the hulk, <b>only</b> <b>her</b> captain remained alive, surviving without food or water for several days before his rescue.

5|$|Most of Karen's {{appearances}} {{in the first four}} seasons depict her as a large, blue monitor in the Chum Bucket's laboratory; at other times, <b>only</b> <b>her</b> voice is heard from within Plankton's robotic creations. In The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, a mobile unit is introduced to allow Karen to interact more easily with others. Showrunner Vincent Waller stated that the mobile unit was introduced because having Karen able to move was more convenient for storytelling purposes. Karen alternates between her multiple forms in most episodes produced after the film. As of the tenth season, her wall monitor is no longer used and her mobile form is always equipped with a pair of robotic arms.|$|E
5|$|Neumann {{delivered}} {{a letter from}} the queen to Grover Cleveland, who began his second non-consecutive term as president on March 4. The Cleveland administration commissioned the Blount Report, and based on its findings, concluded that the overthrow of Liliʻuokalani was illegal, and that Stevens and American military troops had acted inappropriately in support of those who carried out the overthrow. On November 16, Cleveland sent his minister Albert S. Willis to propose a return of the throne to Liliʻuokalani if she granted amnesty to everyone responsible. Her first response was that Hawaiian law called for property confiscation and the death penalty for treason, and that <b>only</b> <b>her</b> cabinet ministers could put aside the law in favor of amnesty.|$|E
5|$|Neuner was {{scheduled}} to compete at the junior world championships in 2007. However, following her first World Cup win, she was instead appointed for the senior World Championships in Antholz, Italy. On 3 February 2007, she won gold in the sprint, beating Sweden's Anna Carin Olofsson by 2.3seconds. It was her first world championship event ever and <b>only</b> <b>her</b> second victory at senior level. One day later, she also claimed the pursuit title, in spite of four shooting errors. Following a 14th place in the mass start, Neuner, alongside Martina Beck, Andrea Henkel and Kati Wilhelm, also won gold in the relay race on 11 February 2007. With three titles, she was the championship's most successful athlete and became the youngest triple world champion.|$|E

50|$|The Tick-Tockster is Gertie's superhero alter-ego, and {{is another}} one of Captain Stomper's superhero friends. An active giant clock was <b>her</b> <b>only</b> attire. <b>Her</b> superpower merely focuses on forward and/or reverse motion, {{confusing}} those around her.|$|R

5|$|Saya's {{battles with}} the Elder Bairns become {{increasingly}} desperate {{as they begin}} attacking during the day, and both Nene and Nono fall victim, leaving Saya deeply hurt. Shinichirō eventually learns of Saya's burden and offers to help, but is later killed himself. An attack on Saya's school results in everyone but Saya and Itsuki dying before Saya can kill the attacking Elder Bairn. Saya later realizes that <b>only</b> <b>her</b> class and their teacher Kanako {{were present in the}} school. Due to the blanks in her memory and comments from the Elder Bairns, she begins questioning her identity and mission.|$|E
5|$|Several of {{the large}} runestones in Scandinavia notify of an inheritance, such as the Hillersjö stone, which {{explains}} how a lady came to inherit the property of not <b>only</b> <b>her</b> children but also her grandchildren and the Högby Runestone, which tells that a girl was the sole heir {{after the death of}} all her uncles. They are important proprietary documents from a time when legal decisions were not yet put to paper. One interpretation of the Tune Runestone from Østfold suggests that the long runic inscription deals with the funeral ale in honor of the master of a household and that it declares three daughters to be the rightful heirs. It is dated to the 5th century and is, consequently, the oldest legal document from Scandinavia that addresses a female's right to inheritance.|$|E
5|$|The Queen (voiced by Susanne Blakeslee) is {{the main}} villain in the 2005 direct-to-video {{animated}} film Once Upon a Halloween, but appears only in the Witch version despite misleading cover art (furthermore, <b>only</b> <b>her</b> shadow is shown). In it, the Queen plots to conquer Halloween and asks her cauldron to show several villains to which one of them helps her in her plan. The cauldron also explains its origins as {{it is one of}} the cauldrons formerly owned by the three witches from The Black Cauldron. Eventually, the cauldron turns against the Wicked Queen and makes her vanish into nothingness.|$|E

5|$|The {{canonical}} five murders were perpetrated at night, on {{or close}} to a weekend, either {{at the end of}} a month or a week (or so) after. The mutilations became increasingly severe as the series of murders proceeded, except for that of Stride, whose attacker may have been interrupted. Nichols was not missing any organs; Chapman's uterus was taken; Eddowes had her uterus and a kidney removed and her face mutilated; and Kelly's body was eviscerated and her face hacked away, though <b>only</b> <b>her</b> heart was missing from the crime scene.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Beyoncé {{performing}} a simple dance routine {{surrounded by a}} wall of mirrors and then undressing until she is naked behind a white curtain, revealing <b>only</b> <b>her</b> silhouette. Beyoncé enters the club with a different outfit and hairstyle and some friends. Male patrons seated at the tables look on. She and Usher notice each other. They meet {{on the dance floor}} and dance intimately. Beyoncé performs an elaborate dance scene with female backing dancers. She swirls around in a champagne glass filled with bubbles. In the final scene, Beyoncé sits atop a piano and after being lifted down by a gentleman, she dances and poses as confetti falls everywhere.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Knowles laying on a table, lit with a {{flashing}} bright red light. While a siren is blaring, she half-stands and sings while {{dancing on the}} table. She proceeds to an interrogation room {{similar to the one}} in the film Basic Instinct. Knowles sings the first verse in a house with a seashore backdrop. She wants to escape, and struggles with masked and uniformed guards in a hallway. She is then returned to the interrogation room. In between cuts, she sings in a corner of a room, is seen reflected in a mirror while screaming, and among a group of reporters. As the song closes, Knowles is shown crying. The video ends with a close-up view of Knowles putting on red lipstick. The scene shows <b>only</b> <b>her</b> lips.|$|E

5|$|Tina later {{credited}} the Nichiren Buddhist {{faith and}} chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo with {{giving her the}} courage to strike out on her own. However, by walking out on Ike {{in the middle of}} a tour, she learned she was legally responsible to tour promoters for the canceled shows. After a year in court, their divorce was made final on March 29, 1978. In the divorce, she completely parted ways with him, retaining <b>only</b> <b>her</b> stage name and assuming responsibility for the debts incurred by the canceled tour as well as a significant Internal Revenue Service lien.|$|E
5|$|After completion, {{the ship}} was {{assigned}} to Rear Admiral David Porter's Mississippi Squadron and patrolled the Mississippi River against Confederate raids and ambushes. During the Red River Campaign Osage was commanded by Lieutenant Commander Thomas O. Selfridge, Jr. She supported the Union Army when it captured Fort DeRussy and captured Alexandria, Louisiana by herself on 15 March 1864 without firing a shot. She successfully defended the navy transports attacked during the Battle of Blair's Landing on 12 April, driving off the Confederate forces with heavy losses after having run aground and freed herself. After {{the end of the}} campaign in May she was assigned to patrol the Mississippi River. During that month she grounded on a sandbar near Helena, Arkansas and could not be refloated due to the rapidly falling water level even when some of her armor was removed. As the water receded Osage began to hog at the ends because <b>only</b> <b>her</b> middle was supported by the sand. This caused her longitudinal bulkheads to split and broke many rivets in her hull and on her deck. She was repaired in place before being refloated at the end of November.|$|E
5|$|Aoyama collapses {{from the}} drug. Asami injects {{him with a}} paralytic agent that leaves his nerves alert, and tortures him with needles. She tells him that just like {{everyone}} else in her life, he has failed to love <b>only</b> <b>her.</b> She cannot tolerate his feelings for anyone else, even his own son. She inserts needles into his eyes, giggling as she does so. She then cuts off his left foot with piano wire. Shigehiko returns home as Asami begins to cut off Aoyama's other foot, and she chases him upstairs. As she attacks the boy, Aoyama appears to suddenly wake up back in the hotel after he and Asami had sex, and his current ordeal seems to be only a nightmare; Aoyama proposes marriage and Asami accepts. As he falls back asleep in the hotel, he returns to find his son fighting back Asami, who is brandishing mace. Shigehiko kicks her downstairs, breaking her neck. Aoyama tells his son to call the police and stares at the dying Asami, who repeats what she said on one of their dates about her excitement on seeing him again.|$|E
5000|$|The {{narrator is}} telling his lover that he <b>only</b> misses <b>her</b> on days that end in [...] "Y".
