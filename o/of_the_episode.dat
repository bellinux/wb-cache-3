5|$|The {{first part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>episode</b> {{was written by}} Al Septien and Turi Meyer, whereas the second half was written by Peterson and Souders.

Souders later explained that the script had been finalized when Rosenbaum agreed to return to the series. As such, this forced the writers to redo parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>episode</b> to make room for his character. The work was so stressful, Souders said, that she experienced heart palpitations due to exhaustion, excitement, and the emotion of the experience.|$|E
