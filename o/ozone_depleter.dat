50|$|Plastic mulch is {{a product}} used, {{in a similar fashion}} to mulch, to {{suppress}} weeds and conserve water in crop production and landscaping. Certain plastic mulches also act as a barrier to keep methyl bromide, both a powerful fumigant and <b>ozone</b> <b>depleter,</b> in the soil. Crops grow through slits or holes in thin plastic sheeting. Plastic mulch is often used in conjunction with drip irrigation. Some research has been done using different colors of mulch to affect crop growth. This method is predominant in large-scale vegetable growing, with millions of acres cultivated under plastic mulch worldwide each year. Disposal of plastic mulch is cited as an environmental problem; however, technologies exist to provide for the recycling of used/disposed plastic mulch into viable plastic resins for re-use in the plastics manufacturing industry.|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{economic}} impact of a ban on methyl bromide on the U. S. winter fresh vegetable market for six major crops: tomatoes, green peppers, cucumbers, squash, eggplant, and watermelons. Florida is the primary domestic supplier of these products. Mexico and Texas are the competing suppliers of the five vegetable crops and peppers, respectively. Leontief technologies represent both monocrop and double-crop production systems; linear inverse demand functions represent four demand regions in the U. S. and Canada. By increasing production costs and reducing yields, a ban on methyl bromide decreases Florida’s FOB revenues by fit~. and increases those of Mexico by 65 fZ 0. Price increases to U. S. fresh vegetable consumers range from near zero to over 10 Yo,depending upon the commodity and location. Key Words: fresh vegetables, methyl bromide, pesticide, quadratic programming, spatial equilibrium. Methyl bromide is a broad-spectrum pesticide used in the production and marketing of a wide array of fruit and vegetable crops. It has been designated as a Class I <b>ozone</b> <b>depleter</b> and, as such, must be phased out of use by the year 2000. The {{purpose of this study is}} to present an economic analysis of the impact of the proposed methyl bromide ban on the U. S. winter fresh vegetable market.

2500|$|Despite {{optimized}} yields {{greater than}} 95% with excellent purity, the synthesis has shortcomings. Due to high reaction temperature, approximately 5% of the acetic acid solvent is lost by decomposition or [...] "burning". Solvent burning {{is a significant}} economic factor in the oxidation process. In addition, product loss by decarboxylation to benzoic acid is common. The high temperature diminishes oxygen solubility in an already oxygen-starved system. Pure oxygen cannot {{be used in the}} traditional system due to hazards of flammable organic–O2 mixtures. Atmospheric air can be used in its place, but once reacted needs to be purified of toxins and <b>ozone</b> <b>depleters</b> such as methylbromide before being released. Additionally, the corrosive nature of bromides at high temperatures requires the reaction be run in expensive titanium reactors.|$|R

The fact that the products manufactured by many of these companies are sophisticated military electronics only serves to broaden the scope, of the problem. At Westinghouse we have approached this problem by: 1) quantifying as accurately as possible the level of usage of ozone depleting materials, 2) creating a focal point foc information dissemination regarding alternative materials and processes, 3) pooling both capital and human resources, 4) empowering engineers to solve replacement challenges in thek fields of expertise, and 5) involving Corporate research and development.

50|$|Alternatives to Halon 1301 in fire {{extinguishing}} systems are being deployed. Many installations from which halon is removed can be protected with fire sprinklers, depending {{on the level of}} damage the equipment in the space will incur by exposure to water. In other cases, different total flooding agents can be used. The alternatives for normally occupied areas include (PFC-410 or CEA-410), C3F8 (PFC-218 or CEA-308), HCFC Blend A (NAF S-III), HFC-23 (FE 13), HFC-227ea (FM 200), IG-01 (argon), IG-55 (argonite), HFC-125, or HFC-134a. For normally unoccupied areas, the alternatives include carbon dioxide, powdered Aerosol C, CF3I, HCFC-22, HCFC-124, HFC-125, HFC-134a, gelled halocarbon/dry chemical suspension (PGA), blend of inert gas, high expansion foam systems and powdered aerosol (FS 0140), and IG-541 (Inergen).Perfluorocarbons, i.e., PFCs such as C3F8, have very long atmospheric lifetimes and very high global warming potentials. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons, i.e., HCFCs including HCFC containing NAF S-III, contain chlorine and are stratospheric <b>ozone</b> layer <b>depleters,</b> although less so than Halon 1301. Their selection for usage as Halon replacements should consider those factors, and is restricted in some countries.|$|R
40|$|MB is {{the only}} {{fumigant}} available for quarantine treatment of commodities for which rapid disinfestation techniques and a very high degree of insect mortality are essential. The loss of MB could have a significant negative impact on world agriculture, particularly because no available alternatives to MB currently exist for rapid disinfestation of commodities. Thus, there is a critical need to develop new fumigants for quarantine purposes. Propylene oxide (PPO) is commonly used as a sterilant to reduce bacteria, mould and yeast contamination on processed spices, cocoa and processed nutmeats except peanuts. Several reports on insect toxicity indicated that PPO would be an effective replacement for methyl bromide in some postharvest situations (Creasy and Hartsell, 1999; Griffith, 1999; Isikber et al., 2001; Zettler et al., 2002; Navarro et al., 2004). PPO is a liquid fumigant under normal temperature pressure (NTP) with a boiling point of 35 ºC and a noticeable ether odor (Weast et al., 1986). As a fumigant, PPO has reduced environmental risks compared with methyl bromide. It is not an <b>ozone</b> <b>depleter</b> and it degrades into nontoxic propylene glycol in the soil and in the human stomach. Human health and environmental effects of PPO are reviewed in Meylan et al. (1986). A disadvantage of PPO {{is that it is}} flammable from 3 % to 37 % in ai...|$|E
40|$|Ethylene oxide (EtO) {{is widely}} used by health care {{institutions}} as a sterilant because of its potency in destroying pathogens. A few facilities use pure EtO, {{but the vast majority}} employ a “ 12 / 88 ” mixture of Et 0 and Chloroflourocarbon (CFC 1), primarily to improve safety. Use of Et 0 sterilizers is of regulatory concern because:. Et 0 is flammable and explosive. Et 0 is a probable human carcinogen. Et 0 is a toxic air contaminant. CFC is an <b>ozone</b> <b>depleter</b> Pure Et 0 is a colorless gas at room temperature. It has an extremely wide explosive range of 3 to 100 volume percent in air. The flash point is- 4 0 F (Sax, 1984). California classifies Et 0 as a toxic air contaminant, and regulates emissions sterilizers accordingly. At present, EPA does not regulate Et 0 sterilizers. However, the phase-out of CFCs will affect a majority of the users. In Southern California, the use of CFCs as a diluent must cease by January 1, 1997 (SCAQMD 1990). Switching from 12 / 88 to pure Et 0 would permit continued usage of this chemical, but would greatly increase the safety hazard. This fact sheet presents some of the environmental issues with Et 0 sterilizers and presents some alternatives to the use of Et 0 as a sterilant.

40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is an {{important}} greenhouse gas and <b>ozone</b> <b>depleter,</b> but the global budget of N 2 O remains unbalanced. Currently, ~ 25 % of the global N 2 O emission is ascribed to uncultivated tropical soils, but the exact locations and controlling mechanisms are not clear. Here we present the first study of soil N 2 O emission from the Pantanal indicating that this South American wetland may be a significant natural source of N 2 O. At three sites, we repeatedly measured in situ fluxes of N 2 O and sampled porewater nitrate (NO 3 -) during the low water season in 2008 and 2009. In 2010, ten sites were screened for in situ fluxes of N 2 O and soil NO 3 - content. The in situ fluxes of N 2 O were comparable to fluxes from heavily fertilized forests or agricultural soils. An important parameter affecting N 2 O emission rate was precipitation, inducing peak emissions of > 3 mmol N 2 O m- 2 d- 1, while the mean daily flux was 0. 43 &# 177; 0. 03 mmol N 2 O m- 2 d- 1. Over 170 days of the drained period, we estimated non-wetted drained soil to contribute 70. 0 mmol N 2 O m- 2, while rain-induced peak events contributed 9. 2 mmol N 2 O m- 2, {{resulting in a total}} N 2 O emission of 79. 2 mmol N 2 O m- 2. At the sites of repeated sampling, the pool of porewater nitrate varied (0. 002 - 7. 1 &# 181;mol NO 3 - g dw- 1) with higher concentrations of NO 3 - (p < 0. 05) found in drained soil than in water-logged soil, indicating dynamic shifts between nitrification and denitrification. In the field, O 2 penetrated the upper 60 cm of drained soil, but was depleted in response to precipitation. Upon experimental wetting the soil showed rapid O 2 depletion followed by N 2 O accumulation and a peak emission of N 2 O (2. 5 - 3. 0 mmol N 2 O m- 2 d- 1). Assuming that the observed emission of N 2 O from these wetland soils is generally representative to the Pantanal, we suggest that this undisturbed tropical wetland potentially contributes ~ 1. 7 % to the global N 2 O emission budget, a significant single source of N 2 O...|$|E

BremerTurfgrass covers 1. 9 % of the nation’s {{surface area}} {{and is the}} largest {{irrigated}} crop in the USA. Developed urbanized land is projected to double by 2025, which will increase turf’s environmental impact. Studies were conducted to evaluate environmental impacts by characterizing nitrogen, carbon, and water fluxes in turfgrass ecosystems. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N[subscript] 2 O), a major greenhouse gas and <b>ozone</b> <b>depleter</b> were measured from bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L. Pers. x C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy) (bermuda), perennial ryegrass, (Lolium perenne L.) (rye), and zoysiagrass, (Zoysia japonica Steud.) (zoysia) under regional N management. In a separate study, N 2 O fluxes were measured from bermuda fertilized with controlled-release N fertilizers including polymer-coated and organic-N, and quick release urea. Emissions of N 2 O were measured using static surface chambers and gas chromatography. Zoysia, with less N requirements, had lower emissions than bermuda. Cumulative N[subscript] 2 O emissions were similar among N types. To measure water and carbon fluxes, a portable non-steady state chamber was designed and tested. The chamber had minimal affects to the canopy during field measurements: leak values averaged < 1. 5 micromol CO[subscript] 2 m[superscript]- 2 s[superscript]- 1; average chamber pressure was 0. 09 Pa ± 0. 01 Pa; temperature rise inside the chamber averaged 0. 74 C; and the chamber had 90 % photosynthetically active radiation transmittance. Using the chamber, differences were detected in net photosynthesis (Pnet), gross photosynthesis (Pg), evapotranspiration (ET), canopy stomatal conductance (gc), and water use efficiency (WUE) in well-watered tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) (KBG), zoysia, and bermuda. Irrigation requirements, visual quality ratings, and genetic rooting potential of 28 KBG cultivars and 2 Texas bluegrass hybrids (P. pratensis x P. arachnifera Torr.) were quantified in greenhouse and rainout facility studies. Average water applied ranged from 23. 4 to 40. 0 cm among cultivars. Bedazzled, Preakness, and Bartitia required less water and had higher average quality than other cultivars. Compact America and Mid-Atlantic phenotypes exhibited greatest potential for success in integrating reduced water inputs with maintenance of acceptable visual quality. Results indicated that turfgrass management could mitigate N[subscript] 2 O emissions and conserve water while maintaining healthy turfgrass, and the new chamber will enhance turfgrass studies by providing rapid measurements of photosynthesis...|$|E
