40|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>seed</b> {{production}} {{has an important}} role in human nutrition and industry. Success in oil plant cultivation is related to seed production with high viability and rapid germination, because these seeds rapidly loose their viability by fats oxidation. Thus, in this work we studied the effects of ascorbic acid, pyridoxine and hydrogen peroxide solutions on germination quantitative traits, catalase activity, protein and malondialdehyde content of three old <b>oil</b> <b>seeds</b> (sunflower, <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> and safflower). The results showed that ascorbic acid and pyridoxine stimulated significantly the sunflower and <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> germination. These vitamins, however, didn't have any effect on safflower germination. Hydrogen peroxide strongly increased safflower germination. Ascorbic acid and pyridoxine decreased catalase activity in sunflower and <b>rape</b> <b>seed,</b> whereas hydrogen peroxide increased it. Ascorbic acid and pyridoxine prevented protein degradation and lipid peroxidation in germinated seeds. Consequently, we understand that ascorbic acid and pyridoxine can increase sunflower and <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> germination and stimulate rate of growth. Also safflower germination increased due to germination inhibitor oxidation by hydrogen peroxide. In conclusion, this report shows that <b>oil</b> <b>seeds</b> treated with ascorbic acid, pyridoxine and hydrogen peroxide remarkably increase the capacity of germination. We suggest that treatments with such substances can improve the old <b>oil</b> <b>seed</b> germination during storage...|$|R

Downy mildew is a common disease of brassicas and closely related cruciferous crops. This thesis surveys downy mildew caused by Hyaloperonospora (Peronospora) spp. with focus on the rocket salad species. 	The susceptibility experiment was carried out to research the host specificity of plant parasitic Oomycetes Hyaloperonospora (Peronospora) spp. on rocket salad (wild rocket, Diplotaxis tenuifolia and cultivated rocket salad, Eruca sativa) and other chosen crops from the Brassicaceae family (broccoli, cauliflower, swede, <b>oil</b> <b>seeds</b> <b>rape)</b> at the seedlings stage. Seedlings were inoculated with different isolates (frozen plant material from 2008, diseased brassicas and closely related cruciferous crops from the fields in Norway and diseased cruciferous weeds grown close to the fields with the Brassicaceae family crops). The experiment {{has shown that the}} pathogen from a certain host plant species was more aggressive on plants of the same species. The pathogen from the host plant D. tenuifolia was significantly more aggressive on seedlings of D. tenuifolia. The pathogen from the host plant broccoli was more aggressive on broccoli seedlings, but was also capable to infect cauliflower, swede and oilseed rape. The pathogen from host plant swede was more aggressive on seedlings of swede, but disease was observed also on cauliflower and broccoli. 	The thesis also covers a survey of the survival of conidia in the air. The spores of Hyaloperonospora (Peronospora) spp. were exposed to solar radiation for different time intervals. Afterwards, the viability of these spores was evaluated. Results from the experiment indicate a certain decreasing trend in the viability of spores over the time of their exposure. 	The third experimental part surveys whether the overwintering structures of Hyaloperonospora (Peronospora) spp. in the soil can cause an infection on the seedlings of D. tenuifolia. The soil from the fields, where rocket salad was grown previous years, was sampled. An occurrence of the disease on the seedlings of D.  tenuifolia was observed.

It was tried to apply the Riedel’s type equation (Riedel, 1945 a, b) to the measured results to obtain relationship between the {{vapor pressure}} and the temperature. The results obtained could be summarized, as follows : 1) The vapor pressure increased with increasing temperature.

In the case of Sesami oil the curve had the constant value in a range from 280 ℃ to 300 ℃.

40|$|In the {{cultivation}} of rape, the <b>oil</b> content of <b>seed</b> must {{be regarded as a}} important factor as well as the seed yield. This studies aimed to research the basic materials in relation to cultivating technic and breeding for the increase of oil production, and were concerned with the ecological changes of the <b>oil</b> formation in <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> under various conditions during seed development. I. Relation of oil formation to the morphological development of seed under several condition (1) In autumn <b>seeded</b> <b>rape,</b> <b>oil</b> formation was accelerated especially in later half period during seed development, and continued untill 55 days after flowering when dry weight of seed reached maximum. Iodine value and refractive index of <b>oil</b> decreased as <b>seed</b> matured. (2) The flowering period continued for about a month in autumn <b>seeded</b> <b>rape,</b> and therefore, as flowering was later, the rate of development of pod, seed and embryo and of oil formation became more rapidly. But <b>oil</b> content of <b>seed</b> was lower in later flowering. It was confirmed that iodine value of <b>oil</b> decreased as <b>seed</b> matured. (3) In spring <b>seeded</b> <b>rape</b> at the high land, the rate of <b>seed</b> development and <b>oil</b> formation was extremly promoted because of high temperature even at the early stage of seed development. But the seed harvested had very low oil. Iodine value of oil, which was very low at the earliest stage of the oil formation, increased rapidly until the middle stage, and then decreased gradually. (4) It was clarified that <b>oil</b> formation in <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> was closely combined with the development of seed, especially of embryo or cotyledon in which oil was synthesized and accumulated. The difference in the change of iodine value between autumn and spring <b>seeded</b> <b>rapes</b> was discussed. It was suggested that percent constitution of each fatty acid during oil formation was both influenced by the environmental and hereditable factors. II. Influence of natural environmental conditions on the <b>oil</b> formation of <b>seed</b> (1) It was confirmed experimentally that high temperature during seed development decreased the yield and <b>oil</b> content of <b>seed.</b> (2) When 50 % of the natural sun light was shaded during <b>seed</b> development, <b>oil</b> content of <b>seed</b> decreased about 10 %. Shading from 30 to 15 days before maturation most profoundly effected on the oil content and yield of seed. (3) Excessive soil moisture decreased both the oil content and yield of seed. Under dry condition of soil, oil content was not lower than under moderate condition, but seed yield decreaced remarkably. (4) Year variation of <b>oil</b> content in <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> was evident in similar variety at similar station. Relationship between this variation and weather condition of each year was discussed. Relatively low temperature, much sunshine and moderate precipitation during seed development may be favourable both for the high yield and the high <b>oil</b> content of <b>seed.</b> III. Influence of cultivating conditions on the <b>oil</b> formation of <b>seed</b> (1) <b>Oil</b> content of <b>seed</b> was low on the area of high soil productivity, and was high on the area of low soil productivity. There {{was no significant difference in}} oil content between areas where soil productivity was shown to be uniform. It was considerable that available nitrogen was rich in such high productive soil. (2) With the increase of nitrogen application, seed yield increased and <b>oil</b> content of <b>seed</b> decreased. In this case, increased application of potassium fertilizer with nitrogen did not decreased the oil content. (3) The <b>oil</b> content of <b>seed</b> tended to behigher in direct sowing cultivation than in transplanting. Effect of delay in sowing time on the <b>oil</b> content of <b>seed</b> seemed to be variable owing to the weather conditions during growing season and the varieties. Early type may be preferable in oil content to the later type under various conditions. Density of sowing had a little effect on the <b>oil</b> content of <b>seed...</b>|$|R
