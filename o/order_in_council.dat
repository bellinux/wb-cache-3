5|$|The Special Reserve {{was to be}} {{organised}} by regulations issued {{under the}} Reserve Forces Act 1882, forming regiments and battalions either of existing regular corps or of newly created ones. The Crown was given the power to transfer, by <b>Order</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council,</b> existing battalions of the Militia to the Special Reserve, which were to be deemed lawfully formed battalions of special reservists as of that date. An <b>Order</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council</b> was accordingly made under this section on 9 April 1908, which transferred all units of the Militia, other than those which disbanded, into the Special Reserve.|$|E
5|$|Where a County Association {{had been}} formed, an <b>Order</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council</b> {{could be made}} {{providing}} for the transfer of specified Yeomanry and Volunteer units from that county, {{in whole or in}} part, into the Territorial Force. These units would be deemed to have been lawfully formed units of the Territorial Force as of the date of that Order. As of that date, every officer and man in the unit would be deemed {{to be a member of}} the Territorial Force; however, this was not to affect their terms of service. An <b>Order</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council</b> was made under this section on 19 March 1908, which transferred all existing units of the Yeomanry and Volunteers, with a small number of exceptions.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, <b>Orders</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council</b> {{are used}} {{as a way for}} the Prime Minister to make {{political}} appointments, but they {{can also be used to}} issue simple laws as a sort of decree. Often in times of emergency, a government may issue legislation directly through <b>Orders</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council,</b> forgoing the usual parliamentary procedure though most Orders of this sort are eventually formalized according to the traditional lawmaking process, if they are not revoked at the end of the emergency. However, in the UK, this power was later superseded by a statutory power to make such <b>Orders</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council</b> under the Civil Contingencies Act.|$|R

5|$|On 17 July 1917, {{to appease}} British {{nationalist}} feelings, King George issued an <b>Order</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council</b> {{that changed the}} name of the British Royal Family to the House of Windsor. He specifically adopted Windsor as the surname for all descendants of Queen Victoria then living in Britain, excluding women who married into other families and their descendants. He and his relatives who were British subjects relinquished the use of all German titles and styles, and adopted English surnames. George compensated several of his male relatives by creating them British peers. Thus, his cousin, Prince Louis of Battenberg, became the Marquess of Milford Haven, while his brother-in-law, the Duke of Teck, became the Marquess of Cambridge. Others, such as Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein and Princess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, simply stopped using their territorial designations. The system for titling {{members of the royal family}} was also simplified. Relatives of the British royal family who fought on the German side were simply cut off; their British peerages were suspended by a 1919 <b>Order</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council</b> under the provisions of the Titles Deprivation Act 1917.|$|E

Just before the marriage, Albert was naturalised by Act of Parliament, and granted the style of Royal Highness by an <b>Order</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council.</b>|$|E

5|$|It was {{originally}} envisaged {{that the first}} elections would be held on 1 November 1835, with the reformed town councils holding their first meetings on 9 November following. However, the process of dividing the boroughs into wards and preparing the burgess roll or electoral register was a lengthy one, and an <b>Order</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council</b> was made delaying the first elections to 26 December, with the new boroughs coming into formal existence on 1 January 1836.|$|E
