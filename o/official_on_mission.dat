40|$|Although {{hampered}} by many limitations in source material, scholars have amassed many details concerning the ancient Egyptian taxation system from all periods and {{have begun to}} understand how the system may have worked. The best documentation for taxation comes from the New Kingdom, when the combined evidence of government records and administrative texts leads to the conclusion that Egypt enjoyed a “mixed economy. ” The economic system fostered a complex system of economic interdependency wherein market forces played a complementary role: thus it was a “mixed” rather than a redistributive economy. Temples {{played a major role in}} the collection and redistribution of tax revenues. Especially important was the grain tax, which is well documented from many perspectives and was largely derived from the cultivation of lands on temple domains. Taxes were also paid to the Royal Treasury in livestock and other commodities. Taxation included a labor component in the form of the conscription of workers obliged to toil periodically tilling fields, laboring on construction projects, digging irrigation canals, and obtaining raw materials abroad. Tax revenues were used to finance royal building projects, maintain royal residences, carry on work in the quarries, supervise border security, wage war, support <b>officials</b> <b>on</b> <b>missions,</b> finance external trade, and safeguard trade routes. By the end of the Third Intermediate Period, the effects of the monetization of the economy gradually began to be felt. During this transformation, taxes in kind were replaced by taxes in coin...|$|R

Networks are not specific for communities in the 2000 ’s {{or for that matter}} human organisations, but the ability to build networks and introduce more actors to the organisation have become easier with today’s communication technology.  The study is about the Norrköping Municipality membership in the transnational network Sweden Emilia Romagna Network (SERN). It gives an insight into how networking and cooperation can be seen by politicians and <b>officials,</b> based <b>on</b> <b>mission</b> statements and the reason why a municipality choose to participate in transnational networks.

It is a qualitative study which involves interviews with officials and politicians from the Municipality of Norrköping and textual material from SERN’s strategy documents and policies. The empirical material has been analyzed from the theoretical and methodological traditions Actor-Network Theory and Discourse Theory. The study has shown that the cooperation have given an opportunity to establish contacts with other municipalities and organisations on a regional, national and international level, where members of the network can form European projects together. At the same time, emphasizes the importance of discussing each other’s work and approaches in the design of the network process. The network processes, the dimensions of cooperation and the motivations for cooperation are discussed in the analysis. ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1370s, the coastal people in China were {{forbidden}} to cross the oceans, other than <b>on</b> <b>official</b> <b>missions.</b> Fujian military officials, who had privately sent people across the seas to engage in trade, were punished not long thereafter. The prohibition was reinstated in 1381 and 1384, and an imperial command [...] "strictly prohibiting people from having contact with foreigners" [...] was promulgated in 1390. The frequency of these prohibitions suggests {{that they were not}} very effective, and the reason given for the imperial command was that [...] "at this time in Guangdong/Guangxi, Zhejiang and Fujian, there were foolish people who did not know of these prohibitions, and frequently engaged in private trade with foreigners". The prohibition on going abroad to trade privately was reiterated in 1397. Whether these prohibitions actually affected maritime trade between southern China and Southeast Asia is not immediately apparent from the Ming texts, and perhaps through further archaeological research, {{it will be possible to}} piece together the ebbs and flows in maritime trade between China and Southeast Asia during this period.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} the Draft Convention on the Criminal Accountability of UN <b>Officials</b> and Experts <b>on</b> <b>Mission</b> as {{drafted by the}} Group of Legal Experts {{at the end of}} 2006. The Draft Convention arose out of a mandate given by the UN Secretary-General to the Group of Legal Experts. The mandate was to determine how to ensure accountability of UN staff and experts <b>on</b> <b>mission</b> with respect to criminal acts committed in peacekeeping operations. The need for examination of such issues arose from the incidences of sexual abuse and exploitation that have been committed by peacekeeping personnel in recent years. Ultimately, ensuring accountability for criminal misconduct by peacekeepers is a question of jurisdiction. The Group's main recommendation is that jurisdictional priority be given to the host state, and this is echoed in the text of the Draft Convention. The Group states the aim of the convention to be the creation of "conditions which make it easier for any applicable immunity to be waived, without prejudice to the rights of the alleged offender". The draft convention "sets out obligations on the part of States parties to take measures to investigate, arrest, prosecute and extradite offenders and to render mutual legal assistance [and] {{to protect the rights of}} victims". Taking into account that this is only a first draft of a potential convention, there are many questions that arise, some of which will be addressed by this paper. Such questions include: What would a convention achieve that other UN rules and regulations would not? What are the strengths and the limitations of the Draft Convention? How can the effectiveness of the Draft Convention in preventing and prosecuting criminal conduct by peacekeepers, in particular sexual abuse and exploitation, be maximised? Will a convention solve the current problem of impunity for peacekeeping criminal misconduct?No Full Tex...|$|R

The invaders were so impressed by Rassin's wise rule that they chose to withdraw and leave Mafonda in peace. The British administration in Freetown was equally impressed with Alimamy Rassin's rule and offered him a large annual stipend to continue with his efforts to establish peace among the interior rulers. But Rassin rejected the offer, arguing that it was unethical to accept payment {{for the promotion of}} peace. He ruled wisely for the benefit of his people and not for political favours from the British. Alimamy Rassin died in 1890, six years before the chiefs lost their independence to British rule.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{determine}} the most effective jurisdiction for criminal accountability for UN peacekeeping personnel who engage in sexual exploitation and abuse of women, and other conduct amounting to violence against women. As criminalisation is sought as the appropriate method of prevention and punishment of such conduct, it is first examined why criminalisation is necessary. The impact of sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) on women in the territories in which peace operations are located is detailed as harms {{in the form of}} violations of the rights of these women. Alternatives to criminal sanctions are then considered, in particular the actions of the UN towards prevention and prohibition of SEA. While such regulations are necessary, they are ultimately inadequate in preventing and punishing SEA. Included is an assessment of the Draft Convention on Criminal Accountability of UN <b>Officials</b> and Experts <b>on</b> <b>Mission,</b> the adoption of which would support criminalisation. However, the UN itself is unable to exercise criminal jurisdiction, and thus it is essential to examine which jurisdictions would be most effective in undertaking criminal prosecution of peacekeeping personnel. The choice between national jurisdictions and international criminal justice is debated. Which jurisdiction offers a more effectual forum for ensuring accountability? What potential impediments exist and how can such hindrances can be overcome? This thesis argues that gender-based crimes by UN peacekeepers should be criminalised, and that, while the International Criminal Court should not be discounted as a potential forum for prosecuting perpetrators, domestic prosecutions are far more likely and far more effective...|$|R
