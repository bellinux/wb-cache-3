40|$|Sugarcane Mosaic Virus (SCMV) causes one of {{the most}} severe virus {{diseases}} in maize worldwide, resulting in reduced grain and forage yield in susceptible cultivars. In this study, two association panels consisting of 94 inbred lines each, from China and the U. S., were characterized for resistance to two isolates: SCMV-Seehausen and SCMV-BJ. The population structure of both association panels was analyzed using 3072 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The Chinese and the U. <b>S.</b> <b>panel</b> were both subdivided into two sub-populations, the latter comprised of Stiff Stalk Synthetic (SS) lines and Non Stiff Stalk Synthetic (NSS). The relative kinships were calculated using informative 2947 SNPs with minor allele frequency ≥ 5 % and missing data ≤ 20 % for the Chinese panel and 2841 SNPs with the same characteristics were used for the U. <b>S.</b> <b>panel.</b> The Scmv 1 region was genotyped using 7 single sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers, and 12 SSR markers were used for the Scmv 2 region in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>panel,</b> while 5 of them were used for the Chinese panel. For all traits, a MLM (Mix Linear Model) controlling both population structure and relative kinship (Q + K) was used for association analysis. Three markers Trx- 1, STS- 11, and STS- 12 located in the Scmv 1 region were strongly associated (P = 0. 001) with SCMV resistance, and explained more than 16. 0 %, 10. 6 %, and 19. 7 % of phenotypic variation, respectively. 207 FG 003 located in the Scmv 2 region was significantly associated (P = 0. 001) with SCMV resistance, and explained around 18. 5 % of phenotypic variation...|$|R

40|$|Many {{branches}} of engineering, mathematics, and sciences, {{have relied on}} benchmark problems as a standard means to compare different solution techniques. Since 1996, the ASCE Structural Control and Monitoring Committee and Task Group on Benchmark Problems, the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Panel</b> on structural control, and IASCM have developed a series of benchmark control problems that offer a set of carefully modeled real-world structures in which different control strategies can be implemented, evaluated, and compared using {{a common set of}} performance indices. First-, second- and third-generation benchmark problems focusing on the response control of seismic and wind-excited buildings, and seismically excited long-span cable-stayed bridges have been developed and evaluated. The U. <b>S.</b> <b>Panel</b> on structural control and monitoring (currently chaired by Professor Satish Nagarajaiah, Rice University, Houston, TX), IASCM, and the ASCE structural control and monitoring committee have developed a new benchmark study to compare control strategies designed for a base-isolated building subjected to strong near-fault pulse-like ground motions.

40|$|Previous U. <b>S.</b> <b>panel</b> {{estimates}} of minimum wage effects {{have been criticized}} {{on the grounds that}} their identification rests on comparisons of ‘‘low-wage’’ and ‘‘high-wage’’ workers. Using Canadian panel data for 1988 – 90, I compare estimates based on the traditional U. S. methodology with those based on samples of ‘‘low-wage’’ workers exclusively. The results would appear to vindicate the critics: The minimum wage effect from the latter approach is virtually zero. Yet, estimates from different subgroups of low-wage workers indicate that there is a significant disemployment effect for those with longer low-wage employment histories. This highlights the heterogeneity within low-wage workers and the importance of carefully defining the target group not solely based on workers’ wages. ...|$|R

Utilizing longitudinal {{data from the}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>Panel</b> Study for Income Dynamics, we investigate {{the reasons for the}} low rate of entrepreneurship from the public sector.

We also uncover tenure and context effects, which decrease and increase the hazard rate of entrepreneurial exit, respectively.
