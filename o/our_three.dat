500|$|On 14 February, Benfica {{began their}} 2006–07 UEFA Cup {{campaign}} {{with a home}} game against Dinamo București. They struggled to convert goal chances, having hit the goalposts twice in the second half. Miccoli finally broke Dinamo's defence with a 90th-minute goal. Four days later, the Italian led Benfica to a win in Choupana against Nacional, allowing Benfica to overtake Sporting and reach {{second place in the}} Primeira Liga, four points behind Porto. On 22 February, Benfica visited the Stadionul Dinamo for the second leg with Dinamo, beating them 2–1 to reach to the round of 16. Benfica played their last match of the month against Paços de Ferreira on 25 February. They won the match by 3–1 against the Paços de Ferreira-based side due to double from Simão and another from Nuno Gomes. The win opened a three-point gap over Sporting, but Santos said, [...] "That is not what matters. It is <b>our</b> <b>three</b> points. We have 4 points deficit from Porto and we will try to get closer." ...|$|E
500|$|The Coat of {{arms of the}} Royal Society is [...] "in a dexter {{corner of}} a shield argent <b>our</b> <b>three</b> Lions of England, and for crest a helm adorned with a crown studded with florets, surmounted by an eagle of proper colour holding in one foot a shield charged with our lions: {{supporters}} two white hounds gorged with crowns", with the motto of [...] "nullius in verba". John Evelyn, interested in the early structure of the society, had sketched out at least six possible designs, but in August 1662 Charles II told the society that it was allowed to use the arms of England {{as part of its}} coat and the society [...] "now resolv'd that the armes of the Society should be, a field Argent, with a canton of the armes of England; the supporters two talbots Argent; Crest, an eagle Or holding a shield with the like armes of England, viz. 3 lions. The words Nullius in verba". This was approved by Charles, who asked Garter King of Arms to create a diploma for it, and when the second charter was signed on 22 April 1663 the arms were granted to the president, council and fellows of the society along with their successors.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the lyrics}} were {{composed}} by Batmanglij and Koenig in Batmanglij's apartment (a former factory building in Brooklyn) and at a rented cottage on Martha's Vineyard. The lyrics explore more mature, world-weary themes such as growing old and disillusionment with American foreign policy. The album eschewed the theme of privileged youth from their first two albums in favor of characters with adult responsibilities and reflections on the passage of time. Faith and mortality are recurring themes on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", [...] "Worship You", and [...] "Everlasting Arms". Koenig likened their first three albums to Brideshead Revisited: [...] "The naïve joyous school days in the beginning. Then {{the expansion of the}} world, travel, seeing other places, learning {{a little bit more about}} how people live. And then the end is a little bit of growing up, starting to think more seriously about your life and your faith. If people could look at <b>our</b> <b>three</b> albums as a bildungsroman, I’d be O.K. with that." [...] According to Brice Ezell from PopMatters, Modern Vampires of the City is [...] "very much an indie rock record" [...] because of Koenig's voice and diction, which reveals [...] "the youth that he and his bandmates so often strive to shrug off." [...] Ezell asserts that, on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", the [...] "reckless abandon" [...] expressed by the lyrics reveals [...] "the group's grasp on the genuine rebellion that indie rock ought to strive for." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{gain some}} {{geometric}} insights and clarification, {{we will start}} {{with a population of}} three values, x1, x2, x3. This defines a point P = (x1, x2, x3) in R3.

If <b>our</b> <b>three</b> given values were all equal, then the standard deviation would be zero and P would lie on L.

The character of Sophia was thought by the creators to enhance the idea that three retirement-aged women could be young. Disney's Michael Eisner explains, [...] "Estelle Getty made <b>our</b> <b>three</b> women into girls. And that was, to me, what made it seem like {{it could be a}} contemporary, young show." [...] As surprising as it may sound, Estelle Getty continuously battled her stage fright. During an interview in 1988, Getty commented on her phobia and expressed how working with major stars, such as Arthur and White, made her even more nervous. At times, she even froze on camera while filming.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{scholars}} have accused Eliade of [...] "essentialism", {{a type of}} over-generalization in which one incorrectly attributes a common [...] "essence" [...] to a whole group—in this case, all [...] "religious" [...] or [...] "traditional" [...] societies. Furthermore, some see a connection between Eliade's essentialism with regard to religion and fascist essentialism with regard to races and nations. To Ellwood, this connection [...] "seems rather tortured, in the end amounting {{to little more than}} an ad hominem argument which attempts to tar Eliade's entire [...] work with the ill-repute all decent people feel for storm troopers and the Iron Guard". However, Ellwood admits that common tendencies in [...] "mythological thinking" [...] may have caused Eliade, as well as Jung and Campbell, to view certain groups in an [...] "essentialist" [...] way, and that this may explain their purported antisemitism: [...] "A tendency to think in generic terms of peoples, races, religions, or parties, which as we shall see is undoubtedly the profoundest flaw in mythological thinking, including that of such modern mythologists as <b>our</b> <b>three,</b> can connect with nascent anti-Semitism, or the connection can be the other way." ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{the help}} of the {{underground}} buzz that he garnered over the years, Saigon signed a record deal with Atlantic Records in 2004. Despite the co-sign from producer Just Blaze and collaborations with several acclaimed rap artists such as Jay-Z, Kanye West and Kool G Rap, Saigon's record label repeatedly balked at setting a release date for his debut album. Saigon revealed that he realized as early as two months into his deal with Atlantic Records that there were problems. He later recalled how his early excitement at signing to the same label that [...] "had so much history with black music, like Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles" [...] was quickly dampened when they suggested he record a radio-friendly song with the Miami-based R quartet, Pretty Ricky. He also recalled a meeting with an Atlantic executive who told him [...] "We need <b>our</b> <b>three</b> singles, then you can bust your artistic nut {{on the rest of the}} album." [...] Saigon however, wasn’t willing to compromise with this request, and only one year after signing with Atlantic, he hired a lawyer to work out a release from his label. He explained [...] "They signed me knowing the kind of music I was making, but then they try and change the direction".|$|E
