5000|$|Some critics {{thought that}} through Satya Varma was glorifying crime, {{violence}} and the underworld, causing him to add a cautionary message to the end credits of the film: This film is an attempt on my part {{to reach out to}} all those people who took to violence as a means for their living. At the end of it, even if one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> looks into himself before he takes out his gun the next time, and understands that the pain he inflicts on others is exactly the same as he would suffer himself, I would consider this effort worthwhile.My tears for Satya are as much as they are for the people whom he killed.|$|E

[...] He also noted that he enjoyed working with non-scholarship athletes who were playing for the love of the game: [...] "It's a blast. It's {{a lot of fun to}} deal with those kind of people. They want to have fun, and they're gonna work hard, but every one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> is <b>out</b> <b>there</b> because they want to be. I look forward to going to practice. They're wide-eyed.

5000|$|For {{each chapter}} in The Raw Shark Texts there is, or will be, an un-chapter, a negative. If you look {{carefully}} at the novel {{you might be able}} to figure out why these un-chapters are called negatives.Not all the negatives are as long as a full novel chapter - some are only a page, some are only a couple of lines. Some are much longer than any chapters in the novel. About a quarter <b>of</b> <b>them</b> are <b>out</b> <b>there</b> so far. (Itâ€™s an ongoing project set to run for a while yet) Not all of the negatives are online, some are, but they're hiding. Some are <b>out</b> <b>there</b> in the real world, waiting to be found. Anyone with the Raw Shark UK special edition will already have Negative 6/36 and anyone with a Canadian edition will have Negative 36/36 (and also a good idea of what some of the other negatives are).The negatives are not deleted scenes, they are very much a part of the novel but they are all splintered from it in some way.|$|R

The girls said the video was probably taken by a bystander and as they always respond to harassers in the same manner, there were probably more videos <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The cost {{of tuition}} {{increases}} yearly at the University of Maryland, {{as it has}} in the majority of State-funded Universities. However, according to Pease, a major matter of concern isn't only the rising cost of tuition, but the increasingly prohibitive hidden costs of the textbooks and course materials for class. Often newer editions of textbooks that are not fundamentally different from past editions are pressed upon the faculty for use in the next teaching period. In an article to the Washington Post newspaper, Pease has commented that, [...] "Once they've published a textbook and there's a zillion <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> -- that's it for their profit until they {{can come up with a}} new edition or some sort of technique to sell more books." [...] The Post continues, [...] "One of the techniques Pease and others cite is the 'bundling' of books with other materials, such as study guides, Web site access, test questions, CD-ROMs and more. These add-ons are helping to drive up the cost of books.|$|E
5000|$|Robert Greenwald, who had {{directed}} the controversial documentary Outfoxed that criticized O'Reilly and the Fox News Channel, {{put together an}} event of homeless veterans criticizing O'Reilly for calling John Edwards dishonest when Edwards asserted that there were about 200,000 homeless veterans.

So if you know where there is a veteran sleeping under a bridge, you call me immediately, and we will make sure that man does not do it." [...] After government statistics supported Edwards, O'Reilly then said that there was no linkage between the economy and homeless veterans and claims that Veterans Affairs has up to 150,000 beds ready for them every night. O'Reilly felt Greenwald's event was a [...] "contrived" [...] situation after O'Reilly's producers had interviewed some of the homeless veterans whom were protesting and found out that some did not actually hear O'Reilly's comments.

60|$|Presently {{they reached}} a room from which a {{circular}} tunnel led away from the tower, and into this the creature conducted her. The tunnel was some seven feet in diameter and flattened on the bottom to form a walk. For a hundred feet from the tower it was lined with the same tile-like material of the light well and amply illuminated by reflected light from that source. Beyond it was faced with stone of various shapes and sizes, neatly cut and fitted together--a very fine mosaic without a pattern. There were branches, too, and other tunnels which crossed this, and occasionally openings not {{more than a foot}} in diameter; these latter being usually close to the floor. Above each of these smaller openings was painted a different device, while upon the walls of the larger tunnels at all intersections and points of convergence hieroglyphics appeared. These the girl could not read though she guessed that they were the names of the tunnels, or notices indicating the points to which they led. She tried to study some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>out,</b> but <b>there</b> was not a character that was familiar to her, which seemed strange, since, while the written languages of the various nations of Barsoom differ, it still is true that they have many characters and words in common.|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked how}} he became acquainted with Faroese tunes, Nielsen explained: [...] "They have {{interested}} me for many years. I knew Hjalmar Thuren, who collected many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> getting people to sing them for him, and I have studied Dr. GrÃ¼ner-Nielsen's large collection. Many of the songs are very beautiful, {{and they have a}} wealth of songs on the Faroe Islands. They are often closely related to the Danish ones, but with small variations - just as there are variants of the old texts that Svend Grundtvig collected. But some of the melodies also have their own tone. Itâ€™s borne up by a certain quiet seriousness. It reminds me of people who go around quietly and yet have a strong effect on others because behind the calm you sense solid substance. You canâ€™t call Faroese song melancholy - rather, it gives the impression of a mind that is resigned to the will of Fate. It is these melodies that I have had as material... they have set the tone for my overture. I did not create so much of it myself through any spiritual experience, and yet the work has filled me with pleasure. I have tried to offer some of the same spirit that the painter or sculptor creates when he places his abilities at the service of applied art." ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{the tour}} first started, peopleâ€”especially womenâ€”thronged {{to see it}} wearing clothes {{inspired}} by Madonna. Debbi Voller, author of Madonna: The Style Book, observed that [...] "Hundreds of thousands of young girls came to the concert dressed like her, with bleached and tousled hair, see-through tops, bras, fingerless gloves and crucifixes. Magazines and TV shows ran lookalike competitions." [...] This frenzy regarding Madonna {{gave rise to a}} new term called Madonna wannabeâ€”a word that was ultimately officially recognized by the Webster's Dictionary in May 1991. Madonna was mystified as to why all the women would want to copy her look. She commented,"I never set out to be a role model. I am a strong woman, a successful woman, and I don't conform to a stereotype. For so long women have been told that there are certain ways they mustn't look if they want to get ahead in life. And there I was dressing in a forbidden way and yet obviously in charge of my life. It was then I realized why were all <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> in their seats, dressing like me."While the tour was going on, the American lingerie industry reported that their turnover was suddenly up by 40 percent and that Madonna's image was responsible for this underwear revival. Sam Gower from Rolling Stone commented, [...] "In the sixties, women burned their bras, now they wear five at a time, and bare their belly buttons. Madonna has done for the corset and crucifix what punk did for the safety pin. Macy's New York department store was flooded with buyers, who bought the tour merchandise like the crucifix earrings and fingerless gloves." [...] The demand was so huge that Macy's had to refill the merchandise time again. Madonna's subversive antics on the tour provoked fiery and antics among the press. Rolling Stone said: [...] "Like Marilyn Monroe, Madonna is bent on epitomizing and championing a vision of female sexuality, and like Monroe she is often dismissed as an artist for doing so." [...] Suzanne Ferriss, author of On Fashion said that [...] "Virgin Tour exemplified Madonna's extended desire to treat boys as toys and her chastity belt coming off at her own whim and desire. Her dance numbers with men during the tour shows them as her underlings, accessories that she toys with and totally dominates." ...|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, on Earth, the {{original}} Valentin realizes that something strange is happening with his in-game character {{and decides to}} investigate further. He contacts Lena via ICQ and invites her over to discuss in-game events. However, he quickly realizes that someone is trying to prevent their meeting from occurring. Lena arrives to his apartment, where she confirms his suspicions that everything they have been told at the agency is true â€” there really are copies <b>of</b> <b>them</b> somewhere <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> flying spaceships and fighting. Valentin receives a call on a phone which {{he turned off the}} day before, where an unknown person threatens him to drop his investigation and just play the game. The unknown person {{turns out to be a}} sniper on a neighboring roof. Valentin and Lena barely manage to escape in her car. They drive to Oleg, an acquaintance of Valentin, who is intrigued by their story. At Oleg's apartment, Valentin decides that they must contact their doubles and get them to return to Earth in their ships to threaten the agency. He takes a screenshot of the game's 2D star map and sends it to a local astronomer. Surprisingly, the astronomer fairly quickly manages to determine the location of the Sun on the game's map. Lena logs into the game as her other character (whose ship is operated by a bot in space).|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, Sher {{played the}} role of the {{composer}} Gustav Mahler in Ronald Harwoodâ€™s play Mahlers Conversion, about Mahlerâ€™s decision to renounce his Jewish faith prior to his appointment as conductor and artistic director of the Vienna State Opera House in 1897. Speaking about the role to The Guardians Rupert Smith, Sher revealed: [...] "When I came to England in 1968, at 19, I looked around me and I didnt see any Jewish leading men in the classical theatre, so I thought it best to conceal my Jewishness. Also, I quickly became conscious of apartheid when I arrived here, and I didnt want to be known as a white South African. I was brought up in a very apolitical family. We were happy to enjoy the benefits of apartheid without questioning the system behind it. Reading about apartheid when I came to England was a terrible shock. So I lost the accent almost immediately, and if anyone asked me where I was from I would lie. If they asked where I went to school, Id say Hampstead, which got me into all sorts of trouble because of course everyone else went to school in Hampstead and they wanted to know which one. Then there was my sexuality. The theatre was full of gay people, but none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were <b>out,</b> and <b>there</b> was that ugly story about Gielgud being arrested for cottaging, so I thought Id better hide that as well. Each of these things went into the closet until my entire identity was in the closet. Thats why this play appealed to me so much: its about an artist changing his identity in order to get what he wants." ...|$|R
