5|$|Brezhnev {{consolidated}} his {{own position}} over the Government Apparatus by strengthening Podgorny's position as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, literally head of state, {{by giving the}} office some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>functions</b> of the Premier. The 1977 Soviet Constitution strengthened Podgorny's control of the Council of Ministers, by giving the post of head of state some executive powers. In fact, because of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, the Council of Ministers became subordinate to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. When Podgorny was replaced as head of state in 1977 by Brezhnev, Kosygin's role in day-to-day management of government activities was lessened drastically, through Brezhnev's new-found post. Rumours started circulating within the top circles, and on the streets, that Kosygin would retire due to bad health.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} {{if there was}} a {{formally}} established constitution dictating the laws, organization, and divisions of power in ancient Macedonia's government, although some tangential evidence suggests this. The king (basileus) served as the head of state and was assisted by his noble companions (hetairoi) and royal pages. The Macedonian kings had command over certain natural resources such as gold from mining and timber from logging. They were also expected to serve as high priests of the nation, using their wealth to sponsor various religious cults. The ancient Macedonian army arguably exercised its authority in matters such as the royal succession when there was no clear heir apparent. The army upheld some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>functions</b> of a popular assembly, a democratic institution which otherwise existed in only a handful of municipal governments within the Macedonian commonwealth, the Koinon of Macedonians. The Macedonian kings served as the commanders-in-chief of Macedonia's armed forces, while it was common for them to personally lead troops into battle.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have noted}} {{considerable}} political {{conflict in the}} burghs between the great merchants and craftsmen throughout the period. Merchants attempted to prevent lower crafts and gilds from infringing on their trade, monopolies and political power. Craftsmen attempted to emphasise their importance and to break into disputed areas of economic activity, setting prices and standards of workmanship. In the 15th century a series of statutes cemented the political position of the merchants, with limitations {{on the ability of}} residents to influence the composition of burgh councils and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>functions</b> of regulation taken on by the bailies. In rural society historians have noted a lack of evidence of widespread unrest similar to that evidenced the Jacquerie of 1358 in France and the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 in England, possibly because there was relatively little of the type of change in agriculture, like the enclosure of common land, that could create widespread resentment before the modern era. Instead a major factor was the willingness of tenants to support their betters in any conflict in which they were involved, for which landlords reciprocated with charity and support. Highland and border society acquired a reputation for lawless activity, particularly the feud. However, more recent interpretations have pointed to the feud as a means of preventing and speedily resolving disputes by forcing arbitration, compensation and resolution.|$|E
