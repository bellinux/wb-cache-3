40|$|<b>Heating</b> <b>appliances</b> used in {{buildings}} are designed according to building 2 ̆ 7 s heating load {{as a function}} of outdoor design air temperature. Usually this temperature is quite lower than the average external air temperature during the heating season. For most of the <b>heating</b> season, <b>heating</b> <b>appliances</b> do not operate at their nominal heating capacity. This requires boilers to operate at a lower thermal efficiency. Furthermore, on-off cycling of the pressure oil burner increases the amount of emissions of harmful substances into the flue gases. In many systems, a built-in burner is harmonized to the heating power of a boiler. The <b>heating</b> <b>appliance</b> 2 ̆ 7 s thermal efficiency appears to depend on burner cycle time and boiler heating load.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a newly-developed of an electromagnetic induction fluid <b>heating</b> <b>appliance</b> using a heatedflow-through metallic package {{incorporated into the}} nonmetallic vessel in the pipeline, which is composed of series-loaded resonant phase-shift PWM high-frequency inverter using IGBT modules and their optirum driver modules {{in addition to an}} auto-tuning PID controller for temperature regulation. This efficient inverter-fed type fluid <b>heating</b> <b>appliance</b> is more acceptable for high-quality heat energy transfer and delivery processing plants operated under a precise temperature control scheme as well as heat-energy storage and heat exchange processing plants because of clean, safty and high-efficient energy conversion, compactness in volumetric size, and ease to control. In particular, the series capacitor-compensated resonant PWM inverter with a power factor correction and active sinewave line current-shaping functions is introduced for induction-heated pipeline fluid healing. The original structure of electromagnetic induction-heated metallic package in the nonmetallic vessel or tank for high-efficient fluid heating is demonstrated from a practical point of view, in which specially-designed fluid-through induction-heating metallic package assembly with a huge heating surface to induce the eddy current is incorporated into the nonmetallic cylindrical vessel with a working coil connected to a high-frequency AC power supply. The inherent remarkable features of this power electronic appliance are schematically pointed out and confirmed. Its operating characteristics in the steady-state are illustrated and evaluated. The prospective applications of this new conceptional fluid <b>heating</b> <b>appliance</b> are mentioned herein...|$|R

40|$|Oil-fired <b>heating</b> <b>appliances</b> have {{traditionally}} used conventional chimney venting systems.
