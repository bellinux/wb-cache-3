Later models also offered a Dolby Prologic sound system can be connected to satellite radio, a six-CD changer, an iPod connector, a USB connector, or an auxiliary input jack. This sound system can be upgraded to a Bang & Olufsen stereo.|$|E

Max and Chumbucket find Scrotus driving around the Purgatory Flatlands an area {{far away from}} the Great White and use the Magnum Opus to crash the Land Mover, which is pushed {{to the edge of a}} cliff. Max wants to push the Mover off the cliff with the Magnum Opus but is opposed by Chumbucket, who considers himself the car's protector. Ignoring Chumbucket, he rams the Mover at full speed; Chumbucket dies, and the Land Mover and Magnum Opus are destroyed. Scrotus escapes with the Interceptor, Max's car at the start of the game, and challenges him. Max wins the battle, pulling the chainsaw blade out of Scrotus' head and killing him. The game ends with Max entering the Interceptor and placing a picture of his family <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dashboard</b> before he leaves for parts unknown.|$|E
25|$|In {{vehicles}} {{with a separate}} left and right green turn signal tell-tale <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dashboard,</b> both left and right indicators may flash to provide visual indication of the hazard flashers' operation. In {{vehicles with}} a single green turn signal tell-tale <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dashboard,</b> a separate red tell-tale must be provided for hazard flasher indication. Because the hazard flasher function operates the vehicle's left and right turn signals, a left or a right turn signal function may not be provided while the hazard flashers are operating, although the vehicle may activate the indicator {{and return to the}} hazard flashing phase once the indicator is deactivated.|$|E

25|$|For the 1983 model year, the Volkswagen {{received}} new {{front seats}} with adjustable headrests, already seen in cars such the Caribe and the Atlantic. A newly added item was the hand brake light <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dashboard.</b> 1983 also introduced a limited edition Aubergine Metallic paint scheme.

50|$|From 1911, Heuer {{manufactured}} timepieces to {{be mounted}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dashboards</b> of automobiles, aircraft, and boats. These clocks and timers included {{a variety of}} models, designed to address specific needs of racers and rallyists. In 1958, Heuer introduced {{a new line of}} dashboard timepieces, which included the Master Time (8-day clock), the Monte Carlo (12-hour stopwatch), the Super Autavia (full chronograph), Sebring (60-minute, split-second timer), and Auto-Rallye (60-minute stopwatch). Heuer continued to manufacture these <b>dashboard</b> timepieces into <b>the</b> 1980s, at which time they were discontinued.

25|$|Many U.S. states allow {{volunteer}} fire, EMS and Search and Rescue {{personnel to}} place emergency warning lights {{in their personal}} vehicles for use when responding to emergencies. The degree of lighting is mandated by law and also by local custom in most areas, and can vary from a single rotating light <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dashboard</b> or roof, to a setup much like modern police cruisers. Some states also allow volunteer use of sirens and air horns to request the right of way.|$|E
25|$|Another {{addition}} is the Media Nav system, already introduced {{earlier in}} the same year on the Lodgy, consisting of a 7-inch touchscreen display with multimedia functions and a navigation software included. Other new features are speed limiter, cruise control, rear parking sensors, and front and side airbags, as well as ABS and ESP, as standard. The interior has been significantly revised, with new chromed elements added, and the hood is now supported with a strut. A new Eco button, placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dashboard,</b> limits the engine revs to 4,000 rpm.|$|E
25|$|He {{continued}} {{experimenting with}} new modes of filming, using different directorial methods and techniques. A {{case in point}} is Ten, which was filmed in a moving automobile in which Kiarostami was not present. He gave suggestions to the actors about what to do, and a camera placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dashboard</b> filmed them while they drove around Tehran. The camera was allowed to roll, capturing the faces of the people involved during their daily routine, using a series of extreme-close shots. Ten was an experiment that used digital cameras to virtually eliminate the director. This new direction towards a digital micro-cinema is defined as a micro-budget filmmaking practice, allied with a digital production basis.|$|E

The display binnacle sits <b>on</b> top of <b>the</b> <b>dashboard</b> {{in front of}} the driver to aid production in left-hand drive markets, since it avoided the expense of producing two different dashboard mouldings for LHD and RHD versions. The air vent doubles as a passage for the steering-wheel column, and the [...] "podular" [...] display binnacle can be easily fitted <b>on</b> top of <b>the</b> <b>dashboard</b> <b>on</b> either <b>the</b> left or right-hand side of the car.

White and black colors were available for 2007 models and grabber orange or vista blue were available for 2008. A convertible was available in 2008 also.

25|$|Airtemp {{was more}} {{sophisticated}} and efficient than the complicated rival air conditioners of 1953. It recirculated, rather than merely cooled, the air inside the vehicle, {{and it was also}} the highest capacity unit available on an automobile. It was also simple to operate, with a single switch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dashboard</b> marked with low, medium, and high positions, which the driver selected as desired. The system was capable of cooling a Chrysler from 120 degrees to 85 degrees in about two minutes, and of completely eliminating humidity, dust, pollen and tobacco smoke at the same time. Since it relied on fresh air, and drew in sixty percent more of it than any contemporary system, Airtemp avoided the staleness associated with automotive air conditioning at the time. It was silent and unobtrusive. Instead of plastic tubes mounted on the package shelf as on GM and on other cars, small ducts directed cool air toward the ceiling of the car where it filtered down around the passengers instead of blowing directly on them, a feature that modern cars have lost.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} cabin includes {{seats for}} driver and one passenger. The interior is hardly upholstered; the earliest versions lacked of cover even <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ceiling.

The engine starter is operated by a separate button <b>on</b> <b>dashboard.</b> <b>The</b> heater nozzles are directed to the windscreen and legroom. The windscreen washing device works by squeezing a plastic bottle filled with washing fluid. The driver's seat is adjustable by rails.|$|R

25|$|Since 2009 {{there have}} been {{widespread}} concerns from Chinese consumers particularly among the online community, who expressed that Volkswagen has {{failed to respond to}} complaints about defects in its DSG-equipped vehicles. Typical issues associated with 6-speed DSG include abnormal noise and inability to change gear; while issues associated with 7-speed DSG include abnormal noise, excessive shift shock, abnormal increase in engine RPM, flashing gear indicator <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dashboard</b> as well as inability to shift to even-numbered gears. In March 2012 China’s quality watchdog the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) said that it had been in contact with Volkswagen (China) and urged the carmaker to probe the issues. In a survey held by Gasgoo.com (China) of 2,937 industry experts and insiders, 83% of respondents believed that the carmaker should consider a full vehicle recall. In March 2012 Volkswagen Group China admitted that there could be an issue in its seven-speed DSG gearboxes that may affect approximately 500,000 vehicles from its various subsidiaries in China. A software upgrade has since been offered for the affected vehicles in an attempt to repair the problem.|$|E
