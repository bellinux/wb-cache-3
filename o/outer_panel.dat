25|$|The board exhaustively {{investigated}} and analyzed {{the history of}} the manufacture and testing of the oxygen tank, and its installation and testing in the spacecraft up to the Apollo 13 launch, as documented in detailed records and logs. They visited and consulted with engineers at the contractor's sites and the Kennedy Space Center. Once a theory of the cause was developed, elements of it were tested, including on a test rig simulation in a vacuum chamber, with a damaged tank installed in the fuel cell bay. This test confirmed the theory when a similar explosion was created, which blew off the <b>outer</b> <b>panel</b> exactly as happened in the flight.|$|E
25|$|The Rhönbussard had its wing {{over the}} cockpit, {{limiting}} the pilot's view, {{but on the}} Rhönsperber it was lowered to mid fuselage. It is an entirely wood and fabric aircraft with a wing built around a single spar. Forward of the spar the wing is plywood covered around the leading edge, forming a torsion-resisting D-box. Aft of the spar, the covering is fabric. Each wing has two sections, a parallel-chord centre section and a double straight tapered <b>outer</b> <b>panel,</b> ending with semi-elliptical tips. The only dihedral, 5°, is on the centre section, forming the gull wing. Airbrakes are centrally placed on the upper centre section surface and fabric-covered ailerons fill the trailing edges of the outer panels.|$|E
25|$|The {{cooking chamber}} {{is similar to}} a Faraday cage to prevent the waves from coming out of the oven. Even though there is no {{continuous}} metal-to-metal contact around the rim of the door, choke connections on the door edges act like metal-to-metal contact, at the frequency of the microwaves, to prevent leakage. The oven door usually has a window for easy viewing, with a layer of conductive mesh some distance from the <b>outer</b> <b>panel</b> to maintain the shielding. Because the size of the perforations in the mesh is much less than the microwaves' wavelength (12.2 cm for the usual 2.45 GHz), microwave radiation cannot pass through the door, while visible light (with its much shorter wavelength) can.|$|E
50|$|Flying {{controls}} were essentially conventional with fin, rudder, all-flying tailplane, and ailerons on the <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> on the 1921 version. For the 1922 competition <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> of increased area and wing-warping control were introduced.|$|R
50|$|The cantilever, mid set, wooden {{wing of the}} OE-1 {{consisted}} of three parts: the 9 m span 90 cm chord rectangular planform centre section and two tapered <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> 4.5 m span and rounded wing-tips. Three position plain flaps were fitted to the trailing edges of the centre section with a chord of 24 cm and set positions of −0.5, +8 and +80 degrees. Ailerons occupied the entire trailing edges of the <b>outer</b> <b>panels.</b> A shallow gull form was due to reduced dihedral on the <b>outer</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|According to Dhanens, the sculptural depictions on the <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> are a [...] "brilliant success ... in imparting a {{sense of}} life to the {{supposed}} statues." [...] The wings continue van Eyck's innovation in placing two grisaille <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> wings of polyptychs; the earliest extant example being the Annunciation wings of the Ghent Altarpiece.|$|R
25|$|The {{panels are}} {{organised}} in two vertical registers, each with {{two sets of}} foldable wings with inner and <b>outer</b> <b>panel</b> paintings. The upper register of the inner panels contains form the central Deësis of Christ the King, Virgin Mary and John the Baptist. They are immediarly flanked, in the next panels by music playing angels, and, on the far outermost panels, the naked figures of Adam and Eve. The four lower-register panels are divided into two pairs; sculptural grisaille paintings of St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist, and on the two outer panels, donor portraits of Joost Vijdt and his wife Lysbette Borluut. The central panel of the lower register shows a gathering of saints, sinners, clergy and soldiers attendant at an adoration of the Lamb of God. There are several groupings of figures, overseen by the dove of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
2500|$|Flight 723 {{was cleared}} for a contact {{approach}} to runway 10. On final approach, while still {{miles west of}} the airport, the Convair descended too low, and at an altitude of , struck a set of three -tall radio masts arrayed east to west. [...] The right wing struck the center tower of the three, then the left wing struck the east tower. Seven feet of the <b>outer</b> <b>panel</b> of the right wing including the right aileron and control mechanism from the center hinge outboard together with 15 feet of the left outer wing panel and aileron separated from the aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|The second-worst fatal {{accident}} in Scottish Airlines' history occurred on 7 December 1957, {{when one of}} the firm's Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneer 1 planes (registration: G-AOEO) crashed 285 mi SSW of Tripoli, Libya. Following takeoff from Atshan airstrip for an expected three-and-a-half hour flight to Tripoli Idris Airport the aircraft failed to arrive at its destination. While the aircraft's wreckage was found 285 mi SSW of Tripoli, its left wing's <b>outer</b> <b>panel</b> was located 1,200 yards (yd) (1,100 metres (m)) from the main wreckage. The subsequent accident investigation established the failure of the forward tube of the [...] "V brace" [...] structure in the <b>outer</b> <b>panel</b> of the port wing due to fatigue as the probable cause. This failure caused the <b>outer</b> <b>panel</b> of the port wing to break away from the aircraft in flight. This in turn resulted in the aircraft becoming completely uncontrollable and diving vertically into the ground, killing all six occupants (two crew and four passengers).|$|E
50|$|The MB.141 was a {{low wing}} {{cantilever}} monoplane with a three part wing consisting of a rectangular plan centre section and trapezoidal <b>outer</b> <b>panels.</b> It was built around two spars and metal skinned; the leading edges were removable for maintenance purposes and the trailing edges carried high aspect ratio ailerons which filled {{about two-thirds of the}} <b>outer</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R

50|$|The low, {{cantilever}} {{wing of the}} M.112 was built in three parts, a tapered centre-section {{which was part of}} the fuselage and trapezoidal <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> with elliptical tips. Its aspect ratio of 9.5 was high for the time. The <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> carried mild dihedral and full-span, narrow-chord ailerons. The wings were completely wooden, with twin box spars and alder plywood skin.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the LeO H-27 was {{assisted}} by Lioré at Olivier's experience with the LeO H-180 and LeO H-240 flying boats, the first single-engined and the second with one push-pull pair. It was a high wing cantilever monoplane with an all-metal wing in two parts, each with a thick airfoil, rectangular plan centre section and a trapezoidal <b>outer</b> <b>panel</b> with a rounded tip. The <b>outer</b> <b>panel</b> tapered in thickness outwards and carried 11.80 m span ailerons which, like the rear control surfaces, were balanced. The wing was built around two duralumin spars joined into a central box to which the {{leading and trailing edges}} were attached; all were dural covered.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Dorfmann {{has been}} working on a radical idea: He {{believes}} they can build a new aircraft from the wreckage. The C-82 has twin booms extending rearwards from each engine and connected by the horizontal stabilizer. Dorfmann's plan is to attach the <b>outer</b> <b>panel</b> of the right wing to the left engine, left boom and left wing <b>outer</b> <b>panel,</b> discarding the center fuselage and both inner wing panels of the aircraft, having the passengers traveling on top of the wings. Harris and Moran believe he is either joking or delusional. The argument is complicated by a personality clash between Towns, who is a proud old traditionalist aviator, and Dorfmann, a young, equally-proud technician. Moran, a good-natured man suffering from alcoholism, struggles to keep the peace.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuel economy}} of the MKT is {{enhanced}} by many advanced weight saving developments. The liftgate of the MKT is manufactured from an inner panel of cast magnesium and an <b>outer</b> <b>panel</b> of stamped aluminum. The MKT also utilizes magnesium in the radiator support, rear seat back and cushion frame.|$|E
50|$|The Poite 3 had a three part, low, {{cantilever}} wing, {{built around}} twin spars {{and having a}} high aspect ratio (10.8). There was a rectangular centre-section which filled about {{one quarter of the}} span and almost triangular <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> which carried light dihedral and tapered in thickness. Its ailerons occupied about half the trailing edges of the <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> and increased in chord inboard.|$|R
50|$|The Régnier 12's wing was {{in three}} parts {{with a short}} span, {{rectangular}} plan centre section and almost triangular plan <b>outer</b> <b>panels,</b> strongly tapered with a tip angle of about 20°. The <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> had a dihedral of 4.5°. The wing was built around two wooden box spars; its ribs were also wooden and the skin was birch plywood. Long ailerons filled much of the outer panels' trailing edges.|$|R
50|$|The {{straight}} edged {{high wing}} of the Squale has a slightly tapered centre section of about 60% of the span and more strongly tapered <b>outer</b> <b>panels.</b> There is constant dihedral across the whole span. The ailerons are on the <b>outer</b> <b>panels,</b> with airbrakes on the trailing edges of the outer centre section. The wing is built around a single wooden spar, with wooden ribs and 2.3 mm (0.1 in) plywood skin.|$|R
5000|$|Hemming is a {{technology}} {{used in the}} automotive industry to join inner and outer closure [...] together (hoods, doors, tailgates, etc.). It {{is the process of}} bending/folding the flange of the <b>outer</b> <b>panel</b> over the inner one. The accuracy of the operation significantly affects the appearance of the car’s outer surfaces and is therefore a critical factor in the final quality of a finished vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{full-scale}} Arrow model differs {{slightly from}} those built in 1957-59. It was featured throughout the film but the wing structure had a pronounced <b>outer</b> <b>panel</b> dihedral that was [...] "corrected" [...] by CGI work. The wing design was seen on-screen [...] "only" [...] on a {{wind tunnel model}} crafted after an [...] "all-nighter" [...] by Chamberlin that was stable at Mach 2.5 and higher.|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} of his life except {{that he was the}} son of the painter Miguel Ximénez and {{assisted}} him and probably several other painters on a large altarpiece in the church of Tamarite de Litera near Huesca. A single <b>outer</b> <b>panel</b> by his hand from that altarpiece survives that was removed from the church before 1917, but the rest of the altarpiece was destroyed in the Spanish civil war.|$|E
50|$|Both {{the inner}} and outer {{sections}} of the wing were built around two wooden box spars and wooden ribs. The final ribs of the centre-section extended rearwards to the tail as the booms and the <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> were bolted to them. An open single cockpit for pilot and passenger in side-by-side seats was positioned between the spars. In plan the centre-section was rectangular, about 2.0 m in span, 3.0 m in chord (more than half the overall length of the aircraft) and was 660 mm thick. The <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> were braced to the lower centre-section outer edge on each side with two steel tube struts. In plan the <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> were strongly tapering trapezoids, carrying ailerons along the entire trailing edge.|$|R
50|$|The all wood Viking 2 {{was a close}} {{relative}} of the earlier Viking 1 but bigger, heavier and with a modified and repositioned wing. The latter retained the same planform, having a constant chord central section and tapered <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> with rounded tips. The <b>outer</b> <b>panels,</b> each about {{one third of the}} span, carried full width, variable droop ailerons. A pair of spoilers was fitted at mid-chord on the centre section. However, the wing was mid-mounted rather than shoulder mounted and had slight dihedral on the thickened central section. The upper surfaces of the <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> were without dihedral, forming overall a cantilever gull wing. The wing span was 10 ft 0 in (3.06 m) greater than that of the Viking 1.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: With the {{shutters}} closed, the two <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> reveal the donors kneeling {{in front of}} their patron saints ...|$|R
50|$|Its thick section, {{cantilever}} wing was in three parts, with a centre section between the engines and twin outer panels. The centre section was rectangular in {{plan and the}} outer panels were straight-tapered, square-tipped and constantly decreased in thickness outwards. The centre section had a steel tube structure which carried the engine mountings and the outer wings and was plywood-covered. Each <b>outer</b> <b>panel</b> was built around two spruce, ash and ply spars and had an aileron at its tip.|$|E
50|$|The Gypsy Hawk was an {{all-metal}} {{low wing}} monoplane, constructed throughout from light alloy angle spars and frames under a light alloy skin. The wings and tailplane had constant chord and square tips. There was a fuel tank in the <b>outer</b> <b>panel</b> of each wing. The all-moving tail {{was set at}} the extreme rear fuselage and had external mass balances and an anti-servo tab. The fin and rudder were further forward, swept and with a fillet to lead the fin into the strongly sloping upper fuselage.|$|E
50|$|Robot hemming is {{utilized}} for {{the manufacture of}} Low to medium production volumes.It uses a standard Industrial Robot integrated with a roller hemming head to provide a flexible solution to closure manufacture. The flange of the <b>outer</b> <b>panel</b> is bent over the inner panel in progressive steps {{by means of the}} roller hemming head. The process allows the advantage of using the robot controlled hemming head to hem several different components in a single cell. Minor changes and modifications to panel hemming conditions can also be accommodated allowing a quick and cost-effective reaction.|$|E
50|$|The Viking 1 was an all-wood aircraft, with {{a single}} spar {{cantilever}} shoulder wing which was fabric covered behind the spar. In plan, the wing had constant chord in the central section and tapered <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> with rounded tips. The <b>outer</b> <b>panels,</b> each about {{one third of the}} span, carried full width, variable droop ailerons. A pair of hinged plate spoilers was fitted at mid-chord on the centre section. The wing had slight dihedral.|$|R
50|$|The Féré F.3 {{is almost}} entirely wooden in {{structure}} and skinning, though some areas are fabric covered. The one piece, low set wing is built around a single box spar, with its leading edge covered in okoumé plywood under an overall fabric covering. The inner sections of the wings have no dihedral but the <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> are set at 5.80°. There are plain, fabric covered ailerons on the <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> but no flaps.|$|R
50|$|The G-27 was {{the only}} Gribovsky design {{with more than one}} engine. It was a wooden {{multi-purpose}} monoplane, intended to provide training in navigation and photo-reconnaissance for its crew of three as well as filling light transport and air ambulance rôles. In plan its wing had a rectangular centre section and straight tapered, two spar <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> with rounded tips. The <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> carried slotted ailerons and the centre section pneumatically operated split flaps.|$|R
50|$|Flight 723 {{was cleared}} for a contact {{approach}} to runway 10. On final approach, while still {{miles west of}} the airport, the Convair descended too low, and at an altitude of 308 ft, struck a set of three 365 ft-tall radio masts arrayed east to west. The right wing struck the center tower of the three, then the left wing struck the east tower. Seven feet of the <b>outer</b> <b>panel</b> of the right wing including the right aileron and control mechanism from the center hinge outboard together with 15 feet of the left outer wing panel and aileron separated from the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|In 1838, Charles Goodyear {{introduced}} {{the use of}} rubber and their discoveries of vulcanisation, which dramatically improved the football. Vulcanisation is the treatment of rubber to give it certain qualities such as strength, elasticity, and resistance to solvents. Vulcanisation of rubber also helps the football resist moderate heat and cold. Vulcanisation helped create inflatable bladders that pressurise the <b>outer</b> <b>panel</b> arrangement of the football. Charles Goodyear's innovation increased the bounce ability of the ball and {{made it easier to}} kick. Most of the balls of this time had tanned leather with eighteen sections stitched together. These were arranged in six panels of three strips each.|$|E

50|$|The LeO H-23 was {{a flying}} boat with a three part {{cantilever}} high wing which was trapezoidal in plan out to roughly elliptical tips. The centre section filled {{just over half}} of the span and was very thick at the roots but the wing thinned continuously outboard over both centre and <b>outer</b> <b>panels.</b> There was about 4.5° of dihedral. Its ailerons were on the <b>outer</b> <b>panels.</b> The wing was completely wooden and covered in plywood.|$|R
50|$|The Crossover has {{a largely}} epoxy resin and carbon fibre structure. The three part wing has a {{rectangular}} plan, 6.5 m span central section and detachable trapezoidal <b>outer</b> <b>panels,</b> each either 1.55 m or 4.25 m {{long for the}} 9.60 m and15.00 m span variants respectively. The wingtips have tall, narrow winglets. The trailing edge of the inner section is filled by two-section, double slotted, electrically driven Fowler flaps, with ailerons on the <b>outer</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{cantilever}} {{wing of the}} Bodiansky 20 was built in three parts, with a short-span, thick, rectangular plan central section and nearly triangular plan <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> which carried 8° of dihedral and thinned linearly outwards. The aspect ratio of the wing, 10.9, was high. Structurally the central section was a welded steel tube part of the fuselage and the <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> were wooden, each with two spars and plywood skinned. Slats, which opened to form the slots, filled the whole leading edges of the <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> and {{were divided into two}} sections. These sections matched the division of the trailing edge into ailerons outboard and flaps inboard. The outer slots opened automatically on the approach of the stall, whereas the inboard slats deployed when the flaps were lowered to their single down setting.|$|R
