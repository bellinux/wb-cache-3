5|$|The Ordinances {{were never}} again reissued, and {{therefore}} hold no permanent {{position in the}} legal history of England {{in the way that}} Magna Carta, for instance, does. The criticism has been against the conservative focus of the barons' role in national politics, ignoring the ascendancy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commons.</b> Yet the document, and the movement behind it, reflected new political developments in its emphasis on how assent was to be obtained by the barons in parliament.

5|$|As {{demands for}} a {{parliament}} grew, Charles took {{the unusual step of}} summoning a great council of peers. By the time it met, on 24 September at York, Charles had resolved to follow the almost universal advice to call a parliament. After informing the peers that a parliament would convene in November, he asked them to consider how he could acquire funds to maintain his army against the Scots in the meantime. They recommended making peace. A cessation of arms, although not a final settlement, was negotiated in the humiliating Treaty of Ripon, signed in October 1640. The treaty stated that the Scots would continue to occupy Northumberland and Durham and be paid £850 per day until peace was restored and the English Parliament recalled, which would be required to raise sufficient funds to pay the Scottish forces. Consequently, Charles summoned what later became known as the Long Parliament. Once again, Charles's supporters fared badly at the polls. Of the 493 members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> returned in November, over 350 were opposed to the king.|$|E
5|$|By 11 May, the {{possibility}} of a deal between the Liberal Democrats and Labour was looking unlikely. Talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats continued, and after concluding {{that he would not be}} able to form a government, Brown announced his resignation that evening. He also resigned as leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect. He then left Downing Street with his wife and their children, and drove to Buckingham Palace where he tendered his resignation to the Queen and advised her to call for David Cameron. Cameron became Prime Minister one hour after the Queen accepted Brown's resignation, and arrived at Downing Street with his wife, Samantha shortly afterwards. In his first address outside 10 Downing Street, he announced his intention to form a coalition government, the first since the Second World War, with the Liberal Democrats. Cameron appointed Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister. Cameron met with his MPs in the Committee Room of the House of Commons at 10.00pm, where he was greeted with cheering that could be heard from the central hall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commons.</b>|$|E
5|$|Coke {{undertook}} {{the central}} role in framing and writing the Petition of Right. The ongoing struggles over martial law and civil liberties, along with {{the rejection of the}} Resolutions seriously concerned the Commons. Accordingly, Coke convinced the Lords to meet with the Commons in April 1628 in order to discuss a petition to the King confirming the rights and liberties of royal subjects. The Commons immediately accepted this, and after a struggle, the Lords agreed to allow a committee chaired by Coke to draft the eventual document. Hearing of this, the King sent a message to Parliament forbidding the Commons from discussing matters of state. The resulting debate led to some MPs being unable to speak due to their fear that the King was threatening them with the destruction of Parliament. Coke, despite the fear in Parliament, stood and spoke, citing historical precedents supporting the principle that members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> could, within Parliament, say whatever they wished – something now codified as Parliamentary privilege.|$|E

5|$|In November 1960, Lord Stansgate died. Benn {{automatically}} {{became a}} peer, preventing him from {{sitting in the}} House of Commons. The Speaker <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commons,</b> Sir Harry Hylton-Foster, did not allow him to deliver a speech from the bar of the House of Commons in April 1961 when the by-election was being called. Continuing to maintain his right to abandon his peerage, Benn fought to retain his seat in a by-election caused by his succession on 4 May 1961. Although he was disqualified from taking his seat, he was re-elected. An election court found that the voters were fully aware that Benn was disqualified, and declared the seat won by the Conservative runner-up, Malcolm St Clair, {{who was at the}} time also the heir presumptive to a peerage.|$|E
5|$|In response, the House of Commons {{prepared}} {{a set of}} four Resolutions, decrying these actions and restating the validity of Magna Carta and the legal requirement of habeas corpus. These were rejected by Charles, who also announced that Parliament would be dissolved; in response, the Commons met on 6 May to discuss alternatives, and concluded that a petition of right was the way forward. Accordingly, a committee under Sir Edward Coke drafted such a petition, and it {{was passed by the}} Commons on 8 May and sent to the House of Lords. After three weeks of debates and conferences between the two chambers, the Petition of Right was ratified by both houses on the 26th and 27 May. Following additional debates in which the King restricted the right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> to freely speak, he bowed to the pressure; in need of Parliamentary support for the war effort, the Petition was accepted on 2 June. Unhappy with the method chosen, both houses joined together and demanded the King fully ratify the Petition, which he did on 7 June.|$|E
5|$|Military failure abroad, and the {{associated}} fiscal pressure of constant campaigns, led to political discontent at home. The problems {{came to a head}} in the parliament of 1376, the so-called Good Parliament. The parliament was called to grant taxation, but the House of Commons took the opportunity to address specific grievances. In particular, criticism was directed at some of the king's closest advisors. Chamberlain William Latimer and Steward of the Household John Neville were dismissed from their positions. Edward's mistress, Alice Perrers, who was seen to hold far too much power over the ageing king, was banished from court. Yet the real adversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commons,</b> supported by powerful men such as Wykeham and Edmund de Mortimer, Earl of March, was John of Gaunt. Both the king and the Black Prince were by this time incapacitated by illness, leaving Gaunt in virtual control of government. Gaunt was forced to give in to the demands of parliament, but at its next convocation, in 1377, most of the achievements of the Good Parliament were reversed.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores <b>the</b> Aristotelian/Catholic <b>common</b> good {{tradition}} {{with a view}} towards making <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> good accessible to economists. <b>The</b> <b>common</b> good is by definition <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> society.

There are three justifications for society in <b>the</b> <b>common</b> good literature that are not commonly discussed in economics: sociability, character formation, and the natural orientation toward society's good. The first and third elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> good might be incorporated into economics with little fuss. The second justification is <b>the</b> most subversive <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economic conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> good, because it refuses to take human preferences as given, and therefore rejects preferences as normative. One cannot talk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> good unless one is willing to evaluate preferences by some external measure...|$|R

5|$|Prior to the 16th century, the Lords was the {{stronger}} {{of the two}} houses of Parliament. A process of gradual developments combined with such moments of crisis as the English Civil Wars transferred the political control of England, first from the Crown to the House of Lords {{and then to the}} House of Commons. The rising wealth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> eventually allowed it to wage two civil wars, dethrone two Kings, and gradually reduce the power of the Lords. Prior to the House of Lords Act 1999, the power of the Lords had been diminished by the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 which stripped the Lords of the ability to block, or veto, adoption of most bills; at most it could delay bills for one year. Furthermore, the Commons has absolute power when it comes to money bills.|$|E
5|$|Richard's {{government}} was formed around his uncles, most prominently {{the rich and}} powerful John of Gaunt, and many of his grandfather's former senior officials. They faced the challenge of financially sustaining the war in France. Taxes in the 14th century were raised on an ad hoc basis through Parliament, then comprising the Lords, the titled aristocracy and clergy; and the Commons, the representatives of the knights, merchants and senior gentry from across England. These taxes were typically imposed on a household's movable possessions, such as their goods or stock. The raising of these taxes affected the members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> much more than the Lords. To complicate matters, the official statistics used to administer the taxes pre-dated the Black Death and, since the size and wealth of local communities had changed greatly since the plague, effective collection had become increasingly difficult.|$|E

5|$|Simon de Montfort {{had seized}} power in England {{following}} his victory over Henry III at the Battle of Lewes during the Second Barons' War, but {{his grip on}} the country was under threat. In an attempt to gather more support he summoned representatives from not only the barons and the knights of the shires, as had occurred in previous parliaments, but also burgesses from the major towns. The resulting parliament in London discussed radical reforms and temporarily stabilised Montfort's political situation. Montfort was killed at the Battle of Evesham later that year, but the idea of inviting both knights and burgesses to parliaments became more popular under the reign of Henry's son Edward I. By the 14th century this had become the norm, with the gathering becoming known as the House of Commons. This parliament is sometimes referred to as the first English parliament and Montfort himself is often termed the founder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commons.</b>|$|E
5|$|The English Parliament distrusted Charles's motivations when {{he called}} for funds {{to put down the}} Irish rebellion; many members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> {{suspected}} that forces raised by Charles might later be used against Parliament itself. Pym's Militia Bill was intended to wrest control of the army from the king, but it did not have the support of the Lords, let alone Charles. Instead, the Commons passed the bill as an ordinance, which they claimed did not require royal assent. The Militia Ordinance appears to have prompted more members of the Lords to support the king. In an attempt to strengthen his position, Charles generated great antipathy in London, which was already fast falling into anarchy, when he placed the Tower of London under the command of Colonel Thomas Lunsford, an infamous, albeit efficient, career officer. When rumours reached Charles that Parliament intended to impeach his wife for supposedly conspiring with the Irish rebels, the king decided to take drastic action.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} nature {{is indicated by}} the use of the expression ecosystem services to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free. In general, as a commodity or service becomes more scarce the price increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages frugality, technical innovation and alternative products. However, this only applies when the product or service falls within the market system. As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic externalities they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded, a situation sometimes referred to as the Tragedy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commons.</b>|$|E

A three-element model that represents <b>the</b> <b>common</b> carotid arterial system in the electrical circuit was constructed; the elements were the non-elastic resistance and compliance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> carotid artery and the total peripheral resistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> carotid arterial system. In this model, the blood pressure waveform was utilized as a voltage source, while the carotid artery blood flow waveform was utilized as the current. <b>The</b> pulse waveform <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> carotid artery that fitted the systolic and diastolic blood pressures measured in the brachial artery was used instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blood pressure waveform <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> carotid artery. <b>The</b> non-elastic resistance and compliance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> carotid artery and the total peripheral resistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system were calculated from the alternate blood pressure waveform and blood flow waveform using an approximate calculation method that we proposed. <b>The</b> parameters <b>of</b> three elements during retrocollis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neck were as follows: <b>the</b> non-elastic resistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> carotid artery increased and <b>the</b> compliance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> carotid artery decreased and the total peripheral resistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system increased, compared {{to those in the}} normal supine posture.

5|$|The final Gallup poll {{before the}} {{election}} showed the Liberals ahead, 48% to 34%. Just {{before the election}}, Maclean's magazine printed its regular weekly issue, to go on sale {{the morning after the}} vote, editorializing that democracy in Canada was still strong despite a sixth consecutive Liberal victory. On election night, the Progressive Conservative advance started early, with the gain of two seats in reliably Liberal Newfoundland. The party picked up nine seats in Nova Scotia, five in Quebec, 28 in Ontario, and at least one seat in every other province. The Progressive Conservatives took 112 seats to the Liberals' 105: a plurality, but not a majority. While the Liberals finished some 200,000 votes ahead of the Tories nationally, that margin was mostly wasted in overwhelming victories in safe Quebec seats. St. Laurent could have legally stayed in office until Diefenbaker could defeat him on the floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commons.</b> However, with the minor parties pledging to cooperate with a Tory government, St. Laurent chose not to do so, making Diefenbaker Prime Minister-designate of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Sir Walter Hungerford {{inherited}} Farleigh Hungerford castle {{upon the}} death of his mother, Joan, in 1412. Walter's first political patron was John of Gaunt's son, Henry IV, and later he became a close companion of Henry's own son, Henry V; Henry V made Walter, like his father before him, the Speaker <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> in 1414. Walter prospered: he became known as an expert jouster, in 1415 fought at the battle of Agincourt during the Hundred Years War, was made Steward of the Royal Household and was a major figure in government during the 1420s, serving as the Treasurer of England and as one of the legal guardians of the young Henry VI. Despite having to pay a ransom of £3,000 to the French after his son was captured in 1429, Walter, by now created Baron Hungerford, amassed considerable wealth from his various sources of income, which included the right to one hundred marks (£66) per year from the town of Marlborough, the wool taxes from Wells, and the ransoms gained from the taking of French prisoners. As a result, he was able to buy more land, acquiring around 110 new manors and estates {{over the course of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|With {{the failure}} of the Spanish match, Charles and Buckingham turned their {{attention}} to France. On 1 May 1625 Charles was married by proxy to the fifteen-year-old French princess Henrietta Maria in front of the doors of the Notre Dame de Paris. Charles had seen Henrietta Maria in Paris while en route to Spain. The couple married in person on 13 June 1625 in Canterbury. Charles delayed the opening of his first Parliament until after the second ceremony, to forestall any opposition. Many members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> were opposed to the king's marriage to a Roman Catholic, fearing that Charles would lift restrictions on Catholic recusants and undermine the official establishment of the reformed Church of England. Although he told Parliament that he would not relax religious restrictions, he promised to do exactly that in a secret marriage treaty with his brother-in-law Louis XIII of France. Moreover, the treaty loaned to the French seven English naval ships that would be used to suppress the Protestant Huguenots at La Rochelle in September 1625. Charles was crowned on 2 February 1626 at Westminster Abbey, but without his wife at his side because she refused to participate in a Protestant religious ceremony.|$|E
