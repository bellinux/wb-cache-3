For the next few years the CPGB was the main focus of her political activity, although she kept her membership in the Labour Party, which at the time accepted dual CPGB/Labour memberships.|$|E

JC is contacted by Tong, Everett, and the Helios AI simultaneously.

Tong seeks to plunge the world into a Dark Age by destroying the global communications hub and preventing anyone from taking control of the world. Everett offers Denton the chance to bring the Illuminati back to power by killing Bob Page and using the technology of Area 51 to rule the world with an invisible hand. Helios wishes to merge with Denton and rule the world as a benevolent dictator with infinite knowledge and reason. The player's decision determines the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>and</b> brings the game to a close.|$|E

25|$|Martin Ford, {{author of}} The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future,</b> <b>and</b> {{others argue that}} {{specialized}} artificial intelligence applications, robotics {{and other forms of}} automation will ultimately result in significant unemployment as machines begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine and repetitive jobs. Ford predicts that many knowledge-based occupations—and in particular entry level jobs—will be increasingly susceptible to automation via expert systems, machine learning and other AI-enhanced applications. AI-based applications may also be used to amplify the capabilities of low-wage offshore workers, making it more feasible to outsource knowledge work.|$|E

40|$|As <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> {{globalization}} of trading and competition among exchanges for order flow accelerates, {{it is important}} to determine the information revelation and price discovery in informationally-linked markets. This paper examines the intradaily price discovery process of Nikkei 225 index in three competing markets [...] the domestic spot market (Tokyo Stock Exchange), <b>the</b> domestic <b>futures</b> market (Osaka Securities Exchange), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> foreign <b>futures</b> market (Singapore Exchange). The evidence suggests that <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> market contributes more than 75 % to price discovery, with the Osaka Securities Exchange contributing more than 57 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> markets <b>and</b> 43 % of total information share. Surprisingly, the Singapore Exchange has a contribution of 43 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> <b>and</b> 33 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total price discovery, which far exceed its share of trading volume. This suggests that a small “satellite” market can co-exist with a large “home” market and {{play a significant role in}} the price discovery process by being a niche player...|$|R
25|$|Mary {{is alone}} in the stable in Bethlehem with the baby Jesus when she {{receives}} a visitation from an angel. He tells the virgin {{that she has been}} permitted a glimpse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>and</b> shows Jesus alone and afraid in the Garden of Gethsemane as He prays before his arrest, then a vision of Jesus carrying His cross on the way to His crucifixion, and then finally on the cross as He is declared by the High Priest as a blasphemer. The angel offers Mary the choice of giving the baby back to God to avoid these agonies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>and</b> tells her that she should regard the choice as hers alone with no compunction from God himself. Mary suddenly remembers the smile on her son's face as He looked on His sleeping disciples in Gethsemane and a similar look on the face of one of the criminals also on a cross at Golgotha. She refuses the offer that the angel makes to her. He vanishes as Joseph comes into the stable. The angel is then revealed to be Satan in disguised form who vows to come back one day and tempt Jesus himself. As he flashes through the sky towards hell, his passage is mistaken for a star by the Three Wise Men.|$|E

25|$|In 1847, {{two great}} {{literary}} {{figures of the}} Arab cultural renaissance, Butrus Al-Bustani and Nasif Al-Yaziji, founded the first literary society, Jam'iyyat al-Adab wal-'Ulum (The Literary and Scientific Society). Its members were exclusively Syrian Christians and Europeans {{living and working in}} diplomatic and missionary circles. However, ten years later, al-Jam'iyya al-'Ilmiyya al-Suriyya (The Syrian Scientific Society) was established, and attracted Western-educated Muslims and Druze as well as Christians. In 1917, the Tunisian literary figure, Hassan Hosni Abdel-Wahab wrote about the urgent need for educated Muslim young women to take charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>and</b> to 'awaken the nationalist spirit', as without this, 'life would turn to nihilism and its consequences'. Only a few years later in the 1920s, Manwia Al-Wartani and Habiba al-Minshari, became the leaders of a dynamic women's movement in Tunisia. Like these Tunisian pioneers, women of the upper and middle classes across the increasingly imagined Arab world began to reap the benefits of education, and many of them began to focus on writing and joined their male counterparts in contributing to the Arab Renaissance.|$|E
