40|$|We {{study the}} {{synchronization}} problem of dynamical systems {{in case of}} a hierarchical structure among them, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>interest</b> comes from the growing necessity of understanding properties of complex systems, that often exhibit such an organization. Starting with a set of 2 n systems, we define a hierarchical structure inside it by a matrix representing all the steps of a matching process in groups of size 2. This leads us naturally to the synchronization of a Cantor set of systems, indexed by 0, 1 ^: we obtain a global synchronization result generalizing the finite case. In the same context, we deal with this question when some defects appear in the hierarchy, that is to say when some links between certain systems are broken. We prove we can allow an infinite number of broken links inside the hierarchy while keeping a local synchronization, under the condition that these defects are present at the N smallest scales of the hierarchy (for a fixed integer N) and they be enough spaced out in those scales...|$|E
40|$|In general, the {{findings}} of this research help us to call into question any easy notion raised by the Little Divergence theory, that the economy of northwest Europe was increasingly ‘better’ or ‘more efficient’ than that of {{much of the rest of}} Europe from the medieval period through the early modern period. The over-reliance on wages, that the Little Divergence theory has heretofore done, should be called into question, and other indicators should be provided in order to create a more nuanced picture of what was actually occurring. Additional evidence will show that the Little Divergence was not as pronounced as is currently believed. More specifically, although differences in government types increased and considerable levels of direct integration between very distant states across Europe have not been proven, findings suggest that countries throughout Europe from the seventeenth century onwards were learning how to create effective public debt systems <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>interest</b> rates suggest that they were not markedly different from those that are supposed to be the most sophisticated European economies (i. e. the Netherlands and England). This means that they were effectively adopting the most sophisticated financial models available to their own local situations. This resulted in a convergence of financial practices that helped to integrate the economies of Europe, at a time when the Little Divergence is supposed to have been separating them. This paper’s general finding is that interest rates suggest that, in some ways, the early modern period experienced a ‘Little Convergence’ rather than a ‘Little Divergence. ’ It will show that the common notion of northwest European countries being economically more successful than the rest of the continent needs considerable nuance...|$|E
40|$|Little {{transparency}} in the EU black?box of policy making {{means that there}} is limited citizen knowledge <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>interest</b> groups are operating in Brussels, what they seek to influence, how much resources they put into lobbying and the impact this has had on EU?s already large democratic deficit. As such, mass publics have held few tools to better understand, and get involved in changing, EU politics. In order to combat this problem, observers have considered the need to pursue 2 ̆ 7 sunshine 2 ̆ 7 laws, a significant one being the regulation of lobbying. With this in mind, this paper asks: what has the Commission done with regard to regulating lobbyists and how does this compare from an international perspective; what insights can be gained about how the Commission register has evolved and the actors involved in policy making; and what lessons can be learned from this experience and is it really an antidote for the lack of genuine popular involvement in EU policy making? To answer these questions, there are three main sections. The first examines what is meant by the term 2 ̆ 7 lobbying regulation 2 ̆ 7 and, from a comparative international perspective, it analyzes the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s attempts to increase transparency through its establishment of its 2 ̆ 7 voluntary 2 ̆ 7 register in June 2008. The second considers the evolution of the register since its establishment, offering a novel, yet simple, analysis of the register 2 ̆ 7 s statistics between June 2008 and October 2010, focusing on registrations by consultancies, law firms, in?house corporate lobbies, NGOs and others. It also considers registration dynamics {{in one of the most}} significant and globalized sectors in the economy, namely the automobile sector. The third section closes with lessons to be learned from a comparative perspective and ponders the structural changes that may be considered by the Commission in order to establish genuine popular involvement in EU policy making...|$|E
