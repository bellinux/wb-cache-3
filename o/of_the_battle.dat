Model arranged for units to be sent straight to the units in action {{in order to avoid}} long-winded logistics, and rushed in specialist urban warfare and machine gun battalions. Each day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle,</b> the German military strength increased whilst the British supplies diminished. By 21 September, the fifth day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle,</b> German forces outnumbered the British by 3:1 and continued to increase.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{following}} the Second World War, very little attention {{was paid to}} the Battle of Vimy Ridge or the Vimy Memorial.

Interest in commemoration remained low in the early 1960s but increased in 1967 with the 50th anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle,</b> paired with the Canadian Centennial. A heavily attended ceremony at the memorial in April 1967 was broadcast live on television.
