40|$|Nowadays, new {{emerging}} products claiming antioxidant {{properties are}} becoming more frequent. However, information about this topic in their labels is usually scarce. In this paper, we analyzed total phenolics, total flavonoids and ascorbic acid contents, as well as DPPH scavenging activity of several commercial samples, namely green tea and <b>other</b> <b>herbal</b> <b>infusions,</b> dietary supplements, and fruit juices, available in the Portuguese market. In general, beverages containing green tea and hibiscus showed higher phenolics contents (including flavonoids) and antioxidant activity than those without these ingredients. A borututu infusion presented the lowest concentrations of bioactive compounds and scavenging activity, due to the low recommended amount of plant to prepare the beverage. Some juices without antioxidant claims in the label presented similar values to those with it...|$|E
40|$|Backgrounds and Objective: Kombucha is a several {{thousand}} years old traditional fermented beverage originated from East. While black tea infusion {{is the common}} substrate for preparing kombucha, <b>other</b> <b>herbal</b> <b>infusions</b> can be applied for this reason too. Common medicinal herbs or even waste herbal materials, like banana peel, could be suitable substrates for preparing kombucha analogues. In this study, kombuchas were fermented using nettles leaf and banana peel infusions.   Materials and Methods: Herbal infusions were fermented by kombucha fungi. Folin-Ciocalteu assay was performed to evaluate total phenolic contents; Free radical scavenging activity was evaluated using 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl. Disk diffusion method was performed to measure inhibitory activity against testing bacteria. All data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA test at significant level of p≤ 0. 05.   Results and Conclusion: Black tea contained highest amount of phenolics (530. 5 ppm gallic acid equivalent) and fermentation decomposed approximately 50 % of phenolic contents to 265. 5 ppm while phenolic content of nettles infusion and fermented beverage were 173 gAE and 188 gAE respectively and for banana peel, 136. 5 gAE and 155 gAE; it indicated increase of phenolic contents due to fermentation that may be cause of protein contents of nettles and banana peel gone under fermentation by lactic acid bacteria. Fermented beverage of three herbs had higher antioxidant potent than infusions. Kombucha from banana peel showed the highest antioxidant activity by inhibiting 94. 62 % of DPPH. While antioxidant activity of fermented beverages of black tea and nettles leaf were more related to their acetic acid content, {{it was found that}} a considerable part of antioxidant activity of banana peel kombucha was due to other acids and phenolics. No antibacterial activity was observed from either of samples. Banana peel, as a waste herbal material, and nettles leaf are good ingredients for being used as substrate to make antioxidant kombucha beverage. </p...|$|E

40|$|Complex {{formation}} {{is among the}} mechanisms affecting metals’ bioaccessibility. Evaluating the extent of interactions between trace elements and several constituents of food items is of great interest. This paper examines the release of copper-complexing ligands in <b>herbal</b> <b>infusions</b> of 13 aromatic plants commonly used in Greece. The concentration of ligands (LT) and the copper-binding strength (logKapp) of <b>herbal</b> <b>infusions</b> were determined with Differential Pulse Anodic Stripping Voltammetry (DPASV). All <b>herbal</b> <b>infusions</b> were found to release Cu complexing ligands, at concentrations ranging from 8. 8 to 112. 5 μM in rosemary and marjoram, respectively. In all infusions the total copper concentrations were lower than the corresponding LT values, indicating that Cu is fully complexed.

According to EFSA, the residue data are sufficient to support the extrapolation of residue data on dried peppermint, lemon balm leaves, narrow leaf plantain and camomile flowers to the whole group of dried leaves and flowers of <b>herbal</b> <b>infusions</b> with a MRL proposal of 0. 4 mg/kg.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{consumption}} of tea and <b>herbal</b> <b>infusions</b> has increased. These hot drinks are consumed as daily drinks {{as well as for}} medicinal purposes. All tea varieties (white, yellow, green, oolong, black and puerh) originate from the leaves of the tea plant, Camellia sinensis. All extracts made of plant or herbal materials which do not contain Camellia sinensis are referred as <b>herbal</b> <b>infusions</b> or tisanes. During processing and manufacturing fungal contamination of the plant materials is possible, enabling contamination of these products with mycotoxins. In this study a multimycotoxin UPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the analysis of the raw tea and <b>herbal</b> <b>infusion</b> materials as well as for their drinkable products. The samples were analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), with a mobile phase consisting of variable mixtures of water and methanol with 0. 3 % formic acid. The limits of detection for the different mycotoxins varied between 2. 1 mu g/kg and 121 mu g/kg for raw materials and between 0. 4 mu g/L and 46 mu g/L for drinkable products.

In addition, some bioactive components in the infusions were also separated and determined by HPLC.

In order to accommodate for the intended uses Germany proposed to raise the existing MRLs to 0. 2 mg/kg on salsify, to 0. 5 mg/kg for the group of <b>herbal</b> <b>infusions</b> (roots) and to 0. 3 mg/kg on spices (seeds) and on caraway, whereas the intended uses on swedes, turnips, celeriac and celery were not sufficiently supported by data and no amendment of the MRLs was proposed. Germany drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005 which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to propose a MRL of 0. 2 mg/kg on salsify, 0. 5 mg/kg on <b>herbal</b> <b>infusions</b> (roots) and 0. 05 mg/kg (LOQ) on spices (seeds) and on caraway. The intended uses on swedes, turnips, celeriac and celery are not adequately supported by residue data and no MRL proposals can be therefore derived. Analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of pendimethalin in the crops under consideration, which are fully validated on salsify matrices; further validation data would be desirable on <b>herbal</b> <b>infusions</b> and spices.
