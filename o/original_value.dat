Playfair's calculations had raised the density closer towards its modern value, but was still too low and significantly poorer than Cavendish's computation of some years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Heartland Food Corporation (Heartland) {{came into}} {{existence}} when Miami-based franchisee Al Cabrera purchased {{a large chunk of}} stores, 130 locations primarily in the Chicago and the upper mid-west, from the failed franchise AmeriKing for a bargain basement price of $16million, or approximately 88% of their <b>original</b> <b>value</b> in December 2003. Taking these stores, he and his partners created a new company called Core Value Partners to renovate and update the locations which had deteriorated during Ameriking's decline. During this time, the company was renamed Heartland Food Corp. and it purchased 120 additional stores from other financially distressed owners and completely revamped them as well. The resulting purchases made Mr. Cabrerra Burger King's largest minority franchisee and Heartland one of BKC's top franchisee groups at the time. By 2006, the company was valued at over $150million, and was sold to New York-based GSO Capital Partners.|$|E
5|$|The code of Mongol law, {{known as}} the Yassa ("Great Law"), decreed strict rules and punishments {{in many areas of}} the Mongolian Empire's society, {{especially}} those areas concerning trade and commerce. The Yassa helped suppress the traditional causes of tribal feuding and war, thus helping to ensure a peaceful trading and travelling environment; theft and animal rustling were outlawed, and the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan even established a massive lost-and-found system. Harsh penalties including a retribution of nine times the <b>original</b> <b>value</b> of stolen goods helped deter theft on Mongol roads. The Yassa also decreed complete religious freedom, ensuring that Buddhists, Muslims, Christians, etc., were all allowed to travel freely throughout the empire; religious leaders were also exempted from taxation, as were doctors, lawyers, undertakers, teachers, and scholars. The Yassa did allow for flexibility and it usually adapted, absorbed, or built upon legal systems in remote parts of the empire, thus maintaining a level of openness to various societies and ensuring peace and stability.|$|E

5|$|The season's {{activity}} was reflected with an ACE rating of approximately 165 units, the highest since 2005, and the eleventh highest value since 1944 at the time. Broadly speaking, ACE {{is a measure}} of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration, such as Igor, will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39mph (63km/h). Accordingly, tropical depressions are not included in the count. After the storm has dissipated, typically after the end of the season, the NHC re-examines the data and produces a final report on each storm. These revisions can lead to a revised ACE total either upward or downward compared to the <b>original</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E
5|$|Each round {{began with}} a toss-up {{physical}} challenge in which both teams competed, with the winning team receiving both initial control of the round, and money for their score. After the toss-up, the host began asking trivia questions of the team in control. Each correct answer earned a monetary award, and allowed the team to maintain control, while an incorrect answer, or failure to respond within approximately ten seconds turned control over to the opponents. However, the team could dare their opponents to answer the question, doubling its value; in response, the opponents could double dare for quadruple the <b>original</b> <b>value.</b> When the team in control was challenged to a double dare, they had to either answer or compete in a physical challenge. An incorrect answer, or not responding within approximately five seconds on a dare or double dare, awarded both control and the appropriate {{amount of money to}} the team that issued it. The second round played the same as the first, with question values doubled. On Double Dare and Super Sloppy Double Dare, a question was initially worth $10. On Family Double Dare and Double Dare 2000, a question was initially worth $25.|$|E
5|$|Individual owners took {{advantage}} of the AmeriKing failure; one of the BK regional owners, Miami-based Al Cabrera, purchased 130 stores located primarily in the Chicago and the upper mid-west, from the failed company for a bargain basement price of $16million, or approximately 88 percent of their <b>original</b> <b>value.</b> The new company, which started out as Core Value Partners and eventually became Heartland Foods, also purchased 120 additional stores from distressed owners and completely revamped them. The resulting purchases made Mr. Cabrerra BKB's largest minority franchisee and Heartland one of Burger King's top franchises. By 2006, the company was valued at over $150million, and was sold to New York-based GSO Capital Partners. Other purchasers included a three-way group of NFL athletes Kevin Faulk, Marcus Allen and Michael Strahan who collectively purchased 17 stores in the cities of Norfolk and Richmond, Virginia; and Cincinnati-based franchisee Dave Devoy, who purchased 32 AmeriKing stores. After investing in new decor, equipment and staff retraining, many of the formerly failing stores have shown growth upwards of 20 percent.|$|E

50|$|Most of the school’s proponents {{assume that}} today’s Indonesian {{people are in}} the {{position}} of being blind to their <b>original</b> <b>values.</b> Jakob Sumardjo, for instance, argued that most of today’s Indonesians …forget to preserve their <b>original</b> <b>values</b> and …forgetting the past, forgetting the origin, they are like amnesiac people... who …ignore their own national history… (Sumardjo 2003:23, 25). Consequently, they are ‘alienated’; estranged from ‘their mother cultures’ (Sumardjo 2003:53). The failure of Indonesian educational policy, to Jakob, is brought by this ‘blindness’ to Indonesian original culture (Sumardjo 2003:58). Therefore, the necessary task of this school of philosophy is to seek after, recall and revitalize the ethnic <b>original</b> <b>values,</b> since the values are ‘mothers’ (lokalitas ialah ibu manusia) and people are ‘fathers’ of existence (balita ialah bapak manusia) (Sumardjo 2003:22).|$|R

25|$|When {{a number}} is {{represented}} in some format (such as a character string) {{which is not a}} native floating-point representation supported in a computer implementation, then it will require a conversion before it can be used in that implementation. If the number can be represented exactly in the floating-point format then the conversion is exact. If there is not an exact representation then the conversion requires a choice of which floating-point number to use to represent the <b>original</b> <b>value.</b> The representation chosen will have a different value from the original, and the value thus adjusted is called the rounded value.|$|E
25|$|The {{gains from}} the {{exploitation}} of rubber through the state and other companies like the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company (ABIR) were huge. The <b>original</b> <b>value</b> in 1892 of the ABIR shares was 500 francs. In 1903 the shares had risen to 15,000 gold francs. The dividend in 1892 was 1 franc, but by 1903 the dividend was 1,200 francs. These enormous gains came from horrible exploitation, and what Edmund Morel described as slavery. The scope of the destruction, together with disease and famine from forced labour, is estimated to have killed half of the native population of the colony.|$|E

25|$|Inspired by the 1924 Le Mans win by John Duff and Frank Clement, Barnato {{agreed to}} finance Bentley's business. Barnato had {{incorporated}} Baromans Ltd in 1922, which effectively existed as his finance and investment vehicle. Via Baromans, Barnato initially invested {{in excess of}} £100,000, saving {{the company and its}} workforce. A subsequent agreed wind-up of the original Bentley company was agreed, with all existing creditors paid off for £75,000, but with existing shares devalued from £1.00 each to just 1 shilling, or 5% or their <b>original</b> <b>value.</b> Barnato held 149,500 of the new shares, meaning that he controlled the company, and became chairman. Barnato injected further cash into the business: £35,000 as a debenture in July 1927; £40,000 in 1928; £25,000 in 1929.|$|E
25|$|Each rating list {{runs for}} five years, and may change within that time. The value {{from the very}} start of the list can be altered, or events within the life of the list (such as an extension) can be {{reflected}} by changes within the list, leading to different values at different times. For example, a property is entered in a rating list at 1 April 2005 with a rateable value of £10,000, and a year later the property is extended causing an increase to £12,000 from 1 April 2006; the original entry of £10,000 remains unchanged for the first year. A successful proposal could alter this <b>original</b> <b>value</b> of £10,000 to £9000 from 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2006, but the second entry from 1 April 2006 would remain unchanged at £12,000.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to small base-metal coins, the Ming issued fiat paper currency {{as the standard}} currency {{from the beginning of}} the reign until 1450, by which point – like its predecessors – it was suffering from hyperinflation and rampant counterfeiting. (In 1425, Ming notes were trading at about 0.014% of its <b>original</b> <b>value</b> under the Hongwu Emperor.) Monetary needs were initially met by bullion trading in silver sycee, but a shortage of silver in the mid-15th century caused a severe monetary contraction and forced a great deal of trade to be conducted by barter. China had not been much interested in European or Japanese goods but the silver of Iwami Ginzan and Potosí was too profitable and important to restrict. Inflows of Japanese and Spanish silver monetized China's economy, and Spanish dollars became a common medium of exchange.|$|E

25|$|As {{rail lines}} pushed {{further and further}} into the wilderness, they opened up huge areas that would have {{otherwise}} lain fallow. The railroads helped establish countless towns and settlements, paved the way to abundant mineral deposits and fertile tracts of pastures and farmland, and created new markets for eastern goods. It is estimated {{that by the end}} of World War II, rail companies nationwide remunerated to the government over $1 billion dollars, more than eight times the <b>original</b> <b>value</b> of the lands granted. The principal commodity transported across the rails to California was people: by reducing the cross-country travel time to as little as six days, men with westward ambitions were no longer forced to leave their families behind. The railroads would, in time, provide equally important linkages to move the inhabitants throughout the state, interconnecting its blossoming communities.|$|E
25|$|The Hongwu Emperor {{was unaware}} of {{economic}} inflation even {{as he continued to}} hand out multitudes of banknotes as awards; by 1425, paper currency was worth only 0.025% to 0.014% its <b>original</b> <b>value</b> in the 14th century. The value of standard copper coinage dropped significantly as well due to counterfeit minting; by the 16th century, new maritime trade contacts with Europe provided massive amounts of imported silver, which increasingly became the common medium of exchange. As far back as 1436, a portion of the southern grain tax was commuted to silver, known as the Gold Floral Silver (jinhuayin). This was an effort to aid tax collection in counties where transportation of grain was made difficult by terrain, as well as provide tax relief to landowners. In 1581 the Single Whip Reform installed by Grand Secretary Zhang Juzheng (1525–1582) finally assessed taxes on the amount of land paid entirely in silver.|$|E
25|$|In {{the domain}} of finance and banking, Paris was far behind other European capitals, and even other French cities. The first venture of Paris into modern finance was {{launched}} by the Scottish economist John Law, who, encouraged by the Regent, in 1716 started a private bank and issued paper money. Law invested heavily in the Mississippi Company, causing wild speculation, with shares rising to sixty times their <b>original</b> <b>value.</b> The bubble burst in 1720, and Law closed the bank and fled the country, ruining many Parisian investors. Thereafter, Parisians were suspicious of banks and bankers. The Bourse, or Paris stock market, did not open until 24 September 1724 on rue Vivienne, in the former hôtel de Nevers, long after stock markets had existed in Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux, Toulouse and other cities. The Banque de France was not founded until 1800, long after the Bank of Amsterdam (1609), and the Bank of England (1694).|$|E
