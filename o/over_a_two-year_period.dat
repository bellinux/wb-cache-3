5|$|Alligator weed was {{introduced}} to the United States from South America. It takes root in shallow water, interfering with navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The alligator weed flea beetle and two other biological controls were released in Florida, greatly reducing the amount of land covered by the plant. Another aquatic weed, the giant salvinia (Salvinia molesta) is a serious pest, covering waterways, reducing water flow and harming native species. Control with the salvinia weevil (Cyrtobagous salviniae) and the salvinia stem-borer moth (Samea multiplicalis) is effective in warm climates, and in Zimbabwe, a 99% control of the weed was obtained <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>two-year</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lautner was {{initially}} {{supposed to be}} in two films, Northern Lights and a movie based on Max Steel, but pulled out of both films due to scheduling conflicts and better offers. Other planned projects were the lead in a movie about Stretch Armstrong and a hostage thriller, Cancun. Lautner filmed a Bourne Identity-esque spy film with Lily Collins, entitled Abduction. It was released in September 2011 to universally negative reviews from critics and Lautner's performance was heavily criticised. He appeared in the remaining parts of the Twilight series, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn films, which were released <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>two-year</b> <b>period</b> from 2011–2012.|$|E
5|$|Loveless is {{the second}} studio album by Irish rock band My Bloody Valentine, {{released}} on 4 November 1991 by Creation Records. The album was recorded <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>two-year</b> <b>period</b> between 1989 and 1991. Vocalist and guitarist Kevin Shields dominated the arduous recording process; intent on achieving a particular sound, he experimented with texturised guitar tremolo techniques and tuning systems, unorthodox production methods, obscured vocals, and sampled percussion and feedback. The group cycled through nineteen studios and {{a larger number of}} engineers during the album's two-year creation, with total recording costs rumoured to have reached £250,000.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} went mostly unnoticed {{upon its}} live broadcast. However, {{four years after}} the production of Casino Royale, CBS invited Fleming to write 32 episodes <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>two-year</b> <b>period</b> for a television show based on the James Bond character. Fleming agreed and began to write outlines for this series. When nothing ever came of this, however, Fleming grouped and adapted three of the outlines into short stories and released the 1960 anthology For Your Eyes Only along with an additional two new short stories.|$|E
5|$|During that time, Shapiro {{instructed}} ex-captive orangutans in {{the acquisition}} {{and use of}} signs following the techniques of psychologists R. Allen Gardner and Beatrix Gardner, who taught the chimpanzee, Washoe, in the late 1960s. In the only signing study ever conducted in a great ape's natural environment, Shapiro home-reared Princess, a juvenile female, which learned nearly 40 signs (according to the criteria of sign acquisition used by psychologist Francine Patterson with Koko, the gorilla) and trained Rinnie, a free-ranging adult female orangutan, which learned nearly 30 signs <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>two-year</b> <b>period.</b> For his dissertation study, Shapiro examined the factors influencing sign learning by four juvenile orangutans over a 15-month period.|$|E
5|$|The {{qualification}} process can start {{as early as}} almost three years before the final tournament and last <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>two-year</b> <b>period.</b> The formats of the qualification tournaments differ between confederations. Usually, one or two places are awarded to winners of intercontinental play-offs. For example, {{the winner of the}} Oceanian zone and the fifth-placed team from the Asian zone entered a play-off for a spot in the 2010 World Cup. From the 1938 World Cup onwards, host nations receive automatic qualification to the final tournament. This right was also granted to the defending champions between 1938 and 2002, but was withdrawn from the 2006 FIFA World Cup onward, requiring the champions to qualify. Brazil, winners in 2002, were the first defending champions to play qualifying matches.|$|E
40|$|In {{a modern}} {{computing}} curriculum, large project courses {{are essential to}} give students hands-on experience of working in a realistic software engineering project. Assessing such projects is, however, extremely challenging. There are various aspects and tradeoffs of assessments that can affect the course quality. Individual assessments can give fair grading of individuals, but may loose focus of the project as a group activity. Extensive teacher involvement is necessary for objective assessment, but may affect the way students are working. Continuous feedback to students can enhance learning, but {{may be hard to}} combine with fair assessment. Most previous work is focusing on some specific assessment aspect, whereas we in this paper present an assessment model that consists of a collection of assessment activities, each covering different aspects. We have applied, developed, and improved these activities during a seven-year period. To evaluate the usefulness of the model, we perform questionnaire-based surveys <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>two-years</b> <b>period.</b> Furthermore, we design and execute an experiment that studies to what extent students can perform fair peer assessment and to what degree the assessments of students and teachers agree. We analyze the results, discuss findings, and summarize lessons learned...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates whether global {{imbalance}} {{in the size}} of the exchange rates order flow introduces asymmetric linkages. In particular, we study the high frequency volatility spillover between DEM/USD and GBP/USD using multivariate GARCH models <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>two-year</b> sample <b>period</b> of 1997 to 1998. The results show significant volatility spillover effects from DEM/USD to GBP/USD, while the feedback from the GBP/USD to DEM/USD is relatively small. We hypothesize that the different sizes of global order flow generated by these two exchange rates may be a major factor that contributes to such asymmetric linkages...|$|R

New writers on the album include Mimoza Blinsson, Alfred Tuohey, Nina Peifer, Max Persson, and Salar Gorgees. Some of the production was aided by writers on the album like Alfred Tuohey and Andres Ballinas.|$|R
5|$|In Italian service, Beograd and Ljubljana were repaired, re-armed, and renamed Sebenico and Lubiana respectively. Sebenico was {{commissioned}} into the Royal Italian Navy in August 1941, and Lubiana in October or November 1942. They both served mainly as convoy escorts between Italy and the Aegean and North Africa, with Sebenico completing more than 100 convoy escort missions <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>two-year</b> <b>period.</b> Neither ship {{was involved in}} any notable action. On 1 April 1943, Lubiana was either sunk off the Tunisian coast by British aircraft, or ran aground in the Gulf of Tunis and was lost. Sebenico was captured by the Germans in Venice after the Italian Armistice in September 1943 in a damaged condition. She was repaired, re-armed, and renamed TA43 and entered service in the Kriegsmarine (German Navy). TA43 served on escort and mine-laying duties in the northern Adriatic Sea, but saw little action. She was either damaged by artillery fire on 30 April 1945 at Trieste then scuttled, or just scuttled on 1 May.|$|E

40|$|Thanks {{to their}} large angular {{dimension}} and brightness, red giants and supergiants are privi-leged targets for optical long-baseline interferometers. Sixteen red giants and supergiants {{have been observed}} with the VLTI/AMBER facility <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>two-years</b> <b>period,</b> at medium spectral resolution (R = 1500) in the K band. The limb-darkened angular diameters are derived from fits of stellar atmospheric models on the visibility and the triple product data. The angular di-ameters do not show any significant temporal variation, except for one target: TX Psc, which shows a variation of 4 % using visibility data. For the eight targets previously measured by Long-Baseline Interferometry (LBI) in the same spectral range, the difference between our diameters and the literature values is less than 5 %, except for TX Psc, which shows a differ-ence of 11 %. For the 8 other targets, the present angular diameters are the first measured from LBI. Angular diameters are then used to determine several fundamental stellar parameters, and to locate these targets in the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD). Except for the enig-matic Tc-poor low-mass carbon star W Ori, the location of Tc-rich stars in the HRD matches remarkably well the thermally-pulsating AGB, as it is predicted by the stellar-evolution mod...|$|R
