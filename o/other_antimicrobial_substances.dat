40|$|Bacterial protein {{synthesis}} {{starts with a}} formylated methionine residue, and this residue is sequentially cleaved away by a unique peptide deformylase (PDF) and a methionine aminopeptidase to generate mature proteins. The formylation-deformylation of proteins is a unique hallmark of bacterial metabolism and has recently become an attractive target {{for the development of}} antimicrobial agents. The innate immune system uses the formylation of bacterial proteins as a target, and professional phagocytes, e. g., neutrophils, express specific receptors for bacterium-derived formylated peptides. Activation of formyl peptide receptors (FPR) mediates neutrophil migration and the release of oxygen radicals and <b>other</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substances</b> from these cells. We hypothesize that the use of a PDF inhibitor would increase the production of proinflammatory peptides from the bacteria and thus trigger a more pronounced innate immune response. We tested this hypothesis by exposing Escherichia coli to subinhibitory doses of the PDF inhibitor actinonin and show that actinonin indeed increases the production and secretion of neutrophil-activating peptides that activate human neutrophils through FPR. These findings could be potentially used as a new approach to antibacterial chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to propose a more accurate and faster MTT [3 -(4, 5 -dimethyl thiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] colorimetric assay (MCA) for quantitative measurement of polypeptide bacteriocins in solutions with nisin as an example. After an initial incubation of nisin and indicator bacterium Micrococcus luteus NCIB 8166 in tubes, MTT was added for another incubation period. After that, nisin was quantified by estimating the number of viable bacteria based on measuring the amount of purple formazan produced by cleavage of yellow tetrazolium salt MTT. Then MCA was compared to a standard agar diffusion assay (ADA). The results suggested a high correlation coefficient (r 					 2 = 0. 975 ± 0. 004) between optical density (OD) and the inhibitory effect of nisin on a bacterial strain Micrococcus luteus NCIB 8166 at a range of 0. 125 ~ 32 IU/ml. The MCA described in this study was very quick. Quantification of nisin took only 7 ~ 8 h and the detection limit was at the level of 0. 125 IU/ml when compared to 12 IU/ml and 24 ~ 28 h for ADA. The MCA provides an accurate and rapid method for quantification of nisin in solutions and is expected to be used for quantification of <b>other</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substances...</b>|$|E
40|$|The food chain, {{especially}} raw minced meat, {{is thought}} to be responsible for an increase in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in human nosocomial infections. Therefore, 555 samples from 115 batches of minced beef and pork from a European Union-licensed meat-processing plant were screened for the occurrence of VRE. The processed meat came from 45 different slaughterhouses in Germany. Enterococci were isolated directly from Enterococcosel selective agar plates and also from Enterococcosel selective agar plates supplemented with 32 mg of vancomycin per liter. In addition, peptone broth was used in a preenrichment procedure, and samples were subsequently plated onto Enterococcosel agar containing vancomycin. To determine resistance, 209 isolates from 275 samples were tested with the glycopeptides vancomycin, teicoplanin, and avoparcin and 19 <b>other</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substances</b> by using a broth microdilution test. When the direct method was used, VRE were found in 3 of 555 samples (0. 5 %) at a concentration of 1. 0 log CFU/g of minced meat. When the preenrichment procedure was used, 8 % of the samples were VRE positive. Our findings indicate that there is a low incidence of VRE in minced meat in Germany. In addition, the resistance patterns of the VRE isolates obtained were different from the resistance patterns of clinical isolates. A connection between the occurrence of VRE in minced meat and nosocomial infections could not be demonstrated on the basis of our findings...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Infection {{caused by}} dermatophytic fungi in man and animals is common {{throughout}} the world. Dermatophytoses poses a serious {{concern to the}} economically poor population of India. Fungi cause both superficial and internal mycoses. The mycoses, though normally not lethal, is unpleasant and difficult to cure and cause considerable economic loss. Majority of superficial infections are caused by a closely related group of keratinophilic fungi called dermatophytes, which cause ringworm infection or Tinea infection. Present study was aimed to develop an antibiotics produced by (Streptomyces spp) against dermatophytic fungi. A total of 25 soil samples {{were used for the}} isolation of soil borne actinomycetes. They were subjected to primary screening by cross streak plate assay method against dermatophytic fungi. Then they were subjected to secondary screening by cross streak plate assay method to further test the capabilities of primarily screened organisms.

40|$|Verticillium wilt {{caused by}} Verticillium spp. results in severe yield losses {{in a broad}} range of crops. Verticillium {{outbreaks}} are challenging to control, and exacerbated by increases in soil temperatures and drought associated with global warming. Employing natural antagonists as biocontrol agents offers a promising approach to addressing this challenge. Paenibacillus polymyxa Sb 3 - 1 was proven to reduce the growth of Verticillium longisporum during in vitro experiments and was shown to promote the growth of oilseed rape seedlings infested with V. longisporum. Our novel approach combined in vitro and in planta methods with the study of the mode of interaction between Sb 3 - 1 and V. longisporum EVL 43 via their volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Volatile and soluble substances, produced by both microorganisms as a reaction to one another's VOCs, were detected by using both gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. P. polymyxa Sb 3 - 1 continually produced antimicrobial and plant growth promoting VOCs, such as 2 -nonanone and 3 -hydroxy- 2 -butanone. Several <b>other</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> volatile <b>substances,</b> such as isoamyl acetate and durenol, were downregulated. The general metabolic activity of Sb 3 - 1, including protein and DNA biotransformations, was upregulated upon contact with EVL 43 VOCs. V. longisporum increased its production of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substances,</b> such as 1 -butanol, and downregulated its metabolic activities upon exposure to Sb 3 - 1 VOCs. Additionally, several stress response substances such as arabitol and protein breakdown products (e. g., L-Isoleucyl-L-glutamic acid), were increased in the co-incubated samples. The results obtained depict an ongoing dialog between these microorganisms resulting in growth inhibition, the slowing down of metabolism, and the cell death of V. longisporum due to contact with the P. polymyxa Sb 3 - 1 VOCs. Moreover, the results indicate that VOCs make a substantial contribution to the interaction between pathogens and their natural antagonists and have the potential to control pathogens in a novel, environmentally friendly manner...|$|R

40|$|Staphylococcus {{epidermidis}} {{have become}} important causes of nosocomial infections, as its pathogenesis is {{correlated with the}} ability to form biofilms on polymeric surfaces. Production of poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG) is crucial for S. epidermidis biofilm formation and is synthesized by the gene products of the icaADBC gene cluster. Production of PNAG/polysaccharide intercellular adhesin and biofilm formation are regulated by the alternative sigma factor, σB, and is influenced by a variety of environmental conditions including disinfectants and <b>other</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substances.</b> The susceptibility of five S. epidermidis strains to antibiotics alone and in double combination was previously tested. Our results demonstrated that some combinations are active and present a general broad spectrum against S. epidermidis biofilms, namely rifampicin–clindamycin and rifampicin–gentamicin. In the present study, it was investigated whether the combination of rifampicin with clindamycin and gentamicin and these antibiotics alone influence the expression of specific genes (icaA and rsbU) of S. epidermidis within biofilms using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The data showed that in most cases the expression of both genes tested significantly increased after exposure to antimicrobial agents alone and in combination. Besides having a similar antimicrobial effect, rifampicin combined with clindamycin and gentamicin induced a lower expression of biofilm-related genes relatively to rifampicin alone. Associated with the advantage of combinatorial therapy in avoiding the emergence of antibiotic resistance, this study demonstrated that it can also cause a lower genetic expression of icaA and rsbU genes, which are responsible for PNAG/polysaccharide intercellular adhesin production, and consequently reduce biofilm formation recidivism, relatively to rifampicin alone...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} lactic acid {{on the outer}} {{membrane}} permeability of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was studied utilizing a fluorescent-probe uptake assay and sensitization to bacteriolysis. For control purposes, similar assays were performed with EDTA (a permeabilizer acting by chelation) and with hydrochloric acid, the latter at pH values corresponding to those yielded by lactic acid, {{and also in the}} presence of KCN. Already 5 mM (pH 4. 0) lactic acid caused prominent permeabilization in each species, the effect in the fluorescence assay being stronger than that of EDTA or HCl. Similar results were obtained in the presence of KCN, except for P. aeruginosa, for which an increase in the effect of HCl was observed in the presence of KCN. The permeabilization by lactic and hydrochloric acid was partly abolished by MgCl 2. Lactic acid sensitized E. coli and serovar Typhimurium to the lytic action of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) more efficiently than did HCl, whereas both acids sensitized P. aeruginosa to SDS and to Triton X- 100. P. aeruginosa was effectively sensitized to lysozyme by lactic acid and by HCl. Considerable proportions of lipopolysaccharide were liberated from serovar Typhimurium by these acids; analysis of liberated material by electrophoresis and by fatty acid analysis showed that lactic acid was more active than EDTA or HCl in liberating lipopolysaccharide from the outer membrane. Thus, lactic acid, in addition to its antimicrobial property due to the lowering of the pH, also functions as a permeabilizer of the gram-negative bacterial outer membrane and may act as a potentiator of the effects of <b>other</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substances...</b>|$|E
40|$|In this study, bacteriocins {{produced}} by Lactococcus lactis strains isolated from naturally fermented sausage in Brazil were purified and identified. PCR product sequencing {{confirmed that the}} structural bacteriocin genes of the all strains are identical to lantibiotic nisin Z. Plasmids were detected in all strains of L. lactis, and {{it was observed that}} cured derivatives from all strains were able to produce bacteriocins, indicating that the genes encoding the bacteriocin are located on the chromosome. Bacteriocins were purified to homogeneity from culture supernatants by ionic exchange and reversed-phase chromatography and their molecular masses were confirmed by MALDI-TOF/TOF. The production of the bacteriocin was investigated under different growth conditions. For all of the strains, bacteriocin production appeared to parallel cell growth and reached its maximal activity at the stationary phase. All strains produced bacteriocin efficiently at initial pH values of 6. 0 and 6. 5, under aerobic conditions and at 25 °C and 30 °C in LAPTg medium. Tryptone and casein peptone were found to be the optimal organic nitrogen source for the bacteriocin production for all strains. Carbon source appears to be a major control mechanism for nisin Z production. Sucrose was the most efficient carbon source for bacteriocin production of L. lactis ID 1. 5, ID 8. 5, PR 3. 1 and PD 4. 7, while fructose was the most efficient carbon source for strain L. lactis ID 3. 1. The strains presented different activity values of bacteriocins, maximal activity was recorded by L. lactis ID 1. 5 and ID 8. 5. The nisZ and nisF promoter sequences obtained from all strains are identical, suggesting that there should be other factors involved in difference of production of bacteriocins among those strains. In addition, two cellbound antimicrobial compounds, of low molecular weight, {{produced by}} L. lactis ID 1. 5 were purified and partially characterized. After purification by cationic exchange, solid phase C 18 column and three runs of reversed-phase chromatography, antimicrobial activity was recovered with 60 % and 100 % 2 -propanol, suggesting that more than one antimicrobial compound, called in this study AI and AII, were produced by L. lactis ID 1. 5. Compond AI has a spectrum of antimicrobial activity mainly against L. lactis, including its producer strain. L. lactis LMGT 2122, Bacillus subtilis DSMZ 347, Listeria innocua BL 86 / 26 B, Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR 4 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa seem to be the organisms most sensitive to compound AII. The antimicrobial activity of both compounds was drastically reduced by treatment with tween 80, but it was present after heat and proteases treatments. These compounds show distinct properties from <b>other</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substances</b> produced by L. lactis, and have a significant inhibitory effect against clinically important respiratory pathogens. Neste trabalho, as bacteriocinas produzidas por culturas de Lactococcus lactis isoladas de salame fermentado naturalmente no Brasil foram purificadas e identificadas. O sequenciamento dos produtos amplificados por PCR comfirmou que os genes estruturais das bacteriocinas em todas as culturas de L. lactis são idênticos ao do lantibiótico nisin Z. Plasmídeos foram detectados em todas as culturas de L. lactis e foi observado que culturas curadas foram capazes de produzir bacteriocinas, indicando que os genes relacionados à produção da bacteriocina estão localizados no cromossomo. As bacteriocinas foram purificadas utilizando precipitação das proteínas com sulfato de amônio, cromatografias de troca iônica e de fase reversa, e suas massas moleculares foram confirmadas por MALDI-TOF-TOF. A produção da bacteriocina foi investigada sob diferentes condições de crescimento. Em todas as culturas, a produção de bacteriocina foi paralela ao crescimento celular e alcançou atividade máxima na fase estacionária. Todas as culturas apresentaram produção máxima de bacteriocinas em valores de pH 6. 0 e 6. 5, em condições de aerobiose e em temperaturas de 25 °C e 30 °C, em meio LAPTg. Triptona e peptona de caseína foram as melhores fontes de nitrogênio para produção das bacteriocinas em todas as culturas. A fonte de carbono foi um dos principais fatores que influenciou a produção de nisin Z. Sacarose foi a fonte de carbono mais eficiente na produção de bacteriocinas pelas culturas de L. lactis ID 1. 5, ID 8. 5, PR 3. 1 e PD 4. 7, enquanto a frutose foi a fonte de carbono mais eficiente para L. lactis ID 3. 1. As culturas apresentaram valores de atividades de bacteriocina diferentes, sendo as máximas atividades observadas nas culturas de L. lactis ID 1. 5 e ID 8. 5. As sequências dos promotores nisZ e nisF obtidas de todas as culturas foram idênticas entre si, contudo outros fatores podem estar envolvidos nas diferenças da produção das bacteriocinas entre as culturas. Além disso, dois compostos antimicrobianos, de baixo peso molecular, produzidos por L. lactis ID 1. 5, denominados neste estudo AI e AII, foram purificados e parcialmente caracterizados. O composto AI apresentou um espectro antimicrobiano principalmente contra culturas de L. lactis, incluindo a própria cultura produtora.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2002. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Fungi are an {{extremely}} {{diverse group of}} organisms and, by acting as pathogens, they can colonise various other organisms, including humans, plants and animals. The effect of this is usually detrimental, not only to agricultural crops and livestock, but also to human well-being. The extensive farming of crops and livestock requires persistent control of fungal populations, commonly {{through the use of}} chemical fungicides. However, the exclusive use of fungicides is no longer a sustainable practice, as a result of serious problems, such as increasing fungicide resistance in pathogen strains, the high costs of fungicides, as well as concern about the environment. The search by producers and scientists for alternative control measures is an ongoing process. The fungal cell wall consists of polysaccharides that not only playa role in protection of the fungi, but also in relaying signals for the invasion and infection of susceptible hosts. Chitin, a polysaccharide composed of N-acteylglucosamine (GleNAc) residues linked by P- 1, 4 glucosidic linkages, {{is one of the major}} components of the fungal cell wall, where it plays an important role in the apical growth of the vegetative hyphae. Chitinases (EC 3. 2. 1. 14) are abundant proteins produced by a variety of microorganisms and plants and are necessary for the hydrolysis of the chitin polymer. During the invasion of many plant species by a pathogen, the production of a specific group of proteins, designated pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins that include chitinases, is induced as part of their defence response. Due to the facts that pathogenic fungi contain chitin in their cell walls and that plant chitinases are induced upon pathogen attack, chitinases have been confirmed as an integral and crucial part of the plant's natural defence response. Chitinases have increasingly been targeted to upregulate plants' endogenous disease resistance mechanisms through transgenic overexpression in a variety of hosts. Several species of fungi, including various Trichoderma spp., are potent biocontrol agents of plant pathogenic fungi and insects. The antagonistic activities of these biological control agents towards phytopathogens are based on the secretion of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes, such as cell wall-degrading chitinase enzymes. However, biological control is not restricted to naturally occurring biocontrol agents. Through the process of genetic transformation, other fungal or yeast species can be enhanced to produce their own chitinases or <b>other</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substances</b> more effectively in order to yield potent biocontrol agents. Various types of chitinases have been applied in the production of fungal resistant plants and some research has been done on the application of chitinases, from a variety of microorganisms, as biological control agents. In contrast, very little is known about the antifungal activity of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae chitinase enzyme, encoded by the CTS 1 - 2 gene. The CTS 1 - 2 gene was utilised in this study as a candidate for overexpression in both yeast and plant expression systems to analyse the ability of the encoding chitinase to inhibit fungal growth. The first objective of this study involved the high level expression and optimisation of the secretion of the CTS 1 - 2 gene in S. cerevisiae to render recombinant yeast with enhanced antifungal abilities and with possible applications as a biocontrol agent to control plant pathogenic fungi. It was hypothesised that high-level expression and efficient secretion would be prerequisites in a biocontrol yeast strain. To this end, two strong promoters and terminators were included in the study and the secretion of the chitinase gene was evaluated by testing three different secretion signals. The secretion signals included: the native CTS 1 - 2 secretion signal, the S. cerevisiae mating pheromone a-factor (MFa 1) secretion signal, as well as the Trichoderma reesei f 3 -xylanase 2 (XYN 2) secretion signal. The phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK 1) and alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (ADH 2) promoters and terminators were employed to achieve high-level expression. The results obtained from the analysis of the recombinant yeasts showed that the PGK 1 promoter-terminator constructs yielded high level CTS 1 - 2 -expressing and chitinase-producing strains of S. cerevisiae PRY 488. The ability of the different secretion signals to efficiently secrete the overexpressed chitinase was analysed and it was found that the non-native secretion signals delivered significantly more protein to the extracellular environment. It was thus evident that the performance of the MFa 1 and XYN 2 secretion signals was superior to that of the native secretion signal. The antifungal activities of the recombinant chitinases produced by these constructs were tested in in vitro assays against Botrytis cinerea. The enzymes led to a significant reduction in hyphal development, caused by extreme structural damage to the hyphal tips, the hyphal cell walls as well as the ability of the fungus to form reproductive and survival structures, thereby confirming the antifungal abilities of this enzyme. The ADH 2 promoter-terminator constructs yielded CTS 1 - 2 transcripts, but no chitinase activity could be detected with any of these strains. The reasons for this still remain unclear. The second objective of this study was to assess the potential of the yeast chitinase gene to upregulate defence against fungal infection in planta. In order to elucidate this, the CTS 1 - 2 gene was constitutively overexpressed in tobacco plants, targeting the chitinase both to the intra- and the extracellular environment. The results obtained showed that the transgenic tobacco lines regenerated in this study stably integrated the transgene, exhibiting transgene expression as well as the production of a biologically active yeast chitinase enzyme. The F, progeny were rigorously tested for resistance to B. cinerea, and both in vitro and in planta assays confirmed that the yeast chitinase increased the plant's tolerance to fungal infection; some of the lines showed disease resistance of 65 and 70 %. The plants expressing an extracellularly targeted chitinase gene are still under evaluation. Interesting results are expected relating to the effect of the chitinase on the plant surface with regards to disease resistance to fungal pathogens. In conclusion, the combined set of results from both the yeast and plant overexpression studies has confirmed the strong antifungal effect of yeast chitinases. The yeast CTS 1 - 2 chitinase could be instrumental in the development of a new generation of yeast strains with improved antifungal capabilities. This enzyme could also play an important role in genetic transformation technologies aimed at enhanced disease resistance. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Swamme omsluit 'n uiterste diverse groep organismes wat mense, plante en diere deur patogeniese aksie kan koloniseer. Die uitkoms hiervan op landbougewasse, die veebedryf en menslike gesondheid is gewoonlik skadelik. Uitgebreide gewas- en veeboerderye benodig voortdurende beheer van fungiese populasies, tipies deur van chemiese swamdoders gebruik te maak. Die uitsluitlike gebruik van swamdoders is egter nie meer 'n lewensvatbare praktyk nie, hoofsaaklik as gevolg van probleme soos die opbou van weerstand van patogeniese rasse teen swamdoders, die hoë kostes van die middels, asook besorgheid oor die omgewing. Die soektog na alternatiewe beheermaatreëls deur produsente en wetenskaplikes bly 'n aaneenlopende proses. Die swamselwand bestaan uit polisakkariede wat nie net In rol in die beskerming van die swam speel nie, maar ook betrokke is in die oordrag van aanvals- en infeksieverwante seine in 'n vatbare gasheer. Chitien, 'n polisakkaried bestaande uit N-asetielglukosamien (GlcNAc) residu's gekoppel deur 13 - 1, 4 glukosidiese bindings, is een van die hoofkomponente van die swamselwand, waar dit 'n belangrike rol in die apikale groei van vegetatiewe hifes speel. Chitinases (EC 3. 2. 1. 14) is proteïene wat oorvloedig deur 'n verskeidenheid van mikroërganismes en plante geproduseer word, waar hulle vir die hidrolise van die chitien polimeer noodsaaklik is. Tydens die infeksie van verskeie plantspesies deur In patogeen, word die produksie van 'n spesifieke groep proteïene, die sogenaamde patogeen-verwante (PR) proteïene wat chitinases insluit, as deel van die plant se verdedigingsreaksie geïnduseer. Die feit dat patogeniese swamselwande chitien bevat en dat plantchitinases tydens infeksie geïnduseer word, het daartoe gelei dat dit bevestig is dat chitinases In integrale en kritiese deel van die plant se natuurlike verdedigingsreaksie uitmaak. Chitinases word toenemend geteiken in pogings om die plant se intrinsieke siekteweerstandsmeganismes te verbeter deur transgeniese ooruitdrukking daarvan in 'n verskeidenheid van gashere. Verskeie swamspesies, insluitend verskillende Trichodenna-spesies, is kragtige bio-antagoniste van plantpatogeniese swamme. Die antagonistiese aksies van hierdie biologiese beheeragente teenoor fitopatogene is gebaseer op die uitskeiding van ekstrasellulêre hidrolitiese ensieme, soos die selwandverterende chitinase ensieme. Nietemin is biologiese beheer nie net tot bio-antagoniste wat natuurlik voorkom beperk nie. Deur die proses van genetiese transformasie kan ander swam- of gisspesies verbeter word om hul eie chitinases of ander antimikrobiese substanse meer effektief te produseer, wat aanleiding sal gee tot kragtige bio-antagoniste. Verskeie tipes chitinases is al in die produksie van swambestande plante ingespan en uitgebreide navorsing is gedoen op die toepassing van 'n reeks chitinases, afkomstig van 'n verskeidenheid van mikroërganismes, as biologiese beheeragente. In teenstelling is baie min bekend oor die antifungiese aktiwiteite van die Saccharomyces cerevisiae chitinase ensiem, wat deur die CTS 1 - 2 geen ge-enkodeer word. Die CTS 1 - 2 -geen is in hierdie studie gebruik vir ooruitdrukking in beide gis- en plantuitdrukkingsisteme om die chitinase se vermoë om swamgroei te inhibeer, te ondersoek. Die eerste oorkoepelende oogmerk van hierdie studie het hoë-vlak uitdrukking en optimalisering van sekresie van die CTS 1 - 2 -geen in S. cerevisiae behels, met die toekomstige doelwit om 'n rekombinante gis met verbeterde antifungiese eienskappe en met moontlike toepassings as 'n bio-antagonis teen plantpatogeniese swamme te ontwikkel. Die hipotese was dat hoë-vlak uitdrukking en voldoende sekresie voorvereistes vir 'n bio-antagonisras is. Omdié rede is twee sterk promotors en termineerders by hierdie studie ingesluit en is die sekresie van die chitinase-geen geëvalueer deur drie verskillende sekresieseine te toets. Die sekresieseine sluit in: die wilde-tipe CTS 1 - 2 sekresiesein, die S. cerevisiae paringsferomoon a-faktor (MFa 1) sekresiesein, en die Trichoderma reesei p-xilanase (XYN 2) sekresiesein. Die fosfogliseraat kinase 1 (PGK 1) en alkohol dehidrogenase 2 (ADH 2) promotors en termineerders is gebruik om hoë-vlak uitdrukking te dryf. Die resultate wat vanaf die analises van die rekombinante giste verkry is, het getoon dat die PGK 1 promotor-termineerder konstrukte hoë-vlak CTS 1 - 2 -uitdrukkende en chitinase-produserende S. cerevisiae PRY 488 rasse opgelewer het. Die vermoë van die verskillende sekresieseine om die ooruitgedrukte chitinase voldoende uit te skei, is geanaliseer, en daar is gevind dat die heteroloë sekresieseine aansienlik meer proteïene na die ekstrasellulêre omgewing geloods het. Dit was dus duidelik dat die MFa 1 en XYN 2 sekresieseine beter as die wilde-tipe sekresiesein presteer het. Die antifungiese aktiwiteit van die rekombinante chitinases wat deur hierdie konstrukte geproduseer is, is ook in in vitrotoetse teen Botryits cinerea getoets. Die teenwoordigheid van die ensieme het gelei tot 'n aansienlike afname in hife-ontwikkeling, veroorsaak deur ekstreme strukturele skade aan die hifepunte, die hifeselwande, asook die vermoë van die swam om voortplanting- en oorlewingstrukture te vorm. Die ADH 2 promotor-termineerderkonstrukte het CTS 1 - 2 transkripte vertoon, maar geen chitinase-aktiwiteite kon in hierdie konstrukte waargeneem word nie. Die redes hiervoor is tot op hede onbekend. Die tweede oogmerk van hierdie studie was om die potensiaal van die gischitinase om swaminfeksie in planta teë te werk, te ondersoek. Die CTS 1 - 2 -geen is konstitutief ooruitgedruk in tabakplante, waarin die chitinase na beide die intra- en ekstrasellulêre omgewing geteiken is. Resultate het getoon dat die geregenereerde transgeniese tabaklyne die transgeen stabiel geïntegreer het, transgeenuitdrukking vertoon en dat 'n biologies aktiewe chitinase-ensiem geproduseer is. 'n F 1 -generasie is aan strawwe toetse onderwerp om weerstand teen B. cinerea te ondersoek.
