25|$|Screech owls or screech-owls {{are typical}} <b>owls</b> (<b>Strigidae)</b> {{belonging}} to the genus Megascops. Twenty-one living species are known at present, but new ones are frequently recognized and unknown ones are still being discovered on a regular basis, especially in the Andes. For most of the 20th century, this genus was merged with the Old World scops owls in Otus, but nowadays it is again considered separate based {{on a range of}} behavioral, biogeographical, morphological and DNA sequence data.|$|R
5000|$|In some birds - many true <b>owls</b> (<b>Strigidae),</b> some nightjars (Caprimulgidae) {{and a few}} cuckoos (Cuculus and relatives) being {{widely known}} {{examples}} - there is colour polymorphism. This means that two or more colour variants are numerous within their populations during all or at least most seasons and plumages; in the above-mentioned examples a brown (phaeomelanin) and grey (eumelanin) morph exist, termed [...] "hepatic form" [...] particularly in the cuckoos. Other cases of natural polymorphism are of various kinds; many are melanic/nonmelanic (some paradise-flycatchers, Terpsiphone, for example), but more unusual types of polymorphism exist - the face colour of the Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae) or the courtship types of male ruffs (Philomachus pugnax).|$|R
5000|$|Some 220 to 225 extant {{species of}} owls are known, {{subdivided}} into two families: typical <b>owls</b> (<b>Strigidae)</b> and barn-owls (Tytonidae). Some entirely extinct families {{have also been}} erected based on fossil remains; these differ much from modern owls in being less specialized or specialized {{in a very different}} way (such as the terrestrial Sophiornithidae). The Paleocene genera Berruornis and Ogygoptynx show that owls were already present as a distinct lineage some 60-57 million years ago (Mya), hence, possibly also some 5 million years earlier, at the extinction of the nonavian dinosaurs. This makes them one of the oldest known groups of non-Galloanserae landbirds. The supposed [...] "Cretaceous owls" [...] Bradycneme and Heptasteornis are apparently nonavialan maniraptors.|$|R
50|$|Blakiston's fish owl (Bubo blakistoni), {{the largest}} living species of owl, is a fish owl, a {{sub-group}} of eagle owls {{who specialized in}} hunting riparian areas. This species {{is a part of}} the family known as typical <b>owls</b> (<b>Strigidae)</b> which contains most species of owl. Blakiston's fish owl and three related species were previously placed in the genus Ketupa; mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data is equivocal on which genus name is applied for this species. Its habitat is riparian forest, with large, old trees for nest-sites, near lakes, rivers, springs and shoals that don't freeze in winter. Henry Seebohm named this bird after the English naturalist Thomas Blakiston, who collected the original specimen in Hakodate on Hokkaidō, Japan in 1883.|$|R
2500|$|During hibernation, predators of Indiana bats {{may include}} black rat snakes (Pantherophis obsoletus) [...] and {{northern}} raccoons (Procyon lotor). During other {{times of the}} year northern raccoons have been observed trying to grab bats from the air when they attempt to fly away. Skunks (Mephitidae), Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), and feral cats (Felis catus) may pose a similar threat. If Indiana bats fly from their day roosts during the day, they may be susceptible to predation by hawks (Accipitridae). Indiana bats foraging at night may also be susceptible to predation by <b>owls</b> (<b>Strigidae).</b> While not a predator, woodpeckers (Picidae) may disturb roosting bats through their foraging activities by peeling away sections of bark being utilized by Indiana bats, causing Indiana bats to fly from the roost during the day and making the tree unsuitable for future habitation.|$|R
40|$|Numerous avian taxa use torpor, which {{involves}} pronounced reductions in body temperature (Tb) to below normothermic levels. However, {{the occurrence of}} this phenomenon in <b>owls</b> (<b>Strigidae)</b> remains largely unknown. We investigated winter patterns of thermoregulation in the crepuscular 80 -g pearlspotted owlet Glaucidium perlatum and the strictly nocturnal 61 -g African scops-owl Otus senegalensis by obtaining telemetric measurements of skin temperature (Tskin) from free-ranging individuals in the Kalahari Desert of southern Africa. Pearlspotted owlets remained homeothermic throughout the study period, whereas African scops-owls routinely used shallow torpor, with Tskin reduced by 3. 3 – 8. 6 C (pooled mean, 5. 3 1. 1 C) below normothermic levels for 3 – 4 h after sunrise. The mean lowest Tskin recorded in three African scops-owl individuals was 29. 0 0. 1 C. The thermoregulatory differences between these two species {{may be related to}} their diets and activity patterns. African scops-owls are almost exclusively insectivorous and experience a marked reduction in food availability on cold winter nights. In contrast, pearl-spotted owlets have more flexible activity patterns and include larger or diurnal vertebrate prey in their diet...|$|R

40|$|Linear {{measurements}} and derived indices from striated trypanosomas in nine species of sub-Saharan birds representing seven {{families of the}} Passeriformes, were compared. The dimensions of the striated trypomastigotes from the Carduelinae, Estrildidae, Nectarinidae, Passeridae, Pycnonotidae, Turdinae and Zosteropidae were similar {{to each other as}} well as to those of the striated trypanosomes from the boreal <b>owl</b> (<b>Strigidae).</b> All these trypanosomes were considered to be Trypanosoma avium Danilewsky, 1885. A further 20 avian species were considered to harbour T. avium, thus greatly extending the reported host range of this trypanosome. Non-striated trypanosomes from the estrildid Uraeginthus angolensis closely resembled Trypanosoma bouffardi Leger & Blanchard, 1911 in appearance and dimensions, and were considered to be of this species. Additional host records for T. bouffardi from an additional nine avian species have been reported. The uniquely small and stumpy Trypanosoma everetti Molyneux, 1973 was reported from an additional 18 avian species. A large non-striated trypanosome from the laughing dove, Streptopelia senegalensis, was identified as Trypanosoma hannae Pittaluga, 1905 and this species was re-described. An infection of this parasite was also found in a single Streptopelia capicola and a single Streptopelia semitorquata.

40|$|A high, {{approximately}} constant normothermic {{body temperature}} {{is associated with}} elevated maintenance energetic requirements. However, many small endotherms offset the energetic demands of thermoregulation through heterothermy (e. g., daily torpor and hibernation) and/or phenotypic adjustments in maintenance metabolic requirements. In terms of their significance in energy conservation, there are limited data on the above mentioned physiological responses in birds, compared to mammals. Torpor appears to be common in species that rely on unpredictable food resources. However, {{to better understand the}} adaptive value and evolution of avian torpor, {{a better understanding of the}} phylogenetic distribution of this trait is needed. The first aim of this dissertation was to investigate the occurrence of torpor in free-ranging Pearl-spotted Owlets (Glaucidium perlatum) and African Scops-Owls (Otus senegalensis). Although heterothermic responses have been recorded in a number of avian taxa, the occurrence of this phenomenon in <b>owls</b> <b>owls</b> (<b>Strigidae)</b> remains unknown. I investigated winter patterns of thermoregulation in the crepuscular 80 -g Pearlspotted Owlet and the strictly nocturnal 61 -g African Scops-Owl by obtaining telemetric measurements of skin temperature (Tskin) from free-ranging individuals in the Kalahari Desert of southern Africa. Pearl-spotted Owlets remained normothermic (Tskin > 37 °C) throughout the study period, whereas African Scops-Owls routinely used shallow torpor, with Tskin reduced by 3 ° to 9 °C below normothermic levels for 1. 5 to 5 h after sunrise. The mean lowest Tskin in three African Scops-Owl individuals was 29. 0 ° ± 0. 1 °C. The reductions in Tskin in African Scops-Owls are, to the best of my knowledge, the most pronounced Tskin reductions yet observed in owls. The thermoregulatory differences between these two species may be related to their diets and activity patterns. African Scops-Owls are almost exclusively insectivorous and experience a marked reduction in food availability on cold winter nights, and are therefore likely to undergo energy stress. In contrast, Pearl-spotted Owlets have more flexible activity patterns and include larger and/or diurnal vertebrate prey in their diet, which is a more reliable food resource. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence that birds can adjust their minimum maintenance metabolic requirements (i. e. basal metabolic rate, BMR) over short time scales in response to changing environmental conditions. However, there has been very little emphasis on the role of metabolic adjustments at reducing energy requirements in birds. Reductions in BMR would facilitate greatest energy savings during winter when increased thermoregulatory demands coincide with low food availability. The second aim of this dissertation was to investigate seasonal adjustments in basal metabolic rate of birds resident year round in the Kalahari Desert of southern Africa. Our current understanding on the role of these adjustments is largely limited to small birds inhabiting cold temperate regions in the northern Hemisphere, where winter BMR is typically elevated. I measured winter and summer BMR in the field for five species resident in the Kalahari Desert of southern Africa, using a portable respirometry system. I found that winter BMR was generally lower than in summer. Mass-specific BMR was significantly lower in winter in the nocturnal African Scops-Owl (Otus senegalensis; 23...|$|R

40|$|Background: Many {{species of}} <b>owls</b> (<b>Strigidae)</b> {{represent}} cryptic species and their taxonomic study is in flux. In recent years, two {{new species of}} owls of the genus Strix have been described from the Middle East by different research teams. It {{has been suggested that}} one of these species, S. omanensis, is not a valid species but taxonomic comparisons have been hampered by the lack of voucher specimens of S. omanensis, and the poor state of the holotype of S. butleri. Methods: Here we use new DNA sequence data to clarify the taxonomy and nomenclature of the S. butleri complex. We also report the capture of a single S. butleri sensu stricto in Mashhad, Iran. Results: A cytochrome b sequence of S. omanensis was found to be identical to that of the holotype of S. butleri, indicating that the name S. omanensis is best regarded as a junior synonym of S. butleri. The identity of the S. butleri captured in Mashhad, Iran, was confirmed using DNA sequence data. This represents a major (1300 km) range extension of this species. Conclusions: The population discovered in Oman in 2013 and originally named 'S. omanensis' actually represents the rediscovery of S. butleri, which was known from a single specimen and had not been recorded since 1878. The range of S. butleri extends into northeast Iran. Our study augments the body of evidence for the recognition of S. butleri and S. hadorami as separate species and highlights the importance of using multiple evidence to study cryptic owl species...|$|R
