5|$|Cho <b>offered</b> <b>some</b> of the {{earliest}} contributions to Kim Il-sung's cult of personality. His most famous work is Mt. Paektu (1947), a lyrical epic praising Kim Il-sung's guerrilla activities and promoting him as a suitable leader for the new North Korean state. Other notable works by Cho include , a seemingly non-political love poem which was later adapted as a popular song that is known in both North and South Korea.|$|E
5|$|Enderlin {{responded to}} Leconte and Jeambar in January 2005 in Le Figaro. He thanked them for rejecting that the scene had been staged. He had {{reported}} that the shots were fired by the Israelis because, he wrote, he trusted the cameraman, {{who had worked for}} France 2 since 1988. In the days following the shooting, other witnesses, including other journalists, <b>offered</b> <b>some</b> confirmation, he said. He added that the Israeli army had not responded to France 2's offers to cooperate with their investigation.|$|E
5|$|Like the Stimson Doctrine, Welles' {{declaration}} {{was largely}} symbolic in nature, although it <b>offered</b> <b>some</b> material benefits {{in conjunction with}} Executive Order 8484. It enabled the diplomatic representatives of the Baltic states in various other countries to fund their operations and protected the ownership of ships flying Baltic flags. By establishing a non-recognition policy, it allowed some 120,000 postwar displaced persons from the Baltic states to avoid repatriation to the Soviet Union and advocate independence from abroad.|$|E

5|$|The University of Manitoba is {{the largest}} {{university}} in Manitoba. It was founded in 1877, making it Western Canada's first university. In a typical year, the university has an enrolment of 24,500 undergraduate students and 4,000 graduate students. Université de Saint-Boniface is the city's only French Canadian university. The University of Winnipeg received its charter in 1967. Until 2007, it was an undergraduate institution that <b>offered</b> <b>some</b> joint graduate studies programs; it now offers independent graduate programs. The Canadian Mennonite University is a private Mennonite undergraduate university established in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, {{developments}} in chemotherapy <b>offered</b> <b>some</b> hope for Ruth. The doctors {{had not told}} Ruth that he had cancer because of his family's fear that he might do himself harm. They treated him with teropterin, a folic acid derivative; {{he may have been}} the first human subject. Ruth showed dramatic improvement during the summer of 1947, so much so that his case was presented by his doctors at a scientific meeting, without using his name. He was able to travel around the country, doing promotional work for the Ford Motor Company on American Legion Baseball. He appeared again at another day in his honor at Yankee Stadium in September, but was not well enough to pitch in an old-timers game as he had hoped.|$|E
5|$|During his career, Han {{survived a}} number of purges that were caused by {{factional}} strife within the Workers' Party. Han, motivated by personal grievances against his rival writers, sometimes acted as the force behind the purges within the cultural establishment as well. Han himself was purged in 1962. In his works, Han <b>offered</b> <b>some</b> of the earliest known contributions to the cult of personality of Kim Il-sung. His influence is felt in North Korea even today, though his name has been forgotten from official histories. Han's best known work, the anti-American novella Jackals, however, has been invoked in the 2000s.|$|E

5|$|In {{the third}} decade of her reign, {{influenced}} by her Jewish courtier Abraham Mendel Theben, Maria Theresa issued edicts which <b>offered</b> <b>some</b> state protection to her Jewish subjects. Her actions {{during the late}} stages of her reign contrast her early opinions. She forbade the forcible conversion of Jewish children to Christianity in 1762, and in 1763 she forbade Catholic clergy from extracting surplice fees from her Jewish subjects. In 1764, she ordered the release of those Jews who had been jailed for a blood libel {{in the village of}} Orkuta. Notwithstanding her strong dislike of Jews, Maria Theresa supported Jewish commercial and industrial activity in Austria.|$|E
5|$|Sputnik 2 was not {{designed}} to be retrievable, and Laika had always been intended to die. The mission sparked a debate across the globe on the mistreatment of animals and animal testing in general to advance science. In the United Kingdom, the National Canine Defence League called on all dog owners to observe a minute's silence, while the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) received protests even before Radio Moscow had finished announcing the launch. Animal rights groups at the time called on {{members of the public}} to protest at Soviet embassies. Others demonstrated outside the United Nations in New York; nevertheless, laboratory researchers in the U.S. <b>offered</b> <b>some</b> support for the Soviets, at least before the news of Laika's death.|$|E

5|$|With an {{internal}} conflict, a destroyed economy, and a weakened army, Skanderbeg {{realized that he}} needed to make an alliance with a powerful state so that the League would continue its existence. He first approached the Republic of Venice by offering a military alliance and a sort of vassalhood to the Republic of Venice, but the Republic was then enjoying good relations with the Ottomans and thus refused Skanderbeg's offer. Rome <b>offered</b> <b>some</b> monetary help, but Skanderbeg was looking for more. Skanderbeg then turned to Alfonso V of Aragon who then controlled Naples and Sicily. Alfonso wanted to expand his empire from Gibraltar to the Bosphorus. In order to realize his dreams, he would need a bridgehead in the Balkans from where he could march to Constantinople. Alfonso thus took up the offer to establish diplomatic relations with Skanderbeg and his Albanian allies.|$|E
5|$|You Don't Know Jack was {{developed}} by Chicago-based company Jellyvision. The You Don't Know Jack (YDKJ) series, though popular in the 1990s during the rise of gaming on personal computers, had not had an official full release since 1998 with You Don't Know Jack: The Ride. Though Jellyvision <b>offered</b> <b>some</b> web-based You Don't Know Jack games in the interim years, the developers left the gaming market after seeing the rise of home gaming consoles in the early 2000s. Though they had considered adapting the game for consoles, and had produced two titles for the original PlayStation, they could only realize You Don't Know Jack games with players at the same keyboard for input. During this time, Jellyvision reinvented itself as Jellyvision Labs, offering its services in business-to-business communication including for tax software from H Block and interviews for Equifax.|$|E
5|$|Above ground, American and Vietnamese {{soldiers}} who had escaped death or capture tried {{to escape from the}} North Vietnamese. From the team house, a group of four Americans and about 50 CIDG soldiers held a quick conference and decided that they would leave the camp through the northern perimeter, where there was no visible sign of the North Vietnamese. Without much difficulty, the Americans and the CIDG soldiers were able {{to make it through the}} barbed-wire barrier, but North Vietnamese soldiers on the eastern side of the camp had detected their movement and began firing on the group. Ultimately, only two Americans and about 10 Vietnamese soldiers managed to escape from the camp, taking refuge in a dry creek bed that <b>offered</b> <b>some</b> cover and concealment. At around 03:30am, Willoughby made another request for the Marines at Khe Sanh to send reinforcements, but again his request was turned down. In an attempt to save the defenders at Lang Vei, Company C Headquarters in Da Nang tried to call for reinforcements from the Marines at Khe Sanh, but its request was also turned down. Finally, Company C Headquarters placed another Mobile Strike Force Company and a company-sized unit on standby alert in Da Nang, to be airlifted into battle as soon as helicopters were available.|$|E

5|$|As Stanton and Ranft {{discussed}} the adaptation, they rattled off scenarios and storylines springing from their premise. Lasseter {{liked the idea}} and <b>offered</b> <b>some</b> suggestions. The concept simmered until early-1995, when the story team began work on the second film in earnest. During an early test screening for Toy Story in San Rafael in June 1995, they pitched the film to Disney CEO Michael Eisner. Eisner thought the idea was fine and they submitted a treatment to Disney in early-July under the title Bugs. Disney approved the treatment and gave notice on July 7 that it was exercising the option of a second film under the original 1991 agreement between Disney and Pixar. Lasseter assigned the co-director job to Stanton; both worked well together and had similar sensibilities. Lasseter had realized that working on a computer-animated feature as a sole-director was dangerous while the production of Toy Story was in process. In addition, Lasseter believed that it would relieve stress and that the role would groom Stanton for having his own position as a lead director.|$|E
5|$|Braham and Walsh {{scrambled}} {{free of the}} Mosquito and {{hid behind}} a sand dune. As they did so the aircraft's fuel tanks exploded. The Fw 190 pilot flew over at 20 feet {{and for a moment}} they believed he was going to fire upon them. To their relief he waved and flew by. They contemplated escape but instantly German soldiers were running towards them. They had crash-landed near to a radar station and the enemy soldiers were at the crash site very quickly. The Germans fired a few shots in their direction but none hit them. They were captured and searched. The Germans found a Mauser pistol which Braham had taken from a crashed German bomber. It was not well received by his captors. Braham believed they might attack him and he had thought about grabbing the gun, fighting it out with the German guards, finding a friendly Dane and making it to Sweden somehow. The tension eased when he was taken to a barracks and <b>offered</b> <b>some</b> synthetic German coffee. Soon a pair of Luftwaffe officers arrived and escorted him to a cell on an airfield near Esjberg.|$|E
5|$|In season 3, Sophie {{was mostly}} only {{mentioned}} in the starting episodes of the third season. She was a frequent babysitter, often left with Flower' pups, Buster, Izzy and Suggs, along with Mitch and Jogu. When the Whiskers moved territories, Izzy fell behind and {{was expected to be}} killed by an eagle owl, but Sophie rescued the pup. Later, Sophie once again came to Izzy's aid and <b>offered</b> <b>some</b> food. When the babysitters (Sophie, Mitch and Jogu) and the pups were separated from the Whiskers, Mitch, being the oldest, left to find the main group to try and reunite them with the pups. Soon after a Zappa female named Maryline visited the burrow looking for her family. Following his hormones, Jogu went off after the evicted female, leaving Sophie to watch Flower's pups by herself. When the rival gang, the Zappa, attacked, Sophie took the pups below ground. But before the Zappa reached the burrow, the Whiskers arrived and chased them off. After these events, Sophie was seldom mentioned again throughout the season. At one point in the third season, she was played by Finn because Tina Sparkle was evicted.|$|E

5|$|The Crédit Mobilier of America scandal {{involved}} {{corruption in}} the financing of the Union Pacific Railroad, part of the transcontinental railroad that was completed in 1869. Union Pacific officers and directors secretly purchased control of the Crédit Mobilier of America company, then contracted with the firm to have it undertake {{the construction of the}} railroad. The grossly inflated invoices submitted by the company were paid by the railroad, using federal funds appropriated to subsidize the project, and the company was allowed to purchase Union Pacific securities at par value, well below the market rate. Crédit Mobilier showed large profits and stock gains, and distributed substantial dividends. The high expenses meant that Congress was called upon to appropriate more funds. One of the railroad officials who controlled Crédit Mobilier was also a congressman, Oakes Ames of Massachusetts. He <b>offered</b> <b>some</b> of his colleagues the opportunity to buy Crédit Mobilier stock at par value, well below what it sold for on the market, and the railroad got its additional appropriations.|$|E
5|$|The {{prominence}} of a Brahmin in Indian society was {{directly related to}} his virtues, values, knowledge and practice of the scriptures. Manu's list of virtues of a perfect Brahmin, according to Italian Jesuit Roberto de Nobili, in order of importance were righteousness, truthfulness, generosity, almsgiving, compassion, self-restraint and diligent work. Prior {{to the rise of}} the Konkanastha Peshwas, the Konkanastha Brahmins were considered inferior in a society where the Deshasthas held socio-economic, ritual and Brahminical superiority. As mentioned earlier, all the Pant Pradhan during Shivaji's rule were Deshastha Brahmins and many modern families who have surname, Peshwe, are in fact Deshastha Brahmins tracing descent to Shivaji's Pant Pradhans, Moropant Pingle or Sonopant Dabir. After the appointment of Balaji Vishwanath Bhat as Peshwa, Konkanastha migrants began arriving en masse from the Konkan to Pune, where the Peshwa <b>offered</b> <b>some</b> important offices to the Konkanastha caste. The Konkanastha kin were rewarded with tax relief and grants of land. Historians point out nepotism and corruption during this time.|$|E
