Iz peshcher i debrei Indostana: pis'ma na rodinu) is a {{literary}} {{work by the}} founder of the Theosophical Society Helena Blavatsky. She published it under the pen name Radda Bai in serial installments (letters) from 1879 to 1886 in Moscow in the periodicals Moskovskiya Vedomosti and Russkiy Vestnik, edited by Mikhail Katkov. The first part of these letters was published in a single volume in 1883 as an appendix to the journal Russkiy Vestnik. The second part of the letters was published in 1884–1886. The series <b>obviously</b> <b>was</b> never finished as it broke off rather suddenly.|$|E

25|$|Greece had to {{wait for}} the EuroBasket 2001 in order to make its {{comeback}} to the international scene. The team <b>obviously</b> <b>was</b> {{in the middle of a}} transition period, during which young stars Theo Papaloukas, Antonis Fotsis, and Lazaros Papadopoulos were unable to build a highly competitive team right away. Alvertis, coming off a great year with Panathinaikos, and Giorgos Sigalas, had to show to the young generation the road to success. The first game against Italy, the reigning champion, proved that Alvertis was ready to fulfill his role. A buzzer-beating three pointer gave Greece a very impressive 83–82 win. The team, however, had not reached the level of a medal contender yet. The 105–82 loss against Russia in the next game confirmed that. Consequently, in order to reach the quarter finals, Greece's game against rising power Germany appeared to be a difficult task. After leading the game by 22, the Greek team actually collapsed against superstar Dirk Nowitzki and his teammates, giving Germany an 80–75 win. Alvertis averaged 16 points in the tournament, but Greece ended up in ninth place. It was his last opportunity to reach success with the national team as its leader, especially since Greece had not qualified for the 2002 FIBA World Championship. The transition period for the young generation was soon going to be over.|$|E

2500|$|Cuvier's {{claim that}} new fossil forms appear {{abruptly}} in the geological record and then continue without alteration in overlying strata {{was used by}} later critics of evolution to support creationism, to whom the abruptness seemed consistent with special divine creation (although Cuvier's finding that different types made their paleontological debuts in different geological strata clearly did not).

[...] Built in 1902 and inspired by the {{building on}} 10 Skeppsbron (possibly by Nicodemus Tessin the Younger), it featured shops on street level, flanked by pilasters topped by volutes, offices on the second floor behind the low rounded arches and the bar windows, with dwellings above and storage below. [...] Originally, the entrance was flanked by two minor doors facing the street (the door still is still there), and was slightly more elaborated. [...] The green colour of the building would have pleased neither of the two architects, but <b>obviously</b> <b>was</b> to the taste of today's catering business, judging from the restaurant residing there - Pontus in the Green House.|$|E
2500|$|Chuck Jones, Pepé's creator, {{wrote that}} Pepé was based (loosely) on the {{personality}} of his Termite Terrace colleague, writer Tedd Pierce, a self-styled [...] "ladies' man" [...] who reportedly always assumed that his infatuations were reciprocated. [...] Pepé's voice, provided by Mel Blanc, was based on Charles Boyer's Pépé le Moko from Algiers (1938), a remake of the 1937 French film Pépé le Moko. Eddie Selzer, animation producer—and Jones' bitterest foe—at Warners then once profanely commented {{that no one would}} laugh at those cartoons. [...] However, this did not keep Selzer from accepting an award for one of Pepé's pictures several years later. There have been theories that Pepé was based on Maurice Chevalier. However, in the short film, Chuck Jones: Memories of Childhood, Jones says Pepé was actually based on himself, but that he was very shy with girls, and Pepé <b>obviously</b> <b>was</b> not. A prototype Pepé appears in 1947's Bugs Bunny Rides Again, but sounds similar to Porky Pig.|$|E

Jimi Hendrix could play the guitar like crazy, but Chris had the song-writing chops that we all sort of hoped to get to {{at different points in}} our songwriting careers. He had a way he could wrap a melody around odd time signatures and weird parts and make them catchy. He was a beautiful wordsmith. If you look at his lyrics, he <b>obviously</b> <b>was</b> processing his pain and depression, and all of those things. I think that’s part of what people, myself included, responded to when he was singing. With the songwriting he had that voice, there’s not too many people that have that many options with their voice. He could do {{a lot of different things}} with it, and have a lot of different characters in that voice. I feel so lucky that I got to be in a project with him, got to hang out with him, and just sort of witness his greatness." ...|$|E

[...] When an attorney for Tom Cruise read reports that Morton had obtained letters asserting Cruise had a homosexual affair while filming Eyes Wide Shut, he commented on a November 2005 letter he had written to Morton: [...] "I {{wrote a letter to}} Mr. Morton back in November and said he <b>obviously</b> <b>was</b> entitled to write the book but 'make sure you check your facts'. If he tries to use my letter to create the impression that Mr. Cruise did have a gay affair, we will certainly sue … because the story is false. Mr. Cruise is not gay." [...] In an interview with InTouch Weekly, Cruise's attorney Bertram Fields commented on the book: [...] "To the extent that Mr. Morton's book sticks to the truth, it can't 'ruin' or 'harm' Tom … My guess is this book will be dull except for those parts that are lies." [...] Cruise's publicist also stated that the book will consist of fabricated lies.|$|E
2500|$|The 1958 Canadian general {{election}} {{was a disaster}} for the CCF, with its caucus reduced to eight, and its leader M. J. Coldwell losing his own seat, the party executive knew that their party was dying and needed radical change. Coldwell was persuaded by the party's executive to remain as the party's leader. But the party also needed a leader in the House of Commons to replace him, because he <b>obviously</b> <b>was</b> no longer a member of parliament. The CCF parliamentary caucus chose Hazen Argue as its new leader in the House. During the lead-up to the 1960 CCF convention, Argue was pressing Coldwell to step down. [...] This leadership challenge jeopardized plans for an orderly transition to the new party that was being planned by the CCF and the Canadian Labour Congress. [...] CCF national president David Lewis – who succeeded Coldwell as president in 1958, when the national chairman and national president positions were merged – {{and the rest of the}} new party's organizers, opposed Argue's manoeuvres, and wanted Douglas to be the new party's first leader. To prevent their plans from derailing, Lewis attempted to persuade Argue not to force a vote at the convention on the question of the party's leadership. He was unsuccessful. There was a split between the parliamentary caucus and the party executive on the convention floor. Coldwell stepped down as leader, and Argue replaced him, becoming the party's final national leader.|$|E
2500|$|Pforzheim is {{situated}} in a valley and also spread out across the adjacent hill slopes. On the northern slope there is a level, narrow plateau that is about 100meters wide and about 2kilometers in length. The railway facilities, including the main station and {{what used to be}} the freight loading facilities, are located on this plateau. This is the only level space that can possibly be used for railway facilities there. If the RAF would have been only aiming at destroying the railway facilities, a few aircraft would have sufficed to finish this job in a short time. There was no need to bomb an area that was wider than one kilometer (...) and had a length of more than three kilometers (...) using more than 360 Lancasters, as was the case in the big raid on 23 February. The existence and size of the plateau on the northern slope can be verified by examining any topographic map featuring the Pforzheim city area, and the map showing the destroyed city area. (refer to References Map of destroyed town area). And besides that, the area bombardment <b>obviously</b> <b>was</b> not even effective in destroying the railway facilities, because less than one month after the big raid in mid-March the railway facilities were bombed again several times by the USAF, this time focussing mainly on the suspected military target, not civilian estates (refer to References Pforzheimer Zeitung of 4 March 2005).|$|E

2500|$|The {{last major}} {{thing that would}} happen with the Soviet Science Academy would be a {{struggle}} to allow more Western ideas into the Physics Department. This <b>obviously</b> <b>was</b> in response to America having nuclear weapons and the Soviet Union realizing they needed {{to catch up with}} them. An article would be published by Vladimir Fock through the Soviet Science academy criticizing the theories of Einstein because he was a Western scientist. [...] However, this propagandist work was found to have shoddy science behind it and the entire department upon inspection was found to be less productive {{than the rest of the}} Science Academy. The more realistic scientific work written by Moisey Alexandrovich Markov which agreed with Western theories would receive more support. So in the beginning, with people like Aleksandrov in the philosophy department there was the idea that people should not bring up Western ideology even to criticize it and explain why Communism is better but now there is a turnaround where because beating the West is what matters good science needs to take place even if it means talking about ideas that go against principles to do so. This is because the philosophy of the West had been more important to defeat than proper research methods until the concerns about nuclear war emerged. They would decide to fire more of the department and hire more competent people because of the increased importance of nuclear research. The need for physicists would protect Jewish people from the xenophobic wrath of Stalin and Beria but not everyone would be spared for these reasons. [...] Still many scientists would be protected by the institute because they were seen as important to the success of the country. The Soviet Science Academy would help to play their part in the goal of the Soviet Union to surpass the military might of the United States through the use of physics and chemistry research.|$|E
2500|$|At this First Council of Nicaea twenty-two bishops, led by Eusebius of Nicomedia, came as {{supporters}} of Arius. But {{when some of}} Arius's writings were read aloud, they are reported to have been denounced as blasphemous by most participants. Those who upheld the notion that Christ was co-eternal and con-substantial with the Father were led by the priest Alexander. Athanasius {{was not allowed to}} sit in on the Council since he was only an arch-deacon. [...] But Athanasius is seen as doing the legwork and concluded (as Bishop Alexander conveyed in the Athanasian Trinitarian defense and also according to the Nicene Creed adopted at this Council and,) that the Son was of the same essence (homoousios) with the Father (or one in essence with the Father), and was eternally generated from that essence of the Father. Those who instead insisted that the Son of God came after God the Father in time and substance, were led by Arius the presbyter. For about two months, the two sides argued and debated, with each appealing to Scripture to justify their respective positions. Arius argued for the supremacy of God the Father, and maintained that the Son of God was simply the oldest and most beloved Creature of God, made from nothing, because of being the direct offspring. [...] Arius taught that the pre-existent Son was God's First Production (the very first thing that God actually ever did in His entire eternal existence up to that point), before all ages. [...] Thus he insisted that only God the Father had no beginning, and that the Father alone was infinite and eternal. [...] Arius maintained that the Son had a beginning. And he argued that everything else was created through the Son. [...] Thus, said Arius, only the Son was directly created and begotten of God; furthermore, there was a time that He had no existence. [...] He was capable of His own free will, said Arius, and thus [...] "were He in the truest sense a son, He must have come after the Father, therefore the time <b>obviously</b> <b>was</b> when He was not, and hence He was a finite being." [...] Arius appealed to Scripture, quoting verses such as : [...] "the Father is greater than I". And also : [...] "the firstborn of all creation." [...] Thus, Arius insisted that the Father's Divinity was greater than the Son's, and that the Son was under God the Father, and not co-equal or co-eternal with Him.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{received}} extensive negative reviews at {{the time}} of its release and by modern film historians. Variety was particularly negative. Calling the movie [...] "derivative", the industry trade publication said, [...] "Summarizing the plot of Beginning of the End is like rehashing the story of several dozen similar films." [...] The publication felt that not much effort had been put into the film. [...] "Even taken on its own terms—as a low-budget exploitation feature—Beginning of the End hardly reflects the best effort of a major theatre circuit." [...] It called the special effects [...] "obvious" [...] and decried the use of stock footage. The reviewer felt the screenplay was [...] "ludicrous" [...] and cliché-ridden. The magazine believed Peter Graves had turned in a decent performance, but described Peggie Castle's performance as [...] "unconvincing" [...] and Morris Ankrum's as [...] "artificial". The cinematography and editing were, it concluded, average. Mae Tinnee, reviewing the motion picture for the Chicago Tribune had several negative comments. [...] "The film <b>obviously</b> <b>was</b> made on a shoestring budget, and the people in it are no more than props for the magnified insects. I doubt if it will fool anyone. But youngsters will probably think it's great stuff." [...] The Los Angeles Times was far harsher in its assessment. Its unsigned review concluded: [...] "The audience is cheated in the production. The conclusion is never in doubt and the process shots are so obvious that one is startled the first time a buffalo-sized grasshopper hits the screen but never again. And at no time are there more than a half-dozen of the things shown at once, although the script avers that there are thousands about and more coming." [...] As of 2008, Beginning of the End is still [...] "one of the most excoriated creature features." [...] Leonard Maltin summed up his review in one word: [...] "awful". Another recent film guide called it [...] "Bottom-of-the-sci-fi-barrel rubbish, very boring to watch." [...] One review pointed out that Gordon didn't even bother to hide the mountains in the background of the shots (Central Illinois is mostly flat prairie land). Some have also been upset with film's lack of horrifying images. The derivative nature of the picture has also upset some critics. Critics say the film covered almost the same ground as the far superior monster movie Them!, and it is clear that Gordon merely wanted to [...] "cash in" [...] on giant bug craze rather than come up with a story that was fresh and creative.|$|E
