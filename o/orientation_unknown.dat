40|$|The central {{research}} {{question of the}} current study had to do with self - an stereotypically- gendered identities of lesbians. The purpose was to determine the nature and form of gender identity and gender stereotypes among women who self-identify as lesbians, and more specifically, {{to determine whether or not}} “gender” means the same to lesbians as it does to heterosexual women. Identity measures were Bern’s (1974) Sex-role Inventory (BSRI) and a butch-femme rating scale. The sample consisted of 65 women who self-identified as lesbian. The lesbians in the current sample did identify more strongly with masculine attributes (Masculinity scale mean = 5. 27) than with feminine attributes (Femininity scale means= 5. 07). Interestingly, the current sample’s mean Masculinity scores were higher than those of women (heterosexual <b>orientation</b> <b>unknown,</b> and lesbians) in prior research. The majority of butches and femmes identified as masculine and feminine, respectively. As indicated from prior research subjects, and even more strongly among the lesbians in this study, traits such as “cheerful,” “shy,” “flatterable,” “childlike,” “does not use harsh language,” and “lives children” may no longer be self-descriptions of lesbians or heterosexual women. The lesbians in this study described themselves as assertive and independent and also as nurturant and sensitive. It may be that the terms like “agency” and “emphatic” will in the future be more useful than the dichotomized masculine and feminine labels...|$|E

40|$|Nanofabrication {{techniques}} {{were used to}} manufacture nanometer scale protein templates. The fabrication approach employs electron beam lithography (EBL) patterning on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) thiol (CH 3 O(CH 2 CH 2 O) 17 NHCO(CH 2) 2 SH) self-assembled monolayers (SAM) on Au. The PEG SAM prevented protein surface adhesion and binding sites for protein were created in the SAM by EBL. Subsequent to EBL, the patterns in the PEG SAM were backfilled with 40 -nm NeutrAvidin-coated fluorescent spheres (FluoSpheres). The spontaneous and directed immobilization of the spheres from {{a solution to the}} patterns resulted in high resolution protein patterns. The FluoSpheres could be arranged in any arbitrary pattern with ultimately only one or a few FluoSpheres at each binding site. Growth dynamics and SAM morphology of PEG on Au were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). PEG SAMs on three types of Au with different microstructure were examined: thermally evaporated granular Au and two types of Au films produced by hydrogen flame annealing of granular Au, Au(111) and "terraced" Au (crystal <b>orientation</b> <b>unknown).</b> The different Au surfaces' substructure affected the morphology and mechanical properties of the PEG SAM. On Au(111), AFM imaging revealed monolayer formation through three distinct steps: island nucleation, island growth, and coalescence. The fine-structure of the SAM revealed dendritic island formation - an observation which can be explained by attractive intermolecular interactions and diffusion-limited aggregation. Island growth was not observed on the "terraced" Au. AFM studies of EBL patterned PEG SAMs on Au(111) revealed two different patterning mechanisms. At low doses, the pattern formation occurs by SAM ablation in a self-developing process where the feature depth is directly dose dependent. At higher doses electron beam induced deposition of material, so-called contamination writing, is seen in the ablated areas of the SAM. The balance between these two mechanisms is shown to depend on the geometry of the pattern. In addition to PEG SAMs, fibronectin monolayers on SiO 2 surfaces were patterned by EBL. The areas exposed with EBL lose their functionality and do not bind anti-fibronectin. With this approach we constructed fibronectin templates and used them for cell studies demonstrating pattern dependent cell geometries and cell adhesion. QC 2010100...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} clustering a set of high-dimensional data points into sets of low-dimensional linear subspaces. The number of subspaces, their dimensions, and their <b>orientations</b> are <b>unknown.</b> We propose a simple and low-complexity clustering algorithm based on thresholding {{the correlations between the}} data points followed by spectral clustering. A probabilistic performance analysis shows that this algorithm succeeds even when the subspaces intersect, and when the dimensions of the subspaces scale (up to a log-factor) linearly in the ambient dimension. Moreover, we prove that the algorithm also succeeds for data points that are subject to erasures with the number of erasures scaling (up to a log-factor) linearly in the ambient dimension. Finally, we propose a simple scheme that provably detects outliers. Comment: ICASSP 201...|$|R

The proposed calibration approach for this sensor combination differs from the traditional stereo camera calibration in two fundamental ways.

A second distinction is that their resolution is typically very low, which requires special attention. We assume {{a situation in which}} the sensors’ relative position is known, but their <b>orientation</b> is <b>unknown.</b> In addition, some of the typical measurement errors are discussed, and methods to compensate for them are proposed.

Figure 9 shows that ‘weighted’ estimators, W-LS and W-Stansfield, achieve good performance (close to the CRB for W-Stansfield), while standard estimators are strongly suboptimal and provide nearly constant RMSE for all values of m and M. The best trade-off is located at values of M lower {{than in the previous}} scenarios: [m[*]=[*] 6, M[*]=[*] 6] for Stansfield and CRB, and [m[*]=[*] 9,M[*]=[*] 4] for LS, i.e., one step less than in the other cases (Figures 7 and 8). This behavior can be explained by observing that, when each sensor has a random orientation, more ‘sensor diversity’ is necessary to achieve good performance. In terms of absolute values, the best RMSE achievable with random orientation is approximately 0.02, while it is approximately 0.008 in the case of ideal orientation. The gap is approximately 4 dB.|$|R

Proliferation of breast cancer cells directed by constrained ligands is associated with DNA binding, coactivator recruitment and activation of the estrogen-induced gene GREB 1, reflecting a highly interconnected signaling network. In contrast, proliferation driven by dynamic ligands is associated with induction of ERα-mediated transcription in a DNA-binding domain (DBD) -dependent manner. Further, dynamic ligands displayed enhanced anti-inflammatory activity. The DBD-dependent profile was predictive of these signaling patterns in a larger diverse set of natural and synthetic ligands. Thus, ligand dynamics directs unique signaling pathways, and reveals a novel role of the DBD in allosteric control of ERα-mediated signaling...|$|R
