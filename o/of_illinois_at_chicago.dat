30|$|Displays {{with large}} screen size and high {{resolution}} are increasingly becoming affordable and ubiquitous. Large displays {{are often used}} in certain niche markets such as public displays and digital signage markets. These include displays at public places such as airports, museums, hotels, stadiums, hospitals, malls. These displays are often created using individual small display tiles. Also, in universities, research institutes, and corporations, large wall-sized displays are often built from small-sized individual display panels. Such large-sized tiled displays are used for scientific, medical visualization applications [1]. Examples of such tiled displays include LambdaVision display <b>at</b> University <b>of</b> <b>Illinois</b> <b>at</b> <b>Chicago's</b> Electronic Visualization Laboratory [2], Stallion tiled display at Texas Advanced Computing Center [3], and Stanford School of Medicine tiled display [4].
