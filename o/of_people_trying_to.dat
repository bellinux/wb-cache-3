Various landmarks, such as the kiosk and the bridge, were missing, and the grounds were full <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> <b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> {{come up with an}} explanation, they {{wondered}} if they had stumbled across a private party or an event booked that day. However, they found that nothing had been booked that afternoon. During their research, they thought they recognised the man by the kiosk as the Comte de Vaudreuil, a friend of Marie Antoinette, who herself had been thought to have been seen by Moberly.|$|E
5|$|Reality TV was {{a popular}} genre of {{television}} programming in the UK in 2002. The third series of the UK version of Big Brother—which was showing while Russian's con took place—attracted audience figures of approximately 5.8million. Most British reality TV programmes at the time centred on a team <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> accomplish a specific goal or target. For example, the 2000 series Jailbreak challenged a group to escape from a mock prison, while the 2001 series The Mole gave the contestants the task of discovering which of them was sabotaging their attempts to win money. Most reality TV shows offered a cash reward to successful participants—both Jailbreak and the first series of The Mole offered a prize of £100,000.|$|E

500|$|Schwa's buzz, and customers, quickly returned. By May 2008, it was {{routine for}} the restaurant's voice mail to reach {{capacity}} {{because of the}} large number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get reservations (and the restaurant's lack of a receptionist).

Gautham surrenders to the police after [...] "killing" [...] the man, confessing that he killed three men: one in Belfast, one in Pune and one just now in Hyderabad. He is released from custody after Sameera broadcasts the video on television. According to his doctor, if Gautham can hallucinate a person other than the three men, he can be treated. Gautham goes to Goa on vacation. Sameera stalks him, convincing him that two people are stalking him: a journalist who wants to interview him (imaginary), and a person claiming to be his fan (real). Gautham begins {{to fall in love with}} Sameera.

500|$|Whedon {{developed}} the concept {{for the show}} after reading The Killer Angels, the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Michael Shaara chronicling the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War. He wanted to follow people who had fought on the losing side of a war and their experiences afterwards as pioneers and immigrants {{on the outskirts of}} civilization, much like the post-American Civil War era of Reconstruction and the American Old West culture. He intended the show to be [...] "a Stagecoach kind of drama with a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> figure out their lives in a bleak pioneer environment". Whedon wanted to develop a show about the tactile nature of life, a show where existence was more physical and more difficult. After reading The Killer Angels, Whedon read a book about Jewish partisan fighters in World War II that also influenced him. Whedon wanted to create something for television that was more character-driven and gritty than most modern science fiction. Television science fiction, he felt, had become too pristine and rarefied.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the filming}} of Amar Prem there was a scene {{that needed to be}} shot at Howrah Bridge with a boat {{carrying}} Khanna and Sharmila under the bridge. The authorities ruled this scene out as they realised that if the public found out that the star would be there, it may create problems on the bridge and that it might collapse due to the amount <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get a glimpse of their favourite actor. Film critic Monojit Lahiri remembers [...] "Girls married themselves to photographs of Rajesh Khanna, cutting their fingers and applying the blood as sindoor. Rajesh was God, there has never been such hysteria." ...|$|E

In 2013, the Jets' new quarterbacks coach, David Lee, instituted a program {{to cut down on}} the fumbles by {{teaching}} Sanchez to hold the ball with both hands. In what Lee calls [...] "The Sanchez Drill," [...] the quarterback runs a gauntlet <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> knock the ball out of his hands with foam bats. Lee explained to the press, [...] "Mark can win in this league. He has proven that. He’s played for championships. I'm blatantly honest, brutally truthful at times.

As he rides away, he looks back and sees the kobold sitting behind him. [...] "It was high time that we got out!" [...] it says. A similar tale from Köpenick tells of a man trying to move out of a kobold-infested house. He sees the kobold preparing to move too and realises that he cannot rid himself of the creature. The lord of the Hundermühlen Castle disliked Heinzelmann and tried to escape him by taking up residence with his family and retinue elsewhere. Nevertheless, the invisible kobold travelled along with them as a white feather, which they discovered when they stayed at an inn.|$|E

2500|$|In his autobiography, Buck Clayton shared {{some of his}} {{memories}} of the Dunbar. He recalled the Dunbar as “jumping” with loads <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> {{get a glimpse of}} the celebrities, and parties thrown by Duke Ellington and his guys with “chicks and champagne everywhere.” Clayton recalled an instance when Ellington and his orchestra came to Los Angeles shortly after the 1932 release of the song It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing). Ellington’s band was in the Dunbar restaurant when the song came on the jukebox. It was the first time since leaving New York that they had heard their recording. Clayton described the band's response: “So much rhythm I've never heard, as guys were beating on the tables, instrument cases or anything else they could beat on with knives, forks, rolled-up newspapers or anything else they could find to make rhythm. [...] It was absolutely crazy.” ...|$|E
2500|$|A lecture {{recorded}} at Madame Jojo's in London in September 2008 was published online by The Guardian in which W.K. addressed claims about his [...] "secret history" [...] in a tongue-in-cheek manner, making reference to various conspiracy theories which {{emerged in the}} wake of the aforementioned disputes. Apparently in response to criticism and confusion over these statements, Andrew W.K. published an article on January 3, 2010 on his official website declaring himself to be [...] "a real person who thinks for himself" [...] and [...] "not the victim of anyone or group <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> influence my career or life." [...] On February 14, at a Q event hosted by W.K. at the Santos Party House, he admitted that while legally he could not answer certain questions, he once again affirmed: [...] "I am Andrew W.K., the same that has been here from the beginning... I am... I am, I am the same Andrew W.K. at this appearance as at all Andrew W.K.-related appearances." ...|$|E
2500|$|Without much {{experience}} as a live act, Foster the People were booked in October 2010 to play several club shows [...] "to help them get their sea legs". Booking the group proved difficult, as concert promoters were hesitant about an artist without previous touring experiences. Foster the People promoted these concerts by emailing fans who had downloaded [...] "Pumped Up Kicks" [...] from their website about the shows. In early 2011, the band was booked to perform in a much sought-after tent at April's Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Meanwhile, the group continued to grow its fanbase with a month-long residency of concerts in January at The Echo nightclub in Los Angeles. According to booking agent Tom Windish, by the group's third show at the venue, [...] "there were hundreds <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get in outside.... It was an obvious turning point that could be measured in numbers." [...] The residency also drew the attention of music supervisors in attendance who would later help the group license their music.|$|E
