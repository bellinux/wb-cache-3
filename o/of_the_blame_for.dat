5|$|The Battle of Albuera {{had little}} effect on the overall course of the war, but it had shown that British and Spanish troops could work together. On the other hand, Anglo-Spanish {{political}} relations suffered following the battle. Wellington placed most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the losses on Blake, while a dispatch read in the Spanish cortes implied that the British had played only a minor role in the battle, despite their much higher losses.|$|E
5|$|The Giants regressed to a 5–11 {{record in}} 1995. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the Giants' poor {{performance}} {{was placed on}} Brown. He put up lackluster numbers {{for the second straight}} year. Though the Giants defense still played well, and young players like Michael Strahan and Jessie Armstead began to emerge,* Freeman, Mike. , The New York Times, October 30, 1995, accessed December 6, 2010. the Giants inspired tepid interest league-wide and sent no players to the Pro Bowl for the second straight year.|$|E

25|$|According to the Bible, Josiah was <b>the</b> son <b>of</b> King Amon and Jedidah, <b>the</b> {{daughter}} <b>of</b> Adaiah of Bozkath. His grandfather Manasseh was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kings <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> {{turning away}} from <b>the</b> worship <b>of</b> Yahweh. Manasseh adapted the Temple for idolatrous worship. Josiah's great-grandfather was King Hezekiah, a noted reformer.|$|R
5|$|Senior leaders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party <b>blamed</b> Dentsu <b>for</b> its {{defeat in}} the elections. They also said that Dentsu had charged too much for its services.|$|R
5|$|However, much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> {{the decay}} and ruinous state of {{preservation}} of so many palazzi must fall not just on owners unwilling to accept change, but the political agendas of successive socialist governments. Some of the finest Baroque villas and palazzi, including the Palermo palace of the Prince of Lampedusa, are still in ruins following the United States bombing raids of 1943. In many cases, no attempt {{has been made to}} restore or even secure them. Those that survived the raids in good repair are often sub-divided into offices or apartments, their Baroque interiors dismantled, divided, and sold.|$|E
5|$|With the win, Schilling became {{only the}} fifth pitcher to ever win a World Series {{game with a}} team from both leagues, having {{previously}} done it with National League teams, the Philadelphia Phillies in 1993, and the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001. He later donated the bloody sock he wore during the game to the Baseball Hall of Fame museum. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the Cardinals' losses {{in the first two}} games was directed at the fact that Rolen, Edmonds and Reggie Sanders, three of the Cardinals' best batters, had combined for one hit in 22at-bats.|$|E
5|$|Wright told Lee {{that it was}} {{relatively}} easy {{to get to the}} crest, but it was difficult to stay there. A significant reason Wright could not stay was his lack of support. Two brigades were on Wright's left and could have reinforced his success. Carnot Posey's brigade made slow progress and never crossed the Emmitsburg Road, despite protestations from Wright. William Mahone's brigade inexplicably never moved at all. Gen. Anderson sent a messenger with orders to Mahone to advance, but Mahone refused. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the failure of Wright's assault must lie with Anderson, who took little active part in directing his division in battle.|$|E
50|$|Event organisers {{confirmed}} in January 2011 {{that there would}} be no awards ceremony that year, with Meteor's cancellation of its sponsorship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event widely <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> this abrupt occurrence.|$|R
50|$|Further rioting {{took place}} in Jaffa between 1 and 7 May 1921. In October 1921, <b>the</b> Haycraft Commission <b>of</b> Inquiry laid <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Jaffa riots <b>of</b> May 1921 on the Arab community, but {{otherwise}} the report was not acted upon.|$|R

5|$|Considering its inexperience, Savige's 17thInfantry Brigade {{was given}} a {{complicated}} role in the Battle of Bardia. While the 2/6thInfantry Battalion made a demonstration on the right, the 2/5thInfantry Battalion, reinforced by part of the 2/7thInfantry Battalion, attempted to follow up the 16thInfantry Brigade's attack, with {{the remainder of the}} 2/7th in reserve. The brigade had to move in four directions at once. The plan soon went wrong, as the 2/5th in particular suffered a series of mishaps. By nightfall, Colonel Frank Berryman, the divisional chief of staff, had reached the conclusion that the 17thInfantry Brigade had become too tired and disorganised for further effort. This was only partly due to enemy action; the rest was attributable to Berryman's own plan, which had dispersed the brigade and provided it with inadequate armoured and, in the final stages, artillery support. Savige also bore some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame,</b> <b>for</b> failing to ensure that his subordinates understood and carried out the plan.|$|E
5|$|Consuls {{were each}} {{assigned}} {{two of the}} four legions to command, rarely employing all four legions at once to the same assignment. However, the Senate feared a real threat and not only deployed all four legions to the field but all eight, including allies. Ordinarily, each of the two consuls would command his own portion of the army, but since the two armies were combined into one, Roman law required them to alternate their command on a daily basis. The traditional account puts Varro in command {{on the day of the}} battle, and much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the defeat has been laid on his shoulders. However, his low origins seem to be exaggerated in the sources, and Varro may have been made a scapegoat by the aristocratic establishment. He lacked the powerful descendants that Paullus had, descendants who were willing and able to protect his reputation— most notably, Paullus was the grandfather of Scipio Aemilianus, the patron of Polybius (one of our main sources of this history).|$|E
5|$|French {{casualties}} in the engagement are uncertain due to the circumstances of Confiantes destruction, but based on Acklom's report from the boarding party they {{were believed to be}} heavy. British losses were negligible, with not one man killed or seriously wounded and only minor damage inflicted on Hydra and none on the smaller vessels. The conduct of Lieutenant Lecolier was the subject of much criticism in France after the battle; in the French history Victories et Conquêtes, Lecolier was accused of failing to support Pevrieux and grounding his ship while the outcome of the battle was still undecided. British historian William James is less critical of Lecolier, focusing much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the French defeat on the more senior Pevrieux. The restriction of French movement along their own coastline had serious effects {{for the development of the}} French forces in the region and played a significant role in the failure of the French to pose a realistic invasion threat to Britain.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>the</b> {{aftermath}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match, <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Heysel Stadium disaster {{was laid}} on the Liverpool fans. UEFA official Günter Schneider stated, [...] "Only the English fans were responsible. Of that, there is no doubt." [...] As a result, The Football Association withdrew English clubs from European competition, and two days later UEFA banned English clubs for [...] "an indeterminate period of time". A condition was added, stipulating that Liverpool would serve another three-year ban once the ban on English clubs was lifted. Fagan had decided to retire before the match; he felt the team needed rebuilding {{and he was not}} the ideal man to do this with his 64th birthday approaching. He was replaced by Dalglish, who became the club's first player-manager.|$|R
25|$|A plaque {{to their}} memory {{was raised in}} the English church in Algiers. <b>The</b> 17th-century {{historian}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Douglas family, David Hume <b>of</b> Godscroft laid <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> their loss on Robert's mother, Agnes Leslie, Countess of Morton, for her attempt in 1584 to prevent them supporting <b>the</b> Earl <b>of</b> Gowrie, which was considered misguided.|$|R
5000|$|An {{editorial}} {{appeared in}} Tanzania's The Guardian: [...] "It is unacceptable {{for the government}} and the public to rely on police investigations, knowing only too well that they are in this case one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parties being <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> our colleague." ...|$|R
5|$|McDougal was {{released}} {{at the end}} of the trial and returned home. The following day she went to buy whisky and was confronted by a mob who were angry at the not proven verdict. She was taken to a police building in nearby Fountainbridge for her own protection, but after the mob laid siege to it, she escaped through a back window to the main police station off Edinburgh's High Street. She tried to see Burke, but permission was refused; she left Edinburgh the next day, and there are no clear accounts of her later life. On 3 January 1829, on the advice of both Catholic priests and Presbyterian clergy, Burke made another confession. This was more detailed than the official one provided prior to his trial; he placed much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the murders on Hare.|$|E
25|$|On October 17, the Tigers hired Rick Knapp {{as their}} new {{pitching}} coach, replacing Chuck Hernandez, {{who took part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the team's poor pitching in 2008. Knapp had worked for 12 years as the minor league pitching coordinator for the Minnesota Twins.|$|E
25|$|By 1950, U.S. Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson had {{established}} a policy of faithfully following President Truman's defense economization plans, and had aggressively attempted to implement it {{even in the face}} of steadily increasing external threats. He consequently received much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the initial setbacks in Korea and the widespread reports of ill-equipped and inadequately trained U.S. military forces in the war's early stages.|$|E
50|$|According to a Justice Department {{report on}} BLA activity, the Black Liberation Army was {{suspected}} {{of involvement in}} over 70 incidents of violence between 1970 and 1976. <b>The</b> Fraternal Order <b>of</b> Police <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> BLA <b>for</b> <b>the</b> murders <b>of</b> 13 police officers.|$|R
50|$|Brigitta {{sends out}} her three black ravens, one each to the southwest, northwest, and northeast, with {{the hopes that}} one will not return and thus {{indicate}} <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> land. When all three return, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voyagers <b>blame</b> Olaf <b>for</b> their misfortune and threaten to take his life.|$|R
50|$|On 26 October 1943 Ida and Hugh {{were married}} at London's Guildhall Register Office, {{six days after}} Enid's {{marriage}} to Darrell Waters. In 1944 they had a daughter Rosemary Pollock, also a romance writer. Enid changed <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> their daughters and Hugh did not see them again, although Enid had promised access as part <b>of</b> his taking <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> divorce.|$|R
25|$|A joint {{committee}} of inquiry was established by the Board of Trade and the Atlantic Telegraph Company. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the cable's failure was found to rest with Whitehouse. The committee found that, though underwater cables were notorious in their lack of reliability, {{most of the problems}} arose from known and avoidable causes. Thomson was appointed one of a five-member committee to recommend a specification for a new cable. The committee reported in October 1863.|$|E
25|$|Schröder’s efforts backfired {{within his}} own Social Democratic Party though, where the {{traditional}} labor wing rejected the Schröder-Blair call for cost-cutting in the welfare state and pro-business policies. Instead, the paper took part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> a succession of six German state election losses in 1999 for Schröder's party. Only by 2000, Schröder managed {{to capitalize on the}} donations scandal of his Christian Democratic opposition to push through a landmark tax-reform bill and re-establish his dominance of the German political scene.|$|E
25|$|Churchill was {{involved}} {{with the development of}} the tank, which was financed from the Navy budget. In February 1915 he appointed the Landships Committee, which oversaw the design and production of the first British tanks. However, he {{was also one of the}} political and military engineers of the disastrous Gallipoli landings in the Dardanelles. He took much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the fiasco, and when H. H. Asquith formed an all-party coalition government in late May 1915, the Conservatives demanded his demotion as the price for entry.|$|E
5000|$|Named after a lyric in the album's opening song [...] "Pray for Plagues", Count Your Blessings is {{representative}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band's early deathcore sound, which was phased out on later releases and eventually abandoned {{in favour of}} other, less aggressive styles. Most band members recorded their parts individually, rather than the group doing so as a whole, with <b>the</b> central location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studio <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> distracting <b>the</b> young musicians. The album received some negative reviews, although it still reached <b>the</b> top 100 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UK Albums Chart.|$|R
50|$|After the People Power Revolution in 1986, Corazón Aquino, Cojuangco's estranged cousin, became {{president}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Philippines. Aquino rode on <b>the</b> crest <b>of</b> widespread public outrage over <b>the</b> assassination <b>of</b> her husband, Benigno Aquino, Jr., in 1983. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> her husband's death was Cojuangco, who fled {{on the same}} aircraft as Marcos to Hawaii in 1986. The Aquino administration sequestered Cojuangco's stake in San Miguel and agreed to let Soriano Jr.'s son, Andrés Soriano III, run the company, although the Soriano family's holdings had dwindled to a mere 1%.|$|R
2500|$|... “They <b>blame</b> us <b>for</b> their guilt. They {{say we are}} {{a privileged}} few. They say we gamble too much.” The way these lines are written reflect their meaning and {{make you feel like}} you’re being told: “they blame… they say… they say… etc.” This idea <b>of</b> {{shifting}} <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> what happened to the Indians on the Indians is common and despicable. It reflects <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colonizers giving (“gifting”) land to the Indians as though they weren’t theirs in the first place. Then they say that the Indians are so privileged, but what privileges do they have when they are constantly pre-judged for things like drinking and gambling? ...|$|R
25|$|In 1983, the Obote {{government}} launched Operation Bonanza, {{a military}} expedition that claimed {{tens of thousands}} of lives and displaced {{a significant portion of the}} population. The brunt <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> this massacre was placed on the people of northern Uganda for supporting the action of the Prime Minister which increased the existing regional tensions in the country. It has been estimated that approximately 100,000 to 500,000 people died as a result of fighting between Obote's Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA) and the guerrillas.|$|E
25|$|The honeymoon {{period with}} the Australian public, however, did not last. 2004 proved a {{disastrous}} year {{in terms of}} his tennis career and public profile. After shouldering most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> losing Australia's Davis Cup tie with Sweden with an unexpected below-par performance, Philippoussis struggled through to the Wimbledon fourth round in June 2004. From Wimbledon in June {{until the end of the}} season in October, he failed to win a single ATP tennis match and finished with one of his lowest rankings since turning professional in 1994.|$|E
25|$|The Bible's tone {{with regard}} to Saul changes {{over the course of}} the narrative, {{especially}} around the passage where David appears, midway through 1 Samuel. Before, Saul is presented in positive terms, but afterward his mode of ecstatic prophecy is suddenly described as fits of madness, his errors and disobedience to Samuel's instructions are stressed and he becomes a paranoiac. This may indicate that the David story is inserted from a source loyal to the House of David; David's lament over Saul in 2 Samuel 1 then serves an apologetic purpose, clearing David <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> Saul's death.|$|E
50|$|On 27 March 2007, <b>the</b> leader <b>of</b> Sunni Arab insurgent group 1920 Revolution Brigades was killed. An {{official}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group <b>blamed</b> AQI <b>for</b> <b>the</b> attack. The 1920 Revolution Brigades {{had been}} {{rumored to have}} taken part in secret talks with American and Iraqi officials who tried to draw Sunni groups away from AQI.|$|R
25|$|Also in 2003, a stage {{adaptation}} of Nabokov's unused screenplay {{was performed in}} Dublin adapted by Michael West. It was described by Karina Buckley (in <b>the</b> Sunday Times <b>of</b> London) as playing more like Italian commedia dell'arte than a dark drama about paedophilia. Hiroko Mikami notes that the initial sexual encounter between Lolita and Humbert was staged {{in a way that}} left this adaptation particularly open to <b>the</b> charge <b>of</b> placing <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> initiating <b>the</b> relationship on Lolita and normalizing child sexual abuse; however, Mikami challenged this reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> production, noting that <b>the</b> ultimate devastation <b>of</b> events on Lolita's life is duly noted in the play.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{practice}} <b>of</b> <b>blaming</b> <b>the</b> Jews <b>for</b> Jesus' {{death is}} <b>the</b> longest example <b>of</b> collective responsibility. In this case, <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> was cast {{not only on}} <b>the</b> Jews <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time but upon successive generations. This comes from Matthew 27:25-66 New International Version (NIV) 25: [...] "All the people answered, 'His blood is on us and on our children!'" ...|$|R
