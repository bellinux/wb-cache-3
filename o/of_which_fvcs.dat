In order to clarify this clinical problem, {{changes in the}} forced vital capacity {{of a group of}} children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who had undergone spinal surgery were measured and compared with a group of children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who had not had surgery. METHODS [...] In this retrospective study 17 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who underwent spinal stabilisation at a mean age of 14. 9 years (surgical group) were compared with 21 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who had not had surgery (non-surgical group). The mean (SD) Cobb angle of the surgical group at 14. 9 years was 57 (16. 4) degrees, and of the non-surgical group at 15 years was 45 (29. 9) degrees. Forced vital capacity expressed as percentage predicted (% FVC) was measured in total over a seven year period in the surgical group and over 6. 5 years in the non-surgical group, and regression equations were calculated. Survival curves for both groups were also constructed. RESULTS [...] No difference was found between spinal stabilisation (surgical group) and the non-surgical group in the rate of deterioration <b>of</b> % <b>FVC</b> <b>which</b> was 3 - 5 % per year. There was no difference in survival in either group.

40|$|This {{study is}} a pilot {{research}} that explores {{the effectiveness of a}} likelihood ratio (LR) -based forensic voice comparison (FVC) system built on non-native speech production. More spe-cifically, it looks at native Hong Kong Can-tonese-speaking male productions of English vowels, and the extent to <b>which</b> <b>FVC</b> can work on these speakers. 15 speakers partici-pated in the research, involving two non-contemporaneous recording sessions with six predetermined target words – “hello”, “bye”, “left”, “right”, “yes”, and “no”. Formant fre-quency values were measured from the trajec-tories of the vowels and surrounding segments. These trajectories were modelled using discrete cosine transforms for each for-mant (F 1, F 2 and F 3), and the coefficient val-ues were used as feature vectors in the LR calculations. LRs were calculated using the multivariate-kernel-density method. The re-sults are reported along two metrics of per-formance, namely the log-likelihood-ratio cost and 95 % credible intervals. The six best-performing word-specific outputs are present-ed and compared. We find that FVC can be built using L 2 speech production, and the re-sults are comparable to similar systems built on native speech. ...|$|R

50|$|Spirometry {{measures}} {{the amount of}} airflow obstruction present and is generally carried out after {{the use of a}} bronchodilator, a medication to open up the airways. Two main components are measured to make the diagnosis: the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in the first second of a breath, and the forced vital capacity (<b>FVC),</b> <b>which</b> is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in a single large breath. Normally, 75-80% of the FVC comes out in the first second and a FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 70% in someone with symptoms of COPD defines a person as having the disease. Based on these measurements, spirometry would lead to over-diagnosis of COPD in the elderly. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence criteria additionally require a FEV1 of less than 80% of predicted.|$|R

People with COPD also exhibit a decrease in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) due to decreased surface area in the alveoli, as well as damage to the capillary bed.|$|R
40|$|By {{studying}} {{the behavior of}} programs in the SPECint 95 suite we observed that six out of eight programs exhibit {{a new kind of}} value locality, the frequent value locality, according to which a few values appear very frequently in memory locations and are therefore involved in a large fraction of memory accesses. In these six programs ten distinct values occupy over 50 % of all memory locations and on an average account for nearly 50 % of all memory accesses during program execution. This observation holds for smaller blocks of consecutive memory locations and the set of frequent values remains quite stable over the execution of the program. In the six benchmarks with frequent value locality, on an average 50 % of all cache misses occur during the reading or writing of the ten most frequently accessed values. We propose a new data cache structure, the frequent value cache (<b>FVC),</b> <b>which</b> employs a value-centric approach to caching data locations for exploiting the frequent value locality phen [...] ...|$|R
