2500|$|March 26, 2005. Response by Les Roberts et al. to Apfelroth. Acknowledges flaws, {{but says}} [...] "the key public-health {{findings}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>are</b> robust despite this imprecision. These findings include: a higher death rate after the invasion; a 58-fold increase in death from violence, {{making it the}} main cause of death; and most violent deaths being caused by air-strikes from Coalition Forces. Whether the true death toll is 90000 or 150000, these three findings give ample guidance towards understanding what must happen to reduce civilian deaths.... Before publication, the article was critically reviewed by many leading authorities in statistics and public health and their suggestions were incorporated into the paper. The death toll estimated by our study is indeed imprecise, and those interested in international law and historical records should not be content with our study. We encourage Apfelroth and others to improve on our efforts. In the interim, we feel this study, as well as the only other published sample survey we know of on the subject, point to violence from the Coalition Forces as {{the main cause of}} death and remind us that the number of Iraqi deaths is certainly many times higher than reported by passive surveillance methods or in press accounts." ...|$|E

Some conclusions <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>are</b> that Kalanchoe beharensis advantageously performs CAM fully during the entire arid seasons, avoiding CAM idling. This plant can do this because of its ability to maintain the correct water balance in its leaves, even in periods of drought.|$|E
50|$|EMAS is a {{comprehensive}} and demanding premium label, whose implementation requires some financial and personnel resources. In return, EMAS provides organisations with many advantages that can easily outweigh these costs. As EMAS is tailored to individual performance improvements, each organisation has to consider different environmental and economic factors. Given the heterogeneity of registered organisations, calculating average benefits and costs of EMAS is nearly unfeasible. The financial benefits of an EMAS registered organisation can differ per country. For example, some countries offer substantial reductions of waste fees, lower permitting costs, faster licensing procedures, etc. Nevertheless, several studies have been undertaken to provide reference points on the benefits and costs.In 2009, the European Commission published the Study on the Costs and Benefits of EMAS to Registered Organisations.
