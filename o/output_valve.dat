25|$|Many PID loops {{control a}} {{mechanical}} device (for example, a valve). Mechanical maintenance {{can be a}} major cost and wear leads to control degradation {{in the form of}} either stiction or a deadband in the mechanical response to an input signal. The rate of mechanical wear is mainly a function of how often a device is activated to make a change. Where wear is a significant concern, the PID loop may have an output deadband to reduce the frequency of activation of the <b>output</b> (<b>valve).</b> This is accomplished by modifying the controller to hold its output steady if the change would be small (within the defined deadband range). The calculated output must leave the deadband before the actual output will change.|$|E
50|$|In a class B {{push-pull}} amplifier, <b>output</b> <b>valve</b> current {{which must}} be provided by the power supply ranges from nearly zero for zero signal to a maximum at maximum signal. Consequently, for linear response to transient signal changes the power supply must have good regulation.|$|E
50|$|The new three stage i-VTEC {{valvetrain}} has low-rpm, high-rpm and cylinder idle mode. High <b>output</b> <b>valve</b> timing {{help the}} engine to increase its output by 9 percent.

As a result, recovery of energy wasted during braking is improved by 10 percent.|$|E
50|$|The {{cancellation}} of the differential <b>output</b> <b>valves</b> also largely cancels the (dominant) even-order harmonic distortion products of the output stage, resulting in less THD, albeit dominated now by odd-order harmonics and no longer monotonic.|$|R

50|$|The {{amplifier}} used KT88 <b>output</b> <b>valves,</b> two ECC83 preamp {{valves and}} one ECC82 valve. Approximately 1,200 of these amps were produced from 1967 to 1974; Marshall ceased production when {{the supply of}} KT88s ran out.|$|R
50|$|These devices {{generally}} {{consisted of}} a 12AU7 medium-mu triode driving a single 6L6GC beam power pentode audio <b>output</b> <b>valve</b> or similar. Its effects are distinctive due to convolution of the non-linearity of the triode interacting {{with those of the}} pentode, with both devices operating in class-A mode. The 6L6GC is similar in performance to the industrial type 5881, and also the European type KT66.|$|E
50|$|A common myth {{is that a}} {{short-circuit}} in an <b>output</b> <b>valve</b> {{may result}} in the loudspeaker being connected directly across the power supply and destroyed. In practice, the older Futterman-style amplifiers {{have been known to}} damage speakers, due not to shorts but to oscillation. The Circlotron amplifiers often feature direct-coupled outputs, but proper engineering (with a few well-placed fuses) ensures that damage to a speaker is no more likely than with an output transformer.|$|E

50|$|Earlier designs used {{transformers}} {{to couple}} the output signal from one stage to the next. A transformer with a centre-tapped secondary {{was used as}} a simple method to drive the push-pull <b>output</b> <b>valves</b> in anti-phase from the previous single-ended stage.|$|R
50|$|The biasing of a {{push-pull}} {{output stage}} {{can be adjusted}} (at the design stage, usually not in a finished amplifier) between class A (giving best open-loop linearity) through classes AB1 and AB2, to class B (giving greatest power and efficiency from a given power supply, <b>output</b> <b>valves</b> and <b>output</b> transformer).|$|R
50|$|The use of {{differential}} ("push-pull") output stages cancels standing bias current drawn through the output transformer {{by each of}} the <b>output</b> <b>valves</b> individually, greatly reducing the problem of core saturation and thus facilitating the construction of more powerful amplifiers {{at the same time}} as using smaller, wider bandwidth and cheaper transformers.|$|R

5000|$|Most modern {{open-circuit}} scuba sets have {{a diving}} regulator {{consisting of a}} first-stage pressure-reducing valve connected to the diving cylinder's <b>output</b> <b>valve</b> or manifold. This regulator reduces the pressure from the cylinder, which may be up to , to a lower pressure, generally between about 9 and 11 bar above the ambient pressure. A low-pressure hose links this with the second-stage regulator, or [...] "demand valve", which is mounted on the mouthpiece. Exhalation occurs through a rubber one-way mushroom valve in the chamber of the demand valve, directly into the water quite close to the diver's mouth. Some early single hose scuba sets used full-face masks instead of a mouthpiece, such as those made by Desco [...] and Scott Aviation [...] (who continue to make breathing units of this configuration for use by firefighters).|$|E
50|$|Typical normal-service engine valve-train {{components}} {{may be too}} lightweight {{for operating}} at high revolutions per minute (RPM), leading to valve float. This occurs when {{the action of the}} valve no longer completely opens or closes, such as when the valve spring force is insufficient to close the valve (it does not fully rest on its seat even though the cam would allow the valve to close) causing a loss of control of the valvetrain, as well as a drop in power <b>output.</b> <b>Valve</b> float will damage the valvetrain over time, and could cause the valve to be damaged as it is still partially open while the piston comes to the top of its stroke. Upgrading to high pressure valve springs could allow higher valvetrain speeds, but this would also overload the valvetrain components and cause excessive and costly wear.|$|E
50|$|Many modern {{commercial}} amplifiers (and some hobbyist constructions) place multiple {{pairs of}} <b>output</b> <b>valves</b> of readily obtainable types in parallel to increase power, operating {{from the same}} voltage required by a single pair. A beneficial side effect is that the output impedance of the valves, and thus the transformer turns ratio needed, is reduced, {{making it easier to}} construct a wide bandwidth transformer.|$|R
5000|$|Push-pull {{output stages}} can use triodes for lowest Zout and best linearity, but often use tetrodes or pentodes which give greater gain and power.

50|$|In {{order to}} analyze a macrobotanical assemblage, several steps may be taken. First, charred and {{waterlogged}} macrobotanical remains must {{be separated from}} soil by {{a process known as}} flotation. Mineralized remains and remains from extremely dry contexts can usually be separated from soil and roots with careful dry sieving alone. Although flotation systems differ in size, design, and number of components {{in order to meet the}} needs of the assemblage and the restrictions of the site, each system accomplishes the same basic task. Passing water over a soil sample separates the remains into light and heavy fractions. The heavy fraction weighs more than water and, thus, sinks to the bottom and is collected in a screen. The light fraction, which contains the plant remains, floats above the water and is sorted onto another, finer screen. Residual dirt and water are drained out of the unit through an <b>output</b> <b>valve.</b> Light and heavy fractions are then dried to prepare them for analysis.|$|E

However I was fascinated with chemistry, physics and maths. Later in medical college I soon realized knowledge in chemistry and physics was worthwhile. Zoology was not relevant. Much later while training in cardiology it was that the advantage of learning mathematics really helped. Calculations of cardiac <b>output,</b> <b>valve</b> areas, resistance, impedance {{and a host of other}} measurements were made easy.

500|$|In {{the days}} of valves (vacuum tubes), most {{loudspeakers}} had a nominal impedance of 16Ω. [...] <b>Valve</b> <b>outputs</b> require an output transformer to match the very high output impedance and voltage of the <b>output</b> <b>valves</b> to this lower impedance. [...] These transformers were commonly tapped to allow matching of the output to a multiple loudspeaker setup. [...] For example, two 16Ω loudspeakers in parallel will give an impedance of 8Ω. [...] Since the advent of solid-state amplifiers whose outputs require no transformer, the once-common multiple-impedance outputs have become rare, and lower impedance loudspeakers more common. [...] The most common nominal impedance for a single loudspeaker is now 8Ω. [...] Most solid-state amplifiers are designed to work with loudspeaker combinations of anything from 4Ω to 8Ω.|$|R

50|$|A {{particularly}} {{critical component}} is the output transformer of a valve amplifier.

(The valves can deliver a low current at a high voltage; the speakers require high current at low voltage.) Most solid-state power amplifiers need no output transformer at all.|$|R
40|$|AbstractValve {{interstitial}} {{cells are}} dispersed throughout the heart valve and {{play an important}} role in maintaining its integrity, function, and phenotype. While prior studies have detailed the role of external mechanical and biological factors in the function of the interstitial cell, the role of cell shape in regulating contractile function, in the context of normal and diseased phenotypes, is not well understood. Thus, the aim of this study was to elucidate the link between cell shape, phenotype, and acute functional contractile <b>output.</b> <b>Valve</b> interstitial cell monolayers with defined cellular shapes were engineered via constraining cells to micropatterned protein lines (10, 20, 40, 60 or 80 µm wide). Samples were cultured in either normal or osteogenic medium. Cellular shape and architecture were quantified via fluorescent imaging techniques. Cellular contractility was quantified using a valve thin film assay and phenotype analyzed via western blotting, zymography, and qRT-PCR. In all pattern widths, cells were highly aligned, with maximum cell and nuclear elongation occurring for the 10 μm pattern width. Cellular contractility was highest for the most elongated cells, but was also increased in cells on the widest pattern (80 μm) that also had increased CX 43 expression, suggesting a role for both elongated shape and increased cell-cell contact in regulating contractility. Cells cultured in osteogenic medium had greater expression of smooth muscle markers and correspondingly increased contractile stress responses. Cell phenotype did not significantly correlate with altered cell shape, suggesting that cellular shape plays a significant role in the regulation of valve contractile function independent of phenotype...|$|E

While the source of the water decreases and becomes scarce during the dry season. So the real action to improve agricultural products is indispensable. One way to meet the water needs of plants properly is to calculate the crop evapotranspiration with Penman-Monteith equation. While the tools to realize the results of these calculations is to create an irrigation controllers system. Irrigation control system that is made has inputs from weather environment obtained with the sensor and has an <b>output</b> <b>valve</b> to drain the water.

40|$|In December 2005 a {{heavy ion}} beam pumped UV excimer laser has been {{successfully}} demonstrated {{for the first time}} in the experiments performed at the GSI-SIS-HHT target area [1, 2]. The primary goal for this experiment was to demonstrate laser effect on the KrF * line (= 248 nm) and to proof this using various methods. The dependence of spontaneous and stimulated emission from pressure and composition of the laser gas has also been studied. Unfortunately, absolute measurements were not yet possible in this pioneering experiment but the relative pressure dependencies of laser light and spontaneous emission could be studied. A mixture of an excimer gas mixture (99, 5 % Kr and 0, 5 % F 2) and a buffer gas (pure Ar) was used as the laser medium. In order to avoid F 2 depletion due to chemical reactions, a continuous flow of gas was maintained in the laser cell. The composition of the laser gas could be varied by changing the flow rates for the excimer and buffer gases. Basically, two mixing ratios of 65 / 35 and 40 / 60 for Ar/Excimer were used and the pressure was controlled within a region from 1. 2 to 2 bar by adjusting the <b>output</b> <b>valve.</b> Examples of spectra of spontaneous emission which registered perpendicular to a laser axis are shown in Fig. 1 for a mixing ratio Ar/excimer of 40 / 60 and different pressures.

50|$|The {{overall effect}} of the {{original}} developments was to produce a highly effective power amplifier tube, whose anode characteristic {{is very much like}} that of a pentode, but which has greater efficiency as a result of reduced screen current.

40|$|The Thesis {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} to electrical resonators and some instruments which are special to the centimeter region of wavelengths. The excitation of resonators by {{the principle of the}} velocity modulation of electrons is then given and it is followed by a brief mention of velocity modulated oscillators and magnetron oscillators. Little specific mention is made in these sections of the author's work. A reference is however made to an early split anode 3 cm. magnetron and also to a tunable velocity modulated oscillator. These were made by him before such tubes had passed the experimental stage. The development of magnetrons required some simple but reliable method of measuring pulsed high tension power. Some satisfactory methods developed by the author are described. To prevent there being any possible doubt, these power measurements were checked by careful measurement of the heat developed in the magnetron. To examine the electric fields within resonators and feeder lines small test probes and loops are necessary. These probes and loops require a consideration of the various types of rectifiers, detector instruments and high frequency matching sections. All are discussed both from their simplicity of design and from their performance. For the design of 3 cm. magnetrons, whose output system was to be matched to the standard fitting used in the Services, an accurate standing wave measuring instrument was built. The errors occurring in these instruments are examined and shown to be negligible only under certain conditions of operation. The general properties of wave guides and coaxial cables are given prior to an account of the author's experiments on the measurements of magnetron output powers. Mention of preliminary work on power measurement is made and is followed by a full description of a rugged glass contained helical absorber suitable for low or for high power routine measurements. Full details of the calibration of the absorbers is given. There are also details of a calorimeter for coaxial output valves and also for wave guide output valves. These instruments have given a trouble free performance for nearly two years and are eminently suited for use in factories for testing the quality of the valves produced. The increase in the output powers tram magnetrons soon necessitated a complete redesign in the output system.

40|$|In this work, {{the robust}} {{control of the}} <b>output</b> <b>valve</b> of a water brake is {{investigated}} for the transient loading of a marine diesel engine. Experimental models of the water brake - engine array are derived, corresponding to different operating points. Those models are processed in order to derive an uncertain model that characterizes the system {{in a wide range}} of operating points. A μ-synthesis controller is developed, based on the uncertain model derived. The controller is tested on a water brake coupled with a marine diesel engine at LME/NTUA in order to evaluate the controller performance and the software simulation results. Initially, datasets were obtained by providing the open-loop system with an appropriate Pseudo-Random Binary Signal (PRBS) signal. Datasets were then pre-processed and split for identification and validation use. Multiple models were derived using both subspace (Numerical algorithm for Subspace State Space System IDentification (N 4 SID)) and polynomial (Prediction Error Method (PEM)) algorithms. Those models were evaluated against a validation dataset and the models providing the best fit were selected. Then, depending on the operating point that each model was based on, models were separated into two pools: “average” and “extreme”. The “average” model pool was used to select nominal models and the “extreme” model pool was used as a representation of worst-case scenarios. By combining these pools appropriately, uncertain models were derived. Given the complexity of the system examined and the presence of non-linearities, all controllers developed were 2 -Degrees-of-Freedom (DOF) μ-synthesis controllers. Different controllers were derived based on different uncertain models. Consequently, different stability and performance properties were observed. A software simulation setup was developed in order to evaluate the controllers against the models derived. By testing a controller against a model from the “extreme” pool, its robustness was evaluated. Finally, the controllers that showed the most merit during software simulation, were evaluated at the experimental testbed of LME. The controllers functioned satisfactorily and the software simulation results approached those obtained experimentally, proving the soundness of the modeling.
