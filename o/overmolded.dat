40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{push for}} leadfree microelectronics {{has caused the}} industry to revamp its design, material selection, and manufacturing processes of its products. However, the needs of industry have surpassed the current lead free standards set up by organizations such as JEDEC.

Laminate based system in package products, which combine assembly process and materials, historically, have been limited to meeting Moisture Sensitivity Level (MSL) 3 at 240 C. It is now possible to achieve this level at 260 C – a temperature requested by customers for leadfree assembly. The use of lead free solders has caused a significant rise in the reflow temperatures of packages and has therefore prompted the need for hightemperature <b>overmold</b> compounds.

The Rappaport-Sprague model stethoscope was heavy and short (18 - 24 in) with an antiquated appearance recognizable by their two large independent latex rubber tubes connecting an exposed leaf-spring-joined pair of opposing F-shaped chrome-plated brass binaural ear tubes with a dual-head chest piece.Several other minor refinements were made to stethoscopes until, in the early 1960s, David Littmann, a Harvard Medical School professor, created a new stethoscope that was lighter than previous models and had improved acoustics.

We developed a numerical method to describe this inhomogeneous polymer flow. The reason for flow front fingering seems to be local variations of polymer viscosity which enforces a necking on distinct flow paths. Fingering can cause the formation of air traps and excessive wire sweep.
