In the late 1970s, 3M-Littmann introduced the tunable diaphragm: a very hard (G-10) glass-epoxy resin diaphragm member with an <b>overmolded</b> silicone flexible acoustic surround which permitted increased excursion of the diaphragm member in a Z-axis {{with respect to the}} plane of the sound collecting area. The left shift to a lower resonant frequency increases the volume of some low frequency sounds due to the longer waves propagated by the increased excursion of the hard diaphragm member suspended in the concentric accountic surround. Conversely, restricting excursion of the diaphragm by pressing the stethoscope diaphragm surface firmly against the anatomical area overlying the physiological sounds of interest, the acoustic surround could also be used to dampen excursion of the diaphragm in response to [...] "z"-axis pressure against a concentric fret.

40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{push for}} leadfree microelectronics {{has caused the}} industry to revamp its design, material selection, and manufacturing processes of its products. However, the needs of industry have surpassed the current lead free standards set up by organizations such as JEDEC.

The Rappaport-Sprague was later made by Hewlett-Packard. HP's medical products division was spun off as part of Agilent Technologies, Inc., where it became Agilent Healthcare.

The Rappaport-Sprague model stethoscope was heavy and short (18 - 24 in) with an antiquated appearance recognizable by their two large independent latex rubber tubes connecting an exposed leaf-spring-joined pair of opposing F-shaped chrome-plated brass binaural ear tubes with a dual-head chest piece.Several other minor refinements were made to stethoscopes until, in the early 1960s, David Littmann, a Harvard Medical School professor, created a new stethoscope that was lighter than previous models and had improved acoustics.

We developed a numerical method to describe this inhomogeneous polymer flow. The reason for flow front fingering seems to be local variations of polymer viscosity which enforces a necking on distinct flow paths. Fingering can cause the formation of air traps and excessive wire sweep.
