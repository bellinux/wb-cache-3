5|$|Concerns {{continued}} to be raised that the blockhouse's guns could not fire downriver and by the 1830s it had been decided to focus investment on the New Tavern and Tilbury forts. The blockhouse itself fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> as a magazine in 1834, being briefly used as a government store, and the adjacent gun platforms were sold off in 1835. The blockhouse building was subsequently demolished in 1844.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the Metropolitan line-operated Inner Circle route {{was given}} its own {{identity}} {{on the tube}} map as the Circle line. In June 1957, the reversing bay track was taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> and the track bed was later filled to connect the two island platforms. The eastbound MR platform (Number 1) and westbound DR platform (Number 4) were taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in January 1966 and March 1969 respectively. The tracks for these platforms were also removed and platform 4 was subsequently demolished in the early 1970s to allow escalators to be provided to the Piccadilly line. The widened island platform is now served by the District and Circle lines in both directions. Following the closure of platforms 1 and 4, platform 3 was renumbered as 1. The current arrangement has trains running in opposite directions to the original layout. During service disruption or engineering works, trains can also run Eastbound from Platform 1. The arcaded station entrance and shops, the brick retaining walls to the sub-surface platforms and the Exhibition Road pedestrian tunnel are Grade II listed structures.|$|E

5|$|Since 1924, {{the castle}} has been {{designated}} as a Scheduled Ancient Monument which is intended to protect important archaeological sites from change. During the Second World War Starfish sites were built as decoys for bombing raids. Nine were built around Manchester, including one close to Buckton Castle. At this time a brick hut was built over part of the castle ditch. The Starfish site went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in 1943.|$|E

By 1930, the name had already fallen <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E

Much later transports of warships across the Isthmus in the late 9th century and around 1150 are assumed to have used a route other than the Diolkos due to the extensive time lag.|$|E

5|$|The castle descended {{through the}} Earls of Moray and {{subsequently}} the Earls of March before coming {{under the control}} of the Scottish Crown. A 'toun' was established near the castle. While it is unclear at what point Tibbers Castle fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> by the 18th century the site was used for agriculture.
