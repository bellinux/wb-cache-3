However, according to the Scalar Specificity Constraint, if Chinese were to have other non-vertical <b>open</b> <b>scale</b> motion morphemes, 上/下 shang/xia ‘ascend/descend’ should be able to co-occur with and follow them.|$|R
30|$|According to the hierarchy, 飛 fei ‘fly’ should precede 升 sheng ‘ascend’. However, 升飛 sheng-fei ascend-fly in 16 {{does not}} {{represent}} a strong challenge to the hierarchy for two reasons. First, the corpus has in total 35 MMMCs consisting of a nonscalar change motion morpheme (e.g., 走 zou ‘walk’, 跑 pao ‘run’, 跳 tiao ‘jump’) and an <b>open</b> <b>scale</b> motion morpheme (e.g., 上 shang ‘ascend’, 下 xia ‘descend’, 走 zou ‘away’). 升飛 Sheng-fei ascend-fly is the only instance in which the <b>open</b> <b>scale</b> motion morpheme precedes the nonscalar change motion morpheme, whereas in all other 34 instances, {{the order of the}} morphemes follows the hierarchy, i.e. an <b>open</b> <b>scale</b> motion morpheme is preceded by a nonscalar change motion morpheme.|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{application}} of area morphology to image classification. From the input image, a scale space is created by successive application of an area morphology operator. The pixels within the scale space corresponding to the same image location form a scale space vector. A scale space vector therefore contains the intensity of a particular pixel for a given set of scales, determined in this approach by image granulometry. Using the standard-means algorithm or the fuzzy-means algorithm, the image pixels can be classified by clustering the associated scale space vectors. The scale space classifier presented here {{is rooted in the}} novel area open [...] close and area close [...] <b>open</b> <b>scale</b> spaces. Unlike other scale generating filters, the area operators affect the image by removing connected components within the image level sets that do not satisfy the minimum area criterion. To show that the area open [...] close and area close [...] <b>open</b> <b>scale</b> spaces provide an effective multiscale structure for image classification, we demonstrate the fidelity, causality, and edge localization properties for the scale spaces. The analysis also reveals that the area open [...] close and area close [...] <b>open</b> <b>scale</b> spaces improve classification by clustering members of similar objects more effectively than the fixed scale classifier. Experimental results are provided that demonstrate the reduction in intraregion classification error and in overall classification error given by the scale space classifier for classification applications where object scale is important. In both visual and objective comparisons, the scale space approach outperforms the traditional fixed scale clustering algorithms and the parametric Bayesian classifier for classification tasks that depend on object scale...|$|R

30|$|Figure  4 {{illustrates}} {{the order of}} the nonscalar change motion morpheme 跑 pao ‘run’ and its co-occurring motion morphemes. Like 走 zou ‘walk’, there is no motion morpheme preceding 跑 pao ‘run’. In addition, 跑 pao ‘run’ is found to precede all other types of motion morphemes, as shown in the column {{to the right of the}} 跑 pao ‘run’ column. Therefore, both the distributions of 走 zou ‘walk’ and 跑 pao ‘run’ are consistent with the hierarchy. Furthermore, for both 走 zou ‘walk’ and 跑 pao ‘run’, closed scale motion morphemes are the most frequent co-occurring type, followed by 到 dao ‘arrive’ and then <b>open</b> <b>scale</b> motion morphemes.|$|R
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this second corpus study is to verify the Motion Morpheme Hierarchy once again by {{investigating}} MMMCs in another corpus. For each scalar class in the hierarchy, the first two most frequently used motion morphemes in Corpus Study 1 were selected for study (three motion morphemes are selected for the class of <b>open</b> <b>scale</b> motion morphemes; see explanation below). These morphemes were searched for in a larger corpus, the novel category of the CCL Corpus, to investigate whether they and their co-occurring motion morphemes follow the order expected from the hierarchy. To make the study feasible, only the first 1, 000 instances retrieved from the search of each motion morpheme were collected for further analysis.|$|R

To overcome some limitations of cur-rent modelling approaches, the semi-process-based, spatially semi-distributed modelling framework WASA-SED (Vers. 1) was developed for water and sediment transport in large dryland catchments. The WASA-SED model simulates the runoff and erosion processes at the hillslope scale, the trans-port and retention processes of suspended and bedload fluxes in the river reaches and the retention and remobilisation pro-cesses of sediments in reservoirs.

40|$|In {{the minds}} of many, large <b>scale</b> <b>open</b> air festivals have become {{associated}} with spring and summer, attracting many people, {{and in the case}} of music festivals, thousands of music fans.

Sexual transmission of infectious diseases may also occur and is likely to be underestimated and underreported. Enhanced surveillance during and after festivals is essential. Preventive measures such as immunisations of participants and advice on-site and via social networks should be considered to reduce outbreaks at these large <b>scale</b> <b>open</b> air festivals...|$|R
