25|$|Brazil generates nearly three-quarters (73%) of its {{electricity}} from hydropower. This contribution was {{as high as}} four-fifths in 2010 but the share of hydropower has been eroded {{by a combination of}} declining rainfall and ageing hydroelectric plants, many of which date back to the 1960s and 1970s. Intensive use of thermoelectric power plants operating on fossil fuels has compensated for much of the loss, since the share of new sources of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, in the energy mix remains small. Moreover, although Brazil has made great strides in the use of bioethanol in transportation, there has been little focus on research and innovation in energy generation, be it in terms of developing new sources of energy or improving energy efficiency.

25|$|The President of the United States of America takes {{pleasure}} in presenting the Legion of Merit to Rear Admiral Charles Elliott Loughlin (NSN: 0-72307/1100), United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious conduct {{in the performance}} of outstanding services to the Government of the United States as Commander Submarine Flotilla SIX from 24 August 1964 to 24 September 1966. As an extremely competent and resourceful leader, Rear Admiral Loughlin exercised military and operational command over a major portion of the Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet during a period of unprecedented growth. In particular, he supervised the post construction and post overhaul pre-deployment training, Demonstration and Shakedown Operations (DASO) and tactical load out periods for the Fleet Ballistic Missile Submarines in an exemplary manner. By virtue of dynamic leadership and outstanding professional knowledge, he ensured the successful operation of two SSBN replenishment sites and the effective functioning of off crew support operations at Charleston, South Carolina. Rear Admiral Loughlin further {{has proven to be a}} most articulate and impressive spokesman for the Navy. In carrying out all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foregoing</b> duties, as well as the additional NATO duty of Commander Submarine Force, Eastern Atlantic Area (Designate), Rear Admiral Loughlin has demonstrated the finest degree of judgment and an inspiring devotion to duty which has been fully in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|E
500|$|Photometric {{measurements}} of Vega during the 1930s appeared {{to show that}} the star had a low-magnitude variability on the order of ±0.03 magnitudes. This range of variability was near the limits of observational capability for that time, and so the subject of Vega's variability has been controversial. The magnitude of Vega was measured again in 1981 at the David Dunlap Observatory and showed some slight variability. Thus it was suggested that Vega showed occasional low-amplitude pulsations associated with a Delta Scuti variable. This is a category of stars that oscillate in a coherent manner, resulting in periodic pulsations in the star's luminosity. Although Vega fits the physical profile for this type of variable, other observers have found no such variation. Thus the variability was thought to possibly be the result of systematic errors in measurement. However, a 2007 article surveyed these and other results, and concluded that [...] "A conservative analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foregoing</b> results suggests that Vega is quite likely variable in the 1-2% range, with possible occasional excursions to as much as 4% from the mean". Also, a 2011 article affirms on its abstract that [...] "The long-term (year-to-year) variability of Vega was confirmed".|$|E
