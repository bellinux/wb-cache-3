25|$|The {{first meeting}} {{took place on}} 8 August, but the RAC would not allow the public to attend, wanting an <b>opening</b> <b>meeting</b> to be run {{successfully}} before allowing paying spectators; nonetheless some 3,000 club members and their guests attended as spectators. The main event {{of the day was}} the 33-lap 49.6-mile Formula Two race which was won by Tony Rolt driving Rob Walker’s Connaught A Type. The supporting Formula III event was divided into three 10-lap heats (won by Don Trueman, Charles Headland and Don Parker) and a 17-lap final which went to Les Leston.|$|E
25|$|By April 1954, {{the track}} {{had grown to}} 2.23 miles in length and {{within a year of}} the <b>opening</b> <b>meeting</b> had grown again, to 2.761 miles. On Easter 1975, another circuit layout, {{measuring}} 1.654 miles, came into use. Oulton Park is unique amongst the new post-World War II circuits in that it is a true road circuit whilst its contemporaries were, with one exception, converted airfields (the exception being the short-lived Blandford). It has something in common with Mallory Park in that it can trace its history back a very long way (possibly as far as Roman times) and is mentioned in the Doomsday Book as ‘Aleton’.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the {{remainder}} of the 1930s Gerard continued to compete in trials and sprint races, and after purchasing a 1½ litre Riley Sprite he also began to participate in circuit racing. Early club races at his East Midlands home circuit Donington Park continued his success, with Gerard taking two victories over cars with much larger engines, as well as ninth in the prestigious Donington TT race. In between running the family business, Gerard continued to compete at Donington as often as he could, driving in the Nuffield Trophy in 1938 and 1939, although without success. With war looming, in 1939 he also took the little Riley down to the Brooklands circuit in Surrey. At that year's <b>Opening</b> <b>Meeting</b> he took a highly creditable third place, and won a Campbell circuit handicap race later in the year.|$|E

25|$|Following on {{from his}} Macau performance, van Asseldonk signed {{to compete in}} the Toyota Racing Series with Giles Motorsport, for the 2012 {{championship}} held in January and February. Van Asseldonk made an immediate impact on the series, taking two victories at the <b>opening</b> <b>meeting</b> at Teretonga. After failing to take a podium at the second meeting at Timaru, van Asseldonk finished in third place in the opening race of the third weekend at Taupo, before winning the final race of the weekend. Although he failed to win another race during the season, he finished four of the remaining six races of the season – at Hampton Downs and Manfeild – on the podium, including three second places, to secure himself second place in the Drivers' Championship, although 176 points in arrears of the champion, team-mate Nick Cassidy. Upon his return from New Zealand, van Asseldonk signed a contract with Fortec Motorsports to contest the British Formula 3 Championship in 2012. He currently lies ninth in the Drivers' Championship after the first two meetings of the season; his best race result so far is a fourth-place finish at Monza.|$|E
500|$|Grant {{had been}} careful {{to watch the}} {{elections}} and secretly sent Phil Sheridan in to keep {{law and order in}} the state. Sheridan had arrived in New Orleans {{a few days before the}} January 4, 1875 legislature <b>opening</b> <b>meeting.</b> At the convention the Democrats again with military force took control of the state building out of Republican hands. Initially, the Democrats were protected by federal troops under Colonel Régis de Trobriand, and the escaped Republicans were removed from the hallways of the state building. However, Governor Kellogg then requested that Trobriand reseat the Republicans. [...] Trobriand returned to the State house and used bayonets to force the Democrats out of the building. The Republicans then organized their own house with their own speakers all being protected by the Federal Army. [...] Sheridan, who had annexed the Department of the Gulf to his command at 9:00 P.M., claimed that the federal troops were being neutral since they had also protected the Democrats earlier.|$|E
500|$|Even {{arranging}} the conference proved a struggle, with the Rhodesians taking exception to being served cards of admittance on 27 October denoting them [...] "The Smith Delegation", {{rather than the}} [...] "Rhodesian Government Delegation" [...] as had happened in previous conferences and correspondence. The Rhodesians unilaterally altered their cards to this effect, then confronted Richard with them, causing him some shock. The conference was eventually arranged to commence on 28 October at 15:00, but at very short notice the British mediator delayed the start for two hours; some Patriotic Front delegates were questioning his role as chairman and threatening not to attend, and Richard hoped to talk them around in the extra time. When the parties finally met, some hours later than planned, Muzorewa sat opposite Smith {{as the leader of}} the nationalist delegates, as at Victoria Falls, but with empty seats directly either side of him, marked [...] "Comrade Enos Nkala" [...] and [...] "Comrade Edson Sithole" [...] respectively—each of these ZANU cadres had refused to attend the <b>opening</b> <b>meeting</b> despite Richard's entreaties. The mediator read an opening statement from British Prime Minister James Callaghan which, to the nationalists' delight and the government's chagrin, referred to the country as [...] "Zimbabwe". The proceedings were then adjourned, to start again the next day.|$|E
25|$|King {{helped found}} the United Nations in 1945 and {{attended}} the <b>opening</b> <b>meetings</b> in San Francisco. However, he became pessimistic about the organization's future possibilities. After the war, King quickly dismantled wartime controls. Unlike World War I, press censorship ended with the hostilities. He began an ambitious program of social programs and {{laid the groundwork for}} Newfoundland's later entry into Canada.|$|R

On Crosby's [...] 94th birthday in March 1914, Alice Rector and the King's Daughters of the First Methodist Church of Bridgeport, Connecticut organized a Violet Day to honor her, which was publicized nationally by Hugh Main.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{appointed}} day, May 14, 1787, only the Virginia and Pennsylvania delegations were present, {{and so the}} convention's <b>opening</b> <b>meeting</b> was postponed {{for lack of a}} quorum. A quorum of seven states met and deliberations began on May 25. Eventually twelve states were represented; 74 delegates were named, 55 attended and 39 signed. The delegates were generally convinced that an effective central government {{with a wide range of}} enforceable powers must replace the weaker Congress established by the Articles of Confederation. Their depth of knowledge and experience in self-government was remarkable. As Thomas Jefferson in Paris wrote to John Adams in London, [...] "It really is an assembly of demigods." ...|$|E
2500|$|Davey {{planned to}} contest the [...] The Liberal Government had by now been {{replaced}} by the Reform Government. At the <b>opening</b> <b>meeting</b> of his campaign, Davey refused to commit himself to a motion of no confidence against the government, which in turn resulted in the meeting refusing to give him a vote of confidence. A week later, he withdrew his nomination. This left three other candidates in the election: Henry Thacker (who had contested the previous election as an Independent Liberal, but with Davey's withdrawal contested as behalf of the Liberal Party), George Duncan Macfarlane (an auctioneer with no prior political experience who stood for the Reform Party), and Hiram Hunter (who this time contested for the Social Democratic Party, which was the successor to the original Labour Party). Thacker was successful and succeeded Davey.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>opening</b> race <b>meeting</b> {{was held}} on 2 November 1959. [...] Originally 1.28 km in length, the track was {{extended}} to 1.6 km in 1960 and was sealed in the same year.|$|R
50|$|An {{invocation}} {{can also}} be a secular alternative to a prayer. On August 30, 2012, Dan Nerren, a member of the Humanist Association of Tulsa, delivered a secular invocation to open a meeting of the City Council of Tulsa. Nerren was invited to perform the invocation as a compromise following a long-running dispute with the City Council over prayers <b>opening</b> <b>meetings.</b> The invocation was written by Andrew Lovley, a member of the Southern Maine Association of Secular Humanists who had previously used the invocation in 2009 to invoke an inauguration ceremony for new city officials in South Portland, Maine.|$|R
5|$|After Indonesia proclaimed its {{independence}} on 17 August 1945, {{the entirety of}} Sumatra was declared a de facto part of the country. The central government established Teuku Muhammad Hasan as the island's first governor, and on 29 October 1945 Hasan selected Amir as the government representative in Langkat (later equated to regent), with his office at Binjai. Amir accepted the position readily, subsequently handling numerous tasks set by the central government, including inaugurating the first local division of the People's Safety Army (Tentara Keamanan Rakjat; the predecessor to the Indonesian Army) <b>opening</b> <b>meetings</b> of various local branches of national political parties, and promoting education– particularly Latin-alphabet literacy.|$|R
2500|$|Thus Brands Hatch {{was born}} as a motor racing venue, and on 16 April 1950, the <b>opening</b> <b>meeting</b> was {{scheduled}} for the first purpose-built post-war racing circuit in England, approval having been given by the RAC following a demonstration {{by a handful of}} 500s in February. Amongst those giving the demonstration was a very young Stirling Moss. The Half-Litre Car Club for 500cc Formula 3 organised that first race on 16 April, with 7,000 spectators coming to witness these cars complete in 10 races. The first victory went to a man who was to become a legend in Formula 3, Don Parker. Before the year was out, five meetings had been held, with the events running to a similar programme. The June meeting was a Moss benefit for he won all five races he entered in the Works Cooper and a set a new lap record. The August Bank Holiday meeting saw for the first time, involvement of the national press with the Daily Telegraph sponsoring the main event of the day. The old cinder track had been [...] in length, but the tarmac circuit was lengthened to [...] and now ran anticlockwise. The Maidstone & Mid-Kent Motor Club invited a number of sports car drivers to test the circuit on 5 November, this being the first time that any car other than a 500cc had used it, and they ran clockwise.|$|E

Vitter later reintroduced the resolution in January 2007 after a panel of the Fifth Circuit Court concluded that Christian prayers were unconstitutional but was undecided whether nonsectarian prayers were allowed. In July 2007, the full Fifth Circuit dismissed the case because of a lack of standing. The school board subsequently resumed prayer evocations but opened it to diverse community religions.
