5000|$|A food hub, {{as defined}} by the USDA, is “a {{centrally}} located facility with a business management structure facilitating the aggregation, storage, processing, distribution, and/or marketing of locally/regionally produced food products.” [...] Food hubs {{are a part of the}} agricultural value chain model and often share common values relating to conservation, sustainability, healthy food access, and supporting local farmers. A defining characteristic of food hubs is source identification, a food safety and marketing benefit that allows consumers to trace the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> they buy. [...] One of the primary goals of food hubs is to give small and medium-sized farmers access to larger or additional markets. Food hubs also fill gaps in food systems infrastructure, such as transportation, product storage, and product processing.

40|$|Abstract: The {{customs tariff}} for import {{is the main}} {{instrument}} for regulating the external commercial trade, {{according to the national}} economic benefits of the states. This practice in the international trade was ruled in Art. XI of the General Agreement for Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which also establishes that the contract parties in this agreement will not set up and support other restrictions for import exept the customs tariffs. Consequently, the customs fees for import are determined based on the customs tariff for import. The common customs tariff in the EU implies, besides applying the customs fees, a preference for third countries, on which the EU agrees. The wrong determining of the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> can affect the state budget, the local budget or even the fiscal features and the budget of the company. As the determining of the origin raises important problems in the practice of the customs authorities, in order to diminish the fiscal-budgetary impact, we would like to suggest to people who are interested in this a model, a possible unitary procedure for interpreting the complex provisions of the rules concerning the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>products...</b>|$|E

40|$|Products in {{a market}} are often branded with {{geographical}} names to get individual tint and indicate a place of their origin. Originating from a certain geographical region can sometimes be an attractive additional value for a consumer, {{on account of the}} established reputation or because of other reasons influencing his buying decision. Geographical names became therefore an instrument of commercial marketing which is also used to gain a higher market share. Legislations of many countries laid down protection of geographical names in consideration of the above, indicating at point of <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>products.</b> The author describes the way of regulating protection of geographical names in selected countries with due regard paid to the Federal Republic of Germany and France. Legal status of geographical names is differantiated. Separate regulation is particularly reserved to the so called brand names of origin (appellations of origin, appellation d'origine, ursprungsbezeichnung). Normative basis for protection of names indicating at <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> or services from a. certain geographical region in Poland is art. 4 of the Unfair Competition Act of 1926. According to the cited provision geographical names designating <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> are subject of common right of all persons operating firms on a given territory. In case of illegal usage of geographical names these persons and enterpreneurs selling these products are allowed several claims mentioned in the Act. The author discusses a nature of rights allowed to subjects mentioned in the Act reaching the conclusion that it is here a case of sui generis imperative rights. Their peculiar character {{lies in the fact that}} a circle of entitled persons is not defined and that these rights are unlimited in time and their formation and lasting are not conditioned by performing any formalities. Next, the author discusses conditions and possibilities of using geographical names in character of other distinguishing signs (brands of products in particular). Protection of geographical names is regulated in many legal acts of international range. The following belong to them: a) Paris Convention of 1883 on the protection of industrial property, b) Madrid Agreement of 1891 on prosecution of feigned or misleading designations of origin, c) Lisbon Agreement of 1958 on international registration of names of origin, d) bilateral international treaties. The author discusses these acts indicating at problems which are still awaiting satisfactory solution.
