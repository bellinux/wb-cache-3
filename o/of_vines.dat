5|$|The Ficus genus is {{composed}} of 800 species <b>of</b> <b>vines,</b> shrubs, and trees, including the cultivated fig, defined by their syconiums, the fruit-like vessels that either hold female flowers or pollen on the inside. Each fig species has its own fig wasp which (in most cases) pollinates the fig, so a tight mutual dependence has evolved and persisted throughout the genus.|$|E

5|$|The rubber vine {{could be}} destructively {{harvested}} by cutting up the vine and squeezing out the latex whilst it {{lay on the}} ground. This was quicker and easier than non-destructive harvesting and was practised by villagers who wished to fill their quotas and avoid punishment, especially once supplies of the vine began to run low. In addition some vines were destroyed deliberately by villagers who believed that once the rubber was gone Abir would leave the concession. Because of this destruction all rubber vines within 10km of Basankasu were depleted within 18 months of that post opening. In an attempt to slow the destruction <b>of</b> <b>vines</b> Abir issued orders in 1892 and 1904 which prohibited destructive harvesting methods but these were largely ineffective. In 1896 the Congo Free State ordered Abir to plant 150 rubber trees or vines for each ton of rubber exported to replace destructively harvested vines. This was increased to 500 plants per ton in 1902. By 1903 the plantation at the Bongandanga post held {{more than one million}} plants and by 1904 each Abir post employed around one hundred workers to manage its plantation. Despite this the plantation project was ultimately a failure {{due in part to the}} fact that each Abir agent remained at a post for just two years and was uninterested in working the plantation which would only benefit his successor. Congo Free State forestry officers also noted that Abir plantations were smaller than required or even existed only on paper. Abir would also plant vines which looked similar to the Landolphia vine but did not produce rubber, as a consequence the Free State required them to instead plant the Clitandra vine which was more easily recognisable but did not produce rubber in its first eight years. These vines may never have reached maturity as there is no evidence that these plantations ever produced rubber. In 1904 Abir began to run out <b>of</b> <b>vines</b> to tap and rubber production fell to half of that of 1903, which was 1000 tons. By 1904 rubber vines within 50 miles of Abir posts had been depleting, leading to violent clashes between rival villages over control of the remaining plants. The entirety of the Lulonga concession, to the west of Abir, produced just 7 tons of rubber in 1905.|$|E
25|$|The farming {{economy of}} this period {{continued}} the practices established {{at the beginning of}} the Neolithic, although sheep and goats were less dominant among the animals than they had previously been, and the cultivation <b>of</b> <b>vines</b> (Vitis vinifera) is well attested.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} French wine, spans {{a period of}} at least 2600 years dating to the {{founding}} of Massalia in the 6th century BC by Phocaeans with the possibility that viticulture existed much earlier. The Romans did much to spread viticulture across the land they knew as Gaul, encouraging the planting <b>of</b> <b>vines</b> in areas that would become the well known wine regions of Bordeaux, Burgundy, Alsace, Champagne, Languedoc, Loire Valley and the Rhone.|$|E
25|$|According to tradition, the war {{was caused}} by a {{conflict}} about the Lelantine Plain. This very fertile area had for a long time been used for agriculture, including the cultivation <b>of</b> <b>vines.</b> In Greece, where fertile land is scarce, wars for agriculturally attractive terrain were not uncommon, especially in the Archaic period, e.g. between Megara and Athens. Nevertheless, it remains unclear why Chalcis and Eretria suddenly came to blows over the Lelantine Plain after apparently being in agreement on its use for a long time.|$|E
25|$|Another {{indication}} {{of the importance of}} wine in ancient Israel is that Hebrew contains numerous terms for various stages and types <b>of</b> <b>vines,</b> grape varieties and words for wine. The word yayin was used both as a generic word for wine and as a term for wine in its first year, once it had undergone sufficient fermentation from the initial stage, when it was called tirosh. The type of wine was determined by the grapes, the time allowed for fermentation, and the age of the wine.|$|E

25|$|After Burgundy became {{incorporated}} in the Kingdom of France, {{and the power of}} the church decreased, many vineyards which had been in the church's hands were sold to the bourgeoisie from the 17th century. After the French revolution of 1789, the church's remaining vineyards were broken up and from 1791 sold off. The Napoleonic inheritance laws then resulted in the continued subdivision of the most precious vineyard holdings, so some growers hold only a row or two <b>of</b> <b>vines.</b> This led to the emergence of négociants who aggregate the produce of many growers to produce a single wine. It has also led to a profusion of increasingly smaller, family-owned wineries, exemplified by the dozen-plus Gros family domaines.|$|E
25|$|As Chardonnay buds early, it can {{be highly}} {{susceptible}} to spring time frost. However, it is a relatively hardy vine that can sustain cold winter temperatures unless they become extreme such as the hard freeze that devastated the 1985 vintage with temperatures dropping to -27°C (-16.6°F) in the winter, killing off a large portion <b>of</b> <b>vines.</b> As both Pinot noir and Chardonnay were affected on the hill of Corton, one long lasting result of this vintage is that the cépage of many lieu-dits on the hill changed with some producers replanting their previously Chardonnay vineyards with Pinot noir to make Corton AOC and vice versa. Also many new clones and rootstocks were introduced.|$|E
25|$|Other notable {{vineyards}} of the Mittelmosel {{include the}} sundial (German Sonnenuhr) vineyards; Brauneberg Juffer-Sonnenuhr, Wehlener Sonnenuhr, Zeltinger Sonnenuhr. In the 19th century, large sundials {{were built in}} these vineyards so that the workers would know what time to break for lunch {{or the end of}} the work day. Since these vineyards receive the most exposure to the sun, many of the wines produced from these vineyards are richer and more full-bodied than wine produced from other vineyards. In a similar way to many of Burgundy's Grand Cru vineyards, the Sonnenuhr vineyards are highly parceled with multiple owners of individual plots or rows <b>of</b> <b>vines.</b> The Wehlener Sonnenuhr vineyard alone has more than 200 owners.|$|E

25|$|Viniculture in the archipelago, and {{especially}} in Tenerife {{dates back to the}} conquest, when the settlers brought a variety <b>of</b> <b>vines</b> to plant. In the 16th and 17th centuries, wine production {{played an important role in}} the economy, and many families were dedicated to the culture and business. Of special mention is malvasía canary, considered the best wine of Tenerife and at the time one of the most desired wines in the world, being shipped across to the major warehouses of Europe and America. Writers such as William Shakespeare and Walter Scott make reference to the wine in some of their works. Tenerife has 5 main wine growing regions. These include Abona, Valle de Güímar, Valle de La Orotava, Tacoronte-Acentejo and Ycoden-Daute-Isora.|$|E
25|$|In {{materials}} science, {{and especially}} elasticity theory, ideas of torsion also {{play an important}} role. One problem models the growth <b>of</b> <b>vines,</b> focusing {{on the question of}} how vines manage to twist around objects. The vine itself is modeled as a pair of elastic filaments twisted around one another. In its energy-minimizing state, the vine naturally grows {{in the shape of a}} helix. But the vine may also be stretched out to maximize its extent (or length). In this case, the torsion of the vine is related to the torsion of the pair of filaments (or equivalently the surface torsion of the ribbon connecting the filaments), and it reflects the difference between the length-maximizing (geodesic) configuration of the vine and its energy-minimizing configuration.|$|E
25|$|The Cistercian monks {{set about}} proﬁtably using {{the land they}} had bought in a single-minded, well-planned and {{versatile}} way. Economic activities of the Cistercians included quarrying, the planting <b>of</b> <b>vines</b> {{on the slopes of}} the Saale and other suitable areas, the planting of orchards, the establishment of smithies, workshops for weaving, fur production and shoe-making, the setting-up of bakeries and cheese dairies as well as intense sheep rearing, grain growing, timber rafting and ﬁshing. The Cistercians expanded their property from the Köppelberg vineyard, and created nine steep slope vineyards between 1195 and 1208. At the end of the Middle Ages, the monastery owned 58 vineyards between Bad Kösen and Roßbach. Cellar and wine masters at Pforta ensured high quality in wine making, measuring it according to vinum bonum (1226), vinum melius (1289) or vinum terrestre (country wine, around 1340).|$|E

25|$|The inverse {{situation}} existed {{with regard}} to clearing for wood in the Amazon rain forest, of which about 15% had been cleared by 1994, {{and part of the}} remainder had been disturbed by selective logging. Because the Amazon forest is highly heterogeneous, with hundreds of woody species per hectare, there is considerable distance between individual trees of economic value, such as mahogany and cerejeira. Therefore, this type of forest is not normally cleared for timber extraction but logged through high-grading, or selection of the most valuable trees. Because <b>of</b> <b>vines,</b> felling, and transportation, their removal causes destruction of many other trees, and the litter and new growth create a risk of forest fires, which are otherwise rare in rainforests. In favorable locations, such as Paragominas, in the northeastern part of Pará State, a new pattern of timber extraction has emerged: diversification and the production of plywood have led to the economic use of more than 100 tree species.|$|E
25|$|Commercial {{production}} of bottle fermented sparkling wines from grapes grown in England {{started in the}} 1960s, {{although there has been}} a longer history of sparkling wines made in the UK from imported grapes. In the 1980s, some English winemakers started to grow the grape varieties as used in Champagne – Chardonnay, Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier – and in the ensuing decades availability of English sparkling wines made from these varieties increased. Today, there are over 100 vineyards in England producing sparkling wines with Nyetimber, Ridgeview and Chapel Down being some of the largest producers. In 2010, Chardonnay and Pinot noir were the two most commonly planted grape varieties in English vineyards. Along with Pinot Meunier, the three varieties combined accounted for around 40% <b>of</b> <b>vines</b> planted, which appears to reflect a significant growth in interest in English sparkling wines. Other varietals used are Auxerrois, Seyval blanc, Müller-Thurgau, Reichensteiner, and Bacchus. To put that in context, the current yield for all types of English wine averages to around 2 million bottles annually.|$|E
25|$|Sprinkler {{irrigation}} {{involves the}} installation {{of a series of}} sprinkler units throughout the vineyard, often spaced as several rows about 65 feet (20m) apart. The sprinklers can be set on an electronic timer and release predetermined amount of water for a set period of time. While this provides more control and uses less water than flood irrigation, like furrow irrigation the amount that each individual wine receives can be sporadic. The irrigation system that provides the most control over water management, though conversely the most expensive to install, is drip irrigation. This system involved long plastic water supply lines that run down each row <b>of</b> <b>vines</b> in the vineyard with each individual grape vine having its own individual dripper. With this system, a viticulturist can control the precise amount of water that each grapevine gets down to the drop. An adaption of this system, potentially useful in areas where irrigation may be banned, is underground subirrigation where precise measurements of water is delivered directly to the root system.|$|E
