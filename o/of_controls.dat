40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the level of {{academic}} locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the students who study pre-school education program. The sample of study is 329 students selected randomly in Faculty of Education from a mid-sized state University. In the study, Personal Information Form and Academic Locus <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> Scale prepared by researchers were used. Academic Locus <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> Scale includes two sub-dimensions; internal locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and external locus <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> Independent samples t test was used to show differences between variables and sub-dimensions. According to findings, there is a significant difference between scores of internal and external locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> females and scores of internal and external locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> males. Whereas the average score of external locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> female is lower than male’, point average of internal locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> female is high. There is a significant difference between scores of internal and external locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> 1 stgrade students and scores of internal and external locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> 4 stgrade students. According to results, females find themselves in origin of success and males attribute the success to other causes.

5|$|Similarly, Susumu Tonegawa {{demonstrated}} in 1996 that the CA1 {{area of the}} hippocampus {{is crucial to the}} formation of spatial memories in living mice. So-called place cells located in this region become active only when the rat is in a particular location — called a place field — in the environment. Since these place fields are distributed throughout the environment, one interpretation is that groups of place cells form maps in the hippocampus. The accuracy of these maps determines how well a rat learns about its environment and thus how well it can navigate it. Tonegawa found that by impairing the NMDA receptor, specifically by genetically removing the NR1 subunit in the CA1 region, the place fields generated were substantially less specific than those <b>of</b> <b>controls.</b> That is, mice produced faulty spatial maps when their NMDA receptors were impaired. As expected, these mice performed very poorly on spatial tasks compared to controls, further supporting the role of LTP in spatial learning.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a gradual}} {{reduction}} in the number of locations allowed to mint coins in England; under HenryII, only 30 boroughs were still able to use their own moneyers, and the tightening <b>of</b> <b>controls</b> continued throughout the 13th century. By the reign of EdwardI there were only nine mints outside London and the king created a new official called the Master of the Mint to oversee these and the thirty furnaces operating in London to meet the demand for new coins. The amount of money in circulation hugely increased in this period; before the Norman invasion there had been around £50,000 in circulation as coin, but by 1311 this had risen to more than £1million. At any particular point in time, though, much of this currency might be being stored prior to being used to support military campaigns or to be sent overseas to meet payments, resulting in bursts of temporary deflation as coins ceased to circulate within the English economy. One physical consequence of the growth in the coinage was that coins had to be manufactured in large numbers, being moved in barrels and sacks to be stored in local treasuries for royal use as the king travelled.|$|E

We examined the self-esteem, internal health locus <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> and external health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> through sociodemographic and neurocognitive factors. Methods: Forty-six schizophrenic patients and 31 healthy residents from the community or hospital were recruited as the control group. All subjects participated in the self-esteem questionnaire, health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> questionnaire, {{and a series of}} neuropychological measures. Results: Multiple regression analysis revealed that inhibition of attention and external health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> were predictors for self-esteem (r=− 0. 30, P< 0. 05; r= 0. 41, P< 0. 01); inhibition of attention and external health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> were contributors for internal health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> (r=− 0. 43, P< 0. 01; r= 0. 61, P< 0. 001); and education was related to external health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> (r=− 0. 31, P< 0. 05). Conclusion: The current study integrated background characteristics and cognitive function to better understand the impact of self-esteem and health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> in schizophrenia. The findings indicated that inhibition of attention, external health locus <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> and education contributed to self-esteem, internal health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and external health locus <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> However, the overall predicted variance accounted for by these predictors was small; thus, further research is necessary to examine imperative variables related with self-esteem and health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> in schizophrenia.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and functioning in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) was investigated. The hypothesis {{was that an}} internal health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> {{would be associated with}} less impairment in functioning than other dimensions of health locus <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> Prior research undertaken into CFS has been inconsistent in its finding's and it continues to be an area of controversial interpretations. A repeated measures design was used, 74 people participated at the initial stage of the study and 67 people participated in the second stage. The Functional Limitations Profile was used to assess levels of impairment. The Multidimensional Health Locus <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> was used to identify types of health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> orientation, and the Shapiro Control Inventory was used to establish a clearer picture <b>of</b> <b>control</b> issues. Correlations and t-tests were used to investigate the {{relationship between}} health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and functioning. The results of these analyses indicated that an internal health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> was positively related to functioning. Multiple regression analysis was performed and showed that an internal health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> could successfully predict functioning measured at the second stage of the study. An unexpected discovery was that a doctor's health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> impacted negatively on functioning. The Shapiro Control Inventory revealed that the CFS sample fell within the normal range in the majority <b>of</b> <b>control</b> areas, but was outside the normal range in only six <b>of</b> the 23 <b>control</b> areas.

By discussing instances of skilful absorption from different cultural backgrounds I argue that the notion <b>of</b> <b>control</b> is not as closely related to self-consciousness as is often suggested.

The second is the view that losing this self-conscious type <b>of</b> <b>control</b> is a negative and upsetting experience. By focusing on “the paradox of control” in these experiences of skilful absorption, I argue that a feeling <b>of</b> <b>control</b> can occur without a self that narratively claims control.
