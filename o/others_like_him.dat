5|$|The {{story is}} {{virtually}} {{the same in the}} DS version, but with some major differences in the introductory sequence: Luneth goes to the Altar Cave alone, but while exploring he trips and falls into a hole created by the earthquake. He is then beset by goblins, and while he is frantically searching for a way out, he comes upon the wind crystal. It tells him that he has been chosen as a Warrior of Light, destined to restore balance to the world, and there are three <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> but before Luneth can ask it to elaborate, he is teleported to the surface. He returns to Ur, but Elder Topapa does not elucidate much on the matter. Going to a corner of town, Luneth finds his friend Arc being bullied by some of the kids. When Luneth intervenes, Arc runs away, heading for the village of Kazus.|$|E
25|$|P.B.S. Pinchback, {{who came}} from the North to serve here, and <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> were free men of color who joined the Union militia {{for the first time}} and {{distinctly}} for that cause. Most of the Guard soldiers were African Americans who had escaped from slavery and joined the Union effort. Some historians think the legend of continuity of the regiments was a propaganda ploy by Union General Benjamin F. Butler.|$|E

A student of the Christian missionary school system who assisted in the translation of the King James Bible into the Tamil language, he was influential in creating a period of intense religious transformation amongst Tamils in India and Sri Lanka, preventing large-scale conversions to Christianity.|$|E

25|$|Brunelleschi, and <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> {{developed}} {{a passion for}} the highly refined style of Roman architecture, in which the forms and decorations followed rules of placement and proportion that had long been neglected. They sought to rediscover and apply these rules. It was a time of architectural theorising and experimentation. Brunelleschi built two large churches in Florence demonstrating how the new style could be applied, San Lorenzo's and Santo Spirito. They are essays in the Classical, with rows of cylindrical columns, Corinthian capitals, entablatures, semi-circular arches and apsidal chapels.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prominent}} economic analyst {{of law is}} 1991 Nobel Prize winner Ronald Coase, whose first major article, The Nature of the Firm (1937), argued {{that the reason for}} the existence of firms (companies, partnerships, etc.) is the existence of transaction costs. Rational individuals trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective. His second major article, The Problem of Social Cost (1960), argued that if we lived in a world without transaction costs, people would bargain with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes. Coase used the example of a nuisance case named Sturges v Bridgman, where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move. Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor {{had to put up with}} it, they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of transaction costs may prevent this. So the law ought to pre-empt what would happen, and be guided by the most efficient solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe. Coase and <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his other teachings, {{he was able to}} teach a psychological test and measurement course. Because he loved the mathematical portion of the course, he changed the class to aptitude testing, which focused on scientific basis of vocational guidance. On the side, Hull also conducted research to build a machine that could perform all the correlational work for him automatically. After teaching the aptitude testing class, Clark went on to teaching an introductory class for premedical students. While teaching this class he particularly took notice of suggestion and hypnosis. This was the starting point of his experimental testing in this field in which Clark focused on the quantitative methodology in experimental psychology. After ten years of in-depth research, he wrote the book Hypnosis and Suggestibility in 1933. After writing the book, he decided to continue in experimental field by teaching this course in {{addition to}} the premedical course. Clark had a great desire to teach this course and felt as though this specific type of science was the foundation of true psychology. In 1929 he was called to the Institute of Psychology at Yale University as a research professor of psychology where he worked on the problems concerning systematic behavior theory. In 1930, he came to several conclusions about psychology: the first was that he believed that psychology is a true natural science. The second was that its primary laws are expressed quantitatively by moderate number equations and that all complex behavior or single individuals will be derived as second laws. The third was that the primary laws with the behavior (based on the condition) can also be derived as quantitative laws from the same primary equation. he and other psychologists (Neal E. Miller, John Dollard, and O.H Mower) looked into these ideas more, they sought to understand what underlined conditioned reflex and behavior while also seeking to understand Freud and <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> This eventually led to his work that he is primarily known for: Principles of Behavior.|$|E

60|$|The {{individuality}} of Hawthorne {{becomes apparent}} when {{we attempt to}} classify him,--a vain attempt, {{since there is no}} <b>other</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> in literature. In dealing with almost any other novelist we can name his models, or at least point out the story-tellers whose methods influenced his work; but Hawthorne seems to have had no predecessor. Subject, style and method were all his own, developed during his long seclusion at Salem, and from them he never varied. From his Twice-Told Tales to his unfinished Dolliver Romance he held steadily to the purpose of portraying the moral law against a background of Puritan history.|$|R

He participated in the Peninsula Campaign and chased the audacious Jeb Stuart's Cavalry that went completely around the Union Army (June 13–15, 1862). This caused great psychological concerns to the Union cavalry commanders and men. The [...] "horse soldiers" [...] were a far second best compared to the dashing Confederate cavalry.|$|E

[...] The judge saw the Look Tin Sing holding reaffirmed in the Gee Fook Sing case and noted further that another part of the Supreme Court's Slaughterhouse Cases opinion said that [...] "it is only necessary that [...] should be born or naturalized in the United States to be a citizen of the Union." [...] Concluding that the Look Tin Sing decision constituted a controlling precedent in the Ninth Circuit, Judge Morrow ruled that subject to the jurisdiction thereof referred to being subject to U.S. law (the first of the two proposed interpretations). [...] On January 3, 1896, the judge declared Wong Kim Ark to be a citizen because he was born in the U.S.|$|E
2500|$|According to Eliade's theory, {{only the}} Sacred has value, only a thing's first {{appearance}} has value and, therefore, only the Sacred's first appearance has value.

Sam does not like this status but begins to live with this fate, though shows no surprise towards its utterance. It is made clear by the demon Steve that Sam is perhaps the only person on Earth that the Devil talks with face-to-face, which raises suspicion amongst Sam and his friends. This suggestion is later disproved when the Devil introduces Morgan, a young man the Devil claims is his son.|$|E

[...] Kierkegaard wrote out of concern for his father's anxiety and <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> who believe that God shuts his door against them. He asks, “How does a person get to know that he is the greatest sinner?” Kierkegaard started in Either/Or with two characters known only as A and B, both were in search of a self, and he worked himself up to The Concept of Anxiety where he remarked; [...] "If a person does not first make clear to himself the meaning of “self,” it is of no use to say of sin that it is selfishness." [...] His father was only twelve when he cursed God and didn't have faith that God would forgive him. Goethe had the same problem because he had many experiences while he was still young.|$|E

Some, like The Night of the Following Day, I made only for the money; others, like Candy, I did because a friend asked me to and I didn't want to turn him down... In some ways I think of my middle age as the Fuck You Years." [...] Candy was especially appalling for many; a 1968 sex farce film directed by Christian Marquand {{and based on the}} 1958 novel by Terry Southern, the movie satirizes pornographic stories through the adventures of its naive heroine, Candy, played by Ewa Aulin. It is generally regarded as the nadir of Brando's career. The Washington Post observed: [...] "Brando's self-indulgence over a dozen years is costing him and his public his talents." [...] In the March 1966 issue of The Atlantic, Pauline Kael wrote that in his rebellious days, Brando [...] "was antisocial because he knew society was crap; he was a hero to youth because he was strong enough not to take the crap", but now Brando and <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> had become [...] "buffoons, shamelessly, pathetically mocking their public reputations." [...] In an earlier review of The Appaloosa in 1966, Kael wrote that the actor was [...] "trapped in another dog of a movie... Not for the first time, Mr. Brando gives us a heavy-lidded, adenoidally openmouthed caricature of the inarticulate, stalwart loner." [...] Although he feigned indifference, Brando was hurt by the critical mauling, admitting in the 2015 film Listen to Me Marlon, [...] "They can hit you every day and you have no way of fighting back. I was very convincing in my pose of indifference, but I was very sensitive and it hurt a lot." ...|$|E
