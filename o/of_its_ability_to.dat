5|$|An ectomycorrhizal species, S.pungens {{forms an}} {{intimate}} mutualistic relationship between its underground mycelium {{and the young}} roots of the associated host tree. The fungus—limited in distribution to California—fruits almost exclusively with Monterey and bishop pine, two trees with small and scattered natural ranges concentrated in the West Coast of the United States. Several studies have investigated the role of S.pungens in the coastal Californian forest ecosystem it occupies. Although the species produces more fruit bodies than other competing ectomycorrhizal fungi in the same location, {{it is not a}} dominant root colonizer, and occupies {{only a small percentage of}} ectomycorrhizal root tips. The fungus's propensity to fruit prolifically despite minimal root colonization is a result <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> efficiently transfer nutrients from its host for its own use.|$|E
5|$|Nakano {{organised}} {{the withdrawal}} of his force. He chose two routes, one following the coast and the other running along the ridge lines of {{the foothills of the}} Finisterres. Initially, the 20th Division was to take the coastal route while the 51st and some naval units took the inland one, but this was changed at the last minute and both divisions took the inland route. Additional rations and supplies were to be delivered by submarine. However, the 51st Division elected to move out rather than wait for the submarines and risk exhausting its rations through waiting. The 51st Division had experience crossing the mountains before, and Nakano was confident <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> negotiate them. In the event, one submarine was discovered by Allied aircraft and failed to reach its objective, while a second was discovered and sunk. A third got through but it was a small type that was only able to carry five tons of supplies, which were distributed among units of the 20th Division.|$|E
5|$|Panellus stipticus is one {{of several}} dozen species of fungi that are bioluminescent. Strains from eastern North America are {{typically}} bioluminescent, but those from the Pacific coast regions of North America and from other continents are not. The luminescence is localized to the edges of the gills and the junction of the gills with the stem and cap. Bioluminescence is also observable with mycelia grown in laboratory culture, and the growth conditions for optimal light production have been studied in detail. Several chemicals have been isolated and characterized that are believed to be responsible for light production. Genetic analysis has shown that luminescence is controlled by a single dominant allele. The luminescent glow of this and other fungi inspired the term foxfire, coined by early settlers in eastern and southern North America. Modern research has probed the potential of P.stipticus as a tool in bioremediation, because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> detoxify various environmental pollutants.|$|E

5|$|Rosendale is {{underlain}} by a shale {{member of}} the Martinburg Formation called Martinburg shale, deposited as early as 500 million years ago; Martinburg shale also lines {{the bottom of the}} Rondout Creek as it flows through the town. A conglomerate of the Shawangunk Formation was deposited over the Martinburg layer approximately 425 million years ago. The conglomerate is in turn covered by High Falls Shale, a reddish shale formed by mud flats. Subsequent streams left a layer of gray Binnewater Sandstone above the shale. After the sandstone was deposited, the region experienced folding and faulting, and was submerged in a shallow sea. This allowed the creation of fossiliferous limestone roughly 390 million years ago, specifically the Rondout Formation and New Scotland Formation. The Rondout Formation's dolostone member, formed during the upper Silurian, was mined throughout the village because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> form natural cement. The region experienced repeated glaciation, and large amounts of till and alluvium were deposited during the Wisconsonian glaciation.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} for monazite, which usually contains all the rare earths {{as well as}} thorium, is more involved. Monazite, because of its magnetic properties, can be separated by repeated electromagnetic separation. After separation, it is treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide to pH 3-4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that, the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths to their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes {{one of the main}} components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Lanthanum is separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. This salt is relatively less soluble than other rare earth double salts and therefore stays in the residue. Care must be taken when handling some of the residues as they contain 228Ra, the daughter of 232Th, which is a strong gamma emitter. Lanthanum is relatively easy to extract as it has only one neighbouring lanthanide, cerium, which can be removed by making use <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> be oxidised to the +4 state; thereafter, lanthanum may be separated out by the historical method of fractional crystallization of La(NO3)3·2NH4NO3·4H2O, or by ion-exchange techniques when higher purity is desired.|$|E
