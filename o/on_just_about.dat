25|$|Grouper are fish {{belonging}} {{to a number of}} genera in the subfamily Epinephelinae of the family Serranidae, in the order Perciformes. Species of grouper include the black, comet, gag, giant, Goliath, Nassau, saddletail, tiger, Warsaw, white and yellowfin grouper. Typical lengths are 80–120 centimetres. They inhabit depths from reefs near the surface down to over 400 metres. They feed <b>on</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> any moving animal they encounter. Groper are important inshore commercial fish, usually caught with gill nets (in earlier times longlines were used).|$|E

500|$|The Return of the King {{was criticized}} for its poor camera placement. [...] "What's {{the use of a}} new {{graphics}} engine and character models when the view is from so far away?" [...] asked Kato. Reed complained about [...] "camera switches which reverse the controls, or worse, completely obscure your viewpoint. <b>On</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> every mission the camera switching confuses the hell out of you." [...] The game's save function was also criticized. Ellis commented that [...] "You can only save after completing a level [...] which is not so good when you're forced to slog through the same sequences over and over again." [...] Critics also complained about the unskippable cut scenes, occasionally unclear objectives and relatively short length.|$|E
500|$|Keck's {{design has}} been widely criticized, often because of the catamount—Swiatek and Breen summed up the coin as [...] "an almost unrecognizably {{idealized}} Ira Allen, mated with an equally unrecognizably idealized wildcat. We cannot be sure of the species: cougar? panther? puma?" [...] Q. David Bowers described the reverse as bearing [...] "a large catlike animal of uncertain species, which {{had nothing to do}} with the history of Vermont being commemorated but was a rebus for the Catamount [...] Tavern, a subtlety lost <b>on</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> everyone who saw it". Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume about U.S. coins and medals, wrote that the Vermont coin [...] "is spoiled by an excess of lettering on both sides... It seems superfluous to have to state on the obverse that Ira Allen was 'Founder of Vermont'." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{focal point}} of reviewers' {{criticism}} was Dead Head Fred's gameplay, specifically the combat. [...] It was generally considered tedious and repetitive. [...] Australia's PAL Gaming Network described the combat as [...] "one of the poorest elements of the game", and Game Informer called the combat mechanics [...] "awful". [...] The performance of the camera was also criticized, with IGN noting [...] "Considering that the camera will sometimes choose some horrible angles for you in battle or during puzzles, it's annoying to have to fight {{it as well as}} mutants that want you dead." [...] GameZone said [...] "I just wish the camera wouldn’t be such a hindrance sometimes." [...] Reviewers were also unhappy with Dead Head Fred's loading times; Eurogamer considered them [...] "excessively high", and IGN said [...] "The only downside that crops up {{when it comes to the}} visuals are the continual loading times <b>on</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> every single area." ...|$|E

500|$|Super Mario Land {{is remembered}} for its {{miniaturized}} Super Mario elements and [...] "twist <b>on</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> every Mario mainstay imaginable". Many {{of its new}} elements did not recur later in the series, making Super Mario Land strange compared {{to the rest of}} the series, or what IGN's Thomas described as a [...] "singular oddball". IGN's Marc Nix felt retrospectively that Super Mario Land was the only uninspired Mario game, with [...] "funky voids of white" [...] and UFOs instead of the [...] "strikingly original" [...] Mushroom Kingdom. Mean Machines was also put off by the alien theme, easy difficulty, and dot matrix screen blur. IGN's Travis Fahs wrote that the game was comparatively not as [...] "ambitious" [...] as Super Mario Bros. 3. Mean Machines felt as if it was not [...] "a true Mario game", not worth its originally high review score, and [...] "in retrospect, not really a classic".|$|E
500|$|To {{proceed with}} the project, which Asus code-named [...] "Project A-Team", the company sent a design team to Google's {{headquarters}} in Mountain View, California, while Google sent seven engineers to Asus' headquarters in Taiwan. Having employees working in both locations allowed the engineering team to have a 24-hour development cycle, although Shih later needed to add 40 people to the project to meet Google's requests. The design for the Nexus7 {{was based on a}} tablet that Asus had showcased at International CES that year, the Eee Pad MeMO ME370T. An official explained, [...] "While the base design and setup was completed in the 370T to meet a certain price point and option list, the efforts required to get that design to $199 meant going {{back to the drawing board}} and starting over <b>on</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> every aspect of the unit." [...] Among the component modifications were a new motherboard, revised system on a chip (SoC), laminated display, and rear casing with a grippier material. The Nexus7's design was completed after a relatively rapid four-month development period; mass production began in May2012.|$|E
500|$|USA Todays Scott Bowles was {{critical}} of the film, awarding it 1.5 stars out of 4. He said that the film is [...] "heavy on bloody kung fu action...and light <b>on</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> everything else", that it [...] "doesn't have enough tension to be taken seriously, or enough laughs to be taken lightly", and called it [...] "slick and hip". Bowles wrote that the film has [...] "beautifully choreographed moments, and the action sequences won't disappoint any fans of slow-motion fistfights and arteries that gush like fire hydrants". Independent film critic Emanuel Levy wrote that Crowe's [...] "commanding performance" [...] and his chemistry with Liu lift the film slightly above the routine. Levy said that the film is an [...] "ultra-violent movie that blends thrilling martial arts sequences, orchestrated and executed {{by some of the}} masters of this specific milieu, with a semi-involving tale" [...] that would be appreciated by a young, indiscriminating audience. Leonard Maltin of IndieWire said that [...] "RZA's understated performance isn't bad, but his staging of action leaves something to be desired", and that the film imitates earlier kung-fu films, which it fails to improve upon.|$|E

500|$|The Philadelphia Inquirer {{highlighted}} Cyber Rights among [...] "1998's Best Reading", and concluded, [...] "Often reads, as Godwin intends, as a handbook for free-speech activism". A {{review in}} the San Antonio Express-News concluded, [...] "'Cyber Rights' is an extremely important book, one that anyone who accesses the Internet should read. Those who support the causes Godwin fights against aren't {{going to be happy}} with it, because he pokes some big holes in their arguments. But one of the bedrock freedoms we all enjoy is freedom of speech, and Godwin makes an elegant defense in its behalf." [...] The Dallas Morning News characterized the book as a multifacted legal instructive work, and commented, [...] "Part philosophical musings, part legal primer, part history and part political analysis, the book touches <b>on</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> every facet of how the Internet is transforming free-speech issues." [...] The Houston Chronicle wrote, [...] "Godwin makes a passionate case for ensuring the online world has the same civil rights as the 'real' world." [...] Writing in the book Internet and the Law, author Aaron Schwabach comments, [...] "The book takes an anticensorship position, but it presents all sides of the various questions fairly and completely." ...|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{and critics}} {{agree on the}} work's wide influence. Tom Shippey wrote that the essay [...] "was seized upon eagerly, even gratefully, by generations of critics". Alvin A.

[...] Seth Lerer wrote that the essay [...] "may well be the originary piece of modern Beowulf criticism. … The strategies … control the fundamental assumptions of Old English scholarship for the next fifty years." [...] R.D. Fulk commented that [...] "No one denies the historical importance of this lecture. … opening the way to the formalist principles that played such a vital role in the subsequent development of further Beowulf scholarship. … the methodology … remains a model for emulation.". Bruce Mitchell and Fred C. Robinson call it in their Beowulf, An Edition (1998) [...] "the most influential literary criticism of the poem ever written". George Clark calls it [...] "The most influential critical essay on the poem", stating it without qualification or justification as a known fact. Michael Lapidge similarly names it [...] "his widely influential critical discussion of the poem".|$|E
500|$|Twenty-six people, mainly police officers, {{were interviewed}} in 1998 {{as part of}} the {{subsequent}} PIC inquiry. Several witnesses from the party, as well as Webster, Wilson and NC1 were also questioned. The inquiry heard allegations that police assaulted four people during interviews: Webster, Wilson, NC1 and another unnamed suspect referred to as NC5, a relative of Webster who was 17 {{at the time of the}} murder. Admitting to the inquiry that he killed Leigh and insisting that he was alone in doing so, Webster stated that police repeatedly punched and kicked him when he refused to confess to her murder. According to Scott Tucker writing in The Newcastle Herald, police were also accused of threatening violence, falsifying reports and withholding evidence; one of the officers being investigated had his police locker raided by internal affairs, who discovered several records on the murder that had previously been listed as missing. Carrington was also summoned to give evidence, though she was not informed why; her book, Who Killed Leigh Leigh, which criticised police over their handling of the investigation, had been released earlier that year. Carrington was cross-examined for three days, longer than any of the police officers who were questioned, in what was described by Hillary Byrne-Armstrong as [...] "an inquisition <b>on</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> every word she had spoken [...] written" [...] in relation to Leigh's murder". Byrne-Armstrong accused the PIC of summoning Carrington for the sole purpose of attacking her credibility on issues they had no intention of investigating, and to discredit someone who had attracted considerable media attention for criticising police.|$|E

50|$|Goats are {{reputed to}} be willing to eat almost anything, {{including}} tin cans and cardboard boxes. While goats will not actually eat inedible material, they are browsing animals, not grazers like cattle and sheep, and (coupled with their highly curious nature) will chew <b>on</b> and taste <b>just</b> <b>about</b> anything remotely resembling plant matter to decide whether it is good to eat, including cardboard, clothing and paper (such as labels from tin cans).

500|$|While {{all forms}} of wild game were popular among those who could obtain it, most meat came from {{domestic}} animals. [...] Domestic working animals that were {{no longer able to}} work were slaughtered but not particularly appetizing and therefore were less valued as meat. [...] Beef was not as common as today because raising cattle was labor-intensive, requiring pastures and feed, and oxen and cows were much more valuable as draught animals and for producing milk. [...] Mutton and lamb were fairly common, especially in areas with a sizeable wool industry, as was veal. [...] Far more common was pork, as domestic pigs required less attention and cheaper feed. Domestic pigs often ran freely even in towns and could be fed <b>on</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> any organic waste, and suckling pig was a sought-after delicacy. [...] Just about every part of the pig was eaten, including ears, snout, tail, tongue, and womb. [...] Intestines, bladder and stomach could be used as casings for sausage or even illusion food such as giant eggs. Among the meats that today are rare or even considered inappropriate for human consumption are the hedgehog and porcupine, occasionally mentioned in late medieval recipe collections. Rabbits remained a rare and highly prized commodity. In England, they were deliberately introduced by the 13th century and their colonies were carefully protected. Further south, domesticated rabbits were commonly raised and bred both for their meat and fur. They were of particular value for monasteries, because newborn rabbits were allegedly declared fish (or, at least, not-meat) by the church and therefore they could be eaten during Lent.|$|E

[...] The importance of this and the pantheon of gods is seen in their stylistic representations <b>on</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> everything that the Huichol decorate. They did not have a written language until recently, so these symbols were and are the primary form of preserving the ceremonies, myths and beliefs of ancient Huichol religion.|$|E
