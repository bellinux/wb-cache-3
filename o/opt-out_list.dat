50|$|Canada's National Do Not Call List {{operates}} an <b>opt-out</b> <b>list</b> {{which allows}} consumers to register their wishes {{not to have}} telemarketing calls. Charities, newspapers, and pollsters are exempt although each of these is required to keep their own do not call list that consumers {{can be added to}} at their request.|$|E
5000|$|A Robinson list or Mail Preference Service (MPS) list is an <b>opt-out</b> <b>list</b> {{of people}} who do not wish to receive {{marketing}} transmissions. The marketing can be via e-mail, postal mail, telephone, or fax. In each case, contact details will be placed on a blacklist. Although the purpose of such a list is to reduce unwanted marketing, the principle that [...] "data is only private until someone decides it isn't" [...] indicates it can also generate unwanted marketing.|$|E

50|$|Like {{other social}} {{networks}} such as Hi5, Names Database {{has been criticized}} for being too aggressive at encouraging registrants to refer friends. Upon registration the site immediately asks you to refer friends and then checks the validity of any address you enter, attempting to disallow fraudulent information. However, free access to searching the database is granted in the email confirmation without referring any friends, thus skipping that step. Also, all outgoing emails appear to follow the rules stipulated in the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 including proper <b>opt-out</b> links, <b>listed</b> physical addresses and information about how the original email address was collected.|$|R
5000|$|The Debt Guarantee Program, as {{described}} in the Interim Rule, temporarily would guarantee all newly issued senior unsecured debt up to prescribed limits issued by participating entities on or after October 14, 2008, through and including June 30, 2009. (and thus the program would last approximately six months) The guarantee would not extend beyond June 30, 2012. The Interim Rule explained that, {{as a result of this}} guarantee, the unpaid principal and contract interest of an entityâ€™s newly issued senior unsecured debt would be paid by the FDIC if the issuing insured depository institution failed or if a bankruptcy petition were filed by the respective issuing holding company. Over 6000 entities have opted out of this program. DGP <b>Opt-out</b> <b>list</b> (.xls) ...|$|E
