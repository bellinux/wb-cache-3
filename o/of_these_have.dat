5|$|After her death, 116-year-old Marie-Louise Meilleur {{became the}} oldest {{recognized}} living person. Both {{before and after}} Calment's death, {{there have been several}} claims to have surpassed her age (see Unverified longevity claims), but none <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>have</b> been proven and Calment therefore continues to hold the record for the oldest verified person ever.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the small}} size of {{brachytherapy}} sources and low control in early decades, there is a risk that some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>have</b> escaped into the environment to become orphaned sources. A radium needle was found in a Prague playground in 2011, radiating 500 µSv/h from one metre away.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen other radioisotopes {{have been}} {{characterized}} with atomic weights ranging from 89.93 u (90Ru) to 114.928 u (115Ru). Most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>have</b> half-lives {{that are less}} than five minutes except 95Ru (half-life: 1.643 hours) and 105Ru (half-life: 4.44 hours).|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{several species}} were described. However, many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>have</b> since been {{considered}} to be invalid or synonymous with existing species, leaving two well-known and one poorly known species.

5|$|Lacaille gave six stars Bayer designations, {{labeling}} them Alpha (α) to Zeta (ζ) in 1756, but omitted Epsilon (ε) and designated two adjacent {{stars as}} Gamma (γ). Bode extended the designations to Rho (ρ) for other stars, but most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>have</b> {{fallen out of}} use. Caelum is too far south for any of its stars to bear Flamsteed designations.|$|E
5|$|Lexical {{differences}} between dialects are often considerable. This {{is due to}} the earlier cultural practice of imposing taboo on words which had served as names for a deceased person. Since people were often named after everyday objects, many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>have</b> changed their name several times because of taboo rules, causing dialectal vocabulary to diverge further.|$|E

5|$|The {{most stable}} {{radioactive}} isotopes are technetium-98 with a half-life of 4.2millionyears (Ma), technetium-97 with 2.6Ma, and technetium-99 with 211,000years. Thirty other radioisotopes have been characterized with mass numbers ranging from 85 to 118. Most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>have</b> half-lives {{that are less}} than an hour, the exceptions being technetium-93 (half-life: 2.73hours), technetium-94 (half-life: 4.88hours), technetium-95 (half-life: 20hours), and technetium-96 (half-life: 4.3days).|$|E
5|$|There {{exists a}} large number of {{commercial}} clones of Riesling, with slightly different properties. In Germany, approximately 60 clones are allowed, and the most famous <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>have</b> been propagated from vines in the vineyards of Schloss Johannisberg.

5|$|Acrocanthosaurus may {{be known}} from less {{complete}} remains outside of Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming. A tooth from southern Arizona has {{been referred to}} the genus, and matching tooth marks have been found in sauropod bones from the same area. Several teeth from the Arundel Formation of Maryland have been described as almost identical to those of Acrocanthosaurus and may represent an eastern representative of the genus. Many other teeth and bones from various geologic formations throughout the western United States have also been referred to Acrocanthosaurus, but most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>have</b> been misidentified; there is, however, some disagreement with this assessment regarding fossils from the Cloverly Formation.|$|E

5|$|Another 30 {{artificial}} radioisotopes {{of tungsten}} have been characterized, {{the most stable}} of which are 181W with a half-life of 121.2days, 185W with a half-life of 75.1days, 188W with a half-life of 69.4days, 178W with a half-life of 21.6days, and 187W with a half-life of 23.72 h. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 3hours, and most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>have</b> half-lives below 8minutes.

5|$|Bears {{in captivity}} have for centuries {{been used for}} entertainment. They {{have been trained to}} dance, and were kept for baiting in Europe at least since the 16th century.
