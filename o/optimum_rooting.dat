The {{objective was to}} regain inspiring knowledge for nowadays organic greenhouse cultivation. There is only few literature available on cultivation and rooting, and some more on fertilization. Many of the described old practices are replaced by other and more effective techniques which are practiced in organic greenhouses. The actual knowledge on manure and compost in relation to nutrient management is more extended. Still {{there is the question}} of soil structure, rooting patern and the <b>optimum</b> <b>rooting</b> depth. Summarized, deep rooting (50 - 70 cm) has advantages but it is not a precondition for success.

40|$|Summary We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} cutting water po-tential (Ψcut) on rooting of juvenile hardwood (dormant) and softwood (succulent) stem cuttings of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) propagated under varying substrate water potentials (Ψsub) and volumes of mist application. Mist treatment and Ψsub contributed to the Ψcut of unrooted stem cuttings. When Ψsub was held constant across mist treatments, mist treatment con-tributed strongly to Ψcut. Substrate water potential affected rooting percentage when mist treatment was sub-optimal or ex-cessive, otherwise mist treatment had a stronger effect than Ψsub on rooting percentage. Cuttings rooted best when sub-jected to moderate cutting water potentials (– 0. 5 to – 1. 2 MPa) during the initial 4 or 5 weeks of the rooting period. Cuttings experiencing either severe water deficit or no water deficit rooted poorly. We conclude that the rooting environment should impose a moderate water stress on loblolly pine stem cuttings to achieve <b>optimum</b> <b>rooting...</b>|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{standardize}} {{a protocol}} for the micropropagation and in vitro flowering of Ipomoea sepiaria (I. sepiaria), an important ethanomedicinal plant. Methods: The nodal cuttings were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with various concentrations of 6 -benzyladenine (BA) or Kinetin (Kn; 1. 0 – 4. 0 mg/L) {{alone or in}} combination with α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA; 0. 2 – 1. 0 mg/L) for shoot proliferation. For rooting ½ MS medium supplemented with indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) or NAA (0. 5 – 3. 0 mg/L) was used. When the 45 -day-old in vitro derived nodal cuttings were subcultured on MS medium supplemented with 3. 0 mg/L BA and 0. 5 mg/L NAA and various concentrations of abscisic acid (ABA; 0. 5 – 3. 0 mg/L), in vitro flowering was observed. Results: The highest shoot induction response in terms of percent cultures responding and number of shoots per explant was observed on 3. 0 mg/L BA and 0. 5 mg/L NAA.

40|$|Extending {{the season}} of {{production}} and improving the scheduling of ornamental crops are key commercial objectives for nurserymen. In some woody species, {{the period in which}} cuttings can be rooted successfully is transient, thus limiting the opportunities for scheduled production. <b>Optimum</b> <b>rooting</b> often occurs in early- to mid-summer coinciding with periods of active shoot growth. The relationship between this shoot activity and root initiation was investigated in Cotinus coggygria 'Royal Purple'. Shoot growth on stock plants was manipulated by altering the photoperiod or light quality. Results indicated there were seasonal effects on rooting, but the importance of shoot activity varied with harvest time. Cuttings harvested in August had high rooting percentages, irrespective of photoperiod, and despite shoot growth terminating in response to the short-day treatment. In contrast, by September, rooting percentage was highest in cuttings from plants under long-days, which had maintained greatest shoot growth activity. Cotinus shoots grown in vitro under 16 h days showed reduced shoot growth and increased rooting competence compared with shoots grown under 8 h days. Growing stock plants under polythene films, which altered the amount and quality of the incident light, influenced the rooting of cuttings harvested in August, but no consistent relationship with shoot activity was apparent. From a practical viewpoint, maintaining shoot activity late in the season may prolong the period for propagation by cuttings; but, from a scientific viewpoint, processes associated with an active shoot apex do not provide a complete explanation of seasonal variation in rooting...|$|E
40|$|High {{variability}} in rainfall together with high evaporative demand creates severe constraints for crop growth and yields in semiarid environment where sustainable food security is needed.   Crop research has, therefore, {{to focus on}} sustaining the competitiveness of production in these environments where optimal root architecture can be important in determining uptake and resource use efficiency of water and nutrients. The aim of this thesis was to identify variation in genetic by environment interaction amongst wheat cultivars in root system architecture and to establish on how it relates to water and nutrient acquisition and drought tolerance/resistance. Initial laboratory studies revealed variation in rooting strategies amongst cultivars.   This was followed by two soil bed studies and one field study, which investigated the association of rooting strategies with WUE, NUE and crop performance in the absence and presence of moisture stress (wet and dry) and of nitrogen (0 and 60 kg N ha - 1). Laboratory, soil-bed and field trials were conducted {{to test the hypothesis}} that selection of <b>optimum</b> <b>rooting</b> traits would improve WUE, NUE and production of wheat cultivars in dry semi-arid environments.   Results showed that wheat cultivars have two distinct rooting strategies, one with large root systems and fast extension and the other with small root systems and slow extension.   The enhanced resource acquisition strategy associated with large, rapidly extending roots was shown to be successful in all environments.   It resulted in fast earlier plant vigour, higher WUE, NUE and DM yield.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Dennettia tripetala Baker f. {{is a small}} fruit-producing tree, {{which both}} animals and humans depend upon for their survival. Consequently, {{there is a great}} {{pressure}} on the seed, which is the only alternative for its inexpensive propagation. Hence, the species has been rendered threatened in the forest. Based on this fact, this study examined the macropropagation of Dennettia tripetala in order to domesticate and ensure its continuous availability for human utilization. Materials and Methods: The propagules (cuttings) used for this study were collected on five year old mother trees in Oloruntele, Ondo State while the experiment was conducted at the Department of Forest Resources Management, University of Ibadan, Nigeria. Cuttings were prepared using two factors; indole butyric acid (IBA) concentrations (0 ppm, 1000 ppm, 2000 ppm and 3000 ppm) and nodal positions (upper, middle and base), set under a high humidity propagator and watered twice a day. The experimental design used was a completely randomized design and the replication was done twice. Data were collected on percentage rooting, number of root per cutting, ramets’ height growth, ramets’ collar diameter and ramets’ leaf number. Statistical analysis was done using ANOVA. Results and Conclusions: The <b>optimum</b> <b>rooting</b> was observed in 2000 ppm IBA treated cuttings (95. 50 %) and upper nodal cuttings (72. 39 %). ANOVA test shows that hormone concentrations and nodal positions significantly affected the rooting of D. tripetala. The study also showed that hormone concentrations and nodal positions do not significantly (p > 0. 05) determine the ramet’s height growth of the species, being that the ramet that had the highest height was 0 ppm (6. 11 cm) and middle nodal position (5. 96 cm). From the findings, 2000 ppm IBA hormone and upper node have been discovered to be the ideal hormone concentration and nodal position at which five year old D. tripetala cuttings can be best rooted and survive...|$|E

The rhizome and tuberous {{roots of the}} plant have been used extensively in India in indigenous medicine. Due to its multiple uses, the demand for Curculigo orchioides is constantly on the rise; however, the supply is rather erratic and inadequate. Destructive harvesting, combined with habitat destruction {{in the form of}} deforestation has aggravated the problem. The plant is now considered ‘endangered’ in its natural habitat.

In addition, a protocol for successful sterilization of C. asiatica explants prepared from field-grown plants highly exposed to fungal and bacterial contamination was determined. Results for sterilization treatments revealed that applying HgCl 2 and Plant Preservative Mixture (PPM) with cetrimide, bavistin and trimethoprim which were included after washing with tap water, followed {{by the addition of}} PPM in the medium, produced a very satisfactory result (clean culture 90 ± 1. 33 %) and TS 5 (decon + cetrimide 1 % + bavistin 150 mg/L + trimethoprim 50 mg/L + HgCl 2 0. 1 % + PPM 2 % soak and 2 mL/L in medium) was hence chosen as the best method of sterilization for C. asiatica. The synergistic combination of 6 benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) in concentrations of 2 mg/L and 0. 1 mg/L, respectively, in Duchefa medium compared with MS induced the most optimal percentage of sprouted shoots (93 ± 0. 667), number of shoots (5. 2 ± 0. 079) and nodes (4 ± 0. 067) per explant, leaf per explant (14 ± 0. 107) and shoot length (4. 1 ± 0. 67 cm).

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the potential of some indigenous fruit trees as high value crops for use as shade trees in cocoa farms and the interactions between the cocoa and the indigenous fruit trees {{with the aim of}} maximising productivity. A survey on farmers' knowledge on Theobroma cacao-Chrysophyllum albidum agroforestry in the Suhum-Kraboa-Coaltar District using a structured questionnaire revealed challenges in propagation of C. albidum and the need to address them. The study also showed that the use of indigenous fruit trees in cocoa farms could bring economic gains to the farmer. A range of pre-sowing treatments were evaluated to determine the most effective method to break the dormancy of C. albidum hard seed coats. The results of the investigation showed that mechanical scarification was the best treatment for mass and uniform germination of C. albidum seeds with a percentage of 73. 8 % Experiments were also conducted to optimise vegetative propagation of C. albidum. In this study the effects of leaf area treatments, IBA concentrations and propagating media were examined. The results showed that stem cuttings with 40 cm 2 leaf area on Sawdust medium gave <b>optimum</b> <b>rooting</b> with a percentage of 88. 5 %. A field experiment to study the interactions between the cocoa and indigenous fruit trees of C. albidum, Irvingia gabonensis and Oacryodes klaineana agroforestry was set up at Afosu in Ghana. The experiment showed that at 15 months, the species allocated varying percentages of plant resources to root, stem and leaves biomass. This showed the growth strategies of the various plants. From these early measurements, C. albidum showed the initiation of a tap root system which could be expected to be less competitive with cultivation with cocoa. An on-farm study confirmed little competition for soil water between T. cacao and C. albidum both in the wet and dry seasons. On-farm data collection enabled stocking of C. albidum fruit tree per hectare to be calculated based on series of allometric equations. The key recommendations for the study are optimal planting distances and density for different age and class sizes of C. albidum trees in cocoa farms as well as pruning of fruit trees and cocoa trees to increase percentage light interception for higher yield.

This {{study focused}} on {{optimising}} four types of in-vitro conservation methods, namely: 1), micropropagation, 2) in-vitro slow growth, 3) seed germination and 4) cryopreservation for selected endangered plant species indigenous to the Cape Floristic Region. It {{is one of the}} targets set by United Nations millennium development goals, to integrate different conservation measures in order to preserve plant diversity and mitigate losses of genetic diversity. Therefore this study uses Phalaenopsis hybrids as a trial species that can be studied for the conservation of endangered Disa and Eulophia species through micropropagation and in vitro slow growth. Also conservation attempts on Leucadendron and Mimetes species that occur in the Cape Floristic Region were attemted to increase population densities by increasing germination percentages using smoke. Furthermore, the study attempted to store seeds by assessing different cooling rates for optimising cryopreservation measures for effective conservation. The use of tissue culture to increase propagules especially critically endangered species in South African has proven to be feasible. For the trial hybrids, shoot and protocorm explants of Phalaenopsis Psychosis Pink X P. No. 1; P. Large white X P. Large pink; P. No. 1 X P. Large pink; P. Mini pink X Brighton belle; and the P. aphrodite formed clusters of protocorms and shoots when cultured on ½ strength MS media supplemented with 10, 20 and 30 gL- 1 banana extract or ½ strength Murashige and Skoog, (1962) (MS) media supplemented with peptone. Continuous protocorms formation could therefore be obtained by culturing endangered Disa and Eulophia shoots and protocorms on banana containing media.

In short-term {{studies with}} barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) seedlings, the <b>optimum</b> <b>root</b> temperatures for leaf expansion were 25 ° and 35 °C, respectively.

Extreme temperatures greatly decreased ion flux, particularly K+ and NO 3 −, to the xylem of detached roots of both species. Removing external K+ did not alter short-term K+ flux to the xylem in sorghum but strongly inhibited flux at high temperature in barley, indicating differences in the sites of temperature effects.

40|$|Management {{decisions}} about root zone optimization {{should not be}} limited to corn hybrid selection, because even triple-stacked hybrids with corn rootworm resistance will not produce satisfactory yields if soil structure or chemical properties limit corn growth or nutrient uptake. Growing high yield corn is possible without intensive tillage systems, as numerous studies have shown no-till yielding equal to chisel or moldboard plowing for corn following soybean. Although maintaining soil-test P and K concentrations well above critical levels is important to achieving optimum corn yields, strip-till corn has not yielded consistently higher when P and K fertilizers were deep-banded versus broadcast applied. The relative yield benefits associated with broadcast versus deep-banded application of these nutrients seems to be related to soil moisture availability in the zones of nutrient placement during growing periods when plants take up the majority of their P and K requirements. Corn roots and plant populations suffer when corn rows are positioned too close to anhydrous ammonia or urea ammonium-nitrate N sources incorporated to shallow depths. Precision guidance is very beneficial for optimum corn row positioning at least 5 inches removed from the N fertilizer zone following spring pre-plant N application at high rates. The primary way to improve stress tolerance (e. g. tolerance to drought, high plant density, or delayed nutrient availability) in corn plants of a given hybrid is to achieve <b>optimum</b> <b>root</b> zones for unimpeded growth in a given soil and climate situation...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The most {{important}} problems of farmers in arid and semi-arid regions are adequate nutrition, <b>optimum</b> <b>rooting,</b> emergence, establishment and optimal density, and ultimately plant yield. Using grain priming and mycorrhizal inoculation is effective strategies in these conditions. Priming can cause earlier growth of seedling, to increase emergence rate, emergence percentage, plant {{tolerance to drought}} and salinity stress, early flowering {{as well as to}} increase {{the quality and quantity of}} yield and nutrient absorption. Plant hormones such as salicylic acid and gibberellic acid can be used for priming. Regarding plant response to environmental stresses, salicylic acid, which is an important signal molecule, plays a key role in the regulation of several physiological processes such as growth and plant development, absorption of ions, emergence and photosynthesis. Gibberellic acid (GA 3) has been shown to be involved in many physiological processes such as cell division activity of meristem regions, increase the cell length, emergence speed, and emergence percentage, seedling growth in field condition, early flowering and yield. Mycorrhizal inoculation increases the availability of nutrients especially plant phosphorus, concentrations of plant hormones (auxins, cytokinins and gibberellins), chlorophyll content, the efficiency of biological nitrogen fixation, assimilates allocation to host plant organs, the changes of root structure, and improve soil structure. Materials and Methods: In order to evaluate the response of lentil to grain priming (without grain priming, hydro-priming, 100 ppm gibberellic acid, 100 ppm salicylic acid, 100 ppm gibberellic acid + 100 ppm salicylic acid) and soil mycorrhizal inoculation (non-inoculated control, inoculated with Glomus moseae and Glomus intraradices), a factorial experiment based on a completely randomized block design with four replications carried out in a greenhouse and research farm of the Gonbad Kavous University during 2013 and 2014. Various priming treatments - applied in the laboratory. Then, during planting, mycorrhizal inoculation treatment was kept in the closet place to the grains about 5 g per gram of grain (40 spores per gram). To determine the activity of roots (root length and number of nitrogen fixation nodes) 10 seedlings per pot were kept. Measured traits in the field condition were included the concentration and uptake of total phosphorus in aerial parts, concentration and total phosphorus uptake of grain, grain yield, and biological yield. Results and Discussion: Variance analysis showed that different treatments of mycorrhizal inoculation, priming, and their interactions had significant effects on the studied traits such as the root length, number of nitrogen fixation nodules, phosphorus concentration of aerial parts, grain phosphorus concentration, grain phosphorus uptake, biological yield, and grain yield. In this study the highest root length (39. 5 cm), nitrogen fixation nodules (114), aerial parts phosphorus uptake (12. 1 kg/h) were obtained under combined treatment of G. intraradices inoculation+ 100 ppm gibberellic acid.

40|$|Simulations {{of plant}} water uptake in soil science {{are based on}} the interplay between soil and root properties, with an imposed flux or water {{potential}} at the stem base. The dialogue between roots and shoots is important in water uptake. The threshold soil water potential for water uptake represents the soil water potential at which stomatal control stops transpiration over 24 h. Measurements show that it has a large variability among species and cultivars. Isohydric plants prevent low leaf water potentials via stomatal control, so their threshold soil water potential is high. Anisohydric plants allow low leaf water potentials, resulting in lower thresholds. These behaviors have a genetic control and can be simulated via whole-plant models. In studied species, the hydraulic conductance in roots and shoots depends on the whole-plant transpiration rate. In particular, there is a "dialogue" between the daily alternations in the transpiration rate and the circadian oscillations in root hydraulic conductance that affect the hydraulic conductance of the rhizosphere, with appreciable consequences on water uptake. Root traits such as length, branching, or depth interact with shoot traits such as leaf area or stomatal control, thereby generating feedbacks. As a consequence, <b>optimum</b> <b>root</b> systems for water uptake at a given time are not always those associated with the best yields. Models that take these whole-plant results into account bring an extra level of complication but are probably indispensable whenever the aim is to optimize root traits in view of improved drought tolerance...|$|R

The new procedure depends on published algorithms for the dependence of growth rate and optimal plant nutrient concentrations on shoot dry weight Ws (g m– 2), and on measuring evapotranspiration rates and shoot dry weights at weekly intervals. Pansy, Viola tricola ‘Universal plus yellow’ and petunia, Petunia hybrida ‘Multiflora light salmon vein’ were grown in four independent experiments with the expected optimum nutrient concentration and fractions of the <b>optimum.</b> <b>Root</b> and shoot weights were measured during growth. KEY RESULTS: For each level of nutrient supply Ws increased with time (t) in days, according to the equation DeltaWs/Deltat=K 2 Ws/(100 +Ws) in which the growth rate coefficient (K 2) remained approximately constant throughout growth. The value of K 2 for the optimum treatment was defined by incoming radiation and temperature. The value of K 2 for each sub-optimum treatment relative to that for the optimum treatment was logarithmically related to the sub-optimal nutrient supply. Provided the aerial environment was optimal, Rsb/RoapproxWo/Wsb where R is the root : shoot ratio, W is the shoot dry weight, and sb and o indicate sub-optimum and optimum nutrient supplies, respectively. Sub-optimal nutrient concentrations also depressed shoot growth without appreciably affecting root growth when the aerial environment was non-limiting. CONCLUSION: The new procedure can predict the effects of nutrient supply, incoming radiation and temperature on the time course of shoot growth and the root : shoot ratio for a range of growing conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{utilisation}} of eucalypts {{around the}} world is increasing, mainly through the development of plantations. Clonal propagation has become important in some countries for production of such plantation trees. Micropropagation has been utilised to produce clones of trees selected for specific characteristics such as disease resistance, salt tolerance and fast growth rates. However, a suitable micropropagation protocol for all eucalypts has not been produced. One component of the micropropagation protocol, in which there is considerable difficulty, is the induction of adventitious roots on micropropagated shoots. Of particular interest, is the development of these procedures for Eucalyptus marginata (Jarrah) that have been selected for dieback (Phytophthora cinnamomi. Rands.) resistance. The effect of different sugar sources was examined on the rooting of jarrah shoots. Sucrose, glucose and fructose were all effective in promoting roots on jarrah in vitro. The effectiveness of each sugar varied between clones. In particular, three clones produced higher rooting on a medium containing fructose. For two of these clones the increase was as high as 30 %. Interactions between auxin, sugar and ethylene were examined. <b>Optimum</b> <b>root</b> induction was obtained when approximately 10 µM of auxin (indole butyric acid) and 2 % sugar (sucrose or fructose) was used in the medium. As auxin and sugar concentration in the medium increased, the amount of ethylene produced also increased. Similarly, this increase in auxin, sugar and ethylene reduced the chlorophyll content of the shoots. The use of fructose appeared to produce lower amounts of ethylene than sucrose when used at the same concentration. The ethylene produced seemed to have no effect on the rooting response. The increases in rooting provided in some clones may be applicable to other clones that are difficult to root. This may lead to more efficient micropropagation with more clones being able to be produced in large numbers. This will increase the genetic diversity of clones that is currently available for jarrah breeding programs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Maximum {{likelihood}} (ML) data aided channel estimation for wavelet packets based ultra wideband (WP-UWB) transmissions is investigated. Training pilot {{symbols are}} employed for ML channel estimation {{based on a}} least square algorithm derived from the optimum ML approach. An optimum training sequences criterion is derived. Based on this, nearly <b>optimum</b> perfect <b>root</b> of unity sequences (PRUS) are tested and compared to Gold sequences and random sequences. In this estimation strategy, a generalized inverse of the training pilot symbols matrix can be pre-computed and stored in memory. Furthermore, PRUS allows to save the inverse matrix operation and so reducing {{the complexity of the}} ML estimator significantly. This technique is especially attractive for low data rate transmissions as in sensor networks because of its low complex implementation. Performance analysis results in terms of the MSE are provided. Trade-offs between performance and complexity are described as well. The investigated channel estimation algorithms for UWB channels offer flexibility, low complexity and robustness, making channel estimation fairly simple and effective. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} method for controlling an IGBT inverter (or any VSC inverter for that matter) is by vector current control. This control system {{consists of two}} cascaded control loops. One possible realisation of the outer controller is to control the DC bus voltage such that no more power is taken off the DC bus than is available. This creates a current reference, which is fed into the inner current controller. The inner current controller then regulates the current passing through the IGBT such that the desired power is dispatched onto the grid. Whilst most research treats the grid connection as a simple RL circuit, there is little consistency on the method by which the gains of the inner current controller are selected. Internal model control, modulus <b>optimum</b> and <b>root</b> locus methods {{are just a few}} of the methods used to find the gains. However, it is not clear which of these methods yields the best performance of the inner current controller. This work suggests that tuning on phase margin or manually tuning may not achieve the best results...|$|R

The regeneration {{abilities of the}} in vitro cultured explants were compared on media supplemented with several plant growth regulator combinations. No regeneration occurred on hormone-free media, and shoot production was similar in both genotypes when supplemented with benzyladenine. In the presence of naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), transformed explants were characterized by faster root regeneration and reduced shoot organogenesis. The <b>optimum</b> for <b>root</b> formation was the same in nontransformed and transformed plants, but the sensitivity threshold was slightly lower in the latter. The NAA inductive period was shorter (14 versus 22 h) with transformed tissue. Root neoformation occurred about 72 h earlier on transformed explants.
