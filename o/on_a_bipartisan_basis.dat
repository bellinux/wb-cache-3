40|$|The chapter {{analyses}} Italy's {{foreign policy}} towards the apartheid regime in South Africa {{in the period}} 1976 - 1990, from the Soweto uprising to the liberation of Nelson Mandela and the begininning of {{the transition to a}} democratic South Africa. The focus is on the debate and the deliberations taken by the main institutional actors (government, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Chamber of Deputies and Senate with their respective Foreign Affairs Commitee), while the role played by social actors like the anti-apartheid movements or the trade unions and by political parties remains in the background (and analysed in other chapters of the book). The study of official documents points to [...] main conclusions: (1) the link established by Italy <b>on</b> <b>a</b> consensual, <b>bipartisan</b> <b>basis,</b> between peace and security in Southern Africa and the domestic developments in South Africa herself; in such context Italy {{played a major role in}} the granting of development aid to the Front Line States as well as in supporting them diplomatically; (2) Italy tried to strike a balance between her proactive role towards FLS and European consensus; (3) while actively engaged in Mozambique and in the region, Italy was more timid in her policy towards apartheid, notwithstanding the pressure from the opposition in parliament and the anti-apartheid movement in society; (4) that was particulary clear as far as sanctions against the apartheid regime were concerned, Italy simply followed the consensus reached in the EU. In the end, the politica capital accumulated by Italy in the region thanks to her role in the peace process in Mozambique, has been almost entirely spoilt in the following decades...|$|R

50|$|Under the Commission Model, {{policy making}} and {{administrative}} powers {{were given to}} semi-independent commission {{rather than to the}} president.

Civil Service Commissions typically consisted of three to seven individuals appointed by the chief executive <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bipartisan</b> <b>basis</b> and for limited terms.

5000|$|In early 1983, the MTA {{announced}} that it was planning to electrify the Main Line from Hicksville to Ronkonkoma. As part of an attempt to speed commuting times through Suffolk County, they wanted to eliminate railroad service in Wyandanch after 108 years. Similar proposals were considered for Pinelawn and Brentwood stations. The LIRR believed moving the Deer Park station to Pineaire and eliminating the Wyandanch and Pinelawn stations would allow the faster electric trains to significantly reduce commuting times to Penn Station. The closing of the Wyandanch station would have meant that all LIRR trains would have sped through Wyandanch at speeds up to 90 mph. This angered and united disparate groups in Wyandanch, prompting civic groups to mobilize residents to protest any termination of railroad service in Wyandanch. Working <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bipartisan</b> <b>basis,</b> Senator Owen Johnson (R-West Babylon) and Assemblyman Patrick Halpin (D-Lindenhurst) convinced the MTA to maintain rail service in Wyandanch as well as Pinelawn. The LIRR agreed to add a fence along the tracks to prevent residents from crossing the tracks and touching the third rail, and built two steel crossover bridges at South 27th Street and at Deer Street, just east of the new station.|$|E
5000|$|After {{a week of}} {{evidence}} in the Royal Courts of Justice and another week of court being adjourned for a verdict to be reached, all three suspects were found not guilty of all charges and promptly freed. Lord Scarman criticised the police for their handling of the case, claiming {{that they should have}} put more emphasis on the fact that there had been no struggle, suggesting that Maxwell Confait had known his killer. In his final judgement, he declared all three of the young men [...] "innocent".The Home Secretary then ordered a further police enquiry into the case under Peter Fryer, of the Derbyshire Police, who later became Assistant Chief Constable of West Mercia. He made no arrests and the case remained unsolved.After the acquittals by the Appeal Court, Jenkins ordered a full enquiry. Sir Henry [...] "Harry" [...] Fisher (1918—2005), a former High Court Judge who later became President of Wolfson College, Oxford was chosen to chair it. His primary remit was to make recommendations about the Judges' Rules stipulating how police should treat suspects, particularly children and [...] "the educationally subnormal" [...] which was [...] "palpably in need of review". He only accepted the chairmanship, however, on condition that he should also be free to find any individual guilty of the crime on 'the balance of probabilities', which is the civil standard of legal proof. In spite of opposition from some civil servants, he was allowed to proceed on this basis.In his report, he made a number of recommendations to improve the ‘Judges Rules’. But he also found two of the defendants, whom Scarman had declared ‘innocent’ in the Appeal Court, ‘guilty on balance of probability’.Because this statement was potentially libellous, the report was, exceptionally, published as a “Return to the House of Commons” which made it immune from litigation in the courts of justice. Fisher’s conclusions led to the setting up of another enquiry, the Royal Commission of Criminal Procedure (1979-1981) which itself led to the enactment - <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bipartisan</b> <b>basis</b> - of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 and the establishment of the Crown Prosecution Service.|$|E
50|$|Jeffrey B. Pine (born January 10, 1955) was Attorney General of Rhode Island from 1993-1999. He has now {{recently}} been practicing in private law. Pine spent ten {{years as a}} criminal prosecutor in the Rhode Island Department of Attorney General prosecuting dozens of capital cases and high-profile homicides. Following the enactment of Rhode Island's Life Without Parole Statute in 1984, {{he was the first}} prosecutor to prosecute a life without parole case, in State of Rhode Island v. Raymond Lassor, who was convicted of three homicides in 1986 and was sentenced to Life Without Parole. Pine was elected Attorney General in 1992 and was overwhelmingly reelected in 1994, receiving 76% of the vote. As Attorney General, Pine established priorities for the Department in the areas of juvenile crime, consumer protection, domestic violence, senior protection, public corruption, health care, and multi-state public interest litigation. He oversaw the successful prosecutions of the Chief Justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court, Thomas Fay, who was convicted of Ethics Violations; the former Governor of the State of Rhode Island, Edward DiPrete, who was convicted of bribery; four-time serial killer Craig Price; banking crisis figure Joseph Mollicone and notorious killer Christopher Hightower. During his two terms as Attorney General the Department received numerous awards on the state and national level for its successes and achievements, including “The 1997 Elder Initiative Award” presented by the National Association of Attorneys General, recognizing the Department’s many achievements in the area of Senior Protection. Pine also {{was a member of the}} Executive Committee of the National Association of Attorneys General and served as Chair of the Eastern Region for two years. In 1993 Pine established a statewide Task Force to Prevent Violence in Schools and a Domestic Violence Task Force. He also chaired a Task Force to Prevent the Sexual and Violent Abuse of Children, which led the charge to improve the justice system’s treatment of victims of child abuse and sexual assault. He also introduced more than 40 pieces of legislation that were passed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bipartisan</b> <b>basis</b> in the General Assembly, strengthening the laws in the areas of victim’s rights, juvenile justice, domestic abuse, drunk driving and other public safety areas. Pine published a law review article on Juvenile Crime for the Roger Williams University Law Review and was cited as a national leader in the battle to end Domestic Violence.|$|E

50|$|According to an {{editorial}} in the April 26, 2011, edition of the Long Beach Press-Telegram, support to maintain Vernon's city status came from two powerful groups that were rarely allied: the business community (including the California, Los Angeles, and Vernon Chambers of Commerce) and the labor community (including the Los Angeles Federation of Labor and the Teamsters) joined together in the battle against Sacramento. Both groups acknowledged that Vernon needed a comprehensive political house cleaning, but both maintained its right to cityhood.
