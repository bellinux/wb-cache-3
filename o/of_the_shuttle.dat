5|$|After the ASTP {{mission was}} completed, Lunney became manager <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shuttle</b> Payload Integration and Development Program. During this period, it was {{anticipated}} that NASA's space shuttle fleet would be flying very frequent missions, and carrying commercial payloads {{as well as}} flying missions for government {{organizations such as the}} Department of Defense and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The payload integration program was responsible for determining how the various demands of these customers could be satisfied, and how mixed payloads could best be physically accommodated within the cargo bay <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle.</b> During these years Lunney also spent time working at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., as Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Flight and later as Acting Associate Administrator for Space Transportation Operations.|$|E
5|$|Flight day 9 {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} preparations for landing, and the landing itself. Atlantiss deorbit burn {{was performed on}} orbit 128 at around 11:00amEST (16:00UTC), leading to a landing at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, on Runway 33 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shuttle</b> Landing Facility.|$|E
5|$|One initial {{emergency}} flight abort (RTLS) sub-orbital test mission was canceled {{due to high}} risk. Many other planned missions were canceled due to the late development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle,</b> and the Challenger and Columbia disasters.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} full day in space, Ham and Nyberg {{completed}} a limited inspection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle’s</b> thermal protection system using the end effector camera <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle’s</b> robotic arm. <b>The</b> crew also installed the centerline camera and extended the orbiter’s docking system ring to prepare Discovery for arrival at the space station.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} focused {{inspections}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shuttle's</b> heat shield were conducted {{while it was}} docked to the ISS.|$|R
25|$|The payload {{doors were}} opened after {{reaching}} orbit followed by deployment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ku band antenna and activation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle's</b> mechanical arm.|$|R
5|$|In 1995, Russian-American {{interaction}} resumed {{with the}} Shuttle–Mir missions (1995–1998). Once more an American vehicle docked with a Russian craft, {{this time a}} full-fledged space station. This cooperation has continued with Russia and the United States as {{two of the biggest}} partners in the largest space station built: the International Space Station (ISS). The strength of their cooperation on this project was even more evident when NASA began relying on Russian launch vehicles to service the ISS during the two-year grounding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> fleet following the 2003 Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Apollo 1 accident which killed three astronauts in 1967, Congress directed NASA to form an Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) to advise the NASA Administrator on safety issues and hazards in NASA's aerospace programs. In the aftermath <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shuttle</b> Columbia accident, Congress required that the ASAP submit an annual report to the NASA Administrator and to Congress. By 1971, NASA had also established the Space Program Advisory Council and the Research and Technology Advisory Council to provide the administrator with advisory committee support. In 1977, the latter two were combined to form the NASA Advisory Council (NAC).|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s and 1980s {{decaying}} {{infrastructure and}} {{the withdrawal of}} subsidies brought {{the future of the}} line into doubt. As one of its last acts the Greater London Council paid for the replacement of two bridges on the line, allowing operations to continue. The centenary of the line in 1989 saw a renewal of interest and an upgrading of the trains between Chalfont& Latimer and London Marylebone station made commuting more practical, and usage of the line stabilised. The introduction of London Underground S Stock in 2010 led to the replacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> service with half-hourly through trains to and from London.|$|E
25|$|While {{the system}} was {{developed}} within the original cost and time estimates given to President Richard M. Nixon in 1971, the operational costs, flight rate, payload capacity, and reliability by <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> February 2003 Columbia accident proved to be much worse than originally anticipated. A year before STS-1's April 1981 launch, The Washington Monthly accurately forecast many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shuttle's</b> issues, including an overambitious launch schedule and the consequently higher-than-expected marginal cost per flight; <b>the</b> risks <b>of</b> depending on <b>the</b> <b>Shuttle</b> for all payloads, civilian and military; <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> a survivable abort scenario if a Solid Rocket Booster were to fail; and <b>the</b> fragility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shuttle's</b> thermal protection system.|$|R

5|$|The away team scans Armus' energy field, {{finding that}} when Armus engulfs {{the shuttle and}} speaks to Troi, expressing his remorse and pity, the field disrupting their {{transporter}} signals is weakened which could allow them to beam Troi and the pilot out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle.</b> After Armus toys with Troi by completely engulfing Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Captain Picard beams down to speak to Armus directly, sending {{the rest of the}} away team to the ship. Picard engages Armus in a heated discussion to discover its motive, which is to seek revenge on those that abandoned it on Vagra II. Armus is riled to a point where the energy field is dissipated enough, allowing for Picard, Troi and the pilot to be safely beamed back to the Enterprise. After destroying the shuttlecraft from orbit, Picard orders a quarantine on Vagra II.|$|E
5|$|After the ISIS agents reunite and Drake's mutinous crew {{agrees to}} {{surrender}} {{in order to}} prevent his death, Drake has a mental breakdown, declaring humanity to be doomed and killing himself with Pam's rifle. Cyril, startled by the sudden gunfire, opens fire himself, killing three people (one of whom was the only capable pilot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> other than Drake). To worsen the situation, Barry Dylan (Dave Willis) challenges Archer to fight him in space. Despite the rigorous taunting and demeaning from Barry, Archer ultimately declines his offer. After Archer makes an act of humility, Cyril aims the launches at Barry's jet, subsequently stranding him on Horizon. As the group nears the airstrip, Archer, who wishes to take credit for the landing, messes with the steering shift, causing the spacecraft to crash. Afterwards, every ISIS agent except for Archer is shown to be injured as a result, especially Ray, who is now paralyzed from the waist down (which he ironically had pretended to be earlier in the season).|$|E

5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of January 4, 1962, the three-car automated train began service, with a ceremony. The trains carried a stand-by motorman during the six-month trial period. The train had scheduled to begin service on December 15, 1961, but Quill threatened to strike all city- and private-owned transit in the city if the train ran. Under the new contract with the TWU, the NYCTA agreed to put a motorman in the train during the experimental period. While in its experimental period, the automated train was only operating during rush hours. In July, the test was extended for three more months, and in October the test was extended for six additional months. The chairman of the NYCTA, Charles Patterson, was disappointed by the automated shuttle train, doubting that the train could be operated without any transit personnel on board. Initially, the automation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> was expected to save $150,000 a year in labor costs; however, with one employee still required on the train, there would essentially be no savings. If the test succeeded, it was planned to automate the IRT Flushing Line, the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, and the Culver Shuttle. However, the NYCTA did not have plans to automate the whole system.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{receives}} a distress signal from a shuttlecraft returning Deanna Troi from a conference. They {{find that the}} shuttle has crashed on a desolate planet, Vagra II, and while they can find the life signs of Troi and the pilot, {{they are unable to}} beam the two to the ship. An away team beams down and discovers an animated pool of a tar-like substance, a malevolent life form that calls itself Armus. When Lt. Yar attempts to approach the shuttle, Armus hurls her back with a psychokinetic blast, killing her instantly. The away team is brought back to the Enterprise but the damage to Yar is too great for Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) to repair, and they are unable to resuscitate her. A second away team is sent to the planet. Armus taunts the crew members and maintains his grasp <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle.</b> During this time, Troi has communicated with Armus and learned that it is a physical manifestation of evil from the bodies of an ancient race, abandoned on Vagra II.|$|E
25|$|NASA {{on flight}} day 7 {{released}} the video captured by cameras mounted {{on each of}} Atlantis's solid rocket boosters showing the launch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle.</b>|$|E

25|$|NASA {{initially}} {{planned to}} withdraw Atlantis from service in 2008, as the orbiter {{would have been}} due to undergo its third scheduled OMDP. However, because of the timescale of the final retirement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> fleet, this was deemed uneconomical. It was planned that Atlantis would be kept in near-flight condition {{to be used as a}} parts hulk for Discovery and Endeavour. However, with the significant planned flight schedule up to 2010, the decision was taken to extend the time between OMDPs, allowing Atlantis to be retained for operations. Atlantis was subsequently swapped for one flight of each Discovery and Endeavour in the flight manifest. Atlantis had completed what was meant to be its last flight, STS-132, prior to the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> program, but the extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shuttle</b> program into 2011 led to Atlantis being selected for STS-135, the final Space Shuttle mission in July 2011.|$|E
