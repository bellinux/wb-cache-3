40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of the {{prefabricated}} routing track distribution on the area-efficiency of FPGAs. The first question we address is whether horizontal and vertical channels should contain the same number of tracks (capacity), <b>or</b> if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> density advantage with a directional bias. Secondly, should the channels have <b>a</b> uniform capacity, <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>an</b> advantage when capacities vary from channel to channel? The key result is that the most area-efficient global routing architecture is one with uniform (or very nearly uniform) channel capacities across the entire chip in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Several non-uniform and directionally-biased architectures, however, are fairly area-efficient provided that appropriate choices are made for the pin positions o...|$|R
60|$|Is {{a divine}} being compelled, Porphyry asks, {{to aid in}} these efforts, or is it only {{the soul of the}} seer, as some believe, which hallucinates itself, by the aid of points de repere? {70b} <b>Or</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> {{blending}} of the soul's operations with the divine inspiration? Or are demons in some way evolved out of something abstracted from living bodies? He seems to hint at some such theory of 'exuvious fumes' from the 'circle,' as more recent inquirers have imagined. The young appear to be peculiarly sensitive to vapours, invocations, and other magical methods, which affect the human constitution, and the young are usually engaged as seers. Hence visions are probably subjective. Ecstasy, madness, fasts and vigils seem particularly favourable to divination. Or are there certain mystic correspondences in the nature of things, which may be detected? Thus stones and herbs are used in evocations; 'sacred bonds' are tied (as in the Eskimo hypnotism and in Australia); closed doors are opened, the heavenly bodies are observed. Some suppose that there is a race of false and counterfeiting spirits, which, indeed, Iamblichus admits. These act the parts of gods, demons, and souls of the dead. Again, the conjurer plays on our expectant attention. Omitting some remarks no longer appropriate, Porphyry asks what use there is in chanting barbarous and meaningless words. He is inclined to think that the demon, or guardian spirit of each man is only part of his soul,--in fact his 'subliminal self'. And generally, he suspects that the whole affair is 'a mere imaginative deceit, played off on itself by the soul'.|$|E

Because children are interviewed on school days and nonschool days, and because some schools offer a feeding program and others do not, the dietary impact of the program is identified under mild restrictions. The empirical results confirm an intrahousehold flypaper effect; indeed, they indicate virtually no intrahousehold reallocation of calories in response to the feeding program. In poorer households, however, children's gains from the program appear to be "taxed" more heavily. CONTENTS Acknowledgments [...] . v 1...|$|R
