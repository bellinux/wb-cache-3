500|$|The last {{case where}} this {{punishment}} is, by some, {{alleged to have}} been meted out in 1734, somewhere in Saxony. [...] Another tradition, however, is evidenced from the Saxonian city Zittau, where the last case {{is alleged to have}} happened in 1749. In at least one case in Zittau 1712, a non-venomous colubrid snake was used. The Zittau ritual was to put the victims in a black sack, and keep it under water for no less than six hours. In the mean time, the choir boys in town had the duty to sing the Psalm composed by Martin Luther, [...] "Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir" [...] (From deep affliction I cry <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>you)</b> The punishment of the sack was expressly abolished in Saxony in a rescript dated 17 June 1761 ...|$|E
500|$|I {{will not}} go on to other matters without {{pointing}} <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> that I chose the present Ionic order, from amongst all others, in order to ornament and to give lustre to the palace, which Her Majesty the Queen, mother of the most Christian King Charles IX, today is having built at Paris ... The other reason why I wanted to use and to show the Ionic order properly, on the palace of Her Majesty the Queen, is because it is feminine and was devised according to the proportions and beauties of women and goddesses, as was the Doric to those of men, {{which is what the}} ancients have told me: for, when they decided to build a temple to a god, they used the Doric, and to a goddess, the Ionic. Yet all architects have not followed that , shown in Vitruvius's text ... accordingly I have made use, at the palace of Her Majesty the Queen, of the Ionic order, on the view that it is delicate and of greater beauty than the Doric, and more ornamented and enriched with distinctive features.|$|E

500|$|Harry Clork and Doris Malloy put {{together}} a 34-page treatment which Laemmle approved in April. The pair completed their draft on May 20, 1935. Whale had Dan Totheroh re-write the dialogue and the draft was ready for submission to the PCA on July 15. When Breen reviewed the draft, his objections centered on the excessive alcohol use. [...] "We take this opportunity of pointing <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> {{in regard to the}} matter of the treatment of drinking in this story, that, generally speaking, it is presented in a light, facetious, acceptable, amusing, and desirable mode of behavior. It is upon this that we feel rejection may be reasonably based." [...] A revised script with the drinking toned down slightly was submitted on July 24, the same day Whale started shooting. Remember Last Night? was budgeted at $385,000. [...] Whale inserted lines that made fun of horror pictures, a genre with which he no longer wished to be associated. Carlotta is shown jumping on a diving board flapping a towel and exclaiming [...] "Look, I'm Dracula's Daughter!" [...] and in another scene she says [...] "I feel like the Bride of Frankenstein!" [...] Shooting wrapped on September 14. Whale was nine days over schedule and $75,000 over budget.|$|E
500|$|Elgar was knighted at Buckingham Palace on 5 July 1904. The {{following}} month, he and {{his family}} moved to Plâs Gwyn, a large house on the outskirts of Hereford, overlooking the River Wye, where they lived until 1911. Between 1902 and 1914, Elgar was, in Kennedy's words, at the zenith of popularity. He made four visits to the US, including one conducting tour, and earned considerable fees from the performance of his music. Between 1905 and 1908, he held the post of Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham. He had accepted the post reluctantly, feeling that a composer should not head a school of music. He was not at ease in the role, and his lectures caused controversy, with his attacks on the critics and on English music in general: [...] "Vulgarity in the course of time may be refined. Vulgarity often goes with inventiveness ... but the commonplace mind can never be anything but commonplace. An Englishman will take you into a large room, beautifully proportioned, and will point <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> that it is white – all over white – and somebody will say, 'What exquisite taste'. You know in your own mind, in your own soul, that it is not taste at all, that it is the want of taste, that is mere evasion. English music is white, and evades everything." [...] He regretted the controversy and was glad to hand on the post to his friend Granville Bantock in 1908. His new life as a celebrity was a mixed blessing to the highly strung Elgar, as it interrupted his privacy, and he often was in ill-health. He complained to Jaeger in 1903, [...] "My life is one continual giving up of little things which I love." [...] Both W. S. Gilbert and Thomas Hardy sought to collaborate with Elgar in this decade. Elgar refused, but would have collaborated with George Bernard Shaw had Shaw been willing.|$|E

2500|$|The {{finding of}} {{backward}} Satanic messages has been explained as {{caused by the}} observer-expectancy effect. The Skeptic's Dictionary states that [...] "you probably won't hear [...] messages until somebody first points them <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Perception is influenced by expectation and expectation is affected by what others prime you for." [...] In 1984, S. B. Thorne and P. Himelstein found that [...] "when vague and unfamiliar stimuli are presented, [...] are highly likely to accept suggestions, particularly when the suggestions are presented by someone with prestige and authority." [...] Vokey and Read concluded from their 1985 experiment that [...] "the apparent presence of backward messages in popular music is a function more of active construction {{on the part of}} the perceiver than of the existence of the messages themselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nolan’s gesture was imprecise, {{and pointed}} {{not to the}} redoubts and the {{captured}} British guns but, it seemed — at least to Lucan and his staff officers present — to the Russian battery guarding Ryzhov's cavalry {{at the end of}} the valley. Seeing Lucan's confusion, Nolan could have explained what Raglan intended, perhaps making the link – if he himself knew of the connection — between the third and fourth order; however, taken aback by Nolan's insolence, Lucan refused further discussion, and rode over to Cardigan standing in front of his brigade. Both cavalry commanders knew the dangers of attacking down the valley. When Cardigan learned what was expected of his brigade, he questioned the sanity of the order as conveyed to him by Lucan: [...] "… allow me to point <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> that there is a battery in front, battery on each flank, and the ground is covered with Russian riflemen." ...|$|E
