5|$|Ermac plays a {{supporting}} role in the plot of Mortal Kombat X (2015), in which he remains loyal to Shao Kahn's successors to the Outworld throne, first Mileena and then Kotal Kahn as they fight for the realm's rule {{in the midst of}} a civil war. He ultimately sides with Kotal Kahn upon the revelation that Mileena is not the true heir to the throne, as she is a genetic creation and not Shao Kahn's biological daughter. Ermac joins forces with Kotal Kahn, Reptile, Erron Black, and Ferra/Torr, and during a battle between the Outworlders and Cassie Cage's Special Forces unit, he is immune to Kenshi's son Takeda's telepathy due to the cacophony of souls inside his body, but he is then beaten by Takeda. Near the conclusion, Jax's daughter Jacqui Briggs exacts revenge on Ermac for destroying her father's arms when she defeats him in combat. In his ending, Ermac returns to Shao Kahn's abandoned fortress in search <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> summoning him when his souls are suddenly consumed by a resurrected Shang Tsung, leaving Ermac in a weakened state. He additionally appears in the closing panel of Kotal Kahn's ending as one of Kahn's chosen warriors (with Reptile, Erron Black, Ferra, and Torr) who fight in Mortal Kombat every decade in attempt to regain Kahn's Outworld sovereignty from Raiden.|$|E
5|$|The final {{official}} designation, assigned in 1938, was PanzerkampfwagenI (M.G.) {{with special}} ordnance number Sd.Kfz. 101. The first 150 tanks (1./LaS, 1st series LaS, Krupp-Traktor), produced in 1934, {{did not include}} the rotating turret and were used for crew training. Following these, production was switched to the combat version of the tank. The Ausf.A was under-armoured, with steel plate of only 13millimeters (0.51in) at its thickest. The tank had several design flaws, including suspension problems, which made the vehicle pitch at high velocities, and engine overheating. The driver was positioned inside the chassis and used conventional steering levers to control the tank, while the commander was positioned in the turret where he also acted as gunner. The two crewmen could communicate by means <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> tube. Machine gun ammunition was stowed in five bins, containing various numbers of 25-round magazines. 1,190 of the Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf. A were built in three series (2.-4./LaS). Further 25 were built as command tanks.|$|E

30|$|Another {{important}} part of the voice timbre differences between male and female voices seems to be the voice source: major difference is primarily in the amplitude of the fundamental.

25|$|John Coates (29 June 1865 – 16 August 1941) was {{a leading}} English tenor, who sang in opera and oratorio and on the concert platform. His {{repertoire}} ranged from Bach and Purcell to contemporary works, and embraced the major heldentenor roles in Richard Wagner's operas. For more than 40 years, with only a four-year interruption for military service during World War I, he overcame the limitations <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> that was not naturally large by impressing listeners with his intense artistic expression, lively diction, musical versatility and memorable stage presence.|$|E
25|$|The {{party was}} {{the brainchild of}} a group of discontented Western {{interest}} groups who were upset with the PC government and the lack <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> for Western concerns at the national level. Leading figures in this movement included Ted Byfield, Stan Roberts, Francis Winspear, and Preston Manning. A major intellectual impetus at the time was provided by Peter Brimelow's 1986 book, The Patriot Game. They believed the West needed its own party if it was to be heard. Their main complaints against the Mulroney government were its alleged favouritism towards Quebec, lack of fiscal responsibility, and a failure to support a program of institutional reform (for example, of the Senate). The roots of this discontent lay mainly in their belief that a package of proposed constitutional amendments, called the Meech Lake Accord, failed {{to meet the needs of}} Westerners and Canadian unity overall.|$|E
25|$|Timbre is {{perceived}} as the quality of different sounds (e.g. the thud of a fallen rock, the whir of a drill, the tone of a musical instrument or the quality <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice)</b> and represents the pre-conscious allocation of a sonic identity to a sound (e.g. “it’s an oboe!"). This identity is based on information gained from frequency transients, noisiness, unsteadiness, perceived pitch and the spread and intensity of overtones in the sound over an extended time frame. The way a sound changes over time (see figure 4) provides {{most of the information}} for timbre identification. Even though a small section of the wave form from each instrument looks very similar (see the expanded sections indicated by the orange arrows in figure 4), differences in changes over time between the clarinet and the piano are evident in both loudness and harmonic content. Less noticeable are the different noises heard, such as air hisses for the clarinet and hammer strikes for the piano.|$|E

25|$|Alexander Graham Bell {{obtained}} a patent in 1876 to {{a device that}} could transmit and reproduce the sound <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> over electrical cables. Bell realized the enormous potential for his telephone and formed the Bell Telephone Company which would control the whole system from the manufacture the telephones and exchange equipment to leasing the equipment to customers and operators. Between 1877 and 1893 (the term of Bell's patent coverage) the number of phones leased by Bell's company increased from 3,000 to 260,000, although these were largely limited to businesses and government offices that could afford the relatively high rates. After the Bell patents expired, thousands of independent operators became incorporated and their competition for services to middle and low-class households as well as rural farmers drove prices down significantly. By 1920, there were 13 million phones in the United States providing service to 39 percent of all farm households and 34 percent of non-farm households.|$|E

500|$|The term sexual {{inversion}} implied {{gender role}} reversal. Female inverts were, {{to a greater}} or lesser degree, inclined to traditionally male pursuits and dress; according to Krafft-Ebing, they had a [...] "masculine soul". Krafft-Ebing believed that the most extreme inverts also exhibited reversal of secondary sex characteristics; Ellis's research had not demonstrated any such physical differences, but he devoted a great deal of study to the search for them. The idea appears in The Well in Stephen's unusual proportions at birth and in the scene set at Valerie Seymour's salon, where [...] "the timbre <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice,</b> the build of an ankle, the texture of a hand" [...] reveals the inversion of the guests.|$|E

Angelou has supported Gillespie, telling an interviewer in 1983 that she wrote poetry so that it would be read aloud. Critic Harold Bloom, although he calls Angelou's poetry [...] "popular poetry" [...] and states that it [...] "makes no formal or cognitive demands upon the reader", compares her poems to musical forms such as country music and ballads. He characterizes her poems as having a social rather than aesthetic function, [...] "particularly in an era totally dominated by visual media". Sylvester, who says that Angelou [...] "has an uncanny ability to capture the sound <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> on a page", places her poems, especially the ones in Diiie, in the [...] "background of black rhythms". Chad Walsh, reviewing Diiie in Book World, calls Angelou's poems [...] "a moving blend of lyricism and harsh social observation".

500|$|In {{the decade}} after Britten's death, his {{standing}} as a composer in Britain was {{to some extent}} overshadowed by that of the still-living Tippett. The film-maker Tony Palmer [...] thought that Tippett's temporary ascendancy {{might have been a}} question of the two composers' contrasting personalities: Tippett had more warmth and had made fewer enemies. In any event this was a short-lived phenomenon; Tippett adherents such as the composer Robert Saxton soon rediscovered their enthusiasm for Britten, whose audience steadily increased during the final years of the 20th century. Britten has had few imitators; Brett describes him as [...] "inimitable, possessed <b>of...</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> and sound too dangerous to imitate". Nevertheless, after his death Britten was lauded by the younger generation of English composers to whom, in the words of Oliver Knussen, he became [...] "a phenomenal father-figure". Brett believes that he affected every subsequent British composer to some extent: [...] "He is a key figure in the growth of British musical culture {{in the second half of}} the 20th century, and his effect on everything from opera to the revitalization of music education is hard to overestimate." ...|$|E

Neil Strauss of The New York Times felt all the songs on the album [...] "cohere better than a greatest-hits package would" [...] and [...] "they tell a story of their own, <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> and attitude that have hardened in the dozen years that have elapsed between the bubble-gum-chomping innocence of 1983's 'Crazy for You' and the tortured torch singing of the new 'You'll See'." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly commented: [...] "By placing her greatest-hit ballads ('Live to Tell', 'Crazy for You', 'Take a Bow', etc.) in a new context—that is, separated from her more attention-getting dance music—Madonna reinvigorates them, which is just what a good best-of compilation is supposed to do. The three new songs 'You'll See', 'One More Chance', and a wonderfully eerie version of Marvin Gaye's 'I Want You' are consumer enticements that just add to the allure." ...|$|E
