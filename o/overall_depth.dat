500|$|The English {{localization}} of Final Fantasy IV {{retains the}} storyline, graphics, and {{sound of the}} original, but the developers significantly reduced the difficulty for beginning gamers. Square were worried that western fans would {{find it difficult to}} adjust to the game's complexity due to not having played the previous two entries, so decreased the <b>overall</b> <b>depth</b> considerably. Other changes include the removal of overt Judeo-Christian religious references and certain potentially objectionable graphics. For example, the magic spell [...] "Holy" [...] was renamed [...] "White", and all references to prayer were eliminated; the Tower of Prayers in Mysidia was renamed the Tower of Wishes. Direct references to death were also omitted, although several characters clearly die {{during the course of the}} game.

At the Smithsonian, the bones were analyzed but the species from which they originated was incorrectly identified.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of tissue optical properties on laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) {{is not well}} understood.

30|$|Special {{techniques}} {{discussed in}} an earlier section of this paper were used for modeling beam-to-column joints in frames {{to account for the}} additional strength resulting from confinement effects. As shown in Fig.  6 c, concrete within the gross cross section at the beam-to-column joint was modeled as highly confined and the area of the reinforcing steel in this region was doubled for the purpose of modeling. The concrete within the gross cross section in end portions of the column (from the face of the beam or {{from the top of the}} column to a distance equal to the <b>overall</b> column <b>depth)</b> and in end portions of beams (from the face of the column to a distance equal to the <b>overall</b> beam <b>depth)</b> was modeled as partially confined.

40|$|Dust {{infrared}} emission possesses scaling {{properties that}} yield powerful results with far reaching observational consequences. Scaling was first noticed by Rowan-Robinson for spherical shells and is shown {{here to be}} a general property of dust emission in arbitrary geometries. Overall luminosity is never an input parameter of the radiative transfer problem, spectral shape is the only relevant property of the heating radiation when the inner boundary of the dusty region is controlled by dust sublimation. Similarly, the absolute scales of densities and distances are irrelevant; the geometry enters only through angles, relative thicknesses and aspect ratios, and the actual magnitudes of densities and distances enter only through one independent parameter, the <b>overall</b> optical <b>depth.</b> That is, {{as long as the}} <b>overall</b> optical <b>depth</b> stays the same, the system dimensions can be scaled up or down by an arbitrary factor without any effect on the radiative transfer problem.

40|$|Infrared imaging {{properties}} of dusty winds around late-type stars are investigated in detail, employing a self-consistent model that couples the {{equations of motion}} and radiative transfer. Because of general scaling properties, the angular profiles of surface brightness are self-similar. In any given star, the profile shape is determined essentially by <b>overall</b> optical <b>depth</b> at each wavelength and it is self-similarly scaled {{by the size of}} the dust condensation zone. We find that mid-IR is the best wavelength range to directly measure the angular size of this zone, and from IRAS data we identify the 15 best candidates for such future observations. We also show that the visibility function at short wavelengths (< 2 microns) directly determines the scattering optical depth, and produce theoretical visibility curves for various characteristic wavelengths and the entire parameter range relevant to late-type stars. The infrared emission should display time variability because of cyclical changes in <b>overall</b> optical <b>depth,</b> reflecting luminosity-induced movement of the dust condensation point. Calculations of the wavelength dependence of photometric amplitudes and time variability of envelope sizes are in agreement with observations; envelopes are bigger and bluer at maximum light...|$|R

40|$|Plio-Pleistocene {{aggradation}} and progradation {{has resulted}} in the rapid outbuilding of the continental shelf margin, northern Taranaki Basin. Seismic reflection profiles reveal that this outbuilding is characterised by bold clinoforms which offlap in a basinward direction. This stacked succession of clinoforms, collectively termed the Giant Foresets Formation, obtains thicknesses of over 2 km in places, and has had a significant effect on the thermal regime of the region. This integrated study was initiated to document the Late Neogene evolution of this formation, and thereby gain insights on sedimentary distribution patterns, timing of sedimentation, and controls on progradation and aggradation. Latest Miocene extension in the northern Taranaki Basin, related to rotation of the Hikurangi subduction zone, greatly influenced sedimentation patterns in the Pliocene. Palinspastic reconstruction shows that initial extension of the Northern Graben occurred before Giant Foresets Formation sedimentation began. Sediment, sourced from erosion to the east, was preferentially funneled into the newly created Northern Graben during the late Miocene and early Pliocene, while areas to the north and west underwent a period of sediment starvation. During the late Pliocene, and into the Pleistocene, sediment accumulation outpaced graben extension, {{and by the end of}} the Mangapanian, the graben was overtopped. During this period, the progradational front associated with the outbuilding of the continental shelf-slope margin advanced northwards.
