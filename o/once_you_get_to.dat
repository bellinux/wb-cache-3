That's because we had all this animation in the neck and all this animation in the face, but the clothes don't move. <b>Once</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the level that people can actually see that level of realism, then people expect to see clothes moving {{and the rest of the}} body moving in a way we can't replicate in video games." [...] In the same interview McNamara also responded to queries about why Phelps sometimes responds with particularly aggressive lines of dialogue during interrogation scenes. [...] "It's funny. A lot of people say Aaron turns into a psycho. When we originally wrote the game the questions you asked were coax, force and lie. It was actually force because it was a more aggressive answer. That's the way we recorded it. But when the game came out it was truth, doubt or lie. Everyone always says Aaron on the second question is a psycho. So that's not his fault." ...|$|E

Writing for the Transylvanian readership of Luceafărul, in May 1909, George Murnu contended: [...] "Teodorescu Sion is a new talent that ought to work hard before reaching the profundity of observation which makes one an artist. He is altogether too preoccupied with technical matters and too superficial in his drawing." [...] Five years later, Tăslăuanu was to assess: [...] "Mr. Theodorescu-Sion's art [...] doesn't agree with all people on first impression. [...] The primitive and decorative genre, with simple lines and expressive planes, has not won [...] many adherents. His way of seeing and rendering things seen relates him to the modern art of other countries."
