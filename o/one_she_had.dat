After 2002, Song continued to make guest appearances in American situation comedies such as That's So Raven and One on <b>One.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> a recurring role as Tia in the Disney Channel series Phil of the Future, appearing in seven episodes of the series in 2004 and 2005.|$|E
5|$|Garland's {{history with}} CBS {{prior to the}} series was a {{checkered}} <b>one.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> previously headlined several specials for the network. The first was the inaugural episode of the Ford Star Jubilee which aired in 1955. The special, the first full-scale color telecast on CBS, was a ratings triumph, garnering a 34.8 Nielsen rating. This success led to Garland's signing a three-year, $300,000 contract with the network. Only a single special aired, a live General Electric Theater episode in 1956, before the pact was terminated. The relationship between CBS and Garland and her then-husband and manager, Sid Luft, dissolved in acrimony in 1957 after they and agent Freddie Fields were unable {{to come to terms}} with the network over the format of her next special. Garland filed a US$1.4 million lawsuit against CBS for libel and breach of contract (CBS filed a counterclaim) that was not settled until 1961, when Garland and CBS each agreed to drop their claims and negotiations began for a new round of Garland specials for the network.|$|E

25|$|The {{programme}} has {{its roots}} firmly in the desire of Doctor Who producer John Nathan-Turner to get Elisabeth Sladen back into the TARDIS. He had wanted her to have the contract eventually awarded to Janet Fielding in late 1980. John Nathan-Turner's preferred plan for the transition from Baker to Davison was to have Sarah Jane be {{along for the ride}} from Logopolis to the second story of series 19. However, Sladen had no interest in returning simply to reprise a role and function identical to the <b>one</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> left years before.|$|E
25|$|Other musicians, such as Pink and Gwen Stefani, were advertised and {{scheduled}} {{to perform on}} the show, but neither of their performances were aired. Although their numbers were pre-taped {{along with the other}} guests', American Idol claimed they were not broadcast due to time constraints, but that their appearances will be featured in future episodes of the show. Gwen Stefani sang during the season finale, however it was a performance aired via satellite, and not the <b>one</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> pre-recorded for Idol Gives Back. Pink's performance was shown on one of the later episodes of the season.|$|E
25|$|Although the Animal Bioscience Building was {{the first}} {{building}} constructed during Cruzado's tenure, it was <b>one</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> little to do with. In 1997, the Montana Land Board sued MSU, arguing that the university sold at below-market value or used for non-intended purposes land bequeathed to the university by Bozeman area farmers and ranchers. In 1999, the Land Board reached a settlement with MSU which, in part, required the university to set aside $3 million by 2005 to build a livestock research center. More than $13 million was earmarked by Congress {{over the next few}} years to build the structure. Additional fundraising also occurred, and more than 141 individuals gave more than $10,000 each to fund construction of the new center. The Wanke family of Rudyard, Montana, gave $2.7 million in honor of Harold Wanke (who always wanted to be a veterinarian but never got the chance). Construction began on the , $15.7 million building in 2008, and was complete in November 2010.|$|E

25|$|In 1884 Van and Ada, age 14 and 12, fall passionately in love, {{and their}} affair {{is marked by}} a {{powerful}} sense of romantic eroticism. The book opens with their discovery that they are in fact not cousins but brother and sister. The passage is notoriously difficult, more so as neither of them explicitly states the conclusion they have drawn (treating it as obvious), and it is only referred to in passing later in the text. Although Ada's mother keeps a wedding photo dated August 1871, eleven months before her birth, they find in a box in the attic a newspaper announcement dating the wedding to December 1871; and furthermore that Dan had been abroad since that spring, as proved by his extensive filmreels. Hence he is not Ada's father. Furthermore, they find an annotated flower album kept by Marina in 1869–70 which indicates, very obliquely, that she was pregnant and confined to a sanatorium {{at the same time as}} Aqua; that 99 orchids were delivered to Marina, from Demon, on Van's birthday; and that Aqua had a miscarriage in a skiing accident. It later transpires that Marina gave the child to her sister to replace the <b>one</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> lost—so she is in fact Van's mother—and that her affair with Demon continued until Ada's conception. This makes Lucette (Dan and Marina's child) the uterine half-sister of both of them.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the early}} turning points for the {{character}} came in season one's [...] "X-Ray", when Lana discovers information about her parents that changes her perspective on them. It began with her mother's graduation speech, which showed {{that her mother was}} not as happy as her aunt had led her to believe. Lana's perception of her mother drove the way she led her own life, which was based on the idea of everyone perceiving her in a good light. In season two, Lana discovers that her mother had had an affair with a man named Henry Small, and that he was her biological father. This continued the idea established in season one that Lana's perception that her parents were this perfect couple was wrong. According to Kreuk, meeting her biological father allowed the character to realize that she had to create her own life, as the <b>one</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> envisioned did not actually exist.|$|E
500|$|In {{the parking}} lot, Andy has not shown {{up for the}} duel, instead leaving a {{deliberately}} verbose note hanging in the bushes saying he has given up. As Dwight reads it, Andy sneaks up behind him in his Toyota Prius, a hybrid car that remains completely silent when driven below five miles per hour due to the electric motor. Impressed by Andy's deviousness, {{the rest of the}} office does not warn Dwight, saying that Andy [...] "deserves the win". Andy pins Dwight between the car and the large bushes in the parking lot. Jim races out to check that Andy and Dwight are not seriously injured, but they snap at him to go away. The two bicker back and forth about Angela. However, the fight goes out of Dwight when he learns Andy has had sex with Angela, because she told him that he was the only <b>one</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> had sex with. Crestfallen, Dwight and Andy both admit defeat and return to the office, where Andy calls to cancel his wedding cake, and Dwight throws away a bobblehead doll Angela previously bought him as a gift. A saddened Angela realizes she has lost both men.|$|E

500|$|In Miami, Florida, Furtado {{collaborated with}} Pharrell (who {{introduced}} her to reggaeton and who gave her a [...] "shout-out" [...] in his 2005 single [...] "Can I Have It Like That") and Scott Storch (with whom she recorded a [...] "straight-up rap song") before entering the studio with Timbaland. He and his protégé at the time, Danja, co-produced eight of the tracks, with another produced solely by Danja. For some of the beats on the songs, Timbaland finished work on ones already present in the studio that were half-developed or just [...] "nucleuses"; the rest were completely reworked. Furtado recorded around forty tracks for Loose, deciding which she would include based on the s of the album—she called Timbaland [...] "a sonic extraterrestrial" [...] {{who came up with}} a sequence of songs that flowed, and said that the <b>one</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> devised was supposedly unsatisfactory. She recorded an unreleased collaboration with Justin Timberlake, [...] "Crowd Control", which she described as [...] "kind of sexy" [...] and [...] "a cute, clubby, upbeat, fun track". Other songs considered for inclusion on the album include [...] "Chill Boy", [...] "Friend of Mine", [...] "Go", [...] "Hands in the Air", [...] "Pretty Boy", [...] "Vice" [...] and [...] "Weak".|$|E

Although Atkins had no experience in artist management or music, Vaughan wished to have a mixed professional and personal relationship like the <b>one</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> with Treadwell. She made Atkins her personal manager, although she was still feeling the sting of the problems she had with Treadwell and initially kept a slightly closer eye on Atkins.

2500|$|In 1963, Deutsch {{retired as}} a {{training}} analyst {{in part due to}} her husband, Felix’s, declining health and memory loss. In 1963, Felix Deutsch died. Following his death, Helene Deutsch began to reminisce about her life with Felix and all that he had given her. Her relationship with Felix, up to that point, had always been a little bit strained. Through numerous affairs, like the <b>one</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> with Sándor Rado, Deutsch had always felt that Felix was more of the mother figure than she.
