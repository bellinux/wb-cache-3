Many different <b>objective</b> <b>rates</b> can be developed. <b>Objective</b> stress <b>rates</b> are of particular interest in continuum mechanics because they are required for constitutive models, expressed in terms of time derivatives of stress and strain, to be frame-indifferent.|$|R

50|$|Job {{performance}} {{is measured by}} <b>objective</b> <b>rating</b> performance and subjective ratings. Although the former is better than subjective ratings, most of studies in job performance and GCA {{have been based on}} supervisor performance ratings. This rating criteria is considered problematic and unreliable, mainly because of its difficulty to define what is a good and bad performance. Rating of supervisors tends to be subjective and inconsistent among employees. Additionally, supervisor rating of job {{performance is}} influenced by different factors, such as halo effect, facial attractiveness, racial or ethnic bias, and height of employees. However, Vinchur, Schippmann, Switzer and Roth (1998) found in their study with sales employees that objective sales performance had a correlation of 0.04 with GCA, while supervisor performance rating got a correlation of 0.40. These findings were surprising, considering that the main criteria for assessing these employees would be the objective sales.|$|E

40|$|Background: Studies {{have not}} {{adequately}} compared subjective/objective ratings of female dermatology patients including patients presenting for cosmetic procedures. Objective: To examine objective versus subjective facial attractiveness ratings, demographic variables, and how men versus women judge female facial attractiveness. Methods: Sixty-five women (mean 42 years) presenting to a dermatology office. Subjects filled out a demographic and attractiveness questionnaire and were photographed. Four judges (2 male and 2 female) rated the photographs on a predefined 1 to 7 scale. Results: Mean subjective rating (subjects rating themselves) was 4. 85 versus 3. 61 for <b>objective</b> <b>rating</b> (judges rating subjects) (p< 0. 001). The {{mean age of}} subjects self-rating (subjective rating) who rated themselves in the 5 to 7 range was 39 years; {{the mean age of}} subjects self-rating (subjective rating) who rated themselves in the 3 to 4 range was 45 years (p= 0. 053). The mean age of subjects objectively rated by judges in the 5 to 7 range was 33 years; the mean age of subjects objectively rated by judges in the 3 to 4 range was 43 years (p< 0. 001); and the mean age of subjects objectively rated by judges in the 1 to 2 range was 50 years (p< 0. 001). The mean subjective rating (subjects rating themselves) for married women was 4. 55 versus 5. 27 for unmarried women (p= 0. 007); the mean <b>objective</b> <b>rating</b> (judges rating subjects) was 3. 22 versus 4. 15 (p< 0. 001). The mean <b>objective</b> <b>rating</b> by male judges was 3. 09 versus 4. 12 for female judges (p< 0. 001) Conclusion: Female patients presenting to a dermatology office rated themselves more attractive than did judges who viewed photographs of the subjects. Age and marital status were significant factors, and male judges rated attractiveness lower than female judges.

40|$|Three {{different}} {{evaluations of}} the energy dependence of the transmission-detection function of a two-stage cylindrical electron analyzer have been obtained by resorting to three established procedures. Their relative merits have been tested as follows. First they {{have been used to}} correct raw XPS spectra of clean Cu, Ag and Au surfaces. Next, the secondary electron background has been subtracted using Tougaard's method. Finally, the primary electron spectra so obtained have been reanalyzed by peak area measurement in the frame of the modern formalism for quantitative XPS analysis. Ideally a constant residual value should thus be obtained. The variability of these residuals with peak energy allows an <b>objective</b> <b>rating</b> of the initial transmission-detection functions. Comment: 29 page...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{formulations}} of elastoplasticity {{in the presence}} of finite strain and large rotation are Eulerian type and widely used; they are based upon, among other things, the additive decomposition of the stretching or the Eulerian strain-rate into elastic and plastic parts. In such formulations, yield functions and <b>objective</b> <b>rate</b> constitutive equations are expressed in terms of objective Eulerian tensor quantities, including the stretching, the Kirchhoff stress, internal state variables, etc. Each of these quantities transforms in a corotational manner under a change of the observing frame. According to the principle of material frame-indifference or objectivity, each constitutive function should be invariant, whenever the observing frame is changed to another one by any given time-dependent rotation. In this work the general form of constitutive equations is discussed. Several frequently used <b>objective</b> <b>rates</b> are analyzed with respect to their serviceability to develop a self-consistent formulation, i. e. to be integrable to deliver an elastic in particular hyperelastic relation for vanishing plastic deformation. This would be of great importance, e. g., for so-called spring back calculations in metal forming...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. So far rather weak tendencies {{towards an}} {{infrastructure}} for external ratings by indepen-dent {{agencies have been}} observed in Europe in recent decades. Especially for {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs), thus far there has been no possibility of obtaining an <b>objective</b> <b>rating.</b> The reason is that information is very asymmetric between investors and capital demands on small and medium-sized companies. But due to the new capital accord by the Basel Committee on Bank-ing Supervision the situation will change. Our paper shows that having Basel II in mind there is need for rating also medium-sized companies. We will also give an overview of characteristics that have to be incorporated in such ratings and further describe models, products and companies in this sector. Especially so-called soft computing methods like Fuzzy Logic or Neural Networks are very promising approaches in the field of rating SMEs...|$|E

40|$|A {{neural network}} based model is {{developed}} to quantify speech intelligibility by blind-estimating speech transmission index, an <b>objective</b> <b>rating</b> index for speech intelligibility of transmission channels, from transmitted speech signals without resort to knowledge of original speech signals. It {{consists of a}} Hilbert transform processor for speech envelope detection, a Welch average periodogram algorithm for envelope spectrum estimation, a principal components analysis (PCA) network for speech feature extraction and a multi-layer back-propagation network for non-linear mapping and case generalisation. The developed model circumvents the use of artificial test signals by exploiting naturally occurring speech signals as probe stimuli, reduces measurement channels from two to one and hence facilitates in situ assessment of speech intelligibility. From a cognitive science viewpoint, the proposed method might {{be viewed as a}} successful paradigm of mimicking human perception of speech intelligibility using a hybrid model built around artificial neural networks...|$|E
