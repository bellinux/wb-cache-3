50|$|The spotted skink (Niveoscincus ocellatus), {{sometimes}} called the ocellated cool-skink or <b>ocellated</b> <b>skink,</b> is a skink endemic to Tasmania, Australia. It is a ground-dwelling, viviparous species, usually found in rocky habitats, and widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the state, {{as well as in}} the eastern Bass Strait islands. The N. ocellatus is often found at Arthurs Lake in the Central Highlands of Tasmania.|$|E
50|$|Bedriaga's skink {{resembles a}} {{scaled-down}} {{version of the}} <b>ocellated</b> <b>skink</b> (Chalcides ocellatus). It has a small head, an elongated cylindrical body and short limbs with five digits on each foot. It measures up to 17 cm in length, {{at least half of}} which may be the fairly broad tail. Females are usually larger than males and in both sexes the tail may sometimes be broken off or in the process of regeneration. There are 24 to 28 scales around the mid-body. The colour is pale brown, yellowish-brown or grey with numerous small black-edged eyespots and usually a paler lateral line running along either side. Juveniles are a darker colour.|$|E

The <b>ocellated</b> <b>skink</b> (Niveoscincus ocellatus), Tasmanian tree skink (Niveoscincus pretiosus) and she-oak skink (Cyclodomorphus casuarinae) are all endemic to Tasmania and found in the park. Other species found include the blotched blue-tongued lizard (Tiliqua nigrolutea), mountain dragon (Rankinia diemensis) and lowland copperhead snake (Austrelaps superbus). The Tasmanian froglet (Ranidella tasmaniensis) is also endemic to Tasmania and {{can be seen in}} several creeks in Freycinet, along with the frequently spotted common eastern froglet (Crinia signifera) found in low-lying water bodies such as swamps. Other amphibians found include the southern toadlet (Pseudophryne semimarmorata), spotted grass frog (Limnodynastes tasmaniensis), southern brown tree frog (Litoria ewingii) and growling grass frog (Litoria raniformis).|$|E

40|$|A {{diversity}} of animals {{move on and}} bury within dry and wet granular media, such as dry desert sand or rainforest soils. Little {{is known about the}} biomechanics and neural control strategies used to move within these complex terrains. Burial and subsurface locomotion provides a particularly interesting behavior in which to study principles of interaction because the entire body becomes surrounded by the granular environment. In this dissertation, we used three model organisms to elucidate control principles of movement within granular substrates: the sand-specialist sandfish lizard which dives into dry sand using limb-ground interactions, and swims subsurface using body undulations; the long-slender shovel-nosed snake which undulates subsurface in dry sand with low slip; and the <b>ocellated</b> <b>skink,</b> a desert generalist which buries into both wet and dry substrates. Using muscle activation measurements we discovered that the sandfish targeted optimal kinematics which maximized forward speed and minimized the mechanical cost of transport. The simplicity of the sandfish body and kinematics coupled with a fluid-like model of the granular media revealed the fundamental mechanism responsible for neuromechanical phase lags, a general timing phenomenon between muscle activation and curvature along the body that has been observed in all undulatory animals that move in a variety of environments. Kinematic experiments revealed that the snake moved subsurface using a similar locomotion strategy as the sandfish, but its long body and low skin friction enabled higher performance (lower slip). The <b>ocellated</b> <b>skink</b> used a different locomotor pattern than observed in the sandfish and snake but that was sufficient for burial into both wet and dry media. Furthermore, the <b>ocellated</b> <b>skink</b> could only reach shallow burial depths in wet compared to dry granular media. We attribute this difference to the higher resistance forces in wet media and hypothesize that the burial efficacy is force-limited. These studies reveal basic locomotor principles of burial and subsurface movement in granular media and demonstrate the impact of environmental interaction in locomotor behavior. Ph. D...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{morphological}} {{and physiological}} changes involved in pregnancy in live-bearing reptiles are well studied, the genetic mechanisms that underlie {{these changes are}} not known. We used the viviparous African <b>Ocellated</b> <b>Skink,</b> Chalcides ocellatus, as a model to identify a near complete gene expression profile associated with pregnancy using RNA-Seq analyses of uterine transcriptomes. Pregnancy in C. ocellatus is associated with upregulation of uterine genes involved with metabolism, cell proliferation and death, and cellular transport. Moreover, there are clear parallels between the genetic processes associated with pregnancy in mammals and Chalcides in expression of genes related to tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, immune system regulation, and nutrient provisioning to the embryo. In particular, the pregnant uterine transcriptome is dominated by expression of proteolytic enzymes that we speculate are involved both with remodeling the chorioallantoic placenta and histotrophy in the omphaloplacenta. Elements of the maternal innate immune system are downregulated in the pregnant uterus, indicating a potential mechanism to avoid rejection of the embryo. We found a downregulation of major histocompatability complex loci and estrogen and progesterone receptors in the pregnant uterus. This pattern is similar to mammals but cannot {{be explained by the}} mammalian model. The latter finding provides evidence that pregnancy is controlled by different endocrinological mechanisms in mammals and reptiles. Finally, 88 % of the identified genes are expressed in both the pregnant and the nonpregnant uterus, and thus, morphological and physiologica...|$|E
