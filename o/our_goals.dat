As you may know, in today's world, people are increasingly mobile and their work takes them to a variety of locations.

A Place at the Table, the decade's most important book on the gay movement.” The book, claimed Carpenter, “articulated better than any book before or since gays' rightful place in our culture” and “fueled a self-conscious movement of gay moderates and conservatives that is still redirecting gay politics.” Largely {{as a result of}} Bawer's book, a “new generation” of gays entered politics and “insisted that gay organizations put issues like marriage {{at the top of the}} agenda.” To be sure, “A Place at the Table wasn't solely responsible for all of this...
