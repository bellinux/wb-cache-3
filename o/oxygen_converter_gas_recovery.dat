50|$|The big American {{steelmakers}} {{caught up}} late {{with the new}} technology; the first <b>oxygen</b> <b>converters</b> in the United States were launched {{at the end of}} 1954 by McLouth Steel in Trenton, Michigan, which accounted for less than 1 per cent of the national steel market. U.S. Steel and Bethlehem Steel introduced the oxygen process only in 1964. By 1970 half of the world's and 80% of Japan's steel output was produced in <b>oxygen</b> <b>converters.</b> In {{the last quarter of the}} 20th century use of basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>converters</b> for steel production was gradually partially replaced by the electric arc furnace using scrap steel/iron. In Japan the share of LD process decreased from 80% in 1970 to 70% in 2000; worldwide share of the basic oxygen process stabilized at 60%.|$|R

50|$|The {{converter}} {{was a top}} blow <b>oxygen</b> <b>converter,</b> {{similar to}} Linz-Donawitz type, using a cylindrical vessel; the vessel was tilted whilst conversion took place, with typical rotation speeds of around 30 revolutions per minute; the oxygen was injected via a lance, with slag forming materials added separately.|$|R
40|$|Understanding the <b>recovery</b> of <b>gas</b> from {{reservoirs}} featuring pervasive nanopores {{is essential}} for effective shale gas extraction. Classical theories cannot accurately predict such <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> and many experimental observations are not well understood. Here we report molecular simulations of the <b>recovery</b> of <b>gas</b> from single nanopores, explicitly taking into account molecular gas-wall interactions. We show that, in very narrow pores, the strong gas-wall interactions are essential in determining the <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> behavior both quantitatively and qualitatively. These interactions cause the total diffusion coefficients of the gas molecules in nanopores to be smaller than those predicted by kinetic theories, hence slowing down the rate of <b>gas</b> <b>recovery.</b> These interactions also lead to significant adsorption of gas molecules on the pore walls. Because of the desorption of these gas molecules during <b>gas</b> <b>recovery,</b> the <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> from the nanopore does not exhibit the usual diffusive scaling law (i. e., the accumulative recovery scales as R ∼ t^ 1 / 2 but follows a super-diffusive scaling law R ∼ t^n (n> 0. 5), {{which is similar to}} that observed in some field experiments. For the system studied here, the super-diffusive <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> scaling law can be captured well by continuum models in which the gas adsorption and desorption from pore walls are taken into account using the Langmuir model.

30|$|Substitute the {{calculated}} cumulative production at different production time in Eq. (33), {{and the relationship}} between <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> and well pattern density can be obtained, as shown in Fig.  6. Figure  6 shows that as the density of the well pattern decreases, the <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> rate increases. When the well pattern density is 45 – 60  km 2 /well, the increase rate of the <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> is not obvious. Because the controllable reserves of a single well are certain. When the well pattern density exceeds the technical limit well density of a single well, it is usually not used to reduce the well spacing to improve <b>gas</b> <b>recovery.</b> When it is compared with the Sherka’s empirical formula, the trend of this model in the paper is generally the same, except that the nodes and amplitudes of the curve rise are different.|$|R

40|$|Metallurgical wastes – <b>oxygen</b> <b>converter</b> sludge, {{dust from}} cast iron production, lead matte, and slag from {{recycling}} of used lead batteries – {{were treated with}} Acidithiobacillus bacteria. Bacterial activity and adaptability on waste and some waste mixtures were investigated. Acidithiobacillus bacteria may easily attack <b>oxygen</b> <b>converter</b> sludge, lead matte and slag and affect the mobility of metals. Cast iron dust is not a suitable substrate for applied bacteria due {{to the absence of}} reduced sulfur and reduced iron in its mineralogical composition. Nevertheless, the pure culture was able to adapt to the mixture of this waste with slag. Disposal of these metallurgical wastes deserves special attention due to potential attack by microorganisms and consequent pH changes. According to subsequent release of hazardous substances to the environment, this phenomenon can lead to evident environmental risks. Web of Science 30330129...|$|R

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1948 VÖEST, ÖAMG and Swiss Roll AG agreed to co-develop the basic oxygen {{steelmaking}} process proposed by Robert Durrer (itself a development of Henry Bessemer's 1858 patent). By June 1949 VÖEST developed an adaptation of Durrer's process, the LD (Linz-Donawitz) process, (German: LD Verfahren; U.S. names: <b>Oxygen</b> <b>Converter</b> Process, Basic <b>Oxygen</b> Furnace Process, BOP, OSM). In December 1949 the VÖEST and the ÖAMG committed to building their first 30-ton <b>oxygen</b> <b>converters.</b> They were put into operation in November 1952 and May 1953 and temporarily created a surge in steel-related research. 34 thousand businesspeople and engineers visited the VÖEST converter by 1963. The LD process reduced processing time and capital costs per ton of steel, contributing to the competitive advantage of Austrian steel. However, errors made by the VÖEST and the ÖAMG management in licensing their technology made control over its adoption elsewhere impossible {{and by the end}} of the 1950s the Austrians lost their competitive edge.|$|R

30|$|Some noncommercial gas {{reservoirs}} {{with low}} gas reserves are feasible sites for CO 2 geological sequestration. Many of them contain natural gas {{that can be}} potentially recovered. CO 2 sequestration in those natural gas reservoirs can be coupled with enhanced <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> by injecting CO 2. The added <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> {{can be used to}} offset the cost of CO 2 capture and storage (CCS). This idea was first planned for abandoned gas reservoirs and called carbon sequestration with enhanced <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> (CSEGR) (Oldenburg 2003). In reality, typical noncommercial gas reservoirs are similar. Although CSEGR has been discussed for more than 10  years (for example, Blok et al. 1997), the published field tests are only in Hungary (Kubus 2010), the Netherlands (Van der Meer et al. 2005) and the USA (Turta et al. 2008).|$|R
40|$|This article {{deals with}} the problem of the reduced {{efficiency}} of management in complex production - transport systems {{due to the lack of}} co-ordination in the operation of industrial enterprises and transport carrying out their maintenance. The existing transport service schedules for auxiliary departments do not take into account possible changes in operating conditions, the probability of malfunctions and the amount of reserves, which leads to an increase in general production costs. To solve this problem, we propose to use the interval regulation of production and transport processes in all departments of the complex production and transport systems. Also, such regulation involves the determination of traffic service priority. This will allow passing on from the regulated control of production and transport processes to the situational one, adapted to specific conditions, and reducing losses from untimely transport servicing, which will lead to a stores reduction and efficiency increase of the enterprise circulating facilities use. Testing the effectiveness of interval regulation was performed on the system and dynamics simulation model of liquid iron transportation in the <b>oxygen</b> <b>converter</b> shop of the metallurgical enterprise. It was established that the use of interval regulation processes in iron production and its transportation will allow decreasing non-productive downtime by 21 % and the amount of the liquid iron in anticipation of recasting in the <b>oxygen</b> <b>converter</b> shop – by 33 %. Economical effect of reducing the liquid iron downtime during transportation to the <b>oxygen</b> <b>converter</b> shop will be about 30 million rubles per year...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Part {{of the gas}} fields utilize {{eddy current}} {{instruments}} to drainage and <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> currently, while the mechanism of drainage and <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> is not clear. This article conducts drainage and <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> simulating caculation, analyses the impact of gas flow rate, the moisture content of bottomhole and eddy current tool structure of its drainage effect, basing on the theory of gas-liquid two-phase flow. The results show that: the gas flow rate, moisture content and the normal section shape of eddy current tool spiral piece are the main factors that affect the eddy current tools draining. As follows: the larger the gas flowing rate, the better the tool draining effect; when the bottomhole moisture content is less than 10 %, the draining effect is not obvious; but when the bottomhole moisture content is greater than 10 %, with higher the moisture content, the draining effect is more obvious; the normal section shape of spiral piece {{is better to be}} rectangular rather than trapezoidal; the direction of rotation of the spiral piece (left and right hand) has little effect on draining...|$|R

30|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} involved in stimulation of ultra-tight gas sandstones is fluid retention. Fluid retention/phase trapping is one {{of the major}} formation damage mechanisms that impedes the production of natural gas on flowback of a fractured well and overall <b>gas</b> <b>recovery.</b> Other damage mechanisms in low permeability reservoirs include gel residue, proppant crushing, and migration of fines. In this article, emphasis is placed on fluid retention since literature review has identified fluid retention as the most prevalent cause of reduced gas productivity from tight gas reservoirs. In some cases, phase trapping/fluid retention has accounted for a loss of about 20  % reduction of post-stimulation <b>gas</b> <b>recovery.</b>|$|R
