One was single wicket in which, {{as the name}} implies, {{there is only one}} batsman, {{although}} teams of threes or fives often took part. The converse is the [...] "double wicket" [...] form, with two batsmen, and this has long been associated with eleven-a-side teams playing two innings each and it is these games which, depending on the teams involved, have important match status. Although single wicket was in vogue through the period of this history, the earliest definite record of a single wicket match is in 1726, so it is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>scope</b> in this article.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} well {{received}} by film critics {{and even the}} passing mentions in The Moving Picture World remarked {{that it was a}} good offering with good photography. Jack Harvey's debut film as a director was well received by the public due to its [...] "universally appealing" [...] theme. Thanhouser writes that the [...] "loyal dog's attachment to his little girl playmate is treated with pictorial beauty and simple, honest sentiment", and notes that when it was released on October 4, 1914, reviewers praised the [...] "double-exposure passages for their dramatic effectiveness". Louis Reeves Harrison of The Moving Picture World review of the film stated, [...] "This play becomes one of delicate pathos toward the end through some remarkable feats of double exposure, and it is one of beauty throughout because of the acting of a four-year-old tot, Baby Helen, a veritable star in her class. Shep contributes with exceptional intelligence - he is not eternally looking at his master <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>scope</b> for a word of command. ... I do not know what director handled this subject, but I suggest he apply his thought visualizations to the human characters of future stories. It is the exhibition of what passes in the minds and hearts of characters that brings an audience into closer sympathy with them and makes tense interest possible when melodrama merely brings a laugh. The double exposures are timed with such skill in this instance that all concerned in their production deserve high praise. They give beauty and dignity to a very simple story." ...|$|E
