5|$|After an {{exhibition}} rout of US Armed Forces, the Lady Vols {{opened up the}} season unusually, with a conference game against Mississippi. Semeka Randall did not start the game. However, four minutes into the game, the Lady Vols were only up 4–2. At this point, Randall was put into the game, and Tennessee scored fifteen straight, on a run fueled by her. Randall scored 24, and star Chamique Holdsclaw added 23. This season opener has {{caused a lot of}} anticipation, as it was expected that this would be the game where all four of Tennessee's freshman played together. However, during a November practice, Clement had injured her foot, resulting in a stress fracture. After a discussion with the team doctor, Clement agreed to sit out the Mississippi game in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to play the next game, against Louisiana Tech.|$|E

Eventually, accommodation was provided there for 70,000 troops. As divisions returned from tours of duty in New Guinea in 1943 and 1944, they were sent to Atherton for anti-malaria treatment.

Since the species are listed as endangered, any remains of dead animals are confiscated {{by the federal government}} and transported to a central repository in Colorado; members of Native American Indian nations then have to apply individually to receive parts, such as feathers, in a lengthy process with wait-times that can exceed several years. Since a tribally operated eagle sanctuary constitutes an exception to the process, it would be instrumental in strengthening Navajo cultural sovereignty; currently, only the Iowa and Zuni nations operate eagle sanctuaries for this purpose.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} 18 N-3PBs {{were used}} to equip No. 330 (Norwegian) Squadron RAF in Reykjavík, Iceland. The N-3PBs sent to Iceland were all shipped across the Atlantic in crates on board the Norwegian steamer , the voyage from New York to Reykjavik taking 13 days to complete. Part {{of the reason for}} deploying the N-3PBs to Iceland were to avoid having the unusual aircraft operating over the United Kingdom, with the involved risk of friendly fire incidents.

Monro complained that the terms of capitulation had been violated, but his contingent was forced to surrender some of its baggage in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> even to begin the march. As they marched off, they were harassed by the swarming Indians, who snatched at them, grabbing for weapons and clothing, and pulling away with force those that resisted their actions, including many of the women, children, servants and slaves.

25|$|While the Australian Government was {{reassured}} by Britain's {{assessment of the}} situation, the Allied military units stationed in Western Australia made preparations to resist a possible Japanese attack.

It also stockpiled bombs at Cunderdin to the north-east of Perth for use by any heavy bombers sent as reinforcements. The readiness of the Army garrison units in the Fremantle-Perth area were also increased. The Fremantle Fortress command, which {{was responsible for the}} defence of the port against naval bombardment or air attack, was placed on alert and <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> station additional heavy anti-aircraft guns near the city's docks.

5|$|To gain further match experience, Messi joined Barcelona C in {{addition}} to the Juveniles A, playing his first game for the third team on 29 November. He helped save them from the relegation zone of the Tercera División, scoring five goals in ten games, including a hat-trick in eight minutes during a Copa del Rey match while man-marked by Sevilla's Sergio Ramos. His progress was reflected in his first professional contract, signed on 4 February 2004, which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial buyout clause of €30million. A month later, on 6 March, he made his debut for Barcelona B in the Segunda División B, and his buyout clause automatically increased to €80million. He played five games with the B team that season but did not score. Physically he was weaker than his opponents, who were often much older and taller, and in training he worked on increasing his muscle mass and overall strength in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to shake off defenders. Towards the end of the season, he returned to both youth teams, helping the Juveniles B win the league.
