25|$|The {{theory of}} false {{necessity}} attempts to understand humans and human history without making <b>ourselves</b> <b>the</b> object of a law-giving fate. It rejects {{the assumption that}} certain and necessary laws of organization and change govern the social, political, and economic institutions of human activity and thereby limit human freedom. It holds that the problem with traditional deep structure theory, such as Marxism, is that it couples the distinction of deep structure and routine practice with both indivisible types of social organization, and deep seated constraints and developmental laws. The theory rejects the constraints and focuses on how human behavior is shaped by the deep structures of these institutions, {{and how they can}} be remade at will, either in whole or in part. The aim is to rescue social theory and recreate the project of self-affirmation and society.|$|E

500|$|For that Stanley Cup win, {{each of the}} team's players {{was given}} a silver nugget by team {{executive}} Bob Shillington, an Ottawa druggist and mining investor.

In a 1957 interview, Harry Westwick recalled that at the presentation [...] "One of the players said 'We ought to call <b>ourselves</b> <b>the</b> Silver Seven.' and the name caught on right there." [...] (At the time, hockey teams iced seven men—a goaltender, three forwards, two defencemen and a rover).|$|E

500|$|With all his {{frequently}} noted {{attention to}} character and characters—Hazlitt's partly psychological approach to character necessarily referred to observed real-life behavior—he also frequently emphasises the art by which Shakespeare created dramatic [...] "character". Particularly in tragedy, a [...] "sense of power", he believed, {{is the essential}} medium by which a poet of genius operates {{on the minds of}} his audience. When the author instills in the reader or viewer's imagination the sense of power that he must have had in grasping and conveying intertwined passions, he makes us identify with a character such as Othello, and feel in <b>ourselves</b> <b>the</b> way Iago plays upon his mind so that, ironically, his weakness is made to undermine his strength.|$|E

500|$|James Cameron {{has said}} that he [...] "tried to make a film that would touch people's spirituality across the broad spectrum." [...] He also stated that one of the film's {{philosophical}} underpinnings is that [...] "the Na'vi represent that sort of aspirational part of ourselves that wants to be better, that wants to respect nature, while the humans in the film represent the more venal versions of <b>ourselves,</b> <b>the</b> banality of evil that comes with corporate decisions that are made out of remove of the consequences." [...] Film director John Boorman saw a similar dichotomy as a key factor contributing to its success: [...] "Perhaps the key is the marine in the wheelchair. [...] He is disabled, but Mr Cameron and technology can transport him into the body of a beautiful, athletic, sexual, being. [...] After all, we are all disabled in one way or another; inadequate, old, broken, earthbound. [...] Pandora is a kind of heaven where we can be resurrected and connected instead of disconnected and alone." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Brazil is, next to <b>ourselves,</b> <b>the</b> {{great power}} on the American continent", affirmed James Watson Webb, the U.S. {{minister}} to Brazil, in 1867. The Empire's rise was noticed as early as 1844 by John C. Calhoun, the U.S. Secretary of State: [...] "Next to the United States, Brazil is the most wealthy, the greatest and the most firmly established of all the American powers." [...] By the early 1870s, the international reputation of the Empire of Brazil had improved considerably, and it remained well-regarded internationally until its end in 1889. Christopher Columbus Andrews, an American diplomat in the Brazilian capital in the 1880s, later recalled Brazil as an [...] "important Empire" [...] in his memoirs. In 1871, Brazil was invited to arbitrate the dispute between the United States and Britain which {{became known as the}} Alabama Claims. In 1880, the Empire acted as arbiter between the United States and France over the damage caused to U.S. nationals during the French intervention in Mexico. In 1884, Brazil was called upon to arbitrate between Chile and several other nations (France, Italy, Britain, Germany, Belgium, Austria-Hungary and Switzerland) over damages arising from the War of the Pacific.|$|E
500|$|Loyalty to Loyaltys title {{comes from}} a paper {{of the same name}} by American philosopher Josiah Royce, in which he {{challenged}} Friedrich Nietzsche's ideas about [...] "will to power" [...] and the übermensch, [...] "saying that the ultimate pursuit of mankind should be to live in community and embrace each other, not to try to trample each other and rise to the top." [...] Maust said that he could relate to that phrase with the band saying that it's [...] "very similar to how [...] conduct <b>ourselves,</b> <b>the</b> way that [...] write songs and the way that [...] view each other in the band. No one person is writing for the other person, but we are loyal to each other. We're loyal to loyalty." [...] For the recording process, Maust explained that they took four months to experiment with deeper and grittier sounds they were comfortable with, compared to the first record that took eight days to create that carried [...] "a much more polished, for-radio sound." [...] He also commented that the overall dark tone throughout the album was the cause of constant touring across Europe, but said that it did more good than harm for the band because it led to them crafting songs that weren't written from the perspective of being on the road.|$|E

500|$|California is the band's first release through BMG Rights Management, {{and also}} among BMG's first {{releases}} through its distribution {{deal with the}} Alternative Distribution Alliance. The album was initially slated to be released independently, but they decided to work with BMG when that label acquired Vagrant Records. Vagrant had a promotional team that, according to Blink's manager Lawrence Varra, understood the culture surrounding the band and genre. The deal allowed the band and its management to be in near-complete control of the release and promotion of California. [...] "We didn't {{have to listen to}} a major label spend the money they wanted to spend, [...] we'd just spend it <b>ourselves</b> <b>the</b> way we wanted to," [...] said Varra. Rather than [...] "window" [...] the album — an industry term for its release being exclusively physical {{for a period of time}} — the team chose to release California as wide as possible. [...] "We wanted the music to be accessible to the younger kids who listen to it on YouTube and Spotify and different places," [...] he said. In addition, they employed ticketing tiers for the California Tour, making it possible for hardcore fans to obtain the best seats, but also allowing it to be affordable for more casual fans. However, a hit was not guaranteed: [...] "I was speculative leading up, and nervous. This record could have gone either way," [...] said Jon Cohen, EVP of recorded music for BMG.|$|E
500|$|The Ramones' {{debut album}} had an outsized effect {{relative}} to its modest sales. According to Generation X bassist Tony James, [...] "Everybody went up three gears {{the day they}} got that first Ramones album. Punk rock—that rama-lama super fast stuff—is totally down to the Ramones. Bands were just playing in an MC5 groove until then." [...] The Ramones' two July 1976 shows, like their debut album, are seen as having {{a significant impact on}} the style of many of the newly formed British punk acts—as one observer put it, [...] "instantly nearly every band speeded up". The Ramones' first British concert, at London's Roundhouse concert hall, was held on July 4, 1976, the United States Bicentennial. The Sex Pistols were playing in Sheffield that evening, supported by the Clash, making their public debut. The next night, members of both bands attended the Ramones' gig at the Dingwall's club. Ramones manager Danny Fields recalls a conversation between Johnny Ramone and Clash bassist Paul Simonon (which he mislocates at the Roundhouse): [...] "Johnny asked him, 'What do you do? Are you in a band?' Paul said, 'Well, we just rehearse. We call <b>ourselves</b> <b>the</b> Clash but we're not good enough.' Johnny said, 'Wait till you see us—we stink, we're lousy, we can't play. Just get out there and do it.'" [...] Another band whose members saw the Ramones perform, the Damned, played their first show two days later. The central fanzine of the early UK punk scene, Sniffin' Glue, was named after the song [...] "Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue", which appeared on the debut LP.|$|E
