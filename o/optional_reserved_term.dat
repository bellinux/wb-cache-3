This buffer effect is especially significant for Asian countries, and for countries exporting natural resources. Financial depth reduces the buffer role of IR in developing countries. Developing countries REER {{seem to be more}} sensitive to changes in reserve assets; whereas industrial countries display a significant relationship between hot money and REER. ...|$|R
