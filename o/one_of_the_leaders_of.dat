The council then declared his offices forfeit, and ordered the surrender of the castles in his custody. The main charge against Longchamp appears to have been his autocratic behaviour.|$|E

He requested Aqil's intercession with Kubrisi, which was unsuccessful. When Sheikh Yusef decided {{to take matters into}} his own hands by raising a group of armed partisans in Nazareth, the church was compelled to restore his employment.

Kubrisi recalled Aqil and his Hawwara irregulars to Acre, verbally lambasted them and dismissed them all from service. Aqil was deeply insulted by Kubrisi's words and actions, and subsequently left for Transjordan where he sought the protection of the Beni Sakhr tribe.|$|E

Following the reconquest of North Africa by the East Roman (Byzantine) Empire in the Vandalic War (533–534), several uprisings by the native Berber tribes occurred in the North African provinces. Cutzinas is mentioned by the eyewitness historian Procopius of Caesarea as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>of</b> the rebellion in the province of Byzacena, alongside Esdilasas, Medisinissas and Iourphouthes.

5|$|In November 1918, {{soldiers}} from Emir Faisal's army entered Antioch and were welcomed by the city's Arab inhabitants. In late November, French troops {{landed on the}} coast of the Gulf of Alexandretta and entered the city of Alexandretta, prompting anti-French uprisings in Antioch, al-Hamammat and Qirqkhan and the al-Amuq area. In December, French troops occupied Antioch and replaced the Arab flag on its governmental headquarters with the French flag. The revolts continued in the city's countryside, namely in the vicinity of Harbiya and al-Qusayr. The local uprisings spread from the Antioch region to Aleppo's countryside as far as the Euphrates. The rebels consisted of small, disorganized ′iṣābāt (bands) and launched guerrilla-style attacks against French targets, but they also engaged in banditry and highway robberies. An early attempt to coordinate the various rebel groups took place when <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>of</b> the Antiochian uprising and Alawite notable, Najib al-Arsuzi, developed contacts with rebel leaders from Jisr al-Shughur and other areas.|$|E
5|$|More than 30,000 workers {{walked off}} {{their jobs in}} May 1919 in {{what came to be}} known as the Winnipeg general strike. The strike was a product of postwar recession, labour conditions, the {{activity}} of union organizers and a large influx of returning World War I soldiers seeking work. After many arrests, deportations, and incidents of violence, the strike ended on 21 June 1919 when the Riot Act was read and a group of Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers charged a group of strikers. Two strikers were killed and at least thirty others were injured on the day that became known as Bloody Saturday; the event polarized the population. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>of</b> the strike, J. S. Woodsworth, went on to found Canada's first major socialist party, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, which later became the New Democratic Party.|$|E
5|$|The Polish army {{commenced}} a {{siege of}} Smolensk and the Russo-Swedish relief expedition {{was defeated in}} 1610 by Hetman Żółkiewski at the Battle of Klushino. The victory strengthened {{the position of the}} compromise-oriented faction of Russian boyars, which had already been interested in offering the Moscow throne to Władysław Vasa, son of Sigismund III. Fyodor Nikitich Romanov, the Patriarch of Moscow, was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>of</b> the boyars. Under arrangements negotiated by Żółkiewski, the boyars deposed Tsar Vasili and accepted Władysław in return for peace, no annexation of Russia into the Commonwealth, the Prince's conversion to the Orthodox religion, and privileges, including exclusive rights to high offices in the Tsardom granted to the Russian nobility.
