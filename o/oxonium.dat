5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are often}} {{designed}} {{to mimic the}} transition state or intermediate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. This ensures that the inhibitor exploits the transition state stabilising effect of the enzyme, resulting in a better binding affinity (lower Ki) than substrate-based designs. An {{example of such a}} transition state inhibitor is the antiviral drug oseltamivir; this drug mimics the planar nature of the ring <b>oxonium</b> ion in the reaction of the viral enzyme neuraminidase.|$|E

25|$|Nucleophilic attack: the carbocation {{reacts with}} the {{nucleophile}}. If the nucleophile is a neutral molecule (i.e. a solvent) a third step {{is required to}} complete the reaction. When the solvent is water, the intermediate is an <b>oxonium</b> ion. This reaction step is fast.|$|E
25|$|In one study, the {{mechanism}} is established in silico {{taking into account}} the presence of solvent molecules and substituents. The rearrangement of acetone oxime in the Beckmann solution involves three acetic acid molecules and one proton (present as an <b>oxonium</b> ion). In the transition state leading to the iminium ion (σ-complex), the methyl group migrates to the nitrogen atom in a concerted reaction and the hydroxyl group is expulsed. The oxygen atom in the hydroxyl group is stabilized by the three acetic acid molecules. In the next step the electrophilic carbon atom in the nitrilium ion is attacked by water and the proton is donated back to acetic acid. In the transition state leading to the N-methyl acetimidic acid, the water oxygen atom is coordinated to 4 other atoms. In the third step, an isomerization step protonates the nitrogen atom leading to the amide.|$|E

2500|$|In chemistry, {{hydronium}} is {{the common}} name for the aqueous cation , the type of <b>oxonium</b> ion produced by protonation of water. [...] It is the positive ion present when an Arrhenius acid is dissolved in water, as Arrhenius acid molecules in solution give up a proton (a positive hydrogen ion, H+) to the surrounding water molecules (H2O).|$|E
2500|$|There are {{customary}} {{abbreviations for}} many of the counties. In most cases these consist of simple truncation, usually with an [...] "s" [...] at the end signifying [...] "shire", such as [...] "Berks" [...] for Berkshire or [...] "Bucks" [...] for Buckinghamshire. Some abbreviations are not obvious, such as [...] "Salop" [...] for Shropshire, from the Norman-derived word for its county town Shrewsbury; [...] "Oxon" [...] for Oxfordshire, from Latin <b>Oxonium</b> (referring to both the county and the city of Oxford); [...] "Hants" [...] for Hampshire; and [...] "Northants" [...] for Northamptonshire. Counties were often prefixed with [...] "County of" [...] in official contexts, such as [...] "County of Kent". Those counties named after central towns lost the -"shire" [...] suffix, for example Yorkshire would be known as [...] "County of York". This usage was sometimes followed even where there was no town by that name, such as the [...] "County of Berks". The [...] "-shire" [...] suffix was also appended for some counties, such as [...] "Devonshire", [...] "Dorsetshire" [...] and [...] "Somersetshire", despite their origin. There is still a Duke of Devonshire.|$|E

50|$|Like other <b>oxonium</b> ions, pyrylium is {{unstable}} {{in neutral}} water. However, pyrylium {{is much less}} reactive than ordinary <b>oxonium</b> ions because of aromatic stabilization. Pyrylium cations react with nucleophiles in the 2, 4, and 6 positions, which can induce ring-opening reactions. The high electronegativity of the oxygen results in the strongest single perturbation by one heteroatom in a six-membered ring.|$|E

50|$|Obtaining high {{selectivity}} for the desired product was possible, however, due {{to differences in}} the activation barriers for the step following ylide formation. If the ortho-methoxy group undergoes <b>oxonium</b> ylide formation, a 1,4-methyl shift can then generate an undesired product. The <b>oxonium</b> ylide formed from the other ortho-alkoxy group is primed to undergo a 2,3 sigmatropic rearrangement to yield the desired compound. Pirrung and coworkers reported complete selectivity for the desired product over the product resulting from a 1,4-methyl shift. This result suggests that <b>oxonium</b> ylide formation is reversible, but that the subsequent step is irreversible. The symmetry-allowed 2,3 sigmatropic rearrangement must follow a pathway that is lower in activation energy than the 1,4-methyl shift, explaining the exclusive formation of the desired product.|$|E
