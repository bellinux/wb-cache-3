500|$|Pavement had {{attained}} {{a degree of}} success within the underground music scene with its 1989 debut EP Slay Tracks (1933-1969). While Malkmus was traveling to parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, Kannberg managed Slay Tracks release on the band's self-owned label, Treble Kicker. Slay Tracks {{caught the attention of}} Dan Koretzky, an avid record collector working at Reckless Records in Chicago. Koretzky ordered 200 copies of the EP for the record store, and asked Kannberg to sign to his newly started independent label, Drag City. At the time the members of Pavement anticipated no further releases beyond Slay Tracks, and Kannberg initially expressed reluctance to sign to any label. Kannberg later said [...] "I started talking to [...] and in <b>our</b> <b>conversations</b> he said 'I'm starting this label. Do {{you want to do something}} for us?' I said, 'Well I don't know if we're even a band. Steve is off in Europe.' He said, [...] "Well if you want to I'm up for it.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{has said}} that artists who have {{influenced}} her musical style include Lisa [...] "Left Eye" [...] Lopes, Lil Wayne, Smokey Robinson, Lauryn Hill, Jadakiss, Natasha Bedingfield, Remy Ma, Lil' Kim, Missy Elliott, Janet Jackson, Madonna, Beyoncé, Britney Spears, Marilyn Monroe, Grace Jones, M.I.A., Cyndi Lauper and TLC. She cites Foxy Brown and Jay-Z as major influences: [...] "I really loved [...] as a female rapper. I was really interested in her mind and her aura [...] I was really, really into Jay-Z. Me and my friends in high school, we were reciting all of the Jay lyrics. His words were our words in <b>our</b> <b>conversations</b> all the time." [...] She said: [...] "I never really told Foxy how much she has influenced me and how much she changed my life, and you've gotta tell people that when they're alive to {{even be able to}} take the compliment, instead of paying tribute to them when they're no longer here", adding that Foxy Brown was [...] "the most influential female rapper" [...] for her, though she initially was compared to Lil Kim when she first debuted. Nicki and Lil Kim, often cited as Foxy's main rap rival, have reportedly exchanged words with each other, on social media and in their music.|$|E
2500|$|In the Plame affair, Scooter Libby, convicted {{chief of}} staff for Vice President Dick Cheney, told special {{prosecutor}} Patrick Fitzgerald that Russert told him of the identity of Central Intelligence Agency officer Valerie Plame (who is married to former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson). Russert testified previously, and again in United States v. I. Lewis Libby, that he would neither testify whether he spoke with Libby nor would he describe the conversation. Russert did say, however, that Plame's identity as a CIA operative was not leaked to him. Russert testified again in the trial on February 7, 2007. According to the Washington Post, Russert testified that [...] "when any senior government official calls him, they are presumptively off the record," [...] saying: [...] "when I talk to senior government officials on the phone, it's my own policy <b>our</b> <b>conversations</b> are confidential. If I want to use anything from that conversation, then I will ask permission." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to {{journalist}} Alan Nairn, Blair disobeyed {{orders from}} {{civilians in the}} Clinton administration during the 1999 East Timorese crisis during his tenure as commander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Command. Amid growing international concern over violence against the independence movement in Indonesian-occupied East Timor, Blair was ordered to meet with General Wiranto, {{the commander of the}} Indonesian military, and to tell him to shut down the pro-Indonesia militia. According to Nairn, two days after the Liquiçá Church Massacre, Blair failed to deliver this message; instead he presented Wiranto with an offer of military assistance and a personal invitation to be Blair's guest in Hawaii. Consequently, Wiranto’s [...] "forces increased the Timor killings". During his confirmation hearing as Director of National Intelligence, Blair responded to the accusations: [...] "In <b>our</b> <b>conversations</b> with leaders of Indonesia, both military and civilian, we decried and said that the torture and killing that was being conducted by paramilitary groups and some military groups in East Timor had to stop"; [...] "those who say that I was somehow carrying out my own policy or saying things that were not in accordance with American policy are just flat wrong".|$|E
6000|$|... 'You poor-spirited girl,' {{returned}} Miss Wade with infinite contempt; 'does all our companionship, do all <b>our</b> <b>conversations,</b> do {{all your}} old complainings, tell for so little as that?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps, Madam, you {{may have}} conceived, from <b>our</b> <b>conversations,</b> an {{unfavourable}} opinion of my professional skill. But I hope that on this head you will place your mind at ease; for"---- ...|$|E
60|$|At {{that moment}} Nicholas entered the room, heartily saluted my mother, and cut short <b>our</b> <b>conversation.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>Our</b> <b>conversation</b> {{during the}} drive was {{naturally}} {{occupied by the}} one absorbing subject of local interest.|$|R
60|$|Corny soon {{returned}} with a pleasant-faced woman, who undertook to superintend <b>our</b> <b>conversation</b> with the queen.|$|R
60|$|Within an {{hour after}} I had left him, Waster Lunny walked into the school-house and handed me his snuff-mull, which I {{declined}} politely. It was with this ceremony that we usually opened <b>our</b> <b>conversations.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It's you, Natalia Victorovna.... Perhaps you are surprised...at {{this late}} hour. But, you see, I remembered <b>our</b> <b>conversations</b> in that garden. I thought really {{it was your}} wish that I should--without loss of time...so I came. No other reason. Simply to tell..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then tell me {{all about}} yourself," [...] she suggested. [...] "Really, when I come to think of it, {{considering}} the length of <b>our</b> <b>conversations,</b> you have been remarkably reticent. You are the youngest of the family, are you not? How many brothers are there?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Long {{before we}} met him, one man {{dominated}} much of <b>our</b> <b>conversation</b> {{in the early}} days of our training; ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked across}} at the {{sleeping}} man. He was breathing heavily, and was evidently quite unconscious of <b>our</b> <b>conversation.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Simon Kenton {{must have}} been {{listening}} to <b>our</b> <b>conversation,</b> for he called sharply, when Paul was almost overcome with grief: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} as much during <b>our</b> <b>conversations</b> in Bachelors' Hall, but-- Stop a bit, Harry; these snow-shoe lines of mine have got {{loosened}} with tearing through this deep snow and these shockingly thick bushes. There--they are right now; go on. I {{was going to}} say that I don't--oh!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Apparently," [...] Hamel {{observed}} drily. [...] "And yet {{you must}} remember that you, too, are afraid of him. I need not remind you of <b>our</b> <b>conversations,</b> but there the truth is. You praise his virtues and his charities, you pity him, and yet you go about with a load of fear, and--forgive me--of secret terror in your heart, you and Gerald, too. As for your mother--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really," [...] he replied, [...] "there is not {{anything}} so very extraordinary about it, is there? Mr. Seaman, my partner {{in one or}} two mining enterprises, took me to call upon him. He is very interested in East Africa, politically and as a sportsman. <b>Our</b> <b>conversations</b> seemed to interest him and led to a certain intimacy--of which I may say that I am proud. I have the greatest respect and liking for the Prince." ...|$|E

60|$|Then <b>our</b> <b>conversation</b> {{turned to}} {{the matter of the}} {{resignation}} of certain Officers of the Army which had caused some passing public remark.|$|R
60|$|As <b>our</b> <b>conversation</b> had {{naturally}} turned {{upon the}} vacant seat, we lent a willing ear to this remark, {{and looked at}} our friend inquiringly.|$|R
60|$|No doubt, Sir, {{that you}} have noticed {{during the course of}} <b>our</b> <b>conversations</b> that Nature has endowed me with an over-sensitive heart. I feel keenly, Sir, very keenly. Blows dealt me by Fate, or, as has been more often the case, by the cruel and treacherous hand of man, touch me on the raw. I suffer acutely. I am highly strung. I am one of those rare beings whom Nature pre-ordained for love and for happiness. I am an ideal family man.|$|E
60|$|<b>Our</b> <b>conversations</b> are {{not always}} {{confined}} to his own history and misfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. His eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love, without tears. What a glorious creature must he {{have been in the}} days of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! He seems to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.|$|E
60|$|Although, therefore, {{we could}} now manage our sails easily, we {{nevertheless}} found that my pulleys were of much service {{to us in}} some things, though Jack did laugh heartily at the uncouth arrangement of ropes and blocks, which had, to a sailor's eye, a very lumbering and clumsy appearance. But I will not drag my reader through {{the details of this}} voyage. Suffice it to say that, after an agreeable sail of about three weeks, we arrived off the island of Mango, which I recognised at once from the description that the pirate Bill had given me of it during one of <b>our</b> <b>conversations.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think the}} subject of <b>our</b> <b>conversation</b> is very ill-chosen," [...] said Sir James, {{with a look of}} disgust. [...] "Suppose we change it." ...|$|R
6000|$|MITCHENER. Thank heaven shes gone. And now, my dear lady, is it {{necessary}} to keep that loaded pistol to my nose all through <b>our</b> <b>conversation?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see," [...] he murmured. [...] "And now, having reached {{just this}} stage in <b>our</b> <b>conversation,</b> {{let me ask you}} this. You read the newspapers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear boy, I do {{not blame}} you. It {{was the most}} natural thing in the world. I should have looked upon anyone as a madman who had talked to me as I have talked to you. But for all that, Robert, you were wrong, and I have never yet in <b>our</b> <b>conversations</b> {{proposed}} any scheme which it was not well within my power to carry out. I tell you in all sober earnest that the amount of my income is limited only by my desire, and that all the bankers and financiers combined could not furnish the sums which I can put forward without an effort." ...|$|E
60|$|However {{this may}} be, during the few days that we {{remained}} together Ayesha never {{so much as}} spoke of it again. It seemed to have served her purpose for the while, or in the press of other and more urgent matters to have been forgotten or thrust from her mind. Still, amongst others, of which I have said nothing, since {{it is necessary to}} select, I record this strange incident, and <b>our</b> <b>conversations</b> concerning it at length, for the reason that it made a great impression upon me and furnishes a striking example of Ayesha's dominion over the hidden forces of Nature whereof we were soon to experience a more fearful instance.|$|E
60|$|And now I {{began to}} live. All around me was {{changed from a}} dull {{uniformity}} to the brightest scene of joy and delight. The happiness I enjoyed {{in the company of}} my father far exceeded my sanguine expectations. We were for ever together; and the subjects of <b>our</b> <b>conversations</b> were inexhaustible. He had passed the sixteen years of absence among nations nearly unknown to Europe; he had wandered through Persia, Arabia and the north of India and had penetrated among the habitations of the natives with a freedom permitted to few Europeans. His relations of their manners, his anecdotes and descriptions of scenery whiled away delicious hours, when we were tired of talking of our own plans of future life.|$|E
60|$|I {{paid for}} my conveyance, and we strolled along the broad sidewalk. Lady Delahaye seemed {{inclined}} to thrust the onus of commencing <b>our</b> <b>conversation</b> upon me.|$|R
6000|$|... "This," [...] {{observed}} Dominey, [...] "is history, dished up in {{a somewhat}} partial fashion. I repeat my suggestion that we confine <b>our</b> <b>conversation</b> to the professional." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "what of him? You {{have not}} been seeking to settle {{accounts}} with him, I trust, after <b>our</b> <b>conversation,</b> and your promise?" ...|$|R
