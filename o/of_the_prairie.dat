The party leader left Ottawa for his riding, Rosetown—Biggar in Saskatchewan, on April 26, and remained there until May 10. He spent three days campaigning in Ontario, then moved west to the major cities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prairie</b> provinces and British Columbia, before returning to his riding for the final days before the June 10 election. Other CCF leaders took charge of campaigning in Quebec and the Maritimes.|$|E
5|$|Hays {{made the}} {{construction}} of the mainline his priority, failing to develop feeder lines. CNoR and CPR joined forces to gain control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prairie</b> traffic. The competition among the three railroads led to Canada's ending up with three transcontinental railways instead of one. This was to result in the GTP's being starved of traffic; even though it was arguably the best of the three, it ultimately failed to attract enough freight to make it profitable.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Prairie Village home {{purchase}} fell through, however, the couple's Missouri home caught fire while {{the family was}} out. Insurance investigators later determined that the fire was caused by an electrical short in a power cord. Though the house was reparable and the couple's home insurance paid out on the damage and lost property, the couple decided to move on, and Green and the children moved into the apartment in which Farrar had been living during the separation while the purchase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prairie</b> Village home was re-negotiated.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} tornado, later named the Lone Grove Tornado, first touched down in southeast Jefferson County, Oklahoma at 6:48pm CST (00:48UTC) near the Red River. The tornado crossed through {{rural areas as}} it moved to the northeast into Love County, before going into Carter County at 7:10pm CST (01:10UTC). The tornado continued moving to the northeast for the next 15 minutes before striking Lone Grove, Oklahoma.

5|$|Wright {{designed}} the Taliesin structure {{two years after}} leaving his first wife and home in Oak Park, Illinois with a mistress, Mamah Borthwick. The design of the original building {{was consistent with the}} design principles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prairie</b> School, emulating the flatness of the plains and the natural limestone outcroppings of Wisconsin's Driftless Area. The structure (which included an agricultural and studio wing) was completed in 1911.|$|E
5|$|On October 23, 1928, RCA {{announced}} it was merging Film Booking Offices and Keith-Albee-Orpheum to form the new motion picture business Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO), with Sarnoff as chairman. Kennedy, who retained Pathé, was paid $150,000 for arranging the merger {{on top of the}} millions of dollars in profit he made from selling off his stock. Joseph I. Schnitzer, ranking FBO vice-president, was elevated to president of the new company's production arm, replacing Kennedy. William LeBaron, the last FBO production chief, retained his position after the merger, but the new studio, dedicated to full sound production, cut ties with most of FBO's roster of silent-screen performers. Movies that Film Booking Offices had either produced or arranged to distribute were released under the FBO banner through the end of 1929. The last official FBO production to reach American theaters was Pals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prairie,</b> directed by Louis King and starring Buzz Barton and Frank Rice, released July 1, 1929.|$|E

5|$|Southern Manitoba (including {{the city}} of Winnipeg), falls into the humid {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen Dfb). This area is cold and windy {{in the winter and}} has frequent blizzards because of the open landscape. Summers are warm with a moderate length. This region is the most humid area in the prairie provinces, with moderate precipitation. Southwestern Manitoba, though under the same climate classification as the rest of Southern Manitoba, is closer to the semi-arid interior of Palliser's Triangle. The area is drier and more prone to droughts than other parts of southern Manitoba. This area is cold and windy in the winter and has frequent blizzards due to the openness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prairie</b> landscape. Summers are generally warm to hot, with low to moderate humidity.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} Coonley's son-in-law Waldron Faulkner, who, with his son (also an architect) Avery Coonley Faulkner, later became significant contributors {{to the design of}} George Washington University and American University in Washington, D.C. The design ties the building to the land in the style <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prairie</b> School, at the same time employing the handcrafted features and human scale typical of the American Arts and Crafts (or American Craftsman) style. The easy access to the outdoors, ground floor classrooms, separate science laboratories, and planned outdoor play area are among the features of the design that would later be adopted by schools throughout the US after World War II.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, the West Park Commission was riddled with {{political}} graft, and the three parks became dilapidated. As part of a reform effort in 1905, Jens Jensen was appointed as General Superintendent and Chief Landscape Architect for the entire West Park System. Jensen, now recognized as dean <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prairie</b> style of landscape architecture, improved deteriorating sections of the parks and added new features. Among Jensen's improvements were a semi-circular entryway at Marshall Boulevard, and a formal garden at the corner of Ogden Avenue and Sacramento Drive. By the time Jensen designed the garden, Ogden Avenue, a diagonal roadway with a major streetcar thoroughfare that would later become part of Route 66, had already been constructed. The road divided the park into two separate landscapes, creating a busy intersection at the junction of Ogden and Sacramento Avenues. Jensen's solution was a long axial garden on the southeast side of the intersection, providing a buffer between Ogden Avenue and playing fields to the south. Jensen demolished the conservatories in each of the West Park System parks in favor of one grand conservatory at Garfield Park.|$|E
