5|$|More {{than three}} years after its digital launch, Fez {{received}} a physical release designed by Fish and limited to a signed edition of 500 in December 2015. The deluxe package included the soundtrack and a stylized red notebook with gold foil inlay. Though Bédard had moved <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> company, he continued {{to work on the}} game in secret. In August 2016, he released a final patch for the computer releases of Fez that included performance improvements, {{as a result of a}} unified codebase under an open source software library, and features such as a speedrun mode.|$|E
5|$|Several enzymes {{can work}} {{together}} in a specific order, creating metabolic pathways. In a metabolic pathway, one enzyme takes the product of another enzyme as a substrate. After the catalytic reaction, the product is then passed <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> enzyme. Sometimes more than one enzyme can catalyze the same reaction in parallel; this can allow more complex regulation: with, for example, a low constant activity provided by one enzyme but an inducible high activity from a second enzyme.|$|E

5|$|Although Tsukudani kept a {{notebook}} with story ideas, she admitted that {{on many occasions}} the theme of a chapter {{was born out of}} her own daydreams. Once she decided on a theme, she had the characters move around in her head and then worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she had a solid grasp on who the characters were, she noted that they moved around for her on their own. Conversely, if the characters were stiff with a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story and moved <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> idea. The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable to draw in the main serialization, as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{started in}} March 2008, and later {{finished}} on August {{in the same}} year. Before principal photography commenced, director Colm McCarthy participated in helicopter shots over London. In each block of episodes, {{the cast and crew}} would often film all scenes held in certain locations at once, for instance all scenes set on the Grid, although taking place in different parts of each episodes, would all be filmed together before moving <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> set. However, the cast had trouble following the storylines with this method. A different Director of Photography was hired in each episode. Because of this, the filming style inside the Grid set changed in every episode. To film public shots, a small filming crew were used as to not attract too much attention from passers by. However, by using the small crew, they and the actors generally film the scenes unnoticed by the public, which the producers felt gave the characters such gravitas.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to demands for more aircrew to meet Australia's commitments to the Korean War and Malayan Emergency, flying {{training in the}} RAAF was again expanded in 1951–52, resulting in the functions of No.1 FTS being split among three separately located units. No.1 FTS itself was renamed No.1 Applied Flying Training School (No.1 AFTS) in March 1952, and assumed responsibility for advanced weapons and combat training on CAC Wirraways. Meanwhile, in November 1951, No.1 Initial Flying Training School (No.1 IFTS) was raised at RAAF Station Archerfield, Queensland, to impart students with general aeronautical and military knowledge, after which they received their flight grading during twelve hours on de Havilland Tiger Moths. Graduate pilots of No.1 IFTS went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> new unit, No.1 Basic Flying Training School (No.1 BFTS) at RAAF Base Uranquinty, New South Wales, where they underwent further aerial instruction that included instrument, formation and night flying, as well as aerobatics and navigation. The first part of their training at No.1 BFTS included 40 hours on Tiger Moths, after which they would fly 50 hours on Wirraways. Successful students finally transferred to No.1 AFTS, before graduating as sergeant pilots.|$|E

5|$|Neilson {{signed a}} new one-year {{contract}} with Cambridge City in July 2009. However, his form also attracted {{a number of}} league clubs and, {{at the start of}} the 2009–10 season he had trials with sides Norwich City, Derby County and Bradford City and was offered a trial with Hartlepool United. Neilson scored twice in a reserve game for Bradford as part of his trial, prompting a bid to buy the winger. Bradford's first bid was turned down but they had an improved bid accepted later the same week. The fee remained undisclosed but included a 25percent sell-on fee entitling Cambridge City to a share of any fee Bradford received for selling Neilson <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> club – a year later, another manager Martin Ling revealed the initial fee that Cambridge received to be £20,000. Neilson had played a further two league games for Cambridge before his departure.|$|E
5|$|Verbal {{explains}} that, {{six weeks}} earlier in New York, {{he and the}} other criminals were arrested on supposedly a trumped-up hijacking charge, and decided to pull another heist to get back at the police. Led by Keaton, a former corrupt policeman, they robbed a group of corrupt cops who transported smugglers in a police convoy. They then went to California to fence the stolen jewels with a criminal named Redfoot, who turned them <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> jewel heist. The quarry turned out to be heroin, and the five had to shoot their way out. Soon after, a lawyer named Kobayashi tells them that Keyser Söze, a Turkish crime lord with a mythical reputation from whom all of the thieves had unwittingly stolen (including Hockney who hijacked the original truck six weeks earlier in New York), had offered them a job: invade a ship manned by a gang of Argentinian drug dealers whom Söze was competing with and destroy the $91 million worth of cocaine that they were transporting.|$|E

25|$|According {{to later}} information, the terrorists planned to kidnap Chen Honglu (the dual Chinese-American citizen) to trade {{him for a}} Taliban {{commander}} in Afghanistan. As the attack unfolded in the Nanga Parbat base camp, Chen burst out of his tent and tackled one of the militants using martial arts techniques. The militant, named Mujeeb, panicked and shot him, destroying {{the main purpose of}} the mission and infuriating the terrorist commanders. The remaining climbers were then tied up and shot. The attackers then walked for five hours to a remote village where they buried their uniforms and had breakfast before a walking <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> village and dispersing.|$|E

Ms Gwyn found that the SIS gave information to John Key's office from where his {{deputy chief of staff}} Phil de Joux passed it <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> John Key employee, Jason Ede. Mr Ede contacted Cameron Slater and they then discussed how an Official Information Act request for the information should be worded. Slater emailed the request while they were still talking on the phone and also provided Slater with draft blog posts attacking Mr Goff. Cameron Slater subsequently used the information to attack former Labour leader, Phil Goff, on his blog.|$|E
25|$|The {{train service}} during the Cornwall Railway {{years had been}} of five {{passenger}} trains each way daily, calling at all stations; there was an additional train each way in the summer months. As well as the stations themselves there were stops at ticket platforms at Truro and Falmouth, and the journey time was two hours 30 minutes Plymouth to Truro (53 miles) and a further half-hour to Falmouth (13 miles). (The service from Penzance to London was by through carriage, shunted from one train <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>another.)</b> For the time being, the Great Western Railway {{made no effort to}} improve the train service, and other issues dominated.|$|E
25|$|If {{a single}} person makes and sells donuts and decides to try jalapeño flavoring, they would likely know {{on the same day}} whether their {{decision}} was good or not, based on the reaction of customers. A decision-maker at a huge company that makes donuts may not know for many months if such a decision worked out or not, especially if their research or marketing team fails to respond in a timely manner. By that time, the decision-makers may very well have moved <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> division or company and thus see no consequence from their decision. This lack of consequences can lead to poor decisions and cause an upward-sloping average cost curve.|$|E

The paper got into financial difficulties and Prescod was able to buy it in partnership with a man called Thomas Harris. Harris allowed him editorial freedom and this led to problems with the establishment, who saw him as challenging the plantocracy.|$|E
25|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the draft, the Dolphins began {{contract}} negotiations with Jake Long. On April 14, Peter King of Sports Illustrated reported that the Dolphins had given Long a deadline to accept their contract offer (believed to be worth less than 2007 No. 1 pick JaMarcus Russell received from the Oakland Raiders); otherwise, they would move <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> prospect. On April 22, the Dolphins officially signed Long to a five-year, $57.75 million contract with $30 million guaranteed, assuring they would take him first overall. On May 19, the Dolphins signed sixth-rounders Jalen Parmele and Lex Hilliard and seventh-rounder Lionel Dotson to contacts. On May 23, sixth-round pick Donald Thomas was signed to a multi-year deal. On July 11, the Dolphins signed third-round pick Kendall Langford to a multi-year deal.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish soon moved <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> castle, {{where they}} were met {{by a host of}} fellow survivors, {{approaching}} from the wreck in Broadhaven of another ship, which had entered that bay without masts. De Leyva's host now numbered 600, and the governor of Connacht, Richard Bingham, chose not to confront them. After some days two ships of the Armada entered Blacksod Bay — the merchantman Nuestra Señora de Begoña (750 tons, 297 men) and the transport Duquesa Santa Ana (900 tons, 23 guns, 357 men). De Leyva and his 600 men boarded Duquesa Santa Ana. Nuestra Señora de Begoña sailed straight for Santander, Spain, arriving some time later. Duquesa Santa Ana, however, was somewhat damaged and it was decided to sail north for Scotland. Stormy weather soon hit Duquesa Santa Ana and she was grounded in Loughros Bay in Donegal, with all aboard reaching shore in what was friendly territory.|$|E
