5|$|The Fifth Amendment {{protects against}} double {{jeopardy}} and self-incrimination and guarantees {{the rights to}} due process, grand jury screening of criminal indictments, and compensation for the seizure <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>property</b> under eminent domain.

Arizona (1966), which established that defendants must be informed of their rights to an attorney and against self-incrimination prior to interrogation by police.|$|E
5|$|By 1910 Russian émigrés met {{regularly}} at the Anarchist Club in Jubilee Street, Stepney. Many {{of its members}} were not anarchists, and the club became a meeting and social venue for the Russian émigré diaspora, {{most of whom were}} Jewish. The small group of Latvians who became involved in the events at Houndsditch and Sidney Street were not all anarchists—although anarchist literature was later found among their possessions. Members of the group were probably revolutionaries who had been radicalised by their experiences in Russia. All had extreme left-wing political views and believed the expropriation <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>property</b> was a valid practice.|$|E

40|$|Poor {{protection}} <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>properties</b> – {{manifested in}} the risks of expropriation and discrimination – has limited the access to bank loans by private enterprises in developing and transition economies. Under those circumstances, private entrepreneurs have resorted to ingenious ways of enhancing the de facto protection <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>properties</b> through political participation and philanthropic activities. Using a data set <b>of</b> 3, 073 <b>private</b> enterprises in China, this paper empirically investigates the effects of formal and de facto property rights protection on the access to bank loans...|$|R

5|$|From {{the turn}} of the century, gang warfare persisted in the Whitechapel and Aldgate areas of London between groups of Bessarabians and {{refugees}} from Odessa, and various revolutionary factions were active in the area. One event, the Tottenham Outrage of January 1909, by two revolutionary Russians in London—Paul Helfeld and Jacob Lepidus—was an attempt to rob a payroll van, which left two dead and twenty injured. The event used a tactic often employed by revolutionary groups in Russia: the expropriation or theft <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>property</b> to fund radical activities.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the hurricane, the road {{networks}} of the affected countries remained severely disrupted for extended periods of time, hampering relief efforts in badly flooded regions. Government and emergency officials opened shelters and distributed food for the thousands that had lost their homes or sources of income. Throughout Central America and Mexico, 116people lost their lives and 16 others went missing. The disaster left swaths <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>property,</b> infrastructure, and farmland in complete ruins, leading to damage costs of more than $170million (1993USD).|$|E

As {{a result of this}} incident and others involving crimes committed by U.S. military personnel in Japan, both countries entered into negotiations aimed at modifying the SOFA in July 2003; ultimately, no changes were made to the agreement. In 2005, Brown {{was arrested and charged with}} a separate kidnapping in the United States. He was demoted and involuntarily retired from the military in 2006 and at his trial in 2009 entered an Alford plea, receiving probation on the felony conviction.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{proposals}} to extend the O-Bahn to Golden Grove or build other routes, however none have progressed beyond consultation. An extension to Golden Grove would require the acquisition of extensive tracts <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>property,</b> due to the absence of an available corridor. Population increase in the area is negligible, although sprawl continues from Tea Tree Plaza Interchange for another eight kilometres to the Adelaide Hills. The current route was built with an allowance for a station at Grand Junction Road but it has not been built.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of March 18, 1990, guards at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston {{admitted}} two men posing as police officers responding to a disturbance call. Once inside, the men tied up the guards and, over the next hour, stole 13 works of art valued at $500 millionthe largest-value theft <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>property</b> in history. Despite efforts by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and multiple probes around the world, no arrests have been made and no works have been recovered. The museum initially offered a reward of $5 million for information leading to their recovery, but in 2017 this was doubled temporarily to $10 million with an expiration date set {{to the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|The {{responsibilities}} of the Provincial Assembly included defining provincial and municipal budgets and levying the taxes necessary to support them; providing primary and secondary schools (higher education was {{the responsibility of the}} national government); oversight and control of provincial and municipal expenditures; and providing for law enforcement and maintenance of police forces. The Assemblies also controlled the creation and abolishment of, and salaries for, positions within provincial and municipal civil services. The nomination, suspension and dismissal of civil servants was reserved for the president (governor) of the province, but how and under what circumstances he could exercise these prerogatives was delineated by the Assembly. The expropriation <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>property</b> (with due monetary compensation) for provincial or municipal interests was also a right of the Assembly. In effect, the Provincial Assembly could enact any kind of law—with no ratification by Parliament—so long as such local laws did not violate or encroach upon the Constitution. However, provinces were not permitted to legislate in the areas of criminal law, criminal procedure laws, civil rights and obligations, the armed forces, the national budget or matters concerning national interests, such as foreign relations.|$|E

40|$|The California Supreme Court held, in the {{landmark}} case California Building Industry Association v. City of San Jose, that the City of San Jose’s inclusionary housing ordinance {{is a valid}} exercise of the City’s police power. In the context of legal precedent, the California Supreme Court decided the case correctly by applying a lenient standard of review rather than a searching analysis because the ordinance was a legislative decision. Following an overview of legal precedent {{and analysis of the}} California Supreme Court’s decision, this Comment argues that the court’s holding weakens constitutional protections <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>properties.</b> This Comment calls {{for the end of the}} continued distinction between administrative and legislative policies because both actions warrant the same fears that merit a searching analysis to safeguard the constitutional protections <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>properties...</b>|$|R

5|$|Zoning {{and land}} use controversies, common {{throughout}} Bellaire's history, resulted in the 1977 recall of the mayor and three council members. The City of Bellaire voted against banning smoking in bars and restaurants on Monday January 15, 2007. Mayor Cindy Siegel and Pat McLaughlan, one council member, voted for the ban, while the other five members, including Peggy Faulk, voted against the ban. The National Restaurant Association asked Bellaire to consider adopting a smoking ban {{to put it in}} sync with the City of Houston, which adopted a similar ordinance in 2005. In December 2009 the city voted to ban texting while driving. Bans of texting while driving were passed in Bellaire and West University Place, Texas within hours of one another. In 2010 the city voted 5-2 to ban the feeding of cats on public property and establish a rule requiring the permission of the owner of a piece <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>property</b> in order to feed cats on private property. The city received negative e-mail feedback from various locations, including Switzerland.|$|E

Regarding public policy, it gives primacy to the private sector as the central agent for action, necessitates the social and economic benefits for private initiatives and competition, and [...] "legitimizes the public consequences <b>of</b> <b>private</b> action".|$|R
