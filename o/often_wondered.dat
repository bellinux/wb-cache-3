25|$|He {{never felt}} {{disturbed}} when others spoke to him, sought advice or discussed matters. He had visitors ranging from foreign missionaries to local scholars, who had serious discussions {{with him on}} religious matters. His publications were highly rated by scholars. They <b>often</b> <b>wondered</b> how a non-Brahmin could master such profound knowledge of Hinduism. His thirst for knowledge and his ascetic habits ‘made his contemporaries acknowledge him as the most formidable intellectual in the Durbar,’ formed by the group of ascetics in the New Dispensation after Keshub Chunder Sen’s death.|$|E

[...] Before his 1967 retirement, he began writing his [...] "Memoirs of My Work in the Cipher Bureau of Section II of the [...] General Staff", which were {{purchased}} by the Polish Military Historical Institute, in Warsaw. [...] Rejewski had <b>often</b> <b>wondered</b> what use Alan Turing (who in early 1940 had visited the Polish cryptologists at PC Bruno outside Paris) and the British at Bletchley Park had ultimately made of the Polish discoveries and inventions. For nearly three decades after the war, little was publicly known due to a ban imposed in 1945 by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. [...] In a 1967 book Władysław Kozaczuk, associated with the Military Historical Institute, disclosed Poland's breaking of the German Enigma ciphers.|$|E

500|$|Feeling unsettled, Etty left Rome for Venice, {{intending}} to remain there for 10 {{days and then}} return to England. Evans preferred to remain in Rome, so Etty travelled alone, pausing briefly in Florence and in Ferrara (where he stopped to kiss the armchair of Ludovico Ariosto). The painter Charles Lock Eastlake, then resident in Rome, had provided Etty with a letter of introduction to Harry D'Orville, British Vice consul in Venice; D'Orville was so impressed with Etty that he arranged for him to stay in his own house, rather than in lodgings. Etty had long considered Venice his spiritual home and [...] "the hope and idol of my professional life", and had <b>often</b> <b>wondered</b> why, given its artistic importance, so few English travellers visited the city. He was not disappointed. Throughout the remainder of his life, he would look back on his visit to Venice with great fondness, writing shortly before his death that [...] "Venezia, cara Venezia! thy pictured glories haunt my fancy now!" ...|$|E
500|$|After {{a year at}} RADA, Morrissey {{went back}} to Liverpool to perform in WCPC at the Liverpool Playhouse. He then did Le Cid and Twelfth Night with Cheek by Jowl, and spent two years with the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), principally with {{director}} Deborah Warner for whom he played the Bastard in King John in 1988. He saw the role as a learning opportunity, as he had <b>often</b> <b>wondered</b> at RADA if he would ever {{have the chance to}} act in classical theatre. His performance has been described as [...] "the most contentious characterisation of the production"; he received negative critical reaction from Daily Telegraph and Independent critics, but a positive opinion from the Financial Times. In The Guardian, Nicholas de Jongh wrote, [...] "The Bastard, who has the most complex syntax in early Shakespeare, half defeats David Morrissey. His slurred, sometimes unintelligible diction helps to deflate the Bastard, but his bawling rhetoric strikes as mere sham rather than fierce plain speaking." [...] Morrissey also spent time with the National, where he played the title role in Peer Gynt (1990). Michael Billington praised the unkempt energy of his performance. During this time, he lived on the housing estate in White City, where he and his flatmates were the frequent victims of burglars.|$|E
500|$|Despite the character's small {{appearances}} in Part II, {{most of them}} were well received. The way Orochimaru angers Naruto Uzumaki in their battle as well as how he manages events ever since his reintroduction have been deemed as [...] "near perfectly" [...] by Mania's Chris Beveridge. Orochimaru's fight against Sasuke in later parts from the series was praised by Mangalife's Park Cooper due to how it changes [...] "the nature of things" [...] in a short time. While agreeing with Cooper, Beveridge found that the fight did not bring a certain end to Orochimaru which he thought it would have made it more entertaining. On the other hand, Beveridge liked how during the fight between the two a flashback showed Orochimaru's backstory in Konoha, which helped in expanding his character. His apparent redemption to follow Sasuke in later parts of the story was criticized by writer Jason Thompson during a review of the manga. On the other hand, Bryce Coulter from the Fandom Post found Orochimaru's change based on Sasuke's new interest intriguing due to the future possibilities of becoming Konohagakure's ally. Ramsey Isler from IGN still praised the relationship between Orochimaru and his ally Kabuto Yakushi as the former <b>often</b> <b>wondered</b> if Kabuto was ever going to betray him. In the final episodes of the anime Naruto Shippuden Orochimaru made small cameos during the preparations for Naruto and Hinata's wedding which were found hilarious by Amy Mcnulty from Anime News Network.|$|E

2500|$|Lucas {{originally}} had Cushing {{in mind for}} the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi, but Lucas believed that [...] "his lean features" [...] would be better employed in the role of Grand Moff Tarkin instead.

I feel he will be fondly remembered for the next 350 years at least." [...] Cushing, commenting on his role, joked: [...] "I've <b>often</b> <b>wondered</b> what a 'Grand Moff' was.

There are a few similar rides still standing in a handful of major amusement parks, the most common name being the Slingshot found at many Six Flags parks, but they are upcharge attractions (an additional charge to admission) due to insurance issues. At Action Park, the extra fee was only $5. This particular ride was open from 1993 to 1995.
