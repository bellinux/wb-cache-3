5|$|Croatian {{authorities}} {{suspect that}} a further 61 individuals killed at Ovčara were buried there as well. They suspect {{one or more}} additional mass graves exist in the general area, or that the bodies originally buried at the site were moved to a secondary grave. Nevenka Nekić, the Croatian author <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> Nicolier, claims that an additional shallow grave was excavated at Ovčara in November 1991 and that Nicolier and 60 others were buried there. According to her, they were exhumed by Croatian Serb authorities {{and moved to a}} secondary location in early 1992 because the grave was so shallow that body parts protruded through the ground surface.|$|E

25|$|The Comoros {{also served}} as his {{logistic}} base for military operations in Mozambique and Angola. He was then supported by Paris, as the Comoros provided France for a base {{to get around the}} embargo imposed on South Africa because of its government's policy of apartheid. Denard accumulated considerable holdings in the Comoros, composed of hotels, lands, and the presidential guard.

25|$|In May 2005, the English {{journalist}} David Rex-Taylor, {{a bridge}} player and publisher, claimed that Reese {{had made a}} confession to him forty years earlier, one that {{was not to be}} revealed until 2005 and after he and Schapiro were dead. The purported confession claimed that Reese and Schapiro were indeed signalling, but only to show that such signaling was possible (and so were not actually paying attention to each other's signals), purportedly as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> cheating (which was abandoned after the scandal broke). Although this explanation could conceivably reconcile the use of finger signals with the absence of evidence from bidding or play, there is no corroborating evidence to support this account. In contrast, Schapiro's widow claims he continued to deny the accusations to his death.|$|E

25|$|For years figures {{belonging}} to the right-wing claimed to be wrongfully accused by Mapai of being responsible for Arlosoroff's death. About fifty years after the murder, following the publication <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> the assassination by Shabtai Teveth in 1982, the Israeli government, now led by Menachem Begin, established a formal investigative committee. As the first Israeli Prime Minister elected from the Revisionist movement, Begin had taken offense at a suggestion in Teveth's book that a Revisionist acquitted in court for Arlosoroff's murder may have actually been responsible after all. The Judicial Commission of Enquiry was led by the former High court of Justice Judge David Bachor. Its purpose was to decide whether Rosenblatt and Stavsky were responsible for assassinating Arlosoroff, or not. The committee decided unanimously that Rosenblatt and Stavsky {{had nothing to do}} with the murder. The committee was inconclusive about the identity of the real murderers or whether or not the murder was politically motivated.|$|E
25|$|De Reis van Sint Brandaen (Dutch for The Voyage of Saint Brandan) {{is a sort}} of a Christianized Odyssey, {{written in}} the 12th century that {{describes}} the legend of Sint Brandaen, a monk from Galway, and his voyage around the world for nine years. Scholars believe the Dutch legend derived from a now lost middle High German text combined with Celtic elements from Ireland and combines Christian and fairy tale elements. The journey was begun as a punishment by an angel. The angel saw Brandaen did not believe the truth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> the miracles of creation and saw Brandaen throw it into the fire. The angel tells him that truth has been destroyed. On his journeys Brandaen encounters the wonders and horrors of the world, people in distant lands with swine heads, dog legs and wolf teeth carrying bows and arrows, and an enormous fish that encircles the ship by holding its tail in its mouth. The English poem Life of Saint Brandan is an English derivative.|$|E
