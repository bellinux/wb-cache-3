500|$|By early 1943, Kenney was {{convinced}} that Wurtsmith had [...] "made good" [...] in the Papuan Campaign, {{and he took the}} papers recommending Wurtsmith's promotion to MacArthur, who promised to approve it and sent it in to Washington, DC. One of MacArthur's staff quipped that he hoped Wurtsmith was over 21. Wurtsmith was actually 36; but MacArthur, who had been promoted to the rank of brigadier general at age 37, icily replied, [...] "We promote them <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> efficiency, not age." [...] Wurtsmith was duly promoted on 8 February 1943. He also became {{one of a handful of}} American officers to be decorated by the Australian government, being awarded the Commander of the Order of the British Empire for [...] "excellence of training and direction of fighter operations in New Guinea". The award was eventually presented by General Sir Thomas Blamey on Leyte in March 1945.|$|E
500|$|The {{winners were}} {{announced}} during the awards ceremony on March 5, 2006. Several notable achievements by multiple individuals and films {{occurred during the}} ceremony. Crash was the first Best Picture winner since 1976's Rocky to win only three Oscars. Best Director winner Ang Lee became the first non-Caucasian winner of that category. For this {{first time since the}} 34th ceremony held in 1962, all four acting winners were first-time nominees. Best Supporting Actor winner George Clooney was the fifth person to receive acting, directing, and screenwriting nominations in the same year and the first person to achieve this feat for two different films. By virtue of his nominations for both Memoirs of a Geisha and Munich, composer John Williams earned a total of 45 nominations tying him with Alfred Newman as the second most nominated individual in Oscar history. [...] "It's Hard <b>out</b> <b>Here</b> <b>for</b> a Pimp" [...] became the second rap song to win Best Original Song and the first such song to be performed at an Oscars ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{possibility}} that suggests the secondary {{use of the}} mound and fits with its more recent local names, {{is that it was}} the site of the Justice Hill where proclamations of the Lainshaw Castle or possibly the Lambroughton Baronial Court's judgements and sentence was carried <b>out</b> <b>here.</b> <b>For</b> serious crimes the men were hung here and women were drowned in the Annick Water below the mound. This situation, known as the feudal Barony right of 'pit and gallows' existed at many other sites, such as at Kilmarnock, Aiket, Ardrossan, Dalry, Largs, Carnell, Giffen and Mugdock where the castle, mound and lochan have this scenario attached to their history. The Boyds, Lords of Kilmarnock, had their gallows at Gallows-Knowe which stood in Wellington street. Often the mounds were wooded and a dule tree may have been used as the gallows. Brehons or Judges administered justice from these 'Court Hills', especially in the highlands. Aiket castle had a [...] "court hill" [...] mound nearby, as did Riccarton which is now the site of a church and the village of Tinwald exists near Dumfries its name is derived from the same root as that of the famous Tynwald parliament site in the Isle of Man.|$|E
60|$|EILEEN (sadly). It doesn't seem so {{important}} now, somehow. I {{suppose it was}} silly of me to drag you <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> just <b>for</b> that. It can't mean anything to you--much.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I can't say how far I'll go. I'm undecided. Just came <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> {{a little}} fresh air, you know, with no {{definite}} plans," [...] explained the stranger.|$|E
6000|$|... "He isn't {{much more}} than a boy, but I'd like to know if he is <b>out</b> <b>here</b> only <b>for</b> {{pleasure}} or on business," [...] said the man to himself. [...] "We can't be too careful in our work," [...] and he smiled grimly.|$|R
5000|$|The Wasteland, a huge area {{surrounding}} The Jungle. Not {{many animals}} live <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> except <b>for</b> birds of prey, insects, porcupines and baboons, such as Mahra {{and her three}} sons, who live there. It is also where an evil dictator turtle lives.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{about an}} hour ago. I told them that you had telephoned that {{you were on the}} way home, so they said they'd remain <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> {{watching}} <b>for</b> you. I showed them what room they were to occupy," [...] added the lady of the mansion.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{nothing more}} to know, really," [...] said Mrs. Bradley, with a {{superior}} air. [...] "He's undoubtedly the son of some Englishman of fortune, sent <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> his health." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shut up, will you?" [...] shouted Coffee, who plainly did {{not take}} kindly to that epithet before the {{gathering}} crowd. [...] "I'm no thief... Men get shot <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> saying less than that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now we {{had better}} come to an understanding," [...] said Dan Baxter, as he warmed his hands. [...] "We all know what we are <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>for,</b> {{so there is no}} use in mincing matters." ...|$|E

60|$|Now she {{frequently}} came <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> {{a melancholy}} saunter after dinner, and to-night {{was such an}} occasion. Swithin went forward, and met her at nearly {{the spot where he}} had dropped the lens some nights earlier.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; but {{her father}} was an educated man--a civil engineer, she tells me, who came <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> {{one of the big}} railroads. He was {{something}} of an inventor, too. That's the reason he died poor--they nearly all do." ...|$|E

60|$|Ultimately, against every {{possibility}} of the case, Boon decided that the President of his conference must be Hallery. And he wrote his presidential address.

5000|$|Death, death! Now it's all I dream about.
