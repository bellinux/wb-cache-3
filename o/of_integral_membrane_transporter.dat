40|$|Glucose {{metabolism}} {{is vital}} to most mammalian cells, and the passage of glucose across cell membranes is facilitated by a family <b>of</b> <b>integral</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>transporter</b> proteins, the GLUTs. There are currently 14 members of the SLC 2 family of GLUTs, several {{of which have been}} the focus of this series of reviews. The subject of the present review is GLUT 3, which, as implied by its name, was the third glucose transporter to be cloned (Kayano T, Fukumoto H, Eddy RL, Fan YS, Byers MG, Shows TB, Bell GI. J Biol Chem 263 : 15245 – 15248, 1988) and was originally designated as the neuronal GLUT. The overriding question that drove the early work on GLUT 3 was why would neurons need a separate glucose transporter isoform? What is it about GLUT 3 that specifically suits the needs of the highly metabolic and oxidative neuron with its high glucose demand? More recently, GLUT 3 has been studied in other cell types with quite specific requirements for glucose, including sperm, preimplantation embryos, circulating white blood cells, and an array of carcinoma cell lines. The last are sufficiently varied and numerous to warrant a review of their own and will not be discussed here. However, for each of these cases, the same questions apply. Thus, the objective of this review is to discuss the properties and tissue and cellular localization of GLUT 3 as well as the features of expression, function, and regulation that distinguish it from the rest of its family and make it uniquely suited as the mediator of glucose delivery to these specific cells...|$|E

40|$|Multiple {{sequence}} alignments {{are often}} used to reveal functionally important residues within a protein family. They can be particularly useful for the identification of key residues that determine functional differences between protein subfamilies. We present a new entropy-based method, Sequence Harmony (SH) that accurately detects subfamily-specific positions from a multiple sequence alignment. The SH algorithm implements a novel formula, able to score compositional differences between subfamilies, without imposing conservation, in a simple manner on an intuitive scale. We compare our method with the most important published methods, i. e. AMAS, TreeDet and SDP-pred, using three well-studied protein families: the receptor-binding domain (MH 2) of the Smad family of transcription factors, the Ras-superfamily of small GTPases and the MIP-family <b>of</b> <b>integral</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>transporters.</b> We demonstrate that SH accurately selects known functional sites with higher coverage than the other methods for these test-cases. This shows that compositional differences between protein subfamilies provide sufficient basis for identification of functional sites. In addition, SH selects a number of sites of unknown function that could be interesting candidates for further experimental investigation...|$|R
40|$|Members of the ABC (for ATP binding cassette) {{superfamily}} <b>of</b> <b>integral</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>transporters</b> {{function in}} cellular detoxification, cell-to-cell signaling, and channel regulation. More recently, {{members of the}} multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (MDR/PGP) subfamily of ABC transporters {{have been shown to}} function in the transport of the phytohormone auxin in both monocots and dicots. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis thaliana MDR/PGP PGP 4 functions in the basipetal redirection of auxin from the root tip. Reporter gene studies showed that PGP 4 was strongly expressed in root cap and epidermal cells. PGP 4 exhibits apolar plasma membrane localization in the root cap and polar localization in tissues above. Root gravitropic bending and elongation as well as lateral root formation were reduced in pgp 4 mutants compared with the wild type. pgp 4 exhibited reduced basipetal auxin transport in roots and a small decrease in shoot-to-root transport consistent with a partial loss of the redirective auxin sink in the root. Seedlings overexpressing PGP 4 exhibited increased shoot-to-root auxin transport. Heterologous expression of PGP 4 in mammalian cells resulted in 1 -N-naphthylthalamic acid–reversible net uptake of [3 H]indole- 3 -acetic acid. These results indicate that PGP 4 functions primarily in the uptake of redirected or newly synthesized auxin in epidermal root cells...|$|R
40|$|SecA, the {{peripheral}} subunit of E. coli preprotein translocase, alternates between a membrane inserted and a deinserted state {{as part of}} the catalytic cycle of preprotein translocation. When SecA is complexed with SecY/E and preprotein, ATP drives a profound conformational change, leading to membrane insertion of a 30 kDa domain of SecA. The inserted domain is protease-inaccessible from the cytosolic side of the membrane, but becomes accessible upon membrane disruption. Concomitant with 30 kDa domain insertion, approximately 20 aminoacyl residues of the preprotein are translocated. Additional ATP, which may be hydrolyzed at the second ATP site of SecA, releases the translocated preprotein and allows the 30 kDa domain to deinsert, whence it can exchange with cytosolic SecA. Thus, SecA is the mobile subunit <b>of</b> an <b>integral</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>transporter,</b> consuming ATP during both the insertion and deinsertion phases of its catalytic cycle while guiding preprotein segments across the membrane. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The Escherichia coli proP P 2 promoter, which {{directs the}} {{expression}} <b>of</b> an <b>integral</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>transporter</b> <b>of</b> proline, glycine betaine, and other osmoprotecting compounds, is induced upon entry into stationary phase to protect cells from osmotic shock. Transcription from the P 2 promoter is completely dependent on RpoS (ς 38) and Fis. Fis activates transcription by binding {{to a site}} centered at − 41, which overlaps the promoter, where it makes a specific contact with the C-terminal domain of the α subunit of RNA polymerase (α-CTD). We show here that Fis and cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP) -cAMP collaborate to activate transcription synergistically in vitro. Coactivation both in vivo and in vitro is dependent on CRP binding to a site centered at − 121. 5, but CRP without Fis provides little activation. The contribution by CRP requires the correct helical phasing of the CRP site and a functional activation region 1 on CRP. We provide evidence that coactivation is achieved by Fis and CRP independently contacting {{each of the two}} α-CTDs. Efficient transcription in vitro requires that both activators must be preincubated with the DNA prior to addition of RNA polymerase...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{key roles}} <b>of</b> <b>integral</b> <b>membrane</b> {{proteins}} as <b>transporters</b> and channels, {{it is necessary}} to understand their structures and, hence, mechanisms and regulation at the molecular level. Membrane proteins represent 30 % of all proteins of currently sequenced genomes. Paradoxically, however, only 2 % of crystal structures deposited in the protein data bank are of membrane proteins, and very few of these are at high resolution (better than 2 A ˚). The great disparity between our understanding of soluble proteins and our understanding of membrane proteins is because of the practical problems of working with membrane proteins – specifically, difficulties in expression, purification and crystallization. Thus, computational modeling has been utilized extensively to make crucial advances in understanding membrane protein structure and function...|$|R
40|$|Glucose {{and other}} {{carbohydrates}} are transported into cells using {{members of a}} family <b>of</b> <b>integral</b> <b>membrane</b> glucose <b>transporter</b> (GLUT) molecules. To date 14 members of this family, also called the solute carrier 2 A proteins have been identified which are divided {{on the basis of}} transport characteristics and sequence similarities into several families (Classes 1 to 3). The expression of these different receptor subtypes varies between different species, tissues and cellular subtypes and each has differential sensitivities to stimuli such as insulin. The liver is a contributor to metabolic carbohydrate homeostasis and is a major site for synthesis, storage and redistribution of carbohydrates. Situations in which the balance of glucose homeostasis is upset such as diabetes or the metabolic syndrome can lead metabolic disturbances that drive chronic organ damage and failure, confirming the importance of understanding the molecular regulation of hepatic glucose homeostasis. There is a considerable literature describing the expression and function of receptors that regulate glucose uptake and release by hepatocytes, the most import cells in glucose regulation and glycogen storage. However there is less appreciation of the roles of GLUTs expressed by non parenchymal cell types within the liver, all of which require carbohydrate to function. A better understanding of the detailed cellular distribution of GLUTs in human liver tissue may shed light on mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis. This review summarises the available literature on hepatocellular expression of GLUTs in health and disease and highlights areas where further investigation is required...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntegral {{membrane}} proteins act {{as critical}} cellular components and are important drug targets. However, difficulties in producing membrane proteins have hampered investigations of structure and function. In vivo production systems are often limited by cell toxicity, and previous in vitro approaches have required unnatural folding pathways using detergents or lipid solutions. To overcome these limitations, we present an improved cell-free expression system which produces high yields <b>of</b> <b>integral</b> <b>membrane</b> proteins {{without the use}} of detergents or refolding steps. Our cell-free reaction activates an Escherichia coli-derived cell extract for transcription and translation. Purified E. coli inner membrane vesicles supply membrane-bound components and the lipid environment required for insertion and folding. Using this system, we demonstrated successful synthesis <b>of</b> two complex <b>integral</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>transporters,</b> the tetracycline pump (TetA) and mannitol permease (MtlA), in yields of 570 ± 50  μg/mL and 130 ± 30  μg/mL of vesicle-associated protein, respectively. These yields are up to 400 times typical in vivo concentrations. Insertion and folding of these proteins are verified by sucrose flotation, protease digestion, and activity assays. Whereas TetA incorporates efficiently into vesicle membranes with over two-thirds of the synthesized protein being inserted, MtlA yields appear to be limited by insufficient concentrations of a membrane-associated chaperone...|$|R
40|$|The gonococcal {{transferrin}} receptor {{is composed}} of two distinct proteins, TbpA and TbpB. TbpA {{is a member of}} the TonB-dependent family <b>of</b> <b>integral</b> outer <b>membrane</b> <b>transporters,</b> while TbpB is lipid modified and thought to be peripherally surface exposed. We previously proposed a hypothetical topology model for gonococcal TbpA that was based upon computer predictions and similarity with other TonB-dependent transporters for which crystal structures have been determined. In the present study, the hemagglutinin epitope was inserted into TbpA to probe the surface topology of this protein and secondarily to test the functional impacts of site-specific mutagenesis. Twelve epitope insertion mutants were constructed, five of which allowed us to confirm the surface exposure of loops 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10. In contrast to the predictions set forth by the hypothetical model, insertion into the plug region resulted in an epitope that was surface accessible, while epitope insertions into two putative loops (9 and 11) were not surface accessible. Insertions into putative loop 3 and β strand 9 abolished transferrin binding and utilization, and the plug insertion mutant exhibited decreased transferrin-binding affinity concomitant with an inability to utilize it. Insertion into putative β strand 16 generated a mutant that was able to bind transferrin normally but that was unable to mediate utilization. Mutants with insertions into putative loops 2, 9, and 11 maintained wild-type binding affinity but could utilize only transferrin in the presence of TbpB. This is the first demonstration of the ability of TbpB to compensate for a mutation in TbpA...|$|R

For this experiment, a membrane preparation with only minor contamination by soluble proteins was prepared. From this membrane preparation {{a number of}} peripheral membrane proteins were identified by the classical two dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE) approach, but identification <b>of</b> <b>integral</b> <b>membrane</b> proteins largely failed with only a very few being identified. By use of a fluorescently labeled membrane preparation, we document that this is caused by an irreversible precipitation of the membrane proteins upon isoelectric focusing (IEF). Attempts to overcome this problem by using alternative IEFmethods and IEF strip solubilisation techniques were not successful, and we conclude that the classical 2 -DE approach is not suited for the identification <b>of</b> <b>integral</b> <b>membrane</b> proteins.
