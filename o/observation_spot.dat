40|$|A {{dedicated}} {{study on}} JET-ILW, deploying {{two types of}} ICRH antennas and spectroscopic <b>observation</b> <b>spots</b> at two outboard, beryllium limiters, has provided insight on long-range (up to 6 m) RFenhanced plasma-surface interactions (RF-PSI) due to near-antenna electric fields. To aid {{in the interpretation of}} optical emission measurements of these effects, the antenna near-fields are computed using the TOPICA code, specifically run for the ITER-like antenna (ILA); similar modelling already existed for the standard JET antennas (A 2). In the experiment, both antennas were operated in current drive mode, as RF-PSI tends to be higher in this phasing and at similar power (∼ 0. 5 MW). When sweeping the edge magnetic field pitch angle, peaked RF-PSI effects, in the form of 2 - 4 fold increase in the local Be source,are consistently measured with the <b>observation</b> <b>spots</b> magnetically connect to regions of TOPICAL-calculated high near-fields, particularly at the near-antenna limiters. It is also found that similar RF-PSI effects are produced by the two types of antenna on similarly distant limiters. Although this mapping of calculated near-fields to enhanced RF-PSI gives only qualitative interpretion of the data, the present dataset is expected to provide a sound experimental basis for emerging RF sheath simulation model validation...|$|R

40|$|A B S T RA C T: Analytical {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} was applied to some authigenic chlorites occurring as grain coatings in sandstones. Compositional variation proved to be relatively slight: all were magnesian chamosites. The coating chlorites were often intimately mixed with extremely fine-grained (0. 01 - 0. 2 #m) hematite but analytical 'contamination ' was avoided because of the very high resolution of both <b>observation</b> (<b>spot</b> location) and analysis. One example of a water sensitive ('swelling chlorite') coating was also studied. This proved {{to have a very}} much more variable composition even within a single section. The coating appeared to include both chloritic and vermiculitic components. The effect of this on structural formulae is discussed and a model proposed inwhich the 'talc ' layer may be common to both components. Chlorite is found as an authigenic mineral in many sandstones. It usually occurs as grain coatings, less commonly filling pores. It has been suggested that these coatings can be so continuous that they prevent overgrowth of framework grains from saturated porewaters, thereby preserving porosity. The chlorite structure consists of a 2 : 1 layer (talc-like) plus an interlayer hydroxide sheet (Bailey, 1980) which in sedimentary examples is iron-rich. This is readily attacke...|$|E

This program is performed under CNES-NASA cooperation. The JASON satellite will ensure a continuous observation of the oceans to improve our knowledge of global ocean circulation. The JASON- 1 satellite {{will be the first}} to use the new family of small, low-cost space platforms called PROTEUS. The PROTEUS program has been given an high priority by the French Space Agency. It is the first program to be led in close partnership between the Industry (Aerospatiale) and CNES. It aims at providing access to space at a very attractive cost, and can support a wide variety of applications. There are already serious missions candidates like COROT (star <b>observation),</b> <b>SPOT</b> follow-on. The JASON satellite is a combination of flight proven and innovative technologies. It will provide at least the same performances as TOPEX, but at 1 / 5 th of the mass and power! This is the result of the extensive use of miniaturization and electronics integration and packaging. In order to develop the satellite at an affordable cost, efforts on organization, engineering, procurement are deemed necessary. Reduction in launch cost is achieved by using the Delta 2 launcher in a dual launch configuration...|$|E

This area was surrounded with secondary forest, rubber plantation, oil palm plantation, river and stream which help in contributes to the variety of bird species. The aim {{of the study was}} to estimate the diversity index of birds in Gunung Reng. Field study was conducted from July 2016 to September 2016. In bird sampling, due to the small area in Gunung Reng, one potential spot was taken to observe bird species and all the birds observed in range of 40 m from the <b>observation</b> <b>spot</b> were taken. The data recorded was analyzed by using Shannon-Wiener Index, Pielou’s Evenness Index, and Margalef’s Richness Index. A total frequency recorded in the study area was 56 with 17 species of birds from 16 families. The highest frequency recorded was Barn Swallow as there was caves in Gunung Reng that act as their home and nesting place. Then, the analysis illustrates that bird community in term of species diversity was 2. 39, the evenness of bird species was 0. 84 and the species richness was 3. 97. This value shows low bird diversity and low species richness. However, the bird species in Gunung Reng was well distributed. As a conclusion, the diversity of bird in Gunung Reng was quiet low because of human disturbance of their habitat and it was recommended to make a further research of this study because there might be more bird species would be observed and identified in Gunung Reng...|$|E

In the SPA model, the Classification Standard of Lake Eutrophication and evaluation indices of monitoring sites in Baiyangdian Lake were considered as a set pair, and the eutrophication levels of monitoring sites were depicted by a five-element connection degree. Our results demonstrated that the key limiting factors that caused eutrophication were TN, COD and SD. According {{to the principle of}} the maximum membership degree and the analysis of the set pair situation, we concluded that Nanliuzhuang experienced hypereutrophy, Zaolinzhuang eutrophy, and the others upper-mesotrophy. Furthermore, the water quality of the seven <b>observation</b> <b>spots</b> was, from better to worse, Caiputai, Duancun, Wangjiazhai, Shaochedian, Guangdianzhangzhuang, Zaolinzhuang and Nanliuzhuang.

The objectives of this research were to diagnose diseases occurring on physic nut in Lampung Province and to determine their intensity.

Disease intensity, whether expressed as disease incidence or severity, was recorded from plant samples determined by making diagonal lines across the field on which five <b>observation</b> <b>spots</b> were made. On each spot, five plant samples were observed. Specimens were also collected and placed individually in plastic bags for laboratory observation. The diseases found on physic nut in Lampung Province were cercospora leaf spot, alternaria leaf spot, fusarium wilt, and bacterial wilt. In addition, leaf malformation first thought to be viral disease was commonly found in many locations. Further mechanical transmission failed to produce similar symptom on tested plants and higher population of mites were found on malformed leaves than that in normal leaves. Based on the disease distribution and intensity, the most likely threatening disease in physic nut cultivation is bacterial wilt.
