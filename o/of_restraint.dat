5|$|Emperors {{could choose}} whether to {{supervise}} the policy bureaucracy or to pursue scholarship, cults, hobbies, or women instead. However, Frederick W. Mote argues that most Song emperors – who spent much of their childhood confined and isolated within a luxurious palace – were aloof conformists detached {{from the world of}} normal affairs and thus relied on officialdom to administer the government. While the mainstream view is that the Song court exercised the highest degree <b>of</b> <b>restraint</b> and courtesy towards civil officials, the new protocol of enhanced deferential treatment by officials towards the emperor during conferences and meetings further eroded the emperor's close contact with his ministers.|$|E

But due to the policy <b>of</b> <b>restraint</b> adopted by the Italian Navy, Dante Alighieri and the other battleships of the Italian fleet saw no action. Financial limitations in the post-war period forced the navy to scrap the ship to reduce the naval budget. The ship was accordingly stricken on 1 July 1928 and sold for scrap.|$|E

She {{obtained}} an Order <b>of</b> <b>Restraint,</b> and Arantes returned to Portugal, with Rowling filing for divorce in August 1994. She began a teacher training course in August 1995 at the Moray House School of Education, at Edinburgh University, after completing her first novel while living on state benefits. She wrote in many cafés, especially Nicolson's Café (owned by her brother-in-law), and the Elephant House, wherever she could get Jessica to fall asleep. In a 2001 BBC interview, Rowling denied the rumour that she wrote in local cafés to escape from her unheated flat, pointing out that it had heating. One of the reasons she wrote in cafés was that taking her baby {{out for a walk}} {{was the best way to}} make her fall asleep.|$|E

The use <b>of</b> <b>restraints</b> on {{individuals}} {{with special needs}} has been increasing over the past decade, especially among law enforcement agencies. Even though, improper use <b>of</b> <b>restraints</b> can lead to severe harm and even death there are no federal guidelines on the proper use <b>of</b> <b>restraints</b> in school systems. However, there are organizations, such as the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC), that propose guidelines that agencies can follow.

50|$|In 2014, the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) {{under the}} U.S. Department of Justice {{released}} a report entitled “Best Practices in the Use <b>of</b> <b>Restraints</b> with Pregnant Women and Girls under Correctional Custody.” This statement on best practices {{was created by the}} National Task Force on the Use <b>of</b> <b>Restraints</b> with Pregnant Women under Correctional Custody to guide and assist institutions and jurisdictions in “the development of local policy and practice.” The report itself outlines five key principles the Task Force reached consensus on and eleven recommendations concerning the use <b>of</b> <b>restraints</b> on pregnant women. In particular, the five principles discuss the following: the importance of written policies and procedures on the use <b>of</b> <b>restraints</b> during custody and transport, who should be writing these policies, the unique healthcare needs and circumstance of pregnant women and girls and the related health risks posed by restraints, and the limitation on the use <b>of</b> <b>restraints</b> to “absolute necessity.” Meanwhile, the eleven recommendations outline specific cases where the use <b>of</b> <b>restraints</b> should be prohibited, avoided and/or limited, as well as what facility standard operating procedures should include regarding the use <b>of</b> <b>restraints</b> on pregnant women. The ACOG, the professional organization of Obstetrics and Gynecology, standards specifically state, that the use <b>of</b> <b>restraints</b> on pregnant incarcerated women and adolescents compromises health care and inhumane. Georgia, South Carolina, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming and Alabama have no policies. Many other states have policies about providing healthcare for pregnant inmates, but do not mention anything about restraining or shackling them.|$|R

Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about {{the tone of the}} speech, saying that the speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the speech as one that emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage.|$|E

25|$|Native American—specifically the Creek's—beliefs {{revolved}} around respecting the environment. The Creek {{believed they had}} a unique relationship with the animals they hunted. The Creek had several rules surround how a hunt could occur, particularly prohibiting needless killing of deer. There were specific taboos against taking the skins of unhealthy deer. However, the lucrative deerskin trade prompted hunters to act past the point <b>of</b> <b>restraint</b> they had operated under before. The hunting economy collapsed due to the scarcity of deer as they were over-hunted and lost their lands to white settlers. Due to the decline of deer populations, and the governmental pressure to switch to the colonists’ way of life, animal husbandry replaced deer hunting both as an income and in the diet.|$|E

Specialists decided that attempts to represent contemporary life through the structure and artistry of the ancient epics could not be considered genuine folklore. Stalin's name has been omitted from the few surviving pseudo-folktales {{of the period}}. Instead of considering folklore under Stalin a renaissance of the traditional Russian epic, today it is generally regarded as a period <b>of</b> <b>restraint</b> and falsehood.|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this article are (1) to identify resident and facility risk factors for the use <b>of</b> physical <b>restraints</b> since the implementation of the Nursing Home Reform Act (NHRA), and (2) to compare these results with resident and facility risk factors for the use <b>of</b> physical <b>restraints</b> prior to the implementation of the NHRA. Data were collected in 1990 and 1993, and represent residents drawn from 268 facilities in 10 states. In the 1993 cohort activities of daily living (ADL) scores, cognitive performance scale (CPS) scores, age, taking antipsychotic medications, a history of falls, and mobility problems were resident-level variables significantly associated with the use <b>of</b> <b>restraints.</b> Full-time-equivalent (FTE) nurse aides per resident, FTE RNs per resident, average occupancy, Herfindahl index, Alzheimer's special care unit, and Medicaid reimbursement policy were facility-level variables significantly associated with the use <b>of</b> <b>restraints.</b> When the 1990 cohort was compared to the 1993 cohort (pre- and post-NHRA), however, only three risk factors for the use <b>of</b> <b>restraints</b> were significant.

The popularity of Parākramabāhu is attested {{by the fact that}} no less than seven monarchs adopted his name over the next four centuries, of whom only two or three could lay claim to even a fraction of his successes.

25|$|John Conolly took up {{residence}} as the third superintendent on 1 June 1839. In April 1839, Serjeant-at-law John Adams, one of the Visiting Justices of the asylum and a founding member and first chairman of Legal & General, suggested that Conolly visit the Lincoln Asylum and see the system operated by Robert Gardiner Hill. He was so impressed by this {{that he decided to}} abolish mechanical restraints at Hanwell. This must have taken enormous powers of persuasion: the existing staff would have to change their work practices and learn how to nurse more effectively those patients with troubling behaviour. However, the reform seemed to avoid the patient suffering further trauma as a result <b>of</b> <b>restraint</b> and being made to feel completely helpless. Conolly succeeded in introducing the reform by 21 September 1839, less than 3 months after he took charge. This is perhaps a testament to the earlier work of Ellis.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a general}} {{similarity}} running through the carved design of most races of primitive culture, the chip form of ornament being almost universally employed. Decorated surfaces depending almost entirely upon the incised line also obtain all over the world, and may no doubt {{be accounted for by}} the extensive use of stone cutting tools. The carver shows the same tendency to over-exalt his art by crowding on too much design as the more civilized craftsman of other lands, while he also on occasion exercises a good deal <b>of</b> <b>restraint</b> by a harmonious balance of decoration and plain space. So far as his chip designs and those patterns more or less depending on the line are concerned, his work as a rule is good and suitable, but when he takes to figure work his attempts do not usually meet with success. Primitive carving, generally, shows that very similar stages of artistic development are passed through by men of every age and race.|$|E

The {{attempt was made}} to compare the <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade doctrine that was developed in England and is still used in the common law countries, on one the hand, and the German <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade rules on the other. Therefore the development <b>of</b> the <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade doctrine in England is described, as well as the modifications <b>of</b> the <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade doctrine in South Africa. Also it is given an overview <b>of</b> the German <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade rules. As far as the English and South African law is concerned, the historical developments and applicable principles <b>of</b> the <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade doctrine are emphasised, whereas the main aim in the German part is to give an overview about the codified <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade rules. While comparing the common law doctrine and the German <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade law it is emphasised that in the common law countries the reasonableness and public interest plays an important role, whereas in German <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade law, on the other hand, the payment of compensation is an important matter.
