As hypothesized, a survey conducted among 170 medical residents of a Dutch university hospital showed that a learning-approach goal orientation had a positive relationship with the seeking of self-improvement information and a negative relationship with the seeking of self-validation information. In contrast, a performance-approach goal <b>orientation</b> <b>was</b> negatively related to the seeking of self-improvement information, while a performance-avoidance goal <b>orientation</b> <b>was</b> positively related to the seeking of self-validation information. Unexpectedly, a performance-avoidance goal <b>orientation</b> <b>was</b> also found to be positively related to the seeking of self-improvement information...|$|R
5|$|Similarly to all inner {{satellites}} of Jupiter, Thebe rotates synchronously {{with its}} orbital motion, thus keeping one face always {{looking toward the}} planet. Its <b>orientation</b> <b>is</b> such that the long axis always points to Jupiter. At the surface points closest to and furthest from Jupiter, the surface {{is thought to be}} {{near the edge of the}} Roche lobe, where Thebe's gravity is only slightly larger than the centrifugal force. As a result, the escape velocity in these two points is very small, thus allowing dust to escape easily after meteorite impacts, and ejecting it into the Thebe gossamer ring.|$|E

5|$|Seen {{as likely}} to provoke {{controversy}} even before its publication, Sexual Preference received considerable media attention, and reviews that were mainly mixed or negative. Critics questioned Bell et al.′s reliance upon a statistical technique, originally developed {{for use in the}} biological sciences, called path analysis, disputed the representativeness of their sample of homosexuals, pointed out the difficulty and potential unreliability of adult recall of childhood feeling and the vague and general nature of the questions respondents were asked, and disagreed with Bell et al.′s suggestion that sexual <b>orientation</b> <b>is</b> innate. Nevertheless, some reviewers complimented Sexual Preference for its authors' challenge to established views about the causes of homosexuality, and it eventually came to be considered a classic work. It {{is one of the most}} frequently cited retrospective studies relating to sexual orientation, credited by psychologists with disproving psychoanalytic theories about the development of homosexuality. In 2009, the American Psychological Association credited Bell et al. with helping to discredit theories attributing sexual orientation to family dynamics or trauma.|$|E
5|$|State-run junior lyceums {{and area}} {{secondary}} schools are single-sex. Junior lyceums {{are divided into}} two grade stages. The first stage is an introductory stage, and runs {{for the first two}} years of secondary schooling. Students study essentially the same subjects with very limited curriculum options in order to provide a good grounding for future studies. Following the two-year introductory cycle, a three-year specialist stage occurs during which students study a common core curriculum as well as a number of elective subjects. This <b>orientation</b> <b>is</b> similar at area secondary schools, although the introductory period is longer, at three years in duration, and the final specialist period is shorter, at two years. The staff-student ratio is set at 1:11, and the school leaving age is 16.|$|E

5|$|The Homosexual Matrix {{is a book}} by American {{psychologist}} Clarence Arthur Tripp, {{in which}} the author discusses the biological and sociological implications of homosexuality, and also attempts to explain heterosexuality and bisexuality. The book {{was first published in}} 1975 by McGraw-Hill Book Company, and later republished in a revised edition in 1987. Based on his review of the evidence, Tripp argues that people do not become homosexual due to factors such as hormone levels, fear of the opposite sex, or the influence of dominant and close-binding mothers, that the amount of attention fathers give to their sons has no effect on the development of homosexuality, that psychoanalytic theories of the development of homosexuality are untenable and based on false assumptions, and that sexual <b>orientation</b> <b>is</b> not innate and depends on learning. Tripp considers early puberty and early masturbation important factors in the development of male homosexuality, and maintains that a majority of people are heterosexual because their socialization has made them want to be heterosexual. He also argues in favor of social tolerance of homosexuality and non-conformist behavior in general.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} {{of sexual activity}} between women as necessary to define a lesbian or a relationship continues to be debated. According to feminist writer Naomi McCormick, women's sexuality is constructed by men, whose primary indicator of lesbian sexual <b>orientation</b> <b>is</b> sexual experience with other women. The same indicator {{is not necessary to}} identify a woman as heterosexual, however. McCormick states that emotional, mental, and ideological connections between women are as important or more so than the genital. Nonetheless, in the 1980s, a significant movement rejected the desexualization of lesbianism by cultural feminists, causing a heated controversy called the feminist sex wars. Butch and femme roles returned, although not as strictly followed {{as they were in the}} 1950s. They became a mode of chosen sexual self-expression for some women in the 1990s. Once again, women felt safer claiming to be more sexually adventurous, and sexual flexibility became more accepted.|$|E
