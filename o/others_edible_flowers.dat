They increase aesthetic appearance of food, but more often they are mentioned in connection with biologically active substances. The main ingredient of the flowers is water, which accounts for more than 80 %. In small amounts, there are also proteins, fat, carbohydrates, fiber and minerals. Bioactive substances such as carotenoids and phenolic compounds determine the functional properties of <b>edible</b> <b>flowers.</b> Aim: The aim of this work was to characterize the phenolic compounds found in <b>edible</b> <b>flowers</b> and compare their antioxidant activity. Results: This review summarizes current knowledge about the usage of <b>edible</b> <b>flowers</b> for human nutrition. The work describes the antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds of some <b>edible</b> <b>flowers.</b> Based on literature data there is a significant difference both in content of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity between <b>edible</b> <b>flowers.</b> These difference reaches up to 3075 -fold in case of antioxidant potential. Among described <b>edible</b> <b>flowers</b> the most distinguishable are roses, peonies, osmanthus fragans and sambuco nero. Conclusions: <b>Edible</b> <b>flowers</b> are the new source of nutraceuticals due to nutritional and antioxidant values.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the level of knowledge about <b>edible</b> <b>flowers</b> and to what extent these are or not consumed. A questionnaire survey was undertaken in the district of Viseu, Portugal, to a sample of 100 possible consumers aged between 20 and 84 years old. The instrument included questions aimed at characterizing the sample together with questions about the knowledge relative to <b>edible</b> <b>flowers,</b> their identification, their consumption, whether there are risks associated with their ingestion, which are those risks and how the consumers face the consumption of <b>edible</b> <b>flowers.</b> The results showed that the participants consider that flowers should be included more frequently in daily foods, both in the fresh form or cooked, given their appreciated organoleptic and decorative characteristics, as well as nutritional and bioactive properties. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|On {{a global}} scale, people are {{demanding}} more attractive and tasty food. Both {{the quality of}} foodstuffs and aesthetic aspects contribute to the appearance of consumed meals. The attraction and appeal of individual dishes could be enhanced by <b>edible</b> <b>flowers.</b> New information concerning the composition and nutritional value of <b>edible</b> <b>flowers</b> is also important and represents a sufficient reason for their consumption. The {{aim of this study}} is to contribute to the popularization of some selected <b>edible</b> <b>flowers</b> of ornamental plants involving altogether 12 species. The flowers were used to determine their antioxidant capacity, which fluctuated between 4. 21 and 6. 96 g of ascorbic acid equivalents (AAE) /kg of fresh mass (FM). Correlation coefficients between antioxidant capacity and the contents of total phenolics and flavonoids were r 2 = 0. 9705 and r 2 = 0. 7861, respectively. Moreover, the results were supplemented with new data about the mineral composition of <b>edible</b> <b>flowers</b> (mostly, not found in the available literature). The highest levels of mineral elements were observed in the flowers of species Chrysanthemum, Dianthus or Viola. The most abundant element was potassium, the content of which ranged from 1, 842. 61 to 3, 964. 84 mg/kg of FM. © 2012 by the authors...|$|R

In addition, phenolic compounds were characterised by HPLC-DAD-MSn. In relation to the nutritional value, the <b>edible</b> <b>flowers</b> had a composition similar to that of other plant foods, with a high water and TDF content, low protein content and very low proportion of total fat—showing significant differences among samples.

40|$|In the past, {{perennial}} and temperate-zone tree-form Hibiscus {{species and}} hybrids have {{been relegated to}} the status of little-known garden plants, at least in the United States. However, their potential as a new source of <b>edible</b> <b>flowers</b> and natural food colorants (all within the anthocyanin class of <b>edible</b> <b>flower</b> pigments) el-evates them to the status as—possibly the newest—of the New Crops. The 17 indigenous native Hibiscus species of North America range from USDA Zones 4 – 10 and, in the wild, are confined to wetland areas. In cultivation, the plants are installed in permanent plantations, using zero-runoff protocols under passive flooding, or drip irrigation protocols. Other hardy perennial and tree-form species from Asia, including H. mutabilis, H. syriacus, and the Pan-Pacific species H. hamabo and H. tileaceous are suitable for USDA Zones 8 – 10. Potential products from these cultivars include fresh food (primarily <b>edible</b> <b>flowers</b> for the restaurant trade) and natural food colorants, as well as edible seed meals and seed proteins (for nutraceutical applications), seed oils, lubricants, and fiber, mucilages and complex polysac-charides from fruiting organs, roots, canes, and/or branches.
