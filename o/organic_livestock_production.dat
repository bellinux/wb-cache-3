The authors conclude that, whilst the available data are limited and the implementation of the EC regulation is relatively recent, there is little evidence to suggest that organic livestock management causes major threats to {{animal health and welfare}} in comparison with conventional systems. There are, however, some well-identified areas, like parasite control and balanced ration formulation, where efforts are needed to find solutions that meet with organic standard requirements and guarantee high levels of health and welfare. It is suggested that, whilst organic standards offer an implicit framework for animal health and welfare management, there is a need to solve apparent conflicts between the organic farming objectives in regard to environment, public health, farmer income and animal health and welfare. The key challenges for the future of <b>organic</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> in Europe are related to the feasibility of implementing improved husbandry inputs and the development of evidence-based decision support systems for health and feeding management.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{objectives}} of organic agriculture {{is to establish a}} largely closed nutrient cycle within the farm system. To limit the input of nutrients in quantity and quality is relevant both to plant and livestock production. If nutrient input is unavoidable to ensure an adequate supply for the farm animals, this should preferably originate from organic systems, while the input of conventional feed stuffs should be restricted to a minimum, and synthetic products are banned. Dealing with limited availability of feed and nutrient resources is therefore a main feature of <b>organic</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>production.</b> The organic approach stands in contrast to the situation in conventional livestock production where the use of feeds and nutrients is restricted primarily by the purchase price. While conventional production has to face various local, regional and global problems caused by excess import and use of concentrated feeds, problems of <b>organic</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> are primarily related to a lack of nutrients at the farm or herd level. Due to these system-related conditions, there is concern about been able to formulate adequate rations for the nutritional-physiological needs of livestock, especially in relation to essential amino acids in the feeding of poultry and pigs. Nutritional imbalances encountered in practice might lead to deteriorating animal health and welfare. On the other hand, there is also concern that allowing conventional feedstuffs to be fed in <b>organic</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>production.</b> This could result in intensification of production, causing the same problems in organic as in intensive livestock production, such as animal health problems, risk of residues and GM contamination. Thus, extending the derogation for conventional feed in the EU regulation may have a damaging effect on consumer confidence in organic animal products.

40|$|Based on <b>production</b> guidelines, <b>organic</b> <b>livestock</b> farming has set {{itself the}} goal to {{establish}} an environmentally friendly production, to sustain animals in good health, to realise high animal welfare standards, and to produce products of high quality. By striving for these goals, <b>organic</b> <b>livestock</b> farming meets the demands of {{an increasing number of}} consumers, which are critical towards the conventional production methods. The paper gives an overview of the present state of the art in the different issues. Possibilities and limitations to perform the self-aimed goals under the basic standards of organic farming are discussed. Concerning environmental protection, the basic standards of organic farming are suited to reduce environmental pollution and nutrient losses on the farm level markedly. With reference to the health situation of dairy cows in both organic and conventional dairy farms, comparative studies show that currently there seem to be no fundamental differences between the production methods. In relation to animal welfare, <b>organic</b> <b>livestock</b> farming, based on minimal standards that go beyond the legislation standards, provide several preconditions for good living conditions of farm animals. Concerning product quality, there is little evidence for a system-related effect on product quality due to the production method. It is concluded that the benefits of the basic standards are primarily related to environmentally friendly production and to the animal welfare issue while the issues of animal health and product quality are more influenced by the specific farm management than by the production method. There is evidence to support the assumption that <b>organic</b> <b>livestock</b> farming creates stronger demands on the qualification of the farm management, including the higher risk of failure. As a consequence, quality assurance programs should be established to ensure that the high demands of the consumers are fulfilled. (SUNDRUM, A.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Organic</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> has {{increased}} dramatically {{in recent years in}} Europe {{and other parts of the}} world. The aim of producing livestock under more natural conditions has led to a reversion to primarily outdoor production systems and less intensive housing when indoor, more forage-based diets, and a reduced reliance on external inputs like antiparasiticides. These major changes in livestock production systems may potentially result in re-emergence (or emergence) of parasitic infections. The basic objective of this paper is to give an overview of the available information on parasitic problems in <b>organic</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> with a focus on northern temperate regions. Furthermore, options for control that target these problems and are acceptable within the framework of organic farming will be discussed. The large majority of conventional pigs and poultry are raised in highly intensive production systems which differ dramatically from organic housing systems and especially outdoor runs and pastures. A comparably pronounced difference between conventional and 1 organic systems is not found for ruminants. Thus, organic rearing may be a higher risk factor for pigs and poultry than for ruminants, however this may partly be counteracted by the fact that pigs and poultry never rely on pasture vegetation for feeding, while ruminants do so wit...|$|E
