25|$|On January 28, 2005, the Cubs traded Sosa to the Baltimore Orioles in {{exchange}} for infielder/outfielder Jerry Hairston, Jr., infielder Mike Fontenot, and RHP Dave Crouthers. To facilitate the deal, Sosa and his agent agreed to waive the clause that guaranteed his 2006 salary, and the players' union indicated it would not <b>object</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> agreement. Under the deal, Sosa earned $17,875,000 for the 2005 season, with the Cubs paying $7 million of his salary. By playing for the 2005 Orioles alongside fellow 500-home-run batter Rafael Palmeiro, Sosa and Palmeiro became the first 500 home run club members in history to play together {{on the same team}} after reaching the 500 home run plateau.|$|E

2500|$|Kelly's athleticism {{gave his}} moves a {{distinctive}} broad, muscular quality, {{and this was}} a very deliberate choice on his part, as he explained: [...] "There's a strong link between sports and dancing, and my own dancing springs from my early days as an athlete...I think dancing is a man's game and if he does it well he does it better than a woman." [...] He railed against what he saw as the widespread effeminacy in male dancing which, in his opinion, [...] "tragically" [...] stigmatized the genre, alienating boys from entering the field: [...] "Dancing does attract effeminate young men. I don't <b>object</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> as long as they don't dance effeminately. I just say that if a man dances effeminately he dances badly — just as if a woman comes out on stage and starts to sing bass. Unfortunately, people confuse gracefulness with softness. John Wayne is a graceful man and so are some of the great ball players...but, of course, they don't run the risk of being called sissies." [...] In his view, [...] "one of our problems is that so much dancing is taught by women. You can spot many male dancers who have this tuition by their arm movements — they are soft, limp and feminine." [...] He acknowledged that, in spite of his efforts — in TV programs such as Dancing: A Man's Game (1958) for example — the situation changed little over the years.|$|E
2500|$|... “One {{morning as}} I {{came into the}} dining-tent I noticed that {{everybody}} but the Indians had been served with hot cakes. [...] This did not bother me much, as Indians do not eat such food. [...] At dinner-time that same day, when I sat down to our table, I saw to my surprise that there were pancakes before us. These were the ‘left-overs’ from the morning, and now the cook wanted to feed them to us. [...] Although I was very angry, I made no remark, but quietly left the table and went over where Buffalo Bill and the head officials of the show were eating dinner. Colonel Cody asked, ‘What is it, Standing Bear?’ ‘Colonel Cody,’ I replied, ‘this morning all the other races represented in the show were served with pancakes, but the Indians were not given any. [...] We do not <b>object</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> as we do not care for them; but now the cook has put his old pancakes on our table and expects us to eat what was left over from breakfast, and it isn’t right.’ [...] Buffalo Bill’s eyes snapped, as he arose from the table. ‘Come with me, Standing Bear,’ he exclaimed. [...] We went direct to {{the manager of the}} dining-room, and the Colonel said to him, ‘Look here, sir, you are trying to feed my Indians left-over pancakes from the morning meal. [...] I want you to understand, sir, that I will not stand for such treatment. [...] My Indians are the principal feature of this show, and they are the one people I will not allow to be misused or neglected. [...] Hereafter, see to it that they get just exactly what they want at meal-time. Do you understand me, sir”’ [...] ‘Yes, sir, oh, yes, sir,’ exclaimed the embarrassed manager. [...] After that, we had no more trouble about our meals.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{theory of}} {{isometric}} group actions on real trees (or R-trees) which are metric spaces generalizing the graph-theoretic {{notion of a}} tree (graph theory). [...] The theory was developed largely in the 1990s, where the Rips machine of Eliyahu Rips on the structure theory of stable group actions on R-trees {{played a key role}} (see Bestvina-Feighn). This structure theory assigns to a stable isometric action of a finitely generated group G a certain [...] "normal form" [...] approximation of that action by a stable action of G on a simplicial tree and hence a splitting of G in the sense of Bass–Serre theory. Group actions on real trees arise naturally in several contexts in geometric topology: for example as boundary points of the Teichmüller space (every point in the Thurston boundary of the Teichmüller space is represented by a measured geodesic lamination on the surface; this lamination lifts to the universal cover of the surface and a naturally dual <b>object</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> lift is an R-tree endowed with an isometric action of the fundamental group of the surface), as Gromov-Hausdorff limits of, appropriately rescaled, Kleinian group actions, and so on. The use of R-trees machinery provides substantial shortcuts in modern proofs of Thurston's Hyperbolization Theorem for Haken 3-manifolds. Similarly, R-trees {{play a key role in}} the study of Culler-Vogtmann's Outer space have north-south dynamics on compactified outer space. Journal de l'Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu, vol. 2 (2003), no. 1, pp. 59–72 as well as in other areas of geometric group theory; for example, asymptotic cones of groups often have a tree-like structure and give rise to group actions on real trees. The use of R-trees, together with Bass–Serre theory, is a key tool in the work of Sela on solving the isomorphism problem for (torsion-free) word-hyperbolic groups, Sela's version of the JSJ-decomposition theory and the work of Sela on the Tarski Conjecture for free groups and the theory of limit groups.|$|E
