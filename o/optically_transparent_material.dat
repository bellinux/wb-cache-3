This copolymer gel is a covalently cross-linked network of N-isopropylacrylamide, sodium acrylate, and a chromophore, which is found to undergo phase transitions exhibiting large hysteresis {{in the degree of}} swelling in response to pH, temperature, and light. In each system, between the transitions for swelling and shrinking, the gel can show either a swollen or a collapsed state, which can be selected according to the history of the variables.

Different methods exist for integrating optics into a microfluidic chip – glass optical fibers can be embedded into polymer chips or polymeric waveguides may be patterned in parallel with the microfluidic chip[2]. These solutions require multi-step processes, different polymers and a lot of time to fabricate. In this paper we present a low cost, disposable, easily to fabricate optical waveguide directly integrated into a polymer microfluidic chip. Poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) has been used to fabricate the waveguide and its design consists of a micro-fluidic channel with a cross-section as illustrated in Fig 1 a. A thin layer of polymer forms th...|$|R
40|$|Selected <b>optically</b> <b>transparent</b> <b>materials</b> and {{coatings}} flown on {{a number}} of low Earth orbit (LEO) materials flight experiments will be reviewed and discussed. Effects of flight exposure for both magnesium fluoride and lithium fluoride specimens will be presented. Individual specimens of magnesium fluoride were flown on the EOIM I 11 Space Shuttle experiment, the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), the Optical Properties Monitor and Passive Optical Sample Assembly experiments on Mir, and MISSE- 1 and MISSE- 2 International Space Station packages. Subsequent to the LDEF retrieval and EOIM I 11 experiment in 1992, the question of atomic oxygen reaction with magnesium fluoride was raised. Atomic oxygen and solar exposures, molecular contamination levels, and varying exposure durations will each be considered in evaluating any observed changes in optical properties. A comparison of the thermodynamics of oxidation of magnesium fluoride and lithium fluoride will be summarized. Elemental composition as a function of depth, as determined using XPS, will be discussed for selected specimens, to gain insight into reactions that are thermodynamically allowed under the LEO conditions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this {{experimental}} study we investigate {{the role of}} atmospheric CO 2 on the optical properties of organic photochemical aerosols. To this end, we add CO 2 to a N 2 :CH 4 gas mixture used in a plasma typically used for Titan studies. We produce organic thin films (tholins) in plasmas where the CO 2 /CH 4 ratio is increased from 0 to 4. We measure these films via spectrometric ellipsometry and apply a Tauc–Lorentz model, used for <b>optically</b> <b>transparent</b> <b>materials,</b> to obtain {{the thickness of the}} thin film, its optical band gap, and the refractive indices in the UV–visible (270 – 600 nm). All samples present a significant absorption band in the UV. According to the Tauc–Lorentz model, as the CO 2 / CH 4 ratio is quadrupled, the position of the UV band is shifted from ~ 177 nm to 264 nm while its strength is quadrupled. Consequently, we infer that oxidized organic aerosols absorb more efficiently at longer UV wavelengths than reduced aerosols. Our laboratory wavelength-tabulated UV–vis refractive indices provide new constraints to atmospheric models of the early Earth and Earth-like exoplanets including photochemical hazes formed under increasingly oxidizing conditions...|$|R
