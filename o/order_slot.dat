40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a new {{strategy}} for the assignment of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) to storage locations in a warehouse, called <b>Order</b> Oriented <b>Slotting</b> (OOS). Given an empty warehouse, a set of orders to be picked and a routing policy, OOS stores the SKUs {{in such a way}} that the total time needed to pick all the orders is minimised. Unlike the Cube per <b>Order</b> Index (COI) <b>slotting</b> strategy which stores an item based on how frequently it is picked without regard to picking sequences, OOS aims to store items, that appear together in orders, close to each other. OOS can be formulated as an Integer Linear Programming model when the routing is S-shaped and when a Vertical Lift Module (VLM) is adopted. Given the computational complexity of the problem, we present several heuristics. Their performance is compared through a set of VLM test problems with different order characteristics.

30|$|Recently, some DSS {{works are}} {{proposed}} {{in the context of}} WBANs. In [24, 25], the authors use a two-state (“good” or “bad”) Gilbert model [26] to describe the variation of on-body channels. Based on the Markov channel model, a DSS scheme, named flipping, is proposed to maximize the expected number of successful transmissions in a TDMA round. The flipping scheme schedules all bad links of the previous superframe last and preserves the order in time in which they were observed while schedules all good links first but reversing the order in which they were observed in the previous superframe. The rationale behind flipping method is that all bad links are given the longest time to recover (i.e., getting out of the outage), while the flipped ordering of the good links takes advantage of the most recently observed good links to ensure a high probability of success in the next transmissions round. Some other research works are also based on the assumption of two-state Markov channel model. To tackle the dynamic fluctuation of on-body channels, the work in [27] presents a novel transition matrix estimation method. In [28], the authors focus on adapting the <b>slot</b> <b>order</b> to improve the effectiveness of retransmission. The node with the worst channel condition is scheduled to occupy the first time slot to get the highest chance of discovering a relaying node, and the best channel is scheduled at the last. In [29 – 31], the authors propose a flipping-like scheduling approach which also adopts Gilbert model to describe the on-body channel. Besides, the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, including energy efficiency, data rate, and packet reception rate, are taken into account to optimize not only the <b>slot</b> <b>order</b> but also <b>slot</b> number.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Maximum-likelihood {{estimation}} of the parameters of a continuous-time model for irregularly sampled data is very sensitive to initial conditions. Simulations may converge to a good solution if the true parameters are used as starting values for the nonlinear search of the minimum of the negative log likelihood. From realizable starting values, the convergence to a continuous-time model with an accurate spectrum is rare if more than three parameters have to be estimated. A discrete-time spectral esti-mator that applies a new algorithm for automatic equidistant missing-data analysis to irregularly spaced data is introduced. This requires equidistant resampling of the data. A slotted near-est neighbor (NN) resampling method replaces a true irregular observation time instant by the nearest equidistant resampling time point {{if and only if}} the distance to the true time is within half the slot width. It will be shown that this new resampling algorithm with the slotting principle has favorable properties over existing schemes such as NN resampling. A further improvement is obtained by using a slot width that is {{only a fraction of the}} resampling time.

Our {{focus is on}} low-cost large-scale deployments where nodes need to be battery-powered with predictable network lifetimes and applications require bounded end-to-end delay. An effective approach to such energy-constrained networks is to operate at low duty cycles and maximize the shutdown interval between packet exchanges. The pri-mary challenge is in coordinating transmissions so they are collision-free while minimizing the duration the nodes are active. RT-Link is a time-synchronized link protocol for fixed and mobile embedded radios. We identify three key observa-tions {{in the design and}} deployment of RT-Link: (a) RT-Link offers predictable network lifetime with bounded end-to-end delay. (b) Achieving global time synchronization is both eco-nomical and convenient for indoor and outdoor deployments.

40|$|THESIS 10533 Wavelength tunable {{single-mode}} semiconductor lasers play {{an essential}} role in modern optical communication systems. They are also rapidly replacing fixed-wavelength light sources in dense wavelength-division-multiplexing (DWDM) systems, which will significantly reduce the system size and cost. The optical communication industry demands light sources with relatively small volume, low inventory cost and high manufacturing yield process. Therefore, laser diodes along with high power, stable operation and narrow linewidth should have simple fabrication process and high yield. Up to now conventional distributed feedback (DFB) and distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) lasers achieved great success in terms of stable operation, high power and wide tuning range. However, these lasers require complex fabrication steps and high resolution processing by using e-beam lithography which is time consuming and an expensive process. Previously it was demonstrated that single-mode operation can be achieved in Fabry-Perot lasers by introducing reflective defects (slots) at particular locations along the cavity. But in these lasers it is extremely hard to integrate them with other photonic components in one chip due to cleavage of both facets. This work presents cost effective and integrable a new single-mode laser design. These lasers based on etched high <b>order</b> gratings (<b>slots)</b> {{on one side of the}} laser cavity to provide enough reflection for lasing to occur. Therefore, no regrowth is needed.

40|$|Abstract. When a {{compiler}} translates a procedure, it must {{lay out the}} procedure’s stack {{frame in}} a way that respects the calling convention. Many compilers respect the convention either by restricting the <b>order</b> in which <b>slots</b> can be allocated or by using different abstractions ad hoc for allocating in different regions of a frame. Such techniques cause the implementation of the layout to be spread over much of the compiler, making it difficult to maintain and verify. We have concentrated the implementation of layout into a single, unifying abstraction: the block. The block abstraction decouples layout from slot allocation. Stack-frame layout is specified in one central place, and even complex layouts are achieved by composing blocks using only two simple operators. Our implementation is used in the Quick C [...] compiler to support multiple calling conventions on multiple architectures. ...|$|R
