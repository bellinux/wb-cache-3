5|$|Feeling {{the need}} to seek out truth creates a {{separation}} between {{the mind of a}} poet and the mind of a philosopher. The poem reconciles the two by allowing the pursuer <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> reflect on his time of simply enjoying nature and God's presence. However, the philosopher aspect is dominant and the individual must {{go out and try to}} help humanity. Nature can be soothing, but the narrator must reject the Edenic quality of nature because such a state is not yet appropriate. The Edenic imagery figures into many of Coleridge's poems and is reinforced with the image of myrtle trees and takes on many forms within his poetry. In Reflections, to dwell in an Edenic state is a paradise in which the narrator leaves voluntarily because he cannot ignore the problems of the world like a coward. Instead, the individual is compelled to join with humanity and even the lowest form of benefiting humanity is superior to doing nothing at all.|$|E

With the aid of Thanos, Warlock alters his future and destroys the Magus's timeline, erasing him from existence.|$|E
25|$|Their {{fundamentally}} different beliefs {{in regards to}} science led the Alterans to hide their level of scientific belief {{so that they would}} not get into a conflict. Eventually, the Ancients decided to build a space ship and leave rather than to use their technology, like the Ark <b>of</b> <b>Truth,</b> <b>to</b> defeat the Ori. Though they had the ability to stop the Ori, they thought it to be philosophically and morally wrong. The film thus addresses the non-interference policy of the Ancients under the Ori threat, and how they act millions of years later, when SG-1 succeeds in killing the Ori.|$|E

25|$|The {{underpinnings}} for {{the contemporary}} moral panic {{were found in}} a rise of five factors in the {{years leading up to}} the 1980s: the establishment of fundamentalist Christianity and political organization of the Moral Majority; the rise of the Anti-cult movement which spread ideas of abusive cults kidnapping and brainwashing children and teens; the appearance of the Church of Satan and other explicitly Satanist groups that added a kernel <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> the existence of Satanic cults; the development of the social work or child protection field, and its struggle to have child sexual abuse recognized as a social problem and a serious crime; and the popularization of posttraumatic stress disorder, repressed memory, and corresponding survivor movement.|$|E
25|$|There is {{an element}} <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> Dayan's claim, but it is {{important}} to note that Israel regarded the de-militarized zones in the north as part of their sovereign territory and reserved the right to cultivate them—a right that the Syrians consistently resisted with force. Syria also worked to benefit from the Jordan river before it flowed into Israel, aiming to get use of it as a water source; Syria also actively supported Palestinian resistance movements against Israel. Israel occasionally exploited incidents in the de-militarized zones to strike at the Syrian water diversion project and to punish the Syrians for their support of the Palestinian resistance. Dayan's remarks must also be taken in context of the fact that he was a member of the opposition at the time. His attitude toward the Syrians changed dramatically once he became defense minister. Indeed, on June 8, 1967, Dayan bypassed both the Prime Minister and the Chief of staff in ordering the Israeli army to attack and capture the Golan.|$|E
25|$|Oba captures Kahlan and {{is ordered}} by the Keeper to take her, along with the Sword <b>of</b> <b>Truth,</b> <b>to</b> the Pillars of Creation. Using his link to the sword, Richard pursues Oba to the Pillars, where he {{encounters}} Jennsen, who has also been drawn to the same spot by the Keeper in order to kill Richard. The Keeper's supreme plan, however, was for Richard to kill Jennsen at the Pillars of Creation and thereby open a gate between the Keeper's realm {{and the world of}} the living. Richard discerns the plan and refuses to be goaded into cooperating. Jennsen recognizes his integrity and the Keeper's plan is foiled. She learns that the men who were sent to kill her mother were actually soldiers of the Imperial Order, and after coming to believe that Richard is truly a loving and caring brother, she joins him and Kahlan in their quest against Jagang.|$|E

25|$|The old fleurs-de-lis, {{especially}} the ones {{found in our}} first kings' sceptres, have a lot less in common with ordinary lilies than the flowers called flambas , or irises, from which the name of our own fleur-de-lis may derive. What gives some colour <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> this hypothesis that we already put forth, {{is the fact that}} the French or Franks, before entering Gaul itself, lived for a long time around the river named Leie in the Flanders. Nowadays, this river is still bordered with an exceptional number of irises —as many plants grow for centuries in the same places—: these irises have yellow flowers, which is not a typical feature of lilies but fleurs-de-lis. It was thus understandable that our kings, having to choose a symbolic image for what later became a coat of arms, set their minds on the iris, a flower that was common around their homes, and is also as beautiful as it was remarkable. They called it, in short, the fleur-de-lis, instead of the flower of the river of lis. This flower, or iris, looks like our fleur-de-lis not just because of its yellow colour but also because of its shape: of the six petals, or leaves, that it has, three of them are alternatively straight and meet at their tops. The other three on the opposite, bend down so that the middle one seems to make one with the stalk and only the two ones facing out from left and right can clearly be seen, which is again similar with our fleurs-de-lis, that is to say exclusively the one from the river Luts whose white petals bend down too when the flower blooms.|$|E

500|$|In {{taking over}} the role, Cortese felt [...] "conflicted over where Ruby is now versus where she's come from" [...] and {{explained}} that her own portrayal of the character was a [...] "total 180 from [...] last season", being calmer and [...] "more fear-driven"; after a discussion with Kripke on the character's mindset, Cortese saw Ruby as being in a [...] "lonely, desperate" [...] situation. She tried to make Ruby seem [...] "as innocent as possible" [...] to make viewers question her true allegiance, and to [...] "bring more of a humanity" [...] to Ruby than Cassidy had. For example, taking from the third season finale in which Dean is sent to Hell, Cortese portrayed the character as having some guilt over his death, even though Ruby was not responsible for it. The actress also acknowledged that Ruby was likely manipulating Sam when she claimed to remember {{how it felt to}} be human, but suggested that there was also an element <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> her character's words.|$|E

500|$|According to Tripp, sexual {{attraction}} is encouraged by [...] "tension and distance" [...] between {{one person and}} another, and is consequently [...] "seldom aroused and never rewarding unless something in the partner or in the situation itself is viewed as resistant to it." [...] Tripp maintains that societies have increased divisions {{between men and women}} partly to satisfy needs inherent in sexual psychology. He suggests that there are often elements <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> traditional accusations made against women, such as deviousness, and that derogatory descriptions of women serve to increase divisions between the sexes, create tension between them, and make relations between men and women more exciting. Tripp proposes that social bonds between men are not prone to becoming sexual because the similarity and camaraderie between men make them too close to each other for homosexual activities to have any interest. Tripp maintains that heterosexuality and homosexuality generally develop in parallel ways, but that since homosexuality, unlike heterosexuality, is not encouraged and institutionalized by society, its origins are more [...] "scattered and diverse." [...] He reviewed anthropological evidence on homosexuality.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} the album brought wealth to all {{four members of the}} band; Richard Wright and Roger Waters bought large country houses, and Nick Mason became a {{collector}} of upmarket cars.

[...] Although Waters and Gilmour have on occasion downplayed his contribution to the {{success of the}} album, Mason has praised his role. [...] In 2003, Parsons reflected: [...] "I think they all felt that I managed to hang the rest of my career on Dark Side of the Moon, which has an element <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> it. [...] But I still wake up occasionally, frustrated about the fact that they made untold millions and a lot of the people involved in the record didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|Over the {{two decades}} {{that it had been}} published, Hellblazer had {{normally}} been quite well received. While not attaining the sales of 'mainstream' comics, it had sustained healthy figures, consistently being one of the top selling Vertigo titles, and was sustained by healthy sales of trade paperbacks. Hillary Goldstein of IGN described it as, [...] "Sometimes surreal, often provocative and almost always entertaining, the adventures of the Hellblazer are among the best Vertigo has to offer." [...] Well-known comic book writer Warren Ellis also praised the series as his favorite, calling it as [...] "among the very best horror works of the 1990's." [...] Andre Borges from DNA India listed it in the [...] "15 Must Read Graphic Novels", describing it as [...] "one of the first of its kind", and that its [...] "writing and art work have been praised throughout its run."

2500|$|Numerous criticisms {{have been}} leveled at Constructivist epistemology. The most common {{one is that}} it either {{explicitly}} advocates or implicitly reduces to relativism. This is because it takes the concept <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> be a socially [...] "constructed" [...] (and thereby socially relative) one. This leads {{to the charge of}} self-refutation: if what is to be regarded as [...] "true" [...] is relative to a particular social formation, then this very conception of truth must itself be only regarded as being [...] "true" [...] in this society. In another social formation, it may well be false. If so, then social constructivism itself would be false in that social formation. Further, one could then say that social constructivism could be both true and false simultaneously.|$|E

Techne can be understood neither as art or craft, the reason being that the distinctions of art and craft are historical products that came later on in human history. Techne included painting, sculpting and music but also; cooking, medicine, horsemanship, geometry, carpentry, prophecy, and farming etc.|$|E
