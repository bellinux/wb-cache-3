5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms including changes in sensation (hypoesthesia), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, impaired movement, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems in speech (known as dysarthria) or swallowing (dysphagia), visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis, or diplopia), fatigue and acute or chronic pain syndromes, bladder and bowel difficulties, cognitive impairment, or emotional symptoms (mainly depression). At the same time for each symptom there are different treatment options. Treatments should therefore be individualized depending both <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> and the physician.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a variety}} of psychotherapeutic {{approaches}} employed by psychologists and psychiatrists; the one used depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> and the patient's symptoms.

25|$|Acoustic stethoscopes are {{familiar}} to most people, and operate on the transmission of sound from the chest piece, via air-filled hollow tubes, to the listener's ears. The chestpiece usually consists of two sides that can be placed against the patient for sensing sound; a diaphragm (plastic disc) or bell (hollow cup). If the diaphragm is placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient,</b> body sounds vibrate the diaphragm, creating acoustic pressure waves which travel up the tubing to the listener's ears. If the bell is placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient,</b> the vibrations of the skin directly produce acoustic pressure waves traveling up to the listener's ears. The bell transmits low frequency sounds, while the diaphragm transmits higher frequency sounds. This two-sided stethoscope was invented by Rappaport and Sprague {{in the early part}} of the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|Differences {{in rates}} of {{withdrawal}} (50–100%) vary depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> sample. For example, {{a random sample}} of long-term benzodiazepine users typically finds around 50% experience few or no withdrawal symptoms, with the other 50% experiencing notable withdrawal symptoms. Certain select patient groups show a higher rate of notable withdrawal symptoms, up to 100%.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{arachnoid}} cysts {{may never}} show symptoms, even {{in some cases}} where the cyst is large. Therefore, while the presence of symptoms may provoke further clinical investigation, symptoms independent of further data cannot—and should not—be interpreted as evidence of a cyst's existence, size, location, or potential functional impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient.</b>|$|E

25|$|A hybrid {{operating}} {{room is a}} surgical theatre that is equipped with advanced medical imaging devices such as fixed C-Arms, CT scanners or MRI scanners.

Minimally-invasive surgery {{is intended to be}} less traumatic for the patient and minimize incisions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> and perform surgery procedure through one or several small cuts.|$|E
25|$|Many {{other items}} are variably kept within the medical record. Digital {{images of the}} patient, {{flowsheets}} from operations/intensive care units, informed consent forms, EKG tracings, outputs from medical devices (such as pacemakers), chemotherapy protocols, and numerous other important pieces of information form part of the record depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> {{and his or her}} set of illnesses/treatments.|$|E
25|$|Ionising radiation, used in {{a variety}} of imaging procedures, can damage cells. Lead shields are used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> and by the Radiographer to reduce {{exposure}} by shielding areas that {{do not need to be}} imaged from the radiation source. While lead is highly toxic, the shields used in medical imaging are coated to prevent lead exposure and are regularly tested for integrity.|$|E

The final LOC sub-section is based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient's</b> ability to follow verbal commands to perform simple task. Although this item is broken into three parts, each sub-section is added to the final score as if it is its own item.|$|R
25|$|Another meta-study {{examined}} the proposed neurological mechanisms behind music therapy's effects on these patients. Many authors suspect that music has a soothing effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> by affecting how noise is perceived: music renders noise familiar, or buffers the patient from overwhelming or extraneous noise in their environment. Others suggest that music {{serves as a}} sort of mediator for social interactions, providing a vessel through which to interact with others without requiring much cognitive load.|$|E
25|$|Depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient,</b> the cancer, {{the stage}} of cancer, the type of chemotherapy, and the dosage, {{intravenous}} chemotherapy may be given on either an inpatient or an outpatient basis. For continuous, frequent or prolonged intravenous chemotherapy administration, various systems may be surgically inserted into the vasculature to maintain access. Commonly used systems are the Hickman line, the Port-a-Cath, and the PICC line. These have a lower infection risk, are much less prone to phlebitis or extravasation, and {{eliminate the need for}} repeated insertion of peripheral cannulae.|$|E

Lieberman announced in January 2011 that he would retire from the Senate at the end of his term, and he did so in January 2013.|$|E

25|$|Hyponatremia is {{the most}} {{commonly}} seen water–electrolyte imbalance. The disorder is more frequent in females, the elderly, and in people who are hospitalized. The incidence of hyponatremia depends largely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> population. A hospital incidence of 15–20% is common, while only 3–5% {{of people who are}} hospitalized have a serum sodium level (salt blood level) of less than 130mmol/L. Hyponatremia has been reported in up to 30% of elderly patients in nursing homes and is also present in approximately 30% of depressed patients on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|Positron-emission {{tomography}} (PET) is {{a nuclear}} medicine functional imaging technique {{that is used}} to observe metabolic processes in the body. The system detects pairs of gamma rays emitted indirectly by a positron-emitting radionuclide (tracer), which is introduced into the body on a biologically active molecule. Three-dimensional images of tracer concentration within the body are then constructed by computer analysis. In modern PET-CT scanners, three-dimensional imaging is often accomplished {{with the aid of a}} CT X-ray scan performed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> during the same session, in the same machine.|$|E
25|$|Sacks {{described}} his cases with {{a wealth of}} narrative detail, concentrating on {{the experiences of the}} patient (in the case of his A Leg to Stand <b>On,</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> was himself). The patients he described were often able to adapt to their situation in different ways despite the fact that their neurological conditions were usually considered incurable. His book Awakenings, upon which the 1990 feature film of the same name is based, describes his experiences using the new drug levodopa on Beth Abraham Hospital post-encephalitic patients. Awakenings was also the subject of the first documentary made (in 1974) for the British television series Discovery.|$|E
