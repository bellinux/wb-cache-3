5|$|Barbirolli's first {{concert in}} New York was on 5 November 1936. The {{programme}} consisted of short pieces by Berlioz and Arnold Bax, and symphonies by Mozart (the Linz) and Brahms (the Fourth). During his ten weeks, he programmed several American novelties including Charles Martin Loeffler's tone-poem Memories <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Childhood,</b> a symphony by Anis Fuleihan, and Philip James's Bret Harte overture. He also conducted Serge Koussevitzky's Double Bass Concerto. The players told the Philharmonic management {{that they would}} be happy for Barbirolli to be appointed to a permanent position. The outcome of this was an invitation to him to become Music Director and Permanent Conductor for three years starting with the 1937–38 season. At the same time as this great change in his professional life, Barbirolli's personal life was also transformed. His marriage had not lasted; within four years he and Marjorie Barbirolli had been living apart. In 1938 she sued for divorce on the grounds of his desertion. The suit was undefended, and the divorce was granted in December 1938. In 1939, Barbirolli married the British oboist Evelyn Rothwell. The marriage lasted for the rest of Barbirolli's life.|$|E

25|$|To these Three Kings I mainly owe {{the happy}} Christmas seasons <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>childhood</b> and I should have {{remained}} {{very grateful to}} them. Instead, I came to America and soon forgot all about them, for here at Christmas time one sees so many Santa Clauses scattered all over town. Then there is the big Christmas tree in Rockefeller Plaza, the elaborate toy windows on Fifth Avenue, the one-hundred-voice choir in Grand Central Station, the innumerable Christmas carols on radio and television—and all these things made me forget the three dear old Kings of my old childhood.|$|E

500|$|A {{few days}} earlier I'd just heard of the tragic death of my colleague... As I meditated on the {{fragility}} of our human frame, I was drawn once more {{to the life of}} the spirit.

The same evening of this visit to Rocamadour, I began my Litanies à la Vierge noire for female voices and organ.

During his world tour in 1881 and upon learning of Harris's death, Kalākaua, who had also received his first instruction in law under Harris, wrote to their sister Liliʻuokalani reminiscing about their elder brother and his work as an interpreter: [...] "I feel it [...] the more when I recall the days <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>childhood</b> and that of our brother James Kaliokalani, who was our first instructor in Law and remained with him as assistant interpreter of the Police Court for two years".|$|E

40|$|My {{thesis is}} really in three fold. Since my work has its origin in the {{recollections}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> earliest <b>childhood</b> memories, I will explain how the pieces in my show {{are a result of}} those early memories.

Finally, I will consider the direction <b>of</b> <b>my</b> future work, and how it can continue to grow and mature...|$|R
500|$|The {{director}} {{was inspired by}} his own experiences: [...] "The germ for that comes from my own childhood memories of school-time friends. I have lived in boarding school for most <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>childhood</b> and the friends that I have today are the ones whom I {{got in touch with}} during 4th/5th standard. I may not speak to them for years but they are a family whom I can call up at 4 am without hesitation." [...] Manuskhani soon realised that Bollywood had explored friendship, live–in relationships, marriage and divorce many times, and he wanted to do something different for his debut film. He decided to use sexuality to shed light on the issue, untouched by Bollywood, for the Indian audience.|$|E
500|$|Other candidates, {{including}} two of Prince Henry's brothers, Prince Alexander ("Sandro") and Prince Louis of Battenberg, were put forward to be Beatrice's husband, {{but they did}} not succeed. [...] Although Alexander never formally pursued Beatrice, merely claiming that he [...] "might even at one time have become engaged to the friend <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>childhood,</b> Beatrice of England", Louis was more interested. Queen Victoria invited him to dinner but sat between him and Beatrice, who had been told by the Queen to ignore Louis to discourage his suit. Louis, not realising for several years the reasons for this silence, married Beatrice's niece, Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine. Although her marriage hopes had been dealt another blow, while attending Louis's wedding at Darmstadt, Beatrice fell in love with Prince Henry, who returned her affections.|$|E

The line, appearing in both French and English is: « Les hivers de mon enfance étaient des saisons longues, longues. Nous vivions en trois lieux : l’école, l’église et la patinoire; mais la vraie vie était sur la patinoire. » / [...] "The winters <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>childhood</b> were long, long seasons.

500|$|Like Amir, {{the protagonist}} of the novel, Hosseini was born in Afghanistan and left {{the country as a}} youth, not {{returning}} until 2003. Thus, he was frequently questioned about the extent of the autobiographical aspects of the book. In response, he said, [...] "When I say some of it is me, then people look unsatisfied. The parallels are pretty obvious, but... I left a few things ambiguous because I wanted to drive the book clubs crazy." [...] Having left the country {{around the time of the}} Soviet invasion, he felt a certain amount of survivor's guilt: [...] "Whenever I read stories about Afghanistan my reaction was always tinged with guilt. A lot <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>childhood</b> friends had a very hard time. Some of our cousins died. One died in a fuel truck trying to escape Afghanistan [...] Talk about guilt. He was one of the kids I grew up with flying kites. His father was shot." [...] Regardless, he maintains that the plot is fictional. Later, when writing his second novel, A Thousand Splendid Suns (then titled Dreaming in Titanic City), Hosseini remarked that he was happy that the main characters were women as it [...] "should put the end to the autobiographical question once and for all".|$|E
