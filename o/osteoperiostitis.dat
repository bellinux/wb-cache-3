40|$|Through the {{analysis}} of human skeletal remains and mortuary practice in Yinxu, this study investigates the impact of early urbanization on the commoners during the Late Shang dynasty (ca. 1250 - 1046 B. C.). A total of 347 individuals {{examined in this study}} represent non-elites who were recovered from two different burial contexts (formally buried in lineage cemeteries and randomly scattered in refuse pits). Frequencies of enamel hypoplasia (childhood stress), cribra orbitalia (childhood stress and frailty) and <b>osteoperiostitis</b> (adult stress) were examined to assess systemic stress exposure. Our results reveal that {{there was no significant difference}} in the frequency of enamel hypoplasia between two burial groups and between sexes, suggesting these urban commoners experienced similar stresses during childhood, but significantly elevated levels of cribra orbitalia and <b>osteoperiostitis</b> were observed in the refuse pit female cohort. Theoretically, urbanization would have resulted in increased population density in the urban centre, declining sanitary conditions, and increased risk of resource shortage. Biologically, children would be more vulnerable to such physiological disturbance; as a result, high percentages of enamel hypoplasia (80. 9 % overall) and cribra orbitalia (30. 3 % overall) are observed in Yin commoners. Adults continued to suffer from stress, resulting in high frequencies of <b>osteoperiostitis</b> (40. 0 % total adults); in particular, in the refuse pit females who may also reflect a compound impact of gender inequality. Our data show that the non-elite urban population in the capital city of Late Shang Dynasty had experienced extensive stress exposure due to early urbanization with further social stratification only worsening the situation, and eventually contributing to collapse of the Shang Dynasty...|$|E
40|$|A large, fossilised crocodilian {{metatarsal}} {{has been}} {{recovered from the}} Pliocene Bluff Downs Local Fauna exhibiting proliferative bone growth consistent with an episode of <b>osteoperiostitis,</b> possibly resulting from trauma. The nature and location of this trauma suggests {{that it may have}} occurred as a result of intraspecific aggression between rival animals. Three crocodilian genera have been recovered from the Fluff Downs Fauna, Crocodylus, Quinkana and Pallimnarchus. The metatarsal does not conform to Crocodylus porosus and therefore most probably represents one of the other two known crocodilian taxa The nature of the injury suggests that it occurred in water and it may belong to the now extinct Plio-Pleistocene Pallimnarchus rather than Quinkana babarra which is interpreted as being predominantly terrestrial...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 2515 people {{attending}} a large military hospital in Saudi Arabia was studied clinically, serologically, and (when appropriate) radiologically {{for evidence of}} treponematosis. The indications are that non-venereal endemic syphilis (bejel) is prevalent among the nomadic communities living in rural areas. In contrast, venereal syphilis is much less common, and is found almost exclusively in urban populations. Some of the high risk regions for bejel have been identified, and many people from these locations complained of persistent pain in the legs, which was often associated with radiological evidence of <b>osteoperiostitis</b> of the long bones. Bejel also seems to have become clinically "attenuated" within the last 30 years, {{with the majority of}} seroreactors having latent disease. A hypothesis suggesting a reason for this change is put forward, and ways of controlling the infection are outlined...|$|E
40|$|Human remains from archaeological {{contexts}} {{provide a}} fund {{of information for}} addressing questions and hypotheses about {{what life was like}} in the past. These remains are especially important because they represent the individual and their life experiences from early childhood through adulthood, and especially those experiences relating to health and lifestyle. This paper presents an overview of health indicators documented in an ongoing bioarchaeological project involving the study of remains of people interred at the church of San Pietro a Pozzeveri, located near the village of Badia Pozzeveri in the province of Tuscany, northern Italy. Founded in the 11 th century A. D., the church was in continuous existence until the mid- 20 th century. The church was part of a monastery during the 12 th through 14 th centuries, and was located on the Via Francigena, a strategic trade and pilgrimage route connecting Canterbury, England, with Rome. Archaeological excavations have produced numerous skeletons from the medieval, Renaissance, and modern (17 th to 19 th centuries) periods. Key events that impacted the people living in this region included the Black Death, which swept through Europe in the medieval period, and the local record of the global cholera epidemic in the mid- 19 th century. Study of skeletal and dental pathology (<b>osteoperiostitis,</b> osteoarthritis, dental caries), trauma, and other evidence of living conditions reveals the hardships of life in this setting. The record of infection and poor oral health speaks to both the poor circumstances of diet, including a focus on dietary carbohydrates, and poor health generally in the region in particular and Europe in general during this thousand-year period of history...|$|E
40|$|Integrating three projects, this {{dissertation}} {{focused on}} the analysis of human skeletal remains to better understand human adaptation and lifeways in Bronze Age North China. During this time, China witnessed dramatic sociocultural changes in the Central Plain caused by urbanization and represented by the large city centre in Anyang, while pre-urbanization lifeways such as nomadic subsistence practice remained unchanged {{in some parts of}} Northeast China. Human skeletal remains, often well-preserved in North China, provide unique opportunities to examine osteological evidence to evaluate human responses to these sociocultural changes. The first project analysed oral health indicators (caries, abscesses, AMTL, and pulp chamber exposure) in three Late Bronze Age (ca. 3000 – 2000 B. P.) skeletal populations (n= 187) from the Central Plain and Northeast China. The results clearly showed that deteriorated oral health was observed in agriculture-based subsistence. The second project assessed impacts of early urbanization on 347 commoners of the Late Shang (ca. 3250 – 3046 B. P.) in Anyang. High frequencies were observed in all the commoners for enamel hypoplasia but significantly different frequencies were found between groups or sexes for cribra orbitalia or <b>osteoperiostitis</b> respectively, indicating overall high levels of stress, likely derived from early urbanization and different stress responses by different groups and sexes. The last project evaluated the prevalence of osteoarthritis in 193 adult remains of the Late Shang in Anyang (ca. 3250 – 3046 B. P.). The observed pattern showed a clear sex difference of osteoarthritis distribution, suggesting a strong gender division of labour. An extremely high frequency (at 92 %) of metatarsal-phalangeal osteoarthritis caused by kneeling (repetitive hyperdorsiflexion of toes) indicated that kneeling was most likely a prescribed cultural component in daily life and activities. This speculation is consistent with the observation that kneeling as a symbol appeared in many oracle bone characters of the time. This dissertation research has provided new regional perspectives for bioarchaeological studies of subsistence practice and social dynamics of the past, and it has also demonstrated when positioned within rich archaeological contexts, human remains can provide unique insight to enhance our ability to study human environment interactions of the past...|$|E
40|$|A case of osseous treponemal {{disease of}} the {{shoulder}} : anatomical and radiological aspects of a fragmentary french skeleton (XVI™-XVIII™ century ad) Summary. — The aetiological diagnosis of osseous infection disease on only some bones is usually restrictive However, we have been particularly astonished at seeing resemblance, at once topographic and macroscopic, of the lesions seen on the bones of a left shoulder (clavicula, scapula and humérus), sole evidence of a slender adult skeleton buried between the XVIth and XVIII" 1 century m the St. Jean Baptiste church of Vmz-Fa verges, in Haute-Savoie (France), and the lesions observed on a complete adult skeleton buried {{during the same period}} (XVIIth c.) in Nyárlónnc (Hungary), and carrier of typical treponemal disease. The volume of the clavicula is uniformly increased by a penostitic hyperostosis, with a smooth porotic surface, eroded in places by a osteolytic process (medial anterior face), and with a corrugated aspect on the inferior face (borderline with the posterior face, uninjured on its medial surface). Radiographs show a mixed texture in the hyperostosis, with a dominant rarefaction on the anterior face, and a lamellar aspect on the posterior apposition The scapula shows mixed lesions of a slight penostotic hyperostosis associated with important osteolytic lesions of the spine (microgeodic holes and destruction of the tuberculum trapezium, thinning of acromial extremity and medial angle); a thin periostotic hyperostosis "coating" the supraspinatus fossa (corrugated aspect), the step of the spine in the infraspinatus fossa, the medial margin and the crest of the subscapular/owa; the posterior edge of the glenoid/ossa is eroded by a lytic lesion, edged on its anterior limit with a mamillated hyperostosis of the articular surface. The proximal metaphysis of the humérus presents several milhmetric perforations of the lateral face, surrounded with fluted thin penostitic hyperostosis, making a limited blister of cortical bone (illustrated by increased opacity on radiographs); the distal metaphysis and epiphysis presents lytic predominant lesions with résorption of the posterolateral face and the lateral epicondyle, and pittered penostitic hyperostosis on medial and lateral supracondylar crests, medial and lateral condyles, without respect of coronoid and olecranon/ошге; the articular surfaces are normal. The association, on cortical and trabecular bone altering, of a macroscopic fluted penostitic hyperostosis, and a radiographie lamellar aspect, with radiotransparent areas, is highly suggestive of treponemal <b>osteoperiostitis</b> (clavicula notably); juxtaposed geods and perforations rounded with dense edging and cortical-periostitic thickening are very suggestive of gummatous osteitis (humérus). We conclude that these three bones were affected by treponemal disease (probably tertiary or late congenital syphilis), and that there exists a topographic uniformity of treponemal lesions on the shoulder, the comparison with the Hungarian and recent palaeopathologic case reports permitting to specify the macroscopic aspects of the injury. Résumé. — II est souvent difficile de faire le diagnostic précis d'atteinte osseuse d'origine infectieuse sur un squelette fragmentaire. Cependant, nous avons été particulièrement étonné de constater la similitude à la fois topographique et macroscopique des lésions observées sur une clavicule, un scapulum et un humérus gauches d'un individu adulte provenant de l'église St Jean- Baptiste de Viuz Faverges près d'Albertville (Haute-Savoie, France), inhumé entre les XVIe et XVIIIe siècles, et les lésions observées sur le squelette de l'épaule d'un adulte de la nécropole hongroise de Nyárlónnc, inhumé au XVIIe siècle et porteur d'une atteinte tréponémateuse caractéristique de syphilis tertiaire acquise, ou congénitale tardive. L'analogie morphologique des lésions de ces deux cas ainsi que les données de la littérature paléopathologique récente, ont permis de conclure à l'unité topographique des lésions syphilitiques de l'épaule osseuse, et de préciser certaines caractéristiques macroscopiques, notamment au niveau du scapulum.

40|$|SummaryPurpose of the studyThe {{present study}} reviews our {{experience}} of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in 450  children {{over a period of}} 20  years from 1985  to 2004  at the Nouméa Territorial Hospital in New Caledonia. The objective was to formulate a new theory of the pathogenesis of this affection and to report our research on the disparity in the pathology between temperate countries and our own tropical Pacific area. Patient and methodsOnly children with an initially normal X-ray and showing symptoms for less than one week were included in the study. Subacute osteomyelitis, infant osteoarthritis and spinal and sacroiliac joint infections were all excluded. All children were treated according to a preestablished protocol including: clinical examination; blood tests; ultrasound, to determine the presence and size of the periosteal elevation and to exclude soft tissue abscess and frequent pyomyositis. Ultrasound was used in the decision to treat with antibiotics alone or with surgery. Computed Tomography was used for deep structures assessment and medical therapy guidance Surgery was limited to open drainage of the subperiosteal abscess only. Regular follow-up of outpatients was continued until normal blood test and X-ray results were achieved. Results and discussionFour hundred and fifty children with a diagnosis of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis were identified, giving an average incidence of 22  new cases per year (range, 12 – 35). This incidence was two to five times as high as found in Europe. Fifty-three percent of our cases required surgical drainage (vs. 20  % in Europe). Ethnically, 60  % of the children were Melanesian and 20  % Polynesian (both represented less than 50  % of the local population). A similar incidence, about four times as high as in the population of European descent, was reported in Polynesians by our neighbors in New Zealand. The limbs were affected in 90  % of cases, and specifically lower limbs in 70  %. Multiple osseous lesions and systemic infection were recorded in 43  children (9. 5  %). Blood cultures and surgical samples were positive in 80  % of cases, and otherwise negative. All the children were successfully treated, without chronic evolution or sequelae needing secondary surgery. The predominant microorganisms isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, in 81  % of cases, none of which were methicillin-resistant, and group A Streptococcus in 7. 5  % of cases. A previous study of soft-tissue S.  aureus infection showed the presence of Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) genes in 89  % of cases. These very infrequent genes are responsible for leukotoxic apoptosis, producing leukocidin, causing local acute aggressiveness. A parallel study, in progress for more than a year, is focusing on detecting PVL genes in S.  aureus isolated from acute osteomyelitis: in the first nine children analyzed, PVL genes were likewise detected in 89  % of the S.  aureus isolated, with no methicillin resistance. Ultrasonography allowed positive diagnosis in 64  % of cases on the day of admission and 84  % by the second day. Because of this very early presence of subperiosteal abscess {{at the beginning of the}} disease, and several other issues raised in the present study, we believe that Trueta's theory of acute osteomyelitis pathogenesis does not provide any logical explanation for our anatomoclinical observations. We believe that the primary focus of infection is in the osteoperiosteal area rather than under the growth plate in the metaphyseal bone. The term of Acute Osteo-Periostitis would therefore be much more suitable. A history of blunt trauma was found in 63  % of cases in the present series, and often reported in the literature. We speculate that two forms of infection fixation may develop: a local form, where bacteria carried by the blood stream reach a subperiosteal edema or hematoma secondary to blunt trauma, which is in our opinion the most frequent cause; and a general form, where fixation occurs as single or multifocal <b>osteoperiostitis,</b> and multivisceral locations in severe forms of septicemia. The disparity in this pathology between temperate countries and our own tropical Pacific area is certainly due to PVL-positive S.  aureus and ethnic factors. The high prevalence of Melanesian and Polynesian patients confirms that they are at high risk of musculoskeletal infection in New Caledonia as in other Pacific countries, and it is possible that these ethnic groups are genetically susceptible to PVL-positive strains.
