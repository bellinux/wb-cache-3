5|$|Researchers are {{investigating}} the clinical significance of c-KIT mutations in AML. These are prevalent, and potentially clinically relevant because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib and sunitinib that can block the activity of c-KIT pharmacologically. It is expected that additional markers (e.g., RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53) that have consistently been associated with an inferior outcome will soon be included in these recommendations. The prognostic importance of other mutated genes (e.g., DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2) is less clear.|$|E
5|$|The {{families}} {{of individuals who}} have inherited or {{are at risk of}} inheriting HD have generations of experience of HD, but may be unaware of recent breakthroughs in understanding the disease, and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> genetic testing. Genetic counseling benefits these individuals by updating their knowledge, seeking to dispel any unfounded beliefs that they may have, and helping them consider their future options and plans. Also covered is information concerning family planning choices, care management, and other considerations.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the 2003 {{municipal}} elections, the Labour Party mayor {{candidates for}} the municipalities of Skedsmo, Rælingen and Lørenskog, Andreas Hamnes, Terje Granerud and Åge Tovan, proposed that a central, inter-municipal athletics venue be built for Nedre Romerike. The proposal was followed up by the three athletics clubs in the area, Minerva IS, Strømmen IF and Lørenskog FIL, who established a committee. Several locations were considered, but the committee landed on Lillestrøm idrettspark because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> existing utilities, parking and changing rooms, which would reduce the investment costs. In the process, Strømmen stadion was rejected because it was undergoing upgrades to receive artificial turf and Marikollen was deemed too remote. Also Nordlimyra in Lørenskog was deemed unsuitable. The choice of Lillestrøm idrettspark was selected by consensus among the municipalities and the sports clubs in June 2005.|$|E

This decision {{is based on}} various issues: <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breast, <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> previous examinations, <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> technology and also <b>the</b> radiologist’s preference {{in relation to the}} specific case.|$|R

25|$|In Arizona, both {{cover and}} height of {{vegetation}} used by soras varied with seasons. Conway suggested the differences likely reflected <b>the</b> varied diet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sora. <b>The</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> habitat in different seasons is another possible source of seasonal differences in sora habitat.|$|R
5|$|An outward {{shift of}} the PPF results from growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> inputs, such as {{physical}} capital or labour, or from technological progress in {{knowledge of how to}} transform inputs into outputs. Such a shift reflects, for instance, economic growth of an economy already operating at its full productivity (on the PPF), which means that more of both outputs can now be produced during the specified period of time without sacrificing the output of either good. Conversely, the PPF will shift inward if the labor force shrinks, the supply of raw materials is depleted, or a natural disaster decreases the stock of physical capital.|$|E
5|$|Films {{generate}} {{income from}} several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights and merchandising. However, theatrical box office earnings {{are the primary}} metric for trade publications in assessing {{the success of a}} film, mostly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights and merchandise.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the first}} season was scheduled to begin on July 26, 2010, and the primary location was the Paint Hall Studios in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Exterior scenes in Northern Ireland were filmed at Sandy Brae in the Mourne Mountains (standing in for Vaes Dothrak), Castle Ward (Winterfell), Saintfield Estates (the Winterfell godswood), Tollymore Forest (outdoor scenes), Cairncastle (the execution site), the Magheramorne quarry (Castle Black) and Shane's Castle (the tourney grounds). Doune Castle in Stirling, Scotland, was also used in the original pilot episode for scenes at Winterfell. The producers initially considered filming the whole series in Scotland, but decided on Northern Ireland because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> studio space.|$|E

5|$|This species {{grows in}} at least 2 {{distinct}} sub-populations, {{both of which are}} well protected by Sabah National Parks Authority. One of the populations grows in an area public access to which is strictly prohibited without permit. However, there has been a decline in population of mature individuals in the better known and less patrolled site. This is largely due to damage to habitat and plants by careless visitors rather than organised collection of plants. Nepenthes rajah has become common in cultivation in recent years as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> inexpensive clones from tissue culture. I believe that these days commercial collection of this species from the wild is negligible.|$|E
5|$|In a {{long-lived}} {{bird with}} a small clutch size such as the Atlantic puffin, the survival rate of adults {{is an important factor}} influencing the success of the species. Only 5% of the ringed puffins that failed to reappear at the colony did so during the breeding season. The rest were lost some time between departing from land in the summer and reappearing the following spring. The birds spend the winter widely spread out in the open ocean, though there is a tendency for individuals from different colonies to overwinter in different areas. Little is known of their behaviour and diet at sea but no correlation was found between environmental factors, such as temperature variations, and their mortality rate. A combination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> food in winter and summer probably influences the survival of the birds, since individuals starting the winter in poor condition are less likely to survive than those in good condition.|$|E

25|$|Depending on {{the species}} or race of mammoth, the diet {{differed}} somewhat depending on location, although all mammoths ate similar things. For the Columbian mammoth, M. columbi, the diet was mainly grazing. American Columbian mammoths fed primarily on cacti leaves, trees, and shrubs. These assumptions {{were based on}} mammoth feces and mammoth teeth. Mammoths, like modern day elephants, have hypsodont molars. These features also allowed mammoths to live an expansive life because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> grasses and trees.|$|E
25|$|According to American {{psychiatrist}} Loren Mosher, most deinstitutionalisation in the USA {{took place}} after 1972, {{as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> SSI and Social Security Disability, long after the antipsychotic drugs were used universally in state hospitals.
