5|$|Gravitational aggregations {{clustered}} into filaments, leaving voids in the gaps. Gradually, organizations <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> dust merged to {{form the}} first primitive galaxies.

5|$|Interactions between {{galaxies are}} {{relatively}} frequent, {{and they can}} {{play an important role in}} galactic evolution. Near misses between galaxies result in warping distortions due to tidal interactions, and may cause some exchange <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> dust.|$|E
5|$|A {{hierarchical}} structure of matter began to form from minute {{variations in the}} mass density of space. Matter accumulated in the densest regions, forming clouds <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> the earliest stars, the Population III stars. These massive stars triggered the reionization process and {{are believed to have}} created many of the heavy elements in the early Universe, which, through nuclear decay, create lighter elements, allowing the cycle of nucleosynthesis to continue longer.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the coma}} and tail are {{illuminated}} by the Sun and may become visible when a comet passes through the inner Solar System, the dust reflects Sunlight directly while the gases glow from ionisation.

5|$|Comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies, {{typically}} {{only a few}} kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> dust often {{visible to the naked}} eye.|$|E
5|$|Gordon Ramsay Plane Food is a {{restaurant}} owned by chef Gordon Ramsay and located within Terminal 5 of Heathrow Airport, London.

It opened in 2008 alongside the rest of Terminal 5, and with several other Ramsay-related openings that year.

5|$|Ravenscroft {{commissioned}} the architect Thomas Edward Knightley {{to design the}} new hall. Using a floor plan previously prepared by C. J. Phipps, Knightley designed a hall with a floor area of 21,000 square feet (2,000 m²) and an audience capacity of 2,500. Contemporary newspapers commented on the unusual elevation of the building, with the grand tier at street level, and the stalls and arena downstairs. The exterior carving was by Sidney W. Elmes and Son, and the furnishing was by Lapworth Brothers and Harrison. The lighting was a combination <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> electricity.|$|E

5|$|Starburst {{galaxies are}} {{characterized}} by dusty concentrations <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> the appearance of newly formed stars, including massive stars that ionize the surrounding clouds to create H II regions. These massive stars produce supernova explosions, resulting in expanding remnants that interact powerfully with the surrounding gas. These outbursts trigger a chain reaction of star building that spreads throughout the gaseous region. Only when the available gas is nearly consumed or dispersed does the starburst activity end.|$|E
5|$|Stars are {{believed}} to form {{as the result of}} a collapse of a low-temperature cloud <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> dust. As the cloud collapses, conservation of angular momentum causes any small net rotation of the cloud to increase, forcing the material into a rotating disk. At the dense center of this disk a protostar forms, which gains heat from the gravitational energy of the collapse.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way is a barred {{spiral galaxy}} with a {{diameter}} between 100,000 and 180,000 light-years. The Milky Way is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars. There are probably at least 100 billion planets in the Milky Way. The Solar System is located within the disk, about 26,000 light-years from the Galactic Center, on the inner edge {{of one of the}} spiral-shaped concentrations <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> dust called the Orion Arm. The stars in the inner ≈10,000 light-years form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge.

5|$|The architects {{sought to}} create an approachable {{building}} that reflected {{the role of the}} PUB as a public supplier <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> electricity, and this led them to choose strong horizontal elements for the design. In the building's façade, this is achieved with distinctive rows of vertical fins, staggered so as to emphasise horizontal movement; these fins also provide shade. A secondary horizontal pattern results from grouping two or more rows of these fins in blocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of volcanic plumes at Pele and Loki in 1979 provided conclusive evidence that Io was geologically active. Generally, plumes form when volatiles like sulfur and sulfur dioxide are ejected skyward from Io's volcanoes at speeds reaching , creating umbrella-shaped clouds <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> dust. Additional materials {{that might be}} found in the volcanic plumes include sodium, potassium, and chlorine. Although striking in appearance, volcanic plumes are relatively uncommon. Of the 150 or so active volcanoes observed on Io, plumes have only been observed at a couple of dozen of them. The limited area of Io's lava flows suggests that much of the resurfacing needed to erase Io's cratering record must come from plume deposits.|$|E
5|$|The unusually low {{metallicity}} of Vega {{makes it}} a weak Lambda Boötis-type star. However, {{the reason for the}} existence of such chemically peculiar, spectral class A0-F0 stars remains unclear. One possibility is that the chemical peculiarity {{may be the result of}} diffusion or mass loss, although stellar models show that this would normally only occur near the end of a star's hydrogen-burning lifespan. Another possibility is that the star formed from an interstellar medium <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> dust that was unusually metal-poor.|$|E

5|$|The various {{planets are}} thought to have formed from the solar nebula, the {{disc-shaped}} cloud <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> dust left over from the Sun's formation. The currently accepted method by which the planets formed is accretion, in which the planets began as dust grains in orbit around the central protostar. Through direct contact, these grains formed into clumps up to 200 metres in diameter, which in turn collided to form larger bodies (planetesimals) of ~10kilometres (km) in size. These gradually increased through further collisions, growing at the rate of centimetres per year {{over the course of the}} next few million years.|$|E
5|$|Uneven heating {{can cause}} newly {{generated}} gases {{to break out}} of a weak spot on the surface of comet's nucleus, like a geyser. These streams <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> dust can cause the nucleus to spin, and even split apart. In 2010 it was revealed dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide) can power jets of material flowing out of a comet nucleus. Infrared imaging of Hartley 2 shows such jets exiting and carrying with it dust grains into the coma.|$|E
5|$|Welfare was expanded, as {{characterized}} {{by the introduction of}} non-contributory old-age pensions and payments to mothers provided their babies are taken for health checks and that their children attend school. Hundreds of free tractors were also handed out. The prices <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> many foodstuffs were controlled, and local food producers were made to sell in the local market rather than export. A new state-owned body was also set up to distribute food at subsidized prices. All these measures helped to curb inflation, while the economy grew (partly because of rising public spending), accompanied by stronger public finances which brought economic stability.|$|E
