40|$|Abstract: In {{the course}} of the Austrian Research Program <b>on</b> Digital <b>Image</b> <b>Processing</b> an on-line {{engineering}} surveying system has been developed. This system basically consists of two motor driven video-theodolites and a computer with a frame-grabber and a graphics screen. In this paper, the measuring process both for system calibration and object surface reconstruction is described. It heavily relies <b>on</b> digital <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> tools, especially <b>on</b> feature extraction and matching algorithms. In this paper, the feature extraction algorithms used in the system are described, and an outlook on future developments considering the topological relations between the extracted features is given. ...|$|R
