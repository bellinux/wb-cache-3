In this vein the Zimbabwe National Gender Policy (ZNGP) (2000) requires all state universities to implement <b>gender</b> equity programmes <b>through</b> <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> to ensure <b>gender</b> equity in the higher education system. <b>Gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> is aimed at establishing transformative processes and practices to benefit both women and men equally by systematically integrating policies and programmes addressing gender into all aspects of an organizationâ€™s work.

This paper reports on the qualitative component of an investigation of the implementation of gender policy programmes in student admissions in two selected Zimbabwe state universities. Data gathering was conducted through documentary analysis and interviews from expert informants to explore the effectiveness of gender equity in student admissions. Findings, through an appraisal of current gender policy implementation in student admissions, revealed yawning gaps between implementation obtaining in the institutions and ideal practice.

50|$|Gender and {{security}} sector reform is an emerging subfield of security sector reform (SSR) {{that is both}} practical and conceptual. SSR generally is a comprehensive framework within which {{all or part of}} a state's security sector undergoes a process of transformation in order to bring it more into line with principles such as democratic oversight, good governance and the rule of law. The overall objectives of SSR programmes - as defined both by the state in question and any international donors supporting the process - tend to include improving service delivery, enhancing local ownership and ensuring the sustainability of security sector institutions. As gender-specific approaches take into account the specific needs of men, women, boys and girls <b>through</b> <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> and by promoting the equal participation of people of all genders in decision-making processes, states and international organisations increasingly consider them to be a necessary component of SSR programmes.|$|R

40|$|Thirty {{years of}} gender {{equality}} politics From women’s work to <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> This Bachelor thesis examines how the Swedish state has practiced gender equality {{as a political}} project during 1972 until 1999 through the budget bills, using a “What’s the problem represented to be?” approach aiming to uncover which discourses policies are based on. The method also studies what assumptions underlie policy problems, what is left as unproblematic within the policies and what effects are produced by specific problem representations. A central question for the thesis is what has remained and changed within Swedish gender equality politics. The history of the Swedish welfare state {{is presented as a}} background on how gender equality policy has affected the everyday life of women and men. Central concepts for the analyses are: gender equality and gender-power order; rights, resources and interests as three kinds of arguments for gender equality; five categories of arguments for gender equality; and different dimensions of gender segregation. The main results of the study is that the Swedish state during the 1970 ’s above all used gender equality to achieve full employment through increasing women’s participation in the labour market. During the beginning of the 1980 ’s gender equality politics was widened to also include e. g. increasing men’s responsibility for children and homework, but mostly focused on efforts to break the gender segregated labour market. In the late 1980 ’s the state established that women participated in the labour market to the same extent as men, {{at the same time as}} a recession within the gender equality project took place which lasted through the first half of the 1990 ’s. During the second half of the 1990 ’s the state concentrated on establishing a gender perspective within all areas of politics <b>through</b> <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming,</b> which has been the main strategy for gender equality politics since then.  The implications of this is that although represented as a catch-all political issue, <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> serves as an excuse to depoliticise gender equality as a political field. The budget bills have consistently excluded structural analyses on gender quality, until the late 1990 ’s when a power perspective took shape right below the surface for the problem representations...|$|R
40|$|Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) {{programmes}} are {{a fundamental}} component in peacebulding operations and feature in most contemporary peace agreements. Since the conceptualisation of peacebuilding {{in the early}} 1990 s, {{there has been a}} marked shift towards promoting the spread of liberal democracy, rule of law and rejuvenation of markets in countries emerging from conflict. This liberal peacebuilding approach has been criticised by scholars for creating sequencing difficulties, for imposing a form of Western Imperialism and for neglecting the local context. Furthermore, feminists consider this type of peacebuilding as limited as it focuses on the priorities of men in the post-conflict environment and fails to recognise women’s changed roles through conflict or their agency, and frequently expects them to return to conventional gender roles. Despite policy revisions to include women’s perspectives (e. g. UNSCR 1325) women are still viewed as victims and peacemakers, and their roles and needs are not sufficiently addressed. This is acutely evident in DDR programmes, which have neglected many of the concerns of women who help constitute fighting forces in modern warfare. Moves to include women <b>through</b> <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> have not been researched in detail and in this respect this study provides an original contribution to knowledge. This study investigated the <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> of DDRR in Liberia from both implementer and participant perspectives. This hybrid approach reveals that the gender provision only fully exerted an impact within the DD process with campaigns to improve participation. Proxy cases stretched budgets that meant that the <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> of both the RR was virtually non-existent. Women were treated largely the same as men with a programme that focused solely on economic reintegration. Issues of enhancing gender equality were sidelined. Despite the majority not using the skills learnt through DDRR, most gained some empowerment from the process and had reintegrated well despite many showing signs of psychological trauma. Their positive reintegration was not much an effect of DDRR but rather a function of their social reintegration processes and in particular their social networks and community links. These findings represent an advance in understanding of social reintegration in African post-conflict settings {{and the extent to which}} such networks are an important feature of successful reintegration for women. This research advocates policy revisions that incorporate social reintegration as a basis for DDR programmes and use a hybrid approach to planning...|$|R

There are, however, often discrepancies between stated objectives and concrete policy prescriptions. As pertaining to the tension between stated objectives and realities, in this thesis I investigate the friction between, on the one hand, the World Bank's commitment to poverty reduction and <b>gender</b> equality <b>through</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> and, on the other, its' overarching neoliberal framework for development initiatives. I trace the colonization process and draw parallels from this historical advancement and the current 'development framework' in the form of neoliberalism.

I employ the use of a feminist-Gramscian framework to analytically deconstruct the World Bank's proposals, its policy prescriptions and the theory of neoclassical economic theory that informs neoliberalism. I supplement these deconstructions with observations drawn from field research on mainstreaming initiatives in El Salvador.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} European Union (EU) ’s Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) through a {{framework}} based on feminist institutional theory that highlights the durability in {{the dynamics of}} gender relations. Path dependency based on historic features of military institutions—a strict sex division based on “gender war roles”—has influenced the development of different CSDP bodies. The CSDP is sexed because male bodies dominate the organizations studied, yet this remains invisible through normalization. A dominant EU hierarchical military masculinity is institutionalized in the EU’s Military Committee, combat heterosexual masculinity in the Battle groups, and EU protector masculinity in the EU Training missions. The CSDP embodies different types of military masculinities; the relations between them are important for the reproduction of the <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> <b>through</b> a <b>gendered</b> logic of appropriateness. Yet, this too is invisible {{as part of the}} informal aspects of organizations. While women’s bodies are written out of the CSDP, the construction of femininity in relation to the protector/protected binary is central to it. Two protected femininities are read in the texts. The vulnerable femininity of women in conflict areas is important for how the CSDP understands itself in relation to <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming.</b> In relation to the vulnerable femininity, CSDP constructs an EU protector masculinity, in turn, set against an aggressive violent masculinity in the areas where missions are deployed.

40|$|<b>Gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> was {{introduced}} within the European Union (EU) in the 1990 s {{as a means}} of addressing the unequal treatment of employed women. Yet its impact on organizational practices in Europe has been limited. This review synthesizes and analyses theoretical and policy literatures on <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> within the EU between 1998 and 2011. It highlights ambiguities within <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> literatures regarding whether <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> is, first and foremost, a policy or a strategy. It further identifies ambiguities regarding how inequality should be articulated: in terms of the sameness or difference between women's and men's concerns, and in the context of whether <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> research should be defined as focusing primarily on ‘women’ or on ‘gender’. The paper suggests that such ambiguity of definition within <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> literatures compromises the implementation of <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> within organizational practices. It further observes the need, within some <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> theoretical and policy literatures, to move away from stable definitions of ‘male’ and ‘female’ (which identify women's and men's concerns as often in contrast) towards a more situated approach. The paper contributes to future <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> research by proposing a more fluid, post-structural and sociocultural interpretation of ‘gender’.

Since the 1990 s, HIV/AIDS policymakers, donors, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and transnational corporations have adopted <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> as the process for integrating gender into development programmes and institutions. There is an increasing body of literature on the successes and challenges of practicing <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> within organisational environments, however, little {{has been said about}} this practice within HIV/AIDS-specific organisational environments. As a contribution to this gap, this reflective paper aims to generate debate about some of the considerations for <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> practice in HIV/AIDS organisations. It draws on the author's experience conducting a <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> review with a southern African HIV/AIDS capacity-strengthening organisation, as well as a review of the development literature on <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming.</b> The paper looks at three key issues facing gender mainstreaming: (1) donor requirements on disaggregating data by sex; (2) connecting <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> with the priorities of community HIV/AIDS organisations; and, (3) the role of resistance to <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> as neo-colonial. Preliminary understandings of these issues suggest that current approaches to <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> may not be flexible enough to consider the multiple ways gender and HIV/AIDS interact in different socio-cultural contexts.

40|$|Bei dem Evaluationsbericht von Hildegard Macha und Kolleginnen handelt es sich um eine detaillierte organisationssoziologische Analyse und Reflexion der Einführung von <b>Gender</b> <b>Mainstreaming</b> an der Universität Augsburg. Während im ersten Teil des Buches vor allem die grundlegenden theoretischen Prämissen und deren Entwicklung vorgestellt werden, werden im zweiten Teil die konkreten Einzelmaßnahmen bewertet. Die Evaluation des zwischen 2003 und 2006 durchgeführten Best-Practice-Projekts gibt praxisorientierte Anregungen zur Implementierung von <b>Gender</b> <b>Mainstreaming,</b> wobei die theoretische Rahmung v. a. durch den Rückgriff auf systemtheoretische Begrifflichkeiten geboten wird. Der Fokus liegt dabei schwerpunktmäßig auf dem Aspekt des <b>Gender</b> <b>Mainstreaming</b> und weniger auf einer differenzierten Sicht auf das Thema Diversity. This {{evaluation}} report by Hildegard Macha {{and her colleagues}} is a detailed organization sociological analysis of and reflection on the introduction of <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> at the University of Augsburg. While {{the first part of}} the book mainly presents the basic theoretical premises and their development, the second part evaluates the actual individual measures. The evaluation of the best practice project, conducted between 2003 and 2006, gives practical suggestions for the implementation of <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming,</b> while the theoretical framing is offered mainly through the recourse on system theoretical terminology. In doing so, the focus is predominantly on the aspect of <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> instead of a differentiated view on the topic of diversity...|$|R
40|$|<b>Gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> has the {{ambition}} to promote policy learning. The specific {{problem that is}} the focus of this article centres on the conditions for learning as part of <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> in public procurement processes. The article is based on a case study of an occupational health project in a municipality in northern Sweden where <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> was included in public procurement as part of the initiative. The main question asked is: can public procurement be an instrument for policy learning in <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming?</b> The results show that policy learning was part of the process for both the contractor and the suppliers. The municipality and the suppliers also to some extent engaged in co-learning and joint development work. The article discusses some limitations and problems that were encountered. The results showed that the relevant question was not only whether policy learning can occur but what kind of learning is possible and necessary for the envisioned policy outcomes in terms of <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming.</b> The study highlights the dilemmas encountered in public procurement processes and their consequences for policy learning. The study also contributes {{to an understanding of the}} application, and outcomes, of <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> in different contexts.

40|$|Rapidly {{spreading}} {{in popularity}} {{over the past}} fifteen years, <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> has been adopted worldwide by state, supra state and international organizations as the "most modern‟ policy for ensuring gender equality. Yet, there is general agreement {{that it has not}} succeeded in achieving its radical potential. In this thesis, I bring together policy literature on bureaucracies, the civil service, and <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> with work done on gender, work and organizations as a way to better understand the partial success and uneven implementation and institutionalization of what is supposedly a transformational agenda. To date, gender scholars have underplayed the "stickiness‟ of gender and its effects upon actors and everyday practices in political and state organizations. I argue that the "stickiness‟ of gender in organisations presents a formidable obstacle to the implementation and institutionalization of <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming.</b> I also argue that insufficient {{attention has been paid to}} the "embodied costs‟ of actors who act as internal <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> advocates both in terms of the costs to the individuals and the impact of these costs on the prospects for the successful implementation and institutionalisation of a radical change agenda. Through an ethnographic examination of the Scottish Executive from 2006 - 2007, I probe the analytic question framing this thesis: what happens to the radical potential of <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> during its implementation and institutionalisation in governmental bureaucracies? Using the sociological method of institutional ethnography, I provide evidence of ways that continued reliance on highly committed individuals and everyday bureaucratic practices continue to limit the radical success of <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> at the Scottish Executive. I contend that the radical promise of <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> is hindered because it is a strategy which must work within the confines of fossilised norms manifested in masculinist bureaucracies and because it is paradoxically predicated on changing bureaucratic norms through the use of the same bureaucratic practices it attempts to transform. By examining the everyday experience of "doing‟ <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> in the case of a sub-state government in the UK, the Scottish Executive, I trace the ways that the radical promises of the <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> agenda become diluted. The thesis examines challenges to the <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> agenda and adds to wider discussions about the plausibility of gender mainstreaming‟s radical potential. In addition, my thesis moves forward methodological discussions in feminist politics by demonstrating the possibility of using institutional ethnography in political science as an effective way to operationalise, analyze and link multiple levels of politics from a gendered perspective. My analysis of local experiences of <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> provides insight into the international trend of <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> because it takes seriously the experiences of individuals who work within organizations, the role of organizations in limiting change agendas, and the international context within which the mainstreaming strategy unfolds.
