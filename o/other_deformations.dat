40|$|Models for Venusian {{mountain}} belt formation {{are important}} for understanding planetary geodynamic mechanisms. A range of data sets at various scales {{must be considered in}} geodynamic modelling. Long wavelength data, such as gravity and geoid to topography ratios, need constraints from smaller-scale observations of the surface. Pre-Magellan images of the Venusian surface were not of high enough resolution to observe details of surface deformation. High-resolution Magellan images of Maxwell Montes and the <b>other</b> <b>deformation</b> belts allow us to determine the nature of surface deformation. With these images we can begin to understand the constraints that surface deformation places on planetary dynamic models. Maxwell Montes and three <b>other</b> <b>deformation</b> belts (Akna, Freyja, and Danu montes) surround the highland plateau Lakshmi Planum in Venus' northern hemisphere. Maxwell, the highest of these belts, stands 11 km above mean planetary radius. We present a detailed structural and kinematic study of Maxwell Montes. Key observations include (1) dominant structure fabrics are broadly distributed and show little change in spacing relative to elevation changes of several kilometers; (2) the spacing, wavelength and inferred amplitude of mapped structures are small; (3) interpreted extensional structures occur only in areas of steep slope, with no extension at the highest topographic levels; and (4) deformation terminates abruptly at the base of steep slopes. One implications of these observations is that topography is independent of thin-skinned, broadly distributed, Maxwell deformation. Maxwell is apparently stable, with no observed extensional collapse. We propose a 'deformation-from-below' model for Maxwell, in which the crust deforms passively over structurally imbricated and thickened lower crust. This model may have implications for the <b>other</b> <b>deformation</b> belts...|$|R

50|$|MRI is {{considered}} the best method of detecting aqueductal stensosis because it can visualize {{the entire length of}} the aqueduct, can clearly depict tumors, and can show ventricle enlargement or <b>other</b> <b>deformations.</b> It is helpful in determining the extent of the aqueductal obstruction, particularly when multiple masses or lesions are present, and thereby aids in determining the most appropriate treatment method (i.e. surgery, shunt, or ETV).

5000|$|Diego López II's memory quickly {{underwent}} attacks. As soon as 1216, {{during the}} regency of the Lara brothers, when Lope Díaz II {{was trying to}} play a political role, the royal chancellery issued a charter judging him a bad lord. Diego López's image constructed around 1240-1241 by the chronicler Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada, Toledo's archbishop, who had known him personally, was already very ambiguous. He criticized his exile strategy {{that led him to}} face his king on the battlefield. The tombs of Diego López and of his wife Toda Pérez, in the cloister of knights of the abbey of Santa María de Nájera, were both realized {{during the second half of}} the 13th century. They bear testimony of the specific interest of the Haros for this founder ancestor. During 1270-1280, when Lope Díaz III was brought against King Alfonso X of Castile-León, in nobiliary rebellions ever more open, intellectuals from the court denigrated the reputation of Diego López [...] "said the Good", to whom the responsibility of the defeat of Alarcos was for the first time attributed. Writers supporting the Haros invented in this period an equivalent myth to justify Diego López II's attitude and to charge the monarchy. The story of the Jewish girl from Toledo, which explains the rout at Alarcos with the sins of Alfonso VIII, appeared towards the end of the 13th century. During 1340, the books of the Portuguese count Pedro de Barcelos, the Crónica Geral de 1344 and the Livros de linhagens definitely turned the biography of Diego López II into a myth. This author relates episodes allegedly historical, but similar to well known literary themes from Brittany (Arthurian romances) and French epic. He converted him into an ambiguous character, in a pseudo-historical attempt to synthesize his dark image and his golden legend. In the middle of the 15th century, Lope García de Salázar, in his Crónica de Vizcaya, finally imagined the nickname [...] "the Bad" [...] to explain the contradictions in his biography. His memory suffered later <b>other</b> <b>deformations,</b> according to the interests of the 16th-century genealogists working for the nobility, and, from the 17th century on, of Basque historians.

40|$|A {{metastable}} β-Ti alloy, Ti- 10 V- 3 Fe- 3 Al (wt. %), {{was subjected}} to thermomechanical processing (TMP), where the temperature of isothermal holding in the α + β phase field was varied in order to change the volume fraction of the α phase and, correspondingly, the β phase stability. Following TMP, compression tests were performed at room temperature to evaluate the deformation mode. Microstructural features induced by compression were identified using transmission electron microscopy. It was found that { 3 3 2 }〈 1 1 3 〉β deformation twinning along with stress-induced products (α″ martensite and ω lamellae) and slip were operational in the least stable β.

40|$|We {{propose a}} layered {{framework}} for incorporating example-based skinning algorithms such as Pose Space Deformation or Shape-by-Example into an existing character animation system. The challenge in implementing example-based skinning in an existing system {{lies in the}} fact that it is generally believed that the interpolation of the examples is best performed before doing other skinning deformations (although there has been no analysis as to why this is the case), whereas the examples are specified by the user after the <b>other</b> <b>deformations</b> are performed. It is therefore necessary to invert the operation of these skinning and deformation operators. Existing systems typically allow layering of both basic skinning methods such as Skeleton Subspace Deformation (SSD) and <b>other</b> <b>deformations</b> such as lattices, etc., and commercial systems may further allow additional proprietary deformation algorithms as part of the character skinning. Unfortunately, understanding and accessing their various parameters can be laborious at best, and we do not have access to the algorithms in the case of commercial packages.
