5|$|Artificial ruins, {{built to}} {{resemble}} remnants of historic edifices, {{were also a}} hallmark of the period. They were usually built as centre pieces in aristocratic planned landscapes. Follies were similar, although they differed from artificial ruins in that they were not part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>planned</b> landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built. Both drew on elements of castle architecture such as castellation and towers, but served no military purpose and were solely for display.|$|E

Soviet officials accepted this invitation, but they only allowed the film to screen at the festival out of competition, and it was screened just once at 4 A.M. {{on the final day of}} the festival. Audience response nevertheless was enthusiastic, and the film won the FIPRESCI prize. Soviet officials tried to prevent the official release of the film in France and other countries, but were not successful as the French distributor had legally acquired the rights in 1969.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1943, it {{had become}} clear that the initial {{estimates}} {{of the size of}} the town had been too low, and a second phase of construction was required. Plans now called for a town of 42,000 people. Work began in the fall of 1943, and continued into the late summer of 1944. Hospitals were expanded, as were the police and fire services, and the telephone system. Only 4,793 <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>planned</b> total of 6,000 family houses were built, mostly on the East Town area and the undeveloped stretch along State Route 61. They were supplemented by 55 new dormitories, 2,089 trailers, 391 hutments, a cantonment area of 84 hutments and 42 barracks. Some 2,823 of the family units were prefabricated off-site. The high school was expanded to cater for 1,000 students. Two additional primary schools were built, and existing ones were expanded so that they could accommodate 7,000 students.|$|E
5|$|During the winter, the Mayflower colonists {{suffered}} {{greatly from}} lack of shelter, diseases such as scurvy, and general conditions onboard ship. Many of the able-bodied men were too infirm to work; 45 out of 102 pilgrims died and were buried on Cole's Hill. Thus, only seven residences (<b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>planned</b> nineteen) and four common houses were constructed during the first winter. By the end of January, enough of the settlement had been built to begin unloading provisions from the Mayflower. In mid-February, after several tense encounters with local Native Americans, the male residents of the settlement organized themselves into military orders; Myles Standish was designated as the commanding officer. By {{the end of the}} month, five cannons had been defensively positioned on Fort Hill. John Carver was elected governor to replace Governor Martin.|$|E
