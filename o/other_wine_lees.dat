40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the potential of}} wine industry by-product, the lees, as a rich mixture of natural polyphenols, and its physiological potential to reduce postprandial metabolic and oxidative stress caused by a cholesterol-rich diet in in vivo model. Chemical analysis of <b>wine</b> <b>lees</b> showed that their total solid content was 94. 2 %. <b>Wine</b> <b>lees</b> contained total phenols, total nonflavonoids and total flavonoids expressed in mg of gallic acid equivalents per 100 g of dry mass: 2316. 6 ± 37. 9, 1332. 5 ± 51. 1 and 984. 1 ± 28. 2, respectively. The content of total anthocyanins expressed in mg of cyanidin- 3 -glucoside equivalents per 100 g of dry mass was 383. 1 ± 21. 6. Antioxidant capacity of <b>wine</b> <b>lees</b> determined by the DPPH and FRAP methods and expressed in mM of Trolox equivalents per 100 g was 259. 8 ± 1. 8 and 45. 7 ± 1. 05, respectively. The experiment lasted 60 days using C 57 BL/ 6 mice divided in four groups: group 1 was fed normal diet and used as control, group 2 was fed normal diet with added <b>wine</b> <b>lees,</b> group 3 was fed high-cholesterol diet (HCD), i. e. normal diet {{with the addition of}} sunflower oil, and group 4 was fed HCD with <b>wine</b> <b>lees.</b> HCD increased serum total cholesterol (TC) by 2. 3 -fold, triacylglycerol (TAG) by 1. 5 -fold, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by 3. 5 -fold and liver malondialdehyde (MDA) by 50 %, and reduced liver superoxide dismutase (SOD) by 50 %, catalase (CAT) by 30 % and glutathione (GSH) by 17. 5 % compared to control. Conversely, treatment with HCD and <b>wine</b> <b>lees</b> reduced TC and LDL up to 1. 4 times more than with HCD only, with depletion of lipid peroxidation (MDA) and restoration of SOD and CAT activities in liver, approximating values of the control. HDL levels were unaffected in any group. Serum transaminase activity showed no hepatotoxic properties in the treatment with lees alone.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{anaerobic}} co-digestion of <b>wine</b> <b>lees</b> together with {{waste activated sludge}} in mesophilic and thermophilic conditions was tested at pilot scale.

One possible approach is the anaerobic co-digestion of waste {{activated sludge}} with others organic substrates in mesophilic and thermophilic conditions in order to exploit the spare volume of existing reactors, recover energy from biogas production, and obtain a fertilizer as final product. The anaerobic trials were carried out at pilot scale, applying two organic loading rates (2. 8 and 4. 5 kg chemical oxygen demand (COD) /(m 3 ·d)) with a hydraulic retention time of 16 and 21 days. Among agro-wastes, <b>wine</b> <b>lees</b> were chosen because of their continuous availability throughout the year, and their high COD content (up to 200 - 300 g/l, 70 % soluble, on average). The addition of <b>wine</b> <b>lees</b> to activated sludge determined a higher biogas production (best yield was 0. 40 Nm 3 /kgCODfed) improving the energetic balance of the sludge line of the WWTP. The characterization of both substrates fed and digester effluents was carried out in terms of heavy metals; comparison with EC proposed limits showed that, due to high content of Cu in <b>wine</b> <b>lees,</b> the loading rate of this agro-waste should be limited to maintain good characteristics of final biosolids. © IWA Publishing 2014...|$|R

The adsorption measured on some deactivated yeasts of wine fermentation shows that Saccharomyces cerevisiae are the most active in FEN retention.

40|$|This work {{focused on}} the study of {{ultrasound}} (US) treatment effects on <b>wine</b> <b>lees,</b> in order to verify the possibility of accelerating the protective colloids (i. e., polysaccharides) release. Moreover, these effects were compared with the usual practices of aging <b>wine</b> over <b>lees</b> and with the enzyme treatment of lees by means of betaglucanases able to demolish the glucans and facilitate the release of intracellular components. This work was performed considering the possibility of setting up a technology applicable in a cellar. Ultrasound treatment on <b>wine</b> <b>lees</b> resulted in an increase in total colloids, proteins, and polysaccharides in the medium with a reduction in the colloids particle diameter. These results were mainly correlated with treatment duration rather than its intensity. Treatment at 90 % amplitude for 3 min provided good enough results in terms of colloids release, and therefore, it was used for the comparative study with natural lysis and enzyme treatment. The parameters evaluated showed that the ultrasound treatment resulted in an increased release of colloids from yeast (polysaccharides and glycoproteins); therefore, a significant effect on the extraction of cellular components compared to the long stay on the lees was detected, indicating the interesting advantage that this new technological application can bring to the winemaking process...|$|R

After fermentation, the starch content in the yeast culture reduced from 32. 2 % § 0. 5 % to 7. 5 % § 0. 2 %, and the contents of crude protein and peptide increased from 36. 1 % § 0. 8 % to 48. 0 % § 1. 0 % and 3. 9 % § 0. 2 % to 7. 2 % § 0. 4 %, respectively.

40|$|This is a {{study on}} the {{volatile}} composition of grappa low-wines. Grappa low wines are the first distillation products, with about 15 - 20 % v/v ethanol, when grappa is produced using continuous distillation. Different methods and conditions of marc and <b>wine</b> <b>lees</b> storage on an industrial scale have been considered. New technology for the storage of large amounts of grape marc, called the 'Grappa system', was evaluated. By comparison with a traditional ensilage method, the low-wines obtained from the Grappa system resulted in higher concentrations of ethanol, lower levels of methanol, slightly different concentrations of fusel alcohols and higher concentrations of ethyl esters and terpenes. The use of phosphoric acid and sodium methabisulphate to achieve a partial control of marc fermentation had no effects using the Grappa system method. This could be the result of the mixing technique used which was spraying alone and was only slightly effective for the homogenous treatment of the mass. On the contrary, the lower content of methanol, 2 -butanol and n-propanol confirmed the effectiveness of phosphoric acid addition to the <b>wine</b> <b>lees...</b>|$|R

And, they also reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory genes such as COX- 2, TNF-alpha and iNOS. To understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the inhibition of inflammation in (KSD-E 4 - 3) -treated RAW 264. 7 cells, we carried out oligo DNA microarray analysis using Agilent Mouse microarray.
