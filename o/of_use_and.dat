It was built in the mid-19th century, between 1856 and 1862, as part of the fortification system of the Bay of Kotor at the time of the Austrian Empire. By its monumentality and unique structure, it presents an exceptional example of military architecture of its time.

5|$|Alcohol has a {{long history}} <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> misuse {{throughout}} recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others, its abuse was condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness led to the failed prohibition of alcohol being considered and eventually enforced briefly in America. In 2005 alcohol dependence and abuse was estimated to cost the US economy approximately 220 billion dollars per year, more than cancer and obesity.|$|E

Command of the unit was given to the newly promoted Major Appleyard. At the end of 1942, most of SSRF were moved to Algeria and absorbed into the 2nd Special Air Service Regiment. Appleyard did not survive the war. He was returning from a Special Air Service mission when his plane was reported missing. It was the same day that Captain Hayes was executed in Paris.|$|E

5|$|Electrode {{coatings}} can {{consist of}} a number of different compounds, including rutile, calcium fluoride, cellulose, and iron powder. Rutile electrodes, coated with 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking. Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, iron powder is a common coating additive that increases {{the rate at which the}} electrode fills the weld joint, up to twice as fast.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the Metropolitan line-operated Inner Circle route {{was given}} its own {{identity}} {{on the tube}} map as the Circle line. In June 1957, the reversing bay track was taken out <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> the track bed was later filled to connect the two island platforms. The eastbound MR platform (Number 1) and westbound DR platform (Number 4) were taken out of use in January 1966 and March 1969 respectively. The tracks for these platforms were also removed and platform 4 was subsequently demolished in the early 1970s to allow escalators to be provided to the Piccadilly line. The widened island platform is now served by the District and Circle lines in both directions. Following the closure of platforms 1 and 4, platform 3 was renumbered as 1. The current arrangement has trains running in opposite directions to the original layout. During service disruption or engineering works, trains can also run Eastbound from Platform 1. The arcaded station entrance and shops, the brick retaining walls to the sub-surface platforms and the Exhibition Road pedestrian tunnel are Grade II listed structures.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the {{eastbound}} Circle line platform {{was taken}} out <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> the track layout was rearranged to remove the westbound Circle line track and widen the island platform. The eastbound Circle and District lines both serve {{the north side of}} the island platform and the westbound Circle line which was redirected to serve the south side of the island platform. The disused platform is used for Art on the Underground installations, often placed into the brick recesses in the northern retaining wall. In the 1990s a deck was constructed above the District and Circle line platforms on which was constructed a shopping mall and apartment building.|$|E

5|$|Rail {{transportation}} {{in the village}} began in 1880 with the small Whitson's Station on the New York City & Northern Railroad (later the New York and Putnam Railroad); the station was rebuilt by Walter Law in 1906 {{in the style of}} his Briarcliff Lodge, with Mission style furniture and rugs. The old station was moved to Millwood, New York around that time to become its station; it fell out <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> was demolished May 9, 2012, although plans exist {{for the construction of a}} replica. Law's Briarcliff station became the public library in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Several {{types of}} incense clock have been found, {{the most common}} forms include the incense stick and incense seal. An incense stick clock was an incense stick with calibrations; most were elaborate, {{sometimes}} having threads, with weights attached, at even intervals. The weights would drop onto a platter or gong below, signifying that {{a certain amount of}} time had elapsed. Some incense clocks were held in elegant trays; open-bottomed trays were also used, to allow the weights to be used together with the decorative tray. Sticks of incense with different scents were also used, so that the hours were marked by a change in fragrance. The incense sticks could be straight or spiraled; the spiraled ones were longer, and were therefore intended for long periods <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> <b>and</b> often hung from the roofs of homes and temples.|$|E
5|$|The line {{received}} centralized {{traffic control}} in four phases: from Trondheim to Stjørdal on 11 January 1976, to Levanger on 9 January 1977, to Steinkjer on 6 December 1977 and to Snåsa on 23 November 1984. Bergsgrav Station was opened on 6 December 1977. In 1981, Di4-locomotives were introduced. The spur to Øyanmoen was taken out <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> removed in October 1982. NSB introduced Class 92 diesel multiple units in 1985, cutting travel time on local services between Steinkjer and Trondheim by 25 minutes. In 1989, the station building at Sunnan was demolished. In 1989 and 1990, five stations were closed, consisting on Sandferhus, Vold, Vollan, Vist and Sunnan.|$|E

5|$|The trams were {{unidirectional}} and had {{a single}} door at the front and a double door in the middle, both on the right side. Class E also had a single door at the rear. The trams were originally delivered with two apartments, with a wall and inside door {{in front of the}} centre door. This was removed after the trams became smoke-free. They had a partial wooden interior, with linoleum floors. Various renovations changed the panelling, usually variations of brown and yellow. The trams originally had incandescent light bulbs, but these were replaced with fluorescent lamps after 1955. From 1970 to 1974, the trams were rebuilt to remove the conductor, and the driver was given space for a purse and ticket machine, as well as an announcement system. The E-series eventually had the rear door taken out <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> blocked with an extra seat.|$|E
5|$|Thus in this version, Simon did not {{immediately}} demolish the Acra, but instead had it occupied and may even have resided within it himself. 1 Maccabees does not mention its ultimate fate.

5|$|To age the notes, between 40 and 50 prisoners {{stood in}} two columns {{and passed the}} notes among them to {{accumulate}} dirt, sweat and general wear and tear. Some of the prisoners would fold and refold the notes, others would pin the corners to replicate how a bank clerk would collect bundles of notes. British names and addresses were written on the reverse, as happened with some English notes, and numbers were written on the front – duplicating how a bank teller would mark {{the value of a}} bundle. Four grades of note quality were introduced: grade 1 was the highest quality, to be used in neutral countries and by Nazi spies; grade 2 was to be used to pay collaborators; grade 3 was for notes that were to be possibly dropped over Britain; grade 4 were too flawed to be <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|To {{construct}} the new Central line platforms, the larger diameter station tunnels were manually excavated around the existing running tunnels whilst trains continued to run. When the excavations were complete, the original segmental tunnel linings were dismantled. The new platforms came into use on 25 September 1933 replacing those of British Museum, which had closed the day before. As {{part of the}} modernisation the station was renamed Holborn (Kingsway) on 22 May 1933, but the suffix gradually dropped out <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> no longer appears on station signage or tube maps. The new platforms at Holborn led {{to the number of}} passengers switching between the lines increasing tenfold by 1938.|$|E
