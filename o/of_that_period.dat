5|$|Glastonbury Methodist Church on Lambrook Street {{was built}} in 1843 and has a galleried interior, typical of a non-conformist chapel <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>period,</b> but an unusual number of stained glass windows.

5|$|Architectural {{historians have}} grouped the Precious Blood-related churches of far western Ohio into four {{different}} generations: the first, composed primarily of small log buildings {{from the first}} years of settlement until 1865; the second, composed of moderately sized brick churches built between 1865 and 1885; the third, composed mostly of large High Gothic Revival churches with massive towers constructed from 1885 to 1905; and the fourth, composed of churches built between 1905 and 1925 {{in a wide range of}} styles. Immaculate Conception's place at the end of the third generation is significant: its Romanesque Revival style is atypical <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>period</b> and much more common in the fourth generation that would soon arise, putting it in somewhat of a transitional place between the third and fourth generations.|$|E

In Barça's last home league match on 5 May, against Espanyol, Messi scored all four goals before approaching the bench to embrace Guardiola, who had announced his resignation as manager. He finished the season as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for a second time, with 50 goals, an all-time La Liga record, while his 73 goals in all competitions surpassed Gerd Müller's 67 goals in the 1972–73 Bundesliga season, making him the single-season top scorer in the history of European club football.|$|E
