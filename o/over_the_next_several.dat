The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system on August 4 and it was designated a tropical depression by both the JTWC and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) later that day. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August 5, and the JMA designated it Tropical Storm Saomai.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} damage, Henderson {{personnel}} {{were able to}} restore one of the runways to operational condition within a few hours. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> weeks, the CAF gradually recovered as Allied forces delivered more aircraft, fuel, and aircrew personnel to Guadalcanal.

An opening ceremony was held on October5, 1997, with local, regional and provincial politicians in attendance. The new expressway opened to vehicular traffic ten days later on October15. The cost of the parkway, initially projected at $187 million, was under budget at $180 million.|$|E
5|$|After Hitler's death, Speer {{offered his}} {{services}} to the so-called Flensburg Government, headed by Hitler's successor, Karl Dönitz, and took {{a significant role in}} that short-lived regime. On May15, an allied delegation arrived and asked Speer if {{he would be willing to}} provide information on the effects of the air war. Speer agreed, and <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> days, provided information on a broad range of subjects. On May23, two weeks after the surrender of German forces, British troops arrested the members of the Flensburg Government and brought Nazi Germany to a formal end.|$|E
50|$|In 1997, Beijing {{authorities}} {{carried out}} a project assessing the city’s Green GDP.

50|$|<b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> month, <b>several</b> MILF commanders were tagged by {{government}} officials as having initiated an offensive campaign. This was responded by the Armed Forces of the Philippines, which immediately deployed ten battalions composed {{of a total of}} 6,000 soldiers into Mindanao under the command of Lt. Gen. Cardozo Luna. <b>The</b> violence displaced <b>over</b> 600,000 people and left about 300 dead.|$|R
50|$|The {{preserve}} {{began as}} a donation of 190 acre of land in 1993 by the Spring Creek Angus Ranch Partnership in memory of Leland Swaner. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> decade <b>several</b> parcels of land would be added, growing the preserve to more than 1000 acre.

5|$|Andrić {{had been}} Yugoslavia's {{ambassador}} to Germany from 1939 to 1941, {{during the early}} years of World War II, and was arrested by the Germans in April 1941, following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. In June 1941, he was allowed to return to German-occupied Belgrade but was confined to a friend's apartment in conditions that some biographers liken to house arrest. The novel was one of three that Andrić wrote <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> years. All three were published in short succession in 1945, following Belgrade's liberation from the Nazis. The Bridge on the Drina was published in March of that year to widespread acclaim.|$|E
5|$|Carlton {{delivered}} the series to ITV in August 2003 for broadcast {{in the autumn}} schedules, but it was then rescheduled four times <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> months, before ITV eventually set a premiere date of 11 July 2004. It was then rescheduled to the preceding Wednesday, in the 9 pm slot. The series lost two million viewers over two weeks and ITV pulled episode four from the schedules on the morning before it was due for broadcast, replacing it with It Shouldn't Happen on a TV Soap, a bloopers programme, which returned ITV's ratings to above the five million mark.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{damaging}} {{air attacks}} to their ships and landing forces, the Japanese proceeded {{with the construction}} of the naval seaplane base at Tulagi and Gavutu, receiving more shipments of troops and construction workers <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> months. The base was soon operational with aircraft from the Yokohama Air Group which conducted air reconnaissance patrols throughout the surrounding area beginning on 6 May. On 27 May, the Japanese inspected the Lunga Point area on Guadalcanal as a possible location to build a large airfield. On 13 June, the Naval General Staff approved the construction of an airfield at that location and on 19 June, Admiral Inoue toured the site in anticipation of the airfield construction effort. The next day, Japanese troops began clearing the area of brush, and on 6 July, a 12-ship convoy delivered 2,000 Korean and Japanese construction workers plus 500 Japanese naval combat troops to conduct the airfield construction effort in earnest. The coastwatchers on Guadalcanal and Allied air reconnaissance observed the Japanese airfield construction efforts. Allied Catalinas and B-17s based at Port Moresby, Efate, Noumea, and Espiritu Santo frequently bombed the Japanese bases on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Gavutu <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> months, but without causing significant damage. Several Japanese float fighters and one Allied bomber were destroyed in aerial combat during the missions.|$|E
50|$|The first sit-in {{happened}} in February 1960 when four black students from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University {{sat down at}} a segregated Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina. The movement spread across the South, reaching Rock Hill on Feb. 12, when about 100 black students staged sit-ins at various downtown lunch counters. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> year, <b>several</b> sit-ins were held in the city.|$|R
50|$|The site {{opened to}} the public on 26 May 1962, the {{construction}} having cost £2 million. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> decade <b>several</b> attractions were added: the miniature railway in 1964, the chairlifts in 1965, and the monorail in 1967. Full size locomotives, Duchess of Hamilton and Knowle, were added in 1964. The locomotives left the camp in 1974 and have since been restored and preserved.|$|R
50|$|Leo Schunck {{had started}} making plans for still further expansion, even going national. But <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> eight years, <b>several</b> {{setbacks}} caused {{the business to}} shrink from 825 employees to 500, 400 of whom in Heerlen.|$|R
5|$|Hart {{arrived in}} his home town of Carterton to a hero's welcome on 25 April 1919, five {{years to the day}} after being landed at Gallipoli. The guest of honour at several receptions held around the Wairarapa <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> days, he made a point of {{acknowledging}} the role played by the ordinary soldier in the eventual victory over the Germans while downplaying his own contributions. He was eventually discharged from the NZEF in late May 1919. His services in the war were subsequently recognised with his appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath. The French government also awarded him with the Croix de guerre.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Hernan was {{the ninth}} {{tropical}} depression, eighth named storm, fifth hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 2008 Pacific hurricane season. Hernan developed {{out of a}} tropical wave that formed off {{the east coast of}} Africa on July 24. Over the next week, the wave traversed the Atlantic without development and entered the Eastern Pacific basin on August 2. The wave became better organized <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> days and was declared Tropical Depression Nine-E on August 6. The depression quickly became Tropical Storm Hernan later that day. Hernan steadily intensified over the next two days and was upgraded to a hurricane on the morning of August 8.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, while {{pitching}} on a wet mound in Cleveland, Shuey {{injured his}} right hip. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> seasons, he had multiple surgeries on his hip, including repairing a torn labrum and removing bone spurs. He finished the 1999 season with an 8–5 record, a 3.53 ERA, and six saves. His eight wins {{tied for the}} most among Cleveland's relief pitchers. In 2000, new Indians' manager Charlie Manuel indicated the Indians would attempt to shift Shuey into the closer role. When Shuey spent time {{on the disabled list}}, Steve Karsay served as the Indians' closer. He again spent time on the disabled list in 2001 with a strained elbow ligament.|$|E
50|$|By 1933, State Route 25 was {{extended}} westward. It followed US 93/State Route 7 south through Caliente and west to Crystal Springs, where it headed northwest towards U.S. Route 6/State Route 4 ending near Tonopah. The western segment of route underwent numerous realignments <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few <b>several</b> years, {{with the western}} terminus shifting eastward on US 6 to Warm Springs {{by the time the}} highway was paved in 1958.|$|R
50|$|<b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 3 decades, <b>several</b> hundred researchers, {{mainly in}} the {{discipline}} of education, have used the Chambers DAST to gauge various social, cultural and educational factors in student perception of science and the scientist.

50|$|International {{drug control}} {{began with the}} 1912 International Opium Convention, a treaty which adopted import and export {{restrictions}} on the opium poppy's psychoactive derivatives. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> half-century, <b>several</b> additional treaties were adopted under League of Nations auspices, gradually expanding the list of controlled substances to encompass cocaine and other drugs and granting the Permanent Central Opium Board power to monitor compliance. After the United Nations was formed in 1945, those enforcement functions passed to the UN.|$|R
5|$|In 2000, Endtime Productions {{released}} Martyrium with cover art {{done by the}} reputive Swedish metal music cover artist Kristian Wåhlin. Antestor {{toured the}} United States with Extol that year, playing small venues and finally performing at Cornerstone Festival. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> years, the band remained somewhat quiet; they did not release any more albums until 2003, when they re-released their two earliest demos on one CD, titling it The Defeat of Satan. The drummer, Svein Sander (in Antestor, Armoth), left the band during this time, and Antestor would not find a new full-time drummer for several more years.|$|E

He challenged Paul Burchill for the OVW Heavyweight Championship in mid-2008, but was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|<b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> days, Bilis moved {{generally}} northwestward toward Taiwan, slowly strengthening over open waters. Bilis {{was designated}} a severe tropical storm by the JMA on July 11, but the storm did not strengthen much further {{over the next}} few days due to a marginal upper-air environment and dry air entrainment. PAGASA upgraded the system to typhoon status on July 12, but the JMA never officially recognized the system as such in its advisories. Bilis reached its official peak intensity of 60knots (110km/h, 70mph) later that day.|$|E

25|$|Felman {{continued}} {{arguing that}} Mihailović and his Chetniks should be honored for their rescue of US pilots. In 1970, {{he went on}} the Congressional Record pressing for legislation for a statue on Capitol grounds honoring General Mihailović. In 1976 and in 1977, the bill was introduced into the Senate by Strom Thurmond and Barry Goldwater. However, the legislation died in the House because of the aforementioned U.S. policy towards Yugoslavia. It was reintroduced <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> decades <b>several</b> times, but failed each time.|$|R
50|$|On the Great Genealogical Tree, {{the oldest}} visual {{presentation}} from 1668, the facility had three floors, and its basic dimensions could already be discerned. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> period, <b>several</b> defense facilities were added around it.
