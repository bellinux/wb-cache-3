5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the eastern Pacific on July17. Tracking west-northwest, the system acquired enough <b>organization</b> <b>to</b> be upgraded to a tropical depression at 0000UTC on July22, while positioned 460mi (740km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Following formation, moderate northeasterly shear inhibited significant development, causing {{the system to}} remain a tropical depression for 48 hours. A mid-level ridge over Mexico caused the system to turn northwest as shear began to decrease; at 0000UTC on July24, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dalila. After attaining its peak intensity with winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 995mb (hPa; 29.39inHg) a day later, the storm tracked over progressively cool waters, causing it to weaken. At 0600UTC on July27, Dalila weakened to a tropical storm, and by 1800UTC, the system no longer retained enough <b>organization</b> <b>to</b> be considered a tropical cyclone.

In March 2011, the chapter sent a delegation to Adultcon at the Los Angeles Convention Center, where Scher and Brown spoke with conference attendees and offered them prayer. That July, Veitch resigned from JC's Girls so she could {{spend more time with}} her family, handing the leadership of the <b>organization</b> <b>to</b> Scher and Brown. In June 2012, Scher gave up her co-leadership of the <b>organization</b> <b>to</b> focus on her family, leaving the leadership to Brown. By 2013, the organization had established guidelines regulating the transition of women from the sex industry into participation in the evangelistic activities of JC's Girls. The woman must consistently attend a Bible study for four months, read Francine Rivers' book Redeeming Love, and be interviewed by the chapter's leaders, who then decide whether the woman should join the organization's outreach team. These guidelines were established because some women who had quickly gone from working in the sex industry to evangelizing with JC's Girls soon left the organization and returned to the sex industry. Brown left JC's Girls in April 2014 and Laura Bonde took over leadership of the organization.|$|E
