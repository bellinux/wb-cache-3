5000|$|The {{woman was}} made <b>of</b> a rib <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the side of}} Adam; not made <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head to rule over him, nor <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> feet to be trampled upon by him, but <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> side to be equal with him, under his arm to be protected, and near his heart to be beloved.|$|R
50|$|Dartalon (formerly Dartalg) - now {{changed into}} an almost monstrous form, with quills coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand like talons instead <b>of</b> <b>his</b> simply {{using them as}} weapons.|$|R
60|$|He crept <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the hole}} and then just lay down and panted for breath. He was almost too tired to move. Then he began to spit sand <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth and blow it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> nose and try to wipe it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> eyes. The long hair <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fine coat was filled full of sand {{and no one would}} ever have guessed that this was Reddy Fox.|$|R
60|$|In {{a moment}} he was all servility. The sneer passed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face, the arrogance <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> demeanour. He became as full of smiles and capers as the meanest sycophant.|$|R
60|$|And jealousy, {{stronger}} than all except fear, wore Neale <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> exaltation, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dream, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> old disposition to work. He could persist in courage {{if not in}} joy. But jealous longing would destroy him--he felt that. It was so powerful, so wonderful that it brought back to him words and movements which until then he {{had been unable to}} recall.|$|R
60|$|After he had gone, Jacob {{began taking}} pennies <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> purse and pennies <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> purse, {{until he had}} more than a hatful--hui! I would like to have such a purse as that.|$|R

60|$|Presently I {{turned and}} frankly met his gaze. I had startled him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{habitual}} set taciturnity, {{but even as}} I looked the light {{that might have been}} amaze and joy faded <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face, leaving it the same old mask.|$|R
60|$|As {{he walked}} back to his seat, the exultant light went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> eyes, his limbs relaxed, the windows and the {{sunlight}} cleared to vulgar day, and his face flushed with timidity.
