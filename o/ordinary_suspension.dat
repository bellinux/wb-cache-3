The others used <b>ordinary</b> <b>suspension.</b> Sometimes a shaft drive was provided on some models, however most Lambert automobile models were with a chain drive to the rear axle.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Inerter is {{a recent}} element in {{suspension}} systems with the property that the generated force {{is proportional to the}} relative acceleration between its two terminals, which is similar to the way a spring reacts to relative displacement and a damper to relative velocity. This paper presents the analysis of a non-linear inerter working in parallel to passive spring and damper of a vehicle suspension to evaluate its effect on vehicle’s ride. The non-linear inerter was theoretically capable of switching between on and off states depending on whether or not the suspension deflection was beyond a specified free play. In the study, this behavior was represented mathematically as control law which depended on the relative displacement between the sprung and unsprung masses. A mathematical quarter vehicle model incorporating the non-linear inerter was simulated in MATLAB/Simulink to determine the vehicle responses due to road input in the form of step profile for different combinations of free play and inerter’s on-state proportionality constant called the inertance. Results showed improvements in vehicle ride comfort, as demonstrated by the lower root-mean-squared sprung mass accelerations compared to the <b>ordinary</b> passive <b>suspension</b> with only spring and damper. Additionally, implementation of non-linear inerter gave lower percentage overshoot to step input, indicating better transient response than <b>ordinary</b> passive <b>suspension...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{pronounced}} {{resistance to}} the x-rays manifested by the papilloma virus in <b>ordinary</b> <b>suspensions</b> {{is due to the}} protecting influence of extraneous matter and also in considerable degree to the amount of virus present in the preparation. Two to 4 million r were required to inactivate the virus contained in the crude papilloma extracts prepared for the present work, whereas 100, 000 r or less was enough to inactivate comparable concentrations of virus after extraneous matter had been excluded by repeated differential centrifugation. The addition of normal rabbit serum or crystalline egg albumin to purified suspensions of virus was found to increase greatly the amount of irradiation required to inactivate the virus. Furthermore the percentage destruction of virus by a given amount of irradiation increases as the concentration is decreased by dilution with saline or buffer solutions. As little as 3, 000 r will inactivate much of the virus in very dilute suspensions. The complement-binding antigen of papilloma virus suspensions is also inactivated by x-rays, but requires a somewhat larger amount of irradiation than necessary to destroy the infectivity of the suspensions. The effects of irradiation on the antiviral antibody present in the blood of animals which have become immune to the virus—an antibody that specifically fixes complement in mixture with the papilloma virus—are also conditioned by extraneous material. 250, 000 to 500, 000 r had only a slight effect on the antibody in whole serum, while this amount of irradiation completely inactivated comparable amounts of antibody in preparations partially purified by precipitation with ammonium sulfate. As a whole the findings indicate that under certain conditions of purity and concentration most of the radiation does not act by direct hits on virus or antibody particles, but indirectly by ionizing or exciting some other molecules present in the exposed suspension, which then react with the virus or antibody molecules...|$|R

The clearcut aim of designing a therapeutic system is to attain a desirable concentration of a drug at the active site for the relevant duration. A successful design of a drugdelivery system, therefore, desires an integrated knowledge of the drug molecule and the restrictions offered by the ocular route of administration. In last decade, {{with the emergence of}} miscellaneous powerful and multifaceted medicinal substitutes, the assortment of traditional ophthalmic preparations has progressively developed; drawing out considerably apart from <b>ordinary</b> solutions, <b>suspensions</b> and ointments, presently comprises a diversity of drug administration formats. Present communication echoes miscellaneous barriers and successive blossoms in the field of ocular therapeutics...|$|R

5000|$|He {{was fond}} of pubs and beer, and both his {{architectural}} guides and television journalism are full of descriptions of pubs, and recommendations of which beers to drink. He said in 1972 of a recently disused signal box in Longtown, Cumbria, that he could imagine it being turned into a house, with the lever frames left in place and converted to beer pumps. This {{was part of his}} love of local and regional distinctiveness, the [...] "ordinary" [...] places which attracted him as much as the locations of noteworthy buildings. In Nairn's Paris, for example, he lovingly describes the village of Quevauvillers, near Amiens, whose few features are [...] "all lying around waiting for nothing to happen". In a similar vein, {{in the small town of}} Prėcy-sur-Oise near Beauvais, he notes [...] "a collection of <b>ordinary</b> things ('wobbly <b>suspension</b> bridge...grain silo...a sign saying Ruberoid') transformed into uniqueness".(The reissued 2017 edition of Nairn's Paris omits these descriptions which appear in the chapters describing buildings in the wider Ile-de-France area such as Chartres, Reims and Beauvais Cathedrals, the abbey church of Saint Martin des Bois, the town of Provins, several châteaux, and numerous hamlets and villages which Nairn deemed to be noteworthy, often, as in the case of Quevauvillers, because of their - for him - charming ordinariness).|$|R
