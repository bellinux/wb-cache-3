40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{institutional sectors}} of the Czech economy since 2000 {{with respect to the}} year 2009 when impacts of economic crisis were felt. It is an empirical analysis based on data of the national accounts. The sense was to show the different influence of this crisis on the sector of nonfinancial corporations, sector offinancial institutions, government sector and household sector. Initially, the economic crisis hit significantly mainly nonfinancial corporations in sphere of their performance but with little impact on profitability. Sector of financial institutions found in deficit itself in 2009 due to adverse development of interest balance and hugeoutflow of dividends, as well. The result in the household sector was reinforced by changes in redistribution processes both received benefits and paid payments. Received wages and salaries in household sector stagnated. Government sector was hit very significantly by crisis when its deficit doubled in 2009. From a broaderperspective the global financial and economic crisis brought for statistics and analyses also a need to watch not <b>only</b> <b>total</b> figures for <b>economy</b> but also an emphasis on the detailed view on the institutional sectors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a {{thorough}} discussion of the definitional and data issues associated with the measurement of aggregate labour productivity growth in Canada and the United States. The paper examines all data sources for output, employment and hours estimates in the two countries, and attempts to identify the series that are the most appropriate for the calculation of aggregate labour productivity ?both from the perspective of the methodological merits of each series and of cross-country comparability. It also assesses the sensitivity of Canada-U. S. aggregate labour productivity growth comparisons to the choice of monitoring trends at the <b>total</b> <b>economy</b> or business sector level, investigates the sources of the differences between trends and comparisons assessed at each level, and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of making comparisons at each level. The paper finds compelling reasons to believe that the monitoring of <b>total</b> <b>economy</b> productivity trends is desirable in addition to the more common practice of focusing on the business sector. Canada has lagged the United States in terms of aggregate labour productivity growth over 1981 - 2003 to a much smaller degree according to <b>total</b> <b>economy</b> trends than according to business sector trends. This is caused by very high measured labour productivity growth in the non-business sector in Canada relative to the United States, which calls into question the reliability of productivity growth comparisons made at the <b>total</b> <b>economy</b> level. This also raises questions about the comparability of GDP growth between the two countries.

30|$|The section {{develops}} {{an economic}} growth model {{that includes the}} Cultural Factor. First, I assume that the <b>total</b> <b>economy</b> (indigenous and non-indigenous) can be represented as an AK model (with human and physical capital). When the weight of Z is small, the economic growth of indigenous communities (and the <b>total</b> <b>economy)</b> can also be characterized as following an AK model, as the factors that keep these communities economically poor could be exogenous, such as lack of opportunities, discrimination and so forth. However, when the weight of Z is large, the Cultural Factor influences economic behavior; thus, the economies of indigenous communities could be characterized as following a Neoclassical model, with economic growth tending toward zero. In this case, the factors that keep these communities in economic poverty are both endogenous (like the Cultural Factor) and exogenous. In this section, we analyze how Neoclassical economies can be expanded into AK model economies.|$|R
40|$|In this introduction, Andrew Sharpe {{provides}} {{the context for}} the Symposium on Future Productivity Growth in Canada, a panel organized by the CSLS at the Canadian Economics Association Meetings, June 2003 at Carleton University. He provides a context for the presentations by highlighting certain {{issues related to the}} topic not directly addressed in the symposium. Total hours worked is a more accurate measure of labour input than persons employed, so that when data on hours are available, an hours-based aggregate labour productivity measure is preferable to a worker-based measure. An important reason for choosing the <b>total</b> <b>economy</b> as the appropriate measure of aggregate labour productivity is that the potential for real income gains is determined by economy-wide aggregate productivity increases, but the business sector accounts for only around three quarters of <b>total</b> <b>economy</b> output. Small increases in productivity over long time periods and the real income gains these generate have extremely favourable consequences for the affordability of social programs. Finally, while the contributors to the symposium reach a consensus of 2 per cent per year labour productivity growth in Canada over the next 25 years, there is no such consensus in the broader economics profession, with some forecasters alternatively predicting labour productivity growth as low as 1. 6 per cent per year.

The {{economic}} theory of clubs can offer eminent contributions to an efficient shaping of processes of integration, especially {{at the level of}} the European Union. To determine a welfare maximum in a world full of clubs, the distinction between the within-club point of view and the <b>total</b> <b>economy</b> point of view plays a decisive role. The article tackles this conflict in already existing clubs realizing their optimal size in connection with the principleagent- problem between club members and club managers. Including the indivisibility problem of individuals and clubs in a more realistic perspective leads to a further problem typical for welfare maximization in a world full of full (i. e. optimally sized) clubs: the situation of those who will not be provided with the club goods. Three possible options taking care of those unprovisioned are distinguished, and it is analyzed how these options affect individual and social net benefit. It is shown that the efficiency of these options decisively depends on the within-club or <b>total</b> <b>economy</b> perspective implying specific principal-agent-problems.
