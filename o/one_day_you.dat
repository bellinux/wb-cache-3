500|$|Douglas Wolfe from TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode 4.8/5 {{and said that}} he did not think the episode could have been {{executed}} better. Wolfe emphasized Ziva's back story with her father and speculated that many of her choices were based upon events that her family experienced, including her father's repeated absences and the breakup of her parents' marriage due to Eli's indiscretions with a young Orli Elbaz, which also explained Ziva's resentment of Elbaz. [...] Wolfe was touched by Ziva's dance with Tony, and her flashback to dancing with her father as a child while he tells her, [...] "My Ziva. <b>One</b> <b>day</b> <b>you</b> will dance with a man who deserves your love". In a TV Fanatic round table, Steve Marsi added, [...] "What an emotionally loaded quote from the Eli flashback, followed by the much-anticipated present-day dance." [...] He {{went on to say that}} Sirtis did well as the new Mossad director and that [...] "Counselor Deanna Troi was nothing but a faint memory". Michelle Calbert from TV Equals praised the storyline and agreed that Marina Sirtis performed well in the role, saying that she found Orli to be a more likeable character than Eli David.|$|E

2500|$|Xue Rengao {{was said}} to be strong and capable at horseriding and archery, and his army {{respected}} him, believing that he was capable of standing up to 10,000 men on his own. [...] However, he was also said to be greedy and cruel. [...] For example, when he captured Yu Li (庾立), the son of the Sui official Yu Xin (庾信), angry that Yu Li dared to resist, he hung Yu on the fire and grilled him, and while doing so, cut his limbs off one by one and cut off his flesh to have his soldiers consume it. [...] When he captured Tianshui, he gathered all the rich men and hung them upside down, pouring vinegar into their nostrils to force them to surrender their treasure. [...] Xue Ju often warned him, [...] "You are capable of great things, but you are strict and cruel, with no grace to others. <b>One</b> <b>day</b> <b>you</b> will surely destroy the state I established and our clan." ...|$|E
2500|$|In fall 617, Xue Ju {{claimed the}} title of Emperor of Qin. [...] He created his wife Lady Ju empress, and he created Xue Rengao crown prince. [...] Xue Rengao {{subsequently}} captured Tianshui, and Xue Ju moved his capital to Tianshui. [...] As Xue Rengao was fierce but often overly cruel to those he captured, Xue Ju often warned him, [...] "You are capable of great things, but you are strict and cruel, with no grace to others. [...] <b>One</b> <b>day</b> <b>you</b> will surely destroy the state I established and our clan." [...] According to traditional historical accounts, however, Xue Ju himself was also cruel, often killing soldiers he captured, and also often cut off their tongues and noses, and therefore did not gain as much following as he hoped. [...] When he sent Xue Renyue south to try to capture lands in modern Sichuan, Xue Renyue was blocked by Xiao Yu the governor of Hechi Commandery (河池, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) and unable to advance. [...] He also sent his general Chang Zhongxing (常仲興) west of the Yellow River to attack Li Gui, who had by then seized the territory west of the Yellow River. [...] Chang, however, was defeated by Li Gui's general Li Yun (李贇), and the entire army was captured by Li Gui, although Li Gui released them back to Xue Ju.|$|E
