25|$|An unusual feeding {{strategy}} {{is that of}} the oxpeckers of Africa. They perch on living animals and glean parasites from the animals' hides. On furry animals, such as buffalo, giraffe, and donkey, these birds run their bills through the fur of the animal, using a scissors-like motion to extract ticks and lice from near the skin. When they pull the insect out {{to the end of the}} fur, they catch it and eat it. (On animals with bare hides, such as rhinoceros and hippopotamus, oxpeckers pick at any open wounds the animals happen to have, consuming blood and pus, and possibly keeping the wounds free of maggots.) Historically, rhinoceros and other large wild mammals have been among the favored hosts, but as the populations of large mammals in the African savanna have declined in modern times, the population and range of both red-billed and yellow-billed <b>oxpecker</b> have also changed, and now the birds will use donkeys and domestic cattle as hosts.|$|E

5|$|Impala are symbiotically {{related to}} <b>oxpeckers,</b> which feed on ticks from {{those parts of}} the antelope's body which the animal cannot access by itself (such as the ears, neck, eyelids, {{forehead}} and underbelly). The impala is the smallest ungulate with which <b>oxpeckers</b> are associated. In a study it was observed that <b>oxpeckers</b> selectively attended to impala despite the presence of other animals such as Coke's hartebeest, Grant's gazelle, Thompson's gazelle and topi. A possible explanation for this could be that because the impala inhabits woodlands (which can have a high density of ticks), the impala could have greater mass of ticks per unit area of the body surface. Another study showed that the <b>oxpeckers</b> prefer the ears over other parts of the body, probably because these parts show maximum tick infestation.|$|R
40|$|<b>Oxpeckers</b> reduce tick loads on {{ungulate}} hosts, {{but they}} are also known to feed on and exacerbate wounds. An understanding of the feeding behaviours and host preferences of these birds is important since they serve as agents of tick control on both domestic and wild ungulates. We conducted an observational study at two sites within the Kruger National Park in South Africa, exploring the feeding preferences of both Red-billed and Yellow-billed <b>Oxpeckers.</b> Oxpeckers’ host preferences, body-location preferences on different hosts, prevalence of feeding and non-feeding behaviours, and frequency of tolerance versus rejection in different hosts were determined. It was found that Yellow-billed <b>Oxpeckers</b> had a smaller range of hosts – typically larger-sized ungulates – and that Red-billed <b>Oxpeckers</b> diversify to smallersized ungulate hosts when in competition with Yellow-billed <b>Oxpeckers.</b> Body-location preferences were generally consistent across sites and across host species. Tick feeding and other host-feeding behaviours (around the eyes, nose, mouth and ears, and anogenital areas) were fairly common. Only six incidents of wound feeding, from a total of 855 observations, were recorded. Tolerance by an ungulate host species was not related to Oxpeckers’ host preferences, suggesting that other factors such as ungulate body size, tick species and tick stages on the host animal may {{play a significant role in}} the feeding preferences of <b>Oxpeckers.</b> Conservation implications: It is important to study Oxpeckers’ behavioural feeding preferences so as to better understand their ecology and present distribution, and to determine where they can be reintroduced in future. Reintroduction not only helps with the proliferation of <b>Oxpeckers,</b> but also benefits ungulate hosts through ectoparasite removal and the subsequent control of tick-borne diseases. </p...|$|R
50|$|<b>Oxpeckers</b> are morphologically {{somewhat}} similar to starlings due to shared plesiomorphies, but are uniquely adapted {{to feed on}} parasites and blood of large land mammals, which has always obscured their relationships. This lineage forms part of a radiation that includes Sturnidae and Mimidae, but {{appears to be the}} most ancient of these groups. Biogeography strongly suggests that <b>oxpeckers</b> originated in eastern Asia and only later arrived in Africa, where they now have a relict distribution.|$|R

50|$|The <b>oxpeckers</b> are {{two species}} of bird which make up the family Buphagidae. Some ornithologists regard them as a {{subfamily}} Buphaginae within the starling family, Sturnidae, but {{they appear to be}} quite distinct. <b>Oxpeckers</b> are endemic to the savanna of Sub-Saharan Africa. Both the English and scientific names arise from their habit of perching on large mammals (both wild and domesticated) such as cattle, zebras, impalas, hippopotamuses, or rhinoceroses, and eating ticks, small insects, botfly larvae, and other parasites.|$|R

25|$|The <b>oxpeckers</b> are {{sometimes}} placed {{here as a}} subfamily, but the weight of evidence has shifted towards granting them full family status as a more basal member of the Sturnidae-Mimidae group, derived from an early expansion into Africa.|$|R
5000|$|However, their {{preferred}} food is blood, {{and while they}} may take ticks bloated with blood, they also feed on it directly, pecking at the mammal's wounds until blood flows. [...] Whatever the net result, mammals generally tolerate <b>oxpeckers.</b>|$|R

50|$|The red-billed <b>oxpecker</b> (Buphagus erythrorhynchus) is a {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} starling and myna family, Sturnidae; some ornithologists {{regard the}} oxpeckers {{to be in a}} family by themselves, the Buphagidae. It is native to the savannah of sub-Saharan Africa, from the Central African Republic east to South Sudan and south to northern and eastern South Africa. Its range overlaps that of the less widespread yellow-billed <b>oxpecker.</b>|$|E
50|$|The yellow-billed <b>oxpecker</b> (Buphagus africanus) is a {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} starling and myna family, Sturnidae; some ornithologists {{regard the}} oxpeckers to be a separate family, the Buphagidae (Zuccon, 2006). It is native to the savannah of Sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal east to Sudan. It is least common in the extreme east of its range where it overlaps with the red-billed <b>oxpecker,</b> despite always dominating that species when feeding.|$|E
50|$|In rural areas, red-winged {{starlings}} {{are often}} spotted perching on livestock and game, such as cattle, klipspringers and giraffes, a trait {{shared by the}} pale-winged starling, and may take insects and ectoparasites such as ticks, much {{in the manner of}} <b>oxpeckers.</b>|$|R

50|$|Their thick-layered skin {{helps to}} protect the rhino from thorns and sharp grasses. Their skin harbors {{external}} parasites, such as mites and ticks, which may be eaten by <b>oxpeckers</b> and egrets. Such behaviour was originally thought to {{be an example of}} mutualism, but recent evidence suggests that <b>oxpeckers</b> may be parasites instead, feeding on rhino blood. It is commonly assumed that black rhinos have poor eyesight, relying more on hearing and smell. However, studies have shown that their eyesight is comparatively good, at about the level of a rabbit. Their ears have a relatively wide rotational range to detect sounds. An excellent sense of smell alerts rhinos to the presence of predators.|$|R

50|$|Some living fossils are relicts of {{formerly}} {{diverse and}} morphologically varied lineages, but {{the criteria for}} assigning living fossil status being so arbitrary, not all survivors of ancient lineages necessarily are regarded as living fossils.

50|$|Phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{have shown}} that mimids are most closely related to starlings.

This is evidenced by the Asian-SW Pacific distribution of the most basal starlings (and Philippine creepers) and the North American range of the basal mimids.|$|R
