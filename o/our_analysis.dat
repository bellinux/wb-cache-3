By <b>our</b> <b>analysis,</b> we find that 5 pints of the atmosphere contain only 1 pint of oxygen, and 4 pints, or 4 parts, of nitrogen by bulk. That is <b>our</b> <b>analysis</b> of the atmosphere. It requires all that quantity of nitrogen to reduce the oxygen down, {{so as to be}} able to supply the candle properly with fuel, so as to supply us with an atmosphere which our lungs can healthily and safely breathe; for it is just as important to make the oxygen right for us to breathe, as it is to make the atmosphere right for the burning of the fire and the candle.|$|E

60|$|Nearly all {{contemporary}} thinkers {{who are not}} too muddled to be assignable {{fall into}} one of three classes, of which the third we shall distinguish is the largest and most various and divergent.

60|$|Enough has, I hope, {{been said}} {{to show that}} {{consciousness}} is far too complex and accidental to be taken as the fundamental characteristic of mind.

Therefore, if any definition of mind is suggested by <b>our</b> <b>analysis</b> of consciousness, images are what would naturally suggest themselves. But since we found that images can only be defined causally, we cannot deal with this suggestion, except in connection with the difference between physical and psychological causal laws.|$|E

For other forms of belief-feeling or of content, we have only to make the necessary substitutions in this analysis.|$|E
