Two techniques measured holistic processing {{in isolation from}} part-based contributions to face perception: salience bias to upright in transparency displays, and a difficult-to-see Mooney face. Results revealed an asymmetric inverted-U-shaped tuning to simulated <b>observer-target</b> <b>distance</b> (stimulus size and viewer-screen distance combinations). Holistic processing peaked at distances functionally relevant for identification during approach (2 – 10 m; equivalent head size= 6 – 1. 3 °), fell off steeply at closer distances functionally relevant for understanding emotional nuances and speech (. 25 – 2 m), and operated over a very wide range of distances (from. 46 to 23 m, 47. 5 – 0. 6 °) ...|$|E
