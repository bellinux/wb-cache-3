On 29 May 2007, H&L's Lawrence Abramson sent the final draft of a letter whose text had negotiated between the law firm and its client to News International, stating that the review of the e-mails had found no such evidence. In his testimony to the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee on 19 July 2011, News International's James Murdoch claimed to have relied on this letter containing [...] "outside legal advice from senior counsel” to publicly maintain that the phone hacking had been the work of a single [...] "rogue reporter," [...] namely Goodman.
