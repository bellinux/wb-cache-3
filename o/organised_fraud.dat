2500|$|In France, several {{officials}} of the Church of Scientology were convicted of embezzlement in 2001. The Church was listed as a [...] "dangerous cult" [...] in a parliamentary report. In May 2009 a trial commenced in France against Scientology, accusing it of <b>organised</b> <b>fraud.</b> The case focused on a complaint {{by a woman who}} says that after being offered a free personality test, she was pressured into paying large sums of money. The church is regarded as a sect in France. The result of the trial was that two branches of the organization and several of its leaders have been found guilty of fraud and fined. Alain Rosenberg, the group's head in France, received a two-year suspended jail sentence.|$|E
40|$|The European Union’s VAT {{system has}} become {{vulnerable}} to <b>organised</b> <b>fraud</b> schemes. In recent years, these schemes, undergoing {{a change in}} structure, have affected services and imports of {{goods from third countries}} and may also have shifted trade in goods among EU countries. Within the EU- 27, organised VAT fraud is estimated to amount to between € 20 billion and € 35 billion a year. The EU institutions and Member States have put forward several measures to tackle this problem, although some of these have placed a disproportionate burden on businesses. The article shows that need to maximise the effectiveness of anti-VAT-fraud strategy cannot be separated from a broad view of the problem and of the functioning of the VAT system as a whole. A drastic change in the VAT system might provide a robust defence against fraud but produce uncertain effects. Enhancing risk management and exchange of good practices is essential. Technology-based solutions appear to be a pragmatic and politically feasible approach to new challenges, with good prospects of success. VAT, tax evasion, fraud...|$|E

The insights contained in this report {{are based on the}} consolidation of open source information which is informed by intelligence collected under Task Force Galilee. Serious and <b>Organised</b> Investment <b>Fraud</b> involves the solicitation of investment in non-existent or essentially worthless shares and other securities.  As found in 2002, Australia continues to be recognised as an attractive location for Serious and <b>Organised</b> Investment <b>Fraud</b> operations. This is attributed to the continuing strength of Australia’s economy, the overall level of wealth of individuals and interest in investing as well as the high level of superannuation and retirement savings that Australians can access for investing...|$|R

Nevzlin, who is charged by Russian prosecutors with having <b>organised</b> killings, <b>fraud</b> and tax evasion (all these charges are widely believed), claimed Litvinenko's inquiries may have provided a motive for his poisoning.|$|R

50|$|Following McGurk's death, {{an unnamed}} criminal, aged 73, prosecuted for fraud and in custody {{at the time}} of McGurk's death, alleges that he was kidnapped and {{tortured}} by associates of McGurk because he was trying to leave a gang that was undertaking systemic and <b>organised</b> superannuation <b>fraud.</b> Apparently police were aware of the alleged fraud scheme (operating between 2003 and 2005) and grossed in excess of $2M for McGurk; but were unable to obtain a clear link to prove McGurk was involved, despite the man making the allegations living in a property owned by McGurk, in Orlando Avenue, Cremorne.|$|R
5000|$|James Sadleir was Chairman, Managing Director and {{a public}} agent of the bank, and on 29 February the first {{creditor}} sued him to recover £2,827 15s. 4d. It was recognised that he would inevitably {{bear the brunt of}} the failure, and The Times reported that there was [...] "a wide-spread feeling of pity" [...] for him as he was already a ruined man. Other creditors of the bank rushed to try to recover their money from him. An early judgment absolved the managers of the bank of responsibility, but was soon reversed. The court inquiries disclosed letters written from John to James which implicated him in <b>organising</b> the <b>frauds.</b> However, Sadleir absconded on 17 June. Questions were asked why no criminal charges had been brought against him by this stage, any previous sympathy for his position having disappeared. Charges were brought on 18 July.|$|R
50|$|Several {{agencies}} enforce New Zealand criminal law, {{although the}} New Zealand Police {{is the national}} agency responsible for enforcing criminal and traffic law, enhancing public safety, maintaining order and keeping the peace throughout New Zealand. The Police frequently co-operate with other enforcement agencies both {{on a case by}} case basis and also through multi-agency taskforces targeted at Organised and Transnational Crime. Fisheries, Immigration, <b>Organised</b> Crime, Serious <b>Fraud,</b> Aviation and Border Security all have dedicated enforcement agencies. In addition to Police, road controlling authorities, such as local city or district councils, have the power to enforce their own parking by-laws.|$|R

Rainsy and Poch, both facing possible charges of criminal defamation, left the country. Cheam did not leave, and was arrested later the same day by military police. He was charged by the Cambodian Military Court with the criminal offences of <b>Organised</b> Crime and <b>Fraud,</b> as well as a military charge of disobeying orders. These charges relate to accusations that Cheam had created an illegal army for the SRP. Cheam appealed by letter to Prince Norodom Ranariddh, but the prince responded that he could not intervene in judicial matters.|$|R
40|$|First made {{available}} online on 12 January 2016. The {{development of the}} Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ) within the European Union (EU) has followed a remarkably capricious pattern. As a relatively new policy domain within the EU, it has been approached with caution and suspicion by politicians in the member States, who have implicitly or explicitly expressed resentment at relinquishing national control in sovereigntywsensitive areas, such as immigration and asylum control, police and judicial co-operation, and the fight against transnational <b>organised</b> crime, <b>fraud</b> and corruption. On the other hand, national politicians have embraced {{the construction of the}} AFSJ as an opportunity to turn the EU into a joint internal security enterprise which should bring the EU closer to the citizens of Europe. The latter approach has emerged particularly since the special Council Summit which was convened in Tampere during the Finnish Presidency and which was solely developed to Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) cooperation. The institutionalisation trend which was reinforced at the Tampere summit - particularly through the endorsement of the creation of Eurojust and the European Police College - has however been fettered by nested games and bargaining processes...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} relationship between some features of the American criminal justice system and the infiltration of organised crime groups into New York's financial district to commit securities fraud. The primary focus {{of the study is}} to determine if and to what extent the present criminal justice strategies designed to counter organised crime activities have {{had an impact on the}} entry of New York's five Italian-American crime families and Russian-origin criminals into the securities market. There are scattered works and articles on <b>organised</b> crime related <b>frauds</b> in the stock market, but there is no thorough empirical study on the movement of organised crime groups from traditional rackets into the securities market in New York. This research was undertaken to remedy the paucity of criminological knowledge on the activities of organised crime groups in the U. S. investment sector and on the factors underlying this. Sensitive and extensive data on major organised crime cases on Wall Street are analysed throughout the work. The study utilised a combination of interviews, existing source documents and written materials. Several interviews were conducted of known organised crime members, enforcement personnel, informants and experts on organised crime. The source documents that were used in this study comprised of public and private domain records from investigating and prosecuting bodies within the criminal justice syste...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{tries to}} put {{together}} a modest study on the actions taken at EU level in order to fight economic crime. A series of measures have been implemented at national and European level to create a framework for fighting criminality. The European institutions and the national authorities are improving their cooperation in order to fight the increasing number of economic crimes committed both in the private and public sector, while Member States are approximating their legislation to the provisions of the Community acquis. We have divided these efforts into five categories corresponding to the five main areas of economic crime identified at EU level: fight against fraud, which affects the financial interests of the European Union and mainly comprises fraudulent practices in the use of EU funds and in taxation, fight against piracy and counterfeiting, public and private corruption, money laundering and organised crime. In order to combat the negative influence criminality exerts {{on the development of the}} economy and of the overall society, for each of the above mentioned areas legislative, institutional, technical and administrative measures have been adopted. We have presented these measures considering their efficiency in meeting the targets set out and the role played in their implementation by the European and national institutions. economic criminality, European cooperation, legislative framework, <b>fraud,</b> <b>organised</b> crime...|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the University of Wolverhampton for the degree of Master of PhilosophyThe law is stated as at July 2006, before the enactment of the United Kingdom Fraud Act 2006. This thesis covers ‘serious’ corporate fraud and not commonplace petty fraud. I examined corporate fraud, concentrating on a comparison of the United Kingdom’s fraud with that of two civil law neighbouring countries, France and Germany, both with high financial activity, and also with a few American states, common law systems like the English legal system. The objective {{of this study is to}} identify ways of combating fraud in the UK by enquiry and discovery as to how fraud occurs and how the two different legal systems- civil and common law- treat fraud. The study reveals factors contributing to corporate fraud and recommendations for combating corporate fraud. Exploring the concept of fraud, my findings are that corporate fraud is facing exponential increase, with the UK government beginning to acknowledge this. I examined the agencies that combat fraud in the states mentioned above including the UK. Although the UK is party to an impressive number of Treaties, which help to combat fraud, treaties dealing with terrorism, drug dealing, money laundering, and other <b>organised</b> crime, corporate <b>fraud</b> is still a serious problem. The conclusions can be summarised as follows. The UK could learn much from the French legal system and the way France prosecutes corporations as per Articles 132, 222, 432, 433 and 435 of the French Penal Code. Germany’s Criminal Code is equally comprehensive in its prescriptive definitions of frauds including corporate frauds as in chapters 8, 19, 2, 23, 24, 25, 26 and 30 of the German Criminal Code. The new UK’s non-codified general, core, offence of fraud, with fraud offences maintained in other statutes such as the Companies Act, likens the UK fraud regulation closer to the US’s with its Criminal Code and other statutes that deal with fraud. The UK has not yet caught up with the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 as regards electronic business systems’ rules. The USA’s federal prescriptive code for fraud offences is akin to the French and German criminal codes and these are found in US Federal Penal Code Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 47, sections 1020 to 1084. Legal privilege is fraud exempt in the United but not in France and Germany. Legal privilege in the UK is partly exempt for SFO investigations and mandatory money laundering reporting...|$|R
