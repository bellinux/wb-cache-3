5|$|The Amarillo Film Commission is a {{division}} of the Amarillo Convention and Visitor Council that was created to provide film crews with locations and other assistance when filming in Amarillo. Amarillo was the setting for many motion pictures, including Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Switchback 1997, and The Plutonium Circus, the 1995 South by Southwest Film Festival winner for best documentary feature. Amarillo was the title of the third episode of the second season of AMC (TV channel)'s drama Better Call Saul, a spin-off <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hit</b> drama Breaking Bad. The city played a part in the plot of the episode, as it was a location used by series protagonist Jimmy McGill to solicit clients.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{score system}} {{is based on}} a {{multiplier}} bar and a hit gauge counter. As the player destroys enemy cores, the hit counter increases. Points awarded for destroyed cores are multiplied by the value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hit</b> counter. The counter decreases when the player stops destroying cores. However, if the multiplier reaches a certain amount it will begin to flash, awarding large point bonuses for any cores destroyed during this short period of time.|$|E
5|$|Floodlights were {{installed}} {{at a cost}} of £12,000 in 1957. On 30 October they were switched on for the first time for a match against Everton to commemorate the 75-year anniversary of the Liverpool County Football Association. In 1963 the old Kemlyn Road stand was replaced by a cantilevered stand, built {{at a cost of}} £350,000, accommodating 6,700 spectators. Two years later alterations were made at the Anfield Road end, turning it into a larger covered standing area with refreshments under the structure. The biggest redevelopment came in 1973, when the old Main Stand was partially demolished and extended backwards with new roof. Simultaneously the concrete pylon floodlights were demolished with new lights installed along the rooflines of the Kemlyn Road and Main Stands. The new stand was officially opened by the Duke of Kent on 10 March 1973. In the 1980s the paddock in front of the Main Stand was turned into seating, and in 1982 seats were introduced at the Anfield Road end. The Shankly Gates were erected in 1982, a tribute to former manager Bill Shankly; his widow Nessie unlocked {{them for the first time}} on 26 August 1982. Across the Shankly Gates are the words You'll Never Walk Alone, the title <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hit</b> song by Gerry and the Pacemakers adopted by Liverpool fans as the club's anthem during Shankly's time as manager.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Kajol {{featured}} in the melodrama Udhaar Ki Zindagi, as the granddaughter of the characters played by Jeetendra and Moushumi Chatterjee. The film, which was a remake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hit</b> Telugu film, Seetharamaiah Gari Manavaralu, failed to do well at the box office. However, Kajol received praise for her performance and won the BFJA Award for Best Actress. She subsequently starred in and earned public recognition with Yash Raj Films's hit romantic drama Yeh Dillagi, alongside Akshay Kumar and Saif Ali Khan. The film, which was an unofficial remake of the Hollywood film Sabrina, narrated {{the story of a}} chauffeur's daughter who becomes a model, and engages in a love triangle between two brothers. The success of Yeh Dillagi proved a breakthrough for Kajol and her performance in the film fetched her a first Best Actress nomination at the annual Filmfare Awards.|$|E

5|$|In the 2008–09 season, Brashear's point total {{dropped to}} four, his lowest total since 1995–96 {{while he was}} with the Montreal Canadiens. During the 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs, he earned a {{suspension}} for two separate on-ice incidents. On April 26, 2009, the Capitals faced the New York Rangers in Game 6 of their first-round series. In the pre-game warm-ups, Brashear shoved Rangers enforcer Colton Orr, then delivered a blind-side hit to Blair Betts mid-way through the game's first period. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hit,</b> and a possible elbow, Betts suffered a broken orbital bone and was out indefinitely. Colin Campbell ruled that the hit was late on an unsuspecting player; he also believed it targeted the head, and as a result caused significant injury. For his actions, Brashear was given a six-game suspension by the League — one for the pre-game altercation and five for the hit on Betts.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Hawks {{returned}} to the screwball comedy genre with His Girl Friday, starring Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. The film was an adaptation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hit</b> Broadway play The Front Page by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, which had already been made into a film in 1931 and had also been reworked by the same screenwriters and transplanted to Rudyard Kipling's India for Gunga Din in 1939. In 1941, Hawks made Sergeant York, starring Gary Cooper as a pacifist farmer who becomes a decorated World War I soldier. This was the highest-grossing film of 1941 and won two Academy Awards (Best Actor and Best Editing), as well as earning Hawks his only nomination for Best Director. Later that year, Hawks worked with Cooper again for Ball of Fire, which also starred Barbara Stanwyck. The film was written by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett and is a playful take on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Cooper plays a sheltered, intellectual linguist who is writing an encyclopedia with six other scientists, and hires street-wise Stanwyck {{to help them with}} modern slang terms. In 1941, Hawks began work on the Howard Hughes-produced (and later directed) film The Outlaw, based on the life of Billy the Kid and starring Jane Russell. Hawks completed initial shooting of the film in early 1941, but due to perfectionism and battles with the Hollywood Production Code, Hughes continued to re-shoot and re-edit the film until 1943, when it was finally released with Hawks uncredited as director.|$|E
5|$|The Whiskers are a {{successful}} group of meerkats that own a two-square-mile {{area in the}} Kuruman River Reserve. The group came into existence in 1998, with four Young Ones females and two Lazuli rovers - reinforced with a wild meerkat who had been released nearby (instead of the potjie) from Van Zylsrus. Holly and Argon took dominance till 2000. After Holly died Risca took dominance with Beetle. She evicted some females who formed the Asphodel and Hobgoblin groups. Eleven Vivian rovers emigrated into Whiskers in 2001. Izit won dominance over Basil, despite Basil being older. Basil left to join to Lazuli. Risca and Izit lost dominance and left to form the Gattaca. Vialli and Zaphod became the next dominant pair. After Vialli died, Flower won dominance in 2002. Yossarian overthrew Zaphod taking male dominance but Zaphod overthrew him sometime after. Flower and Zaphod reign then on. The group split Yossarian and Super Furry Animal taking dominance in the splinter till Baddiel overthrew her sister. The Whiskers reunited and Flower and Zaphod took back dominance. Flower evicted Kinkaju and Mozart with two other females who formed the Starsky. Flower succumbed to a snake bite in January 2007. Her daughter Rocket Dog rose to power after her. The Whiskers split in two and formed the Aztecs. After Rocket Dog died in 2008 and Ella established dominance. Five Whiskers males emigrated into the Lazuli kicking out Thundercat who soon joined the Whiskers. The group recently recovered after a low in numbers. Many Whiskers formed or joined other groups. Some males have joined the Whiskers rivals the Lazuli and Commandos. While many groups were formed by Whiskers members such as the two largest group in the KMP today, the Baobab and Kung Fu. With every move recorded on camera by Cambridge University, the Whiskers became famous as the stars <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hit</b> television series, Meerkat Manor (2005).|$|E

5|$|As {{the ensuing}} 1996–97 season began, Kariya {{was out of}} the lineup with a pulled {{abdominal}} muscle. After missing the first 11 games of the season, he returned to the lineup at the end of October 1996. Two weeks after his return, however, he was injured again after suffering a concussion during a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs on November 13, 1996, after opposing defenceman Mathieu Schneider hit Kariya in the head with his elbow. While the play was not penalized during the game, Schneider was suspended by the League following the contest. Kariya missed two games as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hit.</b> In the 13 games that he {{was out of the}} Ducks' lineup, the team won one game, lost ten and tied two. Later in the season, Kariya was voted in by fans to the West's starting lineup in the 1997 All-Star Game. Receiving 210,015 votes, he was second among Western Conference wingers to Brett Hull's 254,414. Joining him on the Western squad were Ducks teammates Selänne and Guy Hebert. During the Game, he scored one goal in an 11–7 loss to the East. Returning to club play with the Ducks, he scored the fastest goal to start a game in team history, eight seconds into a match against Colorado on March 9, 1997. The contest ended in a 2–2 tie. Kariya finished the season with 44 goals and 55 assists, one point short of reaching the 100-point mark for the second consecutive year. Limited to 69 games due to his injuries, he still ranked third in League point-scoring, behind Selänne and Pittsburgh Penguins captain Mario Lemieux. His +36 plus-minus rating and ten game-winning goals set Ducks records (the latter mark was tied by Selänne twice in 1997–98 and 2006–07, then broken by Corey Perry's 11 game-winning goals in 2010–11). Nominated for the Hart Memorial Trophy as the League's MVP, alongside Lemieux and Buffalo Sabres goaltender Dominik Hašek, Kariya finished as a runner-up to Hašek. Kariya did, however, win the Lady Byng Award after recording six penalty minutes during the season. In doing so, he became the third player in NHL history to win the award in consecutive years after Mike Bossy (1983 and 1984) and Wayne Gretzky (1991 and 1992). He was also named to the NHL First All-Star Team once more, an honour he shared with Selänne. His efforts helped the Ducks achieve a winning record (36 wins, 33 losses and 13 ties) and reach the playoffs for the first time in team history. Trailing three-games-to-two against the Phoenix Coyotes in the opening round of the 1997 playoffs, the Ducks faced elimination in Game 6 of the series. Kariya scored two goals in the contest, including the overtime-winner, leading the Ducks to a 3–2 win. In the ensuing Game 7, Anaheim won 3–0 to eliminate Phoenix. Facing the (eventual Stanley Cup champions) Detroit Red Wings in the second round, they were swept in four games. Of the four-game series, one went to overtime, one went to double overtime and one went to triple overtime. Playing 11 games in his first NHL playoff season, Kariya had seven goals and 13 points, which ranked first in team scoring.|$|E
