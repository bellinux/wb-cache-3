40|$|Whether {{officials}} {{can be trusted}} to protect national security information has {{become a matter of}} great public controversy, reigniting a long-standing debate about the scope and nature of official secrecy. The declassification of millions of electronic records has made it possible to analyze these issues with greater rigor and precision. Using machine-learning methods, we examined nearly a million State Department cables from the 1970 s to identify features of records that {{are more likely to be}} classified, such as international negotiations, military operations, and high-level communications. Even with incomplete data, algorithms can use such features to identify 90 % of classified cables with < 11 % false positives. But our results also show that there are longstanding problems in the identification of sensitive information. Error analysis reveals many examples of both <b>overclassification</b> and underclassification. This indicates both the need for research on inter-coder reliability among officials as to what constitutes classified material and the opportunity to develop recommender systems to better manage both classification and declassification...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we first examine how host {{nationals}} (i. e., Italians) categorize immigrants; second, we look into the roles played by estimation of size and composition of immigrant population, perceived threat, prejudice, and need for cognitive closure in that process. In {{the first part of}} the study, participants responded to questionnaires measuring the variables just mentioned, including an estimation of which immigrant group was the largest in Italy. In the second part of the study, 96 photographs of male faces from 16 immigrant groups were shown to participants (N = 195). They were asked to identify the country of origin of each person in the photographs. Results showed that perceived threat enhanced the effect of prejudice and need for cognitive closure in the process of ethnic categorization. Individuals with a high need for cognitive closure and prejudice toward ethnic groups classified more immigrants as members of the group estimated as being the largest in their country when they perceived immigrants as a threat. The implications of outgroup <b>overclassification</b> for prejudice against immigrants are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) is an {{important}} modality in terrain and land surveying for many environmental, engineering and civil applications. This paper presents the framework for a recently developed unsupervised classification algorithm called Skewness Balancing for object and ground point separation in airborne LIDAR data. The main advantages of the algorithm are threshold-freedom and independence from LIDAR data format and resolution, while preserving object and terrain details. The framework for Skewness Balancing has been built in this contribution with a prediction model in which unknown LIDAR tiles can be categorised as “hilly” or “moderate” terrains. Accuracy assessment of the model is carried out using cross-validation with an overall accuracy of 95 %. An extension to the algorithm is developed to address the <b>overclassification</b> issue for hilly terrain. For moderate terrain, {{the results show that}} from the classified tiles detached objects (buildings and vegetation) and attached objects (bridges and motorway junctions) are separated from bare earth (ground, roads and yards) which makes Skewness Balancing ideal to be integrated into geographic information system (GIS) software packages...|$|E
40|$|In vivo rabbit {{data for}} skin {{irritation}} {{registered in the}} European New Chemicals Database (NCD) and an ECETOC Database were evaluated to characterise the distribution of irritation potential among chemicals and to assess the variability of the animal test. These databases {{could be used to}} determine experimental and rudimentarily within-laboratory variability, but not between-laboratory variability. Our evaluation suggests that experimental variability is small. Using two classification systems—the system currently used in Europe and the Globally Harmonised System (GHS) —the prevalence of skin irritation data obtained from NCD was analysed. This analysis revealed that out of 3121 chemicals tested, less than 10 % showed an irritation potential in rabbits which would require an appropriate hazard label and 64 % did not cause any irritation. Furthermore, it appears that in practical use the European classification system introduces bias towards <b>overclassification.</b> Based on these findings, we conclude, that the classification systems should be refined taking prevalence into account. Additionally, prevalence should be incorporated into the design and analysis of validation studies for in vitro test methods and in the definition of testing strategies. JRC.

40|$|When data {{is being}} used in a federated database, {{the aim is to}} give a loose {{coupling}} of the data in the component databases so that a very dynamic and therefore flexible pattern of data sharing can be established. When se-curity integration is performed this flexibility is curtailed by the resultant security level es-tablished at integration time which by default is the least upper bound between candidate security levels. Such <b>overclassification</b> of data implies that. there willbe author&d users who are debarred at the federation level to access the data. To circumvent this problem {{there is a need for}} a dynamic mandate type control for definite periods of the federated system’s exk tence. An approach to establishing su:h tem-porary dynamic security control is described in this paper. It is an adaptation of Shamir’s method [Sha 79] for sharing a secret., and it aims to let users who are debarred at the de-fault security level from access to particular data, gain access to this data under local con-trol if an appropriate combination of current, database administrator of the system are pre-pared to grant, the access dynamically.

40|$|Morphological {{variation}} was {{studied in}} 124 accessions from 61 Passiflora L. species. Twenty-four quantitative descriptors selected for their high variation among subgenera were {{submitted to a}} principal component analysis. The first principal component (32 % of total variance) was associated with flower length and secondarily with floral cup constriction, the second (27 %) with flower width and bract shape, and the third (14 %) with peduncle branching, stem width, and leaf length, which relates it to the differentiation of subgenera Astrophea and Deidamioides. The projection of accessions in the resulting tridimensional space consistently separates the four subgenera, as well as supersection Tacsonia of subgenus Passiflora. A neighbor joining analysis, on a selection of 32 qualitative traits and four categorized quantitative variables, clustered species according to their chromosome number and, within subgenus Passiflora, separated supersections Tacsonia (pollinated by the sword-billed hummingbird) and Distephana (pollinated by shorter-billed hummingbirds) from all other, bee-pollinated, species. Thus, the morphological study allows separating the effects of genome evolution from those of more recent and independent coevolutions concerning the pollination syndromes of supersections Tacsonia and Distephana. Within subgenus Decaloba, diverging subclusters are consistent with supersections and particular sections, with the partial exception of supersection Decaloba. Within supersection Tacsonia, subclusters correspond {{to one or two}} sections, pointing to <b>overclassification</b> in the current taxonomy. Among the bee-pollinated species of subgenus Passiflora, only supersection Laurifolia is clearly validated. Most of these results are consistent with molecular phylogenetic studies, except for interspecific relations among bee-pollinated species of subgenus Passiflora, which appear particularly difficult to classify.

40|$|Acute poisonings from {{chemicals}} and products {{continue to be}} a significant public health problem. Development of the Up-and-Down Procedure for acute oral systemic toxicity testing has reduced the number of animals used by 70 % while continuing to provide accurate classification and labeling for human health hazards. U. S. regulatory agencies also require acute dermal systemic toxicity testing for {{chemicals and}} products to estimate their potential to cause life-threatening or fatal toxicity from skin exposures. The resulting estimated lethal dose (LD 50) values are used for acute dermal exposure hazard classification and labeling in order to protect {{human health and the environment}} during the handling, transport, and use of chemicals. With the objective of reducing the number of animals used for acute dermal systemic toxicity testing while maintaining the protection of human health for acute dermal exposures, NICEATM analyzed acute oral systemic toxicity data to determine its usefulness for assigning acute dermal systemic toxicity hazard categories for a wide range of chemicals. LD 50 values were collected for 427 substances that had both acute oral and dermal data. Using oral data to classify dermal toxicity hazard categories underclassified 30 % (126 / 427) and overclassified 34 % (146 / 427) of the substances using the hazard classification categories in the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals. Underclassification of substances is less protective of public health and would fail to appropriately notify material handlers of chemical hazards while <b>overclassification</b> could desensitize them to such hazards. Therefore, acute oral toxicity data should not be used for classifying dermal toxicity hazards because it would underclassify or overclassify a substantial proportion of substances...|$|E
40|$|As {{noted by}} President Obama 2 ̆ 7 s recent Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies, {{pervasive}} state surveillance {{has never been}} more feasible. There has been an inexorable rise in the size and reach of the national security bureaucracy since it was created after World War II, as we have gone through the Cold War and the War on Terror. No one doubts that our national security bureaucracies need to gain intelligence and keep some of it secret. But the consensus of decades of experts, both insiders and outsiders, is that there is rampant overclassfication by government agencies. From its inception in 1966, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has presumed disclosure. And from its inception, Congress intended the federal courts to act as a brake on unfettered agency discretion regarding classification. But courts have not played a strong role in this regard. This Article examines the interplay of overclassfication, excessive judicial deference, and illusory agency expertise {{in the context of the}} national security exemption to the FOIA. The national security exemption allows documents to be withheld that are 2 ̆ 2 specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy 2 ̆ 2 and that 2 ̆ 2 are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order. 2 ̆ 2 The history of national security classification and the passage of the FOIA illuminate the tension between legislative demands for transparency and the growth of the national security state with its agency culture of secrecy. That tension has generally been resolved by the courts in favor of secrecy, despite agreement that there is rampant <b>overclassification</b> and pseudo classification (labeling documents as sensitive but unclassified). This deference in turn leads agencies routinely to deny FOIA requests that should in fact be granted. Without adequate court oversight, there is no agency incentive to comply with the FOIA 2 ̆ 7 s presumption of disclosure. We argue that courts have been systematically ignoring their clear legislative mandate. Although the government is entitled to substantial deference, the role of the judiciary is not to rubber stamp claims of national security, but to undertake de novo and in camera review of government claims that the information requested was both required to be kept secret and properly classified. Congress amended the FOIA in 1974 to make this requirement explicit, overruling a judicial attempt to defer completely to government claims that national security classifications are proper. There are many reasons that courts are reluctant to get involved in determining the validity of exemption claims based on national security. Overestimation of risk may be one reason, as is fear of the consequences of error. We also discuss a 2 ̆ 2 secrecy heuristic 2 ̆ 2 whereby people attribute greater accuracy to 2 ̆ 2 secret 2 ̆ 2 documents. Notwithstanding these rationales, courts have, in other contexts, wrestled successfully with the conflict between national security and paramount rights, such as those found in the First and Fourth Amendments. Courts have the institutional expertise to review claims of national security, if they choose to exercise it. Our conclusion is that the systematic failures of the federal courts in the FOIA context are neither inevitable nor justified. We show that courts do occasionally order the release of some documents. This Article includes the first empirical investigation into the decisionmaking of the D. C. district courts and federal circuit courts in cases involving the national security exemption to determine what, if any, factors favor document release. We find that party characteristics are the biggest predictor of disclosure. We also show that, while politics do not seem to matter at most courts, they do at the D. C. Circuit Court of Appeals, at which Republican dominated panels have never ordered disclosure...|$|E
