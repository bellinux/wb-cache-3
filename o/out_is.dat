The album {{was produced by}} John Goodmanson and recorded from December 1996 to January 1997 at John and Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington. Dig Me Out marked the debut of Janet Weiss, who is the band's longest serving and current drummer. The music on the record was influenced by traditional rock and roll bands, while the lyrics deal with issues of heartbreak and survival. The album cover is an homage to The Kinks' 1965 album The Kink Kontroversy.|$|E

5|$|If {{the temple}} is small it {{will consist of}} only a closed mantapa (enclosed with walls {{extending}} {{all the way to}} the ceiling) and the shrine. The closed mantapa, well decorated inside and <b>out,</b> <b>is</b> larger than the vestibule connecting the shrine and the mantapa and has four lathe-turned pillars to support the ceiling, which may be deeply domed. The four pillars divide the hall into nine bays. The nine bays result in nine decorated ceilings. Pierced stone screens (Jali or Latticework) that serve as windows in the navaranga (hall) and Sabhamantapa (congregation hall) is a characteristic Hoysala stylistic element.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} to record two outs {{in the course of}} the same play. This is called a double play. Even three outs in one play, a triple play, {{is possible}}, though this is very rare. Players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team's dugout or bench. A runner may be stranded on base when a third <b>out</b> <b>is</b> recorded against another player on the team. Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat as every half-inning begins with the bases empty of runners.|$|E

However, we know that {{whenever}} Allen goes out he takes Brown with him, and thus we know as a general rule that if Allen <b>is</b> <b>out,</b> Brown <b>is</b> <b>out.</b> So if Carr <b>is</b> <b>out</b> then the statements [...] "if Allen <b>is</b> <b>out</b> then Brown <b>is</b> in" [...] and [...] "if Allen <b>is</b> <b>out</b> then Brown <b>is</b> out" [...] would both be true at the same time.|$|R

5|$|The force out: {{recorded}} {{against a}} runner who {{is required to}} attempt to advance—either because the runner is on first base and a batted ball lands in fair territory, or because the runner immediately behind on the basepath is thus required to attempt to advance—but fails to reach the next base before a fielder touches the base while holding the ball. The ground <b>out</b> <b>is</b> technically a special case of the force out.|$|E
5|$|The hunt of {{the pilot}} whale is known by the locals as the Grindadráp. There are no fixed hunting seasons. As soon as a pod close enough to land is spotted, the locals set out to begin the hunt, after {{approval}} from the sysselman. The animals are driven into a bay which is approved for whaling by the Faroese government, and then {{they try to make}} the whales to beach themselves. The only way <b>out</b> <b>is</b> being blocked off by some of the boats, which stay there until men who have been waiting on shore have slaughtered all the whales.|$|E

5|$|The smash {{success of}} Docter's 2009 film Up {{encouraged}} those at Pixar to allow Docter to create another film {{with a more}} sophisticated story. Inside <b>Out</b> <b>is</b> the first Pixar film without input from co-founder and former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who died in 2011. In addition, the film did not have as much input from chief creative officer John Lasseter, who was focused on restructuring Walt Disney Animation Studios in Los Angeles {{at the time of}} its production. Executives at Disney and Pixar were positive at the proposal of making Inside Out, but acknowledged it would be difficult to market.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} player's turn batting or plate {{appearance is}} complete when the player reaches base, hits a home run, makes an out, or hits a ball {{that results in}} the team's third out, {{even if it is}} recorded against a teammate. On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third <b>out</b> <b>is</b> recorded against a teammate—for instance, a runner getting caught stealing (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat. The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game. Children's games often have more liberal substitution rules.|$|E
5|$|Dig Me <b>Out</b> <b>is</b> the {{follow-up}} to Sleater-Kinney's highly acclaimed second album Call the Doctor, released in 1996 by the queercore independent record label Chainsaw Records. Call the Doctor confirmed the band's {{reputation as one}} of the major musical acts from the Pacific Northwest, rebelling against gender roles, consumerism, and indie rock's male-dominated hierarchy. After the release of Call the Doctor, drummer Janet Weiss of Quasi joined the band. Previously, the band had had a number of temporary drummers, including Misty Farrell, Lora Macfarlane, and Toni Gogin. Weiss would eventually become Sleater-Kinney's longest serving and current drummer. For its third album, Sleater-Kinney worked again with producer John Goodmanson. The band left Chainsaw Records and decided to release the album through Kill Rock Stars, another independent record label which singer and guitarist Corin Tucker thought had better resources to ensure the band's distribution. Goodmanson also remarked that Kill Rock Stars afforded the band a generous amount of studio time for an independent label, stating that Call the Doctor only took four days to record while Dig Me Out was recorded over the period of eight days.|$|E

In the first week of the massacres, there were reports in the Israeli press that Israel did not want to put all its ground forces in Gaza because it was preparing attacks on Iran. Then there were reports it was planning attacks on Lebanon. It is a lunatic state.|$|E
5|$|Inside <b>Out</b> <b>is</b> a 2015 American 3D computer-animated comedy-drama {{adventure}} film, co-written {{and directed}} by Pete Docter. The film {{is set in the}} mind of a young girl named Riley Andersen (Kaitlyn Dias), where five personified emotions—Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling)—try to lead her through life as she moves to a new city and has to adjust to her new life. After premiering it at the 68th Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2015, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures released the film theatrically in the United States on June 19, 2015. Made on a production budget of $175 million, Inside Out grossed a worldwide total of $857 million, making it the seventh highest-grossing film of 2015 and the 49th highest-grossing film of all time as of July 2016. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, surveyed 317 reviews and judged 98% to be positive.|$|E
5|$|Krusty is {{inspired}} {{to return to}} doing low-key events, where he structures a new image for himself as a stand-up comedian who tells the truth, criticizes commercialism, and refuses to sell out to corporate America. He also changes his appearance, sporting a dark sweater and tying his hair in a ponytail. Observing his newfound popularity, two marketing executives try to persuade Krusty to endorse a new sport utility vehicle called the Canyonero. Although he tries to resist, he eventually succumbs to the lure of money. After promoting the Canyonero at a comedy performance in Moe's Tavern, he is booed off stage by the patrons. He finally admits to himself that comedy is not in his blood and selling <b>out</b> <b>is.</b> The episode ends with an extended advertisement for the Canyonero, as Krusty and Bart leave Moe's tavern in Krusty's new SUV.|$|E
