[...] Snarker called Brittany and Santana her [...] "new favourite Glee pairing", and commented: [...] "While Heather Morris (Brittany) and Naya Rivera (Santana) have had minimal screen time, they’ve made it count.

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. Ramsey Isler of IGN said Cartman {{worked well}} for a Beck satire, and said, [...] "The real accomplishment of this episode is how it totally roasted a semi-political figure, without being political at all." [...] However, Isler said the script loses focus {{with the appearance of}} the Smurfs, and that Gordon's death was disturbing and inappropriate in the light of recent school shootings in the United States. The A.V. Club writer Sean O'Neal, a vocal critic of Beck, said mocking Beck is an easy task, but the episode [...] "handled it with just enough of the show's usual surrealist bent that it was never wholly predictable". He praised some of the episode's unexpected elements, like Cartman's Smurf film and Wendy's surprise resignation. Carlos Delgado of iF magazine said [...] "Dances with Smurfs" [...] became [...] "a little strange" [...] starting with Cartman's Smurf story, but he called the episode [...] "smart, sharp, and poignant". Delgado said the episode had less [...] "laugh out loud" [...] humor than traditional South Park episodes, in favor of intelligent satire.

The original plan was for Michael to have fallen asleep in the sun, while having sunblock all over him, except for his foot. According to BJ Novak, the episode was originally going to be called [...] "My Grilled Foot", but writer Mindy Kaling thought it was [...] "too weird for people to tune in and watch that".

Porter also praised Rashida Jones's performance during her hangover scenes. Matt Fowler of IGN said he enjoyed Tom's efforts to [...] "become a high-roller this season", and said Andy and April were fantastic during their role-playing scenes.

[...] Harris commented that, [...] "Despite the sad {{seriousness}} of , the tightly wound Emma also is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funniest</b> characters in Glee. Go figure. It's funny, because everything is kind of heavy that's going on in her life, with these phobias and this guy she loves who’s married, yet she still {{is a bit of}} the comic relief." [...] Mandi Bierly for Entertainment Weekly noted of the episode [...] "Vitamin D" [...] that she had hoped Emma would decline Ken's proposal: [...] "I want Emma to be strong and know it’s better to be without someone for the right reason than to be with someone for the wrong one." [...] Mike Hale for the New York Times praised Mays' performance in the episode. He noted: [...] "Jayma Mays registered Emma’s devastation with just the slightest widening of those enormous eyes. In fact all the best non-singing moments in the episode were hers." ...|$|E
