5|$|Although {{the archaeological}} record does not provide {{examples}} of brushes or pens, analysis <b>of</b> <b>ink</b> strokes on the Postclassic codices suggests that it was applied with a brush with a tip fashioned from pliable hair. A Classic period sculpture from Copán, Honduras, depicts a scribe with an inkpot fashioned from a conch shell. Excavations at Aguateca uncovered a number of scribal artefacts from the residences of elite status scribes, including palettes and mortars and pestles.|$|E
5|$|Boxwood {{cut across}} the end-grain is hard enough for fine engraving, {{allowing}} greater detail than in normal woodcutting. This been the dominant method used since Bewick's time. In addition, since a wood engraving is inked on the face, it requires only low pressure to print an image, so the blocks last for many thousands of prints, and importantly can be assembled into a page of metal type for ordinary printing in a single run. In contrast, a copper plate engraving is inked in the engraved grooves, the face being wiped clean <b>of</b> <b>ink</b> before printing, so much higher pressure is required, and images must be printed separately from the text, at far greater expense.|$|E
5|$|Edwards {{then tried}} to change the deal with Dart. Instead of {{dividing}} the smuggled slaves between the two men, Edwards tried to keep all the slaves and instead repay the money Dart had advanced him, with some interest. Dart sued, and at the trial in March 1839 Edwards offered two forged documents claiming that Dart had sold {{his interest in the}} slaves to Edwards. In forging the documents, Edwards originally secured Dart's signature on a document written in a type <b>of</b> <b>ink</b> that could later be chemically removed. After Dart signed the document, Edwards then removed the original wording of the document and substituted a deed selling Dart's interest in the land and slaves. The documents were determined to be forgeries and on April 2, 1840, Dart was awarded $89,000. Edwards fled the Republic of Texas to the United States.|$|E
40|$|Improvements in {{printing}} {{technology and the}} wide accessibility of advanced printers has resulted {{in an increase in}} counterfeiting. Of particular interest to forensic document examiners, <b>ink</b> analysis <b>of</b> security documents has emerged as an important tool for the analysis, comparison, and association <b>of</b> <b>inks</b> to a potential production source. In this study, methods were developed for Py-GC/MS, ATR-FTIR, DART-MS, and MALDI-MS analyses <b>of</b> printing <b>inks</b> <b>of</b> four classes: 78 inkjet inks, 76 toners, 79 offset inks, and 86 intaglio inks in order to generate information on the organic chemical characterization <b>of</b> the <b>inks</b> to determine the ability to associate and discriminate the inks for uses in security document examinations. The suite of analytical techniques evaluated in the study focused on having the following analytical characteristics: 1) rapid analysis time, 2) little-to-no sample preparation, 3) minimal destructiveness to the sample, 4) allow for association <b>of</b> <b>inks</b> with the same source of origin as well as discrimination <b>of</b> <b>inks</b> originating from different sources. As a result of this study, a novel searchable library database <b>of</b> <b>inks</b> was developed for use with each analytical chemical method that allows for data fusion.

5|$|The game {{features}} an automap to help players navigate the {{different areas of}} the game. Additionally, the player can pick up maps of certain sections to reveal unexplored areas. To save their progress, players need to find ink ribbons and use them with a typewriter; the game features a limited supply <b>of</b> <b>ink</b> ribbons, so players cannot save their progress as many times as they want. The story of the game is slightly altered by the character the player chooses to play as, and certain choices the player makes in the game can impact the direction of the game and its ending. Upon completing the game under a certain difficulty setting and time limit, the player may unlock secret costumes for the main characters, bonus weapons, and special difficulty modes.|$|E
5|$|As a {{survival}} horror title, Resident Evil 2 features {{the same basic}} gameplay mechanics as its predecessor, Resident Evil. The player explores a fictional city while solving puzzles and fighting monsters. The game's two protagonists may be equipped with firearms, but limited ammunition adds a tactical element to weapon use. On the status screen, the player can check {{the condition of the}} protagonists, use medicine to heal their wounds, and assign weapons. The characters' current health can also be determined by their posture and movement speed. For example, a character will hold their stomach in pain if wounded, and will limp slowly if on the verge of death. The protagonists may carry a limited number of items, and must store others in boxes placed throughout the game world, where they may later be retrieved. Each protagonist is joined by a support partner {{during the course of the}} story. These characters accompany the player in certain scenes, and occasionally become playable. Certain rooms contain typewriters that the player may use to save the game. However, each save expends one of a limited number <b>of</b> <b>ink</b> ribbons, which the player must collect in the game world. The graphics of Resident Evil 2 are composed of real-time generated– and thus movable– polygonal character and item models, superimposed over pre-rendered backgrounds that are viewed from fixed camera angles.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} the player {{controlling}} the main character, Amaterasu, in a woodcut, watercolor style, cel-shaded environment, {{which looks like}} an animated Japanese ink-illustration (known as ink wash painting, sumi-e) with other styles of art. The gameplay style {{is a mix of}} action, platform, and puzzle gaming genres, and has been noted by many reviewers to have numerous similarities in overall gameplay style to The Legend of Zelda series, an inspiration that director Hideki Kamiya, a self-proclaimed Zelda-fan, has admitted has influenced his general game design. The main story is primarily linear, directed through by Amaterasu's guide Issun, though numerous side quests and optional activities allow for players to explore the game world and take the story at their own pace. By completing quests, side quests and small additional activities (such as making trees bloom into life or feeding wild animals), Amaterasu earns Praise, which can then be spent to increase various statistics of the character, such as the amount of health and number <b>of</b> <b>ink</b> wells for Celestial Brush techniques.|$|E
5000|$|Liquid {{ink roller}} ball pens flow {{extremely}} consistently and skip less than gel ink pens do. The lower viscosity <b>of</b> liquid <b>ink</b> {{increases the likelihood}} <b>of</b> consistent <b>inking</b> <b>of</b> the ball, whereas the higher viscosity <b>of</b> gel <b>ink</b> produces [...] "skipping", that is, occasional gaps in lines or letters.|$|R
50|$|The inks used {{in digital}} {{printing}} on glass mimic the CMYK color model and {{are made of}} ceramic frit and inorganic pigments and elements. The development <b>of</b> <b>inks</b> is a highly controlled production process to remove any variability in the final product. The consistency in replication <b>of</b> the <b>inks</b> results in high compatibility with the entire color palette <b>of</b> <b>inks.</b> The inks can therefore be digitally mixed and designers will know the precise outcome of the color every time. Printed glass panels can also be replaced when necessary without {{the risk of the}} new panels not matching the colors of the existing panels. The inks are also fully integrated with the machine and the image processing software meaning the development and the application <b>of</b> the <b>inks</b> required innovations both in science and technology.|$|R

5|$|Bewick {{made use}} of his close {{observation}} of nature, his remarkable visual memory, and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues {{to the character of}} his natural subjects, with humour and feeling. This was achieved by carefully varying the depth of the engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks with just the right amount <b>of</b> <b>ink,</b> mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness, and to press the block to the paper slowly and carefully, to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick. Not surprisingly, this made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick's readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a magnifying glass to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was transformative, and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children.|$|E
25|$|A {{well known}} {{response}} of cephalopods when threatened is to release large volumes <b>of</b> <b>ink.</b> Some cephalopods also release pseudomorphs ("false bodies"); smaller clouds <b>of</b> <b>ink</b> {{with a greater}} mucus content, which allows them to hold their shape for longer. These are expelled slightly away from the cephalopod; they are roughly the same volume and look like the cephalopod that released them. Predators have often been seen attacking a pseudomorph, allowing the cephalopod to escape.|$|E
