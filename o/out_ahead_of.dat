5|$|In 1877 during {{construction}} of the Durley Hill Cemetery, {{the remains of a}} grand Roman villa with over 30 rooms was discovered. However, {{construction of the}} cemetery went ahead, and the majority of the villa is now located beneath the Victorian cemetery and an adjacent road. The cemetery was expanded in 1922, and an archeological dig was carried <b>out</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> the interments, leading to the excavation of 17 rooms and the rescue of 10 elaborate mosaics.|$|E

We do not want them to get way <b>out</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> us, either, because these interstate highways are going to be very attractive highways for the East and West to travel on.|$|E
5|$|In general polling, Tancredo fared {{far worse}} than in straw polls. Early polls placed the {{candidate}} both {{above and below the}} 1% mark. However, in November 2007 he slightly moved up in polling, reaching the 2% mark and coming <b>out</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> his closest rival, Congressman Duncan Hunter of California. In a November 16 Gallup poll, Tancredo stood in seventh place at 2%, trailing Congressman Ron Paul of Texas by 3%. In a head-to-head matchup done by Rasmussen Reports on August 29, 2007, Tancredo trailed New York Senator Hillary Clinton by 13% finishing with 37% to Clinton's 50%. In a head-to-head matchup with Barack Obama administered on the same day, Tancredo finished with 31% to 48% for Obama.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the hurricane, a Royal Navy helicopter aboard the Argyll flew <b>out</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> the ship to start aerial damage assessments. Members of the Bermuda Regiment immediately began cleanup and recovery efforts, while the government provided tarps to affected homeowners. Sailors from the Argyll teamed up with Regiment soldiers upon the ship's arrival to continue relief work. Some 35of the vessel's crew members worked to clear debris from the runway at the airport, which reopened on October 19 after thorough evaluations. Including damage from Fay, about $2 million was spent on airport repairs, and the storms were later cited as evidence of the need for a newer terminal in a more protected location. All schools on the territory resumed classes by October 21.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began on}} 3 August 1943. Many {{details about the}} performances, lighting, camera angles, action, and effects were worked <b>out</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> {{time in order to}} not only keep the film under budget but also help achieve {{suspense}} on such a low budget. Dr. Jared Criswell, former pastor of the Fifth Avenue Spiritualist Church of New York City, served as a technical consultant on the film regarding psychic phenomena. The picture's final fight scene between the Finn, Pollo, and the mad Captain was shot on a dimly lit set to heighten the suspense and keep the audience from guessing who the victor might be, similar to the way Jacques Tourneur and Lewton had shot a similar scene in Cat People.|$|E
5|$|Using {{data from}} Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, {{scientists}} have found widespread deposits of chloride minerals. Evidence suggests that the deposits were formed from the evaporation of mineral enriched waters. The research suggests that lakes may have been scattered over {{large areas of the}} Martian surface. Usually chlorides are the last minerals to come out of solution. Carbonates, sulfates, and silica should precipitate <b>out</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> them. Sulfates and silica have been found by the Mars Rovers on the surface. Places with chloride minerals may have once held various life forms. Furthermore, such areas could preserve traces of ancient life.|$|E

5|$|The {{tour was}} another triumph for the leg-spin attack of O'Reilly and Grimmett, but O'Reilly was {{slightly}} overshadowed by his teammate in the Tests. With 44 wickets, Grimmett {{set a new}} record {{for the number of}} wickets by an Australian in a Test series, and he raised his Test career total to 216 wickets, beating the then world record of 189 by Englishman Sydney Barnes. O'Reilly took 27 Test wickets at an average of just over 17 runs each: the other bowlers in the Australian team took 27 wickets between them. On the tour as a whole, O'Reilly came <b>out</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> Grimmett, with 95 wickets against Grimmett's 92, and an average of 13.56 against 14.80. O'Reilly also revealed hitherto undiscovered batting talents, making an undefeated 56 in the Fourth Test in Johannesburg, and putting on 69 for the last wicket with Ernie McCormick. It was the only time in his first-class cricket career that he passed 50. During the tour, O'Reilly developed his leg trap; the opening batsmen Jack Fingleton and Bill Brown were used in these positions.|$|E
5|$|After {{struggling}} to establish himself at Crewe Alexandra, Roberts spent time on loan with Merseyside based outfit Southport. Roberts made his Southport debut {{just three days}} after signing for the club, playing the whole match in a 4–0 away defeat to Accrington Stanley. He featured {{in a total of}} six games for Southport, before then opting to join Chester City on a one-month loan deal. Roberts only started one game for Chester in a 5–0 defeat at Carlisle United, and did not feature again for the Cheshire side subsequent to this match. After his unsuccessful loan spell at Chester, Roberts was loaned out to Southport for a second time in March 2006, making his second debut for the club in a 2–1 win away to Forest Green Rovers, in which he was sent off in the 88th minute for two bookable offences. He returned to first team action in Southport's 1–1 draw against Altrincham, before playing the whole match in a 2–0 victory against Accrington Stanley at Haig Avenue. He played 12 times during his second loan spell at the club, playing his final game in Southport's 1–0 home loss against Aldershot Town in April 2006. Despite still being on the books at Crewe, Roberts had not made a first team appearance for the club since 2004 and was again loaned <b>out</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> the 2006–07 season, this time to Yorkshire-based Conference National side Halifax Town. He played his first game for Halifax in the club's first game of the 2006–07 campaign, starting in a 2–0 away defeat to Oxford United. He scored his first goal for Halifax in a 2–1 victory over Cambridge United, the first goal of the game. Roberts featured in a total of thirteen games for the Halifax, scoring once, before ending his loan spell at the club.|$|E
5|$|On lap 21, Rosberg made a {{pit stop}} for the {{intermediate}} tyres, leaving only Ricciardo and Hamilton {{at the front of}} the field on the full wet tyres. Ricciardo made the switch on lap 24, but Hamilton stayed out, opting to remain on the wet tyre until the track dried out enough to go straight to slicks. In the meantime, Verstappen had fought his way back into the top ten, after having started 21st. In the subsequent laps, Ricciardo was able to reduce the gap to Hamilton in the lead, edging as close as half a second by lap 28. Behind the leading pair, Rosberg was third ahead of Pérez and Vettel. The pivotal moment of the race followed on lap 31, when Hamilton changed to slick tyres. When Ricciardo followed suit a lap later, his pit crew were not ready for him and had the wrong tyres, resulting in a long stop, handing the lead to Hamilton, who stayed narrowly ahead of him. Sergio Pérez was another driver who benefited during the second round of stops, emerging in third. Rosberg was left in sixth after both Vettel and Alonso also came <b>out</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> him after the switch to dry tyres. On lap 34, Ricciardo made an attempt to repass Hamilton on track, but Hamilton successfully defended his position.|$|E

25|$|Elliott pitted on lap 314. He had {{a quicker}} pit stop since {{he still had}} use of first gear. He came <b>out</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> Kulwicki on the track. Terry Labonte led lap 315, then he pitted. Elliott re-assumed the lead on lap 316, and led the final 13 laps. Elliott's laps led total came to 102 – one lap fewer than Kulwicki's 103. With Elliott leading, Kulwicki tucked into a {{comfortable}} second, conserved fuel, and did not mount a challenge for the lead. Kulwicki and his crew had already figured out that if Elliott led {{the rest of the}} way, Kulwicki would still clinch the five bonus points. Furthermore, Kulwicki had a comfortable lead over third place, and was not being challenged.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday, August 17, 1907 City Council President Charles Hiram Burnett Jr., {{filling in}} for the elected mayor as acting mayor of Seattle, {{declared}} the day Public Market Day and cut the ribbon. In the week {{leading up to the}} opening of the Pike Place Market, various rumors and stories of further corruption were reported by the Seattle Times. Roughly ten farmers pulled up their wagons on a boardwalk adjacent to the Leland Hotel. The Times alleged several reasons for the low turnout of farmers: Western Avenue wholesale commission men who had gone to the nearby valleys and farms to buy all the produce <b>out</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> time to ruin the event; threats of violence by commission men against farmers; and farmers' fear of possible boycotts and lack of business with the commission men if the Market idea did not succeed in the long term.|$|E
25|$|Charles Straub had {{a seat in}} {{the family}} circle close to the stairway; he was in the company of his friend Joseph Kreamer. He remembered, “we could hardly run down the stairs; we were crowded down.” Though at first he saw no smoke, {{by the time he had}} been carried down to the last flight, it had grown thicker. There he tripped and people fell on top of him. By then the last flight of stairs was dark and full of smoke. Straub {{struggled}} up and stumbled forward. He estimated that about twenty-five people had gotten <b>out</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> him. Wondrously, though he had been pushed down three flights of stairs and thought that hundreds had fallen on top of him, only about ten or twelve people came out onto the street after him. He waited around the Washington Street entrance for three-quarters of an hour, but he never saw his friend Kreamer emerge from the stairway, nor did he ever see him again.|$|E

500|$|At 03:00 on 13 March 1806, lookouts on Marengo spotted sails in the {{distance}} to the southeast. Ignoring arguments from Bruilhac that the sails could be a British battle squadron, Linois insisted that they were a merchant convoy and ordered his ships to advance. The night was dark and visibility was consequently extremely limited; Linois was therefore unaware of the nature of his quarry until the 98-gun second rate [...] loomed out of the night immediately ahead. Londons captain, Sir Harry Burrard Neale, had sighted Linois's sails at a distance and sailed to investigate, hanging signals with blue lights that notified the rest of Warren's squadron, which was strung <b>out</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> the slow sailing London, of his intentions.

500|$|A surface low {{can form}} {{in a variety}} of ways. Topography can create a surface low. Mesoscale {{convective}} systems can spawn surface lows that are initially warm core. The disturbance can grow into a wave-like formation along the front and the low is positioned at the crest. Around the low, the flow becomes cyclonic. This rotational flow moves polar air towards the equator {{on the west side of}} the low, while warm air move towards the pole on the east side. A cold front appears on the west side, while a warm front forms on the east side. Usually, the cold front moves at a quicker pace than the warm front and [...] "catches up" [...] with it due to the slow erosion of higher density air mass <b>out</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> the cyclone. In addition, the higher density air mass sweeping in behind the cyclone strengthens the higher pressure, denser cold air mass.
