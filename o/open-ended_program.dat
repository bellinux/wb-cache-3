25|$|Among the {{recommendations}} of the Baker Board, established {{in the wake of the}} Air Mail scandal, was that the proposals of the Drum Board be adopted: an increase in strength to 2,320 aircraft and establishment of GHQ Air Force as a permanent peacetime tactical organization, both to ameliorate the pressures for a separate air force and to exploit emerging capabilities in airpower. In the absence of a general headquarters (i.e. peacetime), GHQ Air Force would report to the General Staff. The War Plans Division of the Army reacted to {{the recommendations}} of the Baker Board by insisting that men and modern equipment for seven army divisions be procured before any increase in the Air Corps was begun, and opposed any immediate attempt to bring the Air Corps up to the 1,800 plane-strength first authorized in 1926, for fear of antagonizing the Navy. President Roosevelt approved an <b>open-ended</b> <b>program</b> to increase strength to 2,320 aircraft (albeit without any proviso for funding) in August 1934, and Secretary Dern approved the activation of GHQ Air Force in December 1934.|$|E

Pathway and network visualizations, rendered {{on a computer}} or published on paper, however, tend to be static, lacking in detail, and ill-equipped to explore the variety and quantities of data available today, and the complex causes we seek to understand. Results: RCytoscape integrates R (an <b>open-ended</b> <b>programming</b> environment rich in statistical power and datahandling facilities) and Cytoscape (powerful network visualization and analysis software). RCytoscape extends Cytoscape's functionality beyond what is possible with the Cytoscape graphical user interface. To illustrate the power of RCytoscape, {{a portion of the}} Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) data set from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is examined. Network visualization reveals previously unreported patterns in the data suggesting heterogeneous signaling mechanisms active in GBM Proneural tumors, with possible clinical relevance. Conclusions: Progress in bioinformatics and computational biology depends upon exploratory and confirmatory data analysis, upon inference, and upon modeling. These activities will eventually permit the prediction and control of complex biological systems.

The list of error return codes that HPI functions may return is also declared as open-ended. New versions of the HPI specification do not remove or change any existing enumerated values, but may add new values to an <b>open-ended</b> enumeration. User <b>programs</b> should accept values that are not currently defined and treat them as “valid but undefined.” By doing so, the program can continue to work when it is used with an implementation that is built to a newer version of the HPI specification, which may have defined new values for the enumeration.d) Data structures passed from HPI functions to the user may not grow in length in new versions of the HPI specification or change the format of the data that was defined in previous versions.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{increasing}} {{attention has been}} paid to communities with low physical access to full-service supermarkets, commonly called 2 ̆ 2 food deserts. 2 ̆ 2 These often have disproportionately high rates of poverty and minority residents, raising additional issues for local officials and advocates. Widespread research has also documented associations between poor access to supermarkets and negative health outcomes. To address these issues, coalitions of stakeholders have used development incentives known as 2 ̆ 2 fresh food financing 2 ̆ 2 to bring new supermarkets into food deserts, often invoking associative health claims as motivation. To date, few health evaluations have been completed, though of published results, few show improved health resulting from new supermarket development. This dissertation uses a multi-level, mixed-methods approach to understand three primary research questions: 1) How different types of development processes yield different types of supermarkets, 2) How different types of new supermarkets may drive different patterns of shopper adoption, and 3) How consumers engage with new supermarkets, and how might these behaviors be meaningful for health? A variety of primary and secondary data sources inform this research: an extensive document review, analysis of redemption data from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance <b>Program,</b> <b>open-ended</b> interviews with major fresh food financing stakeholders, and walking interviews and surveys with shoppers at a store developed with fresh food financing. The investigation finds that while a number of financing methods have been employed to improve access to supermarkets in food deserts, the highly professionalized tools promulgated by industry leaders and officials are most prevalent. Additionally, most projects include local development incentives, even those not specifically dedicated to expanding food access. Though the positive health effects of new supermarket development have not been empirically documented, this research shows that important diversity exists among the types of incentives and stores that have been created, which may also influence store adoption by low-income shoppers. Shoppers in this study grappled with changing their diets, even in the context of managing chronic disease conditions. These findings highlight important points of friction that must be addressed for new stores in food deserts to achieve desired health outcomes, and provide an illustrative model for those who hope to create greater synergy between community development and public health. ...|$|R

In an attempt to reverse this pattern, the establishment of youth gardening programs is gaining popularity throughout communities in the US. There currently {{is a great deal}} of momentum promoting the importance of the natural environment and physical activity – there are youth gardening programs being set up in locations such as local schools and local churches in an effort to help to educate the younger generation about the importance of the sustainability of natural resources and the food cycle to the continuing prosperity of Society. This master’s project examines the factors related to the establishment and effective operation of youth gardening <b>programs.</b> <b>Open-ended</b> interviews were conducted with administrators, founders and coordinators of 7 gardening programs in North Carolina and Utah that have a focus on the youth and/or community. All but one of the interviews was conducted face to face and each interview lasted between 1 - 2 hours. Key ideas and patterns from the interviews were identified through a standard qualitative data analysis method of classification and coding and categorizing the data. Principal themes from the interviews were recorded and cross-referenced with findings from the literature. Results highlight that gardening programs targeted at the youth population are important in promoting environmental sustainability. Program structures range from an association with a school through to entrepreneurial initiatives targeting the teen population. Funding, staffing considerations, bureaucracy, establishing community partnerships and using appropriate engagement strategies are the main challenges limiting the success of programs. These issues can be addressed through appropriate planning, community engagement and ‘learning’ through accessing publicly available resources. There is definitely a place for youth gardening programs within Society and at the end of the day the success of these programs is due to the underlying enthusiasm and passion of the coordinators and all stakeholders associated with the project...|$|R
40|$|Metabiology is a {{mathematical}} theory mainly based on algorithmic information theory and {{allows us to}} study an <b>open-ended</b> evolution of <b>programs,</b> that is, to study how fast the organisms/programs become more complex or more creative without never stagnate at a maximum level of complexity or creativity. We take, as starting point, the first chaitinian metabiological models in which the organisms are computable systems, Nature (or environment) is a hyper-computable system, mutations are randomly generated computable systems (that is, random algorithmic mutations) and the fitnesses are measured by how big is {{the output of the}} organisms. In this context, this paper focuses on two questions: Assuming that organisms are uncomputable systems, should metabiology become unsuitable or unsound? Or, on the other hand, assuming that Nature itself is a computable system, should metabiology become unsuitable or unsound? Thus, the main purpose is to demonstrate that metabiology walks towards a general theory of open-ended evolutionary systems, whether these systems are sub-computable, computable or hyper-computable. As a secondary purpose we show that scientific and philosophical consequences of our mathematical results spread across fundamental questions about biology and artificial life, as well as, about physics and artificial intelligence. To satisfy these two objectives, we build two new metabiological models for two new different configurations of organisms and nature. First, we demonstrate it is possible to build a metabiological evolution in which nature is a computable system and, hence, it makes the organisms and mutations to be sub-computable systems. To show this we introduce the recursive relative uncomputability (a computable/recursive version of the relative uncomputability that occurs among different Turing degrees). We do with Turing, Radó and Chaitin the same Skolem did with Cantor by making a relativization of the Busy-Beaver´s uncomputability in relation to the Omega number, so that this new uncomputability can exist between a computer and any of his sub-computers. As a consequence, we introduce the “paradox” of uncomputability which says that exists at least one function that is not computable if we “look from the inside”, but that is computable if we “look from the outside”. Further, we correlate this pseudo-paradox with problems of human creativity and artificial intelligence and with problems of consciousness, artificial life and the computability of the Universe. Second, we build a metabiological model for the evolution of hyper-programs in which the organisms are hyper-computable systems of any finite order and nature is a hyper-program of ordinal order ω. In this last model we demonstrate it is possible an evolution of organisms/hyper-programs, with just “blind” random algorithmic mutations (it means, that do not take into consideration previous organisms/hyper-programs), which progressively leads the organisms/hyper-programs to be able of solving any problem in the arithmetical hierarchy. Allied to this, we discuss about computability or uncomputability of “living beings” and upon the possibility of mathematically studying metabiological evolutionary systems that can surpass, as much as we want, the “frontier” of the computable...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{formative}} {{evaluation of the}} Hewlett Foundation's Early Learning Innovation Fund that began in 2011 {{as part of the}} Quality Education in Developing Countries (QEDC) initiative.   The Fund has four overarching objectives, which are to: promote promising approaches to improve children's learning; strengthen the capacity of organizations implementing those approaches; strengthen those organizations' networks and ownership; and grow 20 percent of implementing organizations into significant players in the education sector. The Fund's original design was to create a "pipeline" of innovative approaches to improve learning outcomes, with the assumption that donors and partners would adopt the most successful ones. A defining feature of the Fund was that it delivered assistance through two intermediary support organizations (ISOs), rather than providing funds directly to implementing organizations. Through an open solicitation process, the Hewlett Foundation selected Firelight Foundation and TrustAfrica to manage the Fund. Firelight Foundation, based in California, was founded in 1999 with a mission to channel resources to community-based organizations (CBOs) working {{to improve the lives of}} vulnerable children and families in Africa. It supports 12 implementing organizations in Tanzania for the Fund. TrustAfrica, based in Dakar, Senegal, is a convener that seeks to strengthen African-led initiatives addressing some of the continent's most difficult challenges. The Fund was its first experience working specifically with early learning and childhood development organizations. Under the Fund, it supported 16 such organizations: one in Mali and five each in Senegal, Uganda and Kenya. At the end of 2014, the Hewlett Foundation commissioned Management Systems International (MSI) to conduct a mid-term evaluation assessing the implementation of the Fund exploring the extent to which it achieved intended outcomes and any factors that had limited or enabled its achievements. It analyzed the support that the ISOs provided to their implementing organizations, with specific focus on monitoring and evaluation (M&E). The evaluation included an audit of the implementing organizations' M&E systems and a review of the feasibility of compiling data collected to support an impact evaluation. Finally, the Foundation and the ISOs hoped that this evaluation would reveal the most promising innovations and inform planning for Phase II of the Fund. The evaluation findings sought to inform the Hewlett Foundation and other donors interested in supporting intermediary grant-makers, early learning innovations and the expansion of innovations. TrustAfrica and Firelight Foundation provided input to the evaluation's scope of work. Mid-term evaluation reports for each ISO provided findings about their management of the Fund's Phase I and recommendations for Phase II. This final evaluation report will inform donors, ISOs and other implementing organizations about the best approaches to support promising early learning innovations and their expansion. The full report outlines findings common across both ISOs' experience and includes recommendations in four key areas: adequate time; appropriate capacity building; advocacy and scaling up; and evaluating and documenting innovations. Overall, both Firelight Foundation and TrustAfrica supported a number of effective innovations working through committed and largely competent implementing organizations. The <b>program's</b> <b>open-ended</b> nature avoided being prescriptive in its approach, but based on the lessons learned in this evaluation and the broader literature, the Hewlett Foundation and other donors could have offered more guidance to ISOs to avoid the need to continually relearn some lessons. For example, over the evaluation period, it became increasingly evident that the current context demands more focused advance planning to measure impact on beneficiaries and other stakeholders and a more concrete approach to promoting and resourcing potential scale-up. The main findings from the evaluation and recommendations are summarized here...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to assess the equity and efficiency of in-kind income transfers. The analytical framework employed incorporated key concepts of the utility interdependence paradigm from economic welfare theory. This paradigm views income transfers as social goods and suggests that social as well as private benefits may be derived from the redistribution of income. This study attempted to assess some of the empirical implications of the utility interdependence argument through the investigation of the low-income housing and Food Stamp programs in Multnomah County, Oregon for FY 1973. Data were drawn from agency files, published statistics and documents, interviews with program administrators, and a survey of the records of 498 Non-Public Assistance Food stamp households. The private and social benefits and costs of the programs were estimated. The program participation rates and the socio-economic characteristics of recipient households were ascertained. Particular attention was devoted to an evaluaLion of the efficacy of in-kind transfers in inducing substitution effects or producing social benefits through the alteration of the consumption patterns of the target population. In addition to an economic analysis of in-kind transfers, the political environment of welfare legislation was detailed. The results of this research suggest that in-kind income transfers are an inefficient and inequitable method of redistributing income. All programs investigated were characterized by high administrative costs. The administrative share of the public program budget ranged from 20 % in the Food Stamp Program to over 50 % in Public Housing. All programs were found to be inequitable in that households with similar socio-economic characteristics did not receive similar benefits. Housing programs discriminate among the equally needy by restricting supply. In the Food Stamp Program, a complex income determination formula, which is used to calculate program benefits, results in a considerable variation in the subsidies provided to households of equivalent size and income. The low-income housing and Food Stamp programs were also found to be ineffective in producing those social benefits which are specifically related to changes in the consumption patterns of the target population as a whole. While housing programs were found to induce substitution effects by furnishing large subsidies to a small number of households, only 5 % of the eligible received benefits. Programs which leave {{the vast majority of the}} poorly housed untouched were judged unlikely to significantly diminish the external diseconomies presumed to be associated with the housing expenditure patterns of the entire population of eligible. In contrast, the Food stamp Program provides less generous subsidies to all eligible applicants. Food stamp subsidies were found to be insufficient to generate substitution effects; the food consumption patterns demanded of recipient households were not different from the food expenditure patterns of comparable households with income entirely in cash. While the distribution of benefits in the housing and Food stamp programs strongly favors the poor, large numbers of non-poor are officially eligible for assistance. It was estimated that 37 % of the households in the country were eligible for low-income housing and approximately 46 % were eligible for food stamps. While the tight supply of housing transfers limits the growth of program participation, an enormous expansion of participation in the <b>open-ended</b> Food Stamp <b>Program</b> is possible. The economic analysis of in-kind transfer programs emphasized their deficiencies as redistributive mechanisms. However, the political potency of in-kind programs was found to be considerable. Policy-makers appear to be responsive to pressures to perpetuate and expand established programs, rather than to empirically validate the assumptions on which they are based. In view of the political popularity of in-kind transfers and the public antipathy to transfers of cash, it is probable that transfers in-kind will command an increasing share of the welfare budget...|$|R
40|$|Nutrition {{education}} {{is one of}} the strategies that addresses high levels of malnutrition in the world. Since independence in 1963. Kenya has instituted socio-economic, food security, nutrition and health policies to improve the nutrition and quality of life of it 2 ̆ 7 s people. In spite of these policies, one third of the Kenyan population is undernourished. This study was planned to establish how nutrition {{education is}} conducted in the Ministry of Health Thika District through a rural child growth monitoring program and to generate and reflect on women 2 ̆ 7 s participation in decision making in the <b>program.</b> <b>Open-ended</b> interviews were conducted with 21 women from the program, 4 community health workers and 16 nutrition stuff from Thika District. Focus groups, in-depth interviews and eight observations of the child growth monitoring sessions over nine months of fieldwork, provide data for this study. Participants were engaged actively in the entire research process. A participatory process was introduced by asking participants to contribute to the research agenda and make suggestions on what they wanted the program to address and how to do so. The process was developed through continuous dialogue and decision making. Reliability of data was ensured by conducting the research in the natural environment of the program and {{for an extended period of}} time. Triangulation of data and data collection methods and providing feedback to participants as a way to crosscheck the findings, validated data. Descriptive statistics analysed the data from the open-ended interviews whereas qualitative data were coded and analysed according to emerging themes and issues and synthesised to address the research questions. Results are presented by use of narrative to exemplify the concepts. The findings of this study show that nutrition education is important but what makes it work are the economic and food security concerns of the people. Findings reveal that although government nutrition staff and participants of the program identify a wide spectrum of causes and solutions to nutrition problems, implementation of nutrition education narrowly focuses on provision of nutrition information. This narrow focus is emphasised by government nutrition staff who focus more on curative than preventive nutrition. Nutrition staff have minimal training in primary health care and none in participatory approaches although they are expected to promote community participation. On the other hand, volunteer community health workers once trained, are left to plan and implement the program with minimal supervision, motivation or visible recognition. Findings show that there are no written nutrition education plans and that once nutrition programs are set in place, the programs are left to go on without reflection on their achievements. This study revealed that grassroot personnel have not accessed government policies on nutrition and community participation that they are supposed to implement and that there are limited resources set aside for nutrition within the Ministry of Health. Participation was promoted in the growth monitoring program by planning the research together with and progressing according to the expressed needs of participants. Women 2 ̆ 7 s participation in the program identified the realities of food accessibility and lack of money that influence nutrition. Empowerment was evidenced by diversifying the program to include an income activity and development of a curriculum based on the knowledge women wanted. Selection of a separate committee for the income activity, evidence of interdependent decision making and criticism of dependency are some of the outcomes of participation. Findings show that participation demands commitment and time from all actors. Participants are willing to make that commitment when they perceive individual benefits for them as a result of their participation. This research reveals that motivation and supervision are considered important for the community health workers. These findings show that there is potential for a nutrition program to respond to the realities of people such as appropriate nutrition knowledge, food accessibility and incomes by negotiating program priorities between the participants and nutrition facilitators through participation. A model of participation that I recommend in this study is one that has clear reasons for participation and incorporates an outsider’s perspectives to catalyse the process. This enables local participants to see possibilities which they have not seen due to familiarity with their circumstances. Participation strategy should be able to link with research in order to contribute to publicity and advocacy. Linkage with policy ensures that the process may be addressed practically by current government policies. Participants should engage in a continuous process of assessing the program goals, design, action and analysis. This research recommends nutrition education strategies that explore training in participatory approaches for facilitators. Training should extend to work with community health workers in the community to design and clarify monitoring and evaluation at the community level. Participants in the program should have a voice to decide how the program functions. For effectiveness, an analysis of the resources required to implement participatory approaches is essential. Research that focuses on non-participating mothers, that analyses measures and cost effectiveness of participation und studies that compare the process in different contexts in order to make positive decisions that can influence policy are recommended. The ultimate outcome of this research is that although government policies that promote nutrition and participation in health are in existence in Kenya, grassroot nutrition staff do not access these policies. Promotion of nutrition is worsened by the weak link between the growth monitoring program, the health sector and collaborating non-governmental organisations at the grassroot level on the one hand and between nutrition staff at different government levels. This research recommends that what is required to address the broad nature of nutrition problems are not only policies on nutrition and participation but ensuring the practice of these policies that will bring about a more realistic manner of solving complex nutrition problems. This thesis explains how policy on food security and nutrition at the government level is useless unless those at all relevant levels espccially grassroot government personnel and the community are actively engaged in planning and implementing such policies...|$|R
