5|$|The {{utility of}} money derives from {{circulation}} and loan-making. A village of ten households may have 100,000 coins. If the cash {{is stored in}} the household of one individual, even after a century, the sum remains 100,000. If the coins are circulated through business transactions so that every individual of the ten households can enjoy {{the utility of the}} 100,000 coins, then the utility will amount to that of 1,000,000 cash. If circulation continues without stop, the utility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> will be beyond enumeration.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Yip and Laurentia Tan, who won two bronze medals in equestrian events, sparked public {{debate about the}} {{treatment}} and recognition of disabled athletes in Singapore. Letters to The Straits Times criticised the poor coverage of the Paralympics. Many Singaporeans also commented about the disparity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> awards handed out by the government: S$1,000,000 for an Olympic gold and S$100,000 for a Paralympic gold. When the issues were raised in Parliament, MCYS parliamentary secretary Teo Ser Luck promised to study plans to give disabled athletes greater support and to include them in sporting programmes such as Project 0812, a training programme for top Singaporean sportspeople. Two months later, the cash rewards for Paralympic medals were doubled and funding for the Singapore National Paralympic Council was increased.|$|E
