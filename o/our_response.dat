25|$|Distractor {{inhibition}} {{model is}} the oldest model that explains the negative priming effect {{as the result of}} selective attention to a target stimulus. When we pay attention to a particular stimulus, we perceive other stimuli surrounding the target as distractors in order to help focus. But when one of those distractors becomes the new target of attention, <b>our</b> <b>response</b> to the target is hampered due to immediate residual inhibition. Selective attention is the ability to respond to a specific object when there are other distractors that also compete for a response. To explain this selective attention, the distractor inhibition model proposes a dual mechanism involving excitation to boost target signal and inhibition to suppress distractors. This inhibition is triggered when there is a mismatch between the internal representations of the target and a distractor. Inhibition of the distractor's internal representation is a way of helping to selectively attend to the target stimulus. This inhibition decays gradually when the stimulus is no longer present to help with the next target. However, if a distractor stimulus is re-encountered as the target, the internal representation of the distractor stimulus may continue to be suppressed because it is too soon for the decay to dissipate already. This {{is referred to as the}} transient residual inhibition. This inhibition also impairs the processing of an appropriate response to the new target stimulus and results in greater reaction time.|$|E
500|$|After his {{retirement}} from an mechanical failure, Bräck stated it affected his championship chances slightly and {{his retirement}} {{from the race}} was [...] "something that you don't want to have happen but unfortunately it happens sometimes and today {{it was one of}} those days." [...] Three days after the race, Tracy and Takagi was penalized by CART chief stewart Chris Kneifel for [...] "unjustifiable risk" [...] and for causing several caution periods by contact with other competitors. Tracy had two championship points deducted and was placed on probation for the next three road or street course races, while Takagi also had two points taken off his total and was given a probation period of three events. Kneifel said why the penalties were issued: We did not want to simply issue probations without accompanying them with a strong signal that actions like this will not be tolerated. Championship points are very hard-earned, and they're more valuable than money. We want <b>our</b> <b>response</b> to send out the very strong message that this isn't a slap on the wrist, or a token punishment.|$|E

2500|$|Haggard {{developed}} a concept he called [...] "The Life-Giving Church", which amounted to his ministry practice. He believed that churches and their members either lived [...] "in the Tree of Life" [...] or [...] "in the Tree of Knowledge {{of good and}} evil", referring to the two trees in the Garden of Eden (see Gen. 2:9). He wrote a book, The Life-Giving Church, to expound on this difference, and said that motivations are the key difference between two types of Christians. For instance, Haggard proposed, two women can stand outside an abortion clinic with protest signs. The [...] "tree of life" [...] protestor is there because she loves the unborn and has compassion for the mother and father. The [...] "tree of knowledge of good and evil" [...] protestor has come because she believes abortion is evil and must be stopped. [...] "One way we can tell which tree we are living in," [...] writes Haggard, [...] "is <b>our</b> <b>response</b> to sin... {{one of the greatest}} marks of bearing His [...] character is <b>our</b> <b>response</b> to someone else's sin. If we handle others' mistakes with a life-giving attitude, then we (and they) have the opportunity to enjoy great power and freedom. But if we handle others' mistakes negatively, then we're eating from the wrong tree and will begin to die." [...] Christians who live in the [...] "tree of life," [...] writes Haggard, [...] "grow in their understanding of right and wrong, and they find great insight, wisdom, victory, and joy in the stream of Jesus' righteousness." [...] Those who dwell in the opposite tree find and display [...] "frustration, judgmental attitudes, and death." ...|$|E
2500|$|This theory {{proposes that}} {{negative}} priming effect {{is the result}} of interference due to the target being located where the distractor was once located. When the target stimulus and distractor stimulus are repeatedly placed in the same location, we know their respective location and pay attention more to the location of the target than the target itself. <b>Our</b> <b>response</b> to the target is also faster because we have already identified where to pay attention. This is called Simon effect, which refers our innate tendency to respond faster and more accurately when stimuli occur in the same location. This can be explained by neuroscience in terms of neural facilitation and short-term plasticity. However, if the positions of the stimuli {{are not the same as}} before, it is no longer easy to attend to the target as it once was. The feature mismatch hypothesis states that inhibition occurs when there is a mismatch between the target and its location.|$|E

The Armenians claimed that the attack {{was in response to}} cross-border shelling of Armenian villages by Azeri forces from Nakhchivan. David Zadoyan, a 42-year-old Armenian physicist and mayor of the region, said that the Armenians lost patience after months of firing by the Azeris. [...] "If they were sitting on our hilltops and harassing us with gunfire, what do you think <b>our</b> <b>response</b> should be?" [...] he asked. The government of Nakhchivan denied these charges and instead asserted that the Armenian assault was unprovoked and specifically targeted the site of a bridge between Turkey and Nakhchivan. [...] "The Armenians do not react to diplomatic pressure," [...] Nakhchivan foreign minister Rza Ibadov told the ITAR-Tass news agency, [...] "It's vital to speak to them in a language they understand." [...] Speaking to the agency from the Turkish capital Ankara, Ibadov said that Armenia's aim in the region was to seize control of Nakhchivan. According to Human Rights Watch, hostilities broke out after three people were killed when Armenian forces began shelling the region.|$|E

The present paper illustrates, using an empirical example, the contributions of a mixed methods research approach can have in generating mixed insights on two TEFA strategies: the implementation of the audience response system and practice quizzes.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about how some people are ‘inside’ the {{protection}} of the law, while others are ‘outside’. More specifically it {{is about how}} some people are left vulnerable because of certain migration policies, criminalisation, economic exploitation and the exclusionary logic of borders and nations. An important question framing the issue is how the relationship between the sovereign nation-state, its legal residents and the ‘illegal’ migrants is or should be constituted and what fundamental principles that should guide these relationships of power or disempowerment. Irregular migration stands as a huge contemporary challenge and <b>our</b> <b>responses</b> so far seem inadequate because they do not appear to stop irregular migration, and because they seem to bring us at odds with moral and human rights principles. In this thesis I will argue that we need to dramatically rethink <b>our</b> <b>responses</b> to borders and irregular migration and that the promotion of a human rights sensitive agenda can show us new ways to approach this critical issue...|$|R
