40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} of <b>outsourcing</b> tax <b>audit</b> <b>work</b> in Malaysian tax system to enhance administration efficiency, to curb tax evasion and abusive avoidance, and to improve revenue collection without introducing a new tax. The current tax audit, carried out by internal auditors of Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia, could only be performed on a small numbers of taxpayers due to high administrative cost in terms of audit cost and cost to employ and train more audit personnel. Nevertheless, without tax audit, tax non-compliance activity could not be curbed and government would be {{at high risk of}} losing its revenue. One of the possible ways to increase <b>audit</b> <b>work</b> is through strategic outsourcing. However, decision to outsource tax work should be critically examined because <b>outsourcing</b> of tax <b>audit</b> is a policy that could potentially affect every taxpayer. This paper discusses the views of the stakeholders (tax authorities, the taxpayers and tax agents) on the value of tax <b>audit</b> <b>outsourcing.</b> Using a mixed method approach, this study finds contradicting opinions on the idea of implementing external tax audit in Malaysia. While the tax authorities are hesitant to the idea, the companies as tax payers and the tax agents show favorable responds to the implementation of <b>outsourced</b> tax <b>audit</b> in Malaysia...|$|R

Remote data auditing scheme enables cloud user to confirm the integrity of her outsourced file via the auditing against cloud storage, without downloading the file from cloud. In view of the significant computational cost caused by the <b>auditing</b> process, <b>outsourced</b> <b>auditing</b> model is proposed to make user <b>outsource</b> the heavy <b>auditing</b> task to third party auditor (TPA). Although the first <b>outsourced</b> <b>auditing</b> scheme can protect against the malicious TPA, this scheme enables TPA to have read access right over user’s outsourced data, which is a potential risk for user data privacy. In this paper, we introduce the notion of User Focus for <b>outsourced</b> <b>auditing,</b> which emphasizes the idea that lets user dominate her own data. Based on User Focus, our proposed scheme not only can prevent user’s data from leaking to TPA without depending on data encryption but also can avoid the use of additional independent random source that {{is very difficult to}} meet in practice. We also describe how to make our scheme support dynamic updates. According to the security analysis and experimental evaluations, our proposed scheme is provably secure and significantly efficient...|$|R

In each case, we distinguish between control evaluation and substantive testing. We find that involvement in consulting impacts reliance on work undertaken {{and the use of}} internal auditors as assistants for control evaluation. External auditors make greater use of internal auditors as assistants for substantive testing when internal audit is provided in-house. Overall, external auditors use internal audit more for control evaluation tasks than for substantive testing. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} suggests an increasing need for interactions among board of directors, management, internal audit and external audit as the four components of corporate governance and presents internal audit {{as a resource}} for the other components. External auditing standards that originated in the Western world, which are also being applied in developing countries, recommend external auditor’s reliance on internal audit to achieve audit efficiency. Nevertheless, whether this efficiency motive explains such reliance in corporate governance settings that differ from the West has not been sufficiently explored as yet. This study examines external auditor reliance on internal <b>audit</b> <b>work</b> using questionnaire survey of 119 external auditors in Ethiopia. Mann-Whitney U test results suggest that external auditors’ reliance on internal <b>audit</b> <b>work</b> is not significantly associated with the competitiveness of external audit sub-markets in Ethiopia.

Data were gathered using questionnaires to interview the heads of IAFs, namely chief audit executives (CAEs), and the users of internal audit services, namely the chairpersons of the audit committees (CACs), as well as the accounting officers (AOs) of national government departments in South Africa. The findings indicate that the respondents preferred in-house IAFs to outsourced IAFs, because of the perceived commitment to governance by in-house IAFs. However, {{due to a lack of}} technical expertise and a shortage of competent internal auditors, the IAF is often <b>outsourced</b> to external <b>audit</b> service providers.
