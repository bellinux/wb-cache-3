40|$|James Joyce’s Ulysses rewrites the Homeric Odyssey {{in such a}} {{way that}} the ancient myth {{provides}} a structural pattern, which gives order and meaning to a seemingly chaotic and meaningless contemporary world – an aspect which T.

As the characters of Ulysses are ignorant of this <b>ordering</b> <b>device,</b> they function as Jungian archetypes rather than individuals: Their deeds correspond to a mythical framework which is not actively remembered but provides a collective unconsciousness that guides their lives as a principle of order and continuity. What they do is meaningful although they consider themselves as insignificant agents thrown into a seemingly chaotic world. Whereas scholars have focused on Homer’s Odyssey as an archetypal (i. e. collective unconscious) key to the cultural memory of the mythical roots of Western culture, they have turned a comparatively blind eye to the fact that Homer’s corresponding work of the Iliad has a similar function for the mythopoetic design of Ulysses. This paper is going to reconstruct Joyce’s neglected intertextual dialogue with the Iliad as an archetypal key to the cultural memory of the roots of Western civilisation...|$|E

40|$|Several {{atomic level}} {{problems}} such as uneven oxidation film or generation of lattice defects {{take place in the}} fabrication processes of nano-meter <b>order</b> <b>devices.</b> Among them，dislocation accumulation is a serious problem. Generation and accumulation of dislocations are known to take place during the cooling processes of device fabrication due to its thermo-plastic deformation. Dislocations accumulated in the electron channel have an enormous effect on the electronic state of the device，increase the signal delay and obstruct devices from normal operation. Therefore，it is important to understand the deformation and the dislocation accumlation for the fabrications of nano-mater <b>order</b> <b>devices.</b> On the other hand, impurity doping is an indispensable process fof the device fabrication, and also important in dislocation accumulation. In this study, we make numerical models of ULSI cells where impurities are doped at some limited areas.

A “center of coordination ” in an airport is used as an example to show how a schedule, used as an <b>ordering</b> <b>device</b> within the ongoing work, operates at the same time as a form of normative prescription for what the work should come to. The schedule demonstrates how prescriptive representations presuppose the work of their en-actment, in ways that differ from representations used to describe “natural” events, insofar as the former are constitutive of the processes and practices to which the artifacts are accountable. Finally the paper draws on the work of John Law (2004) to show how consistent relations, i. e. orderings, are maintained through routines that, in producing other relations, constitute mess. In this re-spect, the order created by the researcher in analyzing the situated use of the schedule is not different in kind from the order created by the members ’ practic-es to manage the traffic of planes...|$|E

The present essay intends {{to study the}} ordering factors, which {{have been at the}} base of such developments, as ways of a juridical dimensioning of justice. It is a question of considering these systematic profiles from their relationship with the socio-political context which characterises the demand for justice. From such point of view, in the European legal experience which unwinds starting with the Late Middle Ages, two great approaches can be traced out; the watershed is represented by the use, {{at the end of the}} 18 th century, of the statute law as an <b>ordering</b> <b>device.</b> In the time of ius commune, the demand for justice springs from a pluralistic socio-political organisation and is, therefore, crossed by fields of tension; here the law is the tool of determining justice. In the time of legality principle, instead, the fields of tension of justice are absorbed in the political decision, which produces the statute law, and the law, then, is reduced to being a mere tool of administering justice. The essay point out, first of all, the fields of tension that have been at the basis of the dynamics of determining justice; then it will be analysed how the order layout of the trial conforms to this original connotation of facere iustitiam; thereafter, concentrate on the task that, in that context, is performed by the judge, concluding with a reflection upon the systematic framework where the new perspective of administering justice emerges...|$|E

This is the belief of the American critic Richard Chase, noted {{for his work on}} myths and mythological themes in English and American literature. Whether or not Chase is right must emerge from the chapters which follow. The purpose will be {{to examine the effects of}} the use of myths and mythological patterns on Eliot's work in general, rather than to annotate individual mythological allusions. Simply to recognise an allusion is to raise a question, not to answer one: for we have then to decide what the writer hope to achieve by its use, and whether or not he has succeeded. Unless they lead on to such questions, lists of sources contribute little to our understanding of a work. Far more important than incidental allusions are the mythological themes and patterns on the larger scale, which reveal themselves in recurrent allusions and in basic patterns of symbolism. Again, merely to recognise such a pattern is inadequate: in every case a discovery of its function in both the poem's (or play's) structure and the poet's technique should be our main concern. [...] . Eliot himself has made it clear that in his case the use of myths and mythological patterns has often been a fully conscious, even self-conscious process. Therefore we may apply to his work the questions mention by Norman: what functions the myths fulfil within individual works; and why Eliot uses them in the first place. This last question leads us back to a more fundamental one; why do many writers, especially modern ones, use myths 'in the first place'? The problem involves discussion of the relation between myths and literature and of the nature of myths themselves, this forms the material of the first chapter. The other chapters will deal with some of Eliot's works, attempting to explain and analyse his use of myths in them, and to illustrate its importance in each case...|$|E
40|$|Scholars have {{suggested}} that landscape become the main <b>ordering</b> <b>device</b> {{in the development of}} the built environment. Traditional methods of urban planning have categorized landscape as a cosmetic application, the purpose of which is to beautify the urban environment after the planning and development phases. The problems associated with globalization and rapid urbanization at present includes the commoditization of urban form. As a result of this trend, many cities are becoming less and less distinguishable from one another, as urban form is generated without considering the particularities of site and context. The lack of a more specific understanding of a site in its environmental, social and cultural dimensions, has led to the phenomenon of 2 ̆ 2 universal 2 ̆ 2 urban form. Landscape has new found relevance in contemporary urbanism becoming the medium that defines urban form; inserting the built environment within the context of complex natural, social and cultural environments. Landscape has the potential to design relationships between dynamic environmental processes and urban form, and become more of a functional system. In the island of Trinidad there exists the opportunity to explore the potential of landscape as a driver of urban form. The island is currently experiencing rapid urbanization and dynamic growth due to a boost in the economy, and an unprecedented government agenda to take the island to a developed nation status by the year 2020. Due to this emerging urbanity, there is the need to implement urban development approaches that protect the environmental integrity of the island, and preserve the social and cultural influences that give identity to the island. The investigation led to the development of a landscape infrastructure that is implemented in an effort to achieve sustainable urban development and preserve the natural integrity of the site. Through an in-depth analysis of the landscape, identifying the natural, social and cultural processes occurring, a plan of intervention is developed that is integrated with the dynamics of the site, and serves as an example of the potential of landscape in urbanism...|$|E

Lexicography has a practical component, i. e. the writing of dictionaries, and a theoretical component. The formulation of a general theory of lexicography has mostly been directed at printed dictionaries. The emergence of e-lexicography has confronted lexicographers with the option to devise a new and independent theory for online lexicography, resulting in two separate theories, or to adapt the existing theory by broadening its scope to include e-dictionaries. This would improve the strength of such a general theory of lexicography. In this paper the latter approach has been adopted. One of the focal points in a general theory of lexicography is the different dictionary structures. This paper focuses on adaptations for the transfer from printed to e-dictionaries with regard to {{only one of these}} lexicographic structures, i. e. the macrostructure. In an introductory section an overview is presented of some developments in theoretical lexicography and the task facing modern-day theoretical lexicographers to decide whether structures devised for printed dictionaries can be maintained in e-dictionaries and whether existing terminology still suffices. A brief account is then given of macrostructures in printed dictionaries and some underlying theoretical approaches. Various interpretations of the concept of the macrostrucure are indicated. Different types of macrostructures are discussed. Within the category of alphabetical macrostructures the need for an access alphabet is emphasised. Subtypes of macrostructural procedures like nesting and niching are discussed and illustrated. Reference is also made to their possible occurrence in e-dictionaries. Three major typological criteria of macrostructures, i. e. the ordering of macrostructural elements, the existence of external data-accessibility and the class membership of microstructural elements are mentioned and it is indicated that the focus will be on only one of these criteria, i. e. the ordering of macrostructural elements. Besides the main macrostructure, emphasis is also placed on article stretches as immediate constituents of macrostructures. The paper then focuses on e-dictionaries and within this category only on online dictionaries and not on CD-ROM dictionaries. It is stated and illustrated that e-dictionaries often seem to have no macrostructural <b>ordering</b> <b>device.</b> However, analysing and discussing different access possibilities in e-dictionaries to reach the required lemma it is shown that albeit that e-dictionaries do not display a traditional macrostructure as <b>ordering</b> <b>device</b> and as an instrument to ensure the lexicographic coverage of the subject matter of a given dictionary, there are various other ordering structures. Looking at the use of alphabet bars to guide the user to article stretches the paper shows how existing e-dictionaries do not only use article stretches and partial article stretches to order lemmata but they also employ lemma stretches and partial lemma stretches. Users have the option to employ a rapid access to a desired lemma, a procedure that does not rely on any macrostructural ordering. They also have the option to use a longer version of the access process and reach their target lemma via a browsing function that allows them to page through a dictionary or via alphabet bars and article stretches. This establishes the poly-accessibility of e-dictionaries. The use of alphabet bars is an innovative feature of e-dictionaries. An alphabet bar is a point of departure of a consultation process and also a starting point to reach all microstructural elements in an ordered and systematic way. Prevailing e-dictionaries use article and lemma stretches in different ways to enhance the access process. As is the case in printed dictionaries provision is also made for functional partial article and lemma stretches that cluster articles or lemmata in accordance with criteria of the genuine purpose of a given dictionary. It is shown that e-lexicography does utilise a range of features typical of macrostructures. The use of article and lemma stretches is enhanced and expanded, and along with alphabet bars, they are the major ordering structures of many e-dictionaries. As ordering structures they also play an important role to satisfy the criterion of external data-accessibility. Publishers' Versio...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} 30 years, subwavelength {{gratings}} {{have been developed}} and produced as highly secured Diffractive Optical Variable Image Devices (DOVIDs). They allowed new distinct optical effects and dramatically lowered DOVIDs counterfeiting. In particular, subwalength gratings coated with a high refractive index dielectric are well-known and mass-produced to secure documents, such as the Diffractive Identification Devices (DIDs). These submicronic gratings are called Zero <b>Order</b> <b>Devices</b> or Filters (ZOD, ZOF) or diffractive microstructures designed for Zero-order read-out. Similar structures are called Resonant Waveguide Gratings (RWG) or Resonant Leaky Mode Waveguides, when optimized for different purposes. A study using time-resolved optical simulations can demonstrate and quantify how light is coupled and propagation in DIDs structure when observed across the gratings (in collinear incidence). The leaky resonant modes of the RWG are playing {{a significant role in}} the appearance of DIDs in collinear incidence, which has practical impacts on the engineering of such security elements. From the learning of such non-local light interactions in DIDs, new optically variable effects can be designed and produced by using light transport in RWG. As an example, multi-frequency RWGs can be designed to couple light for different colors and polarizations and to outcouple them away from the specular configuration typical to the Zero <b>Order</b> <b>Devices.</b> As a further step, we present new structures able to couple light in the substrates or in selected layers of security documents or labels, embling waveguiding light in these layers. These optical couplers enable selective light transport at a macroscopic scale using total internal reflection in the volume of the substrates, while being compatible with current roll-to-roll methods...|$|R
40|$|How {{political}} authority and legitimacy are sustained in societies marked by socio-economic inequality and political exclusion is a long-standing preoccupation {{in the social}} sciences. Since {{the end of its}} civil war in 2002, Angola has often been cited as a paradigmatic case of such ‘illiberal peacebuilding’; of successful post-war transition to economic recovery and formal, political liberalisation, closely managed and tightly controlled by a ‘neoauthoritarian’, dominant-party regime. Based on 12 months of fieldwork in Luanda, this thesis offers an empirically and analytically innovative perspective that balances the ‘Africa rising’ narrative pervading mainstream media reports of post-war Angola, and complicates the clientelist account of Angolan politics that predominates academic literature. It does so by privileging an ethnographic approach rooted in urban life, encompassing social strata commonly studied separately. This seeks to delocalize the anthropological gaze and capture the radical social and spatial mobility of everyday life in Luanda. By working through the emic notion of the ‘system’, this thesis pays attention to both material practices and symbolic repertoires mobilised in the co-production of the political. For Angolans the ‘system’ is simultaneously a moral <b>ordering</b> <b>device,</b> a critique, and a mode d’emploi for their current political and socio-economic environment. It is characterised by multiple internal tensions: between the stasis and speed of urban life; blockages and mobility; the past and the future; ‘memory work’ and selective amnesia; and between fear and hope; and the affects and aspirations produced by ‘power’. Through detailed analysis of the practices through which people ‘work the system’, and of the political imaginaries and discursive repertoires that ‘make the system work’, the thesis looks at the myriad processes through which relationships between ‘power’ and ‘the people’ are constantly remade, renegotiated, and dialogically constructed. The analytical value of this notion of the ‘system’ is that it avoids reproducing a simplistic distinction between ‘state’ and ‘society’. By revealing the multiple linkages between these two spheres, we can think beyond ‘resistance’ and ‘complicity’, drawing out a more subtle account of hegemony, beyond the ‘cultivation of consent’ by the dominant. Examining the ‘functioning’ of ‘the system’ through the eyes of its ‘users’, the thesis therefore builds upon, and extends anthropology’s critique of dominance as something ‘produced’ by a group of select individuals, and investigates instead what it means and how it feels to live in and be part of such a polity. Its chapters explore the interweaving strands that make up this complex, mutually dependent relationship: history and the disjunctures between official and affective memories, ideas of racial and class identities, the idioms of kinship, and the practices and symbolisms of money-making. However, instead of reifying notions of ‘memory’, ‘tradition’, ‘identity’ or ‘corruption’ as analytical concepts, the thesis shows how social actors mobilise and modify these idioms in everyday interactions with ‘power’. Both in practice and in imagination, this ‘New Angola’ is constituted as essentially urban, upwardly mobile and aspirational, with rural areas left ‘behind’. Thus Luanda epitomises both a lived reality and a political project that stands for the entire country, as well as ‘laboratory of the global’, offering new insights into the politics of the everyday in dominant-party regimes in the 21 st century...|$|E
