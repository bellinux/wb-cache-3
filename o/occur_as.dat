5|$|Brachytherapy {{for breast}} or skin cancer may cause scar tissue to form around the {{treatment}} area. In {{the case of}} breast brachytherapy, fat necrosis may <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> a result of fatty acids entering the breast tissues. This can cause the breast tissue to become swollen and tender. Fat necrosis is a benign condition and typically occurs 4–12 months after treatment and affects about 2% of patients.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{for skin}} cancer {{may result in}} a {{shedding}} of the outer layers of skin (desquamation) around the area of treatment in the weeks following therapy, which typically heals in 5–8 weeks. If the cancer is located on the lip, ulceration may <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> a result of brachytherapy, but usually resolves after 4–6 weeks.|$|E
5|$|Cerebellar atrophy {{has been}} {{observed}} in many other neurological disorders including Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, essential tremor, progressive myoclonus epilepsy, and Niemann–Pick disease.

5|$|During winter, {{it often}} makes short {{distance}} movements, and some birds move into parts of western Pakistan and an adjoining corner of Iran, and less commonly north-western Gujarat, India. Longer movements may <b>occur,</b> <b>as</b> suggested by a possible sighting in the United Arab Emirates in November 2000.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{given that}} the way {{airborne}} ash is deposited after an eruption is strongly influenced by the meteorological conditions, a certain variation of the ash type will <b>occur,</b> <b>as</b> a function of distance to the volcano or time elapsed from eruption. The ash from Mount St. Helens is no exception, and hence the ash properties have large variations.|$|E
5|$|In COPD, it {{may take}} longer to breathe out than to breathe in. Chest {{tightness}} may occur but is not common and {{may be caused by}} another problem. Those with obstructed airflow may have wheezing or decreased sounds with air entry on examination of the chest with a stethoscope. A barrel chest is a characteristic sign of COPD, but is relatively uncommon. Tripod positioning may <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> the disease worsens.|$|E
50|$|Fluorapatite as {{a mineral}} {{is the most}} common {{phosphate}} mineral. It <b>occurs</b> widely <b>as</b> an accessory mineral in igneous rocks and in calcium rich metamorphic rocks.

It <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> a residual mineral in lateritic soils.|$|R
50|$|Valleriite {{occurs in}} dunites and chromitites {{replacing}} chalcopyrite in Cyprus. In Phalaborwa, South Africa it <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> replacement of magnetite in a carbonatite. It <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> replacements of copper and nickel phases in serpentinites and other altered ultramafic rocks.|$|R
50|$|It <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> a {{precipitate}} around volcanic fumaroles and solfataras. It also <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> an alteration in {{argillaceous sediments}} or coal beds which contain oxidizing sulfide minerals (pyrite or marcasite).

One of New Zealand's only two native species of non-marine mammal, the long-tailed bat, lives in small numbers within the forests, and several species of lizard are also found locally, including the southern forest gecko.|$|E
5|$|Pathogenic {{micro-organisms}} include bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They kill or debilitate {{their host}} and are relatively host-specific. Various microbial insect diseases occur naturally, {{but may also}} be used as biological pesticides. When naturally occurring, these outbreaks are density-dependent in that they generally only <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> insect populations become denser.|$|E
5|$|SAH may <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> {{a result}} of a head injury or spontaneously, usually from a {{ruptured}} cerebral aneurysm. Risk factors for spontaneous cases included high blood pressure, smoking, family history, alcoholism, and cocaine use. Generally, the diagnosis can be determined by a CT scan of the head if done within six hours. Occasionally a lumbar puncture is also required. After confirmation further tests are usually performed to determine the underlying cause.|$|E
50|$|Portlandite {{occurs in}} a variety of environments. At the type {{location}} in Northern Ireland it <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> an alteration of calc-silicate rocks by contact metamorphism of larnite-spurrite. It <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> fumarole deposits in the Vesuvius area. In Jebel Awq, Oman it <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> precipitates from an alkaline spring emanating from ultramafic bedrock. In the Chelyabinsk coal basin of Russia it is produced by combustion of coal seams and similarly by spontaneous combustion of bitumen in the Hatrurim Formation of the Negev desert in Israel and the Maqarin area, Jordan. It also occurs in the manganese mining area of Kuruman, Cape Province, South Africa in the Kalahari Desert where it <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> large crystals and masses.|$|R

5|$|Seizure {{prediction}} {{refers to}} attempts to forecast epileptic seizures {{based on the}} EEG before they <b>occur.</b> <b>As</b> of 2011, no effective mechanism to predict seizures has been developed. Kindling, where repeated exposures to events that could cause seizures eventually causes seizures more easily, {{has been used to}} create animal models of epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|Seizures {{may also}} <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> a {{consequence}} of other health problems; if they occur right around a specific cause, such as a stroke, head injury, toxic ingestion or metabolic problem, they are known as acute symptomatic seizures and are in the broader classification of seizure-related disorders rather than epilepsy itself.|$|E
5|$|Several {{complications}} can <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> {{a result}} of SCSFLS including decreased cranial pressure, brain herniation, infection, blood pressure problems, transient paralysis, and coma. The primary and most serious complication of SCSFLS is spontaneous intracranial hypotension, where pressure in the brain is severely decreased. This complication leads to the hallmark symptom of severe orthostatic headaches.|$|E
