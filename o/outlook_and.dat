5|$|As {{successful}} self-determination movements {{spread throughout}} Africa after World War II, many Mozambicans became progressively nationalistic in <b>outlook,</b> <b>and</b> increasingly {{frustrated by the}} nation's continued subservience to foreign rule. For the other side, many enculturated indigenous Africans who were fully integrated into the Portugal-ruled social organization of Portuguese Mozambique, in particular those from the urban centres, reacted to the independentist claims {{with a mixture of}} discomfort and suspicion. The ethnic Portuguese of the territory, which included most of the ruling authorities, responded with increased military presence and fast-paced development projects.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the game}} begins, each player creates their player {{character}} and records the details (described below) on a character sheet. First, a player determines their character's ability scores, which consist of Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each {{edition of the}} game has offered differing methods of determining these statistics. The player then chooses a race (species) such as human or elf, a character class (occupation) such as fighter or wizard, an alignment (a moral and ethical <b>outlook),</b> <b>and</b> other features to round out the character's abilities and backstory, which have varied in nature through differing editions.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century Jacobite Risings, Orkney {{was largely}} Jacobite in its sympathies. At {{the end of}} the 1715 rebellion, a large number of Jacobites who had fled north from {{mainland}} Scotland sought refuge on Orkney and were helped on to safety in Sweden. In 1745, the Jacobite lairds on the islands ensured that Orkney remained pro-Jacobite in <b>outlook,</b> <b>and</b> was a safe place to land supplies from Spain to aid their cause. Orkney was the last place in the British Isles that held out for the Jacobites and was not retaken by the British Government until 24 May 1746, over a month after the defeat of the main Jacobite army at Culloden.|$|E

5|$|However, many of Quwatli's {{generation}} were unimpressed with Faisal's leadership skills, {{and were}} drawn to a republican, rather than monarchist, view of governance. Furthermore, they were suspicious of Faisal, and his brother Abdullah's ties with the British. On 15 April 1919 they founded a loose coalition {{under the name of}} al-Istiqlal Party ("Independence Party"). The party had a pan-Arab, secular, anti-British and anti-Hashemite <b>outlook</b> <b>and</b> attracted mostly youth activists from the elite classes. Well-known members, other than Quwatli, included Adil Arslan, Nabih al-Azmeh, Riad al-Sulh, Saadallah al-Jabiri, Ahmad Qadri, Izzat Darwaza and Awni Abd al-Hadi. Although ostensibly working for the government, Quwatli devoted his efforts to nationalist activities outside the government's auspices. In addition to al-Istiqlal, he was {{also a member of the}} Palestinian-led Arab Club's Damascus branch.|$|E
5|$|The Reformation brought {{changes in}} <b>outlook</b> <b>and</b> artistic {{expression}} as secular and landscape imagery overtook biblical scenes. Sacred imagery {{was shown in}} a didactic and moralistic manner, with religious figures becoming marginalized and relegated to the background. Pieter Bruegel the Elder, {{one of the few}} who followed Bosch's style, is an important bridge between the Early Netherlandish artists and their successors. His work retains many 15th-century conventions, but his perspective and subjects are distinctly modern. Sweeping landscapes came to the fore in paintings that were provisionally religious or mythological, and his genre scenes were complex, with overtones of religious skepticism and even hints of nationalism.|$|E
5|$|When the NHL resumed for an {{abbreviated}} 2012–13 season, Oates and the Capitals struggled initially and won {{only two of}} their first 11 games.

Oates' players praised his positive <b>outlook</b> <b>and</b> willingness {{to work closely with}} them as a primary reasons why the team was able to turn its season around. The Capitals were defeated {{in the first round of}} the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs, however, losing to the New York Rangers in seven games.|$|E

5|$|A {{precocious}} student, Durkheim {{entered the}} École Normale Supérieure (ENS) in 1879, at his third attempt. The entering class that year {{was one of}} the most brilliant of the nineteenth century and many of his classmates, such as Jean Jaurès and Henri Bergson, would go on to become major figures in France's intellectual history. At the ENS, Durkheim studied under the direction of Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges, a classicist with a social scientific <b>outlook,</b> <b>and</b> wrote his Latin dissertation on Montesquieu. At the same time, he read Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer. Thus Durkheim became interested in a scientific approach to society very early on in his career. This meant the first of many conflicts with the French academic system, which had no social science curriculum at the time. Durkheim found humanistic studies uninteresting, turning his attention from psychology and philosophy to ethics and eventually, sociology. He obtained his agrégation in philosophy in 1882, though finishing next to last in his graduating class owing to serious illness the year before.|$|E
5|$|Deflated by his situation, Nguyễn Ánh asked Pigneau {{to appeal}} for French aid, and allowed Pigneau {{to take his}} son Nguyễn Phúc Cảnh with him {{as a sign of}} good faith. This came about after Nguyễn Ánh had {{considered}} enlisting English, Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish assistance. Pigneau advised against Nguyễn Ánh's original plan to seek Dutch aid from Batavia, fearing that the support of the Protestant Dutch would hinder the advancement of Catholicism. Pigneau left Vietnam in December, arriving in Pondicherry, India in February 1785 with Nguyễn Ánh's royal seal. Nguyễn Ánh had authorized him to make concessions to France in return for military assistance. The French administration in Pondicherry, led by acting governor Coutenceau des Algrains, was conservative in <b>outlook</b> <b>and</b> resolutely opposed intervention in southern Vietnam. To compound the already complex situation, Pigneau was denounced by Spanish Franciscans in the Vatican, and he sought to transfer his political mandate to Portuguese forces. The Portuguese had earlier offered Nguyễn Ánh 56 ships to use against the Tây Sơn.|$|E
5|$|On April4, 2015, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued their Day 6 {{severe weather}} outlook, {{highlighting}} a substantial and widespread risk for severe weather from southeastern Oklahoma to northeastern Illinois valid for April9. This threat area was maintained in the Day 5 <b>outlook</b> <b>and</b> narrowed to a corridor from southern Missouri into northern Illinois in the Day 4 outlook. On April7, a Day 3 Enhanced risk was issued across most of Illinois, eastern Missouri, and small portions of adjacent states. No further {{changes to the}} threat level were made, although the Enhanced risk was significantly expanded late on April8 to include portions of the southern Great Lakes, lower Ohio Valley, Ozark Plateau, and Arklatex region. Around midday on April9, the SPC issued a 10% hatched tornado threat area across much of northern Illinois and small portions of nearby states, signifying the potential for several tornadoes, of which one or two {{had the potential to}} be strong (EF2 or stronger on the Enhanced Fujita scale).|$|E

5|$|Composer Yoshihiro Ike infused {{the music}} with the sorrow {{borne by the}} karas, and the {{atmosphere}} conveyed by the background. Ike obliged the team's request for Japanese flavored music, and studied kabuki tunes accompanying actors as they strike their , a picturesque pose to establish their character. He planned to use taikos (Japanese drums) to further enhance the music, but felt the show had taken on an international <b>outlook</b> <b>and</b> discarded the notion. He wanted his music to match {{the quality of the}} show, and refrained from composing them until he had watched the pre-dubbed version of the first episode. He composed most of his music as he watched the pre-dubbed episodes to synchronize their tempo and dynamics with the action in the show. He chose Prague Symphony Orchestra to perform the main theme because he felt the background of their city and its people suited the character of Karas. Other departments also took extraordinary measures in producing the show. The sound crew procured a Nissan Skyline GT-R and recorded its engine noise for several runs. These were used for the tunnel chase scenes which involved a hand-drawn 1972–77 Skyline. The editing team took the additional step of editing cels post-voice recording to ensure lip movements were in synch with the voices. These extra work and the hybrid 2D-3D approach inflated the budget of the production to three times the usual amount spent on an original video animation.|$|E
