40|$|The <b>Organisation</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Footprint</b> (OEF) is a multi-criteria {{measure of}} the {{environmental}} performance of a goods/services-providing Organisation from a life cycle perspective. OEF studies are produced for the overarching purpose of seeking to reduce the environmental impacts associated with organisational activities, taking into account supply chain activities (from extraction of raw materials, through production and use, to final waste management). The Organisations involved include companies, public administrative entities, non-profit organisations and other bodies. OEFs are complimentary to other instruments that focus on specific sites and thresholds. This document provides guidance on how to calculate an OEF, {{as well as how}} to create sector-specific methodological requirements for use in <b>Organisation</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Footprint</b> Sector Rules (OEFSRs). nrpages: 148 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{presented}} EC <b>Organisation</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Footprint</b> (OEF) measures {{environmental impacts}} of organisations based on a life cycle approach to ensure no important issues are overlooked both throughout the value chain and regarding relevant environmental areas. It is responding to various policy requests to “establish a common methodological approach to enable Member States {{and the private sector}} to assess, display and benchmark the environmental performance of products, services and companies based on a comprehensive assessment of environmental impacts over the life-cycle ('environmental footprint') ”. Methods: The OEF provides the possibility for a more “top down” approach versus a product related approach like the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF), making data collection easier and requiring less effort. The ongoing three year pilot phase ending 2016 will explore the possibilities to develop more specific <b>Organisation</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Footprint</b> Sector Rules (OEFSRs). Results and discussion: The <b>Organisation</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Footprint</b> Sector Rules (OEFSRs) will lead to increased specificity, relevance and robustness of the assessments {{while at the same time}} striving for simplifications versus the OEF general guide. Simplification can be achieved e. g. by pre-identifying relevant life cycle stages, purchased products and environmental impacts on a sector specific level, focusing the work on what matters most. Conclusions: The three year pilot phase is a true pilot, especially for the OEF and OEFSR developments as far less experience is available compared to the assessment of products. This also and especially applies to the question if and how far comparability between organisations within the same sector providing similar products and services to society can be achieved. Considerations on whether to take any policy action is expected to take place in 2017 - 18 based on the result of the pilots and their peer review and evaluationJRC.

40|$|Purpose The European Commission (EC) has {{developed}} a reference method for <b>organisation</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>footprinting</b> (OEF) in support of improving the sustainability of production and consumption. This methodological development was guided by four core criteria. Specifically, it was deemed necessary that the method provides for a (1) multi-criteria, (2) life cycle-based approach that considers all organisational and related activities across the supply chain, (3) provides for reproducibility and comparability over flexibility, and (4) ensures physically realistic modelling. Methods Here, we review a subset of existing <b>organisation</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>footprinting</b> methods. We evaluate key areas of convergence (very limited!) and divergence between these methods, {{and the extent to}} which the methodological specifications they provide satisfy the four aforementioned criteria for the EC OEF method. On this basis, we specify where and why the EC OEF method necessarily diverges from and/or goes beyond the reviewed methods. Results and discussion We found little consistency between the reviewed methods, and few instances where our four criteria for the EC OEF method were satisfied. We specify the methodological norms for the EC OEF method for, among other things, definition of the unit of analysis (the organisation) and reference flow; organisation and analytical boundaries; cut-off criteria; impact categories and models; allocation solutions; and data quality. We further provide a rationale for each norm, in particular why they diverge from the various options presented in the reviewed methods. Conclusions In order to satisfy the four core criteria, the EC OEF method diverges from/goes beyond the reviewed methods in a variety of important respects. We suggest that the end result represents a significant advance in the standardization of life cycle-based <b>organisation</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>footprinting.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

To support EU {{environmental}} policies based on Life Cycle approach, the European Commission launched the “European Platform on Life Cycle Assessment (EPLCA). ” The platform aims at providing coherent and quality-assured life cycle data, methods, and studies {{as well as}} information about developers and suppliers of LCA dedicated software and databases (DB), and service providers. The LCA Resources Directory (RD), aims to offer a sharing platform for information related to software and database developers/suppliers, and service providers within the LCA community, there is also a repository for studies and documents with specific templates allowing to upload studies on e. g. Product and <b>Organisation</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Footprint,</b> Ecodesign, EPD and related Category Rules/Criteria. Recently a new tool has been added to the Resource Directory, i. e. the Reviewer Registry, would provide a list of qualified (i. e. with different levels of compliance for Life Cycle based methods) reviewers from different countries/sectors. The Reviewer Registry is a tool designed to provide information about reviewers concerning their expertise, knowledge and other relevant info. It helps the users to identify potential appropriate reviewers for their LCA studies. Based on the info provided, the tool assigns a score (now based on International reference Life Cycle Data system (ILCD) handbook, and Environmental Footprint (EF) requirements).

The Reviewers will be sortable by sectorial skills and relevance to specific LC-based methods (E. g. Environmental Footprint, ILCD, etc.). The level of experience of the registered reviewers/teams will be displayed, and some information may be also cross linked within the RD, such as publications or reports uploaded by the reviewer or his team on the "Documents and Studies" section. Others improvements are forseen on the existing sections, for instance in the "Dcouments and Studies" section some new templates may be developed according to the needs of other EU institutions, dealing with LCA or LCI datasets, in different sectors.

40|$|The Environmental Footprint (EF), {{launched}} by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre in close cooperation with Directorate-General for the Environment, gives specific guidance for comprehensive, scientifically-sound and consistent environmental assessment of products and organisations. The EF rules are reported in two guidance documents: one applicable to all goods and services, the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) guide, and one to organisations, the <b>Organisation</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Footprint</b> (OEF) guide. The principal aim of the EF guides is to ensure science-based decision support for industry and policy. To make the general-level EF rules more relevant and applicable to specific product categories and sectors the EF guides provide requirements to develop so called PEF Category Rules (PEFCRs) and OEF Sectoral Rules (OEFSRs). PEFCRs and OEFSRs are seen as crucial especially for consistent and robust business-to-business (B 2 B) and business-to-consumer (B 2 C) communication intended {{to be used for}} comparisons. The focus of this paper is on the PEFCRs. It highlights the key challenges in the process to develop PEFCRs and takes into account amongst others recent developments led by the US EPA in this area. When developing PEFCRs, the appropriate scope of the product category needs to be defined sufficiently broad to enable meaningful comparisons of products providing the same function on the one side, while remaining focused enough to be manageable from a process point of view on the other side. Different approaches can be used such as 1) a need-based approach 2) a functional approach and 3) a material-based approach. Each of these approaches has pros and cons which are also discussed in this contribution. An example of a very wide product group is the food products. The ENVIFOOD protocol of the European Food Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) Round Table was developed to be also in line with the PEF and can serve as a starting point to develop PEFCRs for food and food packaging defining several product categories and related PEFCRs below the level of the ENVIFOOD protocol.

The LCA Resources Directory (RD), has been recently improved, in order to allow the users to register and self-manage their own information, while in the previous version, as regards the contributor’s (i. e. developers, suppliers and service providers) section, the entries were managed from the JRC staff only. Significant changes have been also made in terms of content, the new RD includes some templates allowing to upload new types of studies (i. e. Product and <b>Organisation</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Footprint,</b> Ecodesign, EPD and related Category Rules/Criteria). Furthermore the old LCA template has been reviewed according to the new structure, and some new fields have been added. New fields have been also added in the tools and DB section, such as the level of compliance or the interoperability with the existing methods/formats (e. g. ILCD entry level, ILCD full compliance, PEF/OEF). After registering, the user is able to insert a set of metadata for the uploaded information, using the templates provided. The models for studies are composed of 54 to 62 fields, depending on the chosen method, while the template for the Category Rules/Criteria accounts 21 fields to be filled. The templates for tool and DB developers contains 21 and 14 fields, respectively. Once the tools and DBs are approved and published in the Resource Directory, the developers are also enabled to validate their suppliers, meaning than when a new user declare to supply the specific tool/DB, the developer is asked to approve it, before the final publication on the public RD. The searching tools have been improved as well, compared to the previous version that merely allowed the full text search. In the new version the users can run an advanced search both within the study and the contributors’ section, through the meta-data fields provided during the information upload. JRC.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the chainorganization {{environmental}} footprint (chain-OEF) approach by applying it to part of a pork production chain in Belgium. The approach is supposed to provide insight into the environmental impact of a specific production chain in an efficient manner by applying pragmatic data collection throughout the chain. This is achieved by allocating the environmental impact of each of the production sites to the product of interest using straightforward allocation rules. Methods: The cradle-to-gate (up to retail) environmental impact of pork was determined by life cycle assessment (LCA), in line with the product and <b>organisation</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>footprint</b> guidelines (PEF and OEF; European Commission 2013 b). Foreground data was gathered at a feed production site, two farmers, a slaughterhouse and a meat processing site. All foreground operations are part of the same pork production chain in Belgium. The chain was completed using background data from Ecoinvent v 3. 01 (Wernet et al. 2016), Agri-Footprint v 1. 0 (Blonk 2014), European Life Cycle Database v 3. 0, LCA Food Database (Nielsen et al. 2003) and OEF Sector Rules Retail (Humbert et al. 2015 b). The impact was quantified using the international reference life cycle data system (ILCD) midpoint method for 14 impact categories, but focussing on climate change. Results and discussion: The total carbon footprint of the cradle-to-gate pork production system equals 0. 46 kg CO 2 -eq. (100 g pork) − 1. This result is quite similar to that of earlier studies analysing the pork production chain: 0. 58 and 0. 57 kg CO 2 -eq. (100 g pork) − 1 (Bracquené et al. 2011, Agri-Footprint 2014). Most of the carbon footprint was caused by feed production and more specifically, by the feed ingredients and their transport. Grains, soy and palm oil have the largest impact contributions. The farms are responsible for most of the remaining impact. N 2 O and CH 4 emissions are the largest cause of greenhouse gas emissions at the farms. Also, in the other 13 considered impact categories, feed production and farming are responsible for more than half of the total impact, mostly followed by meat processing. Conclusions: Applying the chain-OEF approach in this study has shown that a chain LCA can be performed successfully and pragmatic data collection allows obtaining LCA results relatively fast, especially for small or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Whereas data availability was not such an issue, the main bottlenecks identified are data management and the link of LCA to other disciplines such as engineering, policy, etc. which could increase the added value of LCA studies...|$|E
40|$|After {{its debut}} in the European Commission’s Integrated Product Policy (COM (2003) 302) as the “best {{framework}} for assessing the potential environmental impacts of products”, Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) and Assessment (LCA) has become increasingly used in support of community policies and business. Focus has been primarily on establishing agreed methods, both within Europe and internationally. The EC’s European Platform on Life Cycle Assessment (EPLCA) has continued to address the equally essential issue of data availability, coherence, and quality assurance. LCA has become an important approach to boost smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in the EU. As an example, {{in the context of}} the Europe 2020 Flagship Initiative “A Resource Efficient Europe”, and the “Single Market for Green Products Communication” and related European Commission Recommendation for the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) Guide and the <b>Organisation</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Footprint</b> (OEF) Guides. These methodologies reflect a vital milestone in the aim to increase coherence and quality in the assessment of environmental performance of products and organisations. Other prominent applications include in support of the Waste Framework Directive, the Eco-design Directive, EU Ecolabel and EU GPP, the Raw Materials Initiative, the bio economy strategy, as well as providing a more advanced basis for indicators and targets accounting for the burdens of EU imports and exports to help focus policies and research funding. Life Cycle Thinking is essential in modern decision making in business and policy. Commonly implemented through Life Cycle Assessment, it is increasingly necessary to quantify the benefits and burdens associated with products, both goods and services, that occur in their supply chains, during use, as well as at the end-of-their lives. This helps to avoid the shifting of burdens between different geographic regions, generations and impacts. Within this framework, the EPLCA, developed by the JRC, together with DG-Environment, represents the reference point for data and methods essential to implementing Life Cycle based approaches. The EPLCA promotes the availability of data and information, with a focus on coherence and quality assurance. Although methodology development is advancing fast, the availability of coherent, quality-assured life cycle data and studies still represents a major challenge to mainstream the use of LCA and associated environmental footprint methods in business and in policy. To date, the EPLCA has facilitated several notable developments: -	The Life Cycle Data Network (LCDN); launched in early 2014, aims at providing a globally usable infrastructure for consistent and quality assured life cycle data. -	The European Reference Life Cycle Database (ELCD); comprises of Life Cycle emissions and resource consumption Inventory (LCI) data from front-running EU-level business associations and other sources for key materials, energy carriers, transport, and waste management, to be used as source for secondary data. -	The Resource Directory (RD); provides a structured repository for several types of life cycle-based documents and studies, as well as a world-wide list of life cycle support software packages and databases from suppliers/developers, and service providers. -	The Reviewer Registry (RR) : provides a list of potential reviewers for different LCA schemes, and automatically assess the eligibility of single reviewers and reviewers’ teams, according to different levels of compliance. This guide provides comprehensive instructions on how to utilize the Life Cycle Data Network (LCDN) for publishing LCA data. It summarizes how to orchestrate the various tools in order to guide the data developers through the entire process from generation of a dataset to publication on the LCDN. Further and more detailed documentation for the individual steps can be found in the annexes to this technical report. In principle, the following steps are required in order to publish data on the LCDN and therefore covered in this document: 1. 	Prepare data (export from an LCA modelling tool) 2. 	Technical validation of the data 3. 	Set up a node for participation in the LCDN. 4. 	Upload of the data to the node 5. 	Publication of the data on the LCDN Beyond that, a detailed guidance on how document different ILCD-EL aspects, in three commonly used LCA software in Europe (Namely: GaBi, OpenLCA and SimaPro), is also provided in this document. This document is providing some examples, taking into account some the above mentioned LCA software, because are the most commonly used and widespread in Europe, this does NOT imply any recommendation or endorsement from the JRC or the European Commission. An exemplary dataset was used to provide an overview and understanding of how to address some compliance issues, in different software. Some general guiding principles that apply to all of the software are summarized, along with a short review of discrepancies found when exporting the dataset in ILCD format using the individual LCA software.

Although methodology development is advancing fast, including the provision of authoritative requirements by the European Commission, the availability of coherent, quality-assured life cycle data and studies still represent a more major challenge to mainstream use of LCA and associated environmental footprint methods in business and in policy. To date, the European Platform has facilitated several notable developments: - The International Reference Life Cycle Data System Data Network (ILCD DN); to be launched in early 2014, aims at providing a globally usable infrastructure for consistent and quality assured life cycle data. - The European Reference Life Cycle Database (ELCD); comprises of Life Cycle emissions and resource consumption Inventory (LCI) data from front-running EU-level business associations and other sources for key materials, energy carriers, transport, and waste management, to be used as source for secondary data. - The International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) Handbook; is a series of technical guidance documents that provide practice-oriented guidance on LCA; providing a key input to the Environmental Footprint developments, as well as complementary support in relation to data and other application needs. - The Resource Directory (RD); provides a structured repository for several types of life cycle-based documents and studies, as well as a world-wide list of life cycle support software packages and databases from suppliers/developers, and service providers. - The Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) Forum; acts as reference point for scholars and practitioners to discuss and share experiences on methods, data, events, etc. This tool is expected to be revised and released as a structured online public forum in the near future, in order to facilitate topic-oriented information exchange. - The Advisory Groups with business stakeholders and software developers; aim at improving the usefulness of the European Platform in the EU and international context, towards the agreement on common strategies and harmonisation. Although a lot of work has been already done, there are still several bottlenecks preventing the Platform to effectively and efficiently meet the growing needs of policy makers and other stakeholders. Seeking for synergies among tools, improving transparency and consistency of data, and populating the ELCD and ILCD DN with new relevant data are just a few examples of further development necessities. This Roadmap provides an overview of what would be required to further improve and best position the European Platform on LCA in relation to a selection of key on-going EC policy support activities required to facilitate environmental sustainability. The Roadmap specifies a number of action proposals. These actions are differentiated in the Roadmap in terms of time frame (i. e. short-mid-term describing circa 3 years starting from 2014, while the longer-term perspective represents a vision for the future evolution). Based on the availability of resources, three scenarios have been delineated to undertake to various extents these actions. In short, the first scenario assumes minor changes to the current resource availability. This scenario would address only the most important needs, detected as transversal across the different EU projects and policies involved, including only the strictly necessary improvements. According to the second scenario, slightly increased investments will be needed. Given the current situation, this scenario seems to be the minimum-effort scenario to improve the Platform in a timely manner. This scenario entails, among others, the expansion of the data and information support tools needed to e. g. ensure the smooth implementation of the Environmental Footprint method; amongst other policy and business support needs of the community. With major additional investment into the Platform, very important goals could be achieved in a fast-track manner. Through this third scenario, the Platform could become the most important reference point for all the life cycle based activities in the EU, facilitating interactions among stakeholders, policy makers and practitioners, and creating synergies for data exchange between the European Commission, other EU institutions, member-states and other non-governmental organizations. edition: 1 nrpages: 67 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The <b>environmental</b> <b>footprint</b> {{of animal}} food {{production}} is considered several-fold {{greater than that of}} crops cultivation. Therefore, the choice between animal and vegetarian diets may have a relevant environmental impact. In such comparisons however, an often neglected issue is the nutritional value of foods. Previous estimates of nutrients’ <b>environmental</b> <b>footprint</b> had predominantly been based on either food raw weight or caloric content, not in respect to human requirements. Essential amino acids (EAAs) are key parameters in food quality assessment. We re-evaluated here the <b>environmental</b> <b>footprint</b> (expressed both as land use for production and as Green House Gas Emission (GHGE), of some animal and vegetal foods, titrated to provide EAAs amounts in respect to human requirements. Production of high-quality animal proteins, in amounts sufficient to match the Recommended Daily Allowances of all the EAAs, would require a land use and a GHGE approximately equal, greater o smaller (by only ± 1 -fold), than that necessary to produce vegetal proteins, except for soybeans, that exhibited the smallest footprint. This new analysis downsizes the common concept of a large advantage, in respect to <b>environmental</b> <b>footprint,</b> of crops vs. animal foods production, when human requirements of EAAs are used for reference...|$|R

40|$|While {{in recent}} years both <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> and {{planetary}} boundaries have gained tremendous popularity throughout the ecological and environmental sciences, their relationship remains largely unexplored. By investigating the roots and developments of <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> and planetary boundaries, this paper challenges {{the isolation of the}} two research fields and provides novel insights into the complementary use of them. Our analysis demonstrates that knowledge of planetary boundaries improves the policy relevance of <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> by providing a set of consensus-based estimates of the regenerative and absorptive capacity at the global scale and, in reverse, that the planetary boundaries framework benefits from well-grounded footprint models which allow for more accurate and reliable estimates of human pressure on the planet's environment. A framework for integration of <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> and planetary boundaries is thus proposed. The so-called footprint-boundary environmental sustainability assessment framework lays the foundation for evolving environmental impact assessment to environmental sustainability assessment aimed at measuring the sustainability gap between current magnitudes of human activities and associated capacity thresholds. As a first attempt to take advantage of <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> and planetary boundaries in a complementary way, there remain many gaps in our knowledge. We have therefore formulated a research agenda for further scientific discussions, mainly including the development of measurable boundaries in relation to footprints at multiple scales and their trade-offs, and the harmonization of the footprint and boundary metrics in terms of environmental coverage and methodological choices. All these points raised, in our view, will {{play an important role in}} setting practical and tangible policy targets for adaptation and mitigation of worldwide environmental unsustainability...|$|R

This paper sketches the <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> of water and energy use in food production systems. The main objective is to present an empirical application, to help identify the main pathways to reducing the footprints.

Further insights are gained through a review of the data published in pre eminent journals. Together the analysis indicates that boosting water productivity and improving energy use efficiency in crop production operations are the two possible pathways to reducing the <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> of water and energy inputs in food production.
