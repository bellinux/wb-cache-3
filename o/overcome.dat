40|$|I {{have argued}} that {{forgiveness}} paradigmatically involves <b>overcoming</b> moral anger, of which resentment is the central case. I have argued, as well, that forgiveness may involve <b>overcoming</b> any form of anger {{so long as the}} belief that you have been wrongfully harmed is partially constitutive of it, and that <b>overcoming</b> other negative emotions caused by a wrongdoer's misdeed may, given appropriate qualifications, count as forgiveness. Those qualifications indicate, however, significant differences between moral anger and other negative emotions; differences which {{must be taken into account}} when determining whether <b>overcoming</b> negative emotions other than moral anger count as forgiveness.

5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} {{has been}} more broadly described {{as the ability to}} adjust one’s thinking from old situations to new situations as well as the ability to <b>overcome</b> responses or thinking that have become habitual and adapt to new situations. As such, if one is able to <b>overcome</b> previously held beliefs or habits (when it is required for new situations) then they would be considered cognitively flexible. Lastly, the ability to simultaneously consider two aspects of an object, idea, or situation at one point in time refers to cognitive flexibility. According to this definition, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they can sort cards based on the color of the objects and type of objects on the card simultaneously. Similarly, cognitive flexibility has been defined as having the understanding and awareness of all possible options and alternatives simultaneously within any given situation.|$|E
