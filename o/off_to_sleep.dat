5|$|Soon after Vash's arrival, {{the station}} begins to {{experience}} similar power failures. In the meantime, Q appears to Vash, apparently infatuated with her. Q {{was the one}} who transported Vash to the Gamma Quadrant two years earlier, but now she wants nothing to do with him, much to Q's annoyance. When Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) asks Vash out for dinner, a jealous Q uses his powers to send Bashir <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Meanwhile, Quark (Armin Shimerman) arranges to auction off various items Vash has found in the Gamma Quadrant, including an unusual crystal that might fetch a high price.|$|E
5|$|David is revived {{and walks}} to the frozen Fairy statue, which collapses when he touches it. The Mecha use David’s {{memories}} to reconstruct the Swinton home and explain to him that they cannot make him human. However, David insists that they recreate Monica from DNA in the lock of hair. The Mecha warn David that the clone can only live for a day, and that the process cannot be repeated. David spends the next day with Monica and Teddy. Before she drifts <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> Monica tells David she has always loved him. Teddy climbs onto the bed and watches the two lie peacefully together.|$|E
25|$|Familiar {{examples}} of normal myoclonus include hiccups and hypnic jerks {{that some people}} experience while drifting <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Severe cases of pathologic myoclonus can distort movement and severely limit a person's ability to sleep, eat, talk, and walk. Myoclonic jerks commonly occur in individuals with epilepsy.|$|E

60|$|The journey {{seemed very}} long; and Lucy was really tired {{when she was}} put down at last in a big bed, nicely warmed for her, and with a bright fire in the room. As soon as she had had some beef-tea, she went <b>off</b> soundly <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> and only woke to drink tea, give the dolls their supper, and put them <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|R
25|$|Sleep {{myoclonus}} {{occurs during}} the initial phases of sleep, especially {{at the moment of}} dropping <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Some forms appear to be stimulus-sensitive. Some people with sleep myoclonus are rarely troubled by it, or need treatment. If it is a symptom of a more complex and disturbing sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome, it may require medical treatment. Myoclonus can be associated with patients with Tourette syndrome.|$|E
25|$|By this time, Barry was openly {{suffering}} {{from the effects of}} longstanding addictions to cocaine and alcohol; he would later admit that he lost control of his drug habit soon after being sworn in for a third term. His public appearances were marked by his glassy eyes and slurred speech. His aides began scheduling all of his daily events later and later in the day as he was arriving to work as late as lunchtime, and nodding <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> at his desk. His ability to function as mayor had become so impaired that even his closest associates urged him not to run again. They tried to create an endowed professorship for him at the University of the District of Columbia. In the wake of Barry's inattention, the city declined badly. Barry was watching Super Bowl XXI in Pasadena, California when a winter blizzard struck Washington in January 1987; city crews were accused of badly mishandling the road clearing, adversely affecting local businesses.|$|E
2500|$|Another anecdote recounts how while Seongcheol {{was staying}} in Mangwolsa in Dobong mountain, an old monk {{by the name}} of Chunseong refused to believe this. [...] He wanted to catch Seongcheol dozing <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> so spied on him {{secretly}} throughout one night. [...] But having witnessed the truth of the rumor, Chunseong was struck with amazement and himself started employing the technique. [...] It is said that the stress of the practice and the old age at which he started the technique caused all of his teeth to fall out later in life.|$|E

2500|$|During {{his years}} as patriarch of Haeinsa and as Supreme Patriarch of the Jogye order, Seongcheol's {{reputation}} kept growing. [...] Amongst monks, he was famous for being a very strict teacher, being called the tiger of Kaya mountain. [...] When monks would nod <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> during meditation, he would beat them with wooden sticks while yelling, [...] "Thief, pay for your rice!" [...] (referring to the donations of the lay, and the monks' debts to society and therefore his duty to practice to the utmost of his abilities).|$|E
2500|$|Chris's family {{contacts}} {{a medium}} who can see but not hear Chris, and they conduct a séance. Chris tries {{to communicate with}} them, but tires and goes <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> When he awakens, he is horrified to find himself staring at a figure of himself conversing with the family. The psychic is unknowingly feeding this figure some answers he expects to hear, unaware that he's not conversing with the real Chris. The novel later explains that the figure is the shedding of Chris's etheric body to release his spirit body, enabling him to ascend to Heaven, or [...] "Summerland." ...|$|E
2500|$|In chapter 20 verses 6 through 12 of The Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament, the {{accidental}} autodefenestration {{of a young}} man of Troas named Eutychus is recorded. [...] The Apostle Paul was travelling to Jerusalem and had stopped for 7 days in Troas. [...] While preaching in a third-story room late on a Sunday night to the local assembly of Christian believers, the young man Eutychus drifted <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> and fell out of the window in which he was sitting. [...] Interestingly, this incident is likely also the only recorded case of raising from death after fatal defenestration, as though Eutychus was taken up dead from the ground below, the Apostle Paul fell upon the body, embraced it, and then presented him alive to those present, whom the Bible indicates [...] "were not a little comforted."

60|$|Let me {{once more}} insist that this keeping up a {{conversation}} {{is a sign of}} insecurity, of want of confidence. All those who have had real friends know that when the friendship is assured the gabble ceases. You are not at the heart of your friend, if either of you cannot go <b>off</b> comfortably <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> in the other's presence. Speech was given us to make known our needs, and for imprecation, expostulation, and entreaty. This pitiful necessity we are under, upon social occasions, to say something--however inconsequent--is, I am assured, the very degradation of speech.|$|R
60|$|In the afternoon, Mr. Armstrong again dropped <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a quiet <b>sleep.</b> This {{time he was}} {{not holding}} his daughter's hand, {{and as soon as}} she saw that he was fairly off she stole out of the room, and finding the surgeon, asked if he would take her up to the ward where Sergeant Blunt was lying.|$|R
2500|$|Carlisle Cathedral has a fine set of 46 {{carved wooden}} choir stalls with misericords, which were {{installed}} in the early 15th century. [...] Misericords are hinged seats, [...] "constructed to keep the monks from falling asleep while at prayers," [...] and carved with numerous figures and creatures. Despite their purpose, the [...] "pillars supporting the canopies bear traces of having been burnt, by weary monks who dropped <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> {{in the midst of}} their interminable devotions while holding a lighted candle in their hands." [...] The misericords were made out of black oak, and their backs carved with scenes of the legends of St. Anthony the Hermit, St. Cuthbert, St. Augustine, and the twelve apostles, as well as mythical themes. The misericords of Carlisle include typical iconography of [...] "half-length angels, beasts deriving from the Bestiary, hybrid creatures, and narrative scenes, including the inverted world theme of the Woman beating a Man that no decent set of misericords could be without." ...|$|E
2500|$|They {{took the}} three {{children}} {{to the home of}} William Starck, a neighbor, for immediate care. Starck's daughter, Anna Starck Benjamin, who was 4½ years old at the time, remembered [...] "the sound of Hazel's outstretched arms as they brushed against the furniture as they brought her into the house, and took her into my parents' bedroom. The crackling sound as that of frozen laundry brought in off the clothes line in winter. Then I remember the crying, so much crying." [...] They worked over Hazel for hours, trying to revive her, but without success. Hazel's mother, Blanche, was brought to the Starck house after the searchers found the children and sat in a chair, rocking back and forth, while they tended to {{the three children}}. Throughout the night when the children were missing, she had been kept company by neighbors. At one point, she drifted <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> and said later that her daughter had come to her in a dream. In the dream, Hazel said, [...] "I was cold, Mama, but I'm not anymore." ...|$|E

6000|$|I wrote a {{meditation}} and a dream, [...] Hearing {{a little child}} sing in the street: [...] I leant upon his music as a theme, [...] Till it gave way beneath my heart's full beat [...] Which tried at an exultant prophecy [...] But dropped before the measure was complete-- [...] Alas, for songs and hearts! O Tuscany, [...] O Dante's Florence, is the type too plain? [...] Didst thou, too, only sing of liberty [...] As little children take up a high strain [...] With unintentioned voices, and break <b>off</b> [...] <b>To</b> <b>sleep</b> upon their mothers' knees again?

40|$|Since {{one-third of}} a smart phone’s battery energy is {{consumed}} by its WiFi interface, {{it is critical}} to switch the WiFi radio from its active or Constantly Awake Mode (CAM), which draws high power (726 mW with screen <b>off),</b> <b>to</b> its <b>sleep</b> or Power Save Mode (PSM), which consumes little power (36 mW). Applications like VoIP do not perform well under PSM mode however, due to their real-time nature, so the energy footprint is quite high. The challenge is to save energy while not affecting performance. In this paper we present SiFi: Silence prediction based WiFi energy adaptation. SiFi examines audio streams from phone calls and tracks when silence periods start and stop. This data is stored in a prediction model. Using this historical data, we predict the length of future silence periods and place the WiFi radio <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> during these periods. We implement the design on an Android Smart phone and acheive 40 % energy savings while maintaining high voice fidelity.

60|$|I awoke {{abruptly}} {{out of a}} {{dream of}} strange beasts, and found myself lying on my back. Probably every one knows that dismal, emotional dream from which one escapes, awake indeed, but strangely cowed. There was a curious taste in my mouth, a tired feeling in my limbs, a sense of cutaneous discomfort. I lay with my head motionless on my pillow, expecting that my feeling of strangeness and terror would pass away, and that I should then doze <b>off</b> again <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> But instead of that, my uncanny sensations increased. At first I could perceive nothing wrong about me. There was a faint light in the room, so faint {{that it was the}} very next thing to darkness, and the furniture stood out in it as vague blots of absolute darkness. I stared with my eyes just over the bedclothes.|$|R
50|$|Still lacking experience, Paulsen hitches {{his team}} {{up and goes}} on several more runs, {{resulting}} in numerous wrecks, some of which result in Paulsen losing his team and walking home by himself. (The dogs not only find their own way home, but return long before Paulsen.) After one particular late night run where Paulsen and his team encounter several skunks, with the expected results, Paulsen is relegated to sleeping in the kennel. He finds that sharing sleeping quarters with the dogs increases his bond with them, and even after the smell has worn <b>off</b> he continues <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> outside.|$|R

[...] "You've been dreaming of somebody, Mr. Delamayn. What's to do about a slate?" [...] Geoffrey looked eagerly round the room, and heaved a heavy breath of relief. [...] "I could have sworn she was staring at me over the dwarf pear-trees," [...] he said. [...] "All right, I know where I am now." [...] Perry (attributing the dream to nothing more {{important}} than a passing indigestion) administered some brandy and water, and left him <b>to</b> drop <b>off</b> again <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> He fretfully forbade the extinguishing of the light.

60|$|The drawing-room, {{to which}} we had now {{withdrawn}} {{for the rest of}} the evening, was on the ground-floor, and was of the same shape and size as the breakfast-room. Large glass doors at the lower end opened on to a terrace, beautifully ornamented along its whole length with a profusion of flowers. The soft, hazy twilight was just shading leaf and blossom alike into harmony with its own sober hues as we entered the room, and the sweet evening scent of the flowers met us with its fragrant welcome through the open glass doors. Good Mrs. Vesey (always the first of the party to sit down) took possession of an arm-chair in a corner, and dozed <b>off</b> comfortably <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> At my request Miss Fairlie placed herself at the piano.
