Theoretically square waves consist of odd harmonics only. In a class-D amplifier, the output filter blocks all harmonics; i.e., the harmonics see an <b>open</b> <b>load.</b> So even small currents in the harmonics suffice to generate a voltage square wave. The current is in phase with the voltage applied to the filter, but the voltage across the transistors is out of phase. Therefore, there is a minimal overlap between current through the transistors and voltage across the transistors. The sharper the edges, the lower the overlap.|$|E

40|$|Calibration and {{correction}} {{methods for}} the Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) {{are based on}} the fundamental assumption of the constant error model, which is independent of connected calibration standards and/or devices under test (DUT). Unfortunately, this assumption is not satisfied well for planar calibration standards fabricated by etching technology on soft substrates. An evaluation of the error model is affected especially by variations in the manufacturing process and also by the reproducibility of an assembly. In this paper, we propose error minimization by selecting the best combination of available calibration standards based on time domain reflection (TDR) measurement, which can also be obtained by the fourier transformation from the measured S-parameters. The proposed method was verified experimentally using short, <b>open,</b> <b>load</b> and thru (SOLT) standards fabricated on an FR 4 laminate substrate which achieves the essential reduction of the measurement error in the frequency range up to 15 GHz. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the advantages and}} challenges of strained silicon/silicon germanium (Si/SiGe) metal oxide on semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) from the mixed-signal perspective using electrical characterisation. It {{is divided into three}} main sections. The first section {{addresses the}} compatibility of strain engineering with other performance boosters like high k/metal gate stacks. The mixed-signal performance of strained SiGe pMOSFETs with hafnium silicate/titanium silicon-nitride (HfSiOx/TiSiN) gate stacks has beer using MOSFET electrical characterisation techniques. The strain induced performance enhancements usually reported at long gate lengths are shown to be reproducible at short gate lengths with some caveats. These caveats are that the challenges of effective channel length mismatch from strain-suppressed boron diffusion and source-drain parasitic resistances from unoptimized silicidation of SiGe are addressed. It is demonstrated that the enhancement in the <b>open</b> <b>load</b> voltage gain (self gain) of the SiGe devices compared with the Si control increases as the gate length is reduced. This is due to the lower lateral diffusion of the boron junction implants in compressively strained SiGe inducing better electrostatic integrity.

40|$|There will be {{explosive}} growth in wind power, solar, {{and other forms}} of non-traditional supplies of electricity. This is guaranteed by the politicians around the world, often through mandates or renewable portfolio standards. Some politicians have also enacted economic incentives, using their tax code and/or mandatory prices. But what is the value of intermittent electricity, such as that produced by wind generators, to the utility dispatchers, {{the men and women who}} oversee the minute to minute balancing of the supply of and demand for electricity? Unlike many commodities, utility dispatchers nominally don’t have an inventory of electricity to draw upon when wind generated electricity suddenly decreases. The lack of an inventory is also a problem when a sudden wind gust puts the utility dispatcher in the position of having a surplus. It is often as difficult to dump electricity as it is to suddenly generate electricity. If we are able to set a value for the intermittent deliveries of electricity, then there is an incentive for many more players to find physical solutions to the intermittency issues. One such solution might be storage systems.

40|$|With the {{availability}} of multi-port vector network analyzers, the need for automated, calibrated measurement facilities increases. In this contribution, a calibrationmeasurement unit is presented which realizes a repeatable automated calibration of the measurement setup {{as well as a}} user-friendly measurement of the device under test (DUT). In difference to commercially available calibration units, which are connected to the ports of the vector network analyzer preceding a measurement and which are then removed so that the DUT can be connected, the presented calibrationmeasurement unit is permanently connected to the ports of the VNA for the calibration {{as well as for the}} measurement of the DUT. This helps to simplify the calibrated measurement of complex scattering parameters. Moreover, a full integration of the calibration unit into the analyzer setup becomes possible. The calibration-measurement unit is based on a multiport switch setup of e. g. electromechanical relays. Under the assumption of symmetry of a switch, on the one hand the unit realizes the connection of calibration standards like one-port reflection standards and two-port through connections between different ports and on the other hand it enables the connection of the DUT. The calibration-measurement unit is applicable for two-port VNAs as well as for multiport VNAs. For the calibration of the unit, methods with completely known calibration standards like SOLT (short, <b>open,</b> <b>load,</b> through) as well as self-calibration procedures like TMR or TLR can be applied. © Author(s) 2008...|$|E

A single ASC produces approximately 80 We making this system advantageous for small distributed lunar science stations. The IPT consists of Sunpower, Inc., to provide the single ASC with a passive balancer, The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHUAPL) to design an engineering model Single Convertor Controller (SCC) for an ASC with a passive balancer, and NASA GRC to provide technical support to these tasks {{and to develop a}} simulated lunar lander test stand. The single ASC with a passive balancer, simulated lunar lander test stand, and SCC were delivered to GRC and were tested as a system. The testing sequence at GRC included SCC fault tolerance, integration, electromagnetic interference (EMI), vibration, and extended operation testing. The SCC fault tolerance test characterized the SCCs ability to handle various fault conditions, including high or low bus power consumption, total <b>open</b> <b>load</b> or short circuit, and replacing a failed SCC card while the backup maintains control of the ASC. The integrated test characterized the behavior of the system across a range of operating conditions, including variations in cold-end temperature and piston amplitude, including the emitted vibration to both the sensors on the lunar lander and the lunar surface. The EMI test characterized the AC and DC magnetic and electric fields emitted by the SCC and single ASC. The vibration test confirms the SCCs ability to control the single ASC during launch. The extended operation test allows data to be collected over a period of thousands of hours to obtain long term performance data of the ASC with a passive balancer and the SCC.

40|$|When new coaxial {{interfaces}} become available, it {{is important}} to validate their performance. The best {{way to do this is}} by using a calibration kit that eliminates the effects of adapters in the measurement. This article discusses the design and implementation of a TRM calibration kit for a ZMA interface. The ZMA interface is a high coupling force bayonet connector used in microwave applications up to 12. 4 GHz. The calibration kit is designed for a frequency band of 0. 045 to 12. 4 GHz. The systematic errors and the effect of adapters in network measurements are reviewed. The steps used when designing the calibration standards for the ZMA interface using the High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS ®) software from Ansoft Corp. are then described. One of the greatest challenges in characterizing new coaxial interfaces is to determine an accurate test configuration. When precision airlines are not available it is very difficult to obtain a true measurement of the device under test. It becomes necessary to design and implement calibration standards to eliminate the effect of adapters and validate the performance of the device. This article discusses the design of a TRM calibration kit for the ZMA interface. The design was performed with the aid of Ansoft HFSS simulation software to characterize and optimize the calibration standards. The ZMA interface is a high coupling force bayonet connector used in microwave applications. Although the ZMA connector can be optimized to work up to 22 GHz, current requirements ask for a calibration kit up to X-band. Its performance is comparable to an SMA connector up to 12. 4 GHz. 1 The TRM calibration is an alternative to the traditional two-port error correction that uses short, <b>open,</b> <b>load</b> and thru standards (SOLT). 2 The TRM offers equivalent accuracy and has the advantage that fewer and simpler standards are required. 2 – 3 The name TRM represents the three standards that are used in the calibration — thru, reflect and match.
