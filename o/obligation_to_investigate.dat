40|$|This paper {{examines}} the positive human rights obligations of states on whose territory private military and security companies (PMSCs) operate. It considers the <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> prevent human rights violations; the <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>investigate</b> violations, <b>to</b> prosecute their perpetrators {{and to provide}} reparations to the victims. The paper analyses the case-law and views of the monitoring bodies of the main universal and regional human rights instruments, applying it to the host state of PMSCs. This case-law confirms that the general duty to protect human rights is primarily conferred upon the state in whose territory violations may occur. The lack of institutional capacities often complicates or precludes compliance with these obligations. Moreover, military occupation {{or other forms of}} effective control exercised in the state’s territory by third states also affect the host state’s obligations and may give rise to extra-territorial application of human rights. The paper argues that the host state of a PMSC can nevertheless be held accountable for violation of a positive obligation, when human rights violations occur which do not fall within the scope of such effective control and where the institutional capacities are sufficiently developed to comply with at least some of these obligations. Such capacities vary among states and may evolve over time, such as in a transitional post-conflict phase. Therefore, host states of PMSCs should be aware of their obligations under human rights law and, to the extent possible, ensure compliance with these duties...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{addresses}} the positive human rights obligations of a hiring state {{with respect to}} {{violations of human rights}} by Private Military or Security Companies (PMSCs / contractors) that it employs, which arise from the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> prevent such violations, as well as the <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> legislate, <b>investigate,</b> and prosecute and punish. The contribution is limited to scenarios where PMSCs provide coercive services in a theatre of conflict. Examples include combat, guarding and protection of persons or property, or detention and interrogation. The analysis demonstrates that hiring states have numerous positive obligations under Human Rights Law that can be highly relevant to PMSC operations in situations of conflict, including duties to oversee, control, and where necessary physically prevent conduct likely to threaten the right to life or the prohibition of torture and cruel and inhuman treatment. Where violations have already occurred or have been alleged, the duty <b>to</b> <b>investigate,</b> prosecute and punish obligates states to provide for a structure facilitating the reporting of such allegations, to quickly and effectively follow up on them and to ensure that they are properly processed through the system of justice. These provisions can, for the most part, be extended to conduct of third persons and thus also to contractors providing coercive services, even where their conduct may not be attributable to the state...|$|R

40|$|Both in {{conflict}} and post-conflict situations, states increasingly rely on private military and security companies (PMSCs) to perform tasks {{which used to}} be carried out by their Military. Practice shows that employees of such private companies may become involved in incidents amounting to serious violations of human rights, such as the right to life and the freedom from torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. This paper examines the positive <b>obligations</b> of States <b>to</b> <b>investigate</b> serious human rights violations and to prosecute those responsible for such violations, deriving from international and regional human rights instruments, as well as their interpretation by the respective courts and monitoring bodies. It then considers how these <b>obligations</b> may apply <b>to</b> states who contract PMSCs; to States on whose territory these companies operate; and to the States where they are registered. It concludes that despite the absence of judicial practice specifically addressing PMSCs, the human rights bodies increasingly accept that the positive <b>obligations</b> of states <b>to</b> <b>investigate</b> and prosecute serious human rights violations also apply when States have effective control over the territory of another State; but also when they exercise a lesser degree of authority or control in a third State. It argues that a proportional relationship should be recognised between the extent of such authority or control exercised in a foreign State- including through the use of PMSCS-, {{and the degree to which}} the positive human rights <b>obligations</b> pertain <b>to</b> that State.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the performance of}} national courts {{in light of the}} expected division of labour between international and domestic jurisdictions in seeking accountability whenever international crimes are committed. The thesis proceeds from the normative assumption that states have a residual <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>investigating</b> and prosecuting perpetrators of international crimes, even after the ICC has intervened. The ICC can only proceed with a handful of investigations and prosecutions in each situation, leaving the bulk of the perpetrators to be prosecuted at the domestic level. Similarly, the ICC can only offer redress to a few victims, leaving the rest to look up to the national system for redress. Based on this, the thesis examines the domestic systems of three ICC- situation countries in order to assess the response at the domestic level in terms of securing domestic accountability and offering redress to victims of international crimes. The thesis assesses {{the extent to which the}} selected countries, being Kenya, Uganda and Côte D’Ivoire carried their share of the burden in investigating and prosecuting perpetrators of international crimes in their domestic jurisdictions upon the ICC’s intervention. The thesis also inquiries into whether the three countries met their obligations towards victims of international crimes...|$|R

Nevertheless, national, professional or individual responsibilities remain heavily debated within and among countries where the Holocaust took place. Even more than 70 years after the events, a self-critical vision of history that accounts for the range of responsibilities in the murder of Jews and other groups such as the Roma has yet to emerge in many places. Nationalistic ideologies continue to influence the ways in which history is remembered and taught.|$|E
50|$|In Sweden, public {{prosecutors}} are lawyers who {{work out of}} the Swedish Office of Public Prosecutions (Åklagarmyndigheten) and direct police investigations of serious crimes. For all criminal cases, {{public prosecutors}} decide arrests and charges {{on behalf of the}} public and are the only public officers who can make such decisions. Plaintiffs also have the option of hiring their own special prosecutor (enskilt åtal). The exception is cases concerning crimes against the freedom of the press for which the Attorney General acts as the prosecuting attorney. In court, the prosecutor is not necessarily in an adversarial relationship to the defendant, but is under an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>investigate</b> and present information which may incriminate or exhonerate the defendant. He is not a judicial officer, nor does he participate in the private deliberations of the court.|$|E

40|$|Industrial {{chemical}} accidents {{can have}} a major impact on society not only because of the immediate harm they can cause to man and property (Toulouse, Enschede), but also because of their potential adverse long-term effects on the environment (Baia Mare). This has clearly been recognised through the development of legislation such as the "Seveso II Directive" and its amendment, and by work carried out by international organizations such as the European Commission (EC) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Approaches to tackling this problem have been put forward such as appropriate land-use planning, risk assessment (safety reports), emergency planning etc. However, it is also acknowledged that learning from history is very important in order to avoid making the same mistakes, and many accidents that materialise now have occurred previously possibly with less severe consequences, possibly in another country or another industry. It has been clearly stipulated within the Seveso Directives that the operators, competent authorities, and the European Commission all have <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>investigate,</b> collect and report information concerning ¿major accidents¿ and share and implement lessons learned. A thorough examination of the causes, circumstances, evolution, consequences and responses to these past accidents generates valuable lessons that can contribute towards future accident prevention and/or mitigation. Before an examination can take place however it is necessary to collect and organise accident information into a suitable format for analysis. The Joint Research Centre of the European Commission supports this goal by ensuring that the information available throughout Europe (and from the OECD) on the occurrence of technological accidents is systematically collected. More specifically, it maintains the Major Accident Reporting System (MARS), which manages information on ¿major accidents¿ in the chemical industry in accordance with the provisions of the European Seveso directives. This chapter outlines a methodology for learning lessons and introduces the European Community¿s MARS database to demonstrate the methodology in practice. One of the reasons why accidents keep occurring is that the lessons from past events have either not been learned or communicated in a systematic way, or they have not been translated into existing risk-management practices. Therefore it is important that the lessons learned are incorporated into all phases of safety management systems. The importance of Safety Management Systems has long-since been recognized, but the author would like to emphasis in particular the role of chemical process design in learning and preventing accidents.

Domestic violence is not specifically criminalized, and while charges may be brought up by the authorities, the police is usually reportedly reluctant to follow up the cases, resulting in the perpetrators enjoying impunity. A crisis center was opened in 2012 for sufferers of domestic violence, but its secret location was reportedly compromised. Sexual harassment is also not prohibited under law, and while it can be possibly prosecuted under the law, its prosecution is seen as ineffective by women's rights groups.
