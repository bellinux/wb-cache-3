5|$|Between September 1988 and January 1989, sailors aboard Iowa {{reportedly}} conducted little {{training with}} her main guns, {{in part because}} of ongoing, serious maintenance issues with the main gun turrets. According to Ensign Dan Meyer, the officer in charge of the ship's Turret One, morale and <b>operational</b> <b>readiness</b> among the gun-turret crews suffered greatly.|$|E
5|$|On 28 March 1939, {{the head}} of RAF Bomber Command Air Chief Marshal Sir Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt hosted a conference {{on the state of}} Bomber Command. Among the many {{problems}} with <b>operational</b> <b>readiness,</b> he noted that that RAF bombs were much too small and that bombsight technology was obsolete. Given the problems of obtaining a modern bombsight, he pressed {{for the creation of a}} high-speed bomber design that could safely attack at low levels.|$|E
5|$|The first {{aircraft}} design {{to receive the}} Su-35 designation had its origins in the early-1980s, {{at a time when}} the Su-27 was being introduced into service with the Soviet Armed Forces. The definitive production version of the Su-27, which had the factory code of T-10S, started mass ("serial") production with the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association (KnAAPO) in 1983. The following year, this Su-27 version reached initial <b>operational</b> <b>readiness</b> with the Soviet Air Defence Forces. Having begun work on an upgraded Su-27 variant in 1982, the Sukhoi Design Bureau was instructed in December 1983 by the Soviet Council of Ministers to use the Su-27 as the basis for the development of the Su-27M (T-10M). Nikolay Nikitin would lead the design effort throughout much of the project's existence, under the oversight of General Director Mikhail Simonov, who had been the chief designer of the Su-27.|$|E

5|$|On 15 October 1942, Gollob {{was made}} Jagdfliegerführer 3, {{responsible}} for tactical fighter command over northwestern France. Jagdfliegerführer 3 was renamed Jagdfliegerführer 5 (Jafü5—5th Fighter Pilot Leader) on 6 September 1943. In this command position, {{he was promoted}} to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) on 20 April 1943, effective as of 1 April, and to Oberst on 1 May 1944. When he became Jafü5 he frequently submitted reports to his superiors at the 5. Jagd-Division (5th Fighter Division) about the suitability of the Bf109 on the Western Front. He indicated that in its present state the Bf109G-3 to G-6 were no longer adequate for service in the West and that the Fw190 and Bf109 were inferior to enemy aircraft. Learning about the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet-powered aircraft, Gollob became a strong advocate of it and its employment as fighter aircraft. Hitler had become interested in the idea of using the Me262 in a fighter-bomber role, which contributed to the delays in preparing the aircraft for <b>operational</b> <b>readiness</b> as an interceptor.|$|E
5|$|On 4 August 1970, coincidentally Coast Guard Day, {{the pair}} of cutters set out on what {{would prove to be}} their last combat patrol. Each cutter had 25 Kit Carson Scouts {{embarked}} for a patrol of the Co Chien River. While following a narrow canal leading off the main channel, Point Marone was the target of a command detonated mine. The blast killed two of the RVN sailors instantly; all five Coast Guardsmen were injured along with 10 Kit Carson Scouts. After the mine explosion, Point Marone listed to starboard but managed to get underway while Point Cypress laid down suppressing fire and escorted the damaged cutter back to base at Cat Lo. Point Marone suffered three shrapnel holes at the starboard waterline as well as extensive damage to the bridge windows and damage to the watertight door between the mess deck and the forward berthing space. The deck aft of the bridge was covered with three inches of mud. After patching and painting, Point Marone was prepared for a final <b>Operational</b> <b>Readiness</b> Inspection to check the RVN crew readiness for the pending turnover of both Point Marone and Point Cypress.|$|E

25|$|The RoCAF's Mirages have {{suffered}} from low <b>operational</b> <b>readiness</b> and high maintenance costs; the harsh environment and high operational tempo had caused higher-than-expected wear and tear. After the presence of cracks in the blades of the aircraft's engines were detected in 2009, Dassault worked with Taiwanese authorities to successfully rectify the issue and provided compensation for the engine damage. By the following year, normal training hours of 15 per month had resumed and the fleet's <b>operational</b> <b>readiness</b> had been restored, after having reportedly dropped to 6 hours per month due to the engine troubles. In addition to this issue, there were considerations of mothballing the entire Mirage fleet due to its high maintenance costs. Although the aircraft's maintenance supplies cost more {{than those of the}} Republic's AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo and the Lockheed F-16 Fighting Falcon, the fleet was reportedly still being maintained adequately because of its popularity. Yet plans to upgrade the fleet had not been carried out as costs for doing so in France would be very high.|$|E
