50|$|The New York and Harlem Railroad laid tracks through Fordham as {{far back}} as 1841, and a station is known to have existed shortly afterwards. The New York and Harlem was bought by the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad in 1864. A March 17, 1848 {{agreement}} gave the New York and New Haven Railroad trackage rights over the NY&H from Williamsbridge south into New York City. NY&NH was merged with the Hartford and New Haven Railroad to form the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1872, and the trackage rights along the Harlem Division remained intact. This aspect of the line would prove to be of little importance to the station until the next century. Throughout the late-19th Century, the Harlem Division was widened and rebuilt into an <b>open</b> <b>cut</b> <b>line</b> as part of a grade elimination project, and Fordham Station was one of several in the Bronx that were rebuilt with a station house on a bridge over all four tracks, including Melrose, the former Morrisania and Tremont stations. The reconstruction of the Harlem Line in this area lead to the creation of Fordham Plaza.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) {{effects of the}} edge magnetic field structure on divertor/scrape-off layer transport, based on an inter-machine comparison of experimental data and on the recent progress of 3 D edge transport simulation. The 3 D effects are elucidated {{as a consequence of}} competition between transports parallel (∥) and perpendicular () to the magnetic field, in <b>open</b> field <b>lines</b> <b>cut</b> by divertor plates, or in magnetic islands. The competition has strong impacts on divertor functions, such as determination of the divertor density regime, impurity screening and detachment control. The effects of magnetic perturbation on the edge electric field and turbulent transport are also discussed. Parameterization to measure the 3 D effects on the edge transport is attempted for the individual divertor functions. Based on the suggested key parameters, an operation domain of the 3 D divertor configuration is discussed for future devices...|$|R

50|$|Dr. Emile Flordon {{testifies to}} {{treating}} a severely beaten patient {{who was wearing}} a jacket from Loddon's brigade. The patient has recovered physically, but his injuries have left him mentally incapacitated. This man could be Wenley, or he could be Loddon. Foxley calls Enid Loddon to the stand, and she testifies that she no longer believes her husband is the real Mark Loddon. Just as it seems Loddon will lose his case, he has a sudden memory and asks {{to take the stand}} again. Loddon explains that the injured man was a German soldier that he encountered while escaping. He beat the man and switched clothing to aid the escape. He <b>cuts</b> <b>open</b> the <b>lining</b> of the jacket that Flordon had brought from his patient. Loddon pulls out a photograph of Enid from before the war, saying it was a gift from her before he left. The defence accepts this demonstration as proof of Loddon's identity. He wins his case and reunites with his wife.|$|R

50|$|To {{obtain the}} maximum number of pieces, the nth <b>cut</b> <b>line</b> should cross all the other {{previous}} <b>cut</b> <b>lines</b> inside the circle, but not cross any intersection of previous <b>cut</b> <b>lines.</b> Thus, the nth <b>line</b> itself is <b>cut</b> in n &minus; 1 places, and into n line segments. Each segment divides one piece of the (n &minus; 1)-cut pancake into 2 parts, adding exactly n to the number of pieces. The new line can't have any more segments since it can only cross each previous <b>line</b> once. A <b>cut</b> <b>line</b> can always cross over all previous <b>cut</b> <b>lines,</b> as rotating the knife at a small angle around a point that is not an existing intersection will, if the angle is small enough, intersect all the previous lines including the last one added.|$|R

The Black Rock <b>open</b> <b>cut</b> was closed prematurely in 1965 due to instability in its western wall. Mining was stopped 40 feet short of its planned final depth of 520 feet, causing a significant quantity of high-grade ore not to be recovered.|$|R
