5|$|Northern England has {{a strong}} export-based economy, with trade more {{balanced}} than the UK average, and the North East is the only region of England to regularly export more than it imports. Chemicals, vehicles, machinery and <b>other</b> <b>manufactured</b> <b>goods</b> make {{up the majority of}} Northern exports, just over half of which go to other EU countries. Major manufacturing plants include car plants at Vauxhall Ellesmere Port, Jaguar Land Rover Halewood and Nissan Sunderland, the Leyland Trucks factory, the Hitachi Newton Aycliffe train plant, the Humber, Lindsey and Stanlow oil refineries, the NEPIC cluster of chemical works based around Teesside, and the nuclear processing facilities at Springfields and Sellafield.|$|E
5|$|Wallachia, {{the first}} {{independent}} medieval state between the Carpathians {{and the lower}} Danube was created when Basarab I (c.13101352) terminated the suzerainty of the king of Hungary with his victory {{in the battle of}} Posada in 1330. The independence of Moldavia, to the east of the Carpathians, was achieved by Bogdan I (13591365), a nobleman from Maramureş, who led a revolt against the former ruler who was appointed by the Hungarian monarch. The independence of the two principalities, however, was rarely secure, and vassalage to multiple states became an important aspect of their diplomacy. Although Wallachia paid tribute to the Ottoman Empire from 1417, and Moldavia from 1456, their two medieval monarchs, Mircea the Old of Wallachia (13861418) and Stephen the Great of Moldavia (14571504) conducted successful military operations against the Ottoman Turks. The two principalities' trade with other parts of Europe began to decrease after the last decades of the 15thcentury. Before this the sale of hides, grain, honey, and wax to the Holy Roman Empire, Venice and Poland, and the import of silk, weapons and <b>other</b> <b>manufactured</b> <b>goods</b> from these areas had been widespread, {{but by the end of}} the 16thcentury the Ottoman Empire became the main market for Romanian products.|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} a case study aimed at {{shedding}} {{some light on the}} magnitude and determinants of Brazil's exporting costs. Two exporting firms were selected to provide information on these costs: one exports primary goods (soybeans), while the <b>other</b> exports <b>manufactured</b> <b>goods</b> (agricultural equipment). It is shown that non-policy trade costs tend to be much higher than policy trade costs, {{especially in the case of}} Brazil's exports of soybeans. International freight costs are also significant in the case of agricultural equipment. Therefore, much larger cost reductions might be achieved through cuts in non-policy trade costs than in policy trade costs.

25|$|Charleston and Savannah {{were the}} main trading ports for the export of deerskins. Deerskins became the most popular export, and monetarily {{supported}} the colonies with the revenue produced by taxes on deerskins. Charleston’s trade was regulated by the Indian Trade Commission, composed of traders who monopolized the market and profited off the sale of deerskins. From {{the beginning of the}} 18th century to mid-century, the deerskin exports of Charleston more than doubled in exports. Charleston received tobacco and sugar from the West Indies and rum from the North in exchange for deerskins. In return for deerskins, Great Britain sent woolens, guns, ammunition, iron tools, clothing, and <b>other</b> <b>manufactured</b> <b>goods</b> that were traded to the Native Americans.|$|E

50|$|Case milling was an {{important}} industry associated with fruit growing. It was valued because it provided a useful outlet for timber which would otherwise have no economic value. There was a high demand for fruit and vegetable cases in the immediate post-War period with case milling peaking in 1949. 45% of cases were manufactured for packaging fresh fruit {{but they were also}} used for a range of <b>other</b> foodstuffs and <b>manufactured</b> <b>goods.</b> By the early 1950s, corrugated fibre board containers, developed during World War II, began to compete with the traditional wooden cases and the latter experienced a steady decline in use. By 1955 - 56 there were still some 58 wooden case manufacturers in Queensland comprising mostly small firms. Some 40% of the case millers in Queensland also milled timber for other uses.|$|R
25|$|The {{report also}} {{highlights}} India's inefficient energy consumption and mentions the dramatic under-representation of these {{economies in the}} global capital markets. The report also emphasizes the enormous populations that exist within the BRIC nations, which makes it relatively easy for their aggregate wealth to eclipse the G6, while per-capita income levels remain far below the norm of today's industrialized countries. This phenomenon, too, will affect world markets as multinational corporations will attempt {{to take advantage of}} the enormous potential markets in the BRICs by producing, for example, far cheaper automobiles and <b>other</b> <b>manufactured</b> <b>goods</b> affordable to the consumers within the BRICs in lieu of the luxury models that currently bring the most income to automobile manufacturers. India and China have already started making their presence felt in the service and manufacturing sector respectively in the global arena.

500|$|After {{three years}} of planning, The College of Engineering {{launched}} the first stages of its Residential Experience for Spartan Engineering, formally known as the Residential Option for Scientists and Engineers (ROSES), the new program is in Wilson Hall after being housed in Bailey Hall {{for a number of}} years. The Residential program essentially combines with a brand new academic component, Cornerstone Engineering, where freshman engineering students not only get an overview of the engineering field(s) but get a hands-on experience along with it. Global Engineering is a new subject that is of interest for not only the Cornerstone Engineering and Residential Experience programs but the entire College of Engineering at MSU. Engineering in today's society has shown to have a monumental impact on the global economy due to advancements in education, interdependence on economics with infrastructure, computers, transportation, technology and <b>other</b> <b>manufactured</b> <b>goods</b> as well as Michigan State University's study-abroad program being ranked No. 1 in the nation, allowing for students to experience education and learn cultures in hundreds of countries. [...] The newly established Cornerstone Engineering and Residential Experience programs for College of Engineering have started programs abroad for more courses in engineering including Study abroad seminars. In 2014, the Detroit Free Press reported on a MSU study which ranked engineering among the top 20 college degrees with the highest starting salaries.|$|E

40|$|Architecturally, {{software}} types can {{generally be}} described as belonging {{to one of three}} basic categories: i) applications, ii) operating systems, or iii) middleware. Applications are software programs providing functionality focused on a particular task for end users, and as noted above, may reside locally on a machine or be delivered remotely. Examples of common software applications for individual household and office users include text processing programs, electronic spreadsheets, desktop publishing programs or various e-mail and web browsing applications. Operating systems reside locally, and serve as the platform interface between the hardware system and other types of user software programs while also providing services (e. g. file print). Middleware is a broad category of software ranging from task-specific functionality to platform-type functionality that permits applications to operate across operating systems and interoperate despite being written in different computer languages. Most software products have a fairly limited product life cycle; {{it is not uncommon for}} new versions of many software applications and operating systems to be released every few years.

50|$|The {{economical}} upswing of Wesseler {{began with}} the monetary reform. Wesseler gained profit from the huge tractor demand in Germany in the 1950s. The sons of Heinrich Wesseler, Ludger and Paul already worked for the company back then. At first it was planned to turn Wesseler into a Fahr dealer, due to Fahr supply problems, Wesseler also sold tractors of other brands such as Normag and Schlüter. Wesseler also sold their own tractors. Later, Wesseler became an important Claas dealer and focused on producing their own tractors. In 1952, a tractor workshop was built, it was increased in size in 1959. However, Wesseler still <b>manufactured</b> <b>other</b> <b>goods</b> suchs as tableware.

Supporters of the specific rates argued that they were necessary, though, because European exporters were routinely providing their American customers with phony invoices showing lower prices for goods than were actually paid. Specific rates made such subterfuge pointless.|$|E
2500|$|Mary was a {{teenager}} when her family emigrated to Canada. In Canada (and later in the United States), the Harris family were victims of discrimination due to their immigrant status {{as well as their}} Catholic religion. Mary received an education in Toronto at the Toronto Normal School, which was tuition free and even paid a stipend to each student of one dollar per week for every semester completed. At the age of 23, she moved to the United States. She became a teacher in a convent in Monroe, Michigan, on 31 August 1859. She was paid eight dollars per month, but the school was described as a [...] "depressing place". After tiring of her assumed profession, she moved first to Chicago and then to Memphis, where in 1861 she married George E.

40|$|The recent {{resurgence}} {{of research on}} infrastructure has basically used simple production and cost functions. The results obtained have given some indications {{of the relationship between}} public infrastructure and economic and regional growth, though the direction of this relationship still remains somewhat unclear. Even more recently different ways of approaching this relationship have been developed that involve the construction of economic growth models incorporating public capital as a basic parameter. There are several differently formulated examples in the literature but one is of particular relevance here. Holtz-Eakin and Lovely (1996) sought to model a small, open economy, with two sectors, one producing consumption goods and the <b>other</b> finished <b>manufactured</b> <b>goods.</b> In this economy there are two production inputs- labour and capital- and the basic question posed concerns the likely effects of an increase in public capital. This paper is about the role of public capital in the development of different sectors and regions of the Greek economy. First, the findings for the non-manufacturing sector of the economy are considered. More specifically, the role of the impact of public capital on the regional Gross Domestic Product and its sub-categories are analysed using of quasi-production functions. Second, the manufacturing sector is considered in terms of the Holtz-Eakin and Lovely model. This delineates two channels by which infrastructure affects the secondary sector: one by altering the scale of production (and subsequently the level of total manufacturing output) and the other by affecting the equilibrium number of manufacturing establishments or returns to variety. Empirically, the paper approaches these themes on four different spatial levels. ...|$|R

There are two explanations for these findings: (1) the aggregation bias of data that combine both agricultural and <b>manufactured</b> <b>goods</b> and (2) the country under study is often an industrial nation like the US or Japan with {{a high proportion of}} <b>manufactured</b> <b>goods</b> in both exports and imports. ...|$|R
