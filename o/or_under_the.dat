5|$|Eggs {{are laid}} from early to mid-April in Britain and Ireland, from mid-May in {{southern}} Scandinavia, and from June in the north. The nest is always {{close to the}} shore, in a cliff crevice or hole, <b>or</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> cover of vegetation. It is constructed by the female from seaweed and dead grass, and lined with finer fibres or hair.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{can be kept}} {{extensively}} or intensively. Extensive systems involve animals roaming at will, <b>or</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> {{supervision of}} a herdsman, often for their protection from predators. Ranching in the Western United States involves large herds of cattle grazing widely over public and private lands. Similar cattle stations are found in South America, Australia and other places with large areas of land and low rainfall. Similar ranching systems {{have been used for}} sheep, deer, ostrich, emu, llama and alpaca. In the uplands of the United Kingdom, sheep are turned out on the fells in spring and graze the abundant mountain grasses untended, being brought to lower altitudes late in the year, with supplementary feeding being provided in winter. In rural locations, pigs and poultry can obtain much of their nutrition from scavenging, and in African communities, hens may live for months without being fed, and still produce one or two eggs a week.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Han dynasty, every male commoner aged twenty-three was liable for conscription into the military. The minimum age for the military draft was reduced to twenty after Emperor Zhao's (r.87–74 BC) reign. Conscripted soldiers underwent one year of training and one year of service as non-professional soldiers. The year of training was served in one of three branches of the armed forces: infantry, cavalry or navy. The year of active service was served either on the frontier, in a king's court <b>or</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Minister of the Guards in the capital. A small professional (paid) standing army was stationed near the capital.|$|E
5|$|Christians {{believed}} in a bodily {{resurrection of the}} dead at the Second Coming of Christ, and the Catholic Church only relaxed its opposition to cremation in 1963. Although mass ossuaries have also been used, burial {{has always been the}} preferred Christian tradition, at least until recent times. Burial was, for as long as there was room, usually in a graveyard adjacent to the church, with a gravestone or horizontal slab, or for the wealthy or important clergy, inside it. Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself, often in a sarcophagus, while often the body is buried in a crypt <b>or</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> church floor, with a monument on the wall. Persons of importance, especially monarchs, might be buried in a free-standing sarcophagus, perhaps surrounded by an elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture; grandest of all were the shrines of saints, which became the destinations of pilgrimages. The monument to MaximilianI, Holy Roman Emperor in the Hofkirche, Innsbruck took decades to complete, while the tomb of Saint Dominic in Bologna took several centuries to reach its final form.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{declaration}} of self-governance, Kedrovsky and the Living Church were awarded the Church's diocesan cathedral in New York City. To prevent further loss of property, the diocese allowed individual parishes to take ownership of their properties, which made them effectively independent. This, combined with {{the increasing number of}} ethnic parishes aligning themselves with other Orthodox jurisdictions (as well as some non-Orthodox), led to a unique situation in Orthodox America whereby multiple jurisdictions overlapped geographically. The remainder of the American Church became known informally as the Metropolia (<b>or</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> jurisdiction of the Metropolitan). Following Patriarch Tikhon's death, the Russian Orthodox Church, led by Metropolitan Sergius, began cooperating with the Soviet government. In 1933, the Russian Church declared the Metropolia to be schismatic.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, a {{dredging}} project was proposed on Leggetts Creek {{to repair the}} damage caused by acid mine drainage and coal mining. In 1991, the Lackawanna River Corridor Association gathered data on the water chemistry and biological habitats of Leggetts Creek. In 2012, the South Abington Sewer Authority began upgrading its sewage treatment plant to prevent wastewater and nutrient pollution from entering the creek. They also installed new sewer lines, including some that run parallel to <b>or</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> creek. PA Trout Unlimited's AMD Technical Assistance Program conducted a survey of the fish population in the creek on November 15, 2013. The Lackawanna Valley Conservancy once received a $190,000 Growing Greener grant for the Leggetts Creek Greenway.|$|E
5|$|Most Apus swift species nest {{in rocky}} areas, and the {{majority}} will accept human habitations {{as a substitute for}} natural sites. The Pacific swift is a colonial species which nests in sheltered locations such as caves, crevices in vertical rock faces (including sea-cliffs), <b>or</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> eaves of houses. The nest is a half-cup of feathers, dry grass and other light vegetation collected in flight, cemented with saliva and attached to a ledge or vertical surface with the same substance. Two or three eggs is the normal clutch, the number varying with geographical location. In areas where three eggs are usual, a fourth may occasionally be laid; no larger clutches are known. The eggs are white, as with all swifts, and 24–27.5x16–17mm (0.95–1.08x0.63–0.67in) in size. They are incubated by both parents for about 17 days prior to hatching as unfeathered and blind altricial chicks. Both adults brood and feed the chicks, which fledge in an average 40.5days.|$|E
5|$|Several {{proposals}} {{have been made}} to bypass the Antelope Valley Freeway by boring a tunnel under the San Gabriel Mountains and extending the Glendale Freeway through it to the Antelope Valley. In 2003, Caltrans published a map showing potential improvements to the transportation infrastructure of southern California. The proposal showed both the unconstructed portion of Route 14 and new routes over <b>or</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> mountains to Antelope Valley. In 2005, the idea was advanced as a combination toll tunnel and surface highway. Preliminary studies estimated costs around $3 billion and suggested charging a varying toll, adjusted for the time of day, averaging around $8 for one-way passage.|$|E

5|$|Since {{free speech}} may be {{exercised}} during assemblies and gatherings, Article 14(1)(b) of the Constitution, which guarantees freedom of assembly, is relevant. Prior to October 2009, the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act ("PEMA") required a licence to {{be obtained from}} the Public Entertainments Licensing Unit (PELU) of the Singapore Police Force before talks, discussions or similar events open to the public were held. Holding an event without a licence would result in a fine or imprisonment. Members of opposition parties claimed that PELU acted inconsistently in issuing licences, and that they had been denied licences without reason. The Workers' Party was fined $800 after a dinner event in 1986, at which the Party's Secretary-General J.B. Jeyaretnam had given a speech. PELU decreed that since the publicly delivered speech had been unrelated to the festivities, a separate licence from the dinner itself was needed. In addition, the Act exempted public entertainments provided by <b>or</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> auspices of the Government, thus allowing MPs from the ruling PAP to speak without a licence in their capacity as grassroots advisors.|$|E
5|$|The Minister can declare any fence or barrier {{surrounding}} {{a part of}} a security area to be a perimeter fence. The Commissioner of Police is permitted to take steps to prevent people from crossing the fence or passing articles over, through <b>or</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> fence, including defensive measures that involve or may involve danger to life. If the measures are taken in a place other than on, under or within the perimeter fence, the Commissioner must take precautions – including displaying prominent warning signs – to ensure that people do not accidentally enter the area. If anyone is injured or dies {{as a result of a}} defensive measure, no compensation is payable unless the Minister certifies that it is just and equitable for such compensation to be paid. It is an offence to cross or attempt to cross, or pass or attempt to pass any article over, though or under a perimeter fence except at an authorized entry point; and to damage, attempt to damage or tamper with any fence or any gate or movable barrier at an entry point.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific swift {{is found}} {{in a wide range}} of climatic zones and habitats. It breeds in {{sheltered}} locations such as caves, natural rock crevices <b>or</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> roofs of houses. The nest is a half-cup of dry grass and other fine material that is gathered in flight, cemented with saliva and attached to a vertical surface. The two or three white eggs are incubated for about seventeen days to hatching. Subsequently, the chicks have a long but variable period in the nest before they are fully fledged. When the parents cannot find sufficient food in bad weather, the young can survive for days without being fed by metabolising body fat.|$|E

5|$|The short-tailed isopods {{have a short}} pleotelson and terminal, stylus-like uropods {{and have}} a {{sedentary}} lifestyle on <b>or</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> sediment on the seabed. The long-tailed isopods have a long pleotelson and broad lateral uropods {{which can be used}} in swimming. They are much more active and can launch themselves off the seabed and swim for short distances. The more advanced long-tailed isopods are mostly endemic to the southern hemisphere and may have radiated on the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana soon after it broke away from Laurasia 200 million years ago. The short-tailed forms may have been driven from the shallow seas in which they lived by increased predatory pressure from marine fish, their main predators. The development of the long-tailed forms may also have provided competition that helped force the short-tailed forms into refugia. The latter are now restricted to environments such as the deep sea, freshwater, groundwater and dry land. Isopods in the suborder Asellota are by far the most species-rich group of deep sea isopods.|$|E
5|$|The skyway was a {{constraint}} in {{the building}} of the New Jersey Turnpike in 1951. The turnpike had to be built low enough to provide enough clearance underneath the skyway, but high enough to then provide sufficient clearance over the nearby Passaic River. Turnpike engineers could have built over the skyway (at a much higher cost) <b>or</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> skyway's trusses; the latter option was chosen. As part of a 2005 seismic retrofit project, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority lowered the Passaic River Viaduct Bridge on its easterly alignment to increase vertical clearance and allow for full-width shoulders underneath the Pulaski Skyway. Engineers replaced the bearings and lowered the turnpike bridge by , without shutting it to traffic.|$|E
5|$|A large {{quantity}} of funerary urns have been excavated from {{the bases of}} buildings; the deceased were cremated and their ashes collected in the urns. The sides of the urns were perforated with three holes, perhaps to represent the eyes and mouth of the deceased. The urns were decorated with polychrome motifs {{in the form of}} highly stylised serpent decorations painted in black, red and cream; this style of Maya ceramics has been labelled as Chinautla Polychrome after the site where it was first identified. The Postclassic Maya custom of interring the cremated remains of the deceased in urns was restricted to the elite; commoners where buried in simple tombs outside the city centre. In Jilotepeque Viejo urns were usually buried under the front of platform bases <b>or</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> sides of pyramids and altars. This was not a general practice among the highland Maya in the Postclassic and represents a tradition unique to the city. Funerary urns have been found interred under all the principal plazas of the city. Approximately equal proportions of urns were interred under platforms and under the ceremonial architecture represented by pyramids and altars, although it is impossible to say if those individuals buried under religious architecture had differing roles than those buried under secular architecture.|$|E

5|$|The HVO and the HV had 20,000 {{troops in}} the region {{at the outset of}} the VRS offensive, but the troop levels {{declined}} to about 5,000 by October. Initially, these units were organized into the Operational Group Sava and Operational Group Eastern Posavina. From mid-May they were organised as Operational Group Eastern Posavina, commanded by Colonel Vinko Štefanek, and subordinated to the Slavonian Field Command in Đakovo commanded by HV Major General Petar Stipetić. HVO units included the 101st, 102nd, 103rd, 104th, 105th, 106th, 107th, 108th and 109th Brigades. The troops also included elements of a large number of HV units: the bulk of the 108th Infantry Brigade based in Slavonski Brod, and parts of the 139th Brigade and 3rd Guards Brigade. HV units from Slavonia and central Croatia were also occasionally engaged: fragments of the 109th, 111th, 123rd and 127th Brigades based in Vinkovci, Rijeka, Požega and Virovitica, as well as several Osijek-based units. Around 200 members of the Croatian Defence Forces (HOS) were engaged on the front, operating independently <b>or</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> command of the 108th HV Brigade. Croat forces mostly acquiered weapons from the HV logistics base in Slavonski Brod. On 15 May 1992, the United Nations issued resolution 752, demanding the withdrawal of HV units from Bosnia and Herzegovina. As the presence of HV units was constantly objected by foreign observers, on 7 July 1992 the Croatian Defence Minister Gojko Šušak issued an order that only volunteers could be deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|The {{demersal}} zone supports {{many animals}} that feed on benthic organisms or seek protection from predators. The seabed provides {{a range of}} habitats on <b>or</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> surface of the substrate which are used by creatures adapted to these conditions. The tidal zone with its periodic exposure to dehydrating air is home to barnacles, molluscs, and crustaceans. The neritic zone has many organisms that need light to flourish. Here, sponges, echinoderms, polychaete worms, sea anemones, and other invertebrates live among algal-encrusted rocks. Corals often contain photosynthetic symbionts and live in shallow waters where light penetrates. The extensive calcareous skeletons they extrude build up into coral reefs which are an important feature of the seabed. These provide a diverse habitat for reef dwelling organisms. There is less sea life {{on the floor of}} deeper seas but marine life also flourishes around seamounts that rise from the depths, where fish and other animals congregate to spawn and feed. Close to the seabed live demersal fish that largely feed on pelagic organisms or benthic invertebrates. Exploration of the deep sea by submersibles revealed a new world of creatures living on the seabed that scientists had not previously expected. Some like the detritivores rely on organic material falling to the ocean floor. Others cluster round deep-sea hydrothermal vents where mineral-rich flows of water emerge, supporting communities whose primary producers are sulphide-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria and whose consumers include specialized bivalves, sea anemones, barnacles, crabs, worms, and fish. A dead whale sinking {{to the bottom of the}} ocean provides food for an assembly of organisms which similarly rely largely on the actions of sulphur-reducing bacteria. Such places support unique biomes where many new microbes and other lifeforms have been discovered.|$|E
