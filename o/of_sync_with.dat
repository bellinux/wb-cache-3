5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} period of around five months. Within {{a few days}} of the impending birth, ewes begin to behave differently. They may lie down and stand erratically, paw the ground, or otherwise act out <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> normal flock patterns. A ewe's udder will quickly fill out, and her vulva will swell. Vaginal, uterine or anal prolapse may also occur, in which case either stitching or a physical retainer can be used to hold the orifice in if the problem persists.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the works}} created {{during the war}} was Yakov Knyazhnin's tragedy Olga (1772). The Russian playwright chose to {{introduce}} Sviatoslav as his protagonist, although his active participation in the events following Igor's death is out <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> the traditional chronology. Knyazhnin's rival Nikolai Nikolev (1758–1815) also wrote a play {{on the subject of}} Sviatoslav's life. Ivan Akimov's painting Sviatoslav's Return from the Danube to Kiev (1773) explores the conflict between military honour and family attachment. It is a vivid example of Poussinesque rendering of early medieval subject matter.|$|E

50|$|The {{combination}} <b>of</b> DIN <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> {{a different}} clock {{system can be}} achieved either by converting the format and / or the clock rate (see list below) or by using a central unit (so called master clock), which provides multiple clock formats. The approach with a masterclock is usually chosen, especially if a synchronization with absolute time is required, such as synchronisation with a tape recorder or with video footage.|$|R
25|$|In 2013, on 28 November, the American holiday of Thanksgiving fell during Hanukkah {{for only}} the third time since Thanksgiving was {{declared}} a national holiday by President Abraham Lincoln. The last time was 1899; and due to the Gregorian and Jewish calendars being slightly out <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> each other, it will not happen again in the foreseeable future. This convergence prompted {{the creation of the}} portmanteau neologism Thanksgivukkah.|$|E
25|$|Historically the paschal {{full moon}} date {{for a year}} was found from its {{sequence}} number in the Metonic cycle, called the golden number, which cycle repeats the lunar phase on a certain date every 19 years. This method was abandoned in the Gregorian reform because the tabular dates go out <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> reality after about two centuries, but from the epact method a simplified table can be constructed that has a validity of one to three centuries.|$|E
25|$|Karaites and Samaritans use {{different}} versions of the Jewish calendar, which are often out <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> the modern Jewish calendar by one or two days. In 2009, for example, Nisan 15 on the Jewish calendar used by Rabbinic Judaism corresponds to April 9. On the calendars used by Karaites and Samaritans, Abib or Aviv 15 (as opposed to 'Nisan') corresponds to April 11 in 2009. The Karaite and Samaritan Passovers are each one day long, followed by the six-day Festival of Unleavened Bread – for a total of seven days.|$|E

40|$|Synapsins are {{abundant}} synaptic vesicle proteins with an essential regulatory {{function in the}} nerve terminal. We determined the crystal structure <b>of</b> a fragment (<b>synC)</b> consisting <b>of</b> residues 110 - 420 of bovine synapsin I; <b>synC</b> coincides <b>with</b> the large middle domain (C-domain), the most conserved domain <b>of</b> synapsins. <b>SynC</b> molecules are folded into compact domains and form closely associated dimers. SynC monomers are strikingly similar in structure to a family of ATP-utilizing enzymes, which includes glutathione synthetase and D-alanine:D-alanine ligase. SynC binds ATP in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner. The crystal structure <b>of</b> <b>synC</b> in complex <b>with</b> ATPgammaS and Ca 2 + explains the preference <b>of</b> <b>synC</b> for Ca 2 + over Mg 2 +. Our results suggest that synapsins may also be ATP-utilizing enzymes...|$|R
25|$|The Church's {{interest}} in astronomy began with purely practical concerns, {{when in the}} 16th century Pope Gregory XIII required astronomers to correct {{for the fact that}} the Julian calendar had fallen out <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> the sky. Since the Spring equinox was tied to the celebration of Easter, the Church considered that this steady movement in the date of the equinox was undesirable. The resulting Gregorian calendar is the internationally accepted civil calendar used throughout the world today and is an important contribution of the Catholic Church to Western Civilisation. It was introduced by Pope Gregory XIII, after whom the calendar was named, by a decree signed on 24 February 1582. In 1789, the Vatican Observatory opened. It was moved to Castel Gandolfo in the 1930s and the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope began making observation in Arizona, USA, in 1995.|$|E
25|$|In {{regards to}} the biotic {{communities}} of the Great Plains, the potential repercussions of these changes could be felt {{in a variety of}} ways. Extreme droughts could kill vegetation, potentially causing the collapse of agriculture in some areas increasing the risk of erosion. This loss of growing medium, nutrients and moisture retention could prove to be a devastating blow to any ecosystem that may try to reclaim the land as well as leaving the barren areas susceptible to more stress tolerant invasive species. Additionally, droughts could dry up prairie potholes essential for the breeding of many species, especially migratory waterbirds. Changes in temperature have the potential to cause range shifts for some species, possibly increasing competition between species that never previously shared a range and even decreasing populations of or eliminating species that can’t effectively spread or adapt to new conditions. Temperature changes, especially earlier springs, could also cause changes in phenology which could put organisms out <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> their ecosystem and eventually lead to their decline. Other potential issues include a loss of biodiversity and decreased productivity within the ecoregion.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the major}} {{features}} of Play the World was a turnless game mode, a new concept never used in the previous versions of the Civilization series. The game mode allowed a sort of mixture between turn based and real time gameplay. Although the concept was good on paper, it never actually worked very well and many online players experienced Out <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> issues along <b>with</b> others. Little support from Firaxis and the sundry other issues resulted in the gamemode not returning in Civilization IV.|$|R
500|$|Contrasting {{with his}} June olives with their blue-green color and coolness of tone, the vibrant oranges and yellows in Olive Trees with Yellow Sky and Sun (F710) evoke the fall season. [...] Novelist Warren Keith Wright visited this {{painting}} at the Minneapolis Institute of Art over a 15-year period, {{transfixed by the}} painting, but unsure why. [...] He {{came to realize that}} the fascination was that the painting represented two periods of time. [...] The late-afternoon sun lies due west above the mountains. [...] The shadows, though, slant from the left, or the southwest, where they would fall in autumn. [...] Not only is the painting out <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> time, it is also out <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> the season.

[...] Others were more positive, though, with Variety saying [...] "faith should be shown in showrunner/writer Jason Katims" [...] while The New York Times said [...] "to hold Friday Night Lights to a measure of realism would be to miss what are its essentially expressionistic pleasures." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Stephen Williams {{described}} filming {{at the sea}} as challenging, {{since the}} waves caused cameras, lighting and the scenery where the actors were standing to be [...] "moving out <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> one another". Williams however thought that the scenes became more realistic due to the location. The aquatic scenes took three nights to complete, and Harold Perrineau received swimming lessons in preparation. When Sawyer {{is getting ready to}} swim to the other platform, a shark swims past, and in an underwater shot a DHARMA Initiative insignia can briefly be seen near its back fin. This was an inside joke or [...] "easter egg," [...] {{which turned out to be}} more visible than had been intended.

50|$|The {{animation}} {{was done}} by the French company BUF Compagnie, which hired approximately 100 animators, most of them from French animation schools and without any previous experience. Besson wanted a photorealistic environment, and BUF initially used microlenses to film physical environments, but eventually instead used photogrammetry, where a digitized photograph of a real object is manipulated with a computer. Sets were built to 1:3 scale, which allowed the animators to use natural elements, such as plants and grass. While the film did not use motion capture, real actors were used as reference, and recorded with 13 to 14 video cameras, but without the markers used in motion capture. Besson directed their performances. In terms <b>of</b> lip <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> actors' dialog, the French animators could not cope with the English phonemes. For Madonna and David Bowie, a camera was used to record their lips to help the animators. The animation was done with proprietary software.|$|R
500|$|In 2013, Disney {{released}} a digitally remastered Diamond Edition of The Little Mermaid on Blu-ray/DVD. Some {{fans of the}} film noticed that an error had occurred during the remastering process that resulted in two brief segments from the [...] "Part of Your World" [...] sequence to play in reversed order, appearing in the opposite order {{of the way in}} which they appeared in the original film. Specifically, Flounder is shown sighing while Ariel is singing one line, whose lips are later shown to be out <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> the words she is singing in the following scene for a few seconds. The edit upset some purist fans who demanded that Disney recall the DVDs. While acknowledging that a [...] "minor oversight" [...] did occur during the editing process that resulted in the switching of two scenes during [...] "Part of Your World", Disney originally assured customers that [...] "There is no impact on the quality or overall experience of the film". However, the studio eventually allowed owners of the defective discs to contact them to receive a free replacement with the error corrected.|$|E

She performed the song on German TV show Schlag den Raab on November 16, 2013. On December 14, 2013, Perry performed [...] "Roar" [...] at the NRJ Music Awards, but suffered technical difficulties which resulted in her performance being stopped by the host halfway through who asked {{for it to be}} restarted. This led many to believe that Perry had initially been lip-syncing the performance. NRJ later released an apology to Perry, stating that she had been singing live but that the wrong mix of the song was played over her live vocals, which resulted in her being visually out <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> the backing track.|$|E

[...] Soap Opera Digest gave the storyline a thumbs up and a thumbs down because, though it was an exciting twist, it happened too closely to the other Chancellor family rewrite undoing the mother and daughter relationship between Jill and Katherine.

In 2011, Tommy Garrett of Canyon News said that Goddard is [...] "forever second guessing his character when asked about Cane by the media", also stating that, [...] "To keep an edgy Cane, never to make him boring and lifeless. That’s why Cane is forever keeping secrets from his wife Lily and step mom Jill." [...] Garrett added that he was [...] "interested to see what Maria Bell's plan is" [...] to keep the character edgy, and that Goddard's performance is [...] "always dependable, on fire and exciting". In 2013, another writer from Canyon News, LaDale Anderson, commented {{that it was difficult}} for Lily to resist attraction to Tyler Michaelson (Redaric Williams), saying that [...] "trouble in paradise is brewing".|$|E

500|$|An {{executive}} for Frontline Studios stated that major publishers were wary of releasing exclusive titles for the Wii, {{due to the}} perception that third-party companies were not strongly supported by consumers. In his blog, 1UP.com editor Jeremy Parish stated that Nintendo was the biggest disappointment for him in 2007. Commenting {{on the lack of}} quality third-party support, he stated that [...] "the Wii landscape is bleak. Worse than it was on N64. Worse than on GameCube...the resulting third-party content is overwhelmingly bargain-bin trash." [...] The Globe and Mail and Forbes noted that the Wii had few successful third-party titles compared to its rivals (due, in part, to its weaker hardware). Third-party developers often skipped the Wii instead of making games for all three consoles simultaneously ("blockbusters like the Call of Duty franchise either never arrive on Nintendo hardware or show up in neutered form"). Forbes observed that of the most successful games of 2011 ( [...] , Mass Effect 3, Portal 2, L.A. Noire, Battlefield 3, [...] ), although all were released for PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, only Modern Warfare 3 received a Wii version which was also the least positively received port of the game. The lack of third-party games may be exacerbated in the future, as Nintendo faces the [...] "dilemma of having fallen out <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> its rivals in the console cycle"; Microsoft and Sony would design their consoles to be more powerful than the Wii U. Strong third-party titles are seen as a key sign of a gaming console's health.|$|E
500|$|Azeem Ahmad of MusicOMH {{positively}} reviewed Good Girl Gone Bad Live {{giving it}} four stars and wrote that [...] "it isn't {{going to win}} over any new fans, but buying it won't disappoint the many that already exist". According to him the songs are different from their recorded versions and sound [...] "infectiously upbeat but in a more grown-up way than the album". Ahmad concluded that even the [...] "cringey" [...] American pronunciation of [...] "Manchester" [...] and associated drivel can't take away the vocal strength of [...] "Rehab".

Ahmad concluded that [...] "If anyone was still wondering, Rihanna isn't miming during this show but the DVD's audio might be little bit out <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> the video." [...] A reviewer of Blu-ray.com was more critical stating {{that even though the}} transfer does not has serious technical flaws, the video can not pair to Live from the Royal Albert Hall (2009) by American rock band The Killers. According to the reviewer there are few close-ups that look soft and also a lot of motion-judder that ranges from mild to strong. He stated that the camera positioning during a lot of acts in not [...] "overly convincing" [...] and some close-ups are too dark. However, according to him contrast levels are good. The reviewer concluded that [...] "all in all, consistency is definitely an issue with Good Girl Gone Bad; parts of the show look great in high-definition, but there are also certain parts of it that are far from convincing."
