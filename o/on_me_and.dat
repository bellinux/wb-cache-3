500|$|In {{his major}} league debut with the Houston Astros on September 14, 1991, he went 3-for-4 {{with a double}} and scored three runs against the Cincinnati Reds. He hit [...]203 in 20 games for the {{remainder}} of the Astros' regular season. With Steve Finley already entrenched as Houston's centerfielder, and aged 26 years, Lofton was traded during the off-season to the Cleveland Indians for catcher Eddie Taubensee and right-handed pitcher Willie Blair.

500|$|US First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt {{also worked}} on Waller's behalf. Historian Richard B.

Roosevelt biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin, in contrast, holds that the First Lady intervened after receiving a handwritten note from Waller himself saying [...] "I have heard lots of people speak of what a nice lady {{you are and what}} I can hear is that you believe in helping the poor ... Please write to the Governor and get him to have mercy <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> allow me a chance."

500|$|It {{is a very}} {{important}} film, Life, and Nothing More..., in that what was filmed was inspired by a journey I had made just three days after an earthquake. And I speak not only of the film itself but also of the experience of being in that place, where only three days before 50,000 people had died. For the survivors, {{it was as if they}} were reborn, having experienced death around them. The earthquake had happened at four or five in the morning, so in a sense everybody could have been dead and it was almost accidental that they hadn't died. So I didn't just see myself as a film director here, but also as an observer of people who had been condemned to death. So this was a very big influence <b>on</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> the issue of life and death from then on does recur in my films[...]|$|E
500|$|On June 15, 1953, Houtteman {{was traded}} by the Tigers, along with Owen Friend, Joe Ginsberg and Bill Wight, to the Cleveland Indians for Ray Boone, Al Aber, Steve Gromek and Dick Weik. In July 1953, he {{returned}} to Detroit to pitch against the Tigers. At the time, Houtteman admitted {{he wanted to be}} traded. [...] He said, [...] "The fans are down <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I'd do everybody a lot more good by being traded". He was not content with the Tigers and said there were times when it seemed he [...] "couldn't wait to peel off his uniform after a game". As a result of Indians' pitching coach Mel Harder doing a [...] "complete" [...] overhaul, Houtteman was moved into the starting rotation, to replace Bob Feller. Houtteman finished the season in Cleveland with a 7–7 record, six complete games, one shutout, 109 innings pitched, and a 3.80 ERA.|$|E

Prior to the match, Joe delivered an unscheduled, unscripted speech to the crowd explaining his anger and distaste for Hall's failure to show up for the event. He said that Hall [...] "punked out <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> on every single fan in this building tonight", and concluded: [...] "Scott Hall, chico, kiss my ass, you punked out and you're a punk". He [...] followed this by announcing Hall's replacement in the match: Eric Young. The six men fought for a total of nine minutes and thirty-one seconds, before Joe slammed Tomko into the mat with his Muscle Buster maneuver to gain the pinfall.|$|E

500|$|... "Circus" [...] is an uptempo electropop and dance-pop song, with a stomp box {{beat and}} {{elements}} of pop rock. [...] The song opens {{with the sound}} of a drum and builds until Spears starts singing, [...] "There's only two types of people in the world/The ones that entertain and the ones that observe". Spears delivers confident and [...] "half-rapped" [...] vocals, with the verses having usage of synthesizers. Lyrically, the song talks about being an entertainer and putting on shows. She explains her emotions while performing in lines such as: [...] "I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins / Spotlight <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I'm ready to break". The chorus begins with an electronic sound, while she compares herself, as well as performing to being on the center of a circus ring. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, [...] "Circus" [...] is composed in the key of F# minor with 120 beats per minute, however on the album the song is 115 beats per minute. Spears's vocal range spans from G#2 to D#5. Kelly commented that [...] "Circus" [...] was [...] "a cool way to get people dancing and having fun", but also have a slight message.|$|E
500|$|... "Dinosaur" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Kesha Sebert, in {{collaboration}} with Max Martin, Shellback; the latter two {{are responsible for the}} song's production. The song's lyrics and conception use a metaphor, comparing an older man to a prehistoric, carnivorous dinosaur. All three composers were responsible for providing the song's instruments. The song's recording was commenced at Maratone Studios, in Stockholm, Sweden, by Martin and Shellback. While being interviewed by Rolling Stone, Kesha was asked about her writing technique and how her songs come to fruition, which she explained using [...] "Dinosaur" [...] as an example. The singer explained that the song's conception was auto-biographical and that it stemmed from a previous experience she had when an older man had been hitting on her, which she elaborated on: [...] "I just write about what I live — literally, my entire record is totally autobiographical, because I think there's a great pop song in anything and everything, any situation. There's a song called 'Dinosaur' about this old guy who was hitting <b>on</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> his toupee was kind of falling off, and I was like, 'Oh my God, you're so old, you're prehistoric, you're like a dinosaur. D-I-N-O-S-A-you are a dinosaur.'" ...|$|E

[...] Of this role, Bond wrote, [...] "My {{share in the}} most {{beautiful}} of all the Gilbert and Sullivan operas was delightfully easy and natural. [...] When Gilbert {{gave it to me}} at the first reading he said, 'Here you are, Jessie, you needn't act this, it's you.'" [...] Gilbert was even more nervous than usual on the first night of Yeomen and came backstage to give his best wishes to the cast. [...] Bond wrote, [...] "I am afraid he made himself a perfect nuisance behind the scenes, and did his best, poor fellow, to upset us all. These first nights were very hard <b>on</b> <b>me...</b> <b>and</b> nearly always my understudy was called upon to officiate on the second night of a play, while I lay exhausted in my bed. [...] , the curtain rises on Phœbe alone at her spinning wheel, and Gilbert kept fussing about... until I was almost as demented as he was. [...] At last I turned on him savagely. [...] 'For Heaven's sake, Mr. Gilbert, go away and leave me alone, or I shan't be able to sing a note!' He gave me a final frenzied hug, and vanished." ...|$|E

500|$|The matter {{exposed the}} {{practices}} of the barely underground economy of wealthy households and largely illegal immigrant suppliers. [...] The owner of one Manhattan nanny agency stated, [...] "It's just a reality of life that without the illegal girls, there wouldn't be any nannies, and the mommies would have {{to stay home and}} mind their own kids." [...] The practice had grown as both married women with children and single working mothers entered the workforce in large numbers during the 1980s, with the extended hours and long commutes of many professional positions further exacerbating it. [...] The Irish and Central and South American immigrant population of domestic workers was augmented by those from the Philippines, China, Ireland, or Poland. [...] People hiring nannies often preferred illegal aliens, who were thought to be easier to find, considerably less expensive, and more loyal if they worked out and easier to fire if they did not. [...] As one Floral Park, Queens, woman said, [...] "I want someone who cannot leave the country, who doesn't know anyone in New York, who basically does not have a life. I want someone who is completely dependent <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> loyal to my family." [...] Americans themselves were largely unwilling to do the jobs.|$|E
500|$|In a 1991 Canadian {{television}} interview, Love {{commented on}} the album's coarse musical structure.

Love also said, [...] "It was all about the expression of my experience. I was not coming from a black void; I was trying to create light... I was trying to heal." [...] In an interview with Spin magazine several years after its release, Love said that she was [...] "posing in a lot of ways" [...] with the album: [...] "It was the truth, but it was also me catching up with all my hip peers who'd gone all indie <b>on</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> who made fun of me for liking R.E.M. and The Smiths. I'd done the whole punk thing, sleeping on floors in piss and beer, and waking up with the guy with the fucking mohawk and the skateboards and the speed and the whole goddamned thing. But I hated it. I'd grown out of it by the time I was seventeen." [...] In a 1994 interview with Kurt Loder, Love admitted to having been [...] "consciously self-conscious" [...] when making the record due to her feeling the need to compete with her peers at the time.|$|E
500|$|Kesha {{had been}} working on Animal for seven years prior to its release, and had written over 200 songs for the album. The {{abundance}} of material extended it from its originally planned twelve tracks to fourteen. Kesha felt that the album had an empowering, carefree message for young women. [...] "For girls, I think it's an empowering record, it's funny, it's cheeky," [...] she said. [...] "I think people need to have fun with whatever they're doing—makeup, their clothes, music, live shows—anything you don't need to take too seriously, don't take too seriously." [...] When asked how the album related to her life, Kesha explained that the album was completely autobiographical. [...] "I just write about what I live—literally, [...] I think there's a great pop song in anything and everything, any situation." [...] She cites her songs [...] "Stephen" [...] and [...] "Dinosaur" [...] as examples of this. She explained: [...] "it's about this guy I've been stalking since I was 15.
