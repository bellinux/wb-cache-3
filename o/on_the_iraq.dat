5|$|The Bush {{campaign}} advertised {{across the}} U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> War, and {{accused him of}} failing {{to stimulate the economy}} and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq, and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.|$|E

25|$|The {{incumbent}} president, George W. Bush, of the Republican Party, was ineligible to {{be elected}} to a third term due to term limits in the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution. McCain secured the Republican nomination by March 2008, but the Democratic nomination was marked by a sharp contest between Obama and initial front-runner Senator Hillary Clinton, with Obama not securing the nomination until early June. Early campaigning had focused heavily <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> War and the unpopularity of outgoing Republican President George W. Bush, but all candidates focused on domestic concerns as well, which grew more prominent as the economy experienced {{the onset of the}} Great Recession and a major financial crisis that peaked in September 2008.|$|E

500|$|In December, Vilsack {{embarked}} on a campaign tour beginning {{in his hometown of}} Pittsburgh. While there, he addressed a local Democratic Committee, reminiscing about his childhood and how his adopted mother overcame alcoholism. He also discussed his policy <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> War, advocating devolving control to the Iraqi government: [...] "It's their country, it's their future and they should be willing to fight for it and they certainly should be willing to die for it." [...] He returned to Iowa for a fundraiser later in the week.|$|E
500|$|The book {{states that}} President Bush [...] "rarely leveled {{with the public}} to explain {{what he was doing}} and what should be expected... The {{president}} was rarely the voice of realism <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> war." [...] It also calls him [...] "the nation’s most divisive figure" [...] and described his foreign policy as a failure, saying [...] "He had not rooted out terror wherever it existed... He had not achieved world peace. He had not attained victory in his two wars." [...] At the same time, the book largely supports the 'surge' strategy and lauds the President for adopting it.|$|E
500|$|A Journey drew a mixed {{reception}} from critics. Financial Times editor Lionel Barber {{called it}} [...] "part psychodrama, part treatise on {{the frustrations of}} leadership in a modern democracy ... written in a chummy style with touches of Mills & Boon". He wrote that it made Blair seem [...] "likable, if manipulative; capable of dissembling while wonderfully fluent; in short, a brilliant modern politician (whatever his moans about the media)." [...] Writing in The Independent on Sunday, Geoffrey Beattie said A Journey offered an understanding of Blair's [...] "underlying psychology." [...] John Rentoul, author of the Blair biography Tony Blair Prime Minister, was equally positive, giving particular praise to the chapter <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> War. [...] "The chapter on Iraq is tightly argued in some detail, which may persuade those with open minds to recognise {{that the decision to}} join the US invasion was a reasonable, if not very successful, one, rather than a conspiracy against life, the universe and everything decent," [...] he said. Mary Ann Sieghart, writing for The Independent said, [...] "whatever its faults, and toe-curling passages, [...] has many good lessons on how to succeed in both opposition and government.|$|E

500|$|After the Iraq War began, Clinton made {{trips to}} Iraq and Afghanistan to visit American troops {{stationed}} there. On {{a visit to}} Iraq in February 2005, Clinton noted that the insurgency had failed to disrupt the democratic elections held earlier and that {{parts of the country}} were functioning well. Observing that war deployments were draining regular and reserve forces, she co-introduced legislation to increase the size of the regular U.S. Army by 80,000soldiers to ease the strain. In late 2005, Clinton said that while immediate withdrawal from Iraq would be a mistake, Bush's pledge to stay [...] "until the job is done" [...] was also misguided, as it gave Iraqis [...] "an open-ended invitation not to take care of themselves". Her stance caused frustration among those in the Democratic Party who favored quick withdrawal. Clinton supported retaining and improving health benefits for reservists and lobbied against the closure of several military bases, especially those in New York. She used her position on the Armed Services Committee to forge close relationships with a number of high-ranking military officers. (By 2014 and 2015 Clinton had fully reversed herself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> War Resolution, saying that she [...] "got it wrong" [...] and the vote in support had been a [...] "mistake".) ...|$|E
500|$|Armstrong {{expressed}} dismay at the then-upcoming presidential election. He felt {{confused by}} the country's culture war, noting the particular division among the general public <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> War. Summing up his feelings {{in an interview at}} the time, he said, [...] "This war that's going on in Iraq [...] basically to build a pipeline and put up a fucking Wal-Mart." [...] Armstrong felt a duty to keep his sons away from violent images, including video games and news coverage of the war in Iraq and the 9/11 attacks. Armstrong noted divisions between America's [...] "television culture" [...] (which he said only cared about cable news) versus the world's view of America, which could be considered as careless warmongers. Dirnt felt similarly, especially so after viewing the 2004 documentary Fahrenheit 9/11. [...] "You don't have to analyze every bit of information in order to know that something's not fucking right, and it's time to make a change." [...] Cool hoped the record would influence young people to vote Bush out, or, as he put it, [...] "make the world a little more sane." [...] He had previously felt that it was not his place to [...] "preach" [...] to kids, but felt there was so much [...] "on the line" [...] in the 2004 election that he must.|$|E
500|$|Early in May, Dodd {{continued}} to campaign in California {{for a few}} days but later shifted back to the strategically important states of Iowa and New Hampshire {{for the rest of the}} month. On May 15 the campaign released its first ad, which detailed his plan for ending the war in Iraq. In the ad, Dodd also criticized his fellow Democratic candidates by stating, [...] "We can't simply wait for a new president. We should have the conviction to stand up to this one," [...] In Washington, Dodd was exposed to debate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> War Spending Bill and new videos from al-Qaeda's second in command Ayman al-Zawahiri. Back on the campaign trail he talked about how he would deal with foreign issues particularly in regards to the situation in Iraq, [...] "I'm not going to let my foreign policy be decided by Mr. al-Zawahiri. Obviously, he's playing his game here. He'd probably like to see us stay down there, bogged down, at the costs we're increasing here, the loss of lives, not to mention the isolation of the United States." [...] When Presidential candidate John Edwards released an ad criticizing Congress' failure to end the Iraq War, Dodd took it personal and shot back at Edwards stating, [...] ""With all due respect, we could have used John's vote here in the Senate on these issues here." [...] He concluded the May campaign by attending House parties in three cities in New Hampshire[...]|$|E
