A 3 x 2 factorial design with three levels of job hierarchy (officers, sub-inspectors & constables) and two levels of job tenure [short job tenure (0 - 5 yrs.) & long job tenure (above 10 Yrs.) ] were used in present study. A total of 240 police personnel from Gorakhpur Zone participated as respondents.

Implementation of EQAVET at national level, however, remains a challenge.

We map out the prevailing epistemological orientation of social learning research through the de-construction of the methodological choices reported in current social learning literature. Based on an analysis of 54 empirical investigations of social learning and natural resources published after peer review, we investigated aspects of research design that include data collection methods, evidence types and the researcher's role. We consider these against different research-orientations (positivist, interpretive, critical, and post-normal). We discuss which research-orientation appears most congruent with the <b>overall</b> <b>commitment</b> and premises of social learning studies. In line with initial expectations this study shows that positivist stances are hardly present, however research that follows a postnormal approach is less frequent than initially assumed.
