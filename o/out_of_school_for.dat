Board of Education Supreme Court decision. After their application to adopt a daughter from Kentucky's foster care system was denied because they already had five children, the Bevins adopted four children– between the ages of 2 and 10– from Ethiopia in June 2012. By 2015, Bevin said all of his children were homeschooled. To avoid disruptions in the children's schooling, the Bevin's opted not to move into the Kentucky Governor's Mansion immediately after Bevin's election as governor in November 2015, instead waiting until after the school year ended in August 2016. The eleven-member Bevin family is the largest [...] to inhabit the mansion since it was constructed in 1914. The family also retains their pre-election home in Louisville.|$|E

[...] He recalled, [...] "There was so much excitement {{in the streets and}} the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful.... We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [...] let our hair grow." [...] Many cast members (Shelley Plimpton in particular) were recruited right off the street. [...] Rado said, [...] "It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples. [...] You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never experience it. [...] We thought, 'This is happening in the streets,' and we wanted to bring it to the stage." ...|$|E

2500|$|Linda Mulhall was 30 {{years old}} at the time of the killing. She was unemployed, had left school early and had four children. The {{relationship}} with the father of her children broke up and she got into another relationship with an individual called Wayne Kinsella who subsequently abused them, in one case beating the children with an electrical flex. The abuse was later investigated, and the children were taken into care by the social services, while Wayne Kinsella served a six-year prison sentence for his cruelty to the children. Kinsella himself had an extremely violent history, having been thrown <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>for</b> violent behaviour, according to his elder sister, Donna. In a 2013 RTÉ Radio interview, Donna Kinsella said that her brother Wayne was always an extremely violent person, even during his childhood, and stated that he used to beat members of his own family, including his parents, and had broken her jaw on one occasion. [...] In May 1996, Kinsella received an eight year prison sentence for the murder of a retired auctioneer, Thomas Foreman, who was killed while visiting his wife's grave in Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin on 23 September 1995. In May 2012, Kinsella was jailed for life after being found guilty of the murder of 29 year old Dubliner Adil Essalhi, who was stabbed to death in a field near Tyrrelstown on 6 January 2011. Kinsella claimed he murdered Adil Essalhi, because he believed that Mr. Essalhi had been involved in the killing of his younger brother, Lee Kinsella, who was shot dead in Finglas in May 2006. Wayne's sister Donna said Mr. Essalhi had nothing to do with Lee's death. Wayne Kinsella's nephew Michael Kinsella would later be jailed for 15 years in May 2016 for helping his uncle kill Mr. Essalhi. Linda Mulhall, meanwhile, had a history of alcohol abuse and suffered from an addiction to heroin. She had one previous conviction in 1993 for larceny.|$|E

We intend to show that the concern of didactics is an issue of great concern (and dispute) in Southern Europe, for which we will use Spain as an example. We will particularly analyse from a didactical approach (taking didactics as a normative applied discipline well established in academia) the possibilities that a traditionally school-based discipline has to improve the development of vocational education practice in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>schools,</b> <b>for</b> young and adult people, in terms of pedagogical innovatio...|$|R
