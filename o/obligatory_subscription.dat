50|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, {{a belief that}} some of those who did not {{subscribe}} to the Westminster Confession were in fact Arian provoked a new phase of the conflict. This ended when seventeen ministers opposed to subscription seceded with their congregations to form the Remonstrant Synod. This led to the restoration of <b>obligatory</b> <b>subscription</b> to the Westminster Confession within the Synod of Ulster and facilitated union with the Seceders in 1840 to create the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, whose first moderator was Dr Samuel Hanna. The united church was active in missionary activity both at home and abroad, particularly benefitting from the evangelical Ulster Revival of 1859.|$|E

This paper analyses the development of handset subsidy-related policies in Korea from 1997 to 2001. In particular, it considers the multiple regulatory schemes and feasibility of regulatory policies from the three authorities: the MIC, the KCC and the KFTC, {{all of which were}} involved with the handset subsidy policy in Korea. In April 1999, these authorities eventually abolished the <b>obligatory</b> <b>subscription</b> period that had underpinned the handset subsidy and finally banned it in June 2000. These decisions affected each of the players differently, ranging from a positive impact on the mobile communication carriers to a negative impact on the handset manufacturers. In addition, conflicting approaches by the different authorities created inconsistencies in the handset subsidy policies. This paper shows that multiple regulatory schemes designed to control handset subsidy policy without consensus increases market uncertainty. It reviews the feasibility of the ban on handset subsidies by regulatory enforcement. With consensus and agreed regulatory goals and consistent, stable and predictable policies, the regulatory costs of the handset subsidy related policy can be reduced.
