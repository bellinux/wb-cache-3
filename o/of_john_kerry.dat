25|$|During the 2004 election, several {{high-profile}} conservative writers {{endorsed the}} Presidential campaign <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>Kerry,</b> {{arguing that the}} Bush Administration was pursuing policies which were anything but conservative. Among the most notable of these endorsements came from Andrew Sullivan and Paul Craig Roberts, while a series of editorials in Pat Buchanan's The American Conservative magazine made a conservative case for several candidates, with Scott McConnell formally endorsing Kerry, and Justin Raimondo giving the nod to independent Ralph Nader.|$|E

Vedder was outspoken in support of Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader in 2000, and Pearl Jam played a series of concerts on the Vote for Change tour in October 2004, supporting the candidacy <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>Kerry</b> for U.S. President. In a Rolling Stone feature showcasing the Vote for Change tour's performers, Vedder told the magazine, [...] "I supported Ralph Nader in 2000, but it's a time of crisis.

500|$|Following Anthony Weiner's first sexting scandal, Tsongas was {{the only}} Representative from Massachusetts to call for his resignation, saying that [...] "it would be {{appropriate}} for [...] to step down." [...] In the 2012 Massachusetts Senate election, Tsongas {{was the first major}} Democratic politician to endorse the winner, Elizabeth Warren, whom she called [...] "a fighter for middle class families". Following President Barack Obama's designation <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>Kerry</b> as United States Secretary of State, there was much speculation that she would run for his seat, which her husband had previously held. Though Tsongas briefly considered a run, she responded she would best be able to serve the people of Massachusetts by continuing to serve in the House, and instead endorsed fellow Representative Ed Markey.|$|E
500|$|DeLonge {{underwent}} a complete reassessment of his prime {{concerns in the}} aftermath of the band's break-up—a move [...] "bearing the hallmarks of a nervous breakdown"—and went on a three-week [...] "spiritual journey" [...] in complete isolation away from his family, contemplating his life, career, and future in music. DeLonge was psychologically hurt by the band's dissolution, likening it to a divorce and calling it a [...] "traumatic experience" [...] and a [...] "disaster." [...] He had been known for his role in the Blink-182 as [...] "the low-brow prankster" [...] and wanted to restart his career without worrying whether fans would find him funny. The background of Angels & Airwaves was based on DeLonge's endorsement <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>Kerry</b> in the 2004 presidential election, travelling the political circuit with the Democratic Party candidate; DeLonge was inspired by Kerry's need for widespread reform and likened his presidential campaign to a drug, remarking later that it [...] "really changed [...]" [...] He rediscovered the epiphany developed during his tour with Kerry and applied it to the philosophy of Angels & Airwaves, while he redefined himself as he learned to play piano and self-produce and formed his own home studio.|$|E

500|$|Several polls from September to November 2003 showed Clark {{leading the}} Democratic field of {{candidates}} or as {{a close second}} to Howard Dean with the Gallup poll having him in {{first place in the}} presidential race at 20% as late as October 2003. [...] The John Edwards campaign brought on Hugh Shelton—the general who had said Clark was made to leave the SACEUR post early due to [...] "integrity and character issues"—as an advisor, a move that drew criticism from the Clark campaign. Since Dean consistently polled in the lead in the Iowa caucuses, Clark opted out of participating in the caucuses entirely to focus on later primaries instead. The 2004 Iowa caucuses marked {{a turning point in the}} campaign for the Democratic nomination, however, as front-runners Dean and Dick Gephardt garnered results far lower than expected, and John Kerry and John Edwards' campaigns benefited in Clark's absence. Clark performed reasonably well in later primaries, including a tie for third place with Edwards in the New Hampshire primary and a narrow victory in the Oklahoma primary over Edwards. However, he saw his third-place finishes in Tennessee and Virginia as signs that he had lost the South, a focus of his campaign. He withdrew from the race on February 11, 2004, and announced his endorsement <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>Kerry</b> at a rally in Madison, Wisconsin, on February 13. Clark believed his opting out of the Iowa caucus was one of his campaign's biggest mistakes, saying to one supporter the day before he withdrew from the race that [...] "everything would have been different if we had [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|Obama noted his interracial and {{international}} heritage: {{he was born}} in Honolulu, Hawaii to a Kenyan immigrant father and a white mother from Kansas. He emphasized the power of education, recounting the privilege of attending the exclusive Punahou School and Harvard Law School despite his family's poverty, and criticized the perception that poor black youths who read books are [...] "acting white." [...] He went on to describe his successful career in law and politics while raising a family in Chicago. [...] "In no other country on Earth is my story even possible," [...] Obama proclaimed. Towards the end of his speech, he emphasized the importance of hope in the American saga, and he illustrated how that hope manifested itself in the lives <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>Kerry,</b> John Edwards, and even his own personal life, as [...] "a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him too." [...] According to Obama, the [...] "audacity of hope" [...] is [...] "God's greatest gift" [...] to Americans, allowing him to feel optimistic that the lives of average Americans can be improved with the right governmental policies. Following the speech political commentator Chris Matthews rightly predicted [...] "I just saw the first black president".|$|E
2500|$|Vedder {{is known}} for his social and {{political}} views. Discussing his views on current issues in the United States, Vedder said, [...] "People on death row, the treatment of animals, women's right to choose. So much in America is based on religious fundamentalist Christianity. Grow up! This is the modern world!" [...] In 1992, Spin printed an article by Vedder, entitled [...] "Reclamation", which detailed his views on abortion. Vedder and Pearl Jam have consistently supported abortion rights and performed at Rock for Choice in 1994. Vedder was outspoken in support of Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader in 2000 and played at Green Party super rallies in Chicago and New York City. Pearl Jam played a series of concerts on the 2004 Vote for Change tour, supporting the candidacy <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>Kerry</b> for U.S. President. Vedder told Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "I supported Ralph Nader in 2000, but it's a time of crisis. We have to get a new administration in." [...] In 2005, during Pearl Jam's first South American tour, Vedder stated, to the immediate and effusive support from the crowd in Rio de Janeiro, that [...] "next time we come to Brazil, the world will be a better place to live, as George Bush will no longer be the President of the United States." [...] Vedder supported the candidacy of Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, and Bernie Sanders in 2016.|$|E
2500|$|When Halvorssen was in prison, {{officials}} in Miami distanced the DEA from Halvorssen {{and stated that}} his drug information was considered unreliable. The head of that office {{at the time was}} Tom V. Cash. [...] Cash, ultimately was involved in covering up the fraud of convicted criminal Allen Stanford of Stanford Bank and had to resign in disgrace from his job at Kroll Associates for both protecting Stanford's reputation and for investigating U.S. Senate investigators rooting out corruption[...] [...] One of those investigated by Cash was Jonathan Winer of the office <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>Kerry.</b> [...] Winer had worked closely with Halvorssen in the 1990s. [...] Kroll, coincidentally, is also the firm that was hired by the banks Halvorssen had been investigating for money laundering: Banco Latino. When Halvorssen was in prison, Tom V. Cash had stated that Halvorssen had [...] "unusual ties to and knowledge of drug traffickers"; the DEA said it [...] "refused to deal with him, citing as reasons 'duplicity and manipulation.'" [...] Halvorssen denied working with Florida agencies, and human rights advocates who knew him said that, considering his involvement in the fight against narcotrafficking, the accusations were not unexpected. Meanwhile, Senate investigators like Jonathan Winer and the New York District Attorney continued to stand by Halvorssen. Another critic of Halvorssen was opinion columnist Manuel Malaver, who published a weekly opinion column in Venezuelan media, in his book La DEA contra la Guardia Nacional de Venezuela claims that Halvorssen was part of parallel underworld of rogue police officers that became involved in a conspiracy to destabilize the government of Ramón J. Velásquez in association with a group of powerful adversaries against the possible presidency of Rafael Caldera or Andrés Velásquez. Presidential elections were scheduled in December 1993 after the impeachment of President Perez in May 1993. Halvorssen publicly responded to Malaver in a 3,500 word point-by-point rebuttal. Halvorssen referred to Malaver as acting in bad faith, malicious, and violating journalistic ethics: [...] "Lamentable, shameful, and cowardly." [...] Malaver's accusations, in his book, contain opinions and provide no statements of fact about the accusations he makes against Halvorssen.|$|E
