5|$|<b>Ocean</b> <b>circulation</b> {{patterns}} have {{a strong}} influence on climate and weather and, in turn, the food supply of both humans and other organisms. Scientists have warned of the possibility, {{under the influence of}} climate change, of a sudden alteration in circulation patterns of ocean currents that could drastically alter the climate in some regions of the globe. Ten per cent of the world's population—about 600 million people—live in low-lying areas vulnerable to sea level rise.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{there have}} been {{cyclical}} ice ages in which glacial sheets periodically covered the higher latitudes of the continents. Ice ages may occur because of changes in <b>ocean</b> <b>circulation</b> and continentality induced by plate tectonics. The Milankovitch theory predicts that glacial periods occur during ice ages because of astronomical factors in combination with climate feedback mechanisms. The primary astronomical drivers are a higher than normal orbital eccentricity, a low axial tilt (or obliquity), and the alignment of summer solstice with the aphelion. Each of these effects occur cyclically. For example, the eccentricity changes over time cycles of about 100,000 and 400,000 years, with the value ranging from less than 0.01 up to 0.05. This is equivalent to a change of the semiminor axis of the planet's orbit from 99.95% of the semimajor axis to 99.88%, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of an internal global salty ocean with an aquatic environment supported by global <b>ocean</b> <b>circulation</b> patterns, with an energy source and simple organic compounds in contact with Enceladus's rocky core, may advance the study of astrobiology {{and the study of}} potentially habitable environments for microbial extraterrestrial life. The {{presence of}} a wide range of organic compounds and ammonia indicates their source may be similar to the water/rock reactions known to occur on Earth and that are known to support life. Therefore, several robotic missions have been proposed to further explore Enceladus and assess its habitability; some of the proposed missions are: Journey to Enceladus and Titan (JET), Enceladus Explorer (En-Ex), Enceladus Life Finder (ELF), Life Investigation For Enceladus (LIFE), and Enceladus Life Signatures and Habitability (ELSAH).|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{performance}} of two operational ocean forecasting systems, the global Mercator Ocean (MO) Operational System, developed and maintained by Mercator Ocean in France, and the regional South China Sea Operational Forecasting System (SCSOFS), by the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center (NMEFC) in China, have been examined. Both systems can provide science-based nowcast/forecast products of temperature, salinity, water level, and <b>ocean</b> <b>circulations.</b> Comparison and validation of the <b>ocean</b> <b>circulations,</b> the structures of temperature and salinity, and some mesoscale activities, such as ocean fronts, typhoons, and mesoscale eddies, are conducted based on observed satellite and in situ data obtained in 2012 in the South China Sea. The results showed that MO performs better in simulating the <b>ocean</b> <b>circulations</b> and sea surface temperature (SST), and SCSOFS performs better in simulating the structures of temperature and salinity. For the mesoscale activities, {{the performance}} of SCSOFS is better than MO in simulating SST fronts and SST decrease during Typhoon Tembin compared with the previous studies and satellite data; but model results from both of SCSOFS and MO show some differences from satellite observations. In conclusion, some recommendations have been proposed for both forecast systems to improve their forecasting performance {{in the near future}} based on our comparison and validation...|$|R
5|$|Wind blowing {{over the}} surface of the sea causes {{friction}} at the interface between air and sea. Not only does this cause waves to form but it also makes the surface seawater move {{in the same direction as}} the wind. Although winds are variable, in any one place they predominantly blow from a single direction and thus a surface current can be formed. Westerly winds are most frequent in the mid-latitudes while easterlies dominate the tropics. When water moves in this way, other water flows in to fill the gap and a circular movement of surface currents known as a gyre is formed. There are five main gyres in the world's oceans: two in the Pacific, two in the Atlantic, and one in the Indian Ocean. The North Atlantic gyre that produces the Sargasso Sea accumulates salinity levels as high as 38‰. Other smaller gyres are found in lesser seas and a single gyre flows around Antarctica. These gyres have followed the same routes for millennia, guided by the topography of the land, the wind direction, and the Coriolis effect. The surface currents flow in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The water moving away from the equator is warm, while that flowing towards it has lost most of its heat. These currents tend to moderate the Earth's climate, cooling the equatorial region, and warming regions at higher latitudes. Global climate and weather forecasts are powerfully affected by the world ocean, so global climate modelling makes use of <b>ocean</b> <b>circulation</b> models as well as models of other major components such as the atmosphere, land surfaces, aerosols, and sea ice. Ocean models make use of a branch of physics, geophysical fluid dynamics, that describes the large-scale flow of fluids such as seawater.|$|E

25|$|Some {{models of}} the <b>ocean</b> <b>circulation</b> suggest that broad-scale {{upwelling}} occurs in the tropics, as pressure driven flows converge water toward the low latitudes where it is diffusively warmed from above.

25|$|Another {{factor that}} {{contributes}} to the climate of the subantarctic region, though to a much lesser extent than the thermohaline circulation, is the formation of Antarctic Bottom Water (ABW) by halothermal dynamics.

40|$|The {{wind power}} input to the <b>ocean</b> general <b>circulation</b> is usually {{calculated}} from the time-averaged wind products. Here, this wind power input is reexamined using available observations, focusing {{on the role of}} the synoptically varying wind. Power input to the <b>ocean</b> general <b>circulation</b> is found to increase by over 70 % when 6 -hourly winds are used instead of monthly winds. Much of the increase occurs in the storm-track regions of the Southern Ocean, Gulf Stream, and Kuroshio Extension. This result holds irrespective of whether the ocean surface velocity is accounted for in the wind stress calculation. Depending on the fate of the highfrequency wind power input, the power input to the <b>ocean</b> general <b>circulation</b> relevant to deep-ocean mixing may be less than previously thought.

50|$|That the nitrate to {{phosphate}} {{ratio in}} the interior of all of the major ocean basins is highly similar is possibly due to the residence times of these elements in the ocean relative to the <b>oceans</b> <b>circulation</b> time, roughly 100 000 years for phosphorus and 2000 years for nitrogen.

25|$|Although {{this is now}} thought {{unlikely}} in {{the near}} future, {{it has also been}} suggested {{that there could be a}} shutdown of thermohaline circulation, similar to that which is believed to have driven the Younger Dryas, an abrupt climate change event. There is also potentially a possibility of a more general disruption of <b>ocean</b> <b>circulation,</b> which may lead to an ocean anoxic event, although these are believed to be much more common in the distant past.

25|$|Climate {{change in}} the Arctic region is leading to {{widespread}} ecosystem restructuring. The distribution of species is changing along with the structure of food webs. Changes in <b>ocean</b> <b>circulation</b> appear responsible for the first exchanges of zooplankton between the North Pacific and North Atlantic regions in perhaps 800,000 years. These changes can allow the transmission of diseases from subarctic animals to Arctic ones, and vice versa, posing an additional threat to species already stressed by habitat loss and other impacts. Where these changes lead is not yet clear, but {{are likely to have}} far-reaching impacts on Arctic marine ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|Ocean {{currents}} greatly affect Earth's climate by transferring {{heat from}} the tropics to the polar regions. Transferring warm or cold air and precipitation to coastal regions, winds may carry them inland. Surface heat and freshwater fluxes create global density gradients that drive the thermohaline circulation part of large-scale <b>ocean</b> <b>circulation.</b> It {{plays an important role}} in supplying heat to the polar regions, and thus in sea ice regulation. Changes in the thermohaline circulation are thought to have significant impacts on Earth's energy budget. In so far as the thermohaline circulation governs the rate at which deep waters reach the surface, it may also significantly influence atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.|$|E

The Pacific (characterized by nutrient poor surface waters, and deep nutrient rich waters) and Atlantic <b>Ocean</b> <b>circulations,</b> are favoring the production/ of silica and carbonate, respectively. For instance, Si/N and Si/P ratios increase from the Atlantic to the Pacific and Southern Ocean, favoring opal versus carbonate producers. Consequently, the modern configuration of large-scale oceanic circulation resulted in the localization of major opal burial zones in the Equatorial Pacific, in the eastern boundary current upwelling systems, and by far the most important, the Southern Ocean.|$|R
