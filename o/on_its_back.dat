5|$|A. r. rupicola was {{described}} by van Rossem in 1946. It {{is found in the}} mountains of southwestern Arizona. It is similar in appearance to A. r. scottii but is darker and grayer <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{function}} of the dinosaur's sail or hump is uncertain; scientists have proposed several hypotheses including heat regulation and display. In addition, such a prominent feature <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>back</b> could make it appear even larger than it was, intimidating other animals.|$|E
50|$|Composite {{bearings}} can be customized to {{meet the}} individual requirements of many applications, such as wear- or high-temperature resistance. The weight of the composite bearing can vary depending <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>backing.</b> The PTFE liner can be applied on steel or aluminum backing. Through filler compounds, various properties of the composite bearing, such as resistance to creep, wear and electrical conductivity, can be optimized.|$|R

5|$|A. r. simulans was {{described}} by van Rossem in 1934, and it is found in northwestern Mexico from southeastern Sonora and southwestern Chihuahua to Nayarit and northern Jalisco. It has more rufous coloration <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>back</b> and is paler on its underbelly than A. r. scottii.|$|E

5|$|Spinosaurus {{has long}} been {{depicted}} in popular books about dinosaurs, although only recently has there been enough information about spinosaurids for an accurate depiction. After an influential 1955 skeletal reconstruction by Lapparent and Lavocat based on a 1936 diagram by Stromer, it has been treated as a generalized upright theropod, with a skull {{similar to that of}} other large theropods and a sail <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>back,</b> even having four-fingered hands.|$|E
5|$|Today's lecture {{will include}} a {{repetition}} of a demonstration which failed last time. A large dog, stretched <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>back</b> on an operation board, is carried into the lecture-room by the demonstrator and the laboratory attendant. Its legs are fixed to the board, its head is firmly held in the usual manner, and it is tightly muzzled.|$|E
5|$|A temulent bee is {{more likely}} to stick out its tongue, or proboscis. Inebriated bees spend more time flying. If a bee is {{sufficiently}} intoxicated, it will just lie <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>back</b> and wiggle its legs. Inebriated bees typically have many more flying accidents as well. Some bees that consume ethanol become too inebriated to find their way back to the hive, and will die as a result. Bozic et al. (2006) found that alcohol consumption by honeybees disrupts foraging and social behaviors, and has some similar effects to poisoning with insecticides. Some bees become more aggressive after consuming alcohol.|$|E

5|$|Burial 67 {{was found}} in a cist under the second of five stucco floor levels in Northeast Plaza Structure 2. The {{skeleton}} was lying <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>back</b> with the head towards the north. The remains were poorly preserved but belonged to an adult. Of the skull only some dental remains were found. A ceramic plate had been placed under the head of the deceased and another plate was placed upon the knees. The plate was painted with four seated anthropomorphic figures with inclined head and wearing leather gloves with jaguar claws. The facial features of the figures are unusual. The bottom of the plate bears the image of a dancer. The ceramics date the burial to the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|Burial 68 {{was found}} in the centre of the Group 18 plaza. The corpse was poorly preserved, it was laid out <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>back</b> with the skull towards the north. The remains were covered with small pieces of {{limestone}} mixed with brown soil. A piece of the upper jaw indicated that the remains were those of a child aged between 5 and 10 years old. Four ceramic pieces were deposited as an offering; two plates, an earthenware bowl and a bowl. Burial 68 is dated to the Late Preclassic.|$|E

The three release the dragon guardian and flee <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>back.</b> Harry sees {{a vision of}} Voldemort killing Gringott's personnel, including Griphook, and learns Voldemort {{is aware of the}} theft. Harry also realises there is a Horcrux at Hogwarts somehow connected to Rowena Ravenclaw. The trio apparate into Hogsmeade, where Aberforth Dumbledore reluctantly instructs the portrait of his deceased younger sister, Ariana, to fetch Neville Longbottom, who leads the trio through a secret passageway into Hogwarts.|$|E

5|$|Individual quaggas {{were also}} {{captured}} {{and shipped to}} Europe, where they were displayed in zoos. Lord Morton tried to save the animal from extinction by starting a captive breeding program. He was only able to obtain a single male which, in desperation, he bred with a female horse. This produced a female hybrid with zebra stripes <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>back</b> and legs. Lord Morton's mare was sold and was subsequently bred with a black stallion, resulting in offspring that again had zebra stripes. An account of this was published in 1820 by the Royal Society. This led to new ideas on telegony, referred to as pan-genesis by Charles Darwin.|$|E
5|$|It has {{parallel}} wing bars on {{the half}} of the wings connected near the white patch giving it a distinctive appearance in flight. The black central rectrices and typical white lateral rectrices are also noticeable in flight. The iris is usually a light green-yellow or a yellow, {{but there have been}} instances of an orange color. The bill is black with a brownish black appearance at the base. The juvenile appearance is marked by its streaks <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>back,</b> distinguished spots and streaks on its chest, and a gray or grayish-green iris.|$|E
5|$|Ninox boobook plesseni {{is known}} from Pantar and Alor Islands {{in the eastern}} Lesser Sunda Islands. It was {{described}} by Erwin Stresemann in 1929. The upperparts are grey-brown and heavily spotted and marked with white, giving rise to a cross-barred pattern <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>back.</b> Its underparts have longitudinal white streaks and its tail is prominently barred. It lives in Eucalyptus urophylla woodlands, and has an unusual low-pitched call different to subspecies boobook. Genetic and call analysis show it to be markedly divergent to the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and colleagues to suggest it be reclassified as a separate species.|$|E

5|$|Stela 5 was {{situated}} {{at the base of}} Structure 1 in the East Plaza. It was carved with a rounded frame containing a figure in profile facing to the left. The figure is standing with the legs together and is wearing a feathered headdress and bears a zoomorphic head <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>back,</b> from which hang more feathers. The hands of the figure are extended forward and appear to bear a staff of rulership. The stela bears a hieroglyphic panel with an incomplete dedicatory date that must fall within the range from December 740 to November 805. The text also contains the name of the king who dedicated the stela, Shield Jaguar, and the Emblem Glyph of El Chal.|$|E
5|$|Technological adaptations {{have also}} {{utilised}} living beetles as cyborgs. For example, a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency funded project implanted electrodes into adult male Rhinoceros beetles, {{allowing them to}} be remotely controlled via a radio receiver held <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>back.</b> Electrical signals delivered via the electrodes command the insect to take off, turn left or right, or hover in midflight. The research was intended to suggest proof-of-concept for surveillance purposes. Similar technology {{has been applied to}} the flower beetle Mecynorhina torquata to stimulate different walking gaits and lengths of a live beetle controllable by a human operator.|$|E
5|$|The Siberian accentor has brown upperparts and wings, {{with bright}} {{chestnut}} streaking <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>back</b> and a greyish-brown rump and tail. The head has a dark brown crown and a long, wide pale yellow supercilium ("eyebrow"). All plumages are quite similar. The nest {{is an open}} cup in dense shrub or a tree into which the female lays four to six glossy deep blue-green eggs that hatch in about ten days. Adults and chicks feed mainly on insects, typically picked off the ground, but sometimes taken from vegetation. In winter, the accentors may also consume seeds or feed near human habitation.|$|E
