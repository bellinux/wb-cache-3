40|$|South Africa {{has one of}} {{the highest}} HIV and AIDS {{epidemic}} statistics in the world, especially people under 25 years of age (Department of Social Development, 2002 : 11). Some university students are implicated, thus Support groups in this context are crucial to help them cope with their unique circumstances. Purpose: of this study was to assess the effectiveness of support groups for SLWHA within a university campus in the Eastern Cape Province. Method: Interviews were used to explore the experiences and challenges of SLWHA. Results: The study shows that support groups are pivotal in the wellbeing of SLWHA in meeting diverse needs such as sense fo belonging, emotional, psychological, information and knowledge,socio-economic as well as health and physical needs. Support group members experience relatively similar living experiences, dynamic as their various lives are, they are able to share their emotions and problems arising from their HIV statuses, thereby lessening their burdens. Some negative experiences were observed, like issues of confidentiality, depression and stress. Conclusion: University support groups can be improved through structured programs that includes various stakeholders like health professionals (wellness centre), university management, and others including academics within the university. Also, expanding their borders via the use of social networks, and expanding their activities to include music, sports, vegetable gardening, group visitations, skills training, and <b>other</b> useful <b>projects</b> <b>shall</b> help to improve lives of victims and fight against the infection of other community members...|$|R
