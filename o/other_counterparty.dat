50|$|Settlement risk is {{the risk}} that a {{counterparty}} (or intermediary agent) fails to deliver a security or its value in cash as per agreement when the security was traded after the <b>other</b> <b>counterparty</b> or counterparties have already delivered security or cash value as per the trade agreement.

50|$|One {{leg of the}} swap {{will pay}} an amount based upon the {{realized}} variance of the price changes of the underlying product.

The other leg of the swap will pay a fixed amount, which is the strike, quoted at the deal's inception. Thus the net payoff to the counterparties will be the difference between these two and will be settled in cash at the expiration of the deal, though some cash payments will likely be made along the way by one or the <b>other</b> <b>counterparty</b> to maintain agreed upon margin.|$|E
50|$|An Evergreen {{option is}} an option where the buyer {{has the right to}} {{exercise}} by providing a pre-determined period of notice. This option could be either American or European in nature or alternatively it could be combined with option styles that have non-vanilla exercise rights. For example, an ‘Evergreen-Bermudan’ option provides the buyer of the option with the right to exercise at set specific points in time after providing the <b>other</b> <b>counterparty</b> with a pre-determined period of notice of their intent to exercise the option. Evergreen options provide sellers with a period of time to prepare for settlement once the buyer has exercised their rights under the option. Embedding evergreen optionality within on and off-balance sheet products can enable counterparties (such as banks that must adhere to Basel III) to lengthen their inflow or outflow obligations.|$|E

40|$|Derivatives are {{commonly}} defined as some {{variation of the}} following: financial instruments whose value {{is derived from the}} performance of a secondary source such as an underlying bond, commodity, or index. This definition is both over-inclusive and under-inclusive. Thus, not surprisingly, even many policy makers, regulators, and legal analysts misunderstand them. It is important for interested parties such as policy makers to understand derivatives because the types and uses of derivatives have exploded in the last few decades and because these financial instruments can provide both social benefits and cause social harms. This Article presents a framework for understanding modern derivatives by identifying the characteristicst hat all derivatives share. All derivatives are contracts between two counterparties in which the payoffs to and from each counterparty depend on the outcome of one or more extrinsic, future, uncertain event or metric and in which each counterparty expects (or takes) such outcome to be opposite to that expected (or taken) by the <b>other</b> <b>counterparty.</b> The framework presented in this Article will facilitate the development of more rational and comprehensive derivatives regulations, including (i) those required under the recently enacted Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the 2 ̆ 2 Dodd-Frank Act 2 ̆ 7) and (ii) those addressing the particular risks associated with 2 ̆ 2 purely speculative derivatives 2 ̆ 2 (those in which neither party is hedging a pre-existing risk) ...|$|E

The Code contains numerous provisions affording special treatment to financial derivatives contracts, the most important of which exempts these contracts from the 2 ̆ 2 automatic stay 2 ̆ 2 and permits counterparties to terminate derivatives contracts with a debtor in bankruptcy and seize underlying collateral. No <b>other</b> <b>counterparty</b> or creditor of the debtor has such freedom; to the contrary, the automatic stay prohibits them from undertaking any act that threatens the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s assets. It is commonly believed that the exemption for derivatives contracts helps reduce 2 ̆ 2 systemic risk 2 ̆ 2 in financial markets, that is, the risk that multiple major financial market participants will fail at the same time and, as a result, drastically reduce market liquidity. Indeed, Congress is now contemplating reforms that would extend the exemption to include a broader array of financial contracts, {{all in the name of}} reducing systemic risk. This is a mistake. The Bankruptcy Code can do little to reduce systemic risk and may in fact exacerbate it, as the experience of L TCM suggests. Risk of a systemic meltdown arose there and prompted intervention by the Federal Reserve precisely because derivatives contracts were exempt from the automatic stay. Derivatives contracts may merit special treatment, but fear of systemic risk is a red herring...|$|E

40|$|Financial {{contracts}} {{promise to}} move wealth {{across time and}} space. Due {{to the difficulty of}} neutralizing bad luck and counterparty conflicts of interest, the economic value and enforceability of financial contracts are never certain. Even though no one can ever completely verify the accuracy or timeliness of information that purports to describe either the condition of a financial institution or the creditworthiness of a borrower or <b>other</b> <b>counterparty,</b> some parties are more informationally disadvantaged than others. Recent financial crises in Latin America, Asia, and Russia underscore the extent to which differences in information can intensify the valuation and performance risks that inhere even in straightforward banking transactions. Rational investors recognize the uncertainty of current information and future events and try to manage its effects. Asset-valuation theory assumes that at any time investors translate whatever information they possess into an estimated probability distribution of how future events are apt to affect the flow of net earnings allocable to different financial contracts. One application of this theory is to explain the existence of financial markets and institutions as instrumentalities that lower the cost to individual firms and households of coping with questionable information and uncertain events (see Ohlson, 1987, Chapter 4). Contemporary financial institutions offer both innovative and tried-and-true opportunities for increasing or decreasing a customer’s exposures to informational risk and event uncertainty. In any given country, informationally disadvantaged parties benefit when government supervision of banking institutions can assure that the operations of these institutions are efficient, fair, and safe. The three central tasks of bank supervisors and regulators are: (1) to control risks of fraud and contract non-performance; (2) to operate a safety net designed to control risks of fire-sale losses associated with FSF insolvencies and unjustified bank runs, and (3) to operate the fraud controls and safety net honorably and at minimum cost to taxpayers. Wall and Eisenbeis (1999) focus on conflicts that complicate the pursuit of such public-policy goals. Minimizing regulatory costs entails striking an optimal balance between the opportunity cost of government supervisory and disciplinary activitie...|$|E
30|$|Let {{us first}} make some {{comments}} from the hedger’s perspective regarding the crucial features of the margin account. The financial practice may require to hold the collateral amounts in segregated margin accounts, so that the hedger, when he is a collateral taker, cannot {{make use of the}} collateral amount for trading. Another collateral convention mostly encountered in practice is rehypothecation (around 90 % of cash collateral of OTC contracts are rehypothecated), which refers to the situation where the hedger may use the collateral pledged by his counterparties as collateral for his contracts with <b>other</b> <b>counterparties.</b> Obviously, if the hedger is a collateral provider, then a particular convention regarding segregation or rehypothecation is immaterial for the dynamics of the value process of his portfolio. We refer the reader to Bielecki and Rutkowski (2015) and Crépey et al. (2014) for a detailed analysis of various conventions on collateral agreements. Here we will examine some basic aspects of collateralization (sometimes also called margining) in our context.|$|R

30|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the credit crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis, several of the classical paradigms in finance were no longer able to describe the new reality and needed to be designed afresh. On the one hand, significant spreads have appeared between rates of different tenors, which {{led to the development of}} multiple curve interest rate models. On the <b>other</b> hand, <b>counterparty</b> credit risk has emerged as the native form of default risk, along with liquidity risk, funding constraints and the collateralization of trades. Therefore, in post-crisis markets the quoted price of a derivative product (or, better, the cost of its hedging portfolio) is computed as the “clean” price of the product together with several value adjustments that reflect counterparty credit risk, liquidity risk, funding constraints, etc. In the context of interest rate derivatives, the “clean” price is typically computed as the discounted expected payoff under a martingale measure using a (discrete tenor) LIBOR market model, while the value adjustments are provided via the solution of a BSDE, which requires the existence of a short rate to discount the cash flows.|$|R

30|$|China’s titanic {{growth has}} been in great part {{a result of its}} trade flows and foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) inflows. For this reason, many policymakers argue that a more flexible exchange rate would negatively influence these trade and FDI flows, hindering China’s growth. On the other hand, studies from Clark, Tamirisa, and Wei (2004) believe that exchange rate volatility does not influence trade flows significantly. The renminbi’s real value keeps a close eye on the dollar and maintains a stable exchange rate, whereas, with its <b>other</b> major trading <b>counterparties,</b> China allows greater exchange volatility. This behavior does not seem to prove an obstacle for China’s expanding trade strategies in other countries. Furthermore, the benefits of enjoying macroeconomic stability that could emanate from increasing exchange rate flexibility could compensate and offset the effects of reduced trade flows. With a greater flexibility, the Chinese financial market would also grow deeper and stronger, together with the foreign exchange market.|$|R

First, it was to coordinate a survey of OTC derivatives dealers designed to develop a clear and comprehensive understanding of existing policies and procedures for documenting, processing and settling OTC transactions and for managing the associated counterparty risks. Secondly, it was to identify any weaknesses in practices that appear to exacerbate counterparty risks significantly or even possibly pose risks to the financial system generally, and to consider changes in practices, including new services, that could mitigate those risks. The study group coordinated interviews with 30 leading dealers in OTC derivatives, including two or more from each of the G- 10 countries. Overall, the results of the interviews indicate that practices for processing trades and managing counterparty risks are broadly similar in all the G- 10 countries. Standard legal agreements and confirmation templates are used to document most transactions. Transaction processing, from data capture through to confirmation and settlement, is increasingly automated, although the more structured transactions still usually require manual intervention. Netting and, to a growing extent, collateral agreements are used to mitigate counterparty credit risks. Finally, the vast majority of OTC transactions are settled bilaterally between the counterparties, rather than through clearing houses. A potential weakness in practices that was identified in the interviews was the existence of significant backlogs of unsigned master agreements and outstanding confirmations. The degree to which risks are exacerbated by these practices cannot be reliably assessed {{on the basis of the}} interview results. Given the size of some of the reported backlogs, this clearly deserves further attention. The study group recommends that both derivatives counterparties and prudential supervisors review the backlogs, assess the risks entailed and take appropriate steps to ensure that the risks are adequately controlled. A development that the study group believes could significantly mitigate risks in OTC derivatives transactions is the rapidly expanding use of collateral. However, to ensure that the benefits concerned are realised, counterparties must effectively manage the liquidity, legal, custody and operational risks of using collateral. The study group recommends that counterparties carefully assess these risks and that prudential supervisors consider developing supervisory guidance in this area. The expansion of clearing houses for OTC derivatives may also reduce counterparty risks. The study group recommends that counterparties assess the benefits of clearing, taking into account the effectiveness of the clearing house's risk management procedures and the effects of clearing on credit risks on uncleared contracts. National authorities should ensure that there are no unnecessary legal or regulatory impediments to clearing and that clearing houses adopt effective risk management safeguards.

The “TED spread” {{is a measure of}} credit risk for inter-bank lending. It is the difference between: 1) the risk-free three-month U.S. treasury bill rate; and 2) the three-month London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which represents the rate at which banks typically lend to each other. A higher spread indicates banks perceive each <b>other</b> as riskier <b>counterparties.</b> The t-bill is considered [...] "risk-free" [...] because the full faith and credit of the U.S. government is behind it; theoretically, the government could just print money so that the principal is fully repaid at maturity. The TED spread reached record levels in late September 2008. The diagram indicates that the Treasury yield movement was a more significant driver than the changes in LIBOR. A three-month t-bill yield so close to zero means that people are willing to forgo interest just to keep their money (principal) safe for three months - a very high level of risk aversion and indicative of tight lending conditions. Driving this change were investors shifting funds from money market funds (generally considered nearly risk free but paying a slightly higher rate of return than t-bills) and other investment types to t-bills. These issues are consistent with the September 2008 aspects of the subprime mortgage crisis which prompted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 signed into law by U.S. President George W.

40|$|Over {{the next}} few years, {{we will see a}} {{pronounced}} increase in the speed at which payment transactions are executed and in the share of cross-border transactions, particularly in the euro area. Counterparty risks and liquidity needs connected with the transfer of funds continue to evolve and to provoke discussion. The fact that funds transfers occur and systems operate on a real-time and gross basis will significantly alter the operational character and technical solutions in this field. Systems following a daily timetable are being replaced by continuously operating systems, which will {{have a significant impact on}} banks' liquidity management. The trend toward immediate real-time payment transactions seems inevitable in the light of present trends. It is generally presumed that RTGS systems operating on a gross basis require more liquidity than netting systems. Liquidity needs depend on payment system structures and payment flows. An even flow of payments requires less liquidity than an uneven flow. Liquidity needs can be significantly reduced by choosing an appropriate payment system structure, taking measures to even out payment flows and agreeing on market practices. The pricing, collateral and reserve requirement policies of the central bank affect also the efficiency of alternative payment systems. Thus the overall efficiency of a gross or net system depends on many factors. Factors arguing for a gross system are differences in counterparty risks, lack of reciprocity, steady interday payment flows and stable liquidity needs, both within and between days. Factors favouring net systems are the existence of small and varying counterparty risks and structurally unsteady payment flows that result in large interday variations in liquidity, even though overnight variations may be moderate. Current, daily-oriented practices have focused on overnight liquidity needs. In a continuously operating environment, liquidity needs are continuously monitored across time-period borders. This means that banks' liquidity management will in the future operate under a new and broader time perspective. Significant liquidity needs and large counterparty risks are inherent parts of Finland's present funds-transfer solutions. Liquidity can be freed for <b>other</b> uses and <b>counterparty</b> risks reduced by changing the structures. The necessary changes have been agreed and soon we will see fundamental changes in Finnish payment systems. payment system settlement; gross settlement; RTGS; payment system counterparty risks; payment system liquidity needs...|$|R

[1] Because tens of trillions of dollars of these financial products were pegged to the economic performance of an overheated and highly inflated housing market, the sudden collapse of that market triggered under-capitalized OTC derivative guarantees of the subprime housing market; and the guarantors’ multi-trillion dollar interconnectedness with thousands of <b>other</b> OTC derivatives’ <b>counterparties</b> within that OTC market (through interest rate, currency, foreign exchange, and energy derivatives) required taxpayers to plug the huge capital holes that cascading nonpayment would have caused, thereby leading the world’s economy to crater.

[3] The article then provides an overview of how recent Congressional OTC derivatives financial reform—Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) —will substantially mitigate those risks if properly implemented by federal regulators, while at the same time allowing financial markets to thrive through ensuring capital adequacy, transparency and liquidity.
