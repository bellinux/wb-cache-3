A search of six electronic bibliographic databases identified 181 non-duplicated titles relating to <b>occupational</b> road <b>safety</b> interventions. These titles were reviewed using pre-determined inclusion/exclusion criteria. This review process generated a total of 20 peer-reviewed relevant articles that collectively assessed the effectiveness of 19 <b>occupational</b> road <b>safety</b> initiatives.

40|$|The {{existence}} of an <b>occupational</b> health and <b>safety</b> policy {{is believed to be}} evidence of management accepting their <b>occupational</b> health and <b>safety</b> role in terms of the <b>Occupational</b> Health and <b>Safety</b> Act. It is accepted that this results in management ensuring the provision of a safe workplace. Despite the emphasis in legislation (the <b>Occupational</b> Health and <b>Safety</b> Act) on the need for management to implement comprehensive <b>occupational</b> health and <b>safety</b> policies, {{there is a lack of}} research on the implementation and efficacy of <b>occupational</b> health and <b>safety</b> policies in the workplace. This study investigates the efficacy with which management carries out their <b>occupational</b> health and <b>safety</b> duties and responsibilities when implementing the provisions of an <b>occupational</b> health and <b>safety</b> policy in the workplace. A number of factors are essential to the efficient performance of management in this regard. These factors include managerial commitment, practices and strategies; communication practices and structures; training initiatives and information; the extent of employee and trade union involvement; and the infrastructure of the organisation. This research study is primarily qualitative in nature. Semi-structured interviews were the primary tool used by the researcher to collect the data. The case-study research method was employed to assist the researcher in collecting the data. The participants involved in the research were selected using the principles of strategic informant sampling and expert choice sampling. The participants consisted of a sample of management, employees and shop stewards. The research findings indicate that firstly, the presence of <b>occupational</b> health and <b>safety</b> policies, practices, strategies and systems in the workplace do not automatically result in reduced hazards, accidents or deaths in the workplace. Secondly, the participation schemes and the communication practices put in place by management are weak. The reason for their weakness is their ineffective implementation by management and use by employees and the trade union. Thirdly, management has a definite impact on the involvement, attitudes and actions of the employees and the trade union in <b>occupational</b> health and <b>safety</b> issues. Fourthly, there is an unequal partnership between management and employees as a result of the educational differences regarding <b>occupational</b> health and <b>safety</b> between them. The outcome is that management and employees are faced with numerous challenges in relation to <b>occupational</b> health and <b>safety.</b> Contributing to this challenge is a lack of sufficient resources allocated to training, resulting ultimately in the ineffective monitoring of <b>occupational</b> health and <b>safety</b> in the workplace. The {{existence of}} <b>occupational</b> health and <b>safety</b> structures and systems does not provide the essential evidence to suggest that their mere presence makes a difference to the workplace safety level. However, through more co-operation and participation by all the parties, these structures and systems have the potential to be effective. KMBT_ 363 Adobe Acrobat 9. 54 Paper Capture Plug-i...|$|R
