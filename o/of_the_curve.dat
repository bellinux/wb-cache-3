5|$|Similar {{results can}} be {{extended}} from closed curves to unbounded curves satisfying a local Lipschitz condition. For such curves, if both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> have infinite area, then the evolved curve remains smooth and singularity-free for all time. However, if one side of an unbounded curve has finite area, and the curve has finite total absolute curvature, then its evolution reaches a singularity in time proportional to the area on the finite-area side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve,</b> with unbounded curvature near the singularity. For curves that are graphs of sufficiently well-behaved functions, asymptotic to a ray in each direction, the solution converges in shape to a unique shape that is asymptotic to the same rays.|$|E
5|$|When {{the stars}} of a {{particular}} globular cluster are plotted on an HR diagram, in many cases {{nearly all of the}} stars fall upon a relatively well defined curve. This differs from the HR diagram of stars near the Sun, which lumps together stars of differing ages and origins. The shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> for a globular cluster is characteristic of a grouping of stars that were formed at approximately the same time and from the same materials, differing only in their initial mass. As the position of each star in the HR diagram varies with age, the shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> for a globular cluster can be used to measure the overall age of the star population.|$|E

5|$|A flow is {{a process}} in which the points of a {{mathematical}} space continuously change their locations or properties over time. More specifically, in a one-dimensional geometric flow such as the curve-shortening flow, the points undergoing the flow belong to a curve, and what changes is the shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve,</b> its embedding into the Euclidean plane determined by the locations of each of its points.|$|E
5|$|An {{approximation}} to {{the curve}}-shortening flow can be computed numerically, by approximating the curve as a polygon {{and using the}} finite difference method to calculate the motion of each polygon vertex. Alternative methods include computing a convolution of polygon vertices and then resampling vertices on the resulting curve, or repeatedly applying a median filter to a digital image whose black and white pixels represent the inside and outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|E
5|$|Curves {{that have}} self-crossings may reach {{singularities}} before contracting to a point. For instance, if a lemniscate (any smooth immersed curve {{with a single}} crossing, resembling a figure 8 or infinity symbol) has unequal areas in its two lobes, then eventually the smaller lobe will collapse to a point. However, if the two lobes have equal areas, then they will remain equal throughout the evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve,</b> and the isoperimetric ratio will diverge as the curve collapses to a singularity.|$|E

5|$|For {{a simple}} closed curve, the area {{enclosed}} by the curve shrinks, at the constant rate of 2 units of area {{per unit of}} time, independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve.</b> Therefore, the total time for a curve to shrink to a point is proportional to its area, regardless of its initial shape.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} Mokhtarian and Mackworth {{involves}} computing the curve-shortening flow, tracking the inflection points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> as they {{progress through the}} flow, and drawing a graph that plots {{the positions of the}} inflection points around the curve against the time parameter. The inflection points will typically be removed from the curve in pairs as the curve becomes convex (according to the Gage–Hamilton–Grayson theorem) and the lifetime of a pair of points corresponds to the salience of a feature of the shape.|$|E
5|$|Transforming a curve {{with equal}} normal speeds at all points {{has been called}} the grassfire transform.

5|$|A PPF (production {{possibility}} frontier) typically {{takes the}} form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> illustrated above. An economy that is operating on the PPF {{is said to be}} efficient, meaning that {{it would be impossible to}} produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. In contrast, if the economy is operating below the curve, it is said to be operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to produce more of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to produce more of both goods.|$|E
5|$|Any {{point that}} lies {{either on the}} {{production}} possibilities curve or {{to the left of}} it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Points that lie {{to the right of the}} production possibilities curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly to the left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|E
5|$|As {{the points}} of any smooth simple closed curve move in this way, the curve remains simple and smooth. It loses area at a {{constant}} rate, and its perimeter decreases {{as quickly as possible}} for any continuous curve evolution. If the curve is non-convex, its total absolute curvature decreases monotonically, until it becomes convex. Once convex, the isoperimetric ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> decreases as the curve converges to a circular shape, before collapsing to a single point of singularity. If two disjoint simple smooth closed curves evolve, they remain disjoint until one of them collapses to a point.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{diffusion}} damping produces {{its effects}} {{independent of the}} cosmological model being studied, thereby masking the effects of other, model-dependent phenomena. This means that without an accurate model of diffusion damping, scientists cannot judge {{the relative merits of}} cosmological models, whose theoretical predictions cannot be compared with observational data, this data being obscured by damping effects. For example, the peaks in the power spectrum due to acoustic oscillations are decreased in amplitude by diffusion damping. This deamplification of the power spectrum hides features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve,</b> features that would otherwise be more visible.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of a PPF, {{opportunity}} cost {{is directly related to the}} shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> (see below). If the shape of the PPF curve is a straight-line, the opportunity cost is constant as production of different goods is changing. But, opportunity cost usually will vary depending on the start and end points. In the diagram on the right, producing 10 more packets of butter, at a low level of butter production, costs the loss of 5 guns (shown as a movement from A to B). At point C, the economy is already close to its maximum potential butter output. To produce 10 more packets of butter, 50 guns must be sacrificed (as with a movement from C to D). The ratio of gains to losses is determined by the marginal rate of transformation.|$|E
5|$|Keynes did not lay out an {{explicit}} theory of price level. Early Keynesian models assumed wage and other price levels were fixed. These assumptions caused little {{concern in the}} 1950s when inflation was stable, but by the mid-1960s inflation increased and became an issue for macroeconomic models. In 1958 A.W. Phillips set {{the basis for a}} price level theory when he made the empirical observation that inflation and unemployment seemed to be inversely related. In 1960 Richard Lipsey provided the first theoretical explanation of this correlation. Generally Keynesian explanations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> held that excess demand drove high inflation and low unemployment while an output gap raised unemployment and depressed prices. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Phillips curve faced attacks on both empirical and theoretical fronts. The presumed trade-off between output and inflation represented by the curve was the weakest part of the Keynesian system.|$|E

30|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>curved</b> microtubules were {{minority}} in our experiments {{their effects on}} <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> self-organization process could be negligible.
