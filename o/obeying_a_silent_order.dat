5000|$|The {{origin of}} the name Vieux Lazaret {{dates back to the}} 18th century, when a hospice (or Lazaret) existed in the village of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. This hospice, {{provided}} by the Lazarists, offered comfort and shelter for the poor and infirm. The Lazarists were <b>a</b> <b>silent</b> <b>order</b> of monks, which were founded in 1625 by St Vincent de Paul to look after the sick and the needy in the French countryside.|$|R

The next moment, they are joined by a nun, who turns out to be Helga in disguise. She asks if they have found out if any of the monks speaks English, but they have not, since it is <b>a</b> <b>silent</b> <b>order.</b> She has also brought them some sandwiches.|$|R

The first floor contains the drawing room which has a decorative ceiling of rococo plasterwork of flower garlands and medallion busts reputed to be of Stannus ladies. The basement contains two underground passageways (now blocked) {{that led to the}} Heritage Centre and the bakers (now chemist). The latter tunnel was reportedly used by <b>a</b> <b>silent</b> <b>order</b> of monks who once lived on the site and apparently supplied the local bakery but wished to avoid contact with townspeople. Today Ghan House is used as a guest house (with wine bar), ballroom, meeting room and cookery school. The current chefs of Ghan House are Stephane Le Sourne and Allan Maynard.|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} concern about aircraft noise {{as a result}} of the rising demand for air transport. According to the US National Science and Technology Council, the environmental impacts of aircraft, including serious noise problems, are likely to limit air transportation growth in the 21 st century. This paper presents a simple decision making model that examines whether it is worth trying to developing <b>a</b> <b>silent</b> aircraft in <b>order</b> to solve the current aircraft noise problems. The model is designed to capture a first approximation of all aspects of the decision, and the findings give a broad picture of the current state of silent aircraft development. The model is simple, but probabilistic and comprehensive enough to make a first estimate of the business case of this long-term project with huge uncertainty. The predicted mean cumulative net present value of the decision to develop <b>a</b> <b>silent</b> aircraft is US$ 13 billion, with 5 th percentile, and 95 th percentile cumulative net present values of US$- 51, and 139 billion, respectively. ...|$|R
50|$|Sheen {{was one of}} nine English medieval priories of the Carthusian <b>order,</b> <b>a</b> {{generally}} <b>silent,</b> enclosed <b>order</b> as {{with other}} orders promoting Christian theology and values {{in an age of}} frequent wars and occasional famine, providing charity for the destitute and natural medicine. The London Charterhouse a few miles ENE was particularly less reclusive order, not merely caring for the sick but founding a school, Charterhouse School, which is today a large fee-paying, selective school of pre-17th century date. Today its site in Richmond, Surrey is in Greater London and the site occupied by housing and businesses. Charterhouse School has moved to a rural part of Surrey. The next and extant Catholic foundation in the county is Chilworth Friary, built in 1892, near to Guildford. The site adjoined existing Richmond Palace to its south.|$|R

5000|$|James [...] "Jem" [...] Carstairs or Ke Jian Ming: A 17-year-old Shadowhunter who {{was forced}} {{to live in the}} London Institute after the {{slaughter}} of his parents in the Shanghai Institute. After being physically tortured by a demon who constantly fed him with the drug yin fen, Jem became sickly and is deathly dependent on yin fen. Though the drug is slowly killing him, he is forced to live on it to stay alive. Being half-Chinese (from mother Ke Wen Yu) and half-English (from father Jonah Carstairs), Jem speaks fluent Mandarin. His allegiance is with the Enclave. Jem's parabatai is Will Herondale. He is known to have silver eyes and silver hair: a side-effect from consuming yin fen; however, when he appears healed from the yin fen, Jem is described as having dark brown hair and eyes of Asian descent. Jem falls in love with Tessa and gets engaged with her; however, the engagement falls through when Jem has to turn into <b>a</b> <b>Silent</b> Brother in <b>order</b> to stay alive. In the epilogue, set in 2008, Jem, now a mortal, reunites with Tessa at the Blackfriars Bridge and rekindles their relationship.|$|R
6000|$|Our {{encounter}} {{took place}} soon after I {{had read the}} volumes Mrs. Highmore had left with me, in which I recognised an intention of a sort that I had then pretty well given up the hope of meeting. I daresay that without knowing it I had been looking out rather hungrily for an altar of sacrifice: however that may be I submitted when I came across Ralph Limbert {{to one of the}} rarest emotions of my literary life, the sense of an activity in which I could critically rest. The rest was deep and salutary, and it has not been disturbed to this hour. It has been a long, large surrender, the luxury of dropped discriminations. He couldn't trouble me, whatever he did, for I practically enjoyed him as much when he was worse as when he was better. It was a case, I suppose, of natural prearrangement, in which, I hasten to add, I keep excellent company. We are a numerous band, partakers of the same repose, who sit together {{in the shade of the}} tree, by the plash of the fountain, with the glare of the desert around us and no great vice that I know of but the habit perhaps of estimating people a little too much by what they think of a certain style. If it had been laid upon these few pages, none the less, to be the history of an enthusiasm, I should not have undertaken them: they are concerned with Ralph Limbert in relations to which I was a stranger or in which I participated only by sympathy. I used to talk about his work, but I seldom talk now: the brotherhood of the faith have become, like the Trappists, <b>a</b> <b>silent</b> <b>order.</b> If to the day of his death, after mortal disenchantments, the impression he first produced always evoked the word [...] "ingenuous," [...] those to whom his face was familiar can easily imagine what it must have been when it still had the light of youth. I had never seen a man of genius look so passive, a man of experience so off his guard. At the period I made his acquaintance this freshness was all un-brushed. His foot had begun to stumble, but he was full of big intentions and of sweet Maud Stannace. Black-haired and pale, deceptively languid, he had the eyes of a clever child and the voice of a bronze bell. He saw more even than I had done in the girl he was engaged to; as time went on I became conscious that we had both, properly enough, seen rather more than there was. Our odd situation, that of the three of us, became perfectly possible from the moment I observed that he had more patience with her than I should have had. I was happy at not having to supply this quantity, and she, on her side, found pleasure in being able to be impertinent to me without incurring the reproach of a bad wife.|$|R

40|$|In budding yeast, telomeres and {{the mating}} type (HM) loci {{are found in}} <b>a</b> heterochromatin-like <b>silent</b> {{structure}} initiated by Rap 1 and extended by the interaction of Silencing Information Regulator (Sir) proteins with histones. Binding data demonstrate that both the H 3 and H 4 N-terminal domains required for silencing in vivo interact directly with Sir 3 and Sir 4 in vitro. The role of H 4 lysine 16 deacetylation is well established in Sir 3 protein recruitment; however, that of the H 3 N-terminal tail has remained unclear. To characterize the role of H 3 in silent chromatin formation and compare it to H 4 we have generated comprehensive high resolution genome-wide binding maps of heterochromatin proteins. We found that H 4 lysine 16 deacetylation {{is required for the}} recruitment and spreading of heterochromatin proteins at all telomeres and HM loci. In contrast, the H 3 N terminus is required for neither recruitment nor spreading of Sir proteins. Instead, deletion of the H 3 tail leads to increased accessibility within heterochromatin of an ectopic bacterial dam methylase and the decreased mobility of an HML heterochromatic fragment in sucrose gradients. These findings indicate an altered chromatin structure. We propose that Sir proteins recruited by the H 4 tail then interact with the H 3 tail to form <b>a</b> higher <b>order</b> <b>silent</b> chromatin structure...|$|R

500|$|After raising $1000 {{showing his}} short films {{to friends and}} family, Kubrick found the {{finances}} to begin making his first feature film, Fear and Desire (1953), originally running with the title The Trap, written by his friend Howard Sackler. Kubrick's uncle, Martin Perveler, a Los Angeles businessman, invested a further $9000 on condition that he be credited as {{executive producer of the}} film. [...] Kubrick assembled several actors and a small crew totaling 14 people (five actors, five crewmen, and four others to help transport the equipment) and flew to the San Gabriel Mountains in California for a five-week, low-budget shoot. [...] Later renamed The Shape of Fear before finally being named Fear and Desire, it is a fictional allegory about a team of soldiers who survive a plane crash and are caught behind enemy lines in a war. During the course of the film, one of the soldiers becomes infatuated with an attractive girl in the woods and binds her to a tree. This scene is noted for its close-ups {{on the face of the}} actress. Kubrick had intended for Fear and Desire to be <b>a</b> <b>silent</b> picture in <b>order</b> to ensure low production costs; the added sounds, effects, and music ultimately brought production costs to around $53,000, exceeding the budget. He was bailed out by producer Richard de Rochemont on the condition that he help in de Rochemont's production of a five-part television series about Abraham Lincoln on location in Hodgenville, Kentucky.|$|R
