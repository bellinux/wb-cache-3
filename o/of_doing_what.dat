A stop-motion model is used in several scenes in the film involving the Terminator's skeletal frame. Cameron wanted to convince the audience that {{the model of the}} structure was capable <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> they saw Schwarzenegger doing. To allow this, a scene was filmed of Schwarzenegger injured and limping away; this limp made it easier for the model to imitate Schwarzenegger.|$|E

Martin Sorrell, a French professor at Exeter, remembers [...] "a quietly competent student, with a denim jacket and dark hair, who, in academic terms, gave the appearance <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> was necessary". Rowling recalls doing little work, preferring to listen to The Smiths and read Dickens and Tolkien.

I think she's being more authentic and doing what she wants to do instead <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> people expect, which is good." [...] Kim, the show's musical director described the idea of the intimate concert, [...] "This project is the most mature project for Beyoncé, because {{to be able to be}} in an intimate setting like this like the Roseland, which is a historic place, it's an amazing thing. I think the challenge of it is to be able to present your whole album as its own concept, as its own piece and it's a great way to educate the people about what this album means to her; It's for her, it's for the fans, it's for anybody." ...|$|E

[...] These were collected and published in 1711 as Reflections on Mr. Wall's History of Infant Baptism. [...] Gale was a superb scholar of Hebrew, Greek and Latin, and he combatted Wall's patristic readings by arguing that the antiquity of infant baptism is not certain. [...] He also accused Wall <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> Wall said he most sought to avoid: elevating a minor doctrinal point into a matter of schism. [...] William Wotton praised Gale's work.|$|E

2500|$|In response, activists {{organized}} the “Friends of West-Park” {{to protest the}} development while concurrently working toward a viable alternative plan as well as funds. The group principally feared the loss of air and light with the new tower. The co-chairman of Friends of West-Park stated that the group was not interested “in telling the church {{that it had to}} maintain itself for the community good without the community taking some role [...] formed a development company capable <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> [...] say and working on a partnership with the church.” The [...] "Friends" [...] suggested selling Eidlitz's chapel for redevelopment to a non-profit, probably a school, to offset the cost of renovation, with neighboring buildings preparing to lease air rights. Most of the external walls would be preserved, restoring the sandstone and stained glass but not the original roof shape nor the forty-foot interior, which would be gutted. Its sanctuary would be raised to gallery level and fitted with movable seating; since divided windows already exist, the alteration would not be externally evident, leaving the commercially ideal ground floor for other uses, possibly social outreach or educational. One architect responsible for the sympathetic second plan explained that “successful rehabilitation allows the character and original intent of the first architect to come through. So the question is, If not every square inch is sacred turf, how much modification can the structure bear without losing what makes it special?” Rev. Brashear of West-Park was quoted as receptive to the community input but stated that the congregation, trustees, and various levels of the Presbytery are still deciding the unprotected church’s fate.|$|E
2500|$|Cruyff's footballing {{principles}} {{have significantly}} influenced the football career of many players and managers, including Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola, two devoted disciples and successors of the Cruyffian (Barça-Ajax) school of football. Without Cruyff operating {{behind the scenes}} as the spiritual father of Barça, {{there could be no}} Joan Laporta presidency, and Rijkaard and Guardiola, two largely unproven managers, could never have been appointed. Guardiola, a typical product (graduate) of Cruyffian school, who was the manager of Barcelona between 2008 and 2012, stated: [...] "Throughout my career I've simply tried to instil what I learned from Johan Cruyff. He has had the biggest influence on football out of anyone in the world, first as a player and then as a coach. He taught me a lot {{and you can see that}} in the fact that so many of his former players are now coaches". Guardiola added, [...] "Johan Cruyff built the cathedral, our job is to maintain and renovate it." [...] In regards to how the football world will remember Cruyff's posthumous legacy, he said, [...] "As a player and as a manager he won a lot of titles, but that's not his legacy. The titles only help. Johan has changed two clubs. Not only did he change Ajax, but also Barcelona – and then the Dutch and Spanish national teams, too. Forget the titles. I've won more titles than him. Messi, for example, is someone runs less and in that he's the best of Cruyff's alumni. (...) I would not have been capable <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> he did at Barcelona. He changed everything. He did it all. What Cruyff's done for football cannot be compared. The statue thing is superficial. He has made us love this sport so openly that there's no way we can forget him." [...] Jürgen Klinsmann, the head coach of the United States national team, said about Cruyff's overall impact on contemporary football, [...] "More than an athlete, Cruyff was also a great thinker, someone who reinvented the sport... Cruyff has left us now, but his vision and philosophy will hopefully live forever. You can see it in the way Barcelona—one of two clubs Cruyff revolutionized, along with Ajax—still plays every week. It's a style that has admirers around the world. I think a lot of people share that [...] with him. You want to see this type of game, where you set the tone, you control the game, you make it fast, you make it attractive and attacking. He's always been famous for his version of the 4–3–3 with the wide wingers, all technically highly gifted and fast. This is his mark." ...|$|E
