25|$|The {{windows that}} faced {{the street in}} the study hall were never opened in order to prevent distractions. A noise was once heard outside the study hall.

25|$|As {{reported}} in David Kushner's Masters of Doom, when Carmack was 14, {{he broke into}} a school to help {{a group of children}} steal Apple II computers. To gain entry to the building, Carmack concocted a sticky substance of thermite mixed with Vaseline that melted through the windows. However, an overweight accomplice struggled to get through the hole, and <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> setting off a silent alarm and alerting police. Carmack was arrested, and sent for psychiatric evaluation (the report mentions 'no empathy for other human beings' and describes Carmack as 'a brain on legs'). Carmack was then sentenced to a year in a juvenile home.|$|E
25|$|In {{the earlier}} {{part of his}} life in Paris, Thiers, like other {{political}} and literary figures of the time, had several mistresses. He was involved in one minor scandal in the summer of 1835, when he was married, Minister of the Interior and member of the Academie Française. He and several ministers of government officials had very rowdy party at the Chateau of Grandvaux, outside Paris. One group of ministers, intoxicated, formed a chorus and serenaded Thiers outside his window. He <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and showed them his rear end. Reports of the event soon appeared in the press in France and across Europe, and did not improve Thiers' reputation with the Paris aristocracy.|$|E

25|$|In 1991, a sixty-five-year-old {{advertising}} executive with no prior history of crime or violence after an argument strangled his wife, <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> {{and threw her}} out of their 12th-floor apartment. His defense team had a structural brain scan done using MRI and PET scan. The images showed a big piece missing from the prefrontal cortex of the brain, i.e., a subarachnoid cyst was growing in his left frontal lobe. The defense team used these images to argue that Weinstein had an impaired ability to regulate his emotions and make rational decisions. The team went with an insanity defense, and the prosecution and defense agreed to a plea of manslaughter. As a result, Weinstein was given a seven-year sentence {{in contrast to the}} twenty-five-year sentence he would have served if he had been convicted of second-degree murder.|$|E
500|$|The balcony {{scene was}} {{introduced}} by Da Porto in 1524. He had Romeo walk frequently by her house, [...] "sometimes climbing to her chamber window" [...] and wrote, [...] "It happened one night, as love ordained, when the moon shone unusually bright, that whilst Romeo was climbing the balcony, the young lady ... <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> and looking out saw him". After this they have a conversation in which they declare eternal love to each other. A few decades later, Bandello greatly expanded this scene, diverging from the familiar one: Julia has her nurse deliver a letter asking Romeo {{to come to her}} window with a rope ladder, and he climbs the balcony {{with the help of his}} servant, Julia and the nurse (the servants discreetly withdraw after this).|$|E
500|$|Breen {{wrote that}} the radiate crown that the Liberty head bears is not {{dissimilar}} to those on certain Roman coins, but is [...] "more explicitly intended to recall that on the Statue of Liberty". Anthony de Francisci recalled that he <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of the studio and let the wind blow on his wife's hair as he worked. However, {{he did not feel}} that the design depicted her exclusively. He noted that [...] "the nose, the fullness of the mouth are much like my wife's, although the whole face has been elongated". De Francisci submitted two reverse designs; one showed a warlike eagle, aggressively breaking a sword; the other an eagle at rest, holding an olive branch. The latter design, which would form the basis for the reverse of the Peace dollar, recalled de Francisci's failed entry for the Verdun City medal. The submitted obverse is almost identical to the coin as struck, excepting certain details of the face, and that the submitted design used Roman rather than Arabic numerals for the date.|$|E

500|$|In the Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions, the raven was {{the first}} animal to be {{released}} from Noah's Ark. [...] "So it came to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of the ark which he had made. Then he sent out a raven, which kept going to and fro until the waters had dried up from the earth. He also sent out from himself a dove, to see if the waters had receded {{from the face of the}} ground." [...] The raven is mentioned a dozen times in the Bible. In the New Testament Jesus tells a parable using the raven to show how people should rely on God for their needs and not riches (...) [...] The raven is also mentioned in Quran at the story of Cain and Abel. Adam's firstborn son Cain kills his brother Abel but he doesn't know what to do with the corpse: [...] "Then Allah sent a raven scratching up the ground, to show him how to hide his brother's naked corpse. He said: Woe unto me! Am I not able to be as this raven and so hide my brother's naked corpse? And he became repentant." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{function}} of active participles {{is to describe}} a secondary action performed by the sentence subject before the main action: Atidariusi langą mergina grožėjosi tekančia saule. – Having <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> the girl admired the sunrise. This function {{is limited to the}} past simple participle and is one of its most common uses. If {{there is a need to}} describe a secondary action performed by the sentence subject at the same time as the main action, the pusdalyvis must be used instead (present active participle does not have this function): Atidarydama langą mergina grožėjosi tekančia saule. – While opening the window, the girl admired the sunrise. See [...] "Adverbial participles" [...] for further explanation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), the rains fell 40 days and 40 nights, the waters swelled 15 cubits above the highest mountains, and all flesh with the merest breath of life died, except for Noah {{and those with}} him on the Ark. When the waters had swelled 150 days, God remembered Noah and the beasts, and God caused a wind to blow and the waters to recede {{steadily}} from the earth, and the Ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. At the end of 40 days, Noah <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and sent out a raven, and it went to and fro. Then he sent out a dove to see if the waters had decreased from the ground, but the dove could not find a resting place, and returned to the Ark. He waited another seven days, and again sent out the dove, and the dove came back toward evening with an olive leaf. He waited another seven days and sent out the dove, and it did not return. When Noah removed the covering of the Ark, he saw that the ground had dried. The third reading ( [...] , aliyah) and a closed portion ( [...] , setumah) end here.|$|E
