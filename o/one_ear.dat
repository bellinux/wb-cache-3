5|$|In 1984, Mantle {{was one of}} four in {{the live}} BBC radio comedy show In <b>One</b> <b>Ear.</b> with Nick Wilton, Helen Lederer and Steve Brown. He {{transferred}} to TV with a version of it in 1987 called Hello Mum which was also live.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{had several}} health problems, {{including}} childhood tuberculous scrofula resulting in deep facial scarring, deafness in <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> and blindness in one eye, gout, testicular cancer, and a stroke {{in his final}} year that left him unable to speak; his autopsy indicated that he had pulmonary fibrosis along with cardiac failure probably due to hypertension, a condition then unknown. Johnson displayed signs consistent with several diagnoses, including depression and Tourette syndrome.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a popular}} folk myth that if one holds a seashell - specifically, most often, a conch shell - to <b>one's</b> <b>ear,</b> <b>one</b> can {{hear the sound of}} the ocean.|$|R
60|$|Now {{the roar}} had got {{so loud that}} it buzzed in <b>one's</b> <b>ears,</b> and every instant it grew louder.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the cossack {{moustache}} was important - the longer the better. Sometimes one had to tuck them away behind <b>one's</b> <b>ears.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog carries {{recessive}} piebald alleles {{that produce}} {{white in the}} coat and skin and are linked to congenital hereditary deafness, though {{it is possible that}} there is a multi-gene cause for deafness in a dog with the piebald pigment genes. Around 2.4% of Cattle Dogs in one study were found to be deaf in both ears and 14.5% were deaf in at least <b>one</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tinnitus is {{the hearing}} of sound when no {{external}} sound is present. While {{often described as}} a ringing, it may also sound like a clicking, hiss or roaring. Rarely, unclear voices or music are heard. The sound may be soft or loud, low pitched or high pitched and appear {{to be coming from}} <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> or both. Most of the time, it comes on gradually. In some people, the sound causes depression, anxiety, or concentration difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Public {{attitudes towards}} feral cats vary widely, ranging from seeing them as free-ranging pets, to {{regarding}} them as vermin. One common approach to reducing the feral cat population is termed 'trap-neuter-return', where the cats are trapped, neutered, immunized against {{diseases such as}} rabies and the feline Panleukopenia and Leukemia viruses, and then released. Before releasing them back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> to mark it as neutered and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again. Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.|$|E

50|$|The sound {{perceived}} may {{range from}} a quiet background noise to {{one that can be}} heard even over loud external sounds. The specific type of tinnitus called pulsatile tinnitus is characterized by hearing the sounds of one's own pulse or muscle contractions, which is typically a result of sounds that have been created from the movement of muscles near to <b>one's</b> <b>ear,</b> changes within the canal of <b>one's</b> <b>ear</b> or issues related to blood flow of the neck or face.|$|R
5|$|Adult males enter a {{state of}} {{increased}} testosterone known as musth. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth {{at the age of}} 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his sheath, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> at a time. This can last from a day to four months.|$|E
5|$|All is well in {{the castle}} until Cunégonde sees Pangloss sexually engaged with Paquette in some bushes. Encouraged by this show of affection, Cunégonde drops her {{handkerchief}} next to Candide, enticing him to kiss her. For this infraction, Candide is evicted from the castle, at which point he is captured by Bulgar (Prussian) recruiters and coerced into military service, where he is flogged, nearly executed, and forced {{to participate in a}} major battle between the Bulgars and the Avars (an allegory representing the Prussians and the French). Candide eventually escapes the army and makes his way to Holland where he is given aid by Jacques, an Anabaptist, who strengthens Candide's optimism. Soon after, Candide finds his master Pangloss, now a beggar with syphilis. Pangloss reveals he was infected with this disease by Paquette and shocks Candide by relating how Castle Thunder-ten-Tronckh was destroyed by Bulgars, and that Cunégonde and her whole family were killed. Pangloss is cured of his illness by Jacques, losing one eye and <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> in the process, and the three set sail to Lisbon.|$|E
5|$|Aoyama {{tries to}} track her down using her résumé, but as Yoshikawa warned, {{all of the}} {{contacts}} are dead ends. At the dance studio where she claimed to have trained, he finds a man with prosthetic feet. The bar where she claimed to work has been abandoned for a year following the murder and dismemberment of the owner. A passerby tells Aoyama that the police found three extra fingers, an extra ear, and an extra tongue when they recovered the body; Aoyama has hallucinations of the body pieces. Meanwhile, Asami goes to Aoyama's house and finds a photo of his late wife. Enraged, she drugs his liquor. Aoyama comes home, pours a drink, and begins feeling {{the effects of the}} drug. A flashback shows that the sack in Asami's apartment contains a man missing both feet, his tongue, <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> and three fingers on one hand. He crawls out and begs for food. Asami vomits into a dog dish and places it on the floor for the man. The man sticks his face into the vomit and hungrily consumes it.|$|E

25|$|Cochlear {{implants}} {{are only}} approved {{for people who}} are deaf in both ears; as of 2014 a cochlear implant had been used experimentally in some people who had acquired deafness in <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> after they had learned how to speak, and none who were deaf in <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> from birth; clinical studies as of 2014 had been too small to draw generalizations from.|$|E
25|$|In {{cases of}} {{auditory}} allochiria, observations recorded {{that when a}} tuning fork was held constantly to <b>one</b> <b>ear,</b> the patient responded {{with a series of}} symptoms, including pain and deafness, in the opposite ear.|$|E
25|$|She had two {{earrings}} in <b>one</b> <b>ear.</b> A piercing in {{her other}} ear had healed. She wore a ring {{that was missing}} its stone. At {{the time of her}} death, she was wearing a multicolored dress and purple tights.|$|E

50|$|Children in some {{cultures}} are often told {{the myth that}} {{you can hear the}} sound of the ocean by holding a seashell to <b>ones</b> <b>ear.</b> This is due to the effect of seashell resonance.|$|R
30|$|A strong {{confusion}} also occurs between rub one’s eyes (I) {{and cover}} <b>one’s</b> <b>ears</b> (H), {{which can also}} be explained by body motions similarities (only upper members are involved, and their motions are close in both cases).|$|R
25|$|Planting density affects {{multiple}} {{aspects of}} maize. Modern farming techniques {{in developed countries}} usually rely on dense planting, which produces <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> per stalk. Stands of silage maize are yet denser, and achieve a lower percentage of ears and more plant matter.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, Miller {{volunteered for}} the United States Army. He was trained as a machine-gunner, and {{severely}} wounded in the Normandy invasion of Europe in World War II (most of <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> was shot away). He spent nearly {{two years in the}} hospital and underwent surgery 20 times.|$|E
25|$|Both {{men were}} beset {{by a variety}} of {{tropical}} diseases on the journey. Speke was rendered blind by a disease for some of the journey and deaf in <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> (due to an infection caused by attempts to remove a beetle). Burton was unable to walk for some of the journey and had to be carried by the bearers.|$|E
5000|$|Pressure Pit - an {{underground}} battlezone, located 500 {{feet below the}} WMAC Arena, featuring crates and construction; this battlezone gets {{its name from the}} fact that the air pressure there can cause <b>one's</b> <b>ears</b> and nose to bleed.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, Ran Blake {{published}} a book with Jason Rogers entitled The Primacy of the Ear. In the 144-page work, Blake explores {{the relationship between the}} ear and the mind in-depth and provides the reader with exercises to train <b>one's</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Other {{than having}} well trained ears, Shouxin was {{also able to}} move each <b>one</b> of his <b>ears,</b> {{independent}} from the other. This earned him another nickname, [...] "Doctor Ears." [...] Shouxin felt that his nickname is interesting and said that [...] "Since friends give me <b>one</b> more <b>ears,</b> I will have <b>one</b> more <b>ears</b> from now on". Later on, he {{changed his name to}} be Nie Er (聂耳).|$|R
25|$|The bullet had severed an {{auditory}} nerve, {{leaving him}} deaf in <b>one</b> <b>ear,</b> {{and he has}} suffered from chronic pain from bullet fragments lodged in his brain. He was visited {{the day after the}} shooting by Mayor John V. Lindsay and Police Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy, and the police department harassed him with hourly bed checks. He later testified before the Knapp Commission.|$|E
25|$|Green {{sea turtles}} {{tend to have}} good vision, well adapted to a life at sea. The turtles can see many colors, but are most {{sensitive}} to light from violet to yellow or wavelengths of 400 to 600 nanometers. They do not see many colors in the orange to red portion of the light spectrum. On land, however, the sea turtles are nearsighted because the lenses in the eyes are spherical and adjusted to refraction underwater. Sea turtles have no external ear and only <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> bone, called the columella. With <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> bone, the turtles can only hear low frequency sounds, from 200 to 700Hz. Sounds can also be detected through vibrations of the head, backbone, and shell. The nose of the turtle has two external openings and connects {{to the roof of}} the mouth through internal openings. The lower surface of the nasal passage has two sets of sensory cells called the Jacobson’s organ. The turtle can use this organ to smell by pumping water in and out of its nose.|$|E

50|$|One {{can hear}} a {{leathery}} sound when cleaning <b>one’s</b> <b>ear</b> canal using a cotton-tipped swab. This {{is an example of}} sound transmitted via cartilage conduction. In cartilage conduction, sound (vibration) energy stimulates the cartilages of the external auditory canal and induces air vibration. This air vibration can be then transmitted into the inner ear via the eardrum and middle ear, which in turn activates the cochlear nerve. Air vibration created from cartilage conduction is combined with sound from air conduction at the ear canal, and thus an amplified sound is perceived. This same phenomenon can be experienced when a telephone receiver is pressed against <b>one’s</b> <b>ear</b> when it is difficult to hear the person {{on the other end of}} the call.|$|R
25|$|Stethoscope (for {{listening}} to heartbeat, respiration and, {{in the case}} of suspected colic, gut sounds) Pulse and respiration can be determined without a stethoscope. Gut sounds can be heard by putting <b>one's</b> <b>ear</b> to the horse's side, but doing so increases the risk of being kicked by the horse.|$|R
