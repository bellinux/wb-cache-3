5000|$|<b>Percussion</b> <b>cap,</b> for {{an early}} history of priming powder and <b>percussion</b> <b>caps</b> ...|$|R
50|$|In the 1850s, the <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> {{was first}} {{integrated}} into a metallic cartridge, which contained the bullet, powder charge and primer. By the late 1860s, breech-loading metallic cartridges had made the <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> system obsolete. Today, reproduction percussion firearms are popular for recreational shooters and <b>percussion</b> <b>caps</b> are still available (though some modern muzzleloaders use shotshell primers instead of <b>caps).</b> Most <b>percussion</b> <b>caps</b> now use non-corrosive compounds such as lead styphnate.|$|R
50|$|Most rifles, {{including}} some that were breech-loading, also used a <b>percussion</b> <b>cap,</b> which {{required that the}} soldier carry <b>percussion</b> <b>caps</b> {{in addition to other}} ammunition requirements. These requirements would have been powder, bullets, patches, and <b>percussion</b> <b>caps.</b> A soldier using a Frank Wesson or Henry rifle would have only needed to carry cartridges.|$|R
2500|$|Later models {{used the}} <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> action, {{although}} both actions were manufactured and sold for some time. For arms {{of his own}} design, he adopted the newer <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> technology, putting his pistol on the modern cutting edge. [...] He was innovating; the <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> was perfected about 1820, and Deringer was marketing them by the 1830s, and possibly the mid-1820s.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> {{is a small}} {{cylinder}} {{of copper}} or brass with one closed end. Inside the closed end is {{a small amount of}} a shock-sensitive explosive material such as fulminate of mercury. The <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> is placed over a hollow metal [...] "nipple" [...] at the rear end of the gun barrel. Pulling the trigger releases a hammer that strikes the <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> and ignites the explosive primer. The flame travels through the hollow nipple to ignite the main powder charge. <b>Percussion</b> <b>caps</b> were, and still are, made in small sizes for pistols and larger sizes for rifles and muskets.|$|R
50|$|The Model 1816 was {{originally}} produced as a flintlock musket. Like many flintlock muskets, {{many of these}} were later converted to <b>percussion</b> <b>cap,</b> as the <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> system was much more reliable and weather resistant.|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{solution}} to the problem of obtaining ammunition for the very old pinfire cartridges is even available. This solution uses specialized cartridges that use a removable pin and anvil which hold a <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> of the type use in caplock firearms. To reload a fired case, the pin is removed, allowing the anvil to slide out; a <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> is placed in the anvil, it is re-inserted, and the pin serves to lock the anvil in place, as well as to ignite the <b>percussion</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|R

50|$|Fulminate-primed {{guns were}} also {{less likely to}} misfire than flintlock guns. However, {{it was not until}} after Forsyth's patents expired that the {{conventional}} <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> system was developed. The <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> helped lead to the self-contained cartridge, where the bullet is held in by the casing, the casing is filled with gunpowder, and a primer is at the end.|$|R
50|$|The {{percussion}} rifle is a rifle {{that uses}} a <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> instead of older flintlock or matchlock variants. Faster reloading and fewer moving parts made this rifle more versatile and rugged compared to other single-shot rifles. The other advantage was that <b>percussion</b> <b>caps</b> were more reliable in bad weather, flintlocks and or matchlocks rifles did not work well in rain.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Percussion</b> <b>caps</b> (caplock mechanisms), {{coming into}} wide {{service in the}} 19th century, were a {{dramatic}} improvement over flintlocks. With the <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> mechanism, the small primer charge of gunpowder used in all preceding firearms {{was replaced by a}} completely self-contained explosive charge contained in a small brass [...] "cap". The cap was fastened to the touch hole of the gun (extended to form a [...] "nipple") and ignited by the impact of the gun's [...] "hammer". (The hammer is roughly the same as the cock found on flintlocks except that it doesn't clamp onto anything.) In the case of <b>percussion</b> <b>caps</b> the hammer was hollow on the end to fit around the cap {{in order to keep the}} cap from fragmenting and injuring the shooter.|$|R

50|$|The Model 1855 {{also used}} the Maynard tape primer, which was an attempt at {{improving}} the <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> system that had been previously developed. Instead of using individual caps {{which had to be}} placed for every shot, the Maynard system used a tape which was automatically fed every time the hammer was cocked, similar to the way a modern child's cap gun works. While the powder and Minié ball still had to be loaded conventionally, the tape system was designed to automate the placing of the <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> and therefore speed up the overall rate of fire of the weapon. The Maynard tape system gave the Model 1855 a unique hump under the musket's hammer. The weapon could also be primed in the usual way with standard <b>percussion</b> <b>caps</b> if the tape was unavailable.|$|R

50|$|Joshua Shaw, an English-born American, is {{sometimes}} {{credited with the}} development of the first metallic <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> in 1814, but his claim remains clouded with controversy as he did not patent the idea until 1822. Furthermore, according to Lewis Winant, the US government's decision to award Shaw $25,000 as compensation for his invention was actually a mistake. Congress believed Shaw's patent was the earliest and awarded him a large sum of money based on this belief. However, a claim for the <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> was filed in 1819 and granted in 1820 as an addition to an 1818 patent by Francois Prelat, two years before Shaw's patent. This doesn't necessarily make Prelat the inventor however, as he made a habit of copying English patents and inventions at the time and the mode of operation he describes is flawed. According to historian Sidney James Gooding, the most likely inventor of the <b>percussion</b> <b>cap</b> is Joseph Egg, around 1817. Shaw's <b>percussion</b> <b>caps</b> used a mixture of fulminate of mercury, chlorate of potash, and ground glass contained in a small metallic cup. Other possible claimants include Joseph Manton and Col. Peter Hawker.|$|R
50|$|Potassium {{chlorate}} was one {{key ingredient}} in early firearms <b>percussion</b> <b>caps</b> (primers). It continues in that application, where not supplanted by potassium perchlorate.|$|R
