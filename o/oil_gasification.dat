40|$|The {{gasification}} of pinewood {{pyrolysis oil}} with potassium hydroxide dissolved was investigated, using a potassium salt loaded char as catalyst, to screen if this {{would result in}} a lower tar yield in the product stream. Experiments were performed at 700 °C, after which the product stream was thoroughly condensed and the gas stream was analyzed. The results show a significant tar reduction for a fixed potassium-loaded char bed at a gas hourly space velocity (GC 1 HSV) of 237 h– 1. If the GC 1 HSV is reduced, the reduction in tar increases. A reduction of a factor of 10 was observed when the feed was also loaded with 5 wt % KOH. Based on the principle that the potassium ion catalyzes the cracking of tars into char or gas, it is proposed that this formed char is easily and fully gasifiable, leading to a feasible, continuous low-tar pyrolysis <b>oil</b> <b>gasification</b> process. The results show promise of deep tar removal under more severe conditions, resulting in a much smaller tar removal step afterward.

40|$|The {{novelty of}} using {{pyrolysis}} {{oil in the}} steam-iron process to produce pure hydrogen is introduced. In this process, products of pyrolysis <b>oil</b> <b>gasification</b> are used to reduce iron oxides which are subsequently oxidized with steam, resulting in pure hydrogen. Two process alternatives are considered: (i) a once-through concept in which cheap iron oxide (in our case sintered pellets of natural iron ore, Fe 2 O 3) is used in one cycle, before further processing in a blast furnace, and (ii) a continuous system, in which specially developed iron oxides (in our case an ammonia catalyst) are cycled between a reduction and oxidation reactor. By injecting pyrolysis oil in a fluidized bed filled with Fe 3 O 4 at 800 °C, {{it has been shown}} that CO and H 2 as well as coke by the gasification reactions contribute to the reduction. Experiments including a complete redox cycle with the ammonia catalyst have shown that a hydrogen production in the oxidation of 0. 84 N m 3 /kg dry pyrolysis oil (LHV H 2 /LHV oil = 0. 4) can be obtained when the conversion of iron oxides are low (1. 0 %). The gas produced in the reduction step under these conditions contains 38 % of the heating value of the input and has an LHV of 7. 8 MJ/N m 3 gas product. Deactivation of the iron oxides has been observed by a decreasing reduction rate in subsequent redox cycles.

Conventional steam reforming of these biomass derived streams is economically unattractive because of their high water contents (> 80 wt%) and the energy required to carry out the reactions in gas phase. Aqueous phase reforming (APR) is a recently developed process and shows promising results for gasification of biomass derived aqueous feeds in liquid phase. During APR, water is kept in the liquid phase by applying elevated pressures. The exact reaction conditions of APR have a huge influence on the properties of water, which in turn affect the catalytic reforming reaction. Earlier work in this field shows the need for stable and active reforming catalysts to make APR of bio/organic aqueous waste streams a commercially feasible process. The study described in this thesis focuses on the development of such a catalyst. The main achievements of the work described in this thesis, involved the development of a stable catalyst support for APR in sub- and supercritical water, which formed the basis for the design of an efficient APR catalyst for reforming of challenging model compounds.

40|$|Between 1920 and 1950 an <b>oil</b> <b>gasification</b> plant {{operated}} on a property adjacent to Kettle Creek about 0. 2 km {{from the mouth}} of Port Stanley harbour on Lake Erie, Ontario, Canada. Oil tar wastes from the gasification plant were stored on the site until it was eventually abandoned in 1987. At that time the Ontario Ministry of the Environment (MOE) determined that the site was contaminated with heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and that some of this waste had been flowing into Kettle Creek through the George Street drain in the village of Port Stanley for an undetermined period of time. The site was completely remediated in 1995 and the flow of contaminated water from the drain ceased. However, sediment sampling revealed the presence of heavy metals and PAHs in Kettle Creek, the inner and outer harbours, and in Lake Erie. From a drinking water source protection perspective, there was an interest in identifying the oil tar contaminants and assessing contaminated sediment transport within the Elgin Area Water Treatment Plant intake protection zones (IPZs). The effectiveness of conventional treatment processes currently available within Elgin Area Water Treatment Plant (WTP) in removing these contaminants was also evaluated. According to historical monitoring data from various compartments including soil, sediment, groundwater and surface water, three types of contaminants were identified, including heavy metals (Sb, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Ni, Se, V and Zn), PAHs and volatile organics (benzene, toluene, phenols). Due to extremely low toxicity and exposure probability, some unregulated contaminants (iron, vanadium, zinc, phenol and some PAHs) were removed from the final contaminant list and were not discussed from the perspective of treatment. A technique developed by the USEPA to characterize and track contaminant plumes in water, the fingerprint analysis of leachate contaminants (FALCON), was for the first time investigated for its suitability as a tool to assist with the interpretation of contaminated sediment transport in surface water originating from a former oil/coal gasification plant and its potential to help assess drinking water intake protection zones. A source fingerprint based on 4 heavy metals (As, Cr, Pb, Ni) and 6 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from 12 sampling sites in a contaminant-impacted harbour was generated. This source fingerprint of the contaminated harbour sediments was then compared to 48 fingerprints generated at other sites in the vicinity of two intake protection zones of a drinking water treatment plant. The source fingerprint did not match fingerprints of sites upstream from the contaminant input source in the creek which fed the small harbour and other potential contamination sources to the east and west in the lake. However, the source fingerprint did match most sites in an outer harbour and some outside the harbour break walls, including sediments collected from within the drinking water intake pipe ~ 3 km to the east of the harbour. A high correlation between water intake sediments and the source fingerprint demonstrated that contaminated sediments have reached water intake. However, no exceedances of the target contaminants were reported in intake surface water in the period from 1990 – 2010. It was also found that the correlation between the source fingerprint and those in the intake has been decreasing over the period for which data are available, confirming the success of remediation efforts. Surface water monitoring has demonstrated that PAH concentrations are lower than detection limits and only iron (Fe) exceeds the Ontario Drinking Water Quality Standards (ODWQS) aesthetic objective. The concentrations of oil tar contaminants in treated water were all below the MOE regulated concentrations, indicating that the current Elgin Area Water Treatment Plant configuration is effectively removing any oil tar contaminants present in raw water. Critical raw water concentrations (CRWCs), which represent maximum raw water concentrations that can reliably be removed by the Elgin WTP, were predicted for each oil tar contaminant. The probability of each contaminant exceeding the CRWC was then estimated using a Log Pearson Type III distribution. Copper was found to be the contaminant with the highest exceedance probability. A point system was designed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of other treatment alternatives and to select the most appropriate of these to improve the robustness of the WTP. Granular activated carbon (GAC) was determined to be the most cost-effective compared to other techniques and hence is considered as the most suitable technique to be implemented in the plant in order to improve its robustness as it relates to dissolved heavy metal species and PAHs...|$|E

Empty Fruit Bunch (EFB), Palm Oil Fiber (POF) and Palm Oil Shell (POS) were initially analyzed by using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA).

40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of {{an increase in}} greenhouse gas levels, specially CO 2, raises concerns regarding {{the quality of life for}} future generations. Renewable energy sources such as biomass could contribute to solve this issue. Effective use of this available biofuel would improve the world’s ability to reduce toxic air transmissions, greenhouse gases, and its dependence on <b>oil</b> supply. <b>Gasification</b> arises as a potential alternative for converting biomass into a clean fuel. With the addition of steam as a gasifying agent, the problem on nitrogen in the syngas is neglected. This research work investigated the effects of temperature, oxidizing agent and biomass composition in the quality of syngas from steam biomass gasification. Gasification of wood pellets, broza and bark was carried out with changes in temperature from 550 °C to 600 °C. The atmosphere for gasification was also varied using He and CO 2. Gasification of biomass materials are performed in a CREC Riser Simulator Reactor Unit under the expected conditions of a twin circulating fluidized bed gasifier. Steam gasification performance was affected by changes in temperature, as well as endothermic reactions involved in the process. Thus, higher temperature favored steam reforming and carbon conversion with modest changes due the biomass type. The atmosphere in which gasification was carried out was found also to have an impact in the produced syngas. Gasification of biomass under a water-CO 2 atmosphere reached higher dry gas yields compared to steam gasification under water-helium. It is hypothesized that the decrease in the H 2 yield was driven by the reverse water gas shift reaction. This study also revealed the importance of the catalytic effect of the ash content in biomass. Ash content affects the quality of syngas, with high-quality synthesis gas (H 2 /CO 3 ̆e 2) suitable for direct alcohol synthesis, obtained under water-helium atmospheres. Changes in the gasification product yields and their variation with operating parameters are found to be in general agreement with the chemical equilibrium predictions. Moreover, product yields approach chemical equilibrium as the ash content in biomass is larger. In this respect, syngas yields from water-helium and water CO 2 gasification of broza, with an ash content of 12...|$|R

However, in case of low density feedstock, such as agricultural crop straws, softwood chips, rice husk, etc., the flow is adversely affected by bridging and as a consequence the stability and results of the process can be hampered. In this study, a novel method is introduced for solving the problem of bridging in <b>oil</b> palm fronds <b>gasification</b> process. For the process of gasification single throat downdraft gasifier was used. In the experiment, after feeding the gasifier with 9 kg of oil palm fronds, 4 kg of 7 metal scraps were placed on top of the feedstock in order to increase the weight and enhance the downward flow. By applying metal scraps the problem of bridging was solved and stable gasification process was obtained. As a result of stable operation of the process, the percentage of combustible components of the syngas was improved. CO was increased from 15. 4 to 22. 8, CH 4 from 1. 7 to 1. 9 and H 2 from 8. 4 to 9. 6 in volume percentage. In addition, higher heating value was increased from 3. 7 to 4. 8 MJ Nm - 3 and equivalent ratio was decreased from 0. 29 to 0. 27. The average oxidation temperature in the oxidation zone was also improved from 623 to 828 °C...|$|R
