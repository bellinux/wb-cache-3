To examine the relationships of sleep-disordered breathing with blood pressure levels and excessive daytime sleepiness among truck drivers, we conducted a population-based cross-sectional study of 1, 313 subjects aged 20 − 69 years registered in the Japanese Trucking Association. The 3 % <b>oxygen</b> desaturation <b>index</b> was selected as an indicator of sleep-disordered breathing, representing the number of desaturation events per hour of recording time in which blood oxygen fell by ≥ 3 % by overnight pulse oximetry. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale was used to estimate excessive daytime sleepiness. There were significant positive associations between the 3 % <b>oxygen</b> desaturation <b>index</b> levels and both diastolic blood pressure levels and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores. The multivariate odds ratio of hypertension was 2. 0 (1. 1 − 3. 6) for a 3 % <b>oxygen</b> desaturation <b>index</b> of ≥ 15 in reference with a 3 % <b>oxygen</b> desaturation <b>index</b> of < 5. This association was more evident among those aged ≥ 40 years and overweight subjects.

50|$|Vinyl siding {{features}} a chlorine base, making it inherently slow to ignite and flame retardant. All organic materials (that is, anything containing carbon) will ignite, but {{the higher the}} temperature a material has to reach before it flames, the safer it is. PVC won’t ignite, even from another flame, until it reaches about 730°F (387°C) and won’t self-ignite until about 850°F (454°C). Those ignition temperatures are significantly higher than common framing lumber, which ignites from a flame at 500°F (260°C) and self-ignites at 770°F (410°C). Also, ASTM D2863 tests show that rigid PVC’s high Limiting <b>Oxygen</b> <b>Index</b> means that it needs unusually high amounts of oxygen to burn and stay burning. Rigid PVC (vinyl siding) will not independently sustain combustion in air with a normal concentration of oxygen (about 21 percent) — so it extinguishes more easily.|$|E

The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of adenotonsillectomy {{for the treatment of}} the disorder as well as the improvement of their post-operative quality of life. Five patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apneas and adenotonsillar hypertrophy of grade III-IV underwent adenotonsillectomy. Pre- and postoperative apneas and Quality of Life were assessed respectively with a polysomnography with multi-sleep latency test and with the pediatric Quality of Life questionnaire, performed before and 6 months after surgery. A decrease of apnea/hypopnea index values has been detected between pre- and post-surgery (t= 2. 64, P= 0. 005), as well as <b>oxygen</b> desaturation <b>index</b> values (t= 5. 51, P= 0. 005), multi-sleep latency test (t= 4. 54, P= 0. 01), and of the values of pediatric Quality of Life questionnaire.

40|$|AbstractAimThe {{objective}} {{of the current study}} is to find out and correlate the predictive value of serum lactate level and other oxygenation indices in the first 24  h of respiratory ICU admission regarding mortality and length of ICU stay. MethodsThirty three critically ill patients were enrolled. Three samples of lactate and concomitant arterial blood gases (ABG) were obtained. One on admission, one after 12 h and one after 24 h of admission. ResultsTwenty patients survived and 13 patients died. A comparison was done between survivors and non survivors regarding <b>oxygen</b> <b>indices</b> and serum lactate. Mean serum lactate was significantly lower in survivors than non survivors in the three samples. In all studied samples, survivors’ group had better <b>oxygen</b> <b>indices</b> {{in the form of a}} lower A-a gradient, higher pulse O 2 saturation and higher oxygen content but did not reach statistical significance except in sample 3 where A-a gradient was significantly lower in survivors. Mean serum lactate was positively correlated with the length of hospital stay as well as A-a O 2 gradient with statistical significant difference. Serum lactate in the three samples was shown to be significantly accurate in predicting non survivors. Cut-off values were 3. 76 mmol/L, 3. 08 mmol/L, and 2. 92 mmol/L respectively; sensitivity 88. 9 %, 88. 9 %, and 100 % respectively; and specificity 95 %, 75 %, and 70 % respectively.
