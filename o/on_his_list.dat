When Thomas first viewed the scene with his wife, she emitted an audible groan when she saw Logan walking through the cafeteria towards Piz, anticipating the fight {{that was about to}} come. Thomas thought that most fight scenes on the show were not well-done, as they are filmed quickly and without a second unit. However, he was pleased with the final cut, stating that there was only one punch that he thought looked fake.|$|E
5|$|For his 1896 {{attempt to}} launch the balloon, Andrée had many eager volunteers to choose from. He picked Nils Gustaf Ekholm (1848–1923), an {{experienced}} Arctic meteorological researcher and formerly his boss during an 1882–83 geophysical expedition to Spitsbergen, and Nils Strindberg (1872–97), a brilliant student who was doing original research in physics and chemistry. The main scientific purpose of the expedition was to map the area by means of aerial photography, and Strindberg was both a devoted amateur photographer and a skilled constructor of advanced cameras. This was a team with many useful scientific and technical skills, but lacking any particular physical prowess or training for survival under extreme conditions. All three men were indoor types, and only one, Strindberg, was young. Andrée expected a sedentary voyage in a balloon basket, and strength and survival skills were far down <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>list.</b>|$|E

Ron Hubbard's science fiction novels. Hubbard's novel Battlefield Earth was first <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>list,</b> and Travolta starred in and helped fund the film version of the book which was released in 2000.

5|$|Taft {{was opposed}} to the {{traditional}} practice of rewarding wealthy supporters with key ambassadorial posts, preferring that diplomats not live in a lavish lifestyle and selecting men who, as Taft put it, would recognize an American when they saw one. High <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>list</b> for dismissal was the ambassador to France, Henry White, whom Taft knew and disliked from his visits to Europe. White's ousting caused other career State Department employees to fear that their jobs might be lost to politics. Taft also wanted to replace the Roosevelt-appointed ambassador in London, Whitelaw Reid, but Reid, owner of the New-York Tribune, had backed Taft during the campaign, and both William and Nellie Taft enjoyed his gossipy reports. Reid remained in place until his 1912 death.|$|E
5|$|The victory gave Auburn fans {{hope that}} if Oklahoma won the 2005 BCS National Championship Game, a split {{national}} championship would result. By contract, {{the winner of the}} BCS National Championship Game is voted number one in the USA Today Coaches' Poll. In contrast, the Associated Press poll has no such restriction. Auburn's thin margin of victory over Tech put the prospect of split national title in doubt, though not out of reach. USC's blowout 55–19 victory over Oklahoma, however, made it likely that USC would be the overwhelming choice for first place. When the final college football polls of the season were released, USC was voted number one by a large margin, though three voters in the Associated Press poll voted Auburn first. More than three years after the game, ESPN sportswriter Ted Miller rated the game second <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>list</b> of victims of the BCS system, just behind USC being left out of the championship game in 2003.|$|E
