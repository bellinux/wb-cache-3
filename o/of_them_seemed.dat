5|$|Hughes then {{signed a}} multi-fight {{deal with the}} UFC. Hughes {{defeated}} Renzo Gracie, the 1st cousin once removed of his opponent at UFC 60, via third round TKO at , setting the record for most UFC wins with 17. Both <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>seemed</b> very comfortable fighting on their feet in the early going, with Gracie landing the cleaner and more effective punches and also landing a couple of kicks. Hughes started the second round with powerful leg kicks, but after that Gracie returned to his in-and-out punching style. Hughes got double underhooks and managed to take Gracie down briefly. In the final round Hughes connected with a right hook to Gracie's chin, then connected with a leg kick and another punch. With two minutes to go he knocked Gracie down with a leg kick. Gracie took {{all the time he}} could before Hughes helped him up and then dropped him with a second leg kick. Gracie stalled again, but when he finally stood up Hughes floored him with a punch, let him get up and then attacked again. Hughes knocked Gracie down again with a fourth punch, when referee Herb Dean ended it.|$|E
500|$|The Seinfeld Chronicles {{featured}} four {{characters that}} {{were intended to}} be series regulars if the show was to be picked-up for a first season: Jerry, George, Kramer and Claire the waitress. Though it was already settled that Seinfeld would play a fictionalized version of himself, auditions were held for the other three characters. Though George was based on Larry David, David was keen on writing, {{and did not have}} the desire to portray the character himself. Prior to the casting progress, Seinfeld pleaded with his friend Jake Johannsen to play the part, but he rejected it. When the casting process started, as casting director Marc Hirschfeld stated, the casting crew [...] "saw every actor [...] could possibly see in Los Angeles". Among these actors were Larry Miller, Brad Hall, David Alan Grier, and Nathan Lane yet none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>seemed</b> fit for the part. Jason Alexander auditioned for the part via a video tape, though he had very little hope for being cast, as he felt he was doing a Woody Allen impression. However, upon watching the tape, David and Seinfeld were immediately convinced Alexander would be the right actor to cast. However, traditionally casting sessions work with rounds, so Alexander and a few other actors considered for the role were flown to Los Angeles for a second audition. One of the other actors who made it to this round was Larry Miller. As Alexander knew Miller was a close friend of Seinfeld, he was convinced he would not get the part, but eventually did.|$|E

His 1665 New Experiments and Observations touching Cold, articulated the dispute known as the primum frigidum. The concept was well known among naturalists of the time.
