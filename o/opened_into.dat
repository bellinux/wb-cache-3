5|$|National Register of Historic Places {{nomination}} {{states that}} {{the interior of the}} building originally <b>opened</b> <b>into</b> a large meeting hall with some auxiliary service rooms {{at the rear of the}} building, but did not disclose any alterations made to the interior.|$|E
5|$|A service ramp at {{the rear}} of the {{basement}} led to a sliding door that <b>opened</b> <b>into</b> an alley; the police found the door had been tampered with so it could be opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door, as well as a metal pipe that had been used as a crowbar. Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.|$|E
5|$|The Presidio {{was built}} to {{standard}} plans for a Spanish colonial military headquarters, using locally available materials, so the buildings forming the outer square were constructed with thick, solid adobe outer walls. The main gate <b>opened</b> <b>into</b> an open parade ground/plaza {{in the center of}} the square. The chapel stood at the center of the back of the square, facing the gate across the plaza. While it was never attacked by a strong military force during its sixty years of operation, the Presidio was subject to the assaults of nature. Several devastating earthquakes in the early 19th century destroyed much of the structure.|$|E
25|$|The gate {{opens to}} the north and faces towards Kashmir. This gate <b>opens</b> <b>into</b> one chamber which <b>opens</b> <b>into</b> another.|$|R
50|$|The {{mouth of}} {{gastropods}} <b>opens</b> <b>into</b> an oesophagus, which {{connects to the}} stomach. Because of torsion, the oesophagus usually passes around the stomach, and <b>opens</b> <b>into</b> its posterior portion, furthest from the mouth. In species that have undergone de-torsion, however, the oesophagus may <b>open</b> <b>into</b> the anterior of the stomach, which is therefore reversed from the usual gastropod arrangement.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} entrances into the building. Ledge and brace doors <b>open</b> <b>into</b> {{the west and}} east {{elevations}}. At the south elevation, there is an opening into a small porch. Two four paned sash windows <b>open</b> <b>into</b> the south and north elevations at the east end. Rows of small, high, frosted glass windows <b>open</b> <b>into</b> the south and north elevations at the lavatory end.|$|R
5|$|The {{victims were}} gassed with diesel exhaust {{from the engine}} of a Red Army tank. SS-Scharführer Erich Fuchs was {{responsible}} for installing it. The engine was brought in by the SS {{at the time of}} the camp's construction and housed in a room with a generator that supplied the camp with electricity. The tank engine exhaust pipe ran just below the ground and <b>opened</b> <b>into</b> all three gas chambers. The fumes could be seen seeping out. After about 20 minutes the bodies were removed by dozens of Sonderkommandos, placed onto carts and wheeled away. The system was imperfect and required a lot of effort; trains that arrived later in the day had to wait on layover tracks overnight at Treblinka, Małkinia, or Wólka Okrąglik.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Stoa {{was built}} upon the artificially raised {{portion of the}} Temple Mount platform. Arches {{underneath}} supported the columns of the Stoa, and provided service areas for the structures above. The Huldah Gates {{at the bottom of}} the southern wall led through corridors beneath the Stoa, rising to the Temple plaza, and served as the main entrance to the Temple compound for worshipers. Additional passages led to storage areas, and possibly provided secondary access to the Stoa and the Temple beyond. An arched overpass on the eastern side of the Temple Mount led to a gate which <b>opened</b> <b>into</b> the so-called Solomon's Stables just beneath the eastern end of the Stoa. It is widely assumed that at least part of this area was used as a storage area in conjunction with business conducted in the Stoa.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the early}} hours of September6, Nate became quasi-stationary under a weak {{steering}} pattern between Hurricane Maria and a disturbance over The Bahamas. Satellite imagery indicated that the cloud pattern continued to organize with excellent outflow surrounding the storm. Late on September6 a developing banding eye feature became evident. Tropical Storm Nate strengthened further and became a hurricane at 1200 UTCon September7, as it began to turn away from Bermuda. Some models indicated that Nate could have been either absorbed by or merged with the larger Hurricane Maria, but the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast that Nate would survive as a separate system, which it did. The large low to the northeast of The Bahamas gradually <b>opened</b> <b>into</b> a broad trough as a shortwave trough approached from the northwest. The larger trough slowly became elongated in a northeast–southwest manner late on September7. At the same time, the shortwave trough moved southward along {{the west side of the}} other trough. The increasing southwesterly flow along the southeast side of the broad trough caused Nate to accelerate northeastward. Nate reached its peak intensity of 90mph (145km/h) late on September8 as it passed 120miles (205km) southeast of Bermuda, while its strongest winds remained well offshore.|$|E
50|$|The main {{entrance}} is a wooden paneled {{door with a}} brass knocker. The arched vestibule it <b>opens</b> <b>into</b> has the original floor tiles. Another transomed doorway <b>opens</b> <b>into</b> the living room, with a fireplace on the north wall.|$|R
50|$|Pearse Strait is a {{waterway}} in the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, Canada. It separates Île Vanier (to the north) from Massey Island (to the south). To the west, {{the strait}} <b>opens</b> <b>into</b> the Byam Martin Channel, {{and to the}} east it <b>opens</b> <b>into</b> the Erskine Inlet.|$|R

25|$|Transportation vice-minister Laure Marie Kawanda Kayena {{stated that}} an {{investigation}} had been <b>opened</b> <b>into</b> the accident. According {{to a government}} spokesman, {{there has been no}} confirmation that fuel shortage caused the crash.|$|E
25|$|This {{work at the}} end of the 19th century <b>opened</b> <b>into</b> several {{successive}} {{versions of}} the theorem. The general case was first proved in 1910 by Jacques Hadamard and by Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer.|$|E
25|$|In 1972 an {{extension}} of the M1 was <b>opened</b> <b>into</b> central Leeds as the Leeds South Eastern Motorway where it met the Leeds South Western Motorway (M621) coming north-east from the M62 at Junction 3.|$|E
50|$|The Hardau valley {{eventually}} <b>opens</b> <b>into</b> the Gerdau valley.|$|R
50|$|The anus and {{genitals}} <b>open</b> <b>into</b> {{the mantle}} cavity.|$|R
50|$|A stone {{architrave}} {{similar to}} the other door and window surrounds surmounts the original paired wooden doors at the main entrance. They have their original iron hinges and transom with wooden tracery. They <b>open</b> <b>into</b> a vestibule {{on the first floor}} of the bell tower, which in turn <b>opens</b> <b>into</b> the sanctuary.|$|R
25|$|Once melted, {{the glass}} would be blown into vessels or into {{cylinders}} which then were <b>opened</b> <b>into</b> sheets for window glass.The final stage is to anneal the finished glass {{to avoid damage}} from shrinkage stresses.|$|E
25|$|The south wall has {{pieces of}} the cluster of round pillars of the {{original}} Norman church, which were removed in 1828 and inserted in the wall when it was heightened. The large arch, which <b>opened</b> <b>into</b> the chantry, is now filled in.|$|E
25|$|An {{investigation}} was <b>opened</b> <b>into</b> the accident by the Accidents Investigation Branch of the Air Ministry, with Major Cooper in charge. The investigation {{concluded that the}} accident was caused by pilot error. The aircraft had stalled whilst a precautionary landing was being attempted.|$|E
50|$|The {{anterior}} cardiac veins (or anterior {{veins of}} right ventricle) comprise {{three or four}} small vessels which collect blood {{from the front of}} the right ventricle and <b>open</b> <b>into</b> the right atrium; the right marginal vein frequently <b>opens</b> <b>into</b> the right atrium, and is therefore sometimes regarded as belonging to this group.|$|R
5000|$|The Humboldt Channel (...) is {{a natural}} {{waterway}} through the central Canadian Arctic Archipelago in Kitikmeot Region, Nunavut. It separates King William Island (to the west) from the Tennent Islands (to the east). To the north the strait <b>opens</b> <b>into</b> the James Ross Strait; to the south it <b>opens</b> <b>into</b> the Rae Strait.|$|R
50|$|The {{front door}} <b>opens</b> <b>into</b> a {{passageway}} one room deep, from which, on the right, a door <b>opens</b> <b>into</b> a small front 1920s room. At {{the end of}} the passageway a door on the left <b>opens</b> <b>into</b> an arched, internal vestibule from which doors open to the large 1890s front room on the left, to the adjoining 1890s front bedroom {{on the north side of}} the vestibule, to the back verandah, and to a large 1920s room on the right. Dividing this space is a solid timber archway with central pendant. On the rear verandah side there is a skylight.|$|R
25|$|In June 2010, a Swedish public {{prosecutor}} said an inquiry was being <b>opened</b> <b>into</b> {{whether any of}} Lundin's Swedish employees broke the law. The investigation was triggered by an 8 June 2010 report published by the European Coalition on Oil in the Sudan, an NGO based in the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|Outwards {{expansion}} also continued, {{with major}} trunk lines being <b>opened</b> <b>into</b> rural Victoria. Victorian Railways extended their line to Broadmeadows in 1872 {{as part of}} the line to Seymour and Albury-Wodonga. In 1879 the Gippsland line was opened from South Yarra to Caulfield, Pakenham and Bairnsdale.|$|E
25|$|At the contest, the Tolmachevy Sisters {{were joined}} on stage by four backing vocalists: Anna Nilsson, Jenny Tärneberg, Anna Strandberg and Rui Andrade. The Russian {{performance}} featured the Tolmachevy Sisters performing with long translucent sticks and interacting with a platform that moved like a balance and eventually <b>opened</b> <b>into</b> a white sun-like canvas.|$|E
50|$|They {{occasionally}} <b>open</b> <b>into</b> the facial, lingual, or superior thyroid vein.|$|R
50|$|Boyer Strait is a {{waterway}} in the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, Canada. It separates Massey Island (to the north) from Alexander Island (to the south). Île Marc {{is located}} at the western end of the strait, beyond which it <b>opens</b> <b>into</b> the Byam Martin Channel. To the east it <b>opens</b> <b>into</b> the Erskine Inlet.|$|R

A second set of doors <b>open</b> <b>into</b> the central hall of the double-pile plan interior. It {{is dominated by the}} main staircase, finely crafted with a carved newel and balustrade. The plaster ceiling has a cornice.|$|R
25|$|Following his arrest, a 23-year-old protester, Valeriu Boboc, {{died in a}} Chişinău {{hospital}} on 8 April 2009. The official cause was smoke poisoning from the riot, but his family insisted that he was beaten to death by the police, his body being full of contusions. An investigation was <b>opened</b> <b>into</b> the case and a policeman was arrested on charges of Boboc's murder. As of November 2010, the case is still ongoing.|$|E
25|$|On 24 September 2017, an Italian Air Force {{aircraft}} {{crashed into}} the sea during an airshow in Terracina, Lazio, Italy. The pilot Capt. Gabriele Orlandi did not eject and died in the accident. The Italian Air Force said the jet completed a loop but then failed to get enough lift as it approached sea level and hit the water {{just a few hundred}} meters offshore. The body of the pilot was recovered soon after. An investigation was <b>opened</b> <b>into</b> the cause.|$|E
25|$|The {{main house}} was rebuilt by William Douglas, 3rd Duke of Hamilton in 1677 with a uniform facade {{and a pair}} of stone {{staircases}} at the ends. He sent his plans to help William Douglas, 1st Duke of Queensberry with his building works, which included Drumlanrig Castle in Dumfriesshire and Queensberry House in Edinburgh. An inventory of 1688 gives the names of rooms in the now gutted main house. The front door <b>opened</b> <b>into</b> a Laich Hall, and a grand stair to the south led to the dining room above. The same arrangement can still be seen at the contemporary Argyll's Lodging, Stirling.|$|E
50|$|A smaller {{weatherboard}} shed {{is attached}} to {{the north side of the}} mechanical workshop. This is the electrical workshop. A small weatherboard alcove projects from the northern side of the building. Sash windows <b>open</b> <b>into</b> the northern and southern sides of the building. A small two-paned window <b>opens</b> <b>into</b> the alcove. The building has no external doors.|$|R
50|$|All three {{entry doors}} <b>open</b> <b>into</b> the same narthex, with stairs {{leading to a}} full-width {{platform}} where doors opposite them <b>open</b> <b>into</b> the sanctuary.
