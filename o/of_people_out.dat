500|$|Off {{the coast}} of Florida, the storm {{generated}} rough sea conditions with waves of up to 5ft (1.9 m); high surf lightly injured several swimmers and surfers in Brevard County. Strong rip currents swept dozens <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> to sea, but all remained unharmed and were quickly rescued. Additionally, the waves washed ashore venomous jellyfish that stung more than 200 people near coastal beaches. Scattered funnel clouds and waterspouts were reported overseas, though the phenomena dissipated soon thereafter without affecting land. Onshore, Bret's effects were minimal; weak morning showers and breezy winds briefly brushed Brevard and Volusia Counties. As the storm lifted out of the area, it drew in a large mass of dry air, limiting chances of much-needed rain to subdue a large wildfire in the Okefenokee Swamp.|$|E

500|$|The second commandment {{prohibits the}} use of God's name in vain. Many ancient {{cultures}} believed that names were sacred; some had prohibitions on when a person's name could be spoken. The Gospel of John relates an incident {{where a group of}} Jews attempted to stone Jesus after he used a sacred name of God to refer to himself. They interpreted his statement as a claim of divinity. [...] Since they did not believe that he was God, they considered this blasphemy, which under Mosaic law carries a death penalty. Kreeft writes that all of the names by which God is known are holy, and thus all of those names are protected by the second commandment. The Catechism states, [...] "Respect for his name is an expression of the respect owed to the mystery of God himself and to the whole sacred reality it evokes." [...] The Catechism also requires respect for the names <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> of respect for the dignity of that person.|$|E

In his song review {{for the same}} website, Richie Unterberger is unimpressed with the track; while acknowledging that [...] "Love You To" [...] was [...] "Undoubtedly... another indication of the group's rapidly broadening barriers", he cites a lead vocal that [...] "drone on in a rather lugubrious way", Harrison's slightly [...] "disheveled" [...] sitar playing, and lyrics that constitute [...] "a rather muddled mix of free love advocacy, meditations on the transience of life on Earth, and chip-on-the-shoulder wariness <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> to exploit him". Although he finds the melody [...] "sourly repetitious", Ian MacDonald writes that the track is [...] "distinguished by the authenticity of its Hindustani classical instrumentation and techniques", and admires Harrison's understanding of the genre. In a 2009 review for Paste magazine, Mark Kemp described Revolver as the album on which the Beatles [...] "completed their transformation from the mop tops of three years earlier into bold, groundbreaking experimental rockers", and added: [...] "Harrison's 'Love You To' is pure Indian raga – sitar and tablas punctuated by the occasional luminous guitar riff jolting through the song's paranoid, drug-fueled lyrics like a blinding ray of sun into a dark forest." ...|$|E
