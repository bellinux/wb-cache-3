Lundigran criticized {{the manner in}} which romantic interactions play out, stating that [...] "considering that the love story is so integral to everything that happens—not to mention forming the central image of the box art—it's incomprehensible why no one says 'I love you' to anyone, ever". With Squall, he felt that [...] "FFVIII does break one cardinal rule: when your story is character centered, you'd better center it on a character the audience can care about. Squall, unfortunately, just doesn't fit the bill". However, GameSpot felt that Final Fantasy VIII shifts the story from the [...] "epic" [...] concepts of Final Fantasy VII to the [...] "personal", in that [...] "the characters and their relationships are all extremely believable and complex; moreover, the core romance holds up even under the most pessimistic scrutiny". A later editorial by IGN's Ryan Clements echoed this sentiment, appreciating that Squall and Rinoa's single kiss during the finale serves [...] "one of the player's main rewards for hours of dedication". Although the reviewer at Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine acknowledged possible fears over a romantic storyline, he stated that [...] "it's only later in the game, <b>once</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> really attached to all the distinct and complex characters, that the more emotional themes are gradually introduced".|$|E

If you get called for three seconds then you will be penalized and a player from the other team {{will be allowed to}} take a free shot against the goalie. If you are an attacker trying to shoot the ball into the goal, you are not supposed to take a shot while a defender is in [...] "shooting space."

2500|$|Ed Sheeran {{has spoken}} about his support her Sandé and her music, {{saying that she}} has {{spent a lot of}} time on the record and that it could be as big as Adele's second album, 21, which has sold over 27 million records worldwide. Sandé {{revealed}} that she wanted to bring poetry back into music, as it has been lost. The songs which are currently being released are for the [...] "moment" [...] as they make us feel good and we can dance to them, Sandé said. She said that Our Version of Events will see poetry lyrics, as she intends to bring them back into fashion. She said; Great songwriters come along quite rarely, but when I listen to Tracy Chapman or Joni Mitchell, these are people who pay attention to the lyric and are precise about it. I feel that has been put second to having a cool producer or whether the kids will like it. She said that the music industry is hard to get into, but <b>once</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in, it is very loyal. In the recording studio, Syco Music heard some of Sandé's songs which they wanted, but she refused and told them she wanted to keep them for her own album. They later asked her to write for some of their artists, and Leona Lewis went into the studio with her and Naughty Boy to record for a couple of weeks, and she said that her and Lewis had a lot in common. She also said that Lewis has a phenomenal voice and she was lovely.|$|E
