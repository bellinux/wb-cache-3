5000|$|The role of {{occupational}} therapists {{in the workplace}} is to facilitate individuals’ ability to return to work. Occupational therapists assist their clients in reaching their maximum level of function {{with the aim of}} meeting the physical and emotional demands of their job. Occupational therapists are also qualified to make recommendations to employers on how to downgrade job demands to meet the functional status of an employee in order to prevent further injury during <b>occupational</b> <b>rehabilitation.</b> Individual functional capacity evaluations are used to screen for person-environment fit. Industrial occupational therapists use a collaborative approach involving the workers and employers to encourage a supportive work environment that empowers the worker to reach productivity and other work related goals.
