5|$|The {{turning point}} of the match came with ten minutes left. After a period of fluent {{football}} by the Arsenal forwards which saw Smith hit the woodwork and Hayes, Thomas and Rocastle all had shots saved by Dibble, Arsenal were awarded a penalty after Rocastle was fouled in the box. Dibble saved Winterburn's spot-kick by turning the ball round the post. A newly inspired Luton equalised with seven minutes remaining when Caesar mis-kicked a clearance <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> penalty area, enabling Luton's Wilson to head {{the ball into the}} Arsenal goal from a Mark Stein cross. With less than a minute to go, Adams fouled Mark Stein, and from the resulting free kick, Brian Stein scored his second goal of the match to put the game {{beyond the reach of the}} defending champions.|$|E

Teammates shouted at Moore to just get rid of the ball, but he calmly picked out the feet of Hurst 40yards(40m) upfield, who scored to bring the score to 4–2.|$|E
