5|$|Low-dose aspirin use irreversibly {{blocks the}} {{formation}} of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8–9 days). This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in {{people who have had}} a heart attack, unstable angina, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. 40mg <b>of</b> <b>aspirin</b> a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses <b>of</b> <b>aspirin</b> are required to attain further inhibition.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin is an {{effective}} analgesic for acute pain, but is generally considered inferior to ibuprofen for the alleviation of pain because aspirin {{is more likely to}} cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle cramps, bloating, gastric distension, or acute skin irritation. As with other NSAIDs, combinations <b>of</b> <b>aspirin</b> and caffeine provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone. Effervescent formulations <b>of</b> <b>aspirin,</b> such as Alka-Seltzer or Blowfish, relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets, which makes them useful for the treatment of migraines. Topical aspirin may be effective for treating some types of neuropathic pain.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is known}} to {{interact}} with other drugs. For example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin {{is known to}} displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, {{an important part of}} valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration <b>of</b> <b>aspirin.</b> Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect <b>of</b> <b>aspirin</b> used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.|$|E

5|$|Between World War I and World War II, {{many new}} aspirin brands and aspirin-based {{products}} entered the market. The Australian company Nicholas Proprietary Limited, through the aggressive marketing strategies of George Davies, built Aspro {{into a global}} brand, with particular strength in Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K. American brands such as Burton's Aspirin, Molloy's Aspirin, Cal-Aspirin and St. Joseph Aspirin tried {{to compete with the}} American Bayer, while new products such Cafaspirin (aspirin with caffeine) and Alka-Seltzer (a soluble mix <b>of</b> <b>aspirin</b> and bicarbonate of soda) put aspirin to new uses. In 1925, the German Bayer became part of IG Farben, a conglomerate of former dye companies; IG Farben's brands <b>of</b> <b>Aspirin</b> and, in Latin America, the caffeinated Cafiaspirina (co-managed with Sterling Products) competed with less expensive aspirins such as Geniol.|$|E
5|$|Both {{dogs and}} horses are {{susceptible}} to the gastrointestinal side effects associated with salicylates, {{but it is a}} convenient treatment for arthritis in older dogs, and has shown some promise in cases of laminitis in horses. It is no longer commonly used for cases of laminitis, as it could be counterproductive for treatment. Aspirin should be used in animals only under the direct supervision of a veterinarian; in particular, cats lack the glucuronide conjugates that aid in the excretion <b>of</b> <b>aspirin,</b> making it potentially toxic. No clinical signs of toxicosis occurred when cats were given 25mg/kg <b>of</b> <b>aspirin</b> every 48 hours for 4 weeks.|$|E

40|$|Background: Aspirin and {{clopidogrel}} monotherapies {{are effective}} treatments for preventing vascular disease. However, new evidence has emerged {{regarding the use}} <b>of</b> combined <b>aspirin</b> and clopidogrel therapy to prevent cardiovascular events. We therefore performed a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the benefits and harms <b>of</b> combined <b>aspirin</b> and clopidogrel therapy on major cardiovascular outcomes. Methodology/Principal Findings: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, reference lists of articles, and proceedings of major meetings to identify studies to fit our analysis. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials assessing the effect <b>of</b> combined <b>aspirin</b> and clopidogrel therapy compared with aspirin or clopidogrel monotherapy. We identified 7 trials providing data {{with a total of}} 48248 patients. These studies reporte...|$|R
5|$|For many {{diseases}} of the heart, including atrial fibrillation and valvular disease, and after a heart operation, anticoagulation in the form <b>of</b> <b>aspirin,</b> warfarin, clopidogrel or novel oral anticoagulants is often given simultaneously, because of {{an increased risk of}} stroke or, {{in the context of a}} clotted heart vessel, rethrombosis.|$|E
5|$|Also in {{the early}} 1980s, several studies {{suggested}} a link between children's consumption <b>of</b> <b>aspirin</b> and Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal disease. By 1986, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required warning labels on all aspirin, further suppressing sales. The makers of Tylenol also {{filed a lawsuit against}} Anacin aspirin maker American Home Products, claiming that the failure to add warning labels before 1986 had unfairly held back Tylenol sales, though this suit was eventually dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{can cause}} {{prolonged}} bleeding after operations {{for up to}} 10 days. In one study, 30 of 6499 people having elective surgery required reoperations to control bleeding.

5|$|But they {{overlooked}} that inexpensive aspirin {{had become}} available in India {{and other places}} after October 1918, when the Bayer patent expired. In responding, Starko pointed to anecdotal evidence <b>of</b> <b>aspirin</b> use in India and argued that even if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, it could still have been a factor for other high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.|$|E
5|$|Prostaglandins, local hormones {{produced}} in the body, have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the hypothalamic thermostat, and inflammation.

5|$|The {{synthesis}} <b>of</b> <b>aspirin</b> {{is classified}} as an esterification reaction. Salicylic acid is treated with acetic anhydride, an acid derivative, causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acid's hydroxyl group into an ester group (R-OH → R-OCOCH3). This process yields aspirin and acetic acid, which is considered a byproduct of this reaction. Small amounts of sulfuric acid (and occasionally phosphoric acid) are almost always used as a catalyst. This method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs.|$|E

In particular, such phrases are always ready to form the writer's thoughts for him to save him the bother of thinking, or writing, clearly.

5|$|A {{study of}} a group with a mean dosage <b>of</b> <b>aspirin</b> of 270mg per day {{estimated}} an average absolute risk increase in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) of 12 events per 10,000 persons. In comparison, the estimated absolute risk reduction in myocardial infarction was 137 events per 10,000 persons, and a reduction of 39 events per 10,000 persons in ischemic stroke. In cases where ICH already has occurred, aspirin use results in higher mortality, with a dose of about 250mg per day resulting in a relative risk of death within {{three months after the}} ICH around 2.5 (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 4.6).|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is readily}} broken {{down in the}} body to {{salicylic}} acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate AMP-activated protein kinase, which has been suggested as a possible explanation {{for some of the}} effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin. The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets. Acetylation of cellular proteins is a well-established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post-translational level. Aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to COX isoenzymes. These acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects <b>of</b> <b>aspirin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, and Kawasaki disease.

There is some evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. In the United States low dose aspirin is deemed reasonable in those between 50 and 70 years old who have a more than 10% risk of cardiovascular disease and are not at an increased risk of bleeding who are otherwise healthy.|$|E
