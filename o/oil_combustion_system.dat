Since every molecule of dioxina contains two or more atoms of chlorine, chlorine is an absolute necessity for dioxin formation. Therefore, when no chlorine is present, no dioxins are formed.

Using non-linear embedding theory, recurrence plots (RPs) and recurrence qualification analysis (RQA), the hidden rhythms and dynamic complexity of a <b>combustion</b> <b>system</b> in high dimensional phase space for each gas injection timing (GIT) have been examined, and the possible source of combustion instabilities has been identified based on 3 -D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation.
