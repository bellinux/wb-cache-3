25|$|Reading: to read {{a person}} is to {{highlight}} and exaggerate all of the flaws of a person, from their ridiculous clothes, to their flawed makeup and anything else the reader can come up with.

25|$|University {{management}} itself {{came under}} increasing grassroots pressure to implement change within the university. A Wits-initiated research project, Perspectives <b>of</b> <b>Wits</b> (POW), published in 1986, revealed a surprising disconnect between the perceptions disadvantaged communities had <b>of</b> <b>Wits</b> {{and the image}} Wits had been attempting to convey of itself as a progressive opponent of apartheid. POW, which had involved interviews with members of organisations among disadvantaged communities in the PWV area, international academics, students and staff at Wits, and even {{a meeting with the}} then-banned ANC in Lusaka, revealed that to many in the surrounding disadvantaged communities, there was a perception <b>of</b> <b>Wits</b> as an elitist institution dominated by white interests. A need was identified for further transformation of the university.|$|R

25|$|In a September 2009 storyline {{which many}} readers also {{interpreted}} as Batiuk's addressing of the strip's latter-day bleakness, {{a group of}} parents protested a school production <b>of</b> <b>Wit</b> because the themes of cancer and death offended them. In her defense of the play, the character of Susan Smith, a Westview High teacher and drama director, was viewed by critics as a mouthpiece for Batiuk's views {{on the importance of}} dramatic entertainment.|$|E

25|$|Brian McCarty (1974) is a {{contemporary}} artist and photographer {{known for his}} work with toys. McCarty's approach is based upon integrating toy characters into real-life situations {{through the use of}} forced perspective in carefully crafted scenes. Preferring to work in-camera and without compositing, McCarty creates his photographs by sometimes traveling to exotic locations, including active war zones. Although grounded in reality, because of his use <b>of</b> <b>wit</b> and whimsy, McCarty's work is often associated with the Art-Toy, Lowbrow, and Pop Surrealist movements.|$|E
25|$|The {{winter season}} in Paris profited {{from all this}} {{to add a little}} spice to its pleasures. While the {{newspapers}} sounded the alarm to alert people to the danger, and while appeals were made to the public authorities to do something about it, song-writers, satirists and other men <b>of</b> <b>wit</b> and spirit, provoked great pleasure among the leisured classes by playing with the word 'cube', discovering that it was a very suitable means of inducing laughter which, as we all know, is the principle characteristic that distinguishes man from the animals.|$|E
25|$|Authors {{moved in}} two {{directions}} in reaction to Charles's return. On the one hand, there was an attempt at recovering the English literature of the Jacobean period, as {{if there had been}} no disruption; but, on the other, there was a powerful sense of novelty, and authors approached Gallic models of literature and elevated the literature <b>of</b> <b>wit</b> (particularly satire and parody). The novelty would show in the literature of sceptical inquiry, and the Gallicism would show in the introduction of Neoclassicism into English writing and criticism.|$|E

25|$|As {{the series}} progresses, Creek {{gradually}} changes from an asocial anorak {{to a man}} with a great deal <b>of</b> <b>wit</b> and charm. This helps to fuel the romantic thread between him and Maddy. Jonathan's trademark duffle coat worn in the first series was actually Alan Davies' own coat that he wore to the auditions; it helped him win the role, as the writer and producers thought it suited the character. After the first series, Jonathan's coat was supplied by the wardrobe department. Davies kept the original at his home, and wore it again for the 2009 New Year's special.|$|E
25|$|Man Talk, Woman Talk is humorous, as quintessential comedies {{from the}} author can be. He makes use of wry humour to seek a level playing ground for {{resolution}} of the biases men and women nurse about one another and which affect mutual co-existence of the two. The scene is a court though devoid of the usual technicalities of court rooms. Instead of legal jargon, there is humour, arguments and counter arguments. What the author arrives at is not to prove which gender is superior but to show the complementary roles of men and women. There {{is a great deal}} <b>of</b> <b>wit</b> in the work and the setting here is the university environment where the youthful contenders are idealistic.|$|E
25|$|Chitrakatha Guchchamu is a {{collection}} of eight stories that are full <b>of</b> <b>wit</b> and morality. Chilakamarti recorded common stories related to humour, morals, real life incidents etc popular among Telugu people into two volumes under the title Vinodamulu (which literally means humour). In the second part, he included some poems too. Navvula Gani (which literally means laughing mine) is yet another humorous creation of Chilakamarti that comes in two parts. It mainly consisted of fun tit bits in various forms and it became very popular in those days. He introduced a feature called Hasya Latalu (creepers of humour) in the magazines run by him which was well received and enjoyed by large numbers of readers. Quite possibly, those Hasya Latalu were like the current day tit bits, cartoons and jokes published in the popular weeklies and dailies.|$|E
