40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the association between}} the remediation of previously disclosed material weaknesses and future accounting-related litigation. The link between remediating a material weakness {{and the likelihood of}} future accounting litigation remains an unanswered empirical question due to the competing elements of disclosing a material weakness that is positively correlated with future accounting-related lawsuits and the remediating of that previously-disclosed material weakness which {{can be viewed as a}} positive for internal control strength. The results show that the most important factor in affecting the likelihood of future litigation is the type of account underlying the material weakness as opposed to just the remediation of previously disclosed material weaknesses. The author finds a negative association between remediation of core <b>operating</b> <b>account</b> material weaknesses and the likelihood of future accounting-related litigation. This study provides evidence that firms that do remediate its most important material weaknesses lessen the likelihood of the negative monetary and market value effects of being involved in accounting litigation in the future.
