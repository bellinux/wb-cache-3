Animal Feed Science and Technology, 147, (1 - 3), 247 - 264, IMPF: 01. 88 This review presents recent {{knowledge on}} {{the inclusion of}} by-products from olive trees and olive oil extraction in the diets offered to goats and sheep. <b>Olive</b> <b>by-products</b> are evaluated {{with respect to their}} composition, digestion, degradation, ruminal fermentation, and their impact on animal performance and on product quality, with particular attention to their fatty acid profile. Olive leaves are fibrous with a low digestibility, especially of crude protein (CP), and they promote very poor rumen fermentation. However, if adequately supplemented, they may be successfully used in animal diets. The nutritive value of olive leaves is greater when fed fresh, although dry leaves may be incorporated in the diet. When olive leaves are rich in oil, ruminal protozoa decrease, and this could increase the efficiency of microbial protein synthesis in the rumen. It has also been observed that for lactating animals olive leaves result in an improvement in milk fat quality compared to diets based on conventional forages. However, {{more research is needed to}} assess the potential toxic effect of the high levels of copper in olive leaves. The use of olive cakes in ruminant diets promotes different responses in rumen fermentation, depending on the method of administration and the proportion in the diet. Both feeding as silage or incorporation into feed blocks have proved to be satisfactory. Extracted olive cake provides cheap energy and fibre to the animal and high-fat olive cake may be used to improve the quality of the fat in the animal products. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{production system}} of Iberian pig is characterized {{for having a}} finishing period called montanera, {{which is based on}} acorn intake. This kind of handling has an influence on both product quality and animal welfare issues. Acorn based diet during montanera has a positive effect on meat quality since increases the oleic content. However, montanera has an uneven effect on animal welfare, on one hand it is a semi-extensive system which is positive but, on the other hand, a restricted diet is required during pre-montanera period to prevent a non-desirable fatness percentage in final pig products. This restriction diet implies feeding stress. The use of <b>olive</b> <b>by-products</b> during the growing phase diet of Iberian pigs could be the solution to avoid this stress. Here, we studied the effect of three different dietary regimens given to Iberian pigs in growing period (42 kg to 95 kg) on backfat fatty acid composition. A control standard diet group (CD) was compared with two diets based on <b>olive</b> <b>by-products,</b> one incorporating dry olive pulp in the feed (DD), and the other one incorporating olive cake in wet form (WD).

A significantly higher oleic acid values was observed for DD and WD diets compared with CD diet.

The olive oil industry produces two main wastes: aqueous waste (olive mill wastewater) and solid waste (pomace or olive cake). These by-products are rich in phenols, which are antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds able to inhibit or delay the growth of several bacteria in vitro. The dietary effect of both olive mill wastewater polyphenolic extract (OMWPE) and dehydrated olive cake (DOC) on the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in broiler chickens was investigated. A commercial basal diet was supplemented with either OMWPE- or DOC-enriched maize at two dosages (low: 16 %; high: 33 %).

40|$|After oil {{extraction}} from olives, {{large amounts of}} by-products are generated every year. If subjected to advanced biotechnologies of composting they can be re-used in agriculture as eco-compatible amenders, fertilizers and/or natural pesticide. In this regard, olive oil by-products composted in a pilot scale olive plant were characterized and assayed for suppressive activity against fungal plant pathogens. Some cured composts consistently reduced the growth in vitro of Verticillium dahliae and other important fungal pathogens. The efficacy of composts decreased or disappeared when the composts were autoclaved before using. The inhibitory activity seems due to the beneficial residual microbial population selected during the composting process. In experiments performed on young olive plants grown on soil artificially contaminated by V. dahliae microsclerotia (MC), the incorporation of 15 % (w/w) of a selected cured compost or the antagonistic fungus Trichoderma viridae as well as 15 % (w/w) of cured compost and T. viridae applied together significantly reduced the density of V. dahliae MC in the soil. The results of this investigation indicate that composted <b>olive</b> <b>by-products</b> are very promising to control fungal pathogens of olive and other crops in organic and integrated agriculture systems.

40|$|The {{estimated}} growing {{of world}} population {{coupled with the}} increase of food demand, especially of animal products, will lead to an increase in agro-industrial food waste. The food-processing industries generate several by-products and wastes that still contain valuable amounts of nutrients. In particular, in the Mediterranean area the production of olive oil is associated with high amounts of waste and by-products, liquid (wastewater) and solid (olive pomace), rich in nutrients such as fatty acids, pectins and bioactive molecules as polyphenols. The present thesis focused on the use of different olive oil by-products in dairy ewes feeding as a sustainable way to improve milk fatty acid composition without affecting the overall feeding efficiency of the animals. In the first trial, an olive crude phenolic concentrate (OCPC), obtained by specific treatments of olive wastewater, was added to the diet of dairy ewes. In the second trial, two different kind of stoned olive pomaces (PSO 2 from two-phase oil extraction and PSO 3 from three-phase oil extraction) containing high amounts of polyphenols were adopted as feed ingredient. In order to amplify the effect of olive polyphenols on rumen biohydrogenation (BH) process of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), the diets adopted in both trials were supplemented with extruded linseed. In both trials, dietary treatments did not affect milk yield and gross composition (fat, protein, lactose and urea content). Regarding the milk fatty acid profile, in both trials, the amount of α-linolenic acid (C 18 : 3 n 3) significantly increased in milk fat, especially at the highest dose of OCPC (first trial) and when ewes fed PSO 2 die (second trial). In the second trial, the content of oleic acid in milk fat was significantly higher in milk samples of ewes supplemented with olive pomace, irrespective of the kind of olive pomace considered. Stearic acid content in milk fat, did not significantly vary in both trials, although in rumen liquor the content of stearic acid was lower from ewes supplemented with higher dose of OCPC or with PSO. In the first trial, OCPC linearly decreased the BH of C 18 : 3 n 3. However, a significant accumulation of C 18 : 3 n 3 in the rumen liquor was obtained only at the higher dose of OCPC in the concentrate (nearly 1. 2 mg/ 100 g DM). Data about overall composition of rumen microbioma supported that the highest dose of OCPC could be effective in perturbing microbes. In the second trial, PSO 2 diet resulted more effective than PSO 3 in the perturbation of rumen BH of C 18 : 3 n 3. In rumen liquor, the pattern of correlation between the composition of dimethyl-acetals (DMA) and the presence of olive polyphenols in the diet was also investigated. DMA derive from fatty aldehydes released from plasmalogen lipids (a subclass of phospholipids), contained in the membranes of ruminal bacteria. The presence of olive polyphenols in the diet of dairy ewes did not lead to changes in total DMA content of rumen liquor. However, in both experiments, {{a significant difference in the}} relative proportion of individual DMA (i. e. DMA 16 : 0) was observed, by comparing diet containing olive polyphenols and control diets. According to the discriminant analysis applied to data about DMA composition of rumen liquor, the canonical variables obtained allowed to correctly separate samples of different diets in both trials, suggesting that a few DMA have discriminant power in order to identify specific rumen environment related to feeding conditions. In conclusion, the use of <b>olive</b> <b>by-products</b> in the diet of dairy ewes did not have any negative effects on milk yield and gross composition and on animal health. Moreover, at the highest dose, the olive polyphenols were able to reduce the rumen biohydrogenation of PUFA, resulting in a higher content of PUFA in milk fat. Moreover, since <b>olive</b> <b>by-products</b> are considered waste with high polluting power, their use in dairy ewe feeding may have beneficial environmental effects. At the same time, olive pomace may replace part of the daily ration, reducing the use of soil and water to produce other ingredients for the concentrate feed, and consequently reducing feeding costs...|$|E

This semi-extensive system {{is based on}} ad libitum intake of grass and acorn, which has {{a positive effect on}} meat quality and favors animal wellbeing. However, the restricted diet supplied during the growing period to prevent a nondesirable fatness percentage in final pig products could cause feeding stress. The use of <b>olive</b> <b>by-products</b> during the growing phase diet of Iberian pigs could be the solution to avoid this stress, but it might have an influence on meat quality. Here, we studied the effect of three different dietary regimens given to Iberian pigs during the growing period (42 kg to 95 kg) on several meat quality traits. A control standard diet group (CD) was compared with two diets based on olive byproducts, one incorporating dry olive pulp in the feed (DD) and the other one incorporating olive cake in wet form (WD). The last one consisted of olive cake in a silage presentation offered ad libitum and supplemented with a specific feed given once a day in a restricted regimen as the CD and DD diets. We performed meat quality analysis on several traits related with water-holding capacity (thaw loss, (TL); cook loss, (CL); and centrifuge force loss, (CFL)), tenderness (Warner-Bratzler shear force (Sf)), marbling (Vet) and color (CIELab coordinates for luminosity (L), redness (a), and yellowness (b); color indexes Hue (H) and Chroma (C); and myoglobin concentration, (Mb)). ANOVA was made in order to compare growing diets. We found significant differences in several measured traits. CFL was higher in CD than in WD, meaning that meat from pigs fed with standard diet may have lower water-holding capacity than with olive-based diets. According to color, DD samples were paler and less red-colored than CD and WD ones, and myoglobin concentration was also lower in DD. No differences were observed in visual marbling measures, nor in shear force.

We tested the in vivo effects of alperujo, an <b>olive</b> production <b>by-product,</b> as well as hydroxytyrosol and 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) isolated from alperujo, on indices and pathways of oxidative and metabolic stress in a vitamin E-deficient rat model. Methods and results: Rats were fed a vitamin E-deficient diet for 10 weeks, followed by this diet supplemented with either 100 mg/kg diet dα-tocopherol, alperujo extract, hydroxytyrosol, or 10 mg/kg diet DHPG, for a further 2 weeks. We detected alperujo phenolics in tissues and blood, indicating they are bioavailable. Alperujo extract partially ameliorated elevated plasma levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and also lowered plasma cholesterol levels, whereas hydroxytyrosol increased plasma triglyceride levels. Proteomics and subsequent network analysis revealed that hepatic mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH 2), of which protein and activity levels were regulated by dα-tocopherol and olive phenolics, represents a novel central regulatory protein hub affected by the dietary interventions. Conclusion: The in vivo free radical scavenging properties of olive phenolics appear relatively modest in our model.

In the course of this study, two compounds were isolated from the ethanolic extracts of olive wood collected during the olives’ harvesting season and identified as (7 ′′R) - 7 ′′-ethoxyoleuropein (1) and (7 ′′S) - 7 ′′-ethoxyoleuropein (2) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{antifungal}} {{activity of}} phenolic compounds extracted from olive pomace against Alternaria solani, Botrytis cinerea and Fusarium culmorum was investigated. <b>Olive</b> pomace, a <b>by-product</b> of <b>olive</b> oil production, {{was used as}} a source of phenolic compounds. The extracted phenolics were added to a medium to reach phenol concentration of 0, 1 and 0, 2 %(w/v) and tested for their antifungal activity against the three fungi. In addition, the fungi were cultivated in a medium containing a commercial fungicide in the concentration of 0, 2 % (w/v). Both of the phenolic concentrations inhibited the growth of all three fungi with the higher being more effective. It resulted in a four-fold reduction of the mycelial growth rate of A. solani and F. culmorum. The present study demonstrated that the phenolic compounds derived from olive pomace hold a good promise as a natural fungicide against common pathogens to crops...|$|R
40|$|Background Over the years, food {{industry}} wastes {{have been the}} focus of a growing interest due to their content in high added-value compounds. A good example are the <b>olive</b> oil <b>by-products</b> (OOBP), which retain a great amount of phenolic compounds during olive oil production. Their structure and biological properties justify their potential use as antioxidants in other food products. The efficient recovery of phenolic compounds has been extensively studied and optimized in order to maximize their reintroduction in the food chain and contribute to a higher valorization and better management of wastes from olive oil industry. Scope and approach This paper reviews the most representative phenolic compounds described in OOBP and their biological properties. New extraction procedures to efficiently recover these compounds and the most advanced chromatographic techniques that have been used for {{a better understanding of the}} phenolic profile of these complex matrices are also referred. Finally, this paper reports the main applications of OOBP, with emphasis on their phenolic content as natural antioxidants for food applications. Key findings and conclusions Besides their antioxidant activity, phenolic compounds from OOBP have also shown antimicrobial and antitumoral properties. Their application as food antioxidants requires new extraction techniques, including the use of non-toxic solvents and, in a pilot scale, the use of filters and adsorbent resins. The inclusion of phenolic compounds from OOBP in some food matrices have improved not only their antioxidant capacity but also their sensory attributes...|$|R
40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} at JUST agricultural research center during 1999 - 2000 growing season to evaluate the effects of soil amendment with <b>olive</b> mill <b>by-products</b> (Jift) on growth of faba bean and their symbiosis with VA fungi. Soil was amended with Jift at different levels (Jift: Soil; 0 : 10, 1 : 9, 2 : 8, 3 : 7 and 4 : 6) and exposed to solarization, methyl bromide and fungicide treatments. A split plot design with three replications was used, in which soil treatments (solarization, methyl bromide, fungicide and untreated control) were assigned to main plots and soil-Jift mixtures to sub plots. Our data indicated that the maximum seed yield (2943 kg ha 1) was achieved under soil mixtures treated with fungicide, followed by those which treated with methyl bromide (2662 kg ha 1) and untreated control (2343 kg ha 1). When Jift was considered as main factor, seed yield {{was found to be}} increased as Jift level was increased in soil mixtures. Even so, seed yield (2861 kg ha 1) at the highest Jift level (3 : 7) was not considerably different from the yield at the rate of 2 : 8 (2998 kg ha 1). Phosphorus nutrition may be enhanced with Jift amendment remarkably for soils branded by low organic matter contents. Mycorrhizal fungi population and symbiosis with the legume crops could be increased when Jift was added to the soil, particularly under soil sterilization practices...|$|R
40|$|Two organic {{amendments}} (OMW-M 1 and 11 OMW-M 2), {{based on}} olive mill wastes (OMWs) subjected to advanced processes of aerobic static storage or composting, were tested for their suppressive activity against Verticillium dahliae, the causal agent of olive Verticillium wilt. OMW-M 1 and OMW-M 2 drastically inhibited the pathogen growth in vitro {{and then were}} further tested in suppressive pot experiments. The amendments, mixed at 15 % (v/v) with a nursery standard plant-growth matrix, were tested alone or in combination with two biocontrol bacteria (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Burkholderia cepacia) selected from suppressive soils. All mixtures were artificially contaminated with V. dahliae microsclerotia (MS), the density of which was periodically monitored by either a semi-selective medium or a specific real-time PCR technique. In plant-less pot assays conducted in a growth chamber, OMW-M 1 was the most effective amendment, reducing V. dahliae MS density by 100 %after 90 days {{with respect to the}} untreated control. In nursery experiments with pot-growing olive plants, OMW-M 1, particularly when combined with the biocontrol bacteria, confirmed its strong suppressive activity reducing up to 100 % the density of V. dahliae MS in the rhizosphere behaving even better than a commercial biofungicide (Trichoderma asperellum TV 1) used as a control. The best combined treatment also reduced plant mortality and increased root and shoot extension. We conclude that organic amendments from stabilized <b>olive</b> mill <b>by-products</b> showed positive agronomic and phyto-sanitary properties on pot-growing olive plants and, particularly when enriched with biocontrol agents, they are potentially suitable for use in sustainable agriculture...|$|R
40|$|Greece {{is one of}} {{the major}} olive oil {{producing}} countries, covering 17 % of the worldwide production. In the recent years, the productive process takes place in centrifugal type olive oil mills of three phases and two phases. In the first case, three outflows are produced, the olive oil, the liquid wastewaters and oil-stone. In the second case, apart from <b>olive</b> oil, the <b>by-product</b> is a semi-solid waste called <b>olive</b> pulp. The <b>by-products</b> of the <b>olive</b> oil process provoke serious repercussions to the environment from the uncontrolled disposal to the soil and to the rivers or to the sea, because of the high organic load and the especially toxic action of certain components. For this reason many bibliographic reports exist regarding treatment methods of this waste, which include physical, chemical and biological methods, with the last to be considered more effective. The present study aims to the risk assessment of olive oil mill wastewaters (OMW) posed to aquatic ecosystems and to the estimation of the effectiveness of three biological treatment methods regarding the reduction of toxicity, driving to safe environmental disposal. Analyses of the physicochemical characteristics were conducted for the effluents that resulted from the treatment of the waste with the white rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus, as well as from the anaerobic treatment in reactors for hydrogen and methane production. The effectiveness of the aforementioned methods was validated via the ecotoxicological approach with the use of the two microbiotests Thamnotoxkit F and Daphtoxkit FTM pulex and the embryo toxicity test of the zebrafish Danio rerio. It must be noted that a similar integrated study has not been conducted not only in Greece but worldwide, a fact rendering the whole effort especially interesting. Seven (7) samples of the untreated OMW were collected from a three phase system, 16 samples from the outflow of the treatment with P. ostreatus, ΕΚΤΙΜΗΣΗ ΤΗΣ ΟΙΚΟΛΟΓΙΚΗΣ ΠΟΙΟΤΗΤΑΣ ΤΝ ΑΠΟΡΡΟΝ ΑΠΟ 2 ΙΑΦΟΡΕΤΙΚΕΣ ΜΕΘΟ 2 ΟΥΣ ΕΠΕΞΕΡΓΑΣΙΑΣ ΤΝ ΕΛΑΙΟΥΡΓΙΚΝ ΑΠΟΒΛΗΤΝ 14 50 samples from the anaerobic reactor for hydrogen production and 25 samples from the methane producing reactor.

This study is aimed at comparing the environmental profile of eco-innovation options in green chemistry using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). A case study in which synthetic ingredients are replaced by others derived from natural compounds is presented. A C 16 - 18 triglycerides mixture (INCI name “palmitic/stearic triglycerides”) derived from <b>olive</b> oil industry <b>by-products</b> is used both as single ingredient (Innovation I) and as part of a preformulated one (Innovation II), replacing the starting formulation (Benchmark) silicone and caprylic/capric triglyceride. LCA using ILCD impact assessment has been applied to the first steps of a cosmetic supply chain in Lombardy, and a cradle-to-gate analysis performed, paying particular attention to water and energy consumption, raw materials origins and their previous manufacturing stages. In order to test the results, two sensitivity analyses were performed, changing assumptions about transports and irrigation of olive trees. A further sensitivity analysis was run using two different LCIA methods (CML and IMPACT 2002) : obtained results show some significant differences, especially in eco/human toxicity impact categoriesJRC.

40|$|In the {{northern}} of Morocco, goat population {{is the most}} dominant. His diet is based on forest rangelands. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} diversify and improve its feed calendar. <b>Olive</b> cake is <b>by-product</b> of oil extraction that widely available in the region with important production. It can be a feed resource of ruminant. This resource is produced by three methods and for limited period. This work aims to determine the effect of different oil extraction method and period on the chemical composition of olive cake in northern of Morocco. Twenty-seven samples of olive cake were collected from 3 mills by each extraction method (mechanical pressure, centrifugation 2 and 3 phases) during three periods (November, December and January). The chemical composition (dry matter, fat, mineral matter, crude protein and fibers) of the collected samples was determined by AOAC methods (1997). The extraction method had a significant effect on all parameters of the chemical composition {{with the exception of the}} fat and crude protein (P< 0. 05). The olive cake obtained by centrifugation 2 phases method had lower dry matter and fibers. The period had no effect on chemical composition, which eases the introduction of olive cake in the diet of ruminants. The olive cake of 2 phases is the most suitable for feed but has a reduced shelf life, which requires the development of a suitable conservation mode. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Global waste {{production}} has raised recently due to numerous agricultural and industrial activities. Among other actions devoted to waste reduction, revaluation {{seems to be}} the most advantageous one from an environmental and economic point of view. In the <b>olive</b> oil sector, <b>by-product</b> management (namely <b>olive</b> pomace, olive mill wastewater, and sludge residue) poses serious problems for companies, with the energy use of these wastes being a feasible option to solve these problems. Due to their high moisture content, drying constitutes the main stage for a possible bio-fuel conversion. This research work deals with the analysis of drying for the three main wastes from olive oil by using a prototype dryer. This equipment has different working regimes depending on the kind of convection (natural or forced for passive and active mode, respectively), the incidence of solar radiation on the product (indirect or mixed type) and the use of an additional system for energy supply (hybrid type). From the results, it could be said that all the wastes were suitable for solar drying. However, drying conditions were different for each case. Olive pomace and olive mill wastewater showed promising results for solar drying application in mixed active mode. Concerning sludge residue, its special physical structure could employ the use of turners for drying, in order to improve heat transfer to the product. Moreover, hybrid active mode enabled a considerable reduction in drying time, being an aspect to take into account for its use during low solar radiation or at night time...|$|R
40|$|The olive fruit, its oil, and {{the leaves}} of the olive tree have a rich history of nutritional, medicinal, and {{ceremonial}} uses. A large number of scientific studies have suggested that these beneficial properties are related to the high level of antioxidants, particularly phenolic compounds, in this plant species. This explains the increasing interest focused on these compounds. The present doctoral thesis deals with the analysis of phenolic compounds in the main product and <b>by-product</b> of Tunisian <b>olive,</b> namely olive oil and olive leaves. The results are presented as two main sections according to the matrix used. The SECTION I is basically dedicated to the olive oil and is divided into three chapters: The chapter 1 includes a review on the polyphenols occurring in Tunisian olive products (olive fruit and olive oil) and some <b>by-products</b> (<b>olive</b> leaves and olive-mill wastewater). The various methods used for the analysis as well as the bioactive properties of these compounds reported in recent years are described. The chapter 2 concerns the characterisation of extra-virgin olive oils from the two main Tunisian varieties and another four varieties grown in restricted geographical zones. The aim is to explore their phenolic profile and improve the potential of the secondary varieties under study. The phenolic compounds, determined using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-TOF-MS), showed significant variation among the six varieties. The parameters studied were analysed chemometrically to discriminate among the cultivars. In this sense, the principal-component analysis (PCA) showed that variables such as oleic, linoleic, quinic and vanillic acids, apigenin, luteolin, taxifolin, oleuropein aglycon, pinoresinol acetate, elenolic acid, and oxidative stability discriminate the different varieties of extra-virgin olive oil studied. The agglomerative hierarchical clustering results agreed with those found by PCA. Moreover, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) enabled the classification of the oil samples according to their geographical origin. In the chapter 3, the behaviour of the phenolic profile of extra-virgin olive oils from 13 accessions belonging to the variety "Chemlali" was studied according to the production zone. The phenolic-profile data gained using HPLC "ESI-TOF"MS were used for oil classification by geographical area. The production area has significantly influenced the phenolic composition of the 'Chemlali' olive-oil variety, oils produced from 'Oueslatia', 'Ain Zena', 'Siliana' and 'Bir Ali Ben Khelifa', among others, being the richest in polyphenols. A discriminant analysis model gave a correct classification pathway with 100...|$|R
