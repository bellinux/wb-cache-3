40|$|A {{numerical}} model based on reaction the rmodynamics {{has been developed}} to simulate basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>steel</b> making process for predicting hot metal composition inside Linz-Donawitz (LD) converter with respect to blowing time. This mode l also contributes to-wards the prediction of sloping phenomenon taken place during basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>steel</b> mak-ing process. Modelling of basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>steel</b> making process has significant utility as productivity and lining life of Basic Oxygen Steelmaking(BOS) is highly dependable upon mass, momentum, energy transfer and rigorous interaction among metal,slag and gaseous phases. Comprehensive thermodynamic model of basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>steel</b> making pro-cess has been developed to predict the bath composition and temperature as well as de-carburization rate dynamically based on relevant blowing process parameters. One of the striking features of this developed model {{is the first time}} prediction of temperature vari-ation depending on evolving bath composition and generated heat from bath composition dependent feasible reactions and their extent. Moreover, this {{numerical model}} does not require off gas analysis to maintain its dynamic nature of prediction. A true attempt for the benefit of steel industry is made for predicting slopping initiation time for particular blowing condition based on correlation with model predicted decarburization rate and critical decarburization rate for bloating of metal droplet. In connection to that, formation of foamy slag and sloping possibility have been studied using thermodynamic modelling followed by multiphase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation technique. The CFD simulation has been carried out taking different turbulence models along with vol-ume of fluid method (VOF) using ANSYS 15. 0 software.

In this paper, the relevance of various determinants for the diffusion of electric arc furnance steel (structural change) and for the energy-use of new technologies in the German steel industry sector is assessed econometrically. The empirical findings support the hypotheses that the diffusion of electric arc furnane steel is accelerated by enery and material input prices and dampened by path dependencies. The findings further suggest that the energy performance of new technologies is affected by energy and material input prices, by expenditures for research and development, and - for basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>steel</b> - also by industry concentration...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{legacies}} {{of the coal}} mining industry is the existence of numerous colliery spoil mounds. Run-off waters from some of these mounds result in oxidation of sulphur compounds causing pH to drop to perhaps as low as 2. 5. At this pH, mobility for metals increases and it results in destruction of both flora and fauna. In order to reduce acidity, a number of solutions have been investigated with varying degree of success. A recent study to reduce acidity in spoil run-off water included the use of Basic <b>Oxygen</b> <b>Steel</b> slag. Its slow release of lime resulted in longer term remediation compared with other techniques. In addition to this, steel slag contains elements which are essential for plant growth and {{can be regarded as}} a weak fertiliser. This was substantiated in two field trials, which had the aim of not only remediating acidity from two different types of colliery spoils, but also to develop a composition that supports grass growth. The objectives were achieved at both sites and some of the results of over 5000 chemical tests conducted during these studies are reported in this paper...|$|E

This study uses basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>steel</b> slag (BOS) from a U. K. feedstock. Batch experiments demonstrated the effective removal of phosphorus with varying initial pH, initial P concentration, clast size, and ionic strength to represent environmental conditions. Continuous flow column experiments, operated for 406 days, with an influent P concentration of 1 − 50 mg/L (typical of domestic and dairy parlour waste) achieved removal of up to 62 %; a second set of column experiments running for 306 days with an influent P concentration of 100 − 300 mg/L achieved a maximum effective removal of 8. 39 mg/g. This figure is higher than that for other slags reviewed in this study (e. g., EAF Slag 3. 93 mg/g and NZ melter slag 1. 23 mg/g). XRD, E-SEM, and EDX data provide evidence for a sequential series of increasingly less soluble P mineral phases forming on the BOS surface (octa-calcium phosphate, brushite, and hydroxylapatite), which suggests that BOS may be a suitable substrate in passive treatment systems, providing a long-term P removal mechanism...|$|E

40|$|Analyses and/or {{scenarios}} of future industrial production, {{especially in the}} field of energy-intensive industries, can be useful for a variety of different task e. g. policy advice, energy demand modelling, resource availability/sustainability, and other. Especially future projection of the physical production differentiated on process level including the modelling of structural change and material strategies are of major importance to generate comprehensive and transparent scenario projections/results. In this context, another challenge is the modelling of this physical production in a hybrid model system, which means to link economic and demographic information provided by a macroeconomic model to the projection of physical production units, e. g. tonnes of an industrial branch. In this paper a short analysis of the historic steel production for selected European countries has been made, selected literature on material efficiency and recycling potentials is reported, and a methodology for the hybrid modelling of future steel use and production on process level as well as scrap availability is described. The paper shows that steel is an old energy-intensive product, facing a decreasing GDP intensity, with a trend to secondary production. This trend to secondary production makes the domestic scrap availability, but also trade in scrap and scrap quality an important factor which has to be considered when modelling future steel production. The developed methodology describes a comprehensive approach to translate macroeconomic sector information, e. g. economic value of an industry (gross value added), into apparent steel use/true steel use of a country and calculate its physical production of crude steel, electric steel, and <b>oxygen</b> <b>steel</b> considering structural change, prompt scrap availability, and end-of-life scrap availability on European level.

40|$|M. Ing. Steel {{products}} {{can be produced}} by either following the blast furnace with <b>oxygen</b> <b>steel</b> making route or the electric arc steel making route. The blast furnace with oxygen route requires liquid iron to produce steel and the electric arc route requires scrap metal as a major input. This in essence implies that for the blast furnace route if no liquid iron is produced, no steel products will be produced and similarly so for the electric arc route. ArcelorMittal Vanderbijlpark Works produces its liquid iron from two furnaces namely blast furnace C and blast furnace D. However the reliability of these furnaces is in question as their daily operations are plagued with random failures of equipment and machinery. The main consequence of these failures is the unavailability of the furnaces to produce liquid iron. This is undesirable from a business perspective due to the inherent production losses, loss of potential earnings {{as well as the}} high costs incurred to restore the furnaces back into operation. This research dissertation will focus on the operation of these blast furnaces. The fundamental success criteria for this research document will be to identify opportunities to improve the reliable operation of these furnaces. The scope of the work will however be limited to blast furnace C and particularly at improving its charging system’s availability. The availability of the charging system can be improved by knowing what type of failures to expect and how to mitigate their effects. A starting point would then be to examine past failure data. Thus data from 2008 has been collected and analyzed making use of statistical methods, design analysis methods and research methodologies. The results suggest that the availability of the system has a direct correlation between its reliability and maintainability. The results obtained were then subjected to a risk analysis to identify measures that could be employed to improve the charging system’s availability...|$|E
