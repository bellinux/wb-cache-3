25|$|Some {{writers such}} as Stanley Karnow {{question}} whether there was an immediate American perception of Tet as a defeat however, given the drop in {{public support for the}} war prior to Tet, and polls taken during the initial Tet fighting showing a majority of the US public wanted stronger action against Communist forces.

25|$|One of {{the most}} crucial {{developments}} of trans-hemispheric relations for Canada during Mulroney’s time in office came in Canada’s official enrollment in the OAS in 1990. Until this point Canada’s position on the institution was that it existed as a tool <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>political</b> and economic preponderance in Latin America. However, with the erosion of Cold War tensions, waning American hegemonic interests in the region, {{and the proliferation of}} democracy throughout Latin America Canada saw the increasing importance of the OAS as a unifying institution.|$|E
25|$|Set in two spaces, one {{of which}} {{represents}} the personal life of Marilyn Monroe (1926-1962) and the other which depicts moments <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>political</b> and civic life, the story interweaves the myth and decline of the movie star up to her mysterious death, with accounts of significant past events: the Korean war, the McCarthy era investigations, the prosecution of Wilhelm Reich, and the lectures of Timothy Leary {{on the use of}} psychedelic drugs. Marilyn is seen as an involuntary victim of the mass culture of her time, a figure only superficially serene and optimistic, a heroine in spite of herself, whose contradictory personality is represented in twelve scenes, equally distributed in the two acts.|$|E
25|$|Manifest Destiny was {{the idea}} that it was God’s will for the United States to expand because it is Protestant, democratic, and white. It {{promoted}} the notion of American racial superiority, casting all nonwhites, including Native Americans, Mexicans, and blacks, as inferior beings. John L. O'Sullivan coined the phrase in 1845, first using it in his newspaper, the United States Democratic Review. Manifest destiny soon became an important element <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>political</b> rhetoric. It called for the expansion of the United States and was a justification used by southerners for extending slavery. An example of this was the annexation of Texas. President James K. Polk used the argument of manifest destiny to support his intentions of claiming Texas. In 1845, Texas entered the United States as the fifteenth slave state. Since whites were seen as superior beings, slavery didn’t seem like such a brutal practice. The whites were not the ones suffering, and that is all that mattered.|$|E

25|$|The 18th century saw the {{introduction}} of Francis Bacon and the Enlightenment philosophers Descartes, Newton, Locke, Wollaston, and Berkeley to Colonial British America. Two native-born Americans, Samuel Johnson and Jonathan Edwards, were first influenced by these philosophers; they then adapted and extended their Enlightenment ideas {{to develop their own}} American theology and philosophy. Both were originally ordained Puritan Congregationalist ministers who embraced much of the new learning of the Enlightenment. Both were Yale educated and Berkeley influenced idealists who became influential college presidents. Both were influential in the development <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>political</b> philosophy and the works of the Founding Fathers. But Edwards based his reformed Puritan theology on Calvinist doctrine, while Johnson converted to the Anglican episcopal religion (the Church of England), then based his new American moral philosophy on William Wollaston's Natural Religion. Late in the century, Scottish Innate or Common Sense Realism replaced the native schools of these two rivals in the college philosophy curricula of American colleges; it would remain the dominant philosophy in American academia up to the Civil War.|$|E
25|$|Ruiz de Burton uses {{irony and}} satire to mock American {{political}} discourses and practices by ridiculing socio-political {{structures of the}} period. Using a variety of rogues, who have pretentious and comical names, Ruiz de Burton represents the vices of nineteenth-century middle-class society. The preachers, Mr. Hackwell and Mr. Hammerhard, the neighbors, the Cackles, and other political figures in Who Would Have Thought It? are unmasked to break down ideological myths <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>political</b> rhetoric by contrasting {{the expectations of the}} nation with the reality of their actions. American expectations include promoting civil virtue and acting against corruption. However, Mr. Hackwell, the primary religious figure in the novel, schemes to increase his wealth in order to satisfy his ravenous greed. The Cackles clan represents Northern politicians who are only motivated by self-interest. Ruiz de Burton implies that the national practice of self-deception, misrepresentation and secrecy are deeply rooted in the American character, though very rarely revealed. Juxtaposed to this satire of American life are the virtues of the good and beautiful Lola.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Dworkin {{published}} her autobiography, Heartbreak: The Political Memoir of a Feminist Militant.

[...] She published three more articles in the Guardian and began work on a new book, Writing America: How Novelists Invented and Gendered a Nation, on the role of novelists such as Ernest Hemingway and William Faulkner in the development <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>political</b> and cultural identity, which was left unfinished when she died.|$|E
500|$|Many {{observers}} were more circumspect. As early as October 1969 (and possibly anticipating {{the loss of}} their Cambodian routes) PAVN had begun what was [...] "probably their largest and most intense logistical effort of the whole war" [...] by constructing and expanding their routes into northwestern Cambodia. The CIA estimated that the replacement of the supplies lost during the incursion would only take 75 days to achieve. As far as the long-term repercussions, there were three, all detrimental to the American cause: the loss <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>political</b> support by the Nixon administration, which would eventually lead to the fall of South Vietnam in 1975; the beginning of outright support of the Khmer Rouge by the North Vietnamese (who despised and distrusted their Chinese-supported comrades); and the spreading of general war throughout Southeast Asia.|$|E
