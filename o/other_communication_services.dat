40|$|International audienceIn {{this chapter}} {{different}} {{factors that may}} influence Quality of Experience (QoE) {{in the context of}} media consumption, networked <b>services,</b> and <b>other</b> electronic <b>communication</b> <b>services</b> and applications, are discussed. QoE can be subject to a range of complex and strongly interrelated factors, falling into three categories: human, system and context influence factors (IFs). With respect to Human IFs, we discuss variant and stable factors that may potentially bear an influence on QoE, either for low-level (bottom-up) or higher-level (top-down) cognitive processing. System IFs are classified into four distinct categories, namely content-, media-, network- and device-related IFs. Finally, the broad category of possible Context IFs is decomposed into factors linked to the physical, temporal, social, economic, task and technical information context. The overview given here illustrates the complexity of QoE and the broad range of aspects that potentially have a major influence on it...|$|R

A local exchange carrier normally sells package deals that include local and local toll calls. Local calls are customarily billed in by the call, or in blocks of calls.

40|$|The Internet is {{the main}} cause of the recent {{explosion}} of activity in optical fiber telecommunications.

Much {{like the idea of}} a book necessitated the development of the library or the idea of structured curriculum and domains of knowledge produced classrooms, the idea of the Internet – distributed, social, networked – influences the structure of education, teaching, and learning. Educators and researchers face a challenge in determining how the existing education system will be influenced and the new roles that will be expected of learners, teachers, and administrators. Information-centric fields such as journalism have struggled with the new democracy of information creation for over a decade.

40|$|Internet {{traffic is}} {{approximately}} doubling each year. This growth rate applies {{not only to}} the entire Internet, but to a large range of individual institutions. For a few places we have records going back several years that exhibit this regular rate of growth. Even when there are no obvious bottlenecks, traffic tends not to grow much faster. This reflects complicated interactions of technology, economics, and sociology, similar to those that have produced &quot;Moore's Law &quot; in semiconductors. A doubling of traffic each year represents extremely fast growth, much faster than the increases in <b>other</b> <b>communication</b> <b>services.</b> If it continues, data traffic will surpass voice traffic around the year 2002. However, this rate of growth is slower than the frequently heard claims of a doubling of traffic every three or four months. Such spectacular growth rates apparently did prevail over a two-year period 1995 - 6. Ever since, though, growth appears to have reverted to the Internet's historical pattern of a single doubling each year. Progress in transmission technology appears sufficient to double network capacity each year for about the next decade. However, traffic growth faster than a tripling each year could probably not be sustained {{for more than a few}} years. Since computing and storage capacities will also be growing, a...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Multidrug {{resistant}} organisms (MDRO), including Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), {{and health}} care associated infections (HCAIs) are pressing issues for health care systems across the world. Information and communication are considered key tools for the prevention and management of infectious diseases. Public Health Authorities (PHA) are {{in a unique position}} to communicate with health care professionals, patients and the public regarding the health risks. Study design: We used PHA helpdesk interaction data to first ascertain the information requirements of those getting in contact with the service, and secondly to examine the communicative behaviour of the PHA, with a view to improving the quality of communication strategies. Methods: Data on helpdesk interactions between 2010 and 2012 were obtained from a MDRO network of nine German PHAs. 501 recordings were coded and descriptive statistics generated for further qualitative thematic analysis. Results: Our analysis revealed a similar pattern of questions among different groups. Key areas of need for information were around eradication, cleaning and isolation measures. Reported problems were a lack of expert knowledge and continuity of treatment. The helpdesk response was mainly a conversation offering scientific advice, but also included <b>other</b> <b>communication</b> <b>services</b> that went beyond the provision of scientific facts, such as follow-up calls, referral suggestions and consultations on behalf of the caller. These social communication activities seem to have an important impact on the acceptability of public health recommendations and use of the helpdesk...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis discusses the utility {{and application of}} high speed networks in the evolving technological environment of communications. In the early sections of this work the primary thesis explicitly presents the properties of fiber optics, existing and developing high speed networks, and applications of these high speed networks. The analysis and validation of this thesis leads to two major postulations. The first investigates the possibility of replacing the current communication network for the Aegis real-time combat system aboard Naval ships with a dual optical fiber ring. This network would consolidate all sensors, weapons, electronic equipment, and computers into a single communication network, possessing a simple topology, higher data transfer capability, and enhanced security. The network has also been designed to accommodate the projected requirements {{of the next generation}} of surface combatant. The future system is expected to build upon the current Aegis combat system architecture, becoming more complex but remaining a well integrated and easily operable combat system. A high speed network based on FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Network) can satisfy the demand for more bandwidth, integrating both real-time and <b>other</b> <b>communication</b> <b>services</b> aboard a ship. This paper supports the view that FDDI can not only successfully replace the current communications in a ship's combat system, but also provide an enhanced level of operation. There are also several other advantages which are quite significant. These include a significant reduction in weight and volume, and reduced susceptibility to electromagnetic interference. The second major construction is the configuration of a hospital health care system utilizing a high speed network. The intern-hospital network would connect the medical hardware, electronic equipment, and computers into a single network. It is projected that the intern-hospital network will interface with an external network employing emerging telephone transmission capabilities. The high speed networks based on Distributed Queue Dual Bus (DQDB) and Synchronous Optic NETwork (SONET) / Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) can satisfy the demand for more bandwidth, integrating services such as voice, video, image, and text.
