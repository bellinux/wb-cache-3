5|$|After a brief {{visit to}} the Advaita Ashrama in Mayavati Vivekananda settled at Belur Math, where he {{continued}} co-ordinating the works of Ramakrishna Mission, the math and the work in England and the US. He had many visitors, including royalty and politicians. Although Vivekananda was unable to attend the Congress <b>of</b> <b>Religions</b> in 1901 in Japan due to deteriorating health, he made pilgrimages to Bodhgaya and Varanasi. Declining health (including asthma, diabetes and chronic insomnia) restricted his activity.|$|E
5|$|Animal Sacrifice of {{a buffalo}} or goat, {{particularly}} during smallpox epidemics, has been practiced {{in parts of}} South India. The sacrificed animal is dedicated to a goddess, and is probably related to the myth of goddess Kali in Andhra Pradesh, but in Karnataka, the typical goddess is Renuka. According to Alf Hiltebeitel – a professor <b>of</b> <b>Religions,</b> History and Human Sciences, these ritual animal sacrifices, with some differences, mirrors goddess-related ritual animal sacrifice found in Gilgamesh epic and in texts of Egyptian, Minoan and Greek sources.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{theology}} {{is a movement}} that reconsiders the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies <b>of</b> <b>religions</b> from a feminist perspective.

5|$|A {{number of}} special worship events {{have been held}} since the renovation. They have taken {{advantage}} of the cover, temperature control, and enhanced security. However, in addition to the more recent programs, one early event occurred in September 1983, even before the modern renovation. At that time U.S. Sixth Fleet Chaplain Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff was allowed to hold an unusual interfaith service—the first interfaith service ever conducted at the Wall during the time it was under Israeli control—that included men and women sitting together. The ten-minute service included the Priestly Blessing, recited by Resnicoff, who is a Kohen. A Ministry <b>of</b> <b>Religions</b> representative was present, responding to press queries that the service was authorized as part of a special welcome for the U.S. Sixth Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Despite declining health, Vivekananda {{left for}} the West {{for a second time}} in June 1899 {{accompanied}} by Sister Nivedita and Swami Turiyananda. Following a brief stay in England, he went to the United States. During this visit, Vivekananda established Vedanta Societies in San Francisco and New York and founded a shanti ashrama (peace retreat) in California. He then went to Paris for the Congress <b>of</b> <b>Religions</b> in 1900. His lectures in Paris concerned the worship of the lingam and the authenticity of the Bhagavad Gita. Vivekananda then visited Brittany, Vienna, Istanbul, Athens and Egypt. The French philosopher Jules Bois was his host for most of this period, until he returned to Calcutta on 9 December 1900.|$|E
5|$|Hyderabad {{emerged as}} the {{foremost}} centre of culture in India with {{the decline of the}} Mughal Empire. After the fall of Delhi in 1857, the migration of performing artists to the city particularly from the north and west of the Indian sub continent, under the patronage of the Nizam, enriched the cultural milieu. This migration resulted in a mingling of North and South Indian languages, cultures and religions, which has since led to a co-existence of Hindu and Muslim traditions, for which the city has become noted. A further consequence of this north–south mix is that both Telugu and Urdu are official languages of Telangana. The mixing <b>of</b> <b>religions</b> has also resulted in many festivals being celebrated in Hyderabad such as Ganesh Chaturthi, Diwali and Bonalu of Hindu tradition and Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha by Muslims.|$|E
40|$|In {{many parts}} of the world, the {{significance}} <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> has increased during the last years and decades. In the sociology <b>of</b> <b>religion,</b> the secularization thesis was the dominant framework for the interpretation of developments in the realm <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> for a long time. Meanwhile, other explanation patterns have become more prominent, such as the indivi-dualization thesis and economic theories. The so-called “spatial turn ” {{does not seem to have}} reached sociology <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> yet. In history <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> (religious studies), however, questions of spatiality and locality are being studied intensively. Geography <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> has been regarded a diverse and incoherent field until recently. In the past years this has changed. Two directions of research have become apparent. One of them mainly considers social geographical problems and methods while the other has been influenced by the new cultural geography approach. Both should more frequently work with the above mentioned theoretical approaches <b>of</b> sociology <b>of</b> <b>religion.</b> Geography <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> must not, however, lose track of its main goal: it always has to point to the fact that all religious processes take place in space and have a spatial dimension.

5|$|The Church of Scientology depicts Hubbard in hagiographic {{terms and}} draws on his legacy as its {{ultimate}} source of doctrine and legitimacy. The Danish historian <b>of</b> <b>religions</b> Dorthe Refslund Christensen notes that {{many aspects of}} the official version of Hubbard's early life parallel more conventional religious narratives, notably the life of Jesus. Many details of Hubbard's early life remain disputed; critics of Scientology cast doubt on whether he had the educational and personal background claimed by the Church. According to James R. Lewis and Olav Hammer, in Scientology, this hagiographic “construction of Hubbard as a religious ideal implies the construction of Scientology’s texts as humanity’s most important treasure and vice versa.” Religious tradition in Scientology is based on two essential things, Hubbard’s individuality and texts written by him.|$|E

40|$|What {{counts as}} {{sociology}} <b>of</b> <b>religion?</b> The burden <b>of</b> a rich past In 1960, the Dutch {{journal of the}} Catholic Social-Ecclesial Institute (Kaski) Sociaal Kompas became Social Compass. This shift rounded off a period now considered as the heyday of Dutch sociology <b>of</b> <b>religion.</b> Ironically, in those years, Catholic sociologists in particular contested the legitimacy <b>of</b> taking <b>religion</b> {{as an object of}} sociological study. Each period in the history <b>of</b> sociology <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> appears to present a different face of it due to the interplay between the political field, the religious field, and the academic field, while the self-identification of its practitioners as sociologists <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> is far from self-evident. After 1980, further secularization resulted in a subsequent decline of chairs in sociology <b>of</b> <b>religion.</b> As direct, competitive government funding of academic research gained traction, the social-scientific study <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> continues to be funded. In so far as politicians and religious professionals continue to be concerned about issues such as the rise of Islam and new spirituality, the call for the social-scientific study <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> remains.
