40|$|Various {{upgrades}} {{were performed}} on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Beam Dumping System (LBDS) during Long Shutdown 1 (LS 1) at CERN, in particular to the Trigger Synchronisation and Distribution System (TSDS) : A redundant direct connection from the LHC Beam Interlock System to the re-trigger lines of the LBDS was implemented, a fully redundant powering architecture was set up, and new Trigger Synchronisation Unit cards were deployed over two separate crates instead of one. These hardware changes implied the adaptation of the State Control and Surveillance System and an improvement of the monitoring and diagnosis systems, like the various Internal Post <b>Operation</b> <b>Check</b> (IPOC) systems that ensure that, after every beam dump event, the LBDS worked as expected and is 'as good as new' for the next LHC beam.

3000|$|IR 2, a {{near-infrared}} {{camera in}} the 2 -μm region onboard Akatsuki has been developed to primarily study the middle-to-lower atmospheric dynamics of Venus as probed in the 1.74 - and 2.3 -μm “windows” of the CO_ 2 atmosphere on the night side. The spatial and temporal variability of CO below the clouds is also studied by differentiating 2.32 -μm CO-band images from simultaneous 2.26 -μm images. Images of the night-side disk in these wavelengths {{will enable us to}} determine the zonal and meridional winds near the cloud-base altitudes. IR 2 also images at 2.02  μm, the center of a CO_ 2 absorption band. Such images can visualize the variation of the cloud-top altitudes as contrast features due to different absorption path lengths of the reflected sunlight. Tracking of the 2.02 -μm features will also enable us to obtain wind information at the cloud-top level. Together with the other cameras and the radio science equipment on Akatsuki, IR 2 will contribute to understanding of the production and maintenance mechanism of super-rotation in the Venusian atmosphere. During cruise, IR 2 observed zodiacal light with a broad-band H filter (1.65  μm), imaged the Earth–moon remotely from a distance of [...] 30  million km, and determined Venus’s phase curves at small phase angles. We have just started the early phase <b>operation</b> <b>check</b> of IR 2 at Venus, as the orbit insertion in December 2015 was successful.|$|E
40|$|Background: For {{majority}} of people cancer means a serious suffering and concern about their own life. Within the cognitive model, which includes assessment, interpretation and evaluation related to cancer, the style of adaptation is developed according to what cancer means to patients, and its significance defines their emotional and behavioral response. The aim {{of this research was}} to established patients' reactions and emotional responses to cancer and influence of its presence on the development of adaptation process. Patients and methods: Thirty-six patients with gynecological and lung cancers and Hodgkin's lymphomas were asked to answer the questionnaire that had been previously developed {{for the purpose of this}} research. Results: Our results showed that the considerable percent of patients do not accept the term "cancer" as their diagnoses (50 % of patients accepted the term "tumor" and 8 % of them did not even know which disease they were suffering from). All patients clearly recognized which therapy belongs to an antineoplastic treatment. Emotional distress, defined as anxiety (irritation, tension, trouble, nervousness) was present in 23 % of patients. Thirty nine percent were depressive, 38. 8 % of them experienced significant weakness, while 12. 9 % suffered from insomnia. Fear for future was present in 45 % of patients, mostly women. Fatigue was the dominant symptom (47 % of patients) and alopecia was the most frequently observed therapy adverse effect. Conclusion: Since the oncologists in our country usually do not communicate the real diagnosis of cancer with patients, rejection is a common psychological defense mechanism especially among males. The {{majority of}} patients were not depressed, but the depression was more frequently expressed than anxiety, especially at transitional points during the disease (at diagnosis, waiting for <b>operation,</b> <b>check</b> ups, etc). Our results indicated that our cancer patients accomplished positive process of adaptation...|$|E

40|$|Synchrotron {{radiation}} monitor {{in the storage}} has been operated for a long time. This system is upgrading to booster operation now. The basic system includes optics, digital image acquisition, image analysis, compressed image transportation and visualization tools at workstation. The linearity and dynamic of new is discussed for some beam physics study. This system is also supported to the booster by new camera and addition operation. The hardware configuration and software structure will be summarized in this report. 1 INRODUCTION Imaging applications in the accelerator community are most often utilized to measure beam profile and interference fringes. The beam profile may convert form fluorescence, various optical diagnostics (SR, OTR, DR, etc.) [1, 2, 3]. Usually, the synchrotron light source {{radiation monitor}} measures beam profile and beam size of the synchrotron radiation light source in order for performance optimization, routine <b>operation</b> <b>check</b> and various beam physics studies. The monitor {{should be able to}} resolve minor transverse beam instability and movement. This tool has been useful for characterizing properties of electron beam analysis since its operation ten years ago. For example, the beam emittance is calculated from the measured beam size. By using digital IEEE 1394 camera system [3, 4], we are able to eliminate the frame-grabber stage of processing and directly transfer data at maximum rates of 400 MB/sec. To improve the desired functions of the synchrotron light monitoring system [5], a major upgrade of the data acquisition and analysis system has been implemented recently. The main goals are to increase signal transmission quality, the dynamic range, the linearity of the profile monitor, and better supports for data analysis. The integration of the system with the control system will be described in the following sections. Some results are also described in the system functional demonstration...|$|E
