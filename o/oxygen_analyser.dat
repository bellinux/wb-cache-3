30|$|Oxygen uptake {{represents}} another suitable parameter {{to monitor}} the oxidation reaction of linseed oil, usually performed with a luminescence <b>oxygen</b> <b>analyser</b> equipped with fibre optics (Oyman et al. 2005 a; Oyman et al. 2004). This type of <b>oxygen</b> <b>analyser</b> measures the quenching of luminescence caused by collisions between oxygen and luminescent dye molecules in the excited state. The oxygen uptake increased sharply up to 20 [*]h during oxidation of linseed oil in bulk at room temperature {{in the presence of}} Co(II)- 2 -ethylhexanoate (Co-EH) then declined to a steady state level (Oyman et al. 2005 a). Fibre optics-based measurements require a dark environment to prevent the ambient light being collected by the sensor (Wofbeis 1987). This effect can be corrected by applying optical isolation, although this slows down the response time by 4 [*]s to about less than 10 [*]s. A luminescence analyser is particularly suitable for quantitating oxygen dissolved in liquids. On the other hand, a paramagnetic <b>oxygen</b> <b>analyser</b> provides very precise measurements of the changes in oxygen concentration in the gas phase. This analyser has been applied with success to monitor oxygen uptake for self-heating materials, to derive kinetic rate parameters, especially for coal (Wang et al. 1999; Wang et al. 2002).|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} {{energetic}} costs of incubation {{in relation to}} clutch size, clutch sizes were manipulated and the metabolic rate of female great tits, Parus major (Linnaeus), during nocturnal incubation (MRinc) was measured using mobile <b>oxygen</b> <b>analysers.</b> Individuals were measured on consecutive nights while incubating their own or manipulated clutches.

Females spent more energy when incubating enlarged clutches as compared with controls (6 – 10 % more energy for three additional eggs) but did not spend significantly less energy when incubating reduced clutches. MRinc was strongly negatively related to ambient temperature. The effect of clutch enlargement is consistent with previous studies whereas the absence of an effect of clutch reduction is not. The small effect of clutch enlargement on MRinc highlights the need for further studies to include measurements of daily energy expenditure in order to judge how important energy expenditure can be in explaining fitness consequences of incubating experimentally enlarged clutches. ...|$|R

Most of them also analysed mixtures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in nitrogen. The percentage accuracy of the results was within 1 % of the expected value in only 14 % of determinations of carbon monoxide concentration, 28 % for carbon dioxide, 37 % for helium, and 48 % for oxygen. The accuracy of ratios of two concentrations of helium and carbon monoxide was better {{than that of the}} individual gas samples. Overall the variation in results between laboratories was wide, the coefficient of variation ranging from about 3 % for analysis of helium to 9 % for carbon dioxide. This variation affected the values calculated for carbon monoxide transfer factor, where 20 % were in error by more than 5 %, and for the calculated value of the respiratory exchange ratio, where the interlaboratory coefficient of variation was about 10 %. Errors in analysis were due to unsatisfactory calibration of analysers; five <b>oxygen</b> <b>analysers</b> had large zero errors; five carbon monoxide analysers and one helium analyser had notably curvilinear calibration curves.

Absorption laser spectroscopy in the mid-infrared is a direct method for the analysis of the 15 N isotopic composition of N 2 O, yet not sensitive enough for atmospheric N 2 O mixing ratios (320 ppb). To enable a fully-automated high precision analysis of N 2 O isotopic species at ambient mixing ratios, we built and optimized a liquid nitrogen-free preconcentration unit to be coupled to a quantum cascade laser (QCL) based spectrometer. During standard operation 10 l of ambient air are preconcentrated on a HayeSep D trap and desorbed in 50 ml of synthetic air. Rigorous tests were conducted, using FTIR, quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy (QCLAS), GC-FID and component-specific ozone and <b>oxygen</b> <b>analysers</b> to investigate recovery rates, conservation of isotopic signatures and spectral interferences after preconcentration.

40|$|RCR Energy Systems builds {{industrial}} heating plants and their control systems. In these the excess air (above the stoichiometric ratio) for combustion {{is a process}} variable and its setpoint is determined using a look-up table. RCR aims to improve the efficiency of wood-fired, thermal-oil heating plants by {{using a combination of}} carbon monoxide monitoring and oxygen trim control to automatically adjust the excess air setpoint. Heating plants require the correct amount of oxygen for combustion. Too little excess air does not allow complete combustion, producing a loss in efficiency and wasted fuel. Too much excess air reduces the flame temperature with a consequent drop in heat transfer rate and loss of efficiency. The aim of the project was to explore the advantages of carbon monoxide monitoring and oxygen trim control, as well as its application, design and implementation in trimming excess oxygen setpoint, to a lower, but still safe operating level.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{investigated}} the feasibility of using a phosphorescence <b>oxygen</b> <b>analyser</b> to measure cellular respiration (mitochondrial O 2 consumption) in foreskin samples and their fibroblast-rich cultures. Methods: Foreskin specimens from normal infants were collected immediately after circumcision and processed for measuring cellular respiration and for culture. Cellular mitochondrial O 2 consumption was determined {{as a function of}} time from the phosphorescence decay of the Pd (II) meso-tetra-(4 sulfonatophenyl) -tetrabenzoporphyrin. Results: In sealed vials containing a foreskin specimen and glucose, O 2 concentration decreased linearly with time, confirming the zero-order kinetics of O 2 consumption by cytochrome oxidase. Cyanide inhibited O 2 consumption,confirming that the oxidation occurred mainly in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The rate of foreskin respiration (mean ± SD) was 0. 074 ± 0. 02 μM O 2 min- 1 mg- 1 (n = 23). The corresponding rate for fibroblast-rich cultures was 9. 84 ± 2. 43 μM O 2 min- 1 per 107 cells (n = 15). Fibroblast respiration was significantly lower in a male infant with dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase gene mutations, but normalised with the addition of thiamine or carnitine.

40|$|Purpose - Understanding the {{critical}} process variables {{in a system}} and parameters that affects those critical variables will be a strong basis in developing the process control. At the end this will deliver process stability and predictability. Design/Methodology/Approach - Combustion efficiency typically indicates {{the ability of the}} burner to use fuel completely without generating carbon monoxide or leaving hydrocarbon unburned. Excess air is required to ensure a complete combustion of the fuel since a boiler firing without sufficient air or “fuel rich” is operating in a potentially dangerous condition. Getting the optimum combustion efficiency will require the accurate control of fuel gas and the air to deliver the just right amount. Field data analysis and the field experiment will be a basis to determine the applied process control works in maintaining {{the critical}} process variables. Findings - Daily and seasonal changes in temperature and barometric pressure can cause effect on the critical process variables in oil-recovery steam generator, such as steam pressure, temperature, steam dryness and the excess air. Better control means improved process stability, higher production efficiency, consistent product quality, and reduced energy waste. The fact is we pay substantial dollars every time firing the unit.

40|$|Measurements of {{the oxygen}} content of blood {{have been carried}} out for many years using a variety of methods many of which may be {{described}} as volumetric methods, e. g. Van Slyke and Natelson. In recent years methods applicable to small samples (10 - 20 /il blood) have been developed especially in relation to studies of comparative physiology. Volumetric methods depend upon the release of oxygen chemically bound with haemoglobin, which is frequently achieved by treatment with ferricyanide. With the release of oxygen the resulting increase in Po can be measured. If the volume is known then the quantity of oxygen released can be estimated. Methods using this principle have been developed by a number of authors including Fabel & Lubbers (1964) and a method using a small cuvette has been described by Tucker (1967).

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{accumulation}} of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been studied in plant cell suspension systems treated with bacterial pathogens. However, the associated utilization of molecular oxygen has not been well characterized. Using a multi-electrode <b>oxygen</b> <b>analyser,</b> the rates of oxygen consumption by tobacco cells during bacterial interactions were monitored. Heat-killed (HK) bacteria, which initiate an immediate ROS response in plant cells, were used as an elicitor to avoid complications of oxygen consumption by viable bacteria. An increase in oxygen uptake by the tobacco cells occurred within 4 min after addition of HK-bacteria and lasted for about 10 min, returning to a steady state at approximately twice the initial basal rate. The initial burst in oxygen uptake coincided with production of H 202. Calculation of the total oxygen consumption by the plant cells indicated that less than 5 % of the increased oxygen uptake was utilized in ROS production. Use of respiratory inhibitors indicated that respiration, especially the cytochrome pathway, {{played a significant role}} in this response. Results from the use of K- 252, a protein kinase inhibitor, and DPI, an inhibitor of membrane bound NADPH oxidases, indicated that triggering of the oxygen uptake response may involve protein phosphorylation and is at least partially activated by the membrane bound NADPH oxidase activity. The involvement of mitochondrial respiration in the oxygen uptake response described here indicates that early events in plant recognition of pathogens involves more of the cellular machinery than previously hypothesized...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} use of a biological quality control programme for a computer controlled, breath-by-breath exercise test system over a 2. 5 year period.  METHODS—One healthy volunteer performed a regular progressive treadmill test with breath-by-breath measurements of oxygen uptake (V̇O 2), carbon dioxide output (V̇CO 2), ventilation (V̇E), and the ECG heart rate (HR). Following a familiarisation period, five consecutive tests were performed and the measurements at peak exercise were averaged to give baseline values. All tests were compared with these values.  RESULTS—A total of 35 tests were recorded. The within subject standard deviation for measurements at peak exercise were 52 ml/min for V̇O 2, 74 ml/min for V̇CO 2, 3. 1 l/min for V̇E, and 3 beats/min for HR. The mean (SE) percentage variation in measurements at peak exercise compared with the baseline values was + 0. 37 (0. 30) % for V̇O 2, - 0. 10 (0. 39) % for V̇CO 2, - 0. 88 (0. 52) % for V̇E, and + 1. 2 (0. 26) % for HR. The variability present in measurements made during high and moderate intensity exercise (73 % V̇O 2 peak) was not significantly different (p> 0. 05). During the study period the quality control detected a fault on the <b>oxygen</b> <b>analyser</b> which was not apparent from the automatic calibration.  CONCLUSIONS—Regular quality control using a healthy volunteer allows all components of the breath-by-breath system to be checked simultaneously and in a manner which is consistent with its clinical use. This practice can highlight faults not detected by automatic calibration. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: For many {{patients}} clinical prescription of walking will {{be beneficial to}} health and accelerometer scan be used to monitor their walking intensity, frequency and duration over many days. Walking intensity should include establishment of individual specific accelerometer count, walking speed and energy expenditure (VO 2) relationships and this can be achieved using a walking protocol on a treadmill or overground. However, differences in gait mechanics during treadmill compared to overground walking may result in inaccurate estimations of freeliving walking speed and VO 2. The aims {{of this study were}} to compare the validity of track- and treadmill-based calibration methods for estimating free-living level walking speed and VO 2 and to explain between-method differences in accuracy of estimation. Methods: Fifty healthy adults [32 women and 18 men; mean (SD) : 40 (13) years] walked at four pre-determined speeds on an outdoor track and a treadmill, and completed three 1 -km self-paced level walks while wearing an Actigraph monitor and a mobile <b>oxygen</b> <b>analyser.</b> Speed- and VO 2 -to-Actigraph count individual calibration equations were computed for each calibration method. Between-method differences in calibration equation parameters, prediction errors, and relationships of walking speed with VO 2 and Actigraph counts were assessed. Results: The treadmill-calibration equation overestimated free-living walking speed (on average, by 0. 7 km · h− 1) and VO 2 (by 4. 99 ml · kg− 1 · min− 1), while the track-calibration equation did not. This was because treadmill walking, from which the calibration equation was derived, produced lower Actigraph counts and higher VO 2 for a given walking speed compared to walking on a track. The prediction error {{associated with the use of}} the treadmill calibration method increased with free-living walking speed. This issue was not observed when using the track calibration method. Conclusions: The proposed track-based individual accelerometer calibration method can provide accurate and unbiased estimates of free-living walking speed and VO 2 from walking.

Amounts of oxide in recycled chips were measured by using oxygen-nitrogen <b>analyser.</b> <b>Oxygen</b> concentration in the recycled specimens increased proportionally with the total surface area of the machined chip per unit volume. The performance of recycled aluminium chip on their mechanical properties and microstructure were compared with the reference specimen. The recycled specimens exhibited a remarkable potential in the strength properties (Ultimate Tensile Strength, UTS = 30. 73 - 1 17. 85 MPa, Elongation to Failure, ETF = 3. 84 - 1 1. 84 %) where it increased with increment of total surface area of chips. This is mainly attributed to grain refmernent (7. 90 - 19. 50 pm) of the microstucture. On the other hand, recycled specimens with medium surface area of chips posed highest elongation to failure (I 1. 84 %). Grain size and oxide amount of billet {{have an effect on}} the elongation of recycled materials. Analysis for different operating temperatures showed that the higher temperatures (520 °C) gave better result on mechanical properties (UTS = 117. 85 MPa) and finer microstructure (7. 90 pm). In this study, the recycled AA 6061 chip showed the good potentiaI as the comparison of using only 17. 5 % of suggested pressure where 70. 0 MF'a (maximum operating pressure) from 400. 0 MPa (suggested optimum pressure) exhibited 35. 8 % the ultimate tensile strength where 117. 85 MFa (maximum tensile strength for recycled billet) from 327. 69 MPa (reference). This proved that hot forging process could be an acceptable alternative method for recycling of AA 6061 a l ~ i n u mall oy chips...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was performed on}} characterisation of automotive shredder residue which resulted in application of its polymeric fraction {{as a substitute for}} coke, as reducing agent, in magnetite iron-ore composite pellets. In Australia aloan, nearly 200, 000 tonnes of automotive shredder residue is landfilled every year. This thesis aims to characterise this waste stream and come up with an idea to apply it in proper way and prevent it to go to the land. On the other hand iron making industry specifically blast furnace and its feed stock consumes a huge amount of worlds energy and resources. It was anticipated that shredder residues could be reused for its energy and composition aspect in iron making process. Samples were collected from an Australian shredder and were analysed for their composition and size distribution. Initial visual inspection confirmed the ASR as a very heterogeneous stream of waste and due to this heterogeneity application based on specific composition seemed to be out of prospect as it needs rigorous and costly separation processes. As result, the simple approach of size distribution, energy value and carbon content was considered as the bases for this study. It was realized that this waste consist of majorly high heat content materials with high carbon and hydrogen, metals and inorganics. The high energy content portion were analysed for their level of calorific value {{to come up with a}} representative range with purpose of nominating an effective re-application process. Charring process for analysis of carbon content was done based on standard ASTM E 1755 - 01. This was followed by burning the carbon content to derive the ash. Composition of ash was studied for oxide and element content using XRF. Calorific value analysis was done to determine the right fraction of ASR for the application of heat recovery and the source of carbon. These characterisations led to the understanding of the heat value and carbon content of each size fraction of ASR. This high heat and carbon content of the ASR were realised to be majorly due to the polymeric content. As result it was selected for further application. It was realised that the palletisation of iron oxide with this polymeric portion of ASR, as the source of carbon and energy, would be an attractive choice due to the versatility of palletisation process. Pellets were then made from concentrated magnetite provided by the OneSteel Whyalla. The source of carbon in the pellet was set to be 100 % metallurgical coke, 50 % ASR, 70 % ASR and 100 % ASR. The concentrated magnetite is the major source of iron-ore used in the OneSteels pellet plants. This magnetite was mixed with metallurgical coke, and flux, which basically is the milled limestone, before formed in to pellets and heat treated. These pellets are then fed into the blast furnace for iron extraction. Flux was not used in this project to minimise the effect of other oxides on the overall process. To make the pellets, the raw were mixed together and formed in to the ball-shape pellets and dried in 1050 C for 24 hrs in the oven. The reduction process was then performed in horizontal tube furnace in 12000 C under argon gas flow for 20 min. Various qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed to determine the level of reduction in pellets. Gas products were captured and in-situ infrared gas analyser was applied to measure the concentration of generated CO, CO 2 and CH 4 gases. The reduction was then calculated based on the weight reduction of the pellets by measuring the weight of pellets before and after process. Oxygen and carbon content of pellets were measured by means of LECO <b>oxygen</b> and carbon <b>analyser</b> to be compare with weight reduction and IR analyses. Analysis of reduced pellets was also performed physically and chemically with help of optical and electron microscopy (SEM-EDS) and XRD analysis. Compressive strength of pellets then was performed on two sets of pellets before and after high temperature reaction. The result for reduced pellets was compared with the standards pellets provided by OneSteel Whyalla blast furnace. This feasibility study has shown that there is possibility for the ASR to be used in the iron reduction process and specially blast furnace process application...|$|R
