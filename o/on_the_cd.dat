The album received mixed reviews, but Downey stated in 2006 that he probably will not do another album, as {{he felt that the}} energy he put into doing the album was not compensated.|$|E
5000|$|For [...] problems, use the LL scales. When several LL {{scales are}} present, use {{the one with}} x on it. First, align <b>the</b> leftmost 1 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>C</b> scale with x <b>on</b> <b>the</b> LL scale. Then, find y <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>C</b> scale and {{go down to the}} LL scale with x on it. That scale will {{indicate}} the answer. If y is [...] "off the scale," [...] locate [...] and square it using the A and B scales as described above. Alternatively, use <b>the</b> rightmost 1 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>C</b> scale, and read the answer off the next higher LL scale. For example, aligning <b>the</b> rightmost 1 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>C</b> scale with 2 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> LL2 scale, 3 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>C</b> scale lines up with 8 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> LL3 scale.|$|R

5|$|The White Stripes had a {{carefully}} constructed image built around lore they created {{for themselves and}} visual motifs. Early in their history, they turned down a potential deal with Chicago label Bobsled, because the label wanted to put its green logo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>CD.</b> Their presentation was a subject of intrigue among the public and in the media.|$|E
5|$|The Sam & Max {{franchise}} {{features a}} variety of soundtracks that accompany its video game products. This music is mostly grounded in film noir jazz, incorporating various other styles at certain points, such as Dixieland, waltz and mariachi, usually to support the cartoon nature of the series. The first Sam & Max game, Sam & Max Hit the Road, {{was one of the}} first games to feature a fully scored music soundtrack, written by LucasArts' composers Clint Bajakian, Michael Land and Peter McConnell. The music was incorporated into the game using Land and McConnell's iMUSE engine, which allowed for audio to be synchronized with the visuals. Although the full soundtrack was never released, audio renders of four of the game's MIDI tracks were included <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>CD</b> version of the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} later than One Little Indian Records had intended. Björk was behind schedule and the album's cover design by Nick Knight needed a reshoot. Towards {{the end of}} August 1997, One Little Indian delayed the album by a month. Homogenic was released on September 22, 1997 on One Little Indian in the United Kingdom and on September 23 Elektra Records in North America on compact disc and cassette. The album was later issued on vinyl and DualDisc formats. The Japanese version of Homogenic included several bonus tracks and remixed versions of songs. The DualDisc release featured the full album <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>CD</b> side and the DVD side included the album with superior sound quality and the music videos for the singles.|$|E

5|$|The {{pieces were}} {{arranged}} by Masashi Hamauzu, {{one of the}} composers for Final Fantasy X, along with Jonne Valtonen and Roger Wanamo, and the arranged works are based on compositions by him and Nobuo Uematsu, who acts as a consultant for the concerts. Thomas Böcker is producing the concerts, {{as he had done}} for numerous other video game music concerts in Germany, Sweden and Japan (Symphonic Game Music Concert series). Eckehard Stier conducts, who is experienced in the field of video game music due to his work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>CD</b> album Drammatica by Yoko Shimomura and the Symphonic Fantasies concerts in Tokyo. The concert featured pianist Benyamin Nuss in 2013 (Wuppertal and London), Mischa Cheung in 2014 (Tampere), with Katharina Treutler being the main pianist of the concert series, performing at the events in Tokyo, Aarhus and Stockholm in 2014, and Amsterdam, San Diego, Baltimore and San Francisco in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Zimmer wrote {{several hours}} of music, and an {{abundance}} of different themes, before Malick started to shoot the film. The director played the music on the set, while filming, to get himself, {{and the rest of}} the crew and actors in the right frame of mind. The official soundtrack features tracks that were not used on the film and some tracks from the film are not found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>CD.</b> The film features several pieces of Melanesian choral music sung by the Choir of All Saints in Honiara, only one of which is featured on the soundtrack. However, another soundtrack was released containing several tracks from the Choir, which has since gone out of circulation.|$|E
5|$|An {{official}} {{video for}} the remix version produced by HarDrum was included <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>CD</b> {{format of the}} single; it included unreleased footage that did not appear on the original version, featuring different angle shots of the girls, expressions from the public's faces and the band performing erratically. It also included various scenes of people on-set helping with the music video's production, and one holding the wired fence. In July and September 2015, the group uploaded two teaser videos of a remix version produced by Fly Dream in order to commemorate the single's 15th anniversary on 19 December that same year; by then, it still remained unreleased. On 7 August 2016, one year since the two trailers, t.A.T.u. uploaded an HD version of the video with new unreleased scenes and extended footage. Lasting five minutes and 37 seconds, it showed an extended cut of the girls arguing next to the brick wall and walking {{around the corner to}} find the vast Khodynka Field with a clearer cityscape in the distance by the fourth minute. The ending of the video portrays t.A.T.u. in the distance, similar to the original video.|$|E
