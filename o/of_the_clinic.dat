5|$|During Sanger's 1916 {{speaking}} tour, she promoted {{birth control}} clinics {{based on the}} Dutch model she had observed during her 1914 trip to Europe. Although she inspired many local communities to create birth control leagues, no clinics were established. Sanger therefore resolved to create a birth control clinic in New York that would provide free contraceptive services to women. New York state law prohibited the distribution of contraceptives or even contraceptive information, but Sanger hoped to exploit {{a provision in the}} law which permitted doctors to prescribe contraceptives for the prevention of disease. On October 16, 1916, she opened the Brownsville clinic in Brooklyn; it was an immediate success, with over 100 women visiting on the first day.Engelman, p. 79–80. A few days after opening, an undercover policewoman purchased a cervical cap at the clinic, and Sanger was arrested. Refusing to walk, Sanger and a co-worker were dragged out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinic</b> by police officers.Engelman, p. 83. The clinic was shut down, and it was not until 1923 that another birth control clinic was opened in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Four {{years after}} the New York Court of Appeals opened the doors for {{physicians}} to prescribe contraceptives, Sanger opened a second birth control clinic, which she staffed with physicians to make it legal under that court ruling (the first clinic had employed nurses). This second clinic, the Clinical Research Bureau (CRB), opened on January 2, 1923. To avoid police harassment the clinic's existence was not publicized, its primary mission was stated to be conducting scientific research, and it only provided services to married women. The existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinic</b> was finally announced {{to the public in}} December 1923, but this time there were no arrests or controversy. This convinced activists that, after ten years of struggle, birth control had finally become widely accepted in the United States. The CRB was the first legal birth control clinic in the United States, and quickly grew into the world's leading contraceptive research center.|$|E
40|$|At Rowan University, {{design has}} been infused into the {{curriculum}} through an eight-semester course sequence called <b>the</b> Engineering <b>Clinics.</b> Through this experience, students learn the art and science of design in a multidisciplinary team environment and hone their design skills throughout their 4 -year career. This paper describes <b>the</b> objectives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinics,</b> types <b>of</b> projects, and how <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> complement traditional core courses in the curriculum. Impacts and benefits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> on students and faculty are discussed, including retention and graduate study rates comparing Rowan University mechanical engineering students to their peers nationally. An assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> is presented based on survey data and accreditation objectives and outcomes. Survey data from students were assessed to determine levels of students 2 ̆ 7 satisfaction and confidence based on <b>the</b> <b>clinics.</b> Results <b>of</b> alumni and employer surveys also provide valuable feedback for assessing and improving <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> as well as confirmation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>clinics</b> after graduation. Survey data are discussed along with challenges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> at Rowan and adaptability of them at other institutions.

5|$|Himmler met {{his future}} wife, Margarete Boden, in 1927. Seven years his senior, {{she was a}} nurse who shared his {{interest}} in herbal medicine and homoeopathy, and was part owner of a small private clinic. They were married in July 1928, and their only child, Gudrun, was born on 8 August 1929. The couple were also foster parents to a boy named Gerhard von Ahe, son of an SS officer who had died before the war. Margarete sold her share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinic</b> and used the proceeds to buy a plot of land in Waldtrudering, near Munich, where they erected a prefabricated house. Himmler was constantly away on party business, so his wife took charge of their efforts—mostly unsuccessful—to raise livestock for sale. They had a dog, Töhle.|$|E

25|$|In the Clinic sample, 100 severe alcoholics {{treated at}} the clinic were {{followed}} for 8 years. The clinic’s methods were multi-modal: detoxification and hospital treatment followed by referral to AA. At {{the end of the}} 8 years, 34% of subjects had achieved stable abstinence, 29% had died, and 26% were still abusing alcohol, and the evidence was that other clinical studies had reported similar lack of success. Subjects who had a stable social environment or who frequently went to AA meetings had the highest rates of abstinence. Overall, however, treatment other than AA did not significantly improve the subjects’ outcome. In fact Vaillant reports the dismal fact that fully 95% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinic</b> sample had relapsed at some time during the 8-year study period. Vaillant noted that clinical treatment helped only in the short term, as crisis intervention and detox. There was one indicator, a financial one, of short-term success: clinical intervention had significantly reduced the cost of future health care for the alcoholics.|$|E
25|$|On April 15 {{humanitarian}} aid organizations were granted {{access to the}} camp {{for the first time}} since the invasion had begun. Palestinian Red Crescent Society and International Committee of the Red Cross staff entered the camp, accompanied by the IDF. Officials from the Red Crescent told lawyer Hassan Jabareen that the IDF did not allow them to move around the camps freely, and that advanced decomposition, as well as the enormous destruction in the camp, made it impossible to find and retrieve bodies without the proper equipment. That same day Adalah and LAW, the Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment, filed a petition asking the Court to order the IDF to immediately hand over the bodies of Palestinians to the Red Cross or the Red Crescent, saying that the bodies of dead Palestinians were being left to rot in the camp.

500|$|Two {{weeks after}} filing suit against Planned Parenthood, Bevin sued EMW Women's Clinic in Lexington, {{claiming}} {{that it was}} an unlicensed abortion facility. The clinic had been operating without a license under an exemption granted to private physician's offices, but an inspection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinic</b> – the first conducted since 2006 – revealed that the facility performed abortions exclusively. Inspectors also reported [...] "several unsafe and unsanitary conditions" [...] including the presence of expired medications. EMW ceased performing abortions March 9, pending the outcome of the lawsuit. On March 18, Fayette County Circuit Judge Ernesto Scorsone declined to issue a cease and desist order to EMW, finding that the first trimester abortions performed there [...] "do not require sedation or the services of an anesthesiologist", suggesting that the clinic was a physician's office. Scorsone also said the clinic served the public interest by providing abortion services for the eastern half of the state. The administration appealed Scorsone's decision, and on June 15, a three-judge panel from the Kentucky Court of Appeals ruled Scorsone's decision in error and issued a temporary injunction against EMW, prohibiting them from performing abortions until and unless the case was eventually resolved in its favor. The Kentucky Supreme Court sustained the injunction in August.|$|E

[...] He said that he eventually became unconscious and had to be fed intravenously. In a court deposition unrelated to alleged child abuse, he was visibly drowsy, lacked concentration and repeatedly slurred while speaking. He could not remember the dates of his prior album releases or names of people he had worked with and took several minutes to name some of his recent albums. His health had deteriorated {{to the extent that he}} canceled the remainder of his tour and flew with Taylor and her husband to London. When Jackson arrived at the airport, he had to be held up; he was then rushed to the home of Elton John's manager and afterwards to a clinic, but when he was searched for drugs on entry, 18 vials of medicine were found in a suitcase.
