The Allied navies largely abandoned the naval base at Darwin after the initial 19 February attack, dispersing most of their forces to Brisbane, Fremantle, and other smaller seaports. Conversely, Allied air commanders launched a build-up in the Darwin area, building more airfields and deploying many squadrons.|$|E

50|$|Other {{features}} of the machinery space were five liquid storage tanks: two large <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tanks</b> on the centre of each wing, with two day service <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tanks</b> just forward of the former, which supplied fuel to all engines by gravity feed. The fifth tank was used to store lubrication oil, and this was generally sited {{on the port side}} aft area of the space.

50|$|The {{conversion}} was {{not entirely}} successful since the metacentric height was reduced, making the boats roll heavily on the surface in rough weather. This was alleviated in 1953 in those conversions which had been completed by increasing the buoyancy by raising the capacity of a main ballast tank by 50 tons. This was done by merging it with an existing emergency <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank.</b> For the four boats remaining to be converted, increase in buoyancy was achieved by lengthening the extra hull section to be inserted from 14 ft (4.3 m) to 17 ft 6 in (5.33 m). The effect was to lengthen the control room and strict instructions were issued that this space {{was not to be}} used for extra equipment otherwise the improved buoyancy would be affected.|$|R

The 1989 grounding of the Argentinean ship Bahia Paraiso and subsequent spillage of 640000 L of oil into the sea near the Antarctic Peninsula showed the environmental hazards inherent in supply missions to Antarctica.|$|R
25|$|Some power {{stations}} burn <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> rather than coal.

500|$|Bey, {{now using}} Hans Lody as his flagship, left port {{on the morning}} of 6 December with [...] and Z11 Bernd von Arnim to lay a {{minefield}} off Cromer. The latter ship had severe boiler problems and was ordered to return to port in the late afternoon while the other two continued their mission. They spotted several darkened ships as they approached their destination, including the destroyers [...] and , but were not spotted in return. As the two German destroyers withdrew after having laid their mines, they spotted the two British destroyers again at a range of [...] and closed to attack. When the range dropped to , Lody fired three torpedoes at Juno, the leading British ship, while Giese fired four at Jersey. None of Lodys torpedoes struck their target, but one of Gieses hit Jersey abreast her aft torpedo mount. The torpedo detonated in an <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> and started a major fire. Neither British ship spotted the German destroyers and they continued on while Juno turned about to help her sister. Two British ships totalling 5,286 GRT were sunk by this minefield. Hans Lody began a refit at Wesermünde on 9 December that was not finished until 22 May 1940.|$|R
