40|$|The present {{overview}} {{is intended}} to point the readers’ attention to the important subject of calcium <b>orthophosphates.</b> These materials are of the special significance because they represent the inorganic part of major normal (bones, teeth and dear antlers) and pathological (i. e. those appearing due to various diseases) calcified tissues of mammals. Due to a great chemical similarity with the biological calcified tissues, many calcium <b>orthophosphates</b> possess remarkable biocompatibility and bioactivity. Materials scientists use this property extensively to construct artificial bone grafts that are either entirely made of or only surface-coated with the biologically relevant calcium <b>orthophosphates.</b> For example, self-setting hydraulic cements made of calcium <b>orthophosphates</b> are helpful in bone repair, while titanium substitutes covered by a surface layer of calcium <b>orthophosphates</b> are used for hip joint endoprostheses and as tooth substitutes. Porous scaffolds made of calcium <b>orthophosphates</b> are very promising tools for tissue engineering applications. In addition, technical grade calcium <b>orthophosphates</b> are very popular mineral fertilizers. Thus ere calcium <b>orthophosphates</b> are of great significance for humankind and, in this paper, an overview on the current knowledge on this subject is provided...|$|R

25|$|The anion {{after the}} first dissociation, H2PO, is the dihydrogen {{phosphate}} anion. The anion after the second dissociation, HPO, is the hydrogen phosphate anion. The anion after the third dissociation, PO, is the phosphate, or <b>orthophosphate,</b> anion. For each of the dissociation reactions shown above, there is a separate acid dissociation constant, called Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3 given at 25°C. Associated with these three dissociation constants are corresponding pKa1 = 2.12, pKa2 = 7.21, and pKa3 = 12.67 values at 25°C. Even though all three hydrogen (H) atoms are equivalent on an orthophosphoric acid molecule, the successive Ka values differ, since it is energetically less favorable to lose another H+ if one (or more) has already been lost and the molecule/ion is more negatively charged.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to a lack}} of septate hyphae, a coenocytic, {{transfer}} cell-like structure {{characterizes the}} Hartig net of many ectomycorrhizas, which facilitates interhyphal transport. Wall ingrowths in Pisonia, for example, resemble those found in other plant species where transfer cells yield high rates of nutrient transport between apoplast and symplast. Overall, ectomycorrhizal fungi receive approximately 15% of the net primary production and can provide up to 86% of a host’s nitrogen needs. Carbon allocation {{has been shown to be}} correlated with growth rates and nutrient availability. Belowground allocation is highest when nutrient availability is low and when growth rates are reduced. Phosphorus is another typically limiting nutrient in many terrestrial ecosystems. Evidence suggests that phosphorus is transferred largely as inorganic <b>orthophosphate.</b> Some mat-forming ectomycorrhizas contain ribonucleases capable of rapidly hydrolyzing DNA in order to obtain phosphorus from nuclei.|$|E
40|$|Preparation of {{phosphogypsum}} {{to produce}} the binders requires a much higher input than preparation of natural gypsum stone. This makes it uncompetitive material. The investigations presented therein are meant to reduce this input by looking for the ways of rendering impurities harmless. Soluble acid <b>orthophosphates</b> are the main harmful impurity of phosphogypsum. The studies show that dry insoluble calcium <b>orthophosphates</b> hydrates (1. 09 % and 2. 18 % P 2 O 5 in gypsum) have little effect on W/C, setting times and soundness of Portland cement pastes. Insoluble calcium <b>orthophosphates</b> hydrates {CaHPO 4 ∙ 2 H 2 O, Ca 8 (HPO 4) 2 (PO 4) 4 ∙ 5 H 2 O and Ca 9 (HPO 4) (PO 4) 5 (OH) ∙ 4 H 2 O} formed in acidic medium (pH = 4. 2 - 5. 9) have been destroyed in alkaline medium and reduce standard compressive strength of cement up to 28 %. Calcium <b>orthophosphates</b> hydrates of hydroxyapatite group are stable in alcaline medium, while in dry state they reduce the standard compressive strength of cement until 10 %, but their suspensions prolong setting times of Portland cement as soluble <b>orthophosphates</b> – 2 - 3 times. Alkalis in cement increase pH of paste, but do not change the process of formation of calcium <b>orthophosphates</b> hydrates of hydroxyapatite group: it takes place through an intermediate phase - CaHPO 4 · 2 H 2 O, whose transformation into apatite lasts for 2 - 3 months...|$|R
30|$|As {{follows from}} the definition, all types of wet {{deposition}} techniques occur from either solutions or suspensions both aqueous and non-aqueous. Furthermore, all of them occur at moderate temperatures (Nijhuis et al. 2010). Depending on the solution pH, various calcium <b>orthophosphates</b> might be precipitated (Table[*] 1) and, therefore, be deposited as coatings, films and layers. In general, the deposition kinetics depends on the solution supersaturation, concentration of the reagents, temperature, {{presence or absence of}} admixtures, nucleators, inhibitors, etc. As to the precipitation mechanism of calcium <b>orthophosphates</b> from aqueous solutions, this process appears to be rather complicated; for the biologically relevant calcium <b>orthophosphates</b> (OCP, CDHA and HA), the crystallization process occurs via formation of one or several intermediate and/or precursor phases, such as ACP, DCPD and/or OCP. The detailed description of the precipitation mechanisms of various calcium <b>orthophosphates</b> {{is beyond the scope of}} current review; the interested readers are referred to the special literature on the topic (Wang and Nancollas 2008; Wang et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in biomineralization have already demonstrated that nanosized particles {{play an important}} role in the formation of hard tissues of animals. Namely, the basic inorganic building blocks of bones and teeth of mammals are nanodimensional and nanocrystalline calcium <b>orthophosphates</b> (in the form of apatites) of a biological origin. In mammals, tens to hundreds nanocrystals of a biological apatite were found to be combined into self-assembled structures under the control of various bioorganic matrixes. In addition, the structures of both dental enamel and bones could be mimicked by an oriented aggregation of nanosized calcium <b>orthophosphates,</b> determined by the biomolecules. The application and prospective use of nanodimensional and nanocrystalline calcium <b>orthophosphates</b> for a clinical repair of damaged bones and teeth are also known. For example, a greater viability and a better proliferation of various types of cells were detected on smaller crystals of calcium <b>orthophosphates.</b> Thus, the nanodimensional and nanocrystalline forms of calcium <b>orthophosphates</b> have a great potential to revolutionize the field of hard tissue engineering starting from bone repair and augmentation to the controlled drug delivery devices. This paper reviews current state of knowledge and recent developments of this subject starting from the synthesis and characterization to biomedical and clinical applications. More to the point, this review provides possible directions of future research and development...|$|R

500|$|In 1815, the Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius {{analysed}} {{an unusual}} sample of gadolinite from a copper mine in Falun, central Sweden. He noted impregnated traces {{of a white}} mineral, which he cautiously assumed to be an earth (oxide in modern chemical nomenclature) of an unknown element. Berzelius had already discovered two elements, cerium and selenium, but {{he had made a}} public mistake once, announcing a new element, gahnium, {{that turned out to be}} zinc oxide. Berzelius privately named the putative element [...] "thorium" [...] in 1817 and its supposed oxide [...] "thorina" [...] after Thor, the Norse god of thunder. In 1824, after more deposits of the same mineral in Vest-Agder, Norway, were discovered, he retracted his findings, as the mineral proved to be mostly yttrium <b>orthophosphate.</b> As the yttrium in this mineral was initially mistaken for a new element, the mineral was named kenotime by the French mineralogist François Sulpice Beudant as a rebuke of Berzelius, from the Greek words κενός (kenos; [...] "empty") and τιμή (timē; [...] "honour"). This became [...] "xenotime" [...] as a misprint from the beginning, blunting the criticism. This misspelt form was later explained as being from ξένος (xenos; [...] "alien") and τιμή, supposedly in reference to the small, rare and easily overlooked crystals that xenotime occurs as.|$|E
500|$|Europium is {{associated}} with the other rare-earth elements and is, therefore, mined together with them. Separation of the rare-earth elements {{is a step in the}} later processing. Rare-earth elements are found in the minerals bastnäsite, loparite-(Ce), xenotime, and monazite in mineable quantities. Bastnäsite is an <b>orthophosphate</b> mineral [...] (Ln denotes a mixture of all the lanthanides except promethium), loparite-(Ce) is an oxide, and xenotime is a fluorocarbonate LnCO3F. Monazite also contains thorium and yttrium, which complicates handling because thorium and its decay products are radioactive. For the extraction from the ore and the isolation of individual lanthanides, several methods have been developed. The choice of method is based on the concentration and composition of the ore and on the distribution of the individual lanthanides in the resulting concentrate. Roasting the ore and subsequent acidic and basic leaching is used mostly to produce a concentrate of lanthanides. If cerium is the dominant lanthanide, then it is converted from cerium(III) to cerium(IV) and then precipitated. Further separation by solvent extractions or ion exchange chromatography yields a fraction which is enriched in europium. This fraction is reduced with zinc, zinc/amalgam, electrolysis or other methods converting the europium(III) to europium(II). Europium(II) reacts in a way similar to that of alkaline earth metals and therefore it can be precipitated as carbonate or is co-precipitated with barium sulfate. Europium metal is available through the electrolysis of a mixture of molten EuCl3 and NaCl (or CaCl2) in a graphite cell, which serves as cathode, using graphite as anode. The other product is chlorine gas.|$|E

40|$|Aims: This {{research}} was conducted to determine the concentration of Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, Cr and <b>orthophosphates</b> in the soil of the river bed from Zayandehrood dam to Gavkhoni wetland. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} the Zayandehrood river of Isfahan, central area of Iran. Seventeen points were sampled through the upstream, Zayandehrood Dam, and downstream, Gavkhooni Wetland, of the river. The samples were selected from soil of the river bed at certain locations during 6 months. Heavy metals and <b>orthophosphates</b> analysis was done by Atomic Absorption and Spectrophotometry methods, respectively. Results: The results indicated that concentration of heavy metals and <b>orthophosphates</b> increased from upstream to Choom bridge in downstream of the river and then decreased from this point to Govkhooni wetland. In the first sampling point, the concentration of Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, Cr and <b>orthophosphates</b> were 29, 9, 51, 83, 49, and 570 mg/kg (dried weight).

[...] In 2004, the Fremont–Winema National Forest studied the impact of recreational residence permits on the lake environment. [...] The assessment identified the early signs of shoreline erosion.

2500|$|Further {{modifications}} to the MLE were to come: [...] Bardenpho and Biodenipho processes include additional anoxic and oxidative processes to further polish the conversion of nitrate ion to molecular nitrogen gas. [...] Use of an anaerobic tank following the initial anoxic process allows for luxury uptake of phosphorus by bacteria, thereby biologically reducing <b>orthophosphate</b> ion in the treated wastewater. [...] Even newer improvements, such as Anammox Process, interrupt the formation of nitrate at the nitrite stage of nitrification, shunting nitrite-rich mixed liquor activated sludge to treatment where nitrite is then converted to molecular nitrogen gas, saving energy, alkalinity, and secondary carbon sourcing. Anammox™ (ANaerobic AMMonia OXidation) works by artificially extending detention time and preserving denitrifiying bacteria {{through the use of}} substrate added to the mixed liquor and continuously recycled from it prior to secondary clarification. Many other proprietary schemes are being deployed, including DEMON™, Sharon-ANAMMOX™, ANITA-Mox™, and DeAmmon™.

50|$|Phosphorus occurs {{naturally}} in both organic and inorganic forms.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{eutrophication}} in lakes {{and the open}} seas has been largely the result of phosphorus (P) that accumulate in the sediment. Eutrophication occurs mainly in the waters in densely populated coastal areas and agricultural dominated areas and occurs when an excess of nutrients reach the soil and water. In situ capping is a proven method to inhibit P and is the method used in this study. A capping {{is placed on the}} polluted sediment surface to physically isolate it and reduce the release of P and prevent resuspension, i. e. suspension of already precipitated P. The possibility of inhibiting P by using sediment capping and the reactive filter materials (sorbents) argon oxygen decarburisation (AOD) slag in particle size fractions 0 - 0. 5 mm and 2 - 8 mm and electric arc furnace (EAF) slag in particle size fraction 1 - 2. 36 mm, have been investigated. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), also called <b>orthophosphates,</b> were the main species of P investigated in this study. A total of three studies were conducted in Lake Erhai in Dali China, during April 2016. One pre-study was conducted at ten different sites in the lake, which aimed to find the most P polluted site. This site was chosen for the main study. The main study aimed to investigate if the aforementioned sorbents managed to absorb  <b>orthophosphates</b> after contact with lake sediment for seven days. The post-study was conducted to see if the sorbents themselves released any <b>orthophosphates</b> into the water. The water samples were tested for pH, conductivity and dissolved oxygen (DO) before and after contact with lake sediment. The slag materials and lake sediment were studied with inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to detect elements and compounds. Obtained results showed that the AOD slag (0 - 0. 5 mm) could absorb 96 % of the <b>orthophosphates.</b> However, both the AOD slag (2 - 8 mm) and EAF slag (1 - 2. 36 mm) showed an increase of <b>orthophosphates</b> in the water after contact with lake sediment. The XRD analysis showed contents of silica (Si) and calcium (Ca) compounds in all of the slag materials, which was expected due to the configuration of these materials. The ICP analysis showed that 2 % P was absorbed by the EAF (1 - 2. 36 mm) slag, but there were no absorption by the AOD (0 - 0. 5 mm) or AOD (2 - 8 mm) slag. The conclusion from this study is that AOD slag (0 - 0. 5 mm) can be used successfully in P remediation projects because it absorbs 96 % of the <b>orthophosphates.</b> The results are consistent with previous results from (Zuo et al., 2015) and (Renman et al., 2013) ...|$|R
30|$|Typically, {{during the}} deposition, a target should be rotated {{to achieve a}} stable {{ablation}} rate. As PLD is usually carried out at high substrate temperatures, a thin oxide layer might be formed on the substrate surface prior to the deposition of calcium <b>orthophosphates</b> and, thereby, it influences its adherence to the substrate (Nelea et al. 2000). The deposited coatings, layers and films frequently consist of several calcium <b>orthophosphates</b> (often with admixtures of other substances, such as CaO, calcium pyrophosphates, etc.) and might contain both amorphous and crystalline phases (Cleries et al. 2000 a; Koch et al. 1990). Biphasic formulations, such as HA[*]+[*]TTCP (Kim et al. 2005 b), might be deposited as well. Interestingly, TTCP in the coatings was not formed by partial conversion of previously deposited HA. Instead, it was produced by nucleation and growth of TTCP itself from the ablation products of the HA target or by accretion of TTCP grains formed during ablation (Kim et al. 2005 b). Furthermore, the PLD-deposited coatings, films and layers might consist of calcium <b>orthophosphates</b> with different morphologies (e.g., granular and columnar), which have different resistance values to delamination (Cleries et al. 2000 a). More to the point, various types of oriented textures might be created as well (Kim et al. 2005 a, 2007 a, 2010). A modification known as ‘transmission laser coating’ has been introduced (Cheng and Ye 2010).|$|R
2500|$|At an {{oversight}} {{hearing before the}} House Committee on Government Reform in early March 2004, Marc Edwards testified that his studies showed the change from chlorine to chloramine {{was the cause of}} the elevated lead levels. [...] He stated that the chloramine-treated water was leaching lead not only from the old lead lines, but also from brass fixtures in homes. [...] Brass is made with lead; even brass classified as [...] "lead free" [...] under the Safe Drinking Water Act can contain up to eight percent lead. [...] Edwards said that this could be the cause of the high lead levels in areas where WASA did not use lead lines. [...] He also cautioned that replacing lead service lines with copper could make the problem worse; newly installed copper lines could react with the chloramine {{in a way that would}} increase corrosion of the remaining lead lines in the system. The chief of the Washington Aqueduct disagreed, saying that tests taken after the chloramine treatment commenced didn't show any additional corrosiveness. He believed corrosion inhibitors, like <b>orthophosphate,</b> could be added to the water to prevent lead leaching. In the spring of 2004, a temporary switch from chloramine back to chlorine for annual pipe flushing caused a 25 to 30 percent drop in lead levels, lending credence to the chloramine theory. In one home that was tested by WASA before and after the switch, lead levels dropped tenfold.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMixed Conduction in Rare-Earth PhosphatesbyHannah Leung RayDoctor of Philosophy in Materials Science and EngineeringUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor Lutgard C. De Jonghe, ChairThe goal of {{this work}} is {{to gain a better}} {{fundamental}} understanding of mixed electronic and protonic conduction in rare earth phosphates. Specifically, the controlled introduction of a small amount of electronic conductivity is found to enhance the proton conductivity of the (La,Ce) <b>orthophosphates.</b> This discovery could change the way that materials for electrolyte applications are designed. Rare earth <b>orthophosphates</b> for the past 20 years have been investigated for their applications as intermediate temperature fuel cell electrolytes. They are known to conduct protons, electron-holes, and oxygen vacancies, under different conditions. The rare earth phosphates are tunable in many different ways. The materials can be aliovalently doped; their metal to phosphorous ratio can be varied; and using different synthesis methods can have a large effect on their conduction properties. In addition, the (La,Ce) <b>orthophosphates</b> are an ideal model system for investigating mixed conduction. Systematically varying the Ce content tunes the contribution of electronic component of the total conduction. In this work, the defect chemistry of the system is discussed; several synthesis methods for the rare earth phosphate compositions are carried out; different methods for identifying the dominant charge carriers are described; and the effect of increasing the Ce content upon the total conductivity in single atmospheres and in the fuel cell configuration is measured...|$|R
