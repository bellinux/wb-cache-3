Cato the Elder once advised cutting his rations in half to conserve wine for the workforce. Many types of drinks involving grapes and honey were consumed as well. Drinking <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomach</b> was regarded as boorish and a sure sign for alcoholism, the debilitating physical and psychological effects of which were known to the Romans. An accurate accusation of being an alcoholic was {{an effective way to}} discredit political rivals. Prominent Roman alcoholics included Marcus Antonius, and Cicero's own son Marcus (Cicero Minor). Even Cato the Younger was known to be a heavy drinker.|$|E

Pregabalin oral bioavailability {{is estimated to}} be {{greater than or equal to}} 90% and is independent of dose. The rate of pregabalin absorption is decreased when given with food resulting in a decrease in Cmax by approximately 25 to 30% and a delay in Tmax (time to reach Cmax) to approximately 3 hours. Administration with food, however, has no clinically significant effect on the extent of absorption.|$|E

25|$|Azithromycin is an acid-stable antibiotic, {{so it can}} {{be taken}} orally with no need of {{protection}} from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed, but absorption is greater <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomach.</b> Time to peak concentration (Tmax) in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to its high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma due to ion trapping and its high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days.|$|E

25|$|Lactase enzymes {{similar to}} those {{produced}} in the small intestines of humans are produced industrially by fungi of the genus Aspergillus. The enzyme, β-galactosidase, is available in tablet form {{in a variety of}} doses, in many countries without a prescription. It functions well only in high-acid environments, such as that found in the human gut due to the addition of gastric juices from the stomach. Unfortunately, too much acid can denature it, so it should not be taken <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomach.</b> Also, the enzyme is ineffective if it does not reach the small intestine by the time the problematic food does. Lactose-sensitive individuals can experiment with both timing and dosage to fit their particular needs.|$|E
25|$|Relatively {{large doses}} of ascorbic acid may cause indigestion, {{particularly}} when taken <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomach.</b> However, taking vitamin C {{in the form}} of sodium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate may minimize this effect. When taken in large doses, ascorbic acid causes diarrhea in healthy subjects. In one trial in 1936, doses of up to 6grams of ascorbic acid were given to 29 infants, 93 children of preschool and school age, and 20 adults for more than 1400 days. With the higher doses, toxic manifestations were observed in five adults and four infants. The signs and symptoms in adults were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, flushing of the face, headache, fatigue and disturbed sleep. The main toxic reactions in the infants were skin rashes.|$|E
25|$|Anterograde amnesia {{can also}} be caused by alcohol intoxication, a {{phenomenon}} commonly known as a blackout. Studies show rapid rises in blood alcohol concentration over {{a short period of}} time severely impair or in some cases completely block the brain's ability to transfer short-term memories created during the period of intoxication to long-term memory for storage and later retrieval. Such rapid rises are caused by drinking large amounts of alcohol in short periods of time, especially <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomach,</b> as the dilution of alcohol by food slows the absorption of alcohol. Alcohol-related anterograde amnesia is directly related to the rate of consumption of alcohol (and is often associated with binge drinking), and not just the total amount of alcohol consumed in a drinking episode. Test subjects have been found not to experience amnesia when drinking slowly, despite being heavily intoxicated by the end of the experiment. When alcohol is consumed at a rapid rate, the point at which most healthy people's long-term memory creation starts to fail usually occurs at approximately 0.20% BAC, but can be reached as low as 0.14% BAC for inexperienced drinkers. The exact duration of these blackout periods is hard to determine, because most people fall asleep before they end. Upon reaching sobriety, usually after waking, long-term memory creation is completely restored.|$|E

2500|$|The other {{complaint}} {{is that the}} medicines must be taken <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomach</b> to facilitate absorption. [...] This can be difficult for patients to follow (for example, shift workers who take their meals at irregular times) and may mean the patient waking up an hour earlier than usual everyday just to take medication. [...] The rules are actually less stringent than many physicians and pharmacists realise: the issue is that the absorption of RMP is reduced if taken with fat, but is unaffected by carbohydrate, protein, or antacids. [...] So the patient can in fact have his or her medication with food {{as long as the}} meal does not contain fat or oils (e.g., a cup of black coffee or toast with jam and no butter). Taking the medicines with food also helps ease the nausea that many patients feel when taking the medicines <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomach.</b> [...] The effect of food on the absorption of INH is not clear: two studies have shown reduced absorption with food but one study showed no difference. There is a small effect of food on the absorption of PZA and of EMB that is probably not clinically important.|$|E
5000|$|Cannon and Washburn (1912) {{proposed}} that eating begins {{when we have}} <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomach.</b> They suggested that the walls of <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomach</b> rub against each other to produce what are commonly called [...] "hunger pangs".

(The patients' stomachs had been removed because of cancer or large ulcers, and their esophagi had been attached directly to their small intestines). Although the patients ate small frequent meals because they had no stomachs to hold food, their reports of feelings of hunger and their total food intake were essentially normal.|$|R

Peak absorption generally occurs within an hour. [...] During the initial absorptive phase, the distribution of alcohol throughout the body is not uniform. Uniformity of distribution, called equilibrium, occurs just as absorption completes. In other words, {{some parts of the}} body will have a higher blood alcohol content (BAC) than others.

[...] Whatever the numerical definition used, heavy drinking or rapid consumption over {{a short period of}} time with the intention of becoming intoxicated is often implied when the term is used colloquially, since four or five drinks consumed over the course of a whole day and as an accompaniment to meals will not have the same effects as the same amount consumed over a couple of hours <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomach.</b>|$|E
