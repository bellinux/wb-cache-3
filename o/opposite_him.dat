5|$|In 1960, Morell {{appeared}} as Judge Brack in {{a production of}} Henrik Ibsen's play Hedda Gabler at the Oxford Playhouse.

They fell in love and flew in secret to Jamaica, where they were married, remaining together until his death.|$|E
5|$|After half an hour's play Lycett Green {{once again}} became {{convinced}} that Gordon-Cumming was cheating. He left the table and sent a note to his mother-in-law—still at the table—recounting his suspicions: she took no action. By the time the game was finished Mary Wilson, the two Lycett Greens and Stanley Wilson—all {{of whom had been}} watching Gordon-Cumming closely—were convinced that he had been cheating, although they differed in their versions of what they saw. Others saw nothing, including people sitting closer to him, such as the prince, Lady Coventry (sitting next to Gordon-Cumming) and Levett (sitting <b>opposite</b> <b>him).</b> Over the two nights' play Gordon-Cumming won a total of £225.|$|E
5|$|Joseph-François Dailly, {{the first}} actor {{to play the}} role of Passepartout in Around the World in Eighty Days, was cast as Valdemar; another cast member of Around the World, Augustin-Guillemet Alexandre, played <b>opposite</b> <b>him</b> as Tartelet. Paul-Félix Taillade, who had {{appeared}} in The Children of Captain Grant, was cast as Doctor Ox, and Marie Daubrun, a well-known féerie actress who was also the mistress and muse of Charles Baudelaire, played Eva. The production was directed by Paul Clèves (born Paul Collin), the director of the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin from 1879 to 1883. Oscar de Lagoanère, a prolific composer and music director, wrote the music for the play.|$|E

5|$|In April 2010, Justin Timberlake {{became the}} first {{to sign on to}} the project. He was soon {{followed}} by Mila Kunis when she landed the female lead <b>opposite</b> <b>him.</b> Approximately two months later, Variety magazine announced that an ensemble cast consisting of Emma Stone, Patricia Clarkson, Richard Jenkins, Woody Harrelson, Andy Samberg and Jenna Elfman were set to join them in the film. Three days after principal filming began, Bryan Greenberg completed the cast. The film features cameo appearances from Shaun White, Jason Segel, and Rashida Jones. Production locations were set up as early as July 13, and principal filmography commenced on July 20, 2010 in the Midtown Manhattan section of New York City. Filming continued in Central Park and other sections of New York City from July to early August before the production relocated to Los Angeles, California.|$|E

25|$|The {{two sisters}} {{appeared}} on Broadway together as chorines and their success resulted in contracts with Warner Brothers Studios. In 1926, following small parts in feature films, she {{was selected by}} John Barrymore to star <b>opposite</b> <b>him</b> in The Sea Beast, a loose adaptation of Herman Melville's Moby-Dick. Warner Bros. soon began starring her in her own vehicles. Meanwhile, she and Barrymore became romantically involved and married in 1928.|$|E
25|$|Nancy Olson's pairing with William Holden was {{considered}} a success, and she appeared <b>opposite</b> <b>him</b> in several films during the 1950s, although none of them repeated their earlier success. She went on to star in The Absent-Minded Professor (1961) and Son of Flubber (1963), {{in which she was}} paired with Fred MacMurray, but despite the films' popularity with movie-goers, her career stalled. Holden and Wilder also rejoined forces in 1978 for Fedora, another film critical of Hollywood.|$|E

25|$|She {{was able}} to work with quite a few notable actors during her career. Eames often worked with Groucho Marx, who would always ask her to play <b>opposite</b> <b>him</b> {{whenever}} he performed in Time for Elizabeth.

She was also featured with Kaye Ballard, Eddie Bracken, Tom Ewell, Virginia Mayo, Ian Keith, Robert Alda and Gloria DeHaven.|$|E
25|$|In 69 CE, the Year of the Four Emperors, Otho's {{troops at}} Bedriacum {{included}} 2000 gladiators. <b>Opposite</b> <b>him</b> on the field, Vitellius's army was swollen by levies of slaves, plebs and gladiators. In 167 AD, troop depletions by plague and desertion may have prompted Marcus Aurelius to draft gladiators {{at his own}} expense. During the Civil Wars {{that led to the}} Principate, Octavian (later Augustus) acquired the personal gladiator troop of his erstwhile opponent, Mark Antony. They had served their late master with exemplary loyalty but thereafter, they disappear from the record.|$|E
25|$|After being omitted for the Twenty20 International against Australia and the 2007 World Cup, Cook {{found himself}} {{once again in}} favour for the home series against West Indies. Starting at Lord's, Cook found himself among four centurions in the opening innings with Collingwood <b>opposite</b> <b>him</b> once again, being one of only five Englishmen to hit as many centuries in 15 Tests and {{recorded}} another half century in the following innings to win his first Man of The Match award. After another half century in the second Test, Cook recorded another half century/century combination in the two innings at Old Trafford, his first innings sixty equating to the team's win margin. Cook was selected for his first Twenty20 International against the West Indies, in a losing effort where he scored 15 runs from 16 balls. This {{was followed by a}} disappointing one-day series for Cook, and England, who averaged 22 in 3 matches.|$|E

25|$|The rise of Sămănătorism was {{hotly contested}} by {{cosmopolitan}} or decadent trends, which {{were inspired by}} French-imported Symbolism and set the ground for avant-garde and modernist literature. The magazine found one of its main rivals in poet and theorist Alexandru Macedonski, recognized as the doyen of the Romanian Symbolist school and an enemy of traditionalist literature even before the year 1900, who put out the magazine Literatorul. The controversy {{was taken to the}} public sphere: a regular of the Kübler Coffeehouse, Macedonski is reported to have publicly mocked the Sămănătorists who had reserved the table <b>opposite</b> <b>him.</b> By 1908, criticism of traditionalist currents was taking the forefront in the activities of other Symbolist figures: the rebellious poet Ion Minulescu and the professional critic Ovid Densusianu, who openly suggested a literature based on urban models. As early as 1905, Densusianu had begun a polemic with Sămănătorul and the Poporanists by means of his own publication, Vieața Nouă, accusing his adversaries of hopelessly trying to cut Romania from the worldwide context and from progress itself.|$|E
25|$|Reding {{assaulted}} Mengibar anew on July 13 {{and drove}} Ligier-Belair {{from the village}} after a hard fight; at the appearance of Vedel's division, however, the Spanish column quietly drew back and French infantry reclaimed the town. The next day Coupigny tested the grounds at Villa Nueva and engaged the French piquets <b>opposite</b> <b>him</b> in a sharp skirmish. Castaños reached the heights at Arjonilla on July 15 and, setting up a battery on a ridge overlooking Andújar, opened fire on Dupont. At the same time, 1,600–4,000 skirmishers and irregulars under Colonel De la Cruz forded the river near Marmolejo and attacked towards Dupont's rear, but were handily repulsed by a French battalion and dispersed into the hills. Alarmed by this show of force, Dupont called on Vedel to release a battalion or even a brigade to his assistance, and Vedel, judging that Mengibar was not seriously threatened, {{set out in the}} night with his entire division. The arrival of Vedel with this sizeable force {{put an end to the}} threat at Andújar but gravely imperilled the French right wing (Mengibar—Bailén—La Carolina), leaving Ligier-Belair seriously denuded of troops in his fight against Reding.|$|E
25|$|The {{other side}} of Christmas, England went to India in March and after Trescothick absented himself owing to {{stress-related}} illness, Strauss found himself opening England's batting with 21-year-old debutante Alastair Cook. Cook repeated Strauss' debut theatrics, scoring a half and full century, overshadowing Strauss's 28 and 46 in the drawn match. Without Cook <b>opposite</b> <b>him</b> in the third Test, Strauss shone once again with 128 in a winning effort to level the series. In the following One Day matches England would have been lucky to manage a draw, suffering four straight losses under replacement captain Andrew Flintoff since Vaughan's knee-injury had prevented him from touring. Strauss's only double digit score was 61 in the second match but with Flintoff requiring a break from deputising, Strauss was handed the captaincy for the fifth match which ultimately was abandoned, leading to crowd violence in Guwahati. With Flintoff remaining the twelfth man for the following ODI, Strauss guided England to victory after putting India to bat, with a hundred partnership with Ian Bell totalling 74 before cramp forced him to retire. The emphatic, eight over victory was to be England's only One Day success on the tour as the final match saw India chase the runs victoriously with only five balls remaining with Strauss offering only 25.|$|E

25|$|Between 1976 and 1978, Khanna {{acted in}} five box office hits and in nine films {{that were not}} commercially successful. Seven of the {{unsuccessful}} films were critically acclaimed and have achieved strong cult status over the years among the viewers; these films included Mehbooba, Bundal Baaz, Tyaag, Palkon Ki Chhaon Mein, Naukri, Chakravyuha and Janta Hawaldar, which were directed by Shakti Samanta, Shammi Kapoor, Din Dayal Sharma, Meraj, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Basu Chatterjee and Mehmood Ali, respectively. Khanna persuaded Samanta to cast his sister-in-law Simple Kapadia <b>opposite</b> <b>him</b> in Anurodh. Films starring Rajesh Khanna and directed by Shakti Samanta tended to be commercially successful, but Mehbooba was an exception. The change from romantic and social movies to action oriented multi-starrers caused some decline of Khanna's career in terms of box office ratings. The declaration of emergency in India had angered the masses and this helped films having the lead character revolting against corruption to become successes. Actor Joy Mukherjee made Chhailla Babu, a suspense thriller in 1977, which became the only successful film of his as a director, and the unexpected success of Chhailla Babu gave a boost to the career of Khanna. However, Khanna continued basically in solo-hero socialy sober household meaningful films during this era and played a variety of characters in films of various genres. During this phase too he had box office hits like Maha Chor, Chhailla Babu, Anurodh, Karm, Tinku and Bhola Bhala.|$|E
25|$|Graham {{is seated}} {{to the right}} of the picture, on the left of the table that divides the picture. He is seen in full length, facing {{forwards}} though looking to the side, while smoking a long pipe. Standing to Graham's right, his lower half obscured by the table cloth, a man holds a sheet of music and is in the act of singing. The third member of the dining party is seated on the left of the painting, and like Graham is visible in full length. Ronald Paulson identifies them as the ship's clerk and chaplain. The music the men are listening or singing along to is provided by a black manservant, standing on the right of the painting and playing a pipe and tabor. A steward stands <b>opposite</b> <b>him</b> on the left of the painting, framing the composition. The steward holds a plate of roast duck, but looks out of the painting towards the viewer with a smile, while gravy drips from the plate down the back of the chaplain's coat. The remaining members of the portrait are two dogs. One is Graham's own, sitting at the chaplain's feet and apparently joining in the singing. The other, sat on his haunches on a chair on the right of the painting, is Hogarth's own pug, Trump. Trump, his tongue lolling out and wearing Graham's wig, holds a scroll and appears to read from his own sheet of music, balanced against a wine glass in front of him.|$|E
