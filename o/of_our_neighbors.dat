500|$|The Senate {{vetoed the}} text {{submitted}} by the Congress. The veto was proposed by the People's Party, which held {{the majority of the}} seats, and by the Democratic Union of Catalonia, and was approved by 131 [...] "yes" [...] and 119 [...] "no" [...] votes and 2 abstentions. As a result, the text was sent back to the Congress. On 30 June 2005, it was approved by Congress, which, in accordance with the constitutional provisions, overrode the Senate veto. This was achieved with 187 [...] "yes" [...] votes (including a member of the People's Party, Celia Villalobos), 147 [...] "no" [...] votes, and four abstentions. The veto override implied its approval as law. The vote was held after Zapatero unexpectedly took the floor of Parliament to speak in its support, saying We are expanding the opportunities for happiness <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>neighbors,</b> our colleagues, our friends and our relatives. At the same time, we are building a more decent society. Mariano Rajoy, the leader of the opposition People's Party, was denied the opportunity to address Parliament after Zapatero's appearance, and accused Zapatero of dividing Spanish society.|$|E

Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman called the shootings [...] "a cruel act" [...] and also praised the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department for [...] "dedicating their lives to protecting all of us in our community". Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval released {{a statement}}, saying that he was saddened by the murders and called the shootings [...] "an act of senseless violence". CiCi's Pizza and Walmart also gave their condolences to the victims, with the latter also stating that it would cooperate with police during the investigation.|$|E
2500|$|Later that day, Bethmann Hollweg sent {{a message}} to the German {{ambassador}} to Vienna increasing pressure to accept the halt-in-Belgrade proposal, saying that: [...] "If Vienna... refuses... to give way at all, it will hardly be possible to place the blame on Russia for the outbreak of the European conflagration. H.M. has, on the request of the Tsar, undertaken to intervene in Vienna because he could not refuse without awakening an irrefutable suspicion that we wanted war... If these efforts of Britain's meet with success, while Vienna refuses everything, Vienna will prove that it is set on having a war, into which we are dragged, while Russia remains free of guilt. This puts us in a quite impossible position in the eyes of our own people. We can therefore only urgently recommend Vienna to accept Grey's proposal, which safeguards its position in every way." [...] Bethmann Hollweg could not go to war in support of Austrian intransigence under such circumstances. But shortly afterwards, [...] "as soon as news of Russia's general mobilization began to arrive in Berlin" [...] the Chancellor instructed the ambassador in Vienna [...] "that all mediation attempts be stopped", and the directive be suspended. Fritz Fischer and some other scholars have maintained the alternative view that Prince Henry's assurances that King George had promised him that Britain would remain neutral accounted for the change. Fischer notes the telegram reporting these [...] "vague" [...] assurances arrived 12 minutes before the dispatch of the suspending telegram and that Bethmann Hollweg himself justified the cancellation that way, while acknowledging that before then Bethmann Hollweg had already prepared, but not yet sent, a telegram to Vienna explaining that he had [...] "cancelled execution of instructions in No. 200, because the General Staff has just informed me that military measures <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>neighbors,</b> especially in the east, compel speedy decision if we are not to be taken by surprise".|$|E
