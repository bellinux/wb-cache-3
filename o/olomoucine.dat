50|$|The {{implications}} of gliosis in various neuropathologies and injury conditions {{has led to}} the investigation of various therapeutic routes which would regulate specific aspects of gliosis in order to improve clinical outcomes for both CNS trauma and a wide range of neurological disorders. Because gliosis is a dynamic process which involves a spectrum of changes depending on the type and severity of the initial insult, to date, no single molecular target has been identified which could improve healing in all injury contexts. Rather, therapeutic strategies for minimizing the contribution of astrogliosis to CNS pathologies must be designed to target specific molecular pathways and responses. One promising therapeutic mechanism is the use of β-lactam antibiotics to enhance the glutamate uptake of astrocytes in order to reduce excitotoxicity and provide neuroprotection in models of stroke and ALS. Other proposed targets related to astrogliosis include manipulating AQP4 channels, diminishing the action of NF-kB, or regulating the STAT3 pathway {{in order to reduce the}} inflammatory effects of reactive astrocytes. Astrogliosis may also be attenuated by inhibiting the microgliosis response. One notable microglial activation inhibitor is minocycline, which is a known suppressor of astrogliosis. The cell cycle inhibitor <b>olomoucine</b> also has been shown to suppress both microglial and astroglial proliferation as well as glial scar formation. Future directions for identifying novel therapeutic strategies must carefully account for the complex array of factors and signaling mechanisms driving the gliosis response, particularly in different stages after damage and in different lesion conditions.|$|E

Induction of up to 50 and 80 %, respectively, of maximal swelling induced by high calcium was obtained at 1 mM concentrations, which also promoted a 17 -fold increase in the release of cytochrome c.

40|$|AbstractBackground: The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are {{important}} signaling molecules that participate in diverse cellular events and are potential targets for intervention in inflammation, cancer, and other diseases. The MAP kinase p 38 {{is responsive to}} environmental stresses and {{is involved in the}} production of cytokines during inflammation. In contrast, the activation of the MAP kinase ERK 2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 2) leads to cellular differentiation or proliferation. The anti-inflammatory agent pyridinylimidazole and its analogs (SB [SmithKline Beecham] compounds) are highly potent and selective inhibitors of p 38, but not of the closely-related ERK 2, or other serine/threonine kinases. Although these compounds are known to bind to the ATP-binding site, the origin of the inhibitory specificity toward p 38 is not clear. Results: We report the structural basis for the exceptional selectivity of these SB compounds for p 38 over ERK 2, as determined by comparative crystallography. In addition, structural data on the origin of <b>olomoucine</b> (a better inhibitor of ERK 2) selectivity are presented. The crystal structures of four SB compounds in complex with p 38 and of one SB compound and <b>olomoucine</b> in complex with ERK 2 are presented here.

Repeated infusions of the Cdk 5 inhibitor roscovitine into the NAc before cocaine injections augmented both the development and expression of cocaine sensitization without having any intrinsic stimulant actions of its own. Additionally, repeated intra-NAc infusions of roscovitine to saline-injected rats enhanced locomotor responses to a subsequent cocaine challenge. Similar effects were found after infusions of another Cdk 5 inhibitor, <b>olomoucine,</b> but not its inactive congener, iso-olomoucine. Repeated inhibition of Cdk 5 within the NAc also robustly enhanced the incentive-motivational effects of cocaine, similar {{to the effect of}} prior repeated cocaine exposure. The enhanced responding with conditioned reinforcement induced by cocaine persisted at least 2 weeks after the final roscovitine infusion. NAc infusions of <b>olomoucine</b> also produced acute and enduring increases in “breakpoints” achieved on a progressive ratio schedule for cocaine reinforcement. These results demonstrate profound and persistent effects of NAc Cdk 5 inhibition on locomotor sensitization and incentive-motivational processes and provide direct evidence for a role for striatal Cdk 5 -induced alterations in the brain's long-term adaptations to cocaine...|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{small cell}} lung cancer (SCLC) has a dismal prognosis. Modulation of the {{camptothecin}} topotecan, approved for second-line therapy, may improve response. Our recent finding of synergistic enhancement of the cytotoxic activity of camptothecin (CPT) by cyclin-dependent kinase 4 inhibitors is extended here to {{a panel of}} camptothecin analogs comprising 10 -hydroxy-CPT (HOCPT), topotecan (TPT; 9 -[(dimethylamino) -methyl]- 10 -hydroxy-CPT), 9 -amino-CPT (9 AC), 9 -nitrocamptothecin (rubitecan), SN 38 (7 -ethyl- 10 -hydroxycamptothecin) and 10 -hydroxy- 9 -nitrocamptothecin (CPT 109) in combination with PD 0332991, CDK 4 I, roscovitine and <b>olomoucine.</b> SCLC cell lines employed are chemoresistant NCI-H 417 and DMS 153 and the chemosensitive SCLC 26 A line established at our institution. The CPT analogs exhibiting highest cytotoxicity towards the three SCLC lines tested were SN 38 and 9 AC, followed by rubitecan, HOCPT, TPT and CPT 109. NCI-H 417 and DMS 153 revealed an approximately 25 -fold and 7 -fold higher resistance compared to the chemosensitive SCLC 26 A cell line. Whereas the CDK 4 / 6 inhibitor PD 0332991 proved less effective to chemosensitize SCLC cells to CPT analogs, the CDK inhibitors CDK 4 I, roscovitine and <b>olomoucine</b> gave comparable chemosensitization effects in combination with 9 AC, SN 38, rubitecan {{and to a lesser}} extent with TPT and CPT 109, not directly related with topoisomerase mRNA expression. In conclusion, small chemical modifications of the parent CPT structure result in differing cytotoxicities and chemomodulatory effects in combination with CDKIs of the resulting analogs...|$|E
40|$|We {{show here}} that an active Cdk 5 -p 35 kinase {{is present in}} Golgi membranes, where it {{associates}} with a detergent-insoluble fraction containing actin. In addition, Cdk 5 -p 35 -dependent phosphorylation of α-PAK immunoreactive protein species was detected in Golgi membranes, {{as well as an}} interaction with the small GTPase, Cdc 42. Moreover, antisense oligonucleotide suppression of Cdk 5 or p 35 in young cultured neurons, as well as inhibition of Cdk 5 activity with <b>olomoucine,</b> blocks the formation of membrane vesicles from the Golgi apparatus. Taken together, these results show a novel subcellular localization of this kinase and suggest a role for Cdk 5 -p 35 in membrane traffic during neuronal process outgrowth...|$|E
40|$|Extended - stage {{small cell}} lung cancer (SCLC) {{responds}} to platinum/vepeside-based first-line chemotherapy but relapses rapidly as drug-resistant tumor. Topotecan (TPT) {{is the single}} chemotherapeutic agent approved for second-line treatment of SCLC. However, the response to TPT is short-lived and novel treatment modalities need to be developed. Sequential treatment of cytotoxic drugs and inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) showed promising preclinical anticancer activity and, in the present work, combinations of TPT with CDK inhibitors <b>olomoucine,</b> roscovitine and CDK 4 I are shown to exhibit synergistic cytotoxic activity against SCLC cell lines. Highest activity was found against TPT-resistant NCI-H 417 and DMS 153 cell lines and moderate chemosensitizing effects against a primary SCLC cell line and sensitive GLC 19 cells at levels of CDK inhibitors which exerted low toxicity. A combination of 0. 6 μM TPT with 0. 6 μM roscovitine, exhibiting no significant cytotoxicity as single agents, reduced viability of the TPT-resistant NCI-H 417 line (IC 50 > 10 μM) by 50 %. In the TPT resistant cell lines <b>olomoucine</b> and roscovitine, targeting CDK 1, 2, 5, 7, were highly effective, whereas in the more sensitive cell lines CDK 4 I, inhibiting mainly CDK 4 / 6, showed activity. In NCI- 417 cells, preincubation with roscovitine for one day proved synergistic with TPT. Thus, in good accordance with previous findings, CDK inhibitors are able to convert SCLC cancer cells which are cell-cycle arrested by a blockade of topoisomerase I by TPT to apoptotic cells. Since nowadays several CDK inhibitors are at various phases of clinical testing their combination with TPT seems to constitute a promising approach to improve second-line chemotherapy in SCLC. </p...|$|E
40|$|Recently we {{reported}} that the pyridinylimidazole class of p 38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitors potently inhibited the facilitated transport of nucleosides and nucle-oside analogs in K 562 cells. These compounds competed with the binding of nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) to K 562 cells, consistent with inhibition of the NBMPR-sensitive equilibrative transporter (ENT 1). In this study we examined {{a large number of}} additional protein kinase inhibitors for their effects on nucleoside transport. We find that incubation of K 562 cells with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (AG 825, AG 1517, AG 1478, STI- 571), protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors (stauro-sporine, GF 109203 X, R 0 31 - 8220, arcyriarubin A), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (roscovitine, <b>olomoucine,</b> indiru-bin- 3 -monoxime), or rapamycin resulted in a dose...|$|E
40|$|Many {{dramatic}} {{alterations in}} various cellular processes during the cell cycle {{are known to}} involve ion channels. In ascidian embryos and Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes, for example, the activity of inwardly rectifying Cl− channels is enhanced during the M phase of the cell cycle, but the mechanism underlying this change remains to be established. We show here that the volume-sensitive Cl− channel, ClC- 2 is regulated by the M-phase-specific cyclin-dependent kinase, p 34 cdc 2 /cyclin B. ClC- 2 channels were phosphorylated by p 34 cdc 2 /cyclin B in both in vitro and cell-free phosphorylation assays. ClC- 2 phosphorylation was inhibited by <b>olomoucine</b> and abolished by a 632 Ser-to-Ala (S 632 A) mutation in the C-terminus, indicating that 632 Ser is a target of phosphorylation by p 34 cdc 2 /cyclin B. Injection of activated p 34 cdc 2 /cyclin B attenuated the ClC- 2 currents but not the S 632 A mutant channel currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes. ClC- 2 currents attenuated by p 34 cdc 2 /cyclin B were increased by application of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, <b>olomoucine</b> (100 μm), an effect that was inhibited by calyculin A (5 nm) but not by okadaic acid (5 nm). A yeast two-hybrid system revealed a direct interaction between the ClC- 2 C-terminus and protein phosphatase 1. These {{data suggest that the}} ClC- 2 channel is also counter-regulated by protein phosphatase 1. In addition, p 34 cdc 2 /cyclin B decreased the magnitude of ClC- 2 channel activation caused by cell swelling. As the activities of both p 34 cdc 2 /cyclin B and protein phosphatase 1 vary during the cell cycle, as does cell volume, the ClC- 2 channel could be regulated physiologically by these factors...|$|E
40|$|The amyloid-? (A?) peptide {{has been}} implicated in the {{pathology}} of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using an antisense peptide approach a novel interaction between A? and the human cdc 2 kinase was identified. The A? 1 - 42, 1 - 40 and 25 - 35 peptides were shown to be substrates for the cdc 2 kinase and phosphorylated on the Serine 26 residue. Phosphorylated A? (pSA?) was found in extracts from NT- 2 neurons and AD brain. In NT- 2 neurons the levels of pSA? were increased {{in the presence of}} exogenous A? and this increase was prevented by a cdc 2 protein kinase inhibitor, <b>olomoucine,</b> that also prevented A? cytotoxicity.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that G 1 /S cell cycle blockers and inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) prevent the death of nerve growth factor (NGF) -deprived PC 12 cells and sympathetic neurons, suggesting that proteins normally involved in the cell cycle may also serve to regulate neuronal apoptosis. Past findings additionally demonstrate that DNAdamaging agents, such as the DNA topoisomerase (topo-I) inhibitor camptothecin, also induce neuronal apoptosis. In the present study, we show that camptothecin-induced apoptosis of PC 12 cells, sympathetic neurons, and cerebral cortical neurons is suppressed by the G 1 /S blockers deferoxamine and mimosine, {{as well as by the}} CDK-inhibitors flavopiridol and <b>olomoucine.</b> In each case, the IC 50 values were similar to those reported for inhibition of death induced by NGF-deprivation.
