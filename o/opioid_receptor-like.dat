50|$|The nociceptin {{receptor}} (NOP), {{also known}} as the nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) receptor or kappa-type 3 opioid receptor, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the OPRL1 (<b>opioid</b> <b>receptor-like</b> 1) gene. The nociceptin receptor {{is a member of the}} opioid subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors whose natural ligand is the 17 amino acid neuropeptide known as nociceptin (N/OFQ).

40|$|Non-dopamine (putative GABAergic) neurons in the ventral tegmental {{area are}} in a {{position}} to influence mesolimbic functions by their inhibitory terminals that impinge locally on dopamine neurons and via their GABAergic efferents that innervate mesolimbic structures. In the present study we investigated responses of non-dopamine and dopamine neurons, recorded intracellularly in the rat midbrain slice, to orphanin FQ/nociceptin, the endogenous ligand for <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor-like</b> orphan receptors. When recording in either non-dopamine or dopamine neurons, orphanin FQ/nociceptin reduced the frequency of spike firing and caused membrane hyperpolarization under current-clamp, or produced outward current under voltage-clamp. Such responses were concentration-dependent and reversed at − 108 mV and − 102 mV in non-dopamine and dopamine neurons, respectively. Hyperpolarizations to orphanin FQ/nociceptin were not altered by tetrodotoxin or the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, but were reduced by the <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor-like</b> orphan receptor antagonist [Phe 11 φCH 2 -NH) Gly 2]NC(1 – 13) NH 2 (1 μM). In dopamine neurons, orphanin FQ/nociceptin reduced the frequency of bicuculline- and tetrodotoxin-sensitive spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, and reduced the amplitude of stimulus-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. Taken together, the above data provide evidence that both non-dopamine and dopamine neurons are important substrates for orphanin FQ/nociceptin within the {{ventral tegmental area}}. Simultaneous inhibition of both non-dopamine and dopamine pathways by orphanin FQ/nociceptin may account for its influences on various ventral tegmental area-related functions...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{evolution of}} the opioid receptor family has been studied by isolating cDNAs that encode six distinct <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor-like</b> proteins from a lower vertebrate, the teleost fish Catostomus commersoni. One of these, which has been obtained in full-length form, encodes a 383 -amino acid protein that exhibits greatest sequence similarity to mammalian μ-opioid receptors; the corresponding gene is expressed predominantly in brain and pituitary. Transfection of the teleost cDNA into HEK 293 cells resulted in {{the appearance of a}} receptor having high affinity for the μ-selective agonist [D-Ala 2, MePhe 4 -Gly-ol 5] enkephalin (DAMGO) (K(d) = 0. 63 ± 0. 15 nM) and for the nonselective antagonist naloxone (K(d) = 3. 1 ± 1. 3 nM). The receptor had negligible affinity for U 50488 and [D-Pen 2, D-Pen 5] enkephalin (DP-DPE), which are κ- and δ-opioid receptor selective agonists, respectively. Stimulation of transfected cells with 1 μM DAMGO lowered forskolin-induced cAMP levels, an effect that could be reversed by naloxone. Experiments in Xenopus oocytes have demonstrated that the fish opioid receptor can, in an agonist-dependent fashion, activate a coexpressed mouse G-protein-gated inward-rectifying potassium channel (GIRK 1). The identification of six distinct fish <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor-like</b> proteins suggests that additional mammalian opioid receptors remain to be identified at the molecular level. Furthermore, our data indicate that the μ-opioid receptor arose very early in evolution, perhaps before the appearance of vertebrates, and that the pharmacological and functional properties of this receptor have been conserved over a period of ≃ 400 million years implying that it fulfills an important physiological role...|$|E

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that nociceptin, the {{endogenous}} ligand for the <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor-like</b> receptor (ORL 1), modulates central control of cardiovascular activity. The nucleus ambiguus, an area containing cardiac parasympathetic neurons, contains both ORL 1 receptors and neurons that contain nociceptin itself. Although previous work has shown that nociceptin acts to increase parasympathetic outflow to the heart, the mechanisms by which this is achieved are unknown. In the present study, the effects of nociceptin on spontaneous -aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) input to cardiac parasympathetic neurons (IPSCs) was examined. At 100 M, nociceptin inhibited both the fre-quency (35. 6 %) and the amplitude (49. 5 %) of spontaneous GABAergic IPSCs in cardiac vagal neurons. Nociceptin also caused a novel postsynaptic inhibition of the responses evoked by exogenous application of GABA. These results indicate that nociceptin acts both on neurons precedent to cardiovascular neurons to decrease the activity of GABAergic neurons that synapse upon cardiovascular neurons and directly, inhibiting the postsynaptic currents evoked by GABA. This inhibition by nociceptin would increase parasympathetic outflow to the heart, thus providing a possible mechanism for nociceptin-induced bradycardia. Nociceptin, a newly discovered endogenous peptide, is the ligand for the <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor-like</b> receptor (ORL 1) (Hender-son and McKnight, 1997; Meunier, 1997). Despite its selec-tive binding to this receptor, nociceptin shares a structural resemblance to classical endogenous opioid peptides and dis-plays actions in common with them, including modulation of pain (Henderson and McKnight, 1997; King et al., 1997) and cellular actions such as inhibition of synaptic transmission (Emmerson and Miller, 1999); regulation of neurotransmit-ter release including serotonin (Siniscalchi et al., 1999; Schlicker and Morari, 2000), noradrenaline (Schlicker an...|$|E
40|$|Nociceptin/orphanin FQ and nocistatin are two neuropeptides with {{opposing}} {{effects on}} spinal neurotransmission and nociception. Nociceptin/orphanin FQ selectively suppresses excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission, while nocistatin selectively interferes with glycinergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) -ergic transmission.

The ECAR response stimulated by N/OFQ was concentration-dependent and pertussis toxin-sensitive. Repeated exposures of the cells to N/OFQ caused desensitization of ORL 1. The ECAR response was recovered at the half-life of approximately 12 min after the initial challenge. Pretreatment with inhibitor of cAMP-dependent kinase did not affect desensitization of ORL 1.

However, Phe Phi noc elicited maximal effects lower than those induced by nociceptin, and when combined with nociceptin potently antagonized the responses to the natural agonist (K-i = 0. 9 nM).

In the present study, {{administration of}} NC exacerbated ibotenate-induced white-matter lesions while coadministration of ibotenate with either of two NC antagonists reduced excitotoxic white-matter lesions by up to 64 %. Neither ibotenate plus endomorphin I (a selective μ receptor agonist), nor ibotenate plus naloxone (a classical opioid receptor antagonist) modulated the excitotoxic lesion. Pretreatment with antisense oligonucleotides targeting the NC precursor peptide mRNA significantly reduced ibotenate-induced white-matter damage. Finally, high doses of fentanyl, which stimulates both classical μ opioid receptors and ORL 1, exacerbated excitotoxic white-matter lesion. This toxic effect was blocked by inhibiting ORL 1 but not classical opioid receptors. Together, these findings show that endogenous or exogenous stimulation of the ORL 1 receptor can be neurotoxic and that blocking NC signaling protects the white matter against excitotoxic challenge.

Here we describe the isolation and characterization of N/OFQ binding biostable RNA aptamers (Spiegelmers) using a mirror-image in vitro selection approach. Spiegelmers are l-enantiomeric oligonucleotide ligands that display high affinity and specificity to their targets and high resistance to enzymatic degradation compared to d-oligonucleotides. A representative Spiegelmer from the selections performed was size-minimized to two distinct sequences capable of high affinity binding to N/OFQ. The Spiegelmers were shown to antagonize binding of N/OFQ to the ORL 1 receptor in a binding-competition assay. The calculated IC 50 values for the Spiegelmers NOX 2149 and NOX 2137 a/b were 110 nM and 330 nM, respectively. The competitive antagonistic properties of these Spiegelmers were further demonstrated by their effective and specific inhibition of G-protein activation in two additional models. The Spiegelmers antagonized the N/OFQ-induced GTPγS incorporation into cell membranes of a CHO-K 1 cell line expressing the human ORL 1 receptor.

An up-regulation of ORL 1 expression was observed across all brain regions in delta-knockouts with cortical regions typically showing a 15 - 30 % increase in binding that was most marked in heterozygous mice. In contrast, ORL 1 receptor expression was down-regulated in virtually all brain structures in heterozygous kappa-knockouts although the magnitude of this change was not as great as for the delta-knockouts. No significant alterations in ORL 1 receptor expression were observed across brain regions in mu-receptor knockout mice and there were no qualitative differences in ORL 1 receptor expression in any groups. These data suggest there are interactions between the ORL 1 system and the classical opioid receptors and that the interactions are receptor-specific.

A clear understanding of the structural requirements for ligand selectivity by classical opioid receptors and identification of a common "opioid binding pocket" has not been achieved yet. At this juncture, the ORL 1 receptor system presents itself as a potential tool in the quest for elucidating critical elements directing ligand selectivity. The current paper is a compilation of several site-directed mutagenesis studies conducted on the ORL 1 receptor system.

Studies on {{the analysis of the}} precursor of Noc/OFQ, we identified another novel neuropeptide and named it “nocistatin”. Noc/OFQ is involved in a broad range of pharmacological actions in various tissues from the central nervous system to the periphery. We found that intrathecal administration of Noc/OFQ induced pain responses including touch-evoked pain (allodynia) and thermal hyperalgesia. While both the allodynia and the hyperalgesia evoked by Noc/OFQ were transmitted by capsaicin-sensitive primary afferent fibers and initially in the disinhibition of the inhibitory glycinergic response, the allodynia was mediated by glutamate through the N-methyl-D-asparateate receptor comprising the GluRε 1 subunit and the thermal hyperalgesia was mediated by substance P. Two bioactive peptides, Noc/OFQ and nocistatin exist the same precursor prepronociceptin/orphanin FQ. Simultaneous administration of nocistatin blocked the allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia induced by Noc/OFQ, and anti-nocistatin antibody decreased the threshold for the Noc/OFQ-induced allodynia. The carboxy-terminal hexapeptide of nocistatin (Glu-Gln-Lys-Gln-Leu-Gln), which is conserved in bovine, human and murine species, possesses the blocking activity. Nocistatin also attenuated the allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia evoked by prostaglandin E 2 and the inflammatory pain induced by formalin or carrageenan/kaolin, and reversed morphine tolerance and the Noc/OFQ-induced inhibition of morphine analgesia.

Rats were treated for 3 days with either saline or morphine (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, s. c.) followed, 15 and 75 [*]min later, by two intracerebroventricular injections of either artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) or OFQ/N. The dose of OFQ/N was doubled each day (7. 5, 15, 30 [*]nmol). On day 4, rats were tested on a hot plate apparatus before and 30, 60 and 90 [*]min after morphine administration. Repeated OFQ/N treatment did not affect basal nociceptive responses or morphine-induced antinociception. However, the same treatment significantly attenuated the development of morphine tolerance. Since learning and memory could {{contribute to the development of}} morphine tolerance, in subsequent studies, we examined the effect of OFQ/N administered in the CA 3 region of the hippocampus, where OFQ/N has been shown to block LTP and impair spatial memory. A greater attenuation of morphine tolerance with no alteration of baseline hot plate latency or morphine-induced antinociception was observed when OFQ/N was administered in this area of the rat brain. Taken together, our results demonstrate that OFQ/N may act in the hippocampus to attenuate morphine tolerance...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe ORL 1 (<b>Opioid</b> <b>Receptor-Like)</b> {{receptor}} is the G protein-coupled receptor whose {{amino acid}} sequence is closest to those of opioid receptors. Residues that are conserved in ORL 1 and {{the three types of}} opioid receptor, but also a residue, His in the sixth putative transmembrane (TM 6) helix, which is present in all opioid receptor types but absent in ORL 1, appear to {{play a key role in}} receptor recognition and/or activation. Here we have sought to create an opioid binding pocket in the non-opioid ORL 1 receptor by replacing residue Gln 280 in its TM 6 by the corresponding His residue of opioid receptors. The mutation affects neither the affinity of nociceptin - the natural ORL 1 agonist - for the receptor, nor the potency of nociceptin to inhibit adenylyl cyclase via ORL 1. In contrast, we find that a few opioid ligands, the agonists lofentanil, etorphine and dynorphin A, and especially the antagonists diprenorphine and nor-BNI, bind the mutant Q 280 H receptor with substantially (5 - to > 100 -fold) higher apparent affinity than they do the wild-type receptor. Moreover, lofentanil and etorphine no longer act as pure agonists, as they do at the native ORL 1 receptor, but are endowed with clear antagonist properties at the mutant receptor. The mutation Q 280 H, which increases affinity while decreasing intrinsic activity of opioids at ORL 1, emphasizes the importance of the His residue for opioid recognition and activation...|$|E
40|$|The <b>opioid</b> <b>{{receptor}}-like</b> 1 (NOP or ORL 1) receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor the endogenous ligand {{of which}} is the heptadecapeptide, nociceptin (Noc). NOP receptors are known to modulate pain processing at spinal, supraspinal, and peripheral levels. Previous work has demonstrated that NOP receptors inhibit N-type Ca 2 + channel currents in rat sympathetic stellate ganglion (SG) neurons via pertussis toxin (PTX) -sensitive Gαi/o subunits. However, the identification of the specific Gα subunit that mediates the Ca 2 + current modulation is unknown. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to examine coupling specificity of Noc-activated NOP receptors to N-type Ca 2 + channels in SG neurons. Small interference RNA (siRNA) transfection was employed to block the expression of PTX-sensitive Gα subunits. RT-PCR results showed that siRNA specifically decreased the expression of the intended Gα subunit. Evaluation of cell surface protein expression and Ca 2 + channel modulation were assessed by immunofluorescence staining and electrophysiological recordings, respectively. Furthermore, the presence of mRNA of the intended siRNA target Gα protein was examined by RT-PCR experiments. Fluorescence imaging showed that Gαi 1, Gαi 3, and Gαo were expressed in SG neurons. The transfection of Gαi 1 -specific siRNA resulted in a significant decrease in Noc-mediated Ca 2 + current inhibition, while silencing of either Gαi 3 or Gαo was without effect. Taken together, these results suggest that in SG neurons Gαi 1 subunits selectively couple NOP receptors to N-type Ca 2 + channels...|$|E
40|$|The {{coupling}} of <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor-like</b> (ORL 1) receptors to adenylyl cyclase {{has been}} investigated in specific layers of the rat main olfactory bulb. Membranes prepared from the olfactory nerve-glomerular layer (ON-G layer), external plexiform layer (EP layer) and granule cell layer (GR layer) displayed specific binding sites for [(3) H]-nociceptin/orphanin FQ ([(3) H]Noc/OFQ). In each layer, the presence of high-and low-affinity binding sites, with K(D) values in the picomolar and nanomolar range, respectively, was detected. The binding of [(3) H]Noc/OFQ was displaced by unlabelled Noc/OFQ, but not by opioid antagonists. In each layer, Noc/OFQ significantly stimulated [(35) S]GTPgammaS binding with nanomolar potencies. In ON-G layer, Noc/OFQ inhibited basal adenylyl cyclase activity and the enzyme stimulations by corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), Ca(2 +) /calmodulin (Ca(2 +) /CaM) and forskolin (FSK). In EP layer, Noc/OFQ inhibited Ca(2 +) /CaM-and FSK-stimulated enzyme activities. Conversely, in GR layer the peptide stimulated basal cyclase activity and potentiated the enzyme activation by CRH. The Noc/OFQ stimulation was counteracted by the GDP-bound form of the alpha subunit of transducin and was mimicked by transducin betagamma subunits. In the same tissue layer, Ca(2 +) /CaM-and FSK-stimulated enzyme activities were inhibited. Naloxone failed to antagonize all the actions of Noc/OFQ. Western blot and RT-PCR analysis revealed the expression of Ca(2 +) -insensitive and -sensitive adenylyl cyclases in the three layers. These results demonstrate that in rat main olfactory bulb ORL 1 receptors can differentially affect distinct forms of adenylyl cyclase in a layer specific manner...|$|E
40|$|Nociceptin (orphanin FQ), {{the newly}} {{discovered}} natural agonist of <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor-like</b> (ORL 1) receptor, is a neuropeptide that is endowed with pronociceptive activity in vivo. Nociceptin {{is derived from}} a larger precursor, prepronociceptin (PPNOC), whose human, mouse, and rat genes we have now isolated. The PPNOC gene is highly conserved in the three species and displays organizational features that are strikingly {{similar to those of}} the genes of preproenkephalin, preprodynorphin, and preproopiomelanocortin, the precursors to endogenous opioid peptides, suggesting the four genes belong to the same family-i. e. have a common evolutionary origin. The PPNOC gene encodes a single copy of nociceptin as well as of other peptides whose sequence is strictly conserved across murine and human species; hence it is likely to be neurophysiologically significant. Northern blot analysis shows that the PPNOC gene is predominantly transcribed in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and, albeit weakly, in the ovary, the sole peripheral organ expressing the gene. By using a radiation hybrid cell line panel, the PPNOC gene was mapped to the short arm of human chromosome 8 (8 p 21), between sequence-tagged site markers WI- 5833 and WI- 1172, in close proximity of the locus encoding the neurofilament light chain NEFL. Analysis of yeast artificial chromosome clones belonging to the WC 8. 4 contig covering the 8 p 21 region did not allow to detect the presence of the gene on these yeast artificial chromosomes, suggesting a gap in the coverage within this contig.

40|$|AIM: The heptadecapeptide nociceptin alias orphanin FQ is the {{endogenous}} agonist of <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor-like</b> 1 receptor. It {{is involved}} in modulation of pain and cognition. High blood level was reported in patients with acute and chronic pain, and in Wilson disease. An accidental observation led us to investigate nociceptin in hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: Plasma nociceptin level was measured by radioimmunoassay, aprotinin was used as protease inhibitor. Hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed by laboratory, ultrasound, other imaging, and confirmed by fine needle biopsy. Results were compared to healthy controls and patients with other chronic liver diseases. RESULTS: Although nociceptin levels were elevated in patients with Wilson disease (14. 0 +/- 2. 7 pg/mL, n = 26), primary biliary cirrhosis (12. 1 +/- 3. 2 pg/mL, n = 21) and liver cirrhosis (12. 8 +/- 4. 0 pg/mL, n = 15) compared to the healthy controls (9. 2 +/- 1. 8 pg/mL, n = 29, P < 0. 001 for each), in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma a ten-fold increase was found (105. 9 &PLUSMN; 14. 4 pg/mL, n = 29, P < 0. 0001). High plasma levels were found in each hepatocellular carcinoma patient including those with normal alpha fetoprotein and those with pain (104. 9 +/- 14. 9 pg/mL, n = 12) and without (107. 7 +/- 14. 5 pg/mL, n = 6). CONCLUSION: A very high nociceptin plasma level {{seems to be an}} indicator for hepatocellular carcinoma. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanism and clinical significance of this novel finding...|$|E

40|$|Orphanin FQ (OFQ) is the {{endogenous}} agonist of the <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor-like</b> receptor (ORL- 1). It and its precursor, prepro-OFQ, exhibit structural features {{suggestive of}} the opioid peptides. A cDNA encoding the OFQ precursor sequence in the rat recently has been cloned, and the authors recently generated a polyclonal antibody {{directed against the}} OFQ peptide. In the present study, the authors used in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to examine the distribution of OFQ peptide and mRNA in {{the central nervous system}} of the adult rat. OFQ immunoreactivity and prepro-OFQ mRNA expression correlated virtually in all brain areas studied. In the forebrain, OFQ peptide and mRNA were prominent in the neocortex endopiriform nucleus, claustrum, lateral septum, ventral forebrain, hypothalamus, mammillary bodies, central and medial nuclei of the amygdala, hippocampal formation, paratenial and reticular nuclei of the thalamus, medial habenula, and zona incerta. No OFQ was observed in the pineal or pituitary glands. In the brainstem, OFQ was prominent in the ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, nucleus of the posterior commissure, central gray, nucleus of Darkschewitsch, peripeduncular nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, tegmental nuclei, locus coeruleus, raphe complex, lateral parabrachial nucleus, inferior olivary complex, vestibular nuclear complex, prepositus hypoglossus, solitary nucleus, nucleus ambiguous, caudal spinal trigeminal nucleus, and reticular formation. In the spinal cord, OFQ was observed throughout the dorsal and ventral horns. The wide distribution of this peptide provides support for its role in a multitude of functions, including not only nociception but also motor and balance control, special sensory processing, and various autonomic and physiologic processes.

40|$|Nociceptin, {{also known}} as orphanin FQ, is an {{endogenous}} ligand for the orphan <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor-like</b> receptor 1 (ORL 1) and involves in various functions in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). On the other hand, nocistatin is recently isolated from the same precursor as nociceptin and blocks nociceptin-induced allodynia and hyperalgesia. Although ORL 1 receptors which display a high degree of sequence homology with classical opioid receptors are abundant in the hippocampus, little is known regarding their role in learning and memory. The present study was designed to investigate whether nociceptin/orphanin FQ and nocistatin could modulate impairment of learning and memory induced by scopolamine, a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist, using spontaneous alternation of Y-maze and step-down type passive avoidance tasks in mice. While nocistatin (0. 5 – 5. 0 [*]nmol mouse− 1, i. c. v.) administered 30 [*]min before spontaneous alternation performance or the training session of the passive avoidance task, had no effect on spontaneous alternation or passive avoidance behaviours, a lower per cent alternation and shorter median step-down latency in the retention test were obtained in nociceptin (1. 5 and/or 5. 0 [*]nmol mouse− 1, i. c. v.) -treated normal mice. Administration of nocistatin (1. 5 and/or 5. 0 [*]nmol mouse− 1, i. c. v.) 30 [*]min before spontaneous alternation performance or the training session of the passive avoidance task, attenuated the scopolamine-induced impairment of spontaneous alternation and passive avoidance behaviours. These results indicated that nocistatin, a new biologically active peptide, ameliorates impairments of spontaneous alternation and passive avoidance induced by scopolamine, and suggested that these peptides play opposite roles in learning and memory...|$|E
