5|$|The lithosphere, which rides {{atop the}} asthenosphere, {{is divided into}} a number of tectonic plates that are {{continuously}} being created and consumed at their opposite plate boundaries. <b>Oceanic</b> crust and tectonic plates are formed and move apart at mid-ocean ridges. Abyssal hills are formed by stretching of the <b>oceanic</b> lithosphere. Consumption or destruction of the <b>oceanic</b> lithosphere occurs at <b>oceanic</b> trenches (a type of convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary) by a process known as subduction. <b>Oceanic</b> trenches are found at places where the <b>oceanic</b> lithospheric slabs of two different plates meet, and the denser (older) slab begins to descend back into the mantle. At the consumption edge of the plate (the <b>oceanic</b> trench), the <b>oceanic</b> lithosphere has thermally contracted to become quite dense, and it sinks under its own weight in the process of subduction. The subduction process consumes older <b>oceanic</b> lithosphere, so <b>oceanic</b> crust is seldom more than 200 million years old. The overall process of repeated cycles of creation and destruction of <b>oceanic</b> crust is known as the Supercontinent cycle, first proposed by Canadian geophysicist and geologist John Tuzo Wilson.|$|E
5|$|New <b>oceanic</b> crust, {{closest to}} the mid-oceanic ridges, is mostly basalt at shallow levels and has a rugged topography. The {{roughness}} of this topography {{is a function of}} the rate at which the mid-ocean ridge is spreading (the spreading rate). Magnitudes of spreading rates vary quite significantly. Typical values for fast-spreading ridges are greater than 100mm/yr, while slow-spreading ridges are typically less than 20mm/yr. Studies have shown that the slower the spreading rate, the rougher the new <b>oceanic</b> crust will be, and vice versa. It is thought this phenomenon is due to faulting at the mid-ocean ridge when the new <b>oceanic</b> crust was formed. These faults pervading the <b>oceanic</b> crust, along with their bounding abyssal hills, are the most common tectonic and topographic features on the surface of the Earth. The process of seafloor spreading helps to explain the concept of continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|<b>Oceanic</b> crust, {{which forms}} {{the bedrock of}} abyssal plains, is {{continuously}} being created at mid-ocean ridges (a type of divergent boundary) by {{a process known as}} decompression melting. Plume-related decompression melting of solid mantle is responsible for creating ocean islands like the Hawaiian islands, as well as the ocean crust at mid-ocean ridges. This phenomenon is also the most common explanation for flood basalts and <b>oceanic</b> plateaus (two types of large igneous provinces). Decompression melting occurs when the upper mantle is partially melted into magma as it moves upwards under mid-ocean ridges. This upwelling magma then cools and solidifies by conduction and convection of heat to form new <b>oceanic</b> crust. Accretion occurs as mantle is added to the growing edges of a tectonic plate, usually associated with seafloor spreading. The age of <b>oceanic</b> crust is therefore a function of distance from the mid-ocean ridge. The youngest <b>oceanic</b> crust is at the mid-ocean ridges, and it becomes progressively older, cooler and denser as it migrates outwards from the mid-ocean ridges as part of the process called mantle convection.|$|E

5|$|The <b>oceanic</b> whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus), {{also known}} as Brown Milbert's sand bar shark, brown shark, nigano shark, <b>oceanic</b> white-tipped whaler, and silvertip shark, is a large pelagic requiem shark inhabiting {{tropical}} and warm temperate seas. Its stocky body is most notable for its long, white-tipped, rounded fins.|$|E
5|$|The various {{formations}} of Siletzia {{are characterized}} as marine tholeiitic pillow basalts and volcanic breccia, often interbedded with sedimentary layers of continental origin, lying on <b>oceanic</b> crust. These are usually capped by {{a layer of}} alkalic volcanics deposited subaerially. All this suggests these formations were initially deposited in an <b>oceanic</b> environment, possibly as seamounts or an island arc.|$|E

5|$|Bathymetry is {{the mapping}} and {{study of the}} {{topography}} of the ocean floor. Methods used for measuring {{the depth of the}} sea include single or multibeam echosounders, laser airborne depth sounders and the calculation of depths from satellite remote sensing data. This information is used for determining the routes of undersea cables and pipelines, for choosing suitable locations for siting oil rigs and offshore wind turbines and for identifying possible new fisheries. The Earth is composed of a magnetic central core, a mostly liquid mantle, and a hard rigid outer shell (or lithosphere), which is composed of the Earth's rocky crust and the deeper and mostly solid outer layer of the mantle. The crust below land is known as continental while that under the abyssal sea is called <b>oceanic.</b> The latter is composed of relatively dense basalt and is some five to ten kilometers (three to six miles) thick. The relatively thin lithosphere floats on the weaker and hotter mantle below and is fractured into a number of tectonic plates. In mid-ocean, magma is constantly being thrust through the seabed between adjoining plates to form mid-oceanic ridges and here convection currents within the mantle tend to drive the two plates apart. Parallel to these ridges and nearer the coasts, one <b>oceanic</b> plate may slide beneath another <b>oceanic</b> plate in a process known as subduction. Deep trenches are formed here and the process is accompanied by friction as the plates grind together. The movement proceeds in jerks which cause earthquakes. Heat is also produced and magma is forced up, creating underwater mountains, some of which grow into volcanic islands. Near some boundaries between the land and sea, the slightly denser <b>oceanic</b> plates slide beneath the continental plates and more subduction trenches are formed. As they grate together, the continental plates are deformed and buckle causing mountain building and seismic activity.|$|E
5|$|Canterbury {{experiences}} an <b>oceanic</b> climate (Köppen climate classification Cfb), {{similar to}} {{almost all of}} the United Kingdom.

5|$|For a phylum with {{relatively}} few species, ctenophores {{have a wide}} range of body plans. Coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles, while some <b>oceanic</b> species are so fragile that {{it is very difficult to}} capture them intact for study. In addition <b>oceanic</b> species do not preserve well, and are known mainly from photographs and from observers' notes. Hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera – Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis. At least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid Pleurobrachia.|$|E
5|$|Foram dissolution: Foraminifera tests {{appear to}} be more eroded during H3 and H6 (Gwiazda et al., 1996). That may {{indicate}} an influx of nutrient-rich, hence corrosive, Antarctic Bottom Water by a reconfiguration of <b>oceanic</b> circulation patterns.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the International Union for Conservation of Nature's IUCN Red List of Endangered Species named 64 species, {{one-third of}} all <b>oceanic</b> shark species, as being at risk of {{extinction}} due to fishing and shark finning.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) {{rejected}} proposals {{from the}} United States and Palau {{that would have}} required countries to strictly regulate trade in several species of scalloped hammerhead, <b>oceanic</b> whitetip and spiny dogfish sharks. The majority, but not the required two-thirds of voting delegates, approved the proposal. China, by far the world's largest shark market, and Japan, which battles all attempts to extend the convention to marine species, led the opposition. In March 2013, three endangered commercially valuable sharks, the hammerheads, the <b>oceanic</b> whitetip and porbeagle were added to Appendix 2 of CITES, bringing shark fishing and commerce of these species under licensing and regulation.|$|E

5|$|On May21, 2007, the National <b>Oceanic</b> and Atmospheric Administration's Central Pacific Hurricane Center {{released}} its {{outlook for the}} 2007 Central Pacific hurricane season, predicting a total of 2–3 tropical cyclones to form or cross into the basin; in a typical season, 4–5 systems cross or form in the Central Pacific. A day later, the National <b>Oceanic</b> and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center {{released its}} seasonal prediction for the 2007 East Pacific hurricane season, predicting a total of 11–16 named storms, 6–9 hurricanes, and 2–4 major hurricanes. Below-average activity was expected {{as a result of}} either ENSO-Neutral or La Niña conditions, as well as the continuation of the reduction in activity beginning in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{several studies}} have shown that archaea exist not only in {{mesophilic}} and thermophilic environments but are also present, sometimes in high numbers, at low temperatures as well. For example, archaea are common in cold <b>oceanic</b> environments such as polar seas. Even more significant are the large numbers of archaea found throughout the world's oceans in non-extreme habitats among the plankton community (as part of the picoplankton). Although these archaea can be present in extremely high numbers (up to 40% of the microbial biomass), almost none of these species have been isolated and studied in pure culture. Consequently, our understanding of the role of archaea in ocean ecology is rudimentary, so their full influence on global biogeochemical cycles remains largely unexplored. Some marine Crenarchaeota are capable of nitrification, suggesting these organisms may affect the <b>oceanic</b> nitrogen cycle, although these <b>oceanic</b> Crenarchaeota may also use other sources of energy. Vast numbers of archaea are also found in the sediments that cover the sea floor, with these organisms making up the majority of living cells at depths over 1 meter below the ocean bottom. It has been demonstrated that in all <b>oceanic</b> surface sediments (from 1000- to 10,000-m water depth), the impact of viral infection is higher on archaea than on bacteria and virus-induced lysis of archaea accounts for up to one-third of the total microbial biomass killed, resulting in the release of ~0.3 to 0.5 gigatons of carbon per year globally.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the <b>Océanic</b> for the 2004–05 season, Crosby {{continued}} {{dominating the}} league, leading {{the league with}} 66 goals, 102 assists and 168 points over 62 games to capture his second consecutive Beliveau Trophy. Joining Crosby on Rimouski's top line were wingers Dany Roussin and Marc-Antoine Pouliot, who finished second and third in league-scoring with 116 and 114 points, respectively. In addition to his scoring title, Crosby was once again awarded Most Valuable Player, Offensive Player and Personality of the Year, while repeating as a QMJHL First All-Star. The <b>Océanic</b> finished with the regular season with {{the best record in}} the league, registering 45 wins and 98 points, including a league record-setting 28-game undefeated streak. They went on to capture the President's Cup as QMJHL playoff champions, defeating the Halifax Mooseheads in the finals. Crosby led the playoffs with 31 points (14 goals and 17 assists) over 13 games, earning him the Guy Lafleur Trophy as post-season MVP. With their QMJHL championship, the <b>Océanic</b> qualified for the 2005 Memorial Cup, Canada's national major junior tournament. Meeting the London Knights in the final, the <b>Océanic</b> were shut out, 4–0. Despite the loss, Crosby was named to the Tournament All-Star Team and captured the Ed Chynoweth Trophy as the competition's leading scorer with 11 points (6 goals and 5 assists) over 5 games. Knights forward Corey Perry was awarded the Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy as the MVP. Soon after, he attended the NHL prospect combine in preparation for the 2005 NHL Entry Draft.|$|E
5|$|Season five began airing on January 21, 2009, {{and ended}} on May 13, 2009, {{featuring}} seventeen episodes. A clip show recapping {{the first four}} seasons preceded the premiere. Season five follows two time lines. The first takes place on the island, where the remaining survivors begin to erratically jump forward and backward through time, following the island being moved in both space and time by Ben, and focuses on the events that lead up to Locke stopping the time jumps and leaving the Island. The second takes place off the island following Locke's death and deals with Jack and Ben's attempt to reunite the <b>Oceanic</b> Six {{and return to the}} island with Locke's dead body. The second part of the season starts after the time jumps end and the <b>Oceanic</b> Six return to the island on Ajira Airways Flight 316. The show continues to follow two time lines, both of which take place on the island. The first takes place in 1977 when the survivors who had been left behind are stranded after jumping around in time. It is also where some of the <b>Oceanic</b> Six are transported during the return flight to the island. The second takes place in late 2007 after Flight 316 is forced to crash land on the island.|$|E
5|$|Sharks can {{be highly}} social, {{remaining}} in large schools. Sometimes more than 100 scalloped hammerheads congregate around seamounts and islands, e.g., in the Gulf of California. Cross-species social hierarchies exist. For example, <b>oceanic</b> whitetip sharks dominate silky sharks of comparable size during feeding.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen {{years before}} <b>Oceanic</b> 815 crashes on the island, Rousseau was a heavily {{pregnant}} {{member of a}} six-person crew aboard a French research vessel three days out of Tahiti. The crew picked up a radio signal emanating from the South Pacific, which was a repeating set of six numbers: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42. While attempting to find {{the source of the}} signal, the ship ran aground on rocks surrounding the island. Before reaching the shore, Rousseau and her team found <b>Oceanic</b> 815 survivor Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) in the water, who had been time-travelling {{as a result of the}} time shifts which had been moving him and the flight survivors through the island's history.|$|E
5|$|Taftan {{is part of}} a {{volcanic}} arc in Iran, together with Bazman, also in Iran, and Koh-i-Sultan in Pakistan.

5|$|The Jeannette {{expedition}} {{was followed}} by the 1893–1896 Arctic expedition of Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen aboard the Fram, which proved that the Arctic Ocean was a deep <b>oceanic</b> basin, uninterrupted by any significant land masses north of the Eurasian continent.|$|E
5|$|The {{biodiversity}} {{of local}} <b>oceanic</b> fauna {{is not well}} understood.

5|$|The cooling of Antarctica {{occurred}} stepwise, as {{the continental}} spread changed the <b>oceanic</b> currents from longitudinal equator-to-pole temperature-equalising currents to latitudinal currents that preserved and accentuated latitude temperature differences.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of the abyssal plain {{is the result of}} the spreading of the seafloor (plate tectonics) and the melting of the lower <b>oceanic</b> crust. Magma rises from above the asthenosphere (a layer of the upper mantle), and as this basaltic material reaches the surface at mid-ocean ridges, it forms new <b>oceanic</b> crust, which is constantly pulled sideways by spreading of the seafloor. Abyssal plains result from the blanketing of an originally uneven surface of <b>oceanic</b> crust by fine-grained sediments, mainly clay and silt. Much of this sediment is deposited by turbidity currents that have been channelled from the continental margins along submarine canyons into deeper water. The rest is composed chiefly of pelagic sediments. Metallic nodules are common in some areas of the plains, with varying concentrations of metals, including manganese, iron, nickel, cobalt, and copper.|$|E
5|$|The episode's five flashbacks {{focus on}} the {{reactions}} and activities of the freighter's crew who made contact with the <b>Oceanic</b> 815 survivors; Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies) is shown crying while watching a newscast confirming the deaths of all <b>Oceanic</b> 815 passengers. His caretaker asks why he is crying, and he answers {{that he does not}} know. Miles Straume (Ken Leung) is a medium hired by an elderly woman to remove the ghost of her grandson from her home. After conversing with the spirit, Miles finds a hidden cache of money and drugs. Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader) is an anthropologist who finds a polar bear skeleton bearing a Dharma Initiative collar buried in the Tunisian desert. Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) is an alcoholic who was originally scheduled to pilot flight 815. He phones the <b>Oceanic</b> hotline while watching the newscast and claims that the footage of the plane wreckage being aired on television is not authentic, while Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason) is shown in a posthumous flashback, criticizing her employer Matthew Abaddon (Lance Reddick) for his choice in her coworkers.|$|E
5|$|The geology and {{geomorphology}} of {{the area}} is complex and the islands and the surrounding sea lochs each have distinctive features. The influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Atlantic Drift create a mild, damp <b>oceanic</b> climate.|$|E
