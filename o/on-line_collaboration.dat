The working group had researched the possibility of finding a proprietary solution for OSFs’ communication and collaboration needs, but could not find an appropriate solution that could offer both the functionality that OSF was looking for and the flexibility to be able to offer tools to partner organizations and other individuals (grantees, consultants, specialists, etc.) working closely with OSF without being subjected to restrictive licensing fees and requiring users to install special software. The working group had been quite pleased with the Plone collaboration tool that was being used to manage the work of the group, so the further recommendation was made to develop this new system using the open source Plone software over the Zope application server.|$|E

To promote effective collaboration, {{it is vital}} to reveal both the student’s and the instructor’s point of view pertaining to effective <b>on-line</b> <b>collaboration.</b> In this study, the effectiveness of a learning management system in <b>on-line</b> <b>collaboration</b> was first investigated in a graduate course offered through the means of distance learning. In this first phase of this study, the nature of collaboration, the students perceptions of the effectiveness of the tool in <b>on-line</b> <b>collaboration,</b> the factors contributing to effective peer interaction among students {{and the role of the}} instructor as perceived by the students in the on-line course were explored.

This is {{a particular type of}} social dilemma, where short-term immediate self-interests are at odds with long-term collective benefits. Perhaps the best known solution to the free-rider problem in social dilemmas is communication between participants prior to making contributions to the public good. However, there is research to suggest that people contribute less to public goods while communicating on-line before the dilemma, as opposed to face-to-face discussion. This chapter will discuss why computer-mediated mediums of communication are less effective at improving cooperation amongst collaborators (e. g., lack of social cues to examine the credibility of commitment, less leadership, and poorer monitoring of other’s behavior) and propose several means for addressing this challenge to <b>on-line</b> <b>collaborations</b> (e. g., videoconference, telephone communication, prior face-to-face interactions, frequent coordinated communications, and reputation evaluations) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{an effort to}} use Stagecast CreatorTM {{as a means for}} {{developing}} modelling skills among undergraduate students taking an introductory course in science that took place in a virtual learning environment (WebCTTM). An inquiry-based curriculum was implemented, which guided students working in small groups to collect and study moon observations and construct a series of successive models of the moon phases using Stagecast CreatorTM. Students' reflective journals and reports of synchronous discussions were the means for collecting data. The findings show that the WebCTTM platform supported the <b>on-line</b> <b>collaboration</b> among students in the course that was used to help them improve their models through the use of Stagecast CreatorTM. Specifically, students' groups shared their models with other groups through WebCTTM, and provided feedback about each other's models, indicating model limitations and suggesting possible improvements. The results also suggest that students believed that the <b>on-line</b> <b>collaboration</b> supported their learning growth as well as the process of developing modelling skills. Students found it extremely fruitful to exchange ideas with other groups, to read and make suggestions for model improvements and to collaborate with almost all students in the course – which would have been impossible without the <b>on-line</b> <b>collaboration</b> tool. Collaboration in learning situations like the one presented in this paper involves exchanging, negotiating and critiquing ideas for the purpose of building new, more refined knowledge. This collaborative process became feasible {{due to the fact that}} sharing and viewing Stagecast CreatorTM files through the Internet is fully compatible with web-browsers.

Reputation systems can help stem abuse, and can offer indications of content quality. We discuss some basic design principles and choices in the design of content-driven reputation systems, which rely on an analysis of the content and the collaboration process, rather than on explicit user feedback. Content-driven reputation systems can be easier to employ and harder to subvert. We illustrate the choices in their design by examining two systems we have built: the WikiTrust reputation system for Wikipedia authors and content, and the Crowdsensus reputation system for Google Maps editors.

40|$|Research {{suggests}} that collaboration in an on-line course can enhance learning, reduce feelings of isolation, increase {{satisfaction with the}} course, and increase motivation. Unfortunately, creating an environment within which collaboration can occur doesn’t happen automatically. A {{review of the literature}} {{suggests that}} for <b>on-line</b> <b>collaboration</b> to be most effective, participants must: (1) see the value of expending the (considerable) effort required, (2) be comfortable with and trust the medium, (3) be comfortable with and trust their instructor (or facilitator) and their fellow collaborators, and (4) feel as though they are immersed in a rich, engaging, and rewarding social experience. While many papers suggest that one or more initial face-to-face meetings will expedite trust, familiarity, and a willingness to collaborate, one of the primary reasons why students engage in distance learning is the convenience of anytime, anyplace learning. Thus, face-to-face meetings are not always possible or desirable, leaving us with the need to address these issues in more creative ways.

Using this literature to enrich their knowledge and improve their assessment submissions. This acquisition and discovery of literature is usually gathered during a student's self directed study period.

In this paper, we present a novel peer-to-peer (P 2 P) stream processing system called peerTalk to provide resource-efficient and failure-resilient MVoIP services. Different from previous work, our solution is fully distributed and self-organizing without requiring specialized servers or IP multicast support. Particularly, we decouple the stream processing in MVoIP services into two phases: (1) aggregation phase that mixes audio streams from active speakers into a single stream; and (2) distribution phase that distributes the mixed audio stream to all listeners. The decoupled model allows us to optimize and adapt the P 2 P stream mixing and distribution processes separately. Specifically, we can adaptively spread stream mixing workload among resource-constrained peer hosts according to current speaking activities. We have implemented a prototype of the peerTalk system and conducted experiments in real-world wide-area networks. The results show that peerTalk can achieve lower resource contention and better service quality than previous common solutions...|$|R
40|$|As decision-makers, {{engineers}} must be {{knowledgeable and}} competent in multiple aspects of design. Engineering {{is more than}} a problem solving activity focusing on simply the expected performance of designed artifacts.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{describes}} a three-year research project {{leading to the}} development of the CBR Monitoring Manual and Menu (MM&M). The MM&M is a practical toolkit that meets the needs of CBR managers and stakeholders, and is consistent with the philosophy of CBR and community-based disability-inclusive development. It is designed to produce meaningful and locally useful information and data, based on international data standards where possible, to enable aggregation at regional, national and international levels. Methods: Five complementary workstreams of research were carried out from 2011 to 2014 : 1) literature review and analysis; 2) participatory action research with CBR stakeholders; 3) analysis and refinement of validity of concepts and structures; 4) consultation and review; and 5) synthesis of results. This article documents the method and key results of each of the five workstreams, and the lessons learned along the way. Results: The MM&M is now freely available <b>on-line</b> at [URL] <b>Collaboration</b> among members of the development team continues, chiefly via an on-line group to which new members have been welcomed. Conclusion and Implications: At the time of writing, the MM&M is the only international monitoring product, known to the authors, that consciously sets out to reflect both a ‘bottom- up’ and ‘top-down’ perspective of monitoring information and data. To achieve this for a complex programme such as CBR, and to align with its principles, it was essential to use a multi-component and multi-stage strategy for tool development, involving a diverse multidisciplinary team includingcollaboration with CBR stakeholders...|$|R

Participatory research models of engagement are the most empowering for consumers. MethodsAs part of a project to develop a diagnostic instrument for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in Australia (FASD Project), the Australian FASD Collaboration (Collaboration), including a consumer advocate and two consumer representatives, was established. On completion of the FASD Project an <b>on-line</b> survey of <b>Collaboration</b> members was conducted to assess their views on consumer involvement. Women in the community were also {{invited to participate in}} Community Conversations to discuss real life situations regarding communications with health professionals about alcohol and pregnancy. Community Conversation feedback was analysed qualitatively and attendees were surveyed about their views of the Community Conversation process. ResultsThe on-line survey was completed by 12 members of the Collaboration (71 %). Consumer and community participation was considered important and essential, worked well, and was integral {{to the success of the}} project. The 32 women attending the Community Conversations generated 500 statements that made reference to prevention, how information and messages are delivered, and appropriate support for women. Nearly all the attendees at the Community Conversations (93 %) believed that they had an opportunity to put forward their ideas and 96 % viewed the Community Conversations as a positive experience.

40|$|AIM: The {{goal of the}} Collaboration Spotting {{project is}} to create an {{automatic}} system to collect information about publications and patents related to a given technology, to identify the key players involved, and to highlight collaborations and related technologies. The collected information can be visualized in a web browser as interactive graphical maps showing in an intuitive way the players and their collaborations (Sociogram) and the relations among the technologies (Technogram). We propose to use the system to study technologies related to oral medicine. METHODS: In order to create a sociogram, we create a logical filter based on a set of keywords related to the technology under study. This filter is used to extract a list of publications from the Web of Science™ database. The list is validated by an expert in the technology and sent to CERN where it is inserted in the Collaboration Spotting database. Here, an automatic software system uses the data to generate the final maps. RESULTS: We studied a set of recent technologies related to bone regeneration procedures of oro-maxillo-facial critical size defects, namely the use of porous hydroxyapatite (HA) as a bone substitute alone (bone graft) or as a tridimensional support (scaffold) for insemination and differentiation ex vivo of mesenchymal stem cells. We produced the sociograms for these technologies and the resulting maps are now accessible <b>on-line.</b> CONCLUSION: The <b>Collaboration</b> Spotting system allows the automatic creation of interactive maps to show the current and historical state of research on a specific technology. These maps are an ideal tool both for researchers who want to assess the state-of-the-art in a given technology, and for research organizations who want to evaluate their contribution to the technological development in a given field. We demonstrated that the system can be used in oral medicine as is produced the maps for an initial set of technologies in this field.

40|$|The {{very notion}} of a fully Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) Virtual Environment (VE) {{represents}} a unique challenge {{within the realm of}} networking and distributed systems. Online games are a prime example of VEs, with successful titles boasting of thousands of players. The scale of such applications places exacting demands on the underlying network. With the premium placed on accuracy and interaction speed, on-line games are sensitive to network latencies and bandwidth demands. By aiming for a P 2 P architecture, the task of managing a dynamic player population is made ever more daunting. Resource scalability and system resiliency, hallmark P 2 P characteristics, are hampered by the need for secure and responsive game-play. Inter-peer communications need to facilitate smooth game-play and consistency, while ensuring fairness. Simply, players will not tolerate slow connections, nor cheaters that modify peer updates. For these reasons, CS architectures have an established presence within this space. It is easier to restrict player connections to a centralised server, and thus validate game-play from there. Issues pertaining to the adjudication of player interactions, are almost trivialised. However, the obvious drawback to the CS approach is scalability. As the numbers soar, so does the demands placed on such centralised services. Whilst we often hear of the scale achieved in the numbers of active players for a particular game, less obvious is the fact that players are in distinct slices of the virtual world supported by a single server. And thus, the raison d&# 039;etre for a P 2 P-VE, and our efforts to eventuate it, becomes clearer. We seek to allow peers to seamlessly connect with one another within a continuous and evolving virtual world. Scalability limitations are cast aside with a P 2 P overlay designed to efficiently connect a heterogeneous peer population. For any VE, arbitrating player interactions is an inescapable need. <b>On-line</b> games involve <b>collaboration</b> and competition, requiring robust conflict resolution mechanisms. With CS, arbitration duties are assigned to provisioned servers. In a P 2 P system however, the issue looms large. As such, the facilitation of arbitration services is the focus of the work contained herein. Here, we exploit 3 D Voronoi Diagrams (3 D-VD) as a scalable, flexible and fault-tolerant P 2 P network overlay, to fluidly distribute arbitration services amongst peers. More than area partitioning tools, and the novelty here lies in our utilization of an additional 3 rd dimension which embodies non-spatial metrics. Thus, the Z-axis is used to signify other measures, such as current resource capacity. The proposed approach effectuates more fluid self-organisation within the VE. Work-loads of resource intensive arbitration are handled dynamically at localised clusters. Service speed is ensured as peers easily appoint arbitrators amongst themselves. The result is a decentralised mechanism that addresses responsiveness and security concerns, and mitigates the limitations of CS architectures. Simulations verify the feasibility and performance of the technique, ultimately reducing arbitration failures. 3 D-VD can also appropriately distribute loads and reduce fluctuations. We also augmented the 3 D-VD technique with Newtonian laws that respond to high-demand areas and further reducing failed arbitration attempts...|$|R
