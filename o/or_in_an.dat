5|$|A loon’s wail is a {{long call}} {{consisting}} of up to three notes, and is often compared to a wolf’s howl. It uses this call to communicate its location to other loons. The call is given {{back and forth between}} breeding pairs or an adult and its chick, either to maintain contact <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attempt to move closer together after being separated. It is a loud aaoo, weee-wea weee-wea weee-wea, or ooo-aaah-éééé.|$|E
5|$|For the {{production}} of ferromanganese, the manganese ore is mixed with iron ore and carbon, and then reduced either in a blast furnace <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> electric arc furnace. The resulting ferromanganese has a manganese content of 30 to 80%. Pure manganese used for {{the production}} of iron-free alloys is produced by leaching manganese ore with sulfuric acid and a subsequent electrowinning process.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} album, Room Service, significant portions of the album were produced while on tour. According to co-writer Jim Vallance modern technology and equipment made {{it a lot easier}} to record the album. Adams recorded the album while on tour, making use of the time between playing on stage and readying himself for the next gig. Vallance and Adams recorded the album normally while sitting backstage <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> hotel room with small devices which they usually carried along on tours, but especially during their off days. Adams, in an interview, mentioned that when recording a song, they needed to set up mattresses against the windows, and having microphones run through the toilet.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are used}} recreationally and by {{problematic}} drug misusers. Mortality is higher among poly-drug misusers that also use benzodiazepines. Heavy alcohol use also increases mortality among poly-drug users. Dependence and tolerance, often coupled with dosage escalation, to benzodiazepines can develop rapidly among drug misusers; withdrawal syndrome may appear after {{as little as}} three weeks of continuous use. Long-term use {{has the potential to}} cause both physical and psychological dependence and severe withdrawal symptoms such as depression, anxiety (often to the point of panic attacks), and agoraphobia. Benzodiazepines and, in particular, temazepam are sometimes used intravenously, which, if done incorrectly <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> unsterile manner, can lead to medical complications including abscesses, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, arterial puncture, deep vein thrombosis, and gangrene. Sharing syringes and needles for this purpose also brings up the possibility of transmission of hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases. Benzodiazepines are also misused intranasally, which may have additional health consequences. Once benzodiazepine dependence has been established, a clinician usually converts the patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam before beginning a gradual reduction program.|$|E

5|$|FLCN {{creates a}} protein called folliculin that has two isoforms. It appears {{to act as}} a tumor {{suppressor}} and is expressed strongly in the skin, distal nephrons, and type I pneumocytes. It has also been found in the parotid gland, brain, breast, pancreas, prostate, and ovaries. Tumor suppressors normally prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> uncontrolled way. Mutations in the FLCN gene may interfere with the ability of folliculin to restrain cell growth and division, leading to the formation of noncancerous and cancerous tumors. Recent studies suggest that folliculin accomplishes this function through its involvement with cellular metabolism, possibly through modulation of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway and/or oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Folliculin interacts with FNIP1 and FNIP2 (FLCN-interacting protein) to form a complex with AMP-activated protein kinase. Folliculin's participation in the mTOR pathway may explain the similarity in phenotype between BHD syndrome, Cowden syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Stephen E. Loeb {{proposed}} that accounting ethics education should include seven goals (adapted {{from a list}} by Daniel Callahan). To implement these goals, {{he pointed out that}} accounting ethics could be taught throughout accounting curriculum <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> individual class tailored to the subject. Requiring it be taught throughout the curriculum would necessitate all accounting teachers to have knowledge on the subject (which may require training). A single course has issues as to where to include the course in a student's education (for example, before preliminary accounting classes or near the end of a student's degree requirements), whether there is enough material to cover in a semester class, and whether most universities have room in a four-year curriculum for a single class on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Infants and {{patients}} fed via a gastrostomy tube {{can also be}} given a ketogenic diet. Parents make up a prescribed powdered formula, such as KetoCal, into a liquid feed. Gastrostomy feeding avoids any issues with palatability, and bottle-fed infants readily accept the ketogenic formula. Some studies have found this liquid feed to be more efficacious and associated with lower total cholesterol than a solid ketogenic diet. KetoCal is a nutritionally complete food containing milk protein and is supplemented with amino acids, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals and trace elements. It is used to administer the 4:1 ratio classic ketogenic diet in children over one year. The formula is available in both 3:1 and 4:1 ratios, either unflavoured <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> artificially sweetened vanilla flavour and is suitable for tube or oral feeding. Other formula products include KetoVolve and Ketonia. Alternatively, a liquid ketogenic diet may be produced by combining Ross Carbohydrate Free soy formula with Microlipid and Polycose.|$|E

5|$|Players must guide a {{boy scout}} through a 43-room mansion {{in order to}} obtain 16 keys and a {{combination}} before running out of time. These unlock a safe containing the pills needed to save the mansion owner's life. It is necessary to jump onto platforms and evade enemies in order to progress. At the start of the game the player has three lives; a life is lost should the boy scout fall too far or come into contact with one of the mansion's servants or traps. Rooms contain doors that can be entered to move around the mansion, as well as push buttons and hazards. Pressing buttons can result in lifts being activated, platforms appearing <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> enemy appearing. One of the mansion's rooms is a corridor of eight doors with a large pair of eyes above them; this room acts as a maze. A tune is played continuously during play, but can be toggled on or off.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{some other}} red dyes {{obtained}} from scale insects, the red coloring is derived from carminic acid with traces of kermesic acid. The Polish cochineal carminic acid content is approximately 0.6% of the insect's dried body weight. The insects were harvested shortly before the female larvae reached maturity, i.e. in late June, usually around Saint John the Baptist's day (June 24), hence the dye's folk name, Saint John's blood. The harvesting process involved uprooting the host plant and picking the female larvae, averaging approximately ten insects from each plant. In Poland, including present-day Ukraine, and elsewhere in Europe, plantations were operated {{in order to deal}} with the high toll on the host plants. The larvae were killed with boiling water or vinegar and dried in the sun <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> oven, ground, and dissolved in sourdough or in light rye beer called kvass in order to remove fat. The extract could then be used for dyeing silk, wool, cotton, or linen. The dyeing process requires roughly 3-4oz of dye per pound (180-250g per kilogram) of silk and one pound of dye to color almost 20pounds (50g per kilogram) of wool.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{handling}} {{room was}} {{just below the}} visible part of the mount. It was armored and reinforced to support {{the weight of the}} mount. A person standing in the upper handling room could look up and see the bottom of the gun mount inside the training circle on which the mount rotated. Hanging from the mount, and rotating with it, was the equipment used to pass ammunition up to the mount. This included the lower ends of the projectile and powder case hoists. In {{the center of the room}} there was a vertical tube that also turned with the mount. This tube enclosed the electrical power and control cables going up to the mount. Around the perimeter of the upper handling room were the ready service ammunition racks welded to the bulkheads. Close by, either in a corner of the handling room <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> adjoining compartment was the upper end of an ammunition hoist from the magazine. The responsibility of the men stationed in the upper handling room was to shuttle 30 to 40 projectiles and 30 to 40 powder cases per minute from the ready service racks to the hoists while avoiding the equipment rotating with the mount. During quiet spells, they would replenish the ready service racks with ammunition from the magazines.|$|E
