40|$|The {{scheduling}} of real-time tasks with primary-backup based fault-tolerant requirements {{has been}} an important problem for several years. Most of the known scheduling schemes are non-adaptive in nature meaning that they do not adapt to the dynamics of faults and task's parameters in the system. In this paper, we propose an adaptive faulttolerant scheduling scheme that has a mechanism to control the <b>overlap</b> <b>interval</b> between the primary and backup versions of tasks such that the overall performance of the system is improved. The <b>overlap</b> <b>interval</b> is determined based on the estimated primary fault probability and task's soft laxity. We also propose a new performance index that integrates schedulability (S) and reliability (R) into a single metric, called SR index. To evaluate the proposed scheme, we have conducted analytical and simulation studies under dierent fault and deadline scenarios, and found that the proposed adaptive scheme adapts to system dynamics and oers better SR index than that of the non-adaptive schemes...|$|E
40|$|The meridional {{circulation}} at high latitudes {{is crucial to}} the buildup and reversal of the Sun’s polar magnetic fields. Here, we characterize the axisymmetric flows by applying a magnetic feature cross-correlation procedure to high-resolution magnetograms obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We focus on Carrington rotations 2096 – 2107 (2010 April to 2011 March) —the <b>overlap</b> <b>interval</b> between HMI and the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI). HMI magnetograms averaged over 720 s are first mapped into heliographic coordinates. Strips from these maps are then cross-correlated to determine the distances in latitude and longitude that the magnetic element pattern has moved, thus providing meridional flow and differential rotation velocities for each rotation of the Sun. Flow velocities were averaged for the <b>overlap</b> <b>interval</b> and compared to results obtained from MDI data. This comparison indicates that these HMI images are rotated counterclockwise by 0. ◦ 075 with respect to the Sun’s rotation axis. The profiles indicate that HMI data can be used to reliably measure these axisymmetric flow velocities to at least within 5 ◦ of the poles. Unlike the noisier MDI measurements, no evidence of a meridional flow counter-cell is seen in either hemisphere with the HMI measurements: poleward flow continues {{all the way to the}} poles. Slight north–south asymmetries are observed in the meridional flow. These asymmetries should contribute to the observed asymmetries in the polar fields and the timing of their reversals...|$|E
40|$|AbstractStationary and pursuit {{fixation}} {{may involve}} different fixation mechanisms that are reflected by differences in saccadic reaction times (SRTs). Gap, Simultaneous, and <b>Overlap</b> <b>interval</b> paradigms provided three distinct SRT ranges for comparisons {{between these two}} viewing conditions. SRTs following pursuit fixation were longer than following stationary fixation, but were similarly affected by the interval paradigms. The SRT increase with smooth pursuit was largely explained by additional demands for programming oblique saccades. The paradigm dependent SRT relationships also persisted after timing cues were minimized. These results indicate that stationary and pursuit fixation have similar responses to different fixation paradigms and do not implicate the existence of multiple fixation processes...|$|E

40|$|Each tuple in a valid-time {{relation}} {{includes an}} interval attribute T {{that represents the}} tuple's valid time. The overlap join between two valid-time relations determines all pairs of tuples with overlapping intervals. Although overlap joins are common, existing partitioning and indexing schemes are inefficient if the data includes long-lived tuples or if intervals intersect partition boundaries. We propose <b>Overlap</b> <b>Interval</b> Partitioning (OIP), a new partitioning approach for data with an interval. OIP divides the time range of a relation into k base granules and defines overlapping partitions for sequences of contiguous granules. OIP is the first partitioning method for interval data that gives a constant clustering guarantee: the difference in duration between the interval of a tuple and the interval of its partition is independent of {{the duration of the}} tuple's interval. We offer a detailed analysis of the average false hit ratio and the average number of partition accesses for queries with overlap predicates, and we prove that the average false hit ratio is independent of the number of short- and long-lived tuples. To compute the overlap join, we propose the <b>Overlap</b> <b>Interval</b> Partition Join (OIPJoin), which uses OIP to partition the input relations on-the-fly. Only the tuples from overlapping partitions have to be joined to compute the result. We analytically derive the optimal number of granules, k, for partitioning the two input relations, from the size of the data, the cost of CPU operations, and the cost of main memory or disk IOs. Our experiments confirm the analytical results and show that the OIPJoin outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for the overlap join...|$|E

40|$|If the hot, X-ray {{emitting}} gas in rich clusters forms a fair {{sample of}} the universe (as in Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models), and the universe is at the critical density, Ω_T = 1, then the data appears to imply a baryon fraction, Ω_b,x (Ω_b,x≡Ω_b derived from X-ray cluster data), larger than that predicted by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). While various other systematic effects such as clumping can lower Ω_b,x, {{in this paper we}} use an elementary analysis to show that a simple admixture of Hot Dark Matter (HDM, low mass neutrinos) with CDM to yield mixed dark matter shifts Ω_b,x down so that significant overlap with Ω_b from BBN can occur for H_ 0 75 km/sec/Mpc, even without invoking the possible aforementioned effects. The <b>overlap</b> <b>interval</b> is slightly larger for lower mass neutrinos since fewer cluster on the scale of the hot X-ray gas. We illustrate this result quantitatively in terms of a simple isothermal model. More realistic velocity dispersion profiles, with less centrally-peaked density profiles, imply that fewer neutrinos are trapped and, thus, further increase the interval of overlap. However, we also note that if future observations of light element abundances find that Ω_b h^ 2 0. 018, the range of concordance in this simple mixed dark matter model vanishes.

40|$|To {{decrease}} the storage overhead {{and to increase}} efficiency, we use string key pool proposed in [10]. The OKS (Overlap key sharing) protocol generates a long bit-string to be the key-string-pool (KP) of the sensor network, and randomly assigns {{a subset of the}} key-string-pool to be the key-string stored in each sensor (shown in Fig. 2). Sensors in OKS protocol use the overlap intervals (number of bits overlapping between neighbors) of the key-strings as the shared secret key with their neighbor nodes. This differs from EG(Eschenauer-Gligor) in that the EG protocol [3] has key-pools of distinct keys; if a key (or many keys) are shared between two nodes, a secure connection is formed based on the key(s). In OKS, the key-string pool is a string of bits (not a pool of distinct keys). The bits of the key-string which overlap between two nodes are used as the shared secret key between them. As shown in Fig. 2, node A has been assigned key-string KA and node B has been assigned KB. B If node A and node B are neighbors, they use the <b>overlap</b> <b>interval</b> of KA and KB as the shared secret key KAB between them. Because the key-strings are randomly assigned to each sensor node, different pairs of sensor nodes have different sizes of overlap intervals. To create a fixed key size, padding bits to create a fixed length can be added, or a hash-function to expand the key length to fixed length can also be applied. Different key lengths have different algorithmic security levels and different key spaces. Before node deployment, every node is assigned sub-string key pool from the key setup server, and every pair of neighboring nodes chooses overlapped part from the sub-key string pool. Overlap key sharing[10] is explained i...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a new form}} of exemplar-based learning method, based on <b>overlapping</b> feature <b>intervals.</b> In this model, a concept is represented by a collection of <b>overlapping</b> <b>intervals</b> for each feature and class. Classification with <b>Overlapping</b> Feature <b>Intervals</b> (COFI) is a particular implementation of this technique. In this incremental, inductive and supervised learning method, the basic unit of the representation is an interval. The COFI algorithm learns the projections of the intervals in each feature dimension for each class. Initially, an interval is a point on a feature-class dimension, then it can be expanded through generalization. No specialization of intervals is done on feature-class dimensions by this algorithm. Classification in the COFI algorithm is based on a majority voting among the local predictions that are made individually by each feature. An evaluation of COFI and its comparison with similar other classification techniques is given. INTRODUCTION Learning re [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In this write-up, we extend {{quicksort}} to {{the task}} of fuzzy sorting of intervals. In many situations the precise value of a quantity is uncertain (e. g., any physical measurement is subject to noise). For such situations we may represent a measurement i as a closed interval [ai, bi], where ai ≤ bi. A fuzzysort is defined as a permutation 〈i 1, i 2, [...] ., in 〉 of the intervals such that there exist cj ∈ [aij, bij satisfying c 1 ≤ c 2 ≤ [...] . ≤ cn. This document summarizes the design of a fuzzy sorting algorithm which operates in-place on two arrays containing the interval endpoints. The proposed algorithm has the general structure of randomized quicksort. As a result, its expected running time is Θ(n lg n) for disjoint intervals. The presence of <b>overlapping</b> <b>intervals</b> is detected and reduces the expected running time. In fact, the proposed algorithm has an expected running time Θ(n) when all <b>intervals</b> <b>overlap</b> at some point. This document is organized in four sections. In Section 1 we introduce the basic strategy for fuzzy-sorting and a linear-time algorithm to detect the intersection of a set of intervals. In Section 2 we modify randomized quicksort to allow fuzzy sorting. In Section 3 we present a proof of correctness. Finally, in Section 4 we analyze the expected running time of the proposed algorithm. 1 Finding an <b>Overlapping</b> <b>Interval</b> in Linear Tim...|$|R
