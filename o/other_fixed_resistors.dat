40|$|In Signal Issue 31 Gerald Stancey G 3 MCK [1] {{asked about}} the {{criteria}} to be used and the risk assessments to be undertaken when employing vintage components and cabling in both prototype designs and rebuilds. This article aims to answer Gerald’s questions and is illustrated with a selection of vintage and more modern resistors and capacitors showing the relative sizes of the components and, sometimes more importantly, the (long) lengths of the wire spills available for connections in point-to-point wiring as well as <b>other</b> <b>fixing</b> options. <b>Resistors</b> The {{answer to the question}} concerning the recommended (or safe) power dissipation for resistors of given rating depends on the temperature at which the components are rated and the maximum allowable temperature in use. The manufacturers probably state in their specification that the resistor is rated, say, 2 W at an ambient temperature of 20 °C and de-rate the component so that, at 70 °C, it dissipates, maybe 30 % of its ambient temperature rating. For our purposes, when considerin...|$|R

40|$|In {{the shadow}} of microelectronics, passive {{components}} such as discrete resistors {{would seem to have}} fallen out of the field of view in electronics. Yet, it is the rare circuit that can do without resistors. And a look at a modern circuit board will show that it has become more difficult to locate them visually. OVERVIEW Linear <b>fixed</b> <b>resistors</b> are classified as film, foil, composition, Power Metal Strip®, and wirewound resistors, depending on the material used.

50|$|As {{counterpart}} to a current source, the electronic load is a current sink. When loading a current source with a <b>fixed</b> <b>resistor</b> one can set one determined load current by the connected load resistor. The {{characteristic of the}} electronic load is that the load current can be set and varied in a defined range. The load current is regulated electronically.|$|R
5000|$|At larger forward {{currents}} the current-voltage curve {{starts to}} be dominated by the ohmic resistance of the bulk semiconductor. The curve is no longer exponential, it is asymptotic to a straight line whose slope is the bulk resistance. This region is particularly important for power diodes.

5000|$|Produced by the German Loewe-Audion GmbH as {{far back}} as 1926, the device {{consisted}} of 3 triode valves (tubes) in a single glass envelope together with two fixed capacitors and four <b>fixed</b> <b>resistors</b> required to make a complete radio receiver. The resistors and capacitors had to be sealed in their own glass tubes to prevent them from contaminating the vacuum.|$|R

50|$|<b>Fixed</b> <b>resistors</b> {{are also}} widely used to limit inrush current. These are {{inherently}} less efficient, since the resistance never {{falls from the}} value required to limit the inrush current. Consequently they are generally chosen for lower power circuitry, where the additional ongoing power waste is minor. Inrush limiting resistors are much cheaper than thermistors. They are found in most compact fluorescent lamps (light bulbs).|$|R
5000|$|R6 a 50K ohm linear {{potentiometer}} is used (in {{series with}} a 50K ohm <b>fixed</b> <b>resistor</b> R5) form a voltage divider {{used to set}} the VCO duty cycle, the on time vs off time of the waveform (note that most variable inputs to this chip {{are looking for a}} resistance, this input looks for a voltage).

40|$|Several {{embodiments}} of RF {{source resistance}} measuring devices are disclosed. Common to all embodiments in the {{feature of the}} inclusion {{of at least one}} variable resistor, and a peak readout meter. In one embodiment, two ganged unloaded potentiometers are employed while another embodiment comprises an automaticnulling RF power bridge circuit with a variable rather than a fixed bridge reference resistance.

50|$|Instruments for {{measuring}} voltages include the voltmeter, the potentiometer, and the oscilloscope. The voltmeter works {{by measuring the}} current through a <b>fixed</b> <b>resistor,</b> which, according to Ohm's Law, {{is proportional to the}} voltage across the resistor. The potentiometer works by balancing the unknown voltage against a known voltage in a bridge circuit. The cathode-ray oscilloscope works by amplifying the voltage and using it to deflect an electron beam from a straight path, so that the deflection of the beam is proportional to the voltage.|$|R

50|$|An {{inrush current}} limiter is a {{component}} used to limit inrush current to avoid gradual damage to components and avoid blowing fuses or tripping circuit breakers. Negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors and <b>fixed</b> <b>resistors</b> {{are often used}} to limit inrush current. NTC thermistors {{can be used as}} inrush-current limiting devices in power supply circuits when added in series with the circuit being protected. They present a higher resistance initially, which prevents large currents from flowing at turn-on. As current continues to flow, NTC thermistors heat up, allowing higher current flow during normal operation. NTC thermistors are usually much larger than measurement type thermistors, and are purposely designed for power applications.|$|R
50|$|Electronic amateurs {{could build}} this circuit much more cheaply - e.g., with a four-position switch (four steps in {{level of the}} rear sound from min. to max. level) using <b>fixed</b> <b>resistors</b> of, for example, 20, 10, 5 and 0 (short-circuit) ohms. Because, in practice, only the highest level was of any use, a more basic set-up with only the <b>fixed</b> 10 ohm <b>resistor</b> at close-to-zero cost is possible.Note that the system {{requires}} more or less flat impedance curves for the rear speakers to work properly, which was often {{the case in the}} tube-amplifier days.Tube amplifiers had a constant impedance over a wide range, and worked best with high-efficiency speakers. Later on, when transistor amplifiers were used, speakers tended to lose that design feature. (Lower impedance meant higher power output for these amplifiers, compensating for the lower efficiency of such designs.) The system worked best using a transistor-based stereo amplifier, low-efficiency front speakers, and high-efficiency, constant impedance rear speakers.|$|R
25|$|Another {{common use}} of a ballast {{resistor}} in the automotive industry is adjusting the ventilation fan speed. The ballast is a <b>fixed</b> <b>resistor</b> with usually two center taps, and the fan speed selector switch is used to bypass portions of the ballast: all of them for full speed, and none for the low speed setting. A very common failure occurs when the fan is being constantly run at the next-to-full speed setting (usually 3 out of 4). This will cause a very short piece of resistor coil to be operated with a relatively high current (up to 10A), eventually burning it out. This will render the fan unable to run at the reduced speed settings.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] {{resistor}} is {{a passive}} two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors {{are used to}} reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses. High-power resistors that can dissipate many watts of electrical power as heat {{may be used as}} part of motor controls, in power distribution systems, or as test loads for generators. <b>Fixed</b> <b>resistors</b> have resistances that only change slightly with temperature, time or operating voltage. Variable resistors can be used to adjust circuit elements (such as a volume control or a lamp dimmer), or as sensing devices for heat, light, humidity, force, or chemical activity.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{minimise}} the event pile-up and therefore optimise the detection efficiency, Chorus and Nomad experiments {{ask for a}} long and rectangular spill profile. At present the fast-slow extractio n is generated by driving the beam into a quadrupolar-octopolar resonance by exciting a quadrupole magnet with a semi-trapezoidal current [1]. The trapezoidal pulse shape is obtained by dischargin g a capacitor into the magnet coils. After a few milliseconds of undamped discharge a <b>fixed</b> <b>resistor</b> is switched into the circuit. The attenuation is then higher and the sine wave continues with a lower gradient. The two gradients can be adjusted by varying the initial capacitor voltage and the time at which the resistor is switched into the circuit. A further degree of freedom in determini ng the spill shape has been added by allowing the possibility of changing the second slope value independently of the initial conditions. This task is achieved {{by means of a}} variable current sour ce added in parallel to the <b>fixed</b> <b>resistor.</b> This current source consists of a circuit based on IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor) switches controlled in their linear characteristics. With this configuration, an adjustment of the second slope from damped to undamped discharge is possible within IGBT safe operating area limits. Tests have been performed during operation on both SPS fast/sl ow extractions. In all the cases the combination of a careful adjustment of the machine parameters (mainly QH and xH), of the kicker settings and of the current provided by the current source result ed in an improvement of the detection efficiency for the neutrino experiments...|$|R
