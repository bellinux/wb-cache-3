50|$|Oil paint dries at {{different}} rates due to the differing drying properties of the constituent pigment. However, everything else being equal, the higher the oil to pigment ratio, the longer the <b>oil</b> <b>binder</b> will take to oxidize, and the more flexible the paint film will be. Conversely, the lower the oil content, the faster the paint dries, and the more brittle it will be. Ignoring this practice, even in some alla prima painting, {{may result in a}} cracked and less durable paint film.|$|E
50|$|Gauguin, {{like some}} of his contemporaries such as Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec, {{employed}} a technique for painting on canvas known as peinture à l'essence. For this, the <b>oil</b> (<b>binder)</b> is drained from the paint and the remaining sludge of pigment is mixed with turpentine. He may have used a similar technique in preparing his monotypes, using paper instead of metal, as it would absorb oil giving the final images a matte appearance he desired. He also proofed some of his existing drawings {{with the aid of}} glass, copying an underneath image onto the glass surface with watercolour or gouache for printing. Gauguin's woodcuts were no less innovative, even to the avant-garde artists responsible for the woodcut revival happening at that time. Instead of incising his blocks with the intent of making a detailed illustration, Gauguin initially chiseled his blocks {{in a manner similar to}} wood sculpture, followed by finer tools to create detail and tonality within his bold contours. Many of his tools and techniques were considered experimental. This methodology and use of space ran parallel to his painting of flat, decorative reliefs.|$|E

The sands have been dried with two methods: in a microwave chamber of 750 W power and, for comparison, with classical method at the temperature of 200 °C for 120 minutes. Tensile and bending strength of the samples have been determined after cooling down. It has been found that microwave drying in the low-power device used for experiments is effective only in case of molding sand prepared with addition of DL binder. The temperature of heated, even up to 32 minutes in a microwave chamber, blocks prepared from the remaining two masses, was insufficient to initiate binding process. The undertaken attempts of binder modification and introduction of additives intensifying microwave heating process allowed for achievement of satisfactory results. It has been found that power of the heating device is the main factor determining efficiency of microwave curing of molding sands containing <b>oil</b> <b>binders.</b> An additional experiment has been conducted on a laboratory workstation allowing for microwave heating of small mass samples with a high output power of magnetron concentrated in a small substrate volume. It has been observed that microwave drying process of molding sands was of dynamic character over a short period of time, not exceeding 120 seconds, thus assuring efficient curing of the sands containing the used <b>oil</b> <b>binders.</b> Therefore, application of devices of properly high microwave output power allows for efficient drying of oil molding sands, while simultaneously assuring the possibility to reduce time and energy consumption necessary for production of foundry cores of proper functional characteristics...|$|R

These depictions vary considerably {{and appear to}} be in no particular order or arrangement. The colors of the paintings vary as well, from red or black monochromes (different shades of a single color) to elaborate polychromes (many various colors). The Chumash made paint from a mixture of mineralized soil, stone mortar, and some kind of liquid binder like blood or oil from animals or mashed seeds. The addition of an <b>oil</b> <b>binder</b> helped to make the paint permanent and waterproof. Orange and red paint contained hematite or iron oxide, while yellow came from limonite, blue and green from copper or serpentine, white from kaolin clays or gypsum, and black from manganese or charcoal. Paint was applied with a person's finger or a brush. Grant organized the types of images depicted in the paintings into two categories: representational and abstract. Representational images include squares, circles and triangles, zigzags, crisscrosses, parallel lines, and pinwheels. Grant noted that in settled villages, abstract paintings were prominent, while the areas occupied by bands of hunting people reveal representational images.|$|E

40|$|Fine coal may be {{separated}} from an aqueous suspension of coal and mineral particles {{through the application of}} a pure oil. The pure oil preferentially wets and agglomerates only the coal, forming a high quality, granular product. However, the use of the pure oil also comes at a relatively high cost and this cost prohibits commercial implementation of this process. In this work a new, economic binder, was introduced. This binder consisted of a high internal phase water-in-oil emulsion which was 95. vol% water and 5. vol% organic. This type of binder was selected as it possessed the hydrophobic surface functionality of oil while the space filling functionality of the binder was primarily satisfied by the dispersed water droplets within the emulsion. The application of this emulsion in the agglomeration process led to a 10 -fold reduction in the organic liquid dosage required to achieve agglomeration as compared a pure <b>oil</b> <b>binder.</b> It was also observed that the agglomeration time required when using the emulsion binder was one order of magnitude less than required when using a pure <b>oil</b> <b>binder.</b> This variation was considered to result from the five orders of magnitude difference in the viscosity of the two binders...|$|E

Fibre Optics Reflectance Spectroscopy (FORS), Micro-Raman, Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (Py- GC/MS) and Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) were used. The original and restoration paint layers were differentiated by a preliminary FORS survey. The pigments were studied with Micro-Raman and the <b>oil</b> <b>binder</b> was characterized by GC/MS.

30|$|Cadmium yellow {{pigments}} commonly {{exist as}} solid solutions where zinc, mercury, or selenium substitutions {{can be used}} to change the pigment’s hue. Yellow cadmium sulfides most frequently occur as a solid solution with zinc sulfide as Cd(1 −x)ZnxS [37]. Micro-Raman spectroscopy has been used to identify these solid solutions, which can have implications about the pigment’s stability. The poorly crystalline nature of the cadmium yellow pigments in this work, and the fluorescence of the <b>oil</b> <b>binder</b> led to cadmium yellow pigments being inferred by the presence of cadmium in yellow regions (SEM-EDX and XRF mapping) and the pigment’s characteristic infrared luminescence.

ATR-FTIR microspectroscopic imaging on a cross-section confirmed they are present in the form of zinc sulphate, the spectra showing a characteristic infrared absorption band at around 1070  cm− 1. Infrared absorption bands at 1530, 1454 and 1397  cm− 1 further indicated that the zinc has reacted with the <b>oil</b> <b>binder</b> to form zinc soaps, which are evident as large translucent inclusions [23].|$|E

40|$|Selective {{agglomeration}} {{using an}} <b>oil</b> <b>binder</b> {{has been considered}} for the processing of fine coal {{many times in the}} past. However, the cost of the <b>oil</b> <b>binder</b> has always proven to be too high for commercial applications. This work revisited the technique of fine coal agglomeration in an effort to create an economically viable process and, thus, increase the overall utilisation of the coal resource. A novel and economic binder which consisted of a water-in-oil emulsion (95 vol% water and 5 vol% oil) was introduced. This emulsion was considered to be an economic alternative to pure oil as it had the potential to drastically reduce the amount of oil required in the process. A reduction was possible as the dispersed water droplets within the emulsion occupied the majority of the void space within the agglomerate; a space which would otherwise have to be filled with oil. In other words, the emulsion possessed an enhanced space-filling functionality. The use of oil as the continuous phase also meant that the necessary hydrophobic surface functionality of the binder was maintained. In this study the selectivity of the new emulsion binder was investigated and compared to the selectivity of a pure kerosene binder. The coal feed used in the study contained particles in the size range of 0 – 2 mm which also afforded the opportunity to study the ability of the emulsion to agglomerate and recover coal over a broad size range. It was found that the selectivity of the emulsion matched that of pure kerosene and consistently resulted in a low, < 15 (%ad), ash product. An analysis of the product agglomerates indicated that the emulsion could agglomerate particles up to 1 mm...|$|E
30|$|The typical {{compounds}} {{indicating a}} drying oil are fatty acids and dicarboxylic acids deriving from the triacylglycerols of the <b>oil</b> <b>binder</b> [33]. The ratio of palmitic to stearic acid (P/S, based on peak {{areas in the}} total ion chromatogram) ranges from 0.87 to 1.9 for the samples tested; while most of these values fall within the range typical for linseed oil (c. 1 – 2), the lower values may be attributable {{to the presence of}} additives such as stearates. Metal stearates have been used in the paint industry to help suspend pigments in oil to prevent separation, {{to reduce the amount of}} oil needed to wet the pigment, and/or to increase the body of the paint by forming a gel with the oil thereby requiring less pigment [18].|$|E

To better understand the chemistry of the vegetable <b>oil</b> <b>binder</b> at different stages of the curing process a range of experiments have been performed including infrared spectroscopy, liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.

Ageing of test specimens under various conditions, including the presence of different pigments, was preliminarily investigated. During ageing, the TAGs and PLs content decreased, whereas the amount of diglycerides, short-chain oxidative products arising from TAGs and PLs, and oxidized TAGs and PLs components increased. The examination of a series of model paint samples gave a clear indication that specific ions produced by oxidative cleavage of PLs and/or TAGs may be used as markers for egg and drying oil-based binders. Their elemental composition and hypothetical structure are also tentatively proposed. Moreover, the simultaneous presence of egg and <b>oil</b> <b>binders</b> can be easily and unambiguously ascertained through the simultaneous occurrence of the relevant specific markers.

A role of Cl− ions is also hypothesized [93, 245]. The formation mechanism of black discolouration products [plattnerite (PbO 2) and galena (PbS)] was recently investigated: no plattnerite could be detected in artificial ageing tests, while the natural ageing of fresco red lead samples yielded calcite CaCO 3, minium Pb 3 O 4, plattnerite PbO 2, anglesite PbSO 4 and gypsum CaSO 4 · 2 H 2 O, with the minium grains being gradually converted to alteration products (plattnerite and anglesite) via a sulphation step followed by solvolytic disproportionation [237, 242].

In order to identify the mechanism underlying these changes, paint layers have been prepared with differing amounts of these white pigments and subjected to accelerated light exposure fading. The resulting unfaded and faded paint layers as well as both the Berlin white pigment, Fe 2 II[FeII(CN) 6], and the partially oxidized Berlin green pigment, {KFeIII[FeII(CN) 6]}x{FeIII[FeIII(CN) 6]} 1 –x, have been characterized by Raman and iron- 57 Mössbauer spectroscopy.

Similarly, the formulations of artists’ tube paints were expanded to include a variety of ingredients, with a drying oil (one rich in polyunsaturated triglycerides) or mixtures of oils as the main component, and additives such as wax, rosin or metal soaps. The tube paint was designed to dry through oxidative cross-linking of the <b>oil</b> <b>binder</b> upon exposure to air and {{in the presence of}} a catalyst, which could be one of the pigments themselves, in a process that could take months to achieve a dry-to-the-touch surface and decades to reach a fully cured status.
