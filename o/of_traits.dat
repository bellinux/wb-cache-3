40|$|One {{signature}} of adaptive radiation {{is a high}} level <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> change early during the diversification process and a plateau {{toward the end of}} the radiation. Although the study of the tempo of evolution has historically been the domain of paleontologists, recently developed phylogenetic tools allow for the rigorous examination <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> evolution in a tremendous diversity of organisms. Enemy-driven adaptive radiation was a key prediction of Ehrlich and Raven's coevolutionary hypothesis [Ehrlich PR, Raven PH (1964) Evolution 18 : 586 - 608], yet has remained largely untested. Here we examine patterns <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> evolution in 51 North American milkweed species (Asclepias), using maximum likelihood methods. We study 7 <b>traits</b> <b>of</b> the milkweeds, ranging from seed size and foliar physiological traits to defense traits (cardenolides, latex, and trichomes) previously shown to impact herbivores, including the monarch butterfly. We compare the fit of simple random-walk models <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> evolution to models that incorporate stabilizing selection (Ornstein-Ulenbeck process), as well as time-varying rates <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> evolution. Early bursts <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> evolution were implicated for 2 traits, while stabilizing selection was implicated for several others. We further modeled the relationship between trait change and species diversification while allowing rates <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> evolution to vary during the radiation. Species-rich lineages underwent a proportionately greater decline in latex and cardenolides relative to species-poor lineages, and the rate <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> change was most rapid early in the radiation. An interpretation of this result is that reduced investment in defensive traits accelerated diversification, and disproportionately so, early in the adaptive radiation of milkweeds...|$|R
40|$|The trait based {{approach}} has been proposed {{as a way to}} reconcile community ecology. Despite recent advances in trait based ecology, such as the development <b>of</b> global <b>trait</b> databases and standardized methodology for trait collections, it remains unclear to what degree traits vary across individuals, species, and communities. In addition, the drivers <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> variation may shed light on the underlying processes that maintain species diversity and community assembly at local to continental scales yet these have been poorly studied. In this study, I examine both the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> variation as well as the patterns <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> variation at local to continental scales {{in order to understand the}} drivers of diversity patterns across environmental gradients. First, I quantified the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> variation at local scales in a dry tropical forest and determined that intraspecific variation is not negligible and can be quite large for compound-leaved species. However, I showed that the sample sizes necessary for quantifying trait variation are tractable and should encourage the adoption <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> variation in trait based ecology. Second, I tested whether climatic variables are predominantly responsible for observed trait variation across dry tropical forests in the Americas. I showed that climatic variability, specifically variability in precipitation, explained a large degree <b>of</b> observed <b>trait</b> variation across dry tropical forests and may provide a unique approach for classifying dry tropical forests based on their inherent degree of climatic seasonality. Third, I quantified patterns <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> variation at continental scales across elevational gradients at high to low latitudes. I showed that climatic variables largely drive patterns <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> variation at high latitudes while biotic factors largely drive patterns <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> variation at low, tropical latitudes. This finding has implications for understanding large-scale patterns of species diversity across elevational and latitudinal gradients. Finally, I apply trait variation to life history theory by quantifying variation in two life history traits (growth and reproduction) in a tropical tree species using a legacy dataset. I showed that variation in these two life history traits is due to both resource availability and allometric related effects on both traits. In sum, this study advances our understanding of the magnitude and underlying drivers <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> variation at local to continental scales...|$|R

40|$|Background and objectives: Low trait {{self-control}} {{constitutes a}} core criterion in various psychiatric disorders. Personality traits such as low self-control are mostly indexed by self-report measures. However, several theorists {{emphasized the importance}} of differentiating between explicit and implicit indices <b>of</b> personality <b>traits,</b> Therefore, the present study examined the unique predictive validity of an implicit measure <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> self-control for spontaneous dysfunctional behavior. Methods: As a measure <b>of</b> implicit <b>trait</b> self-control, we used an irrelevant feature task: a speeded reaction time task comprising a task-relevant stimulus feature (i. e., capital vs. lower case letter type) and a task-irrelevant feature (high vs. low self-control word type). The irrelevant feature had to be ignored, while participants (n = 34) responded to the relevant stimulus feature. However, their response was either congruent or incongruent with the irrelevant stimulus feature, resulting in facilitated or deteriorated task performance. As indicators of trait-related spontaneous dysfunctional behavior, we included indices of frustration tolerance and the preference for short-term reward over meeting long-term goals. We also included two explicit measures <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> self-control: a self-report questionnaire and an explicit self-relevance rating of the implicit task stimuli. Results: Specifically the implicit measure <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> self-control showed predictive validity for the target self-control behaviors. Limitations: The predictive validity of implicit measures <b>of</b> personality <b>traits</b> requires further study in larger, non-student samples. Conclusions: As predicted, the implicit measure <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> self-control showed superior predictive power for spontaneous trait-related behavior. This finding points to the relevance of complementing the routinely used self-report measures with implicit measures <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> self-control. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|In {{addition}} to being a major source of variation, mutation may also function as a mechanism of evolution when there are different probabilities at the molecular level for different mutations to occur, a process known as mutation bias. If two genotypes, for example one with the nucleotide G and another with the nucleotide A in the same position, have the same fitness, but mutation from G to A happens more often than mutation from A to G, then genotypes with A will tend to evolve. Different insertion vs. deletion mutation biases in different taxa can lead to the evolution of different genome sizes. Developmental or mutational biases have also been observed in morphological evolution. For example, according to the phenotype-first theory of evolution, mutations can eventually cause the genetic assimilation <b>of</b> <b>traits</b> that were previously induced by the environment.|$|E
40|$|Factors {{identified}} in investigations <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> structure (e. g., the Big Five) are sometimes understood as explanations or {{sources of the}} covariation <b>of</b> distinct behavioral <b>traits,</b> as when extraversion is suggested to underlie the covariation of assertiveness and sociability. Here, we detail how trait covariation can alternatively be understood as arising from units common to functionalist and process frameworks, such as self-efficacies, expectancies, values, and goals. Specifically, the expected covariation between two behavioral traits should be increased when a specific process variable tends to indicate the functionality <b>of</b> both <b>traits</b> simultaneously. In 2 empirical illustrations, we identify {{a wide array of}} specific process variables associated with several Big Five-related behavioral traits simultaneously, and which are thus likely sources of their covariation. Many of these, such as positive interpersonal expectancies, self-regulatory skills, and preference for order, relate similarly to a broad range <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> perceptions in both studies, and across both self- and peer-reports. We also illustrate how this understanding <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> covariation provides a somewhat novel explanation <b>of</b> why some <b>traits</b> are uncorrelated. As we discuss, a functionalist understanding <b>of</b> <b>trait</b> covariation as arising through functionalist or process variables has implications for many basic issues in personality psychology, such as how personality traits should be measured, mechanisms for personality stability and change, and the nature <b>of</b> personality <b>traits</b> more generally.

5|$|The third mode is parapatric {{speciation}}. This {{is similar}} to peripatric speciation in that a small population enters a new habitat, but differs in {{that there is no}} physical separation between these two populations. Instead, speciation results from the evolution of mechanisms that reduce gene flow between the two populations. Generally this occurs when there has been a drastic change in the environment within the parental species' habitat. One example is the grass Anthoxanthum odoratum, which can undergo parapatric speciation in response to localised metal pollution from mines. Here, plants evolve that have resistance to high levels of metals in the soil. Selection against interbreeding with the metal-sensitive parental population produced a gradual change in the flowering time of the metal-resistant plants, which eventually produced complete reproductive isolation. Selection against hybrids between the two populations may cause reinforcement, which is the evolution <b>of</b> <b>traits</b> that promote mating within a species, as well as character displacement, which is when two species become more distinct in appearance.|$|E

5|$|Biogeographical {{patterns}} and range distributions are explained or predicted through {{knowledge of a}} species' traits and niche requirements. Species have functional traits that are uniquely adapted to the ecological niche. A trait is a measurable property, phenotype, or characteristic of an organism that may influence its survival. Genes {{play an important role}} in the interplay of development and environmental expression <b>of</b> <b>traits.</b> Resident species evolve traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment. This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range. The competitive exclusion principle states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely by living off the same limiting resource; one will always out-compete the other. When similarly adapted species overlap geographically, closer inspection reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements. Some models and empirical studies, however, suggest that disturbances can stabilize the co-evolution and shared niche occupancy of similar species inhabiting species-rich communities. The habitat plus the niche is called the ecotope, which is defined as the full range of environmental and biological variables affecting an entire species.|$|E
