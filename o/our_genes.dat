5|$|In {{a set of}} controversies {{over the}} {{mechanisms}} and interpretation of evolution (what has been called 'The Darwin Wars'), one faction is often named after Dawkins, while the other faction is named after the American palaeontologist Stephen Jay Gould, reflecting the pre-eminence of each as a populariser of the pertinent ideas. In particular, Dawkins and Gould have been prominent commentators in the controversy over sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, with Dawkins generally approving and Gould generally being critical. A typical example of Dawkins's position is his scathing review of Not in <b>Our</b> <b>Genes</b> by Steven Rose, Leon J. Kamin, and Richard C. Lewontin. Two other thinkers who are often considered to be allied with Dawkins on the subject are Steven Pinker and Daniel Dennett; Dennett has promoted a gene-centred view of evolution and defended reductionism in biology. Despite their academic disagreements, Dawkins and Gould {{did not have a}} hostile personal relationship, and Dawkins dedicated a large portion of his 2003 book A Devil's Chaplain posthumously to Gould, who had died the previous year.|$|E
25|$|At {{least some}} of our {{behaviour}} must be influenced by <b>our</b> <b>genes</b> because behaviour depends on the interaction of molecules and neurons in the brain. These interactions {{are a result of}} <b>our</b> <b>genes</b> code, however the influence on behaviour cannot go much further than this. Dawkins likened genes to a computer. They have been pre-programmed to build cells, develop cells and make them work together. Like a computer, the hardware is set in stone, but the software can change how they work, just like our environment. Genes indirectly influence our behaviour as the nervous system and our brain is the intermediary in the transaction decision because it reasons and processes all of the gene instructions into one decision, movement or behaviour. The way our neurons connect is dependent on the environment, learning and experience. This introduces the nurture side of the nature nurture debate.|$|E
25|$|Richard Dawkins {{outlines}} in The Selfish Gene (1976) {{that humans}} are machines made of genes and genes are the grounding for everything we do. The gene-centric view outlines that natural selection, evolution and all behaviour must {{be traced back to}} the survival of competing genes as an extension of Darwin’s theory being the survival of competing individuals. The main goal of individuals, coming from the instinct of <b>our</b> <b>genes,</b> is to reproduce and thrive, where thriving involves protection, conquering competition and future growth. Therefore, everything that we do relates to thriving in our environment above competition, including the way we consume as a form of survival in our environment when simply purchasing the basic physiological needs of food, water and warmth. We also consume to thrive above others, for example in conspicuous consumption where a luxury car represents money and high social status and the application of makeup makes the person and their genes seem more attractive and worthy of passing to offspring.|$|E

30|$|To further {{validate}} <b>our</b> <b>gene</b> ranking list, {{by comparing}} with a previously published list of genes {{that could potentially}} increase iPSC quality (Wu et al., 2014), we selected 10 genes covering different segments in Table S 4 to examine their reprogramming capability. We electroporated each candidate gene’s overexpression vector along with OKS into MEFs and calculated efficiency of iPSC generation. All these genes can promote generation of iPSCs to various extents with a trend that high ranking genes markedly enhanced iPSC generation whereas low ranking genes only had slight effect, {{although there was no}} strict correlation (Fig.  2 D). These validation results suggest that <b>our</b> <b>gene</b> ranking list from the screen can indeed provide a meaningful reference to evaluate each gene’s reprogramming ability in the future.|$|R

The theory of meiosis is that exact replicas of parents' genes are passed to their offspring, with no variation influence from the environment. However genes have a protein wrapping the gene that can influence the gene expression and therefore phenotypes to the environment.

2500|$|Epigenetic marks (epi-marks) are {{temporary}} [...] "switches" [...] {{that control}} how <b>our</b> <b>genes</b> are expressed during gestation and after birth. Moreover, epi-marks [...] are modifications of histone proteins. Epigenetic marks are modifications of the methyl and acetyl groups that bind to DNA histones thereby changing how the proteins function {{and as a}} result, alter gene expression. Epi-marks change how the histones function and as a result, influence the way genes are expressed. Epigenetic marks promote normal sexual development during fetal development; however, they can {{be passed on to}} offspring through the process of mitosis. When they are transferred from one parent to an offspring of the opposite sex, it can contribute to an altered sexual development, thus leading to masculinization of female offspring and feminization of male offspring. However, these epi-marks hold no consistency between individuals in regard to strength and variability.|$|E

2500|$|Neuroethics also {{encompasses}} the ethical {{issues raised by}} neuroscience as it affects {{our understanding of the}} world and of ourselves in the world. [...] For example, if everything we do is physically caused by our brains, which are in turn a product of <b>our</b> <b>genes</b> and our life experiences, how can we be held responsible for our actions? [...] A crime in the United States requires a [...] "guilty act" [...] and a [...] "guilty mind". As neuropsychiatry evaluations have become more commonly used {{in the criminal justice system}} and neuroimaging technologies have given us a more direct way of viewing brain injuries, scholars have cautioned that this could lead to the inability to hold anyone criminally responsible for their actions. In this way, neuroimaging evidence could suggest that there is no free will and each action a person makes is simply the product of past actions and biological impulses that are out of our control. [...] The question of whether and how personal autonomy is compatible with neuroscience ethics and the responsibility of neuroscientists to society and the state is a central one for neuroethics. However, there is some controversy over whether autonomy entails the concept of 'free will' or is a 'moral-political' principle separate from metaphysical quandaries.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) assigns {{approved}} gene symbols {{to human}} loci. There are currently over 33, 000 approved gene symbols, {{the majority of}} which represent protein-coding genes, but we also name other locus types such as non-coding RNAs, pseudogenes and phenotypic loci. Where relevant, the HGNC organise these genes into gene families and groups. The HGNC website [URL] is an online repository of HGNC-approved gene nomenclature and associated resources for human genes, and includes links to genomic, proteomic and phenotypic information. In addition to this, we also have dedicated gene family web pages and are currently expanding and generating more of these pages using data curated by the HGNC and from information derived from external resources that focus on particular gene families.

40|$|Although retroviruses can {{integrate}} their DNA into a {{large number}} of sites in the host genome, factors controlling the specificity of integration remain controversial and poorly understood. To assess the effects of transcriptional activity on integration in vivo, we created quail cell clones containing a construct with a mini-gene cassette, whose expression is controlled by the papilloma virus E 2 protein. From these clones we derived transcriptionally active subclones expressing the wild-type E 2 protein and transcriptionally silent subclones expressing a mutant E 2 protein that binds its target DNA but is unable to activate transcription. By infecting both clones and subclones with avian leukosis virus and using a PCR-based assay to determine viral DNA integration patterns, we were able to assess the effects of both protein binding and transcriptional activity on retroviral DNA integration. Contrary to the hypothesis that transcriptional activity enhances integration, we found an overall decrease in integration into <b>our</b> <b>gene</b> cassette in subclones expressing the wild-type E 2 protein. We also found a decrease in integration into <b>our</b> <b>gene</b> cassette in subclones expressing the mutant E 2 protein, but only into the protein binding region. Based on these findings, we propose that transcriptionally active DNA is not a preferred target for retroviral integration and that transcriptional activity may in fact be correlated with a decrease in integration.
