5000|$|A {{long string}} of [...] "faced" [...] letters (i.e. turned to allow the address to be read) is {{presented}} to a keyboard operator at a coding desk, who types the postcodes onto the envelopes in coloured phosphor dots. The associated machine uses the outward codes in these dots to direct bundles of letters into the correct bags for specific delivery offices. With a machine knowledge of the specific addresses handled by each postal walk at each office, the bundles can be further sorted using the dots of the inward sorting code so that each delivery round receives only its own letters. This feature depends upon {{whether or not it}} is cost effective to second-sort outward letters, and tends to be used only at main sorting offices where high volumes are handled. When postcodes are incomplete or missing, the operator reads the post town name and inserts a code sufficient for <b>outward</b> <b>sorting</b> to the post town where others can further direct it. The mail bags of letter bundles are sent by road, air or train, and eventually by road to the delivery office. At the delivery office the mail that is handled manually is inward sorted to the postal walk that will deliver it, and it is then [...] "set in", sorted into the walk order that allows the deliverer the most convenient progress in the round. The latter process is now being automated, as the rollout of walk sequencing machines continues.|$|E

But, with a few exceptions, the competitors of the incumbent postal operator are active on the upstream segments of the market-preparation, collection, <b>outward</b> <b>sorting</b> and transport of mail products. With the further steps planned in the liberalization process, there are new opportunities to extend competition to the downstream segments of the market - the delivery of mails. In the future, two business models will be possible for the new postal operators: access: where the firm performs the upstream operations and uses the incumbent's delivery network and bypass where the competing firm controls the entire supply chain and delivers mails with its own delivery network. These two options have different impacts on welfare and the profit of the incumbent operator. The choice between access and bypass depends on the entrant's delivery cost relative {{to the cost of}} buying access to the incumbent operator (the access price). In this paper, we derive optimal - welfare maximizing - stamp and access prices for the incumbent operator when these prices {{have an impact on the}} delivery method chosen by the entrant. We show how prices should be re-balanced when the entry method is considered as endogenous i. e. affected by the incumbent's prices...|$|E

But, with a few exceptions, the competitors of the incumbent postal operator are currently active on the upstream segments of the market -preparation, collection, <b>outward</b> <b>sorting</b> and transport of mail products. With the further steps planed in the liberalization process, there are new opportunities to extend competition to the downstream segments of the market -the delivery of mails. In the future, two business model will be possible for the new postal operators: (1) access: where the firm perform the upstream operations and uses the incumbent's delivery network and (2) bypass where the competing firm controls the entire supply chain and delivers mails with its own delivery network. These two options have a different impact on both the welfare and the profit of the historical operator. In particular, bypass raises severe concerns for the financing of the universal service obligations. The choice between access and bypass depends on the entrant's delivery cost relative {{to the cost of}} buying access to the incumbent operator (the access price).

As for Miss Roxy, if you have ever {{carefully}} examined a chestnut-burr, you will remember that, hard as it is to handle, no plush of downiest texture can exceed the satin smoothness of the fibres which line its heart. There are a class of people in New England who betray the uprising of the softer feelings of our nature only by an increase of <b>outward</b> asperity--a <b>sort</b> of bashfulness and shyness leaves them no power of expression for these unwonted guests of the heart--they hurry them into inner chambers and slam the doors upon them, as if they were vexed at their appearance.|$|R
