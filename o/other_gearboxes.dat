40|$|Abstract- Even {{though there}} is a number of {{condition}} monitoring and analysis techniques, researchers are in search of a simple and easy way to monitor vibration of a gearbox, which is an important power transmission component in any machinery. In gearboxes, load fluctuations on the gearbox and gear defects are two major sources of vibration. Further, at times, measurement of vibration in the gearbox is not easy because of the inaccessibility in mounting the vibration transducers. Techniques such as wear and debris analysis, vibration monitoring and acoustic emissions require accessibility to the gearbox either to collect samples or to mount the transducers on or near the gearbox. But dusty environment, background noise, structural vibration etc. may hamper the quality and efficiency of these techniques. Hence, {{there is a need to}} monitor the gearbox away from its actual location, which can be achieved through Motor current signature analysis (MCSA). An efficient and new but non intrusive method to detect the fluctuation in gear load may be the motor current signature analysis (MCSA). Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) has been the most recent addition as a nonintrusive and easy to measure condition monitoring technique. This analysis system can be used for measuring the characteristics for a perfectly working gearbox and use the data as a standard for measuring faults and defects in <b>other</b> <b>gearboxes.</b> Index Terms- Motor current signature analysis, Condition monitoring, load fluctuations, Gear defects.

40|$|To {{increase}} {{reliability and}} efficiency, standard aircraft components are being replaced with more electric subsystems aimed to reduce weight, conserve space, and improve energy management. One {{application of this}} process replaces standard hydraulic actuators used in flap or aileron movements with electromechanical actuators powered by an external generator. During different types of return movements, the electromechanical actuator will produce regenerative power that flows back through the generator and pulses into the engine-gearbox subsystem. The regenerative power, defined by characteristic amplitude, frequency, and other pulse attributes, coupled with the driving force produced by the engine may dramatically impact the performance and life of the gearbox. Steady state and transient subsystem models have been developed in the MATLAB/Simulink® environment to simulate gearbox behavior subject to incurred engine loads, regenerative power loads, and other dynamic phenomena such as backlash present in the gear interactions. Employing a lumped inertia approach, derived equations of motion incorporate damping and stiffness parameters pertaining to bearings, shafts, and gear mesh interactions. Particularly sensitive {{to the amount of}} damping acting at the gear mesh, the contact force and inter-gear dynamics are modeled by three separate methods of contact force calculation. The models and development process utilized in this study can be used as practical gearbox design and scaling tools for <b>other</b> <b>gearbox</b> systems. Application of regenerative energy causes instantaneous oscillations of the angular velocity and transient torque profiles of the gearbox components and connecting shafts. Several shafts experience high stress fluctuations and absolute reversal of rotation that possibly act as sources leading to accelerated fatigue failure. Depending on the applied method of contact force calculation, instances of gear backlash at engine start-up conditions are experienced. Regenerative transients cause variations in the amount of inter-gear penetration, but backlash never occurs for any gear pair operating at the provided conditions...|$|R

40|$|In {{domestic}} {{automotive industry}} {{the need for}} transition from transmission with manual control to automatic gearboxes (GB) emerged long ago. Regarding the leading foreign manufacturers (Allison, ZF, Eaton, etc.), an experience in design of automatic transmissions {{and the level of}} technological development is incomparably small. Thus, to have an informed choice of the gearbox structure types and control system is a relevant problem. Application efficiency of this or <b>other</b> <b>gearbox</b> depends both on its adaptability to the actual operating conditions and on the quality of transition refinement. This paper analyzes the special features of the gear change process in the most common types of automatic gearboxes. Constructive feasibilities of an "ideal" gear change (without power loss) and strategies for gear shifting are compared. The paper offers an overview of common problems when achieving these goals and the ways to solve them. An automatic transmission of the particular type used in the wheeled vehicles under off-road conditions determines the probability of maintaining their mobility. This is due to the phenomenon of wheel`s breakdown to slipping caused by sharp increase of torque on the wheel. Planetary hydromechanical transmissions (AT) provide continuous input torque to the wheels, but they are expensive and difficult to manufacture and use. Besides, to provide a high number of density ratios in them is more complicated than in the automated and manual transmissions (AMT). This is important when moving long in the lower gears under difficult conditions. Compared with AT dual clutch transmissions due to design features require even more precise and fast control system of actuators and engine. Automation of constant-mesh or synchromesh transmissions provides a significant reduction in the duration of interruption in torque delivery. If {{it is not enough to}} increase mobility in the harsh conditions, a rational choice is to use a transmission type of TCCT (torque converter – clutch – (constant-mesh or synchromesh) transmission). Adding the torque converter to AMT increases the durability of clutch and synchronizers. It reduces the amount of gear changes and duration of interruption in torque delivery. Thus, the cost and repair complexity of such a transmission is much lower than those of AT. For almost 15 years there were no domestic scientific publications about economically perspective TCCT transmission. The fully automatic TCCT has been never investigated in domestic science...|$|R

Four of the crew, two drivers (one of whom also acted as commander; he operated the brakes, the <b>other</b> the primary <b>gearbox)</b> and two [...] "gearsmen" [...] (one for the secondary gears of each track) were needed to control direction and speed, the latter never more than a walking pace. As the noise inside was deafening, the driver, after setting the primary gear box, communicated with the gearsmen with hand signals, first getting their attention by hitting the engine block with a heavy spanner. For slight turns, the driver could use the steering tail: an enormous contraption dragged behind the tank consisting of two large wheels, each of which could be blocked by pulling a steel cable causing the whole vehicle to slide in the same direction. If the engine stalled, the gearsmen would use the starting handle - a large crank between the engine and the gearbox. Many of these vehicles broke down in the heat of battle making them an easy target for German gunners. There was no wireless (radio); communication with command posts was by means of two pigeons, which had their own small exit hatch in the sponsons, or by runners.

The <b>gearbox</b> uses small and large gears (Fig.  2 b at bottom left), with gear ratio of ca. 1 : 5 and 1 : 24, respectively. The small gear contains one set of planetary gear with the ratio of 4.91, and the large gear contains two sets of planetary gear, with the ratio of 24.1 (=  4.912, Fig.  1). The gearbox contains either one large gear, or combination of the large and the small gears connected coaxially, to shift the gear ratio from 1 : 5 to 1 : 118 (=  4.913). Usually, we use gear ratio from 1 : 24 to 1 : 118 and the gearshift takes about 10  s. A reaction bar (Fig.  2 c) is necessary to prevent the gearbox from rotating when driving an increment borer.

40|$|In {{helicopters}} and <b>other</b> rotorcraft, the <b>gearbox</b> {{is a major}} source of noise and vibration (N&V). The two N&V excitation mechanisms are the relative displacements between mating gears (transmission errors) and the friction associated with sliding between gear teeth. Historically, transmission errors have been minimized via improved manufacturing accuracies and tooth modifications. Yet, at high torque loads, noise levels are still relatively high though transmission errors might be somewhat minimal. This suggests that sliding friction is indeed a dominant noise source for high power density rotorcraft gearboxes. In reality, friction source mechanism is associated with surface roughness, lubrication regime properties, time-varying friction forces/torques and gear-mesh interface dynamics. Currently, the nature of these mechanisms is not well understood, while there is a definite need for analytical tools that incorporate sliding resistance and surface roughness, and predict their effects on the vibro- acoustic behavior of gears. Toward this end, an experiment was conducted to collect sound and vibration data on the NASA Glenn Gear-Noise Rig. Three iterations of the experiment were accomplished: Iteration 1 tested a baseline set of gears to establish a benchmark. Iteration 2 used a gear-set with low surface asperities to reduce the sliding friction excitation. Iteration 3 incorporated low viscosity oil with the baseline set of gears to examine the effect of lubrication. The results from this experiment will contribute to a two year project in collaboration with the Ohio State University to develop the necessary mathematical and computer models for analyzing geared systems and explain key physical phenomena seen in experiments. Given the importance of sliding friction in the gear dynamic and vibro-acoustic behavior of rotorcraft gearboxes, there is considerable potential for research & developmental activities. Better models and understanding will lead to quiet and reliable gear designs, as well as the selection of optimal manufacturing processes...|$|R
40|$|Introduction One of {{the ways}} used for {{minimizing}} the cost of maintenance and repairs of rotating industrial equipment is condition monitoring using acoustic analysis. One {{of the most important}} problems which always have been under consideration in industrial equipment application is confidence possibility. Each dynamic, electrical, hydraulic or thermal system has certain characteristics which show the normal condition of the machine during function. Any changes of the characteristics can be a signal of a problem in the machine. The aim of condition monitoring is system condition determination using measurements of the signals of characteristics and using this information for system impairment prognostication. There are a lot of ways for condition monitoring of different systems, but sound analysis is accepted and used extensively as a method for condition investigation of rotating machines. The aim of this research is the design and construction of considered gearbox and using of obtaining data in frequency and time spectrum in order to analyze the sound and diagnosis. Materials and Methods This research was conducted at the department of mechanical biosystem workshop at Aboureihan College at Tehran University in February 15 th. 2015. In this research, in order to investigate the trend of diagnosis and gearbox condition, a system was designed and then constructed. The sound of correct and damaged gearbox was investigated by audiometer and stored in computer for data analysis. Sound measurement was done in three pinions speed of 749, 1050 and 1496 rpm and for correct gearboxes, damage of the fracture of a tooth and a tooth wear. Gearbox design and construction: In order to conduct the research, a gearbox with simple gearwheels was designed according to current needs. Then mentioned gearbox and its accessories were modeled in CATIA V 5 -R 20 software and then the system was constructed. Gearbox is a machine that is used for mechanical power transition from a productive source of power to a consumer, for torque meeting and for rotating speed needed for the consumer. In fact, gearbox is an interfere between power source and power consumer which produces a flexible communication between power source and power consumer. Needing to a gearbox as a machine which can generate harmony as an interface is unavoidable due to lack of harmony of torque and rotating speed of production source of power. So necessary calculations in order to attain to technical characteristics of gearwheels, bearings, shaft dimensions and <b>other</b> accessories of <b>gearbox</b> were done. This gearbox is from kinds of simple gearwheel which its input and output shaft are parallel to each other. Main accessories of gearbox are: 1. crust 2. shaft 3. gearwheel 4. thorn 5. bearing 6. cover. All of the design parameters were calculated and considered in designing of all of the accessories of gearbox. Electromotor rotating calibration: For this aim, a light-contact telemeter in model of Lutron was used as contact. Acoustic module of electro motor: A module was constructed in order to prevent from sound waves interaction resulting from an electromotor function with waves of gearbox function. Three layers of sound absorbent including common felt with 1 mm width, polyethylene foam with 15 mm width and shoulder foam egg with 35 mm width were used for the module insulation. Material used for the body of this module was MDF. Based on field measurement, level of electromotor sound decrement using the acoustic module was 20 dB. Investigated malfunctions in this research are relevant to gearwheel with one tooth fracture, one worn tooth and one tooth fracture and other worn tooth. Collection and storage of acoustic data: In this research, an audiometer in model of HT- 157 made in Italy in order to obtain acoustic data and a laptop with a model of Lenovo-G 550 for data storage and processing was used. Cool Edit Pro 2. 0 software was used for data processing. Data storage was in PCM format and MATLAB R 2014 a software used for data processing. Data processing: Signal processing method in the frequency domain is used in order to reveal the defects. Fast Fourier Transform: Fast Fourier Transform FFT for application in electronic equipment specially analyzers have great importance. In this condition, sampling number is chosen exponentially as 2 N which decreases the calculation volume significantly. Determination of defect kind of gearwheel using frequency spectrum analysis: In mentioned gearwheel, errors were generated synthetically. Defect kind of these errors was generated in separate gearwheels in order to investigate the defects more precisely and a gearwheel was considered as control gearwheel. Despite of this, the sound of all of the gearwheels in correct condition was stored. Results and Discussion Comparison of processed acoustic signals from gearwheels of gearbox in two correct and incorrect conditions was indicative of gearwheel involvement, frequency, their harmony and the changes resulted from defects. Gearwheel defect detection tests showed that at the speeds of 1496, 1050 and 749 rpm, investigated defects are recognizable with a comparison of the frequency spectrum of obtained signals in correct and incorrect conditions and according to the involvement frequency of gearwheel, its harmony and sided spectrum. Results of the frequency spectrum of signal analysis in speed of 1496 rpm pinion showed the defect of one tooth fracture in involvement frequency of gearwheels by 489, 350 and 249 Hz respectively which became apparent with a mentioned frequency domain increment. A worn tooth defect in a gearwheel was completely determinable as sided bands with equal distance around gearwheel involvement frequency in the signal frequency determination of the speeds of 1496 and 105 rpm pinion, but became a bit harder in less speeds. Investigation of frequency spectrum of acoustic signal resulted from gearwheel, is indicative of the ability of this method in gearbox condition investigation with high precision and minimum time. So the gearbox condition investigation is reached by investigation of the frequency spectrum of acoustic signal resulted from gearwheel. Conclusions In current research, acquisitive signals resulted from produced sound waves of constructed gearwheel were used for investigation and diagnosis. Recorded signal in time domain and processed frequency and exploited characteristics of signal in frequency domain for diagnosis were analyzed. Obtained results of this research can be summarized as follow: 1. Precision level in the diagnosis decreased by increasing in pinion speed. 2. There will be a decrement in gearwheel diagnosis after defects integration and signal behavior won’t be completely similar to the defect as individual. 3. Proper placement of audiometer is effective in diagnosis trend. 4. In frequency spectrum of obtained signals, particle velocity level is more efficient in diagnosis than the sound pressure level...|$|R
