5|$|From {{its opening}} on November 20, 1978, until December 11, 1979, the <b>Orange</b> Line was co-aligned with the Blue Line from National Airport to Stadium-Armory, with the <b>Orange</b> Line {{continuing}} east from Stadium-Armory to New Carrollton. Beginning December 1, 1979, the <b>Orange</b> Line diverged westward from Rosslyn to Ballston.

5|$|The club is {{associated}} with two very different colour schemes—white and black (first permanently adopted in 1920), and <b>orange,</b> navy and white (first used in 1973, and worn by the team as of the 2015–16 season). Luton mainly wore a combination of light blue and white before 1920, when white shirts and black shorts were first adopted. These colours were retained for over half a century, with the colour of the socks varying between white and black, until Luton changed to <b>orange,</b> navy and white {{at the start of}} the 1973–74 season. Luton began playing in white shirts, shorts and socks in 1979, with the <b>orange</b> and navy motif reduced to trim; navy shorts were adopted in 1984. This palette was retained until the 1999–2000 season, when the team played in <b>orange</b> shirts and blue shorts. From 2000 to 2008, Luton returned to white shirts and black shorts; <b>orange</b> was included as trim until 2007. The white, navy and <b>orange</b> palette favoured in the 1980s was brought back in 2008, following the results of a club poll, but a year later the colours were changed yet again, this time to a predominantly <b>orange</b> strip with white shorts. Navy shorts were readopted in 2011. Luton are wearing <b>orange</b> shirts, navy shorts and white socks during the 2015–16 season.|$|E

30|$|With {{respect to}} product quality and {{consumer}} preferences, Rudolf (2015) shows {{that despite the}} fact that other competitors (e.g. Turkey and Greece) have a more favourable geographical position with regard to their proximity to the Russian market, the competitiveness of Egyptian <b>oranges</b> on the Russian market relies primarily on their quality and price. Soliman (2013) assessed the competitiveness of Egyptian fresh <b>oranges</b> in a number of European markets, including Russia, using the global value chain analysis approach (GVCA) based on interviews with buyers and key stakeholders in these markets. His results suggest that Egyptian <b>oranges</b> are perceived to be of higher quality than <b>oranges</b> from Turkey and Morocco. Moreover, unlike many other competing countries and due to favourable climatic conditions, Egyptian Valencia <b>oranges</b> do not normally experience the “re-greening phenomenon” which breaks down the colour dyes that give <b>oranges</b> their normal colour, causing a greenish tint, i.e. the reappearance of chlorophyll in mature <b>oranges</b> (Abu Hatab and Nsanimana 2016). Increased health concerns among consumers in Russian and other importing markets and fears of the use of chemicals to re-colour <b>oranges</b> therefore result in a high demand for Egyptian <b>oranges</b> on the Russian market.|$|R

5|$|The {{place name}} <b>Orange</b> has a {{separate}} etymology. The Roman-Celtic settlement {{was founded in}} 36 or 35 BC and originally named Arausio, after a Celtic water god. The Principality of <b>Orange</b> was named for this place {{and not for the}} color. Some time after the sixteenth century, though, the color <b>orange</b> was adopted as a canting symbol of the House of Orange-Nassau. The color eventually came to be associated with Protestantism, due to participation by the House of <b>Orange</b> on the Protestant side in the French Wars of Religion and the Dutch Eighty Years' War.|$|E
40|$|Consumer {{demand for}} ready-to-eat-products has stimulated the {{development}} of new processing techniques to prepare fresh-cut fruit and vegetables. The aim {{of this study was to}} propose a peeling method for 'Pera' <b>oranges</b> (Citrus sinensis [L. ] Osb.) by using a hydrothermal treatment and to determine its influence on the respiratory activity, physicochemical and sensorial characteristics, as well as on the peeling time. Cooled <b>oranges</b> (6 ºC) were immersed in heated water (50 ºC) for eight minutes and then, peeled and stored at 6 ºC. The internal fruit temperatures taken at 1 and 3 cm depths (from fruit surface) were 15 ºC and 10 ºC, respectively, at the end of the hydrothermal treatment. Non-hydrothermally-treated peeled <b>oranges</b> were used as control. The peeling time for treated <b>oranges</b> was 3. 2 times as short as the time used for the control. The yield of marketable <b>oranges</b> was 95 % for hydrothermally-treated <b>oranges</b> versus 60 % for control. The respiratory activity of hydrothermally-treated <b>oranges</b> was greater than that of control <b>oranges</b> only during the first hour after peeling. The hydrothermal treatment influenced neither the physicochemical quality (given by soluble solids, titratable acidity and ascorbic acid content) nor fruit flavor. <b>Oranges</b> peeled with the aid of the hydrothermal treatment had better appearance. The hydrothermal treatment makes the peeling of <b>oranges</b> easier and does not affect their respiratory activity or their physicochemical and sensorial qualities...|$|R
