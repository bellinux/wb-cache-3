500|$|There {{are many}} {{accounts}} of Johnson suffering from bouts {{of depression and}} what Johnson thought might be madness. As Walter Jackson Bate puts it, [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> of literary history is that its most compelling and authoritative symbol of common sense—of the strong, imaginative grasp of concrete reality—should have begun his adult life, {{at the age of}} twenty, in a state of such intense anxiety and bewildered despair that, at least from his own point of view, it seemed the onset of actual insanity". To overcome these feelings, Johnson tried to constantly involve himself with various activities, but this did not seem to help. Taylor said that Johnson [...] "at one time strongly entertained thoughts of Suicide". Boswell claimed that Johnson [...] "felt himself overwhelmed with an horrible melancholia, with perpetual irritation, fretfulness, and impatience; and with a dejection, gloom, and despair, which made existence misery".|$|E
500|$|In 1974 {{the rock}} singer Alan Price {{released}} [...] the [...] "Jarrow Song", which helped {{to raise awareness}} of the events of 1936 among a new generation. Among dramatisations based on the Jarrow March is a play, Whistling at the Milestones (1977) by Alex Glasgow, and an opera, Burning Road (1996), by Will Todd and Ben Dunwell. In what Perry describes as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> surrounding the march, the opera was performed in Durham Cathedral in May 1997, in retrospective defiance of the bishop who had condemned the march. The town of Jarrow contains several commemorations, including a steel relief sculpture by Vince Rea at the new railway station, a tile mural designed by local schoolchildren, and a bronze sculpture—"The Spirit of the Crusade" [...] by Graham Ibbeson—in the town centre. Buildings and street names bear the names of Wilkinson and Riley. Perry writes that [...] "In Jarrow, landscape and memory have fused together, just as the red hot rivets once fastened great sheets of steel in Palmer's Yard".|$|E

40|$|Comprehension is an {{important}} factor in <b>the</b> functioning <b>of</b> <b>irony.</b> Readers who are unaware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> in an utterance are "sheep," whereas readers who understand <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> are "wolves" (Gibbs & Izett, 2005). Factors that may impact on <b>the</b> attitude toward <b>irony</b> not only include comprehension, but agreement (agreeing with the position taken in the utterance or not) and group membership (belonging to <b>the</b> target <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> or not) as well. In an experiment, participants were asked to evaluate either ironic prejudices against women or ironic prejudices against men. The attitude toward the utterance and text is more positive when participants recognize the ironic intention, agree with the statement, and are not <b>the</b> members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> targeted group. These results imply that studies into <b>the</b> pragmatic effects <b>of</b> verbal irony should consider these 3 factors. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

2500|$|In Wind, Whales and Whisky, Silver Donald Cameron {{discusses}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> he sees {{about life}} in Cape Breton. On the one hand, the island seems poor with chronic unemployment, but on the other, its rural inhabitants have access to abundant and delicious food such as apples, cranberries, fish, deer, moose and the produce from their gardens. After describing [...] "the most unbelievably wonderful meal of the voyage"—lobster and grey sole baked in the oven with tinned mushroom soup accompanied by scalloped potatoes and broccoli, Cameron writes: [...] "I love living in a depressed region, I thought. One lives so well." [...] In a chapter entitled, Good People in Bad Times, Cameron outlines the troubles of industrial Cape Breton including the long decline of two of its economic mainstays, coal mining and steel making. [...] "It is a hard place to make a living," [...] he writes, [...] "but {{it is a wonderful}} place to live." ...|$|E
2500|$|Edith Terry, {{author of}} How Asia Got Rich, {{said that because}} Japanese people are [...] "mastering" [...] a [...] "Western game" [...] people have some pride {{and at the same}} time feel {{insecurity}} because the [...] "game" [...] is on [...] "Western terms" [...] rather than [...] "Japanese terms." [...] The standard presentation of Japanese names in English differs from the standard presentations of modern Chinese names, since modern Chinese names are usually not reversed to fit the western order in English, except when the Chinese person is living or traveling outside of China. The convention regarding Japanese names also differs from Korean names, which are usually in Korean order unless the Korean person is abroad. Power wrote that the difference between the treatment of Japanese names and of Chinese and Korean names often results in confusion. Terry wrote, [...] "it was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> of the late twentieth century that Japan remained stranded in the formal devices underlining its historical quest for equality with the West, while China set its own terms, in language as in big-power politics." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>the</b> {{different types}} <b>of</b> echoing used in actual examples <b>of</b> verbal <b>irony.</b> <b>The</b> examples all contain an appositional structure, indicating an equivalence relation.

2500|$|The usual {{presentation}} of Chinese names in English {{differs from the}} usual presentations of modern Japanese names, since modern Japanese names are usually reversed to fit the western order in English. In English the {{presentation of}} Chinese names is {{similar to those of}} Korean names. Edith Terry, author of How Asia Got Rich, said that [...] "it was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> of the late twentieth century that Japan remained stranded in the formal devices underlining its historical quest for equality with the West, while China set its own terms, in language as in big-power politics." [...] As of 1989, Pinyin became the preferred romanization system in works discussing contemporary China, while English-language books relevant to Japanese history still used the Wade–Giles system to romanize Chinese names more often than other romanization systems. As of 1993, Wade–Giles was still used in Taiwan. Unlike mainland Chinese, Taiwanese people usually place a dash between the two characters of the given name, similar to Korean names. This is also the case for the standard styling of Hong Kong Chinese names, where the given name is hyphenated. Names of Malaysian Chinese and Singaporean Chinese people are often expressed in three parts.|$|E
2500|$|The play, however, doesn’t simply {{depict the}} fall of one order, it also depicts the rise of another; [...] "How the nation might have {{remained}} true to itself is signified by the words and deeds of Talbot. What she {{is in danger of}} becoming is signified by the shortcomings of the French, failings that crop up increasingly amongst Englishman [...] also manifest are an English decline towards French effeminacy and the beginnings of reliance upon fraud and cunning rather than manly courage and straightforward manly virtue." [...] If the old mode of honourable conduct is specifically represented by Talbot and Henry V, the new mode of duplicity and Machiavellianism is represented by Joan, who employs a type of warfare with which Talbot is simply unable to cope. This is seen most clearly when she sneaks into Rouen and subsequently refuses to face Talbot in a battle. Talbot finds this kind of behaviour incomprehensible and utterly dishonourable. As such, he finds himself fighting an enemy who uses tactics he is incapable of understanding; with the French using what he sees as unconventional methods, he proves unable to adapt. This represents one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> in the play's depiction of chivalry; it is the very resoluteness of Talbot's honour and integrity, his insistence in preserving an old code abandoned by all others, which ultimately defeats him; his inability to adjust means he becomes unable to function in the newly established 'dishonourable' context. As such, the play is not entirely nostalgic about chivalry; [...] "so often the tenets of chivalry are mocked by word and action. The play is full of moments of punctured aristocratic hauteur." ...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{commentators}} have attended to dramatic and ironic aspects of Plato’s Republic. But a more sustained examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relation between <b>irony</b> and <b>the</b> exchanges <b>of</b> Socrates and Glaucon is required because a crucial purpose and presentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> have largely gone unnoticed. I argue that Socrates employs irony {{in part to}} parody Glaucon’s extremism and that he does so to exhort Glaucon to think critically. I examine how Socrates uses the term makaria (blessedness) primarily ironically and pedagogically. A possible reason for this use of makaria is that aspects of Kallipolis are a parody of Glaucon that aim to instruct Glaucon intellectually...|$|R

60|$|In 1877 Mr. Gladstone penned {{words to}} which later events gave an only too {{striking}} verification. “Territorial questions,” he said, “are {{not to be}} disposed of by arbitrary limits; we cannot enjoy the luxury of taking Egyptian soil by pinches. We may seize an Aden and a Perim, where is no already formed community of inhabitants, and circumscribe a tract at will. But our first site in Egypt, be it by larceny or be it by emption, will be the almost certain egg of a North African empire, that will grow and grow until another Victoria and another Albert, titles of the lake-sources of the White Nile, come within our borders; and till we finally join hands across the equator with Natal and Cape Town, {{to say nothing of}} the Transvaal and the Orange River on the south, or of Abyssinia or Zanzibar to be swallowed by way of viaticum on our journey.”(45) It was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> in which every active statesman’s life abounds, that the author of that forecast should have been fated to take his country over its first marches towards this uncoveted destination.|$|E
60|$|There is {{no doubt}} of the stir made by Cabot's {{discovery}} on his safe return to England. He was in London by August of 1497, and he became at once the object of eager curiosity and interest. 'He is styled the Great Admiral,' wrote a Venetian resident in London, 'and vast honour is paid to him. He dresses in silk, and the English run after him like mad people.' The sunlight of royal favour broke over him in a flood: even Henry VII proved generous. The royal accounts show that, on August 10, 1497, the king gave ten pounds 'to him that found the new isle.' A few months later the king granted to his 'well-beloved John Cabot, of the parts of Venice, an annuity of twenty pounds sterling,' to be paid out of the customs of the port of Bristol. The king, too, was lavish in his promises of help for a new expedition. Henry's imagination had evidently been fired {{with the idea of}} an Oriental empire. A contemporary writer tells us that Cabot was to have ten armed ships. At Cabot's request, the king conceded to him all the prisoners needed to man this fleet, saving only persons condemned for high treason. It is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> of history that on the first pages of its annals the beautiful new world is offered to the criminals of Europe.|$|E

60|$|One evening two {{or three}} days later I {{returned}} from the office to gaze up at my house, to realize suddenly that it would be impossible for me to live there, in those great, empty rooms, alone; and I told Maude that I would go to the Club--during her absence. I preferred to keep up the fiction that her trip would only be temporary. She forbore from contradicting me, devoting herself efficiently to the task of closing the house, making it seem, somehow, a rite,--the final rite in her capacity as housewife. The drawing-room was shrouded, and the library; the books wrapped neatly in paper; a smell of camphor pervaded the place; the cheerful schoolroom was dismantled; trunks and travelling bags appeared. The solemn butler packed my clothes, and I arranged for a room at the Club in the wing that recently had been added for the accommodation of bachelors and deserted husbands. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> of those days was that the children began to suggest again possibilities of happiness I had missed--especially Matthew. With all his gentleness, the boy seemed to have a precocious understanding of the verities, and the capacity for suffering which as a child I had possessed. But he had more self-control. Though he looked forward to the prospect of new scenes and experiences with the anticipation natural to his temperament, I thought he betrayed at moments a certain intuition as to what was going on.|$|E
60|$|His {{vision and}} {{his sense of}} access to God had given a new courage to his mind; in these moods of {{enlightenment}} {{he could see the}} world as a comprehensible ball, he could see history as an understandable drama. He had always been on the verge of realizing before, he realized now, the two entirely different and antagonistic strands that interweave in the twisted rope of contemporary religion; the old strand of the priest, the fetishistic element of the blood sacrifice and the obscene rite, the element of ritual and tradition, of the cult, the caste, the consecrated tribe; and interwoven with this so closely as to be scarcely separable in any existing religion was the new strand, the religion of the prophets, the unidolatrous universal worship of the one true God. Priest religion is the antithesis to prophet religion. He saw that the founders of all the great existing religions of the world had been like himself--only that he was a weak and commonplace man with no creative force, and they had been great men of enormous initiative--men reaching out, and never with a complete definition, from the old kind of religion to the new. The Hebrew prophets, Jesus, whom the priests killed when Pilate would have spared him, Mohammed, Buddha, had this much in common that they had sought to lead men from temple worship, idol worship, from rites and ceremonies and the rule of priests, from anniversaryism and sacramentalism, into a direct and simple relation to the simplicity of God. Religious progress had always been liberation and simplification. But none of these efforts had got altogether clear. The organizing temper in men, the disposition to dogmatic theorizing, the distrust of the discretion of the young by the wisdom of age, the fear of indiscipline which is so just in warfare and so foolish in education, the tremendous power of the propitiatory tradition, had always caught and crippled every new gospel before it had run a score of years. Jesus for example gave man neither a theology nor a church organization; His sacrament was an innocent feast of memorial; but the fearful, limited, imitative men he left to carry on his work speedily restored all these three abominations of the antiquated religion, theology, priest, and sacrifice. Jesus indeed, caught into identification with the ancient victim of the harvest sacrifice and turned from a plain teacher into a horrible blood bath and a mock cannibal meal, was surely the supreme feat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> of chance....|$|E
