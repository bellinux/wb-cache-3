On examination by Russell, Mrs Wilson stated that she thought she saw Gordon-Cumming cheat twice by adding additional counters to his stake. When Clarke cross-examined her, he asked if anyone had placed a stake of £15. Mrs Wilson stated that only her husband had placed such an amount, but Wilson had not played on either night as he disliked both the game and high-stakes gambling. Havers, Grayson and Shankland consider it [...] "rather shocking really, considering that she had sworn to tell the truth,... to find her coming <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>this...</b> lie spoken, apparently, with the complete self-assurance that {{the other members of}} her family had shown".|$|E

They decided that it would affect only {{one side of his}} body. According to Byrne, the cast bonded quickly during rehearsals. Del Toro worked with Alan Shaterian to develop Fenster's distinctive, almost unintelligible speech patterns. According to the actor, the source of his character's unusual speech patterns came from the realization that [...] "the purpose of my character was to die."

Accordingly, they decided {{to proceed with the}} concert as planned. However, according to Ezratty, many of the crew were not in agreement and wanted to walk off the set. He said, [...] "The guys from the American sound company were not at all enamored with being <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> band. I can remember them saying, [...] "Oh, we could be out with Asia right now!' So they decided to pull the plug on it. They said, 'It's a matter of safety. We're going to pull the system down and we're not doing to do it.'" [...] McGuinness dissuaded the crew with an impromptu speech, a moment on which Ezratty recollected: [...] "Paul called everybody down into the bowels of Red Rocks where they fed everybody. It was cold and raining and everybody was shivering, and Paul made a speech, saying in no uncertain terms {{that we were going to}} proceed as one, that the band's entire livelihood was riding on this, and that this was one of the most pivotal moments in their career. He said that if it were deemed that this show was in any way possible to happen, it was going to happen, and it was not going to be tolerated that anybody would do anything but add their effort to a successful and positive outcome I just stood there and went, [...] "This is so cool.

2500|$|After {{the success}} of Half-Life, the team worked on mods, spin-offs, and sequels, {{including}} Half-Life 2. All current Valve games are built on its Source engine. The company has developed six game series: Half-Life, Team Fortress, Portal, Counter-Strike, Left 4 Dead and Day of Defeat. Valve is noted for its support of its games' modding community, most prominently, Counter-Strike, Team Fortress, and Day of Defeat. Valve has branched <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> tradition to continue developing Dota 2 as the standalone sequel to the [...] mod. Each of these games began as a third-party mod that Valve purchased and developed into a full game. They also distribute community mods on Steam. Valve announced the Source 2 engine in March 2015, later porting the entirety of Dota 2 to the engine in September of that year.|$|E

Huntley and Richardson married on January 30, 1910, 23 {{years after their}} first meeting. For 18 years before the marriage, she had lived with an intense devotion to what she sincerely {{believed to be a}} great work for humanity. But a short time before her death, she became aware of TK's real nature, the awful consequences of his destructive influences, together with her own part in carrying them <b>out.</b> <b>With</b> <b>this</b> recognition, for several days, she wept, and finally on January 28, 1912, she began to experience a severe headache, a few hours later lapsing into unconsciousness which lasted nearly four days.

2500|$|When news of {{this crisis}} reached Athens, the city found itself facing a desperate situation. [...] To {{challenge}} the superior Peloponnesian fleet, the Athenians had only 40 ready triremes, {{and most of the}} experienced crews were at sea with Conon. [...] To rebuild their fleet, the Athenians were forced to melt down golden religious statues from the acropolis, and the 110 ships the city possessed after this construction were crewed by a mix of less-experienced rowers, farmers, wealthy cavalrymen, and emancipated slaves. [...] All eight generals who remained at Athens, Thrasyllus among them, sailed <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> scratch fleet; none is known to have served as supreme commander. [...] The Athenian fleet, bolstered by 55 ships from allied cities, met a Spartan fleet of 120 ships under Callicratidas at the Arginusae islands, just south of Lesbos. [...] In the resulting battle, the Athenians divided their fleet into 8 autonomous divisions, with Thrasyllus commanding the forward right wing; by limiting the opportunities for the Spartan crews to exercise their superior seamanship, the Athenians were able to wear their enemies down, and the day ended in a decisive Athenian victory. [...] The remnants of the Peloponnesian fleet fled southward, leaving some 70 ships behind, and the blockading force at Mytilene, upon hearing of the result, also fled.|$|E
