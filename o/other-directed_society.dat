5000|$|Monster on the Campus has {{attracted}} {{a fair amount of}} academic interest. Prof. Cyndy Hendershot in 2001 wrote that the film examines [...] "issues of conformity and individuality" [...] through a [...] "metaphor of monstrous transformation." [...] Hendershot says that while Blake the professor represents conformity, Blake the caveman is a representation of individuality. But he can't be conformist and individualistic at the same time. His employer, Dunsfield University, [...] "conspires to stamp out individuality that does not follow the direction of the organization as a whole." [...] That is, [...] "while Monster on the Campus adopts the typical sf/horror plot of the mad scientist versus the blind authorities," [...] the movie [...] "frames the issue specifically within the world of the organization man." [...] According to Hendershot, a man such as Blake - driven from within toward individualism and not at all a good organization man who willingly submits to conformity imposed on him from the outside - can't win. His personal goal of knowledge for the sake of knowledge is not that of the university, which seems more interested in the publicity that owning a rare coelacanth will bring. [...] "But, if the film condemns the <b>other-directed</b> <b>society</b> as stifling scientific knowledge, it equally condemns Blake's rampant inner-directed man. It reveals, in fact, that the individual within is a beast." ...|$|E
