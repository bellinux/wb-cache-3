5|$|The floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> was {{originally}} made of hard-packed flint gravel {{held together with}} iron panning, excavated from a local gravel deposit, which {{was used as a}} more readily available alternative to stone. In subsequent years it was repaired with brick, tile and, ultimately, cement, obscuring the original appearance of the floor. An indication of how it would have looked can still be obtained from the outside of the west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the Cornerstone article, English Heritage stepped in to begin legal proceedings that would lead to the compulsory purchase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn.</b> It carried out emergency repairs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> in November 2009, without the owners' consent, under an Urgent Works Notice. The agency carried out an unusual legal manoeuvre to speed up the works, declassifying the barn from a scheduled monument to a Grade I listed building. This enabled the notice to be issued more speedily, overriding the owners' objections.|$|E
5|$|The boards on the {{exterior}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> are made from a mixture of oak, elm and softwoods such as pine and fir. Some are of modern or relatively modern origins; those on the south end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> are noticeably lighter in colour than the rest and {{are the result of}} the repairs made after the 1972 fire. Each side of the barn's roof holds 92 tile courses and a total of around 76,000 tiles, which were originally held in place by oak pegs. Many of the tiles have been replaced over the years and the oak pegs have been replaced by galvanised peg nails due to the effects of decay.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} to present structural status and development prospects of sheep barns and to identify investigate the existing problems. Eighteen sheep barns from seven villages of central town in Tekirdag were selected for this studyThe results indicated that 45. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barns</b> was „‟ open‟‟ type while 55. 5 % was “closed” type.

25|$|The Dennis Otte Round Barn is a round <b>barn</b> in <b>the</b> U.S. state <b>of</b> Illinois near <b>the</b> unincorporated Stephenson County {{community}} <b>of</b> Eleroy. <b>The</b> <b>barn</b> {{was built}} in 1930 by Herman Altenbern and has a diameter of 54 feet (16.5 m). <b>The</b> <b>barn</b> is representative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last round <b>barn</b> design variations that evolved. <b>The</b> Otte Round <b>Barn</b> {{was added to the}} U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1984.|$|R
5|$|The design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> has {{provided}} inspiration {{to a number}} of architects in the 19th and 20th centuries who were involved with the Gothic Revival movement. Sir George Gilbert Scott visited the barn in 1850 and sketched it, using its design as the basis for proposals for the new ChristChurch Cathedral in Christchurch, New Zealand. The library of Mansfield College, Oxford designed by Basil Champneys in the late 1880s also owes its inspiration to the barn. Bedales School's library, completed in 1922 and designed by Ernest Gimson, may also have had its origins in the barn's design.|$|E
5|$|Martin pairs often nest alone, {{although}} where suitable {{sites are}} available small loose colonies may form. These {{are more common}} south of the Sahara, where up to 40 rock martin pairs together have been recorded. Crag martins aggressively defend their nesting territory against conspecifics and other species. The nest, built by both adults over several weeks, is made from several hundred mud pellets and lined with soft dry grass or sometimes feathers. It may be a half-cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff, or shaped as a bowl like that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> swallow when placed on a sheltered ledge. The nest may be built on a rock cliff face, in a crevice or on a man-made structure, and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years. Usually two broods are raised, and the rock martin may nest {{for a third time}} in a season.|$|E
5|$|The diet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> owl {{has been}} much studied; the items {{consumed}} can be ascertained from identifying the prey fragments in the pellets of indigestible matter that the bird regurgitates. Studies of diet {{have been made in}} most parts of the bird's range, and in moist temperate areas over 90% of the prey tends to be small mammals, whereas in hot, dry, unproductive areas, the proportion is lower, and a great variety of other creatures are eaten depending on local abundance. Most prey is terrestrial but bats and birds are also taken, as well as lizards, amphibians and insects. Even when they are plentiful and other prey scarce, earthworms do not seem to be consumed.|$|E

5|$|The east bay <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> {{contains}} an animal stall in its northeast corner and a fully enclosed office in its opposite corner. The second-floor hayloft {{is supported by}} the two massive transverse beams. The full-sized loft is accessible via an enclosed staircase against the south wall. The building's exterior roof is fully supported by the brick walls. The result is a loft which is an entirely open space save for some pole and beam construction supporting the laminated beams, which act as tie rods {{at the base of the}} roof. The barn roof is a common gable roof pitched at a 45degree angle, it was originally covered with wooden shingles, those have been replaced over the years with asphalt.|$|E
5|$|The nest, {{built by}} both adults over several weeks, {{is made from}} several hundred mud pellets and lined with {{feathers}} and soft, dry grass, hair, sheep’s wool or plant down. It may be a half-cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff, or shaped as a bowl like that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> swallow when placed on a sheltered ledge. The nest may be built on a rock cliff face, in a crevice or on a man-made structure, and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years. Caves are found in limestone formations and in the lava flows which cover much of western Saudi Arabia, and their ceilings are a favoured location for nesting pale crag martins, red-rumped swallows, and the little swifts which may appropriate the hirundines' nests. In buildings, nests are usually constructed against concrete, which provides adhesion {{similar to that of}} rock, but metal walls are sometimes used, and nests may be supported on beams or other horizontal supports. Birds sometimes breed in occupied buildings, and there is a record of a pair nesting in a busy restaurant kitchen. Artificial nests are readily used, and halved coconut shells have been successfully occupied in Abu Dhabi.|$|E

25|$|The barn {{was given}} to the diocese by the Lambert family, with major {{contributions}} from their Hoare relations, one of whom– Walter Hoare of Basingstoke– supplied specially baked tiles and two-inch bricks of 17th-century style to match the timbers.

The slate slabs in the porches are the original threshing floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn.</b> The mullioned windows are copied from Compton Wynyates in Warwickshire. The tower-frame, copied from Tandridge Church near Oxted, was made from timber cut at South Park, Bletchingley. The bell was given by Holy Trinity, Wandsworth. The broach spire was copied from St Swithun's Church, Martyr Worthy near Winchester.|$|E
25|$|Dairy cattle housing systems {{vary greatly}} {{throughout}} the world depending on the climate, dairy size, and feeding strategies. Housing must provide access to feed, water and protection from relevant environmental conditions. One obvious issue for humanely housing cattle is temperature extremes. Heat stress can decrease fertility and milk production in cattle. Providing shade is a very common method for reducing heat stress. Barns may also incorporate fans or tunnel ventilation into the architecture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> structure. Overly cold conditions, while rarely deadly for cattle, cause increases in maintenance energy requirements and thus increased feed intake and decreased milk production. During the winter months, where temperatures are low enough, dairy cattle are often kept inside barns which are warmed by their collective body heat.|$|E

Back at the barn, a container from Rumplestiltskin's vault (which Hook accidentally disturbed in the vault) is revealed to have fallen through the portal.
