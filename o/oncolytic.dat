5|$|Efforts are {{underway}} {{to develop new}} drugs. Some of these involve targeted therapies against the cancer cells' molecular mechanisms. Others aim to target the highly resistant cancer stem cells. Still others aim to affect the non-neoplastic stroma and microenvironment of the tumor, which is known to influence cell proliferation and metastasis. A further approach {{involves the use of}} immunotherapy, such as <b>oncolytic</b> viruses.|$|E
5|$|Virotherapy {{involves}} the use of genetically modified viruses to treat diseases. Viruses have been modified by scientists to reproduce in cancer cells and destroy them but not infect healthy cells. Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), for example, is a modified herpes simplex virus that has had a gene, which is required for viruses to replicate in healthy cells, deleted and replaced with a human gene (GM-CSF) that stimulates immunity. When this virus infects cancer cells, it destroys them and in doing so the presence the GM-CSF gene attracts dendritic cells from the surrounding tissues of the body. The dendritic cells process the dead cancer cells and present components of them to other cells of the immune system. Having completed successful clinical trials, this virus is expected to gain approval for the treatment of a skin cancer called melanoma in late 2015. Viruses that have been reprogrammed to kill cancer cells are called <b>oncolytic</b> viruses.|$|E
25|$|In some {{countries}} <b>oncolytic</b> virotherapy methods are studied {{and used to}} treat melanoma. <b>Oncolytic</b> virotherapy is a promising branch of virotherapy, where <b>oncolytic</b> viruses are used to treat diseases; viruses can increase metabolism, reduce anti-tumor immunity and disorganize vasculature. Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) (which is a herpes simplex virus type 1–derived <b>oncolytic</b> immunotherapy), was shown to be useful against metastatic melanoma in 2015 with an increased survival of 4.4 months.|$|E

25|$|JX-594, an <b>oncolytic</b> virus, has {{orphan drug}} {{designation}} for this condition and is undergoing clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oncolytic</b> viruses are {{viruses that}} preferably infect cancer cells. While early efforts to employ these viruses in the therapy of cancer failed, {{there have been}} reports in 2005 and 2006 of {{encouraging}} preliminary results.|$|E
25|$|Dendritic {{cells can}} also be {{activated}} in vivo by making tumour cells express GM-CSF. This {{can be achieved by}} either genetically engineering tumor cells to produce GM-CSF or by infecting tumor cells with an <b>oncolytic</b> virus that expresses GM-CSF.|$|E
25|$|The {{drug was}} created and {{initially}} developed by BioVex, Inc. and was continued by Amgen, which acquired BioVex in 2011. It {{was the first}} <b>oncolytic</b> virus approved in the West; it was approved in the US in October 2015 and provisionally approved in Europe in December 2015.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>oncolytic</b> {{virus to}} be {{approved}} by a regulatory agency was a genetically modified adenovirus named H101 by Shanghai Sunway Biotech. It gained regulatory approval in 2005 from China's State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) for the treatment of head and neck cancer.|$|E
25|$|T-vec was {{approved}} by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat melanoma in October 2015. It was the first approval of an <b>oncolytic</b> virus in the West. It was provisionally approved by the European Medicines Agency in December of that year – continued marketing approval depended on further clinical results.|$|E
25|$|Orthoreovirus is a genus of viruses, in {{the family}} Reoviridae, in the {{subfamily}} Spinareovirinae. Vertebrates serve as natural hosts. There are currently five species in this genus including the type species mammalian orthoreovirus. Diseases associated with this genus include mild upper respiratory tract disease, gastroenteritis, and biliary atresia. Mammalian orthoreovirus type 3 (strain dearing-T3D) induces cell death preferentially in transformed cells and therefore displays inherent <b>oncolytic</b> properties.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{relevant}} uses for the mammalian orthoreoviruses are the manipulation of their <b>oncolytic</b> properties for their use in cancer treatments. This particular use of reoviruses was discovered in 1995 by Dr Patrick Lee who discovered these viruses could kill those cells that contained an over-activated Ras pathway, often a hallmark of cancerous cells. These viruses are particularly ideal for these sort of therapies because they are self-limiting while simultaneously harnessing the ability to induce apoptosis in tumor cells exclusively. One of the more widely used strains for these anti-cancer clinical trials is the serotype 3 dearing strain, Resolysin, used in phase I-III trials. A variety of cancers have been treated with this therapy, either alone or in tandem with others, including multiple myeloma, ovarian epithelial, and pancreatic cancers. A recent clinical trial demonstrated that mammalian orthoreovirus was effective in inducing apoptosis in hypoxic prostate tumor cells with hopes of success in clinical trials.|$|E

2500|$|Herpes simplex {{virus is}} {{considered}} as a potential therapy for cancer and has been extensively clinically tested to assess its <b>oncolytic</b> (cancer killing) ability. [...] Interim overall survival data from Amgen's phase 3 trial of a genetically-attenuated herpes virus suggests efficacy against melanoma.|$|E
2500|$|T-Vec is {{a genetically}} {{engineered}} herpes virus (an <b>oncolytic</b> herpes virus). [...] Two genes were removed – one that shuts down an individual cell's defenses, {{and another that}} helps the virus evade the immune system –, and a gene for human GM-CSF was added. [...] The drug works by replicating in cancer cells, causing them to burst; it was also designed to stimulate an immune response but as of 2016, {{there was no evidence}} of this.|$|E
2500|$|T-Vec is a {{biopharmaceutical}} drug; {{it is an}} <b>oncolytic</b> {{herpes virus}} that was created by genetically engineering a strain of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) taken from a person infected with the virus, rather than a laboratory strain. [...] Both copies of the viral gene coding for ICP34.5 were deleted and replaced with the gene coding for human GM-CSF, and the gene coding for ICP47 was removed. [...] In wild herpes virus, ICP47 suppresses the immune response to the virus; it was removed because the drug was designed {{with the intention of}} activating the immune system.|$|E
2500|$|Apoptosis in HeLa {{cells is}} {{inhibited}} by proteins {{produced by the}} cell; these inhibitory proteins target retinoblastoma tumor-suppressing proteins. These tumor-suppressing proteins regulate the cell cycle, but are rendered inactive when bound to an inhibitory protein. HPV E6 and E7 are inhibitory proteins expressed by the human papillomavirus, HPV being responsible {{for the formation of}} the cervical tumor from which HeLa cells are derived. HPV E6 causes p53, which regulates the cell cycle, to become inactive. HPV E7 binds to retinoblastoma tumor suppressing proteins and limits its ability to control cell division. [...] These two inhibitory proteins are partially responsible for HeLa cells' immortality by inhibiting apoptosis to occur. CDV (Canine Distemper Virus) is able to induce apoptosis despite the presence of these inhibitory proteins. This is an important <b>oncolytic</b> property of CDV: this virus is capable of killing canine lymphoma cells. Oncoproteins E6 and E7 still leave p53 inactive, but they are not able to avoid the activation of caspases induced from the stress of viral infection. These <b>oncolytic</b> properties provided a promising link between CDV and lymphoma apoptosis, which can lead to development of alternative treatment methods for both canine lymphoma and human non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Defects in the cell cycle are thought to be responsible for the resistance to chemotherapy or radiation by certain tumor cells, so a virus that can induce apoptosis despite defects in the cell cycle is useful for cancer treatment.|$|E

50|$|Akseli Hemminki’s {{research}} {{focuses on}} cancer immunotherapy and especially on <b>oncolytic</b> adenoviruses. The goal of his research group {{is to create a}} new <b>oncolytic</b> adenovirus based treatment for cancers with no available curative treatment at the moment. The key finding of the group is that <b>oncolytic</b> viruses - besides lyse tumor cells by oncolysis - trigger immune response towards the tumor. Recently, Hemminki’s group has focused on attempting to enable T-cell therapy of solid tumors with <b>oncolytic</b> adenoviruses.To facilitate setting up clinical trials Akseli Hemminki has founded two biotechnology companies: 2008 Oncos Therapeutics (merged with Targovax ASA in 2015) and 2013 TILT Biotherapeutics.

50|$|Traditional {{research}} has focussed on species C Adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) for creating <b>oncolytic</b> vaccines {{for the potential}} use as cancer treatment.

For example, <b>oncolytic</b> vaccines based on the Ad5 serotype have relatively poor clinical efficacy as monotherapies. The need for increased potency (infectivity and lytic activity) has led to an expanded search involving a larger number of less well studied adenovirus serotypes.|$|E
