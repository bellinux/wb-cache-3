5|$|This {{record is}} {{a version of}} our now deleted and illegal LP '1987, What The Fuck Is Going On?' {{with all of the}} {{copyright}} infringing 'samples' edited out. As this leaves less than 25 minutes of music we are able to sell it as a 12-inch 45. If you follow the instructions below you will, after some practice, be able to simulate the sound of <b>our</b> <b>original</b> record. To do this you will need 3 wired-up record decks, a pile of selected discs, one t.v. set and a video machine loaded with a cassette of edited highlights of last weeks 'Top of the Pops'. Deck one is to play this record on, the other two are to scratch in the missing parts using the selected records. For added authentic effect you could use a Roland 808 drum machine (well cheap and what we used in the original recordings) to play along behind your scratching.|$|E

500|$|The idea of reuniting with Nolan and Cooper {{was first}} {{proposed}} in January 2010, when Mark O'Connell suggested Lazzara talk with Nolan on the phone.

500|$|Early Christian theologian Origen also {{presented}} suffering as {{necessary for the}} development of human beings. Theologian Mark Scott has argued that John Hick's theodicy is more closely aligned with Origen's beliefs than Irenaeus' and ought to be called an [...] "Origenian theodicy". Origen used two metaphors for the world: it is a school and a hospital for souls, with God as Teacher and Physician, in which suffering plays both an educative and healing role. Through an allegorical reading of Exodus and the books of Solomon, Origen casts human development as a progression though a series of stages which take place in this life and after death. Origen believed that all humans will eventually reach heaven as the logical conclusion of God being 'all in all'. Hell is a metaphor for the purification of our souls: our sinful nature goes to 'Hell' and <b>our</b> <b>original</b> nature, created by God, goes to heaven. Scott argues that significant aspects of Origen's theology mean that there is a stronger continuation between it and Hick's theodicy. These aspects are Origen's allegorical treatment of Adam and Eve, the presentation of the world as a hospital or schoolroom, the progression he advocates of the human soul, and his universalism.|$|E

500|$|On September 15, 2017, Douglas Elmendorf, {{dean of the}} Kennedy School, {{announced}} that Chelsea Manning {{had been invited to}} spend only one day at the school, and that her title of visiting fellow did not convey a special honor. [...] "We did not intend to honor her in any way," [...] Elmendorf wrote, [...] "or to endorse any of her words or deeds‚Ä¶. However, I now think that designating Chelsea Manning as a Visiting Fellow was a mistake, for which I accept responsibility. ‚Ä¶ Therefore, we are withdrawing the invitation to her to serve as a Visiting Fellow‚Äîand the perceived honor that it implies to some people‚Äîwhile maintaining the invitation for her to spend a day at the Kennedy School and speak in the Forum. I apologize to her and to the many concerned people from whom I have heard today for not recognizing upfront the full implications of <b>our</b> <b>original</b> invitation." [...] When Elmendorf phoned Manning, a member of her support team challenged him to explain why Harvard was so concerned about the title [...] "visiting fellow." [...] The team was alienated by his response, which they inferred suggested she had nothing to contribute. Manning then hung up on the dean.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of a sequel to Sam & Max Hit the Road was announced by LucasArts on August 27, 2002. In their press release, LucasArts president Simon Jeffery stated that [...] "the Sam & Max sequel, much like the recently announced , perfectly complements LucasArts' renowned adventure game legacy and lends further support to the company's commitment to investing in and developing more of <b>our</b> <b>original</b> properties". LucasArts revealed no additional details at the time beyond a projected release {{in the first quarter}} of 2004. The game was officially announced for Windows at the Electronic Entertainment Expo convention on May 12, 2003, where the full title Sam & Max: Freelance Police was revealed. LucasArts reaffirmed the projected early 2004 release date at the convention. The game's trailer was also presented at E3, reintroducing the characters and confirming that the original voice actors for Sam and Max, Bill Farmer and Nick Jameson respectively, were set to reprise their roles. Over the following months, several minor media releases were made, revealing new information regarding the game's developmental direction and graphical style. The game's release was highly anticipated by journalists in the video game industry, who published various previews and interviews with the development team, particularly with lead designer Michael Stemmle, one of the original designers of Sam & Max Hit the Road.|$|E
500|$|In October 2001, {{the game}} was officially {{announced}} in a press release by Mad Doc. Steve Nadeau, the lead designer of the game at both development studios, said that {{he looked forward to}} polishing Jane's Attack Squadron and [...] "giv it a new life". He believed that the team was [...] "very excited" [...] to finish the game, a sentiment later echoed by the game's producer, David Halpern. According to Nadeau, the presence of members of the Looking Glass team ensured that it would [...] "closely reflect <b>our</b> <b>original</b> vision of the game: an action-packed World War II air combat simulation accessible to users of all skill levels". Farrar announced that the team's mission and physics editors would be released alongside the game, which he hoped would generate interest among players. Farrar later commented that, because of the game's physics-based damage system and individually modelled components, wings could be shot off and fuel tanks detonated. He also explained that coolant tanks could be hit, giving the pilot a limited amount of time before the plane engine overheated. He wrote that losing a wing tip meant [...] "a bumpy ride", but the loss of the tail caused the plane to [...] "spin into the ground". Jane's Attack Squadron went gold in March 2002, and was released that month.|$|E

500|$|Suppose {{we start}} with one {{electron}} at a certain place and time (this place and time being given the arbitrary label A) and a photon at another place and time (given the label B). A typical question from a physical standpoint is: 'What is the probability of finding an electron at C (another place and a later time) and a photon at D (yet another place and time)?'. The simplest process to achieve this end is for the electron to move from A to C (an elementary action) and for the photon to move from B to D (another elementary action). From {{a knowledge of the}} probability amplitudes of each of these sub-processes ‚Äì E(A to C) and P(B to D) ‚Äì then we would expect to calculate the probability amplitude of both happening together by multiplying them, using rule b) above. This gives a simple estimated overall probability amplitude, which is squared to give an estimated probability. [...] But there are other ways in which the end result could come about. The electron might move to a place and time E where it absorbs the photon; then move on before emitting another photon at F; then move on to C where it is detected, [...] while the new photon moves on to D. The probability of this complex process can again be calculated by knowing the probability amplitudes of each of the individual actions: three electron actions, two photon actions and two vertexes ‚Äì one emission and one absorption. We would expect to find the total probability amplitude by multiplying the probability amplitudes of each of the actions, for any chosen positions of E and F. We then, using rule a) above, have to add up all these probability amplitudes for all the alternatives for E and F. (This is not elementary in practice, and involves integration.) But there is another possibility, which is that the electron first moves to G where it emits a photon which goes on to D, while the electron moves on to H, where it absorbs the first photon, before moving on to C. Again we can calculate the probability amplitude of these possibilities (for all points G and H). We then have a better estimation for the total probability amplitude by adding the probability amplitudes of these two possibilities to <b>our</b> <b>original</b> simple estimate. Incidentally the name given to this process of a photon interacting with an electron in this way is Compton scattering.|$|E
