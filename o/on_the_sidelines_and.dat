500|$|The 1934 NFL Championship Game, {{dubbed the}} [...] "Sneakers Game" [...] because the Giants donned sneakers at halftime {{to get better}} traction, {{resulted}} in a 30–13 win on {{the field for the}} team but an even more important victory in the box office. Tickets for the game sold so fast that Mara decided to add 6,000 temporary seats <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> <b>and</b> in other portions of the stadium, which resulted in the team taking in $64,504 from that game alone.|$|E

500|$|Franken said {{he learned}} that 21% of Americans {{received}} most of their news from talk radio, an almost exclusively conservative medium. Said Franken, [...] "I didn't want to sit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines,</b> <b>and</b> I believed Air America could make a difference." [...] In November 2003, Franken talked about moving {{back to his home}} state of Minnesota to run for the Senate. At the time the seat, once held by Wellstone, was occupied by Republican Norm Coleman. At a 2004 Democratic presidential campaign event, Franken tackled a man who was allegedly threatening other attendees and heckling Governor Howard Dean. [...] In 2005, Franken announced his move to Minnesota: [...] "I can tell you honestly, I don't know if I'm going to run, but I'm doing the stuff I need {{to do in order to}} do it." [...] In late 2005, Franken started his own political action committee, called Midwest Values PAC. By early 2007, the PAC raised more than $1 million.|$|E

500|$|Dougan {{was signed}} by Aston Villa in July 1961 for a fee of £15,000. He {{was signed by}} manager Joe Mercer as a {{replacement}} for Gerry Hitchens, who had been sold on to Inter Milan earlier in the summer for £85,000. Teammate Peter McParland later commented that [...] "when Derek came to us at Aston Villa I think it was {{at a time when he}} was not taking the game particularly seriously". After returning from watching his [...] "Villans" [...] teammates win the 1961 League Cup Final at Villa Park on 5 September, Dougan was a passenger in a car accident which killed fellow passenger Malcolm Williams and left Dougan with a broken arm and head injuries; driver and teammate Bobby Thomson was charged but found 'Not Guilty' of careless driving. In November 2010 – three years after Dougan's death, Thomson claimed that Dougan had drunkenly pulled a deerstalker hat over his eyes, causing him to crash the car. Dougan recovered after three months <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> <b>and</b> ended the 1961–62 season with 12 goals in 27 matches. He twisted his knee midway through the 1962–63 campaign after slipping in the street, and ended the season with 14 goals from 33 games.|$|E

500|$|Arthur and his retinue {{appear in}} some of the Lais of Marie de France, but it was the work of another French poet, Chrétien de Troyes, that had the {{greatest}} influence with regard to the development of Arthur's character and legend. Chrétien wrote five Arthurian romances between [...] and 1190. Erec and Enide and Cligès are tales of courtly love with Arthur's court as their backdrop, demonstrating the shift away from the heroic world of the Welsh and Galfridian Arthur, while Yvain, the Knight of the Lion, features Yvain and Gawain in a supernatural adventure, with Arthur very much <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> <b>and</b> weakened. However, the most significant {{for the development of the}} Arthurian legend are Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart, which introduces Lancelot and his adulterous relationship with Arthur's queen (Guinevere), extending and popularising the recurring theme of Arthur as a cuckold, and Perceval, the Story of the Grail, which introduces the Holy Grail and the Fisher King and which again sees Arthur having a much reduced role. Chrétien was thus [...] "instrumental both in the elaboration of the Arthurian legend and in the establishment of the ideal form for the diffusion of that legend", and much of what came after him in terms of the portrayal of Arthur and his world built upon the foundations he had laid. Perceval, although unfinished, was particularly popular: four separate continuations of the poem appeared over the next half century, with the notion of the Grail and its quest being developed by other writers such as Robert de Boron, a fact that helped accelerate the decline of Arthur in continental romance. Similarly, Lancelot and his cuckolding of Arthur with Guinevere became one of the classic motifs of the Arthurian legend, although the Lancelot of the prose Lancelot (...) and later texts was a combination of Chrétien's character and that of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven's Lanzelet. Chrétien's work even appears to feed back into Welsh Arthurian literature, with the result that the romance Arthur began to replace the heroic, active Arthur in Welsh literary tradition. Particularly significant in this development were the three Welsh Arthurian romances, which are closely similar to those of Chrétien, albeit with some significant differences: Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain is related to Chrétien's Yvain; Geraint and Enid, to Erec and Enide; and Peredur son of Efrawg, to Perceval.|$|E

The new commander Louis Marie Turreau finally arrived on 11 October and was aghast at the way the representatives ordered around the generals. The representatives did not like Turreau and asked to the Minister of War to recall him. Because of a missed communication between the War Office and army headquarters, Turreau decided to allow Aoust to continue in acting command while he sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> <b>and</b> wrote complaining letters to his political friends.

2500|$|Beginning {{with the}} 1994 season, the Houston Cougars {{football}} team began splitting their home schedule with the Astrodome and Robertson Stadium. [...] The University of Houston ended its lease agreement to hold home football {{games at the}} Astrodome before the 1998 season, moving the entire home slate of games back to Robertson Stadium on campus {{for the first time}} since 1949. In 1996, adjacent Jeppesen Gymnasium, in need of heavy renovations, was demolished to make way for a new scoreboard. [...] The stadium was heavily renovated in 1999 to bring it up to NCAA Division I-A (now Division I FBS) standards for football venues. The playing surface was lowered nine feet and the running track eliminated to facilitate the addition of new seating <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> <b>and</b> end zones. A total of twenty luxury suites were also constructed above both sides of the stadium. The playing field itself was named in honor of Houston attorney John O'Quinn, a donor to the project, thus modifying its official name to [...] "John O'Quinn Field at Robertson Stadium".
