These technologies include magnetic alignment of nanotubes, fabrication of nanotube membranes or buckypapers, production of nanotube composites, modeling of nanotube-epoxy interaction at the molecular level, and characterization of SWNT nanocomposites for mechanical properties, electrical conductivity, thermal management, radiation shielding and EMI attenuation. HPMI personnel also established Florida's first National Science Foundation (NSF) Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC).|$|E
5|$|The 3D version opened Friday, August 25, 2017, across 371 theaters (or 463 3D auditoriums), earning $552,773 in {{its opening}} weekend, {{averaging}} $1,490 per screen; this {{was considered an}} amount lower than what other '80's and '90's re-releases earned in their respective opening weekends such as Top Gun ($1.9 million, which also played in IMAX), Raiders of the Lost Ark ($1.6 million), {{as well as more}} high-profile reissues of Titanic, The Lion King and Jurassic Park <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>years.</b> During its opening weekend, Titanic 3D grossed $17.3 million in 2,674 theaters, averaging $6,464 in April 2012. While not major contributing factors, the release performance of the film is thought to have suffered from coinciding with Hurricane Harvey, which eased moviegoing admissions {{in many parts of the}} country, the much anticipated boxing fight between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Conor McGregor, the season 7 finale of Game of Thrones, and by Cameron's decision to release his original 1991 theatrical cut instead of the widely popular extended edition, and his controversial comments regarding the Wonder Woman film.|$|E

25|$|<b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>years,</b> {{there has}} been a {{resurgence}} in interest in performing precise Michelson–Morley type experiments using lasers, masers, cryogenic optical resonators, etc. This is in large part due to predictions of quantum gravity that suggest that special relativity may be violated at scales accessible to experimental study. The first of these highly accurate experiments was conducted by Brillet & Hall (1979), in which they analyzed a laser frequency stabilized to a resonance of a rotating optical Fabry–Pérot cavity. They set a limit on the anisotropy of the speed of light resulting from the Earth's motions of Δc/c≈10−15, where Δc is the difference between the speed of light in the x- and y-directions.|$|E
25|$|The {{season is}} usually a few races shorter {{than that of the}} Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, and the prize money is {{significantly}} lower. However, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>years,</b> a number of Cup Series drivers have run both the Xfinity and Cup Series events each weekend, using the Xfinity race as a warm-up to the Cup event at the same facility. Furthermore, several drivers not only participated in both Cup and Busch/Nationwide events in the same weekend but also began to compete in both series on a full-time basis. Kevin Harvick was the first Cup series driver to compete full-time in the Busch Series and win a title, actually doing so twice; in 2001, he did this for Richard Childress Racing but only did so out of necessity as Dale Earnhardt's death forced him into the Cup series ahead of RCR's intended schedule for him. His win in 2006, where he raced three separate cars for RCR and his own race team, was the first of five consecutive titles in NBS/NNS that were won by Cup series regulars.|$|E
