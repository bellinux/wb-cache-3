40|$|Objective While many jurisdictions internationally now require learner {{drivers to}} {{complete}} a specified number of hours of supervised driving practice before being able to drive unaccompanied, very few require learner drivers {{to complete a}} <b>log</b> <b>book</b> to record this practice and then present it to the licensing authority. Learner drivers in most Australian jurisdictions must complete a <b>log</b> <b>book</b> that records their practice thereby confirming to the licensing authority that they have met the mandated hours of practice requirement. These <b>log</b> <b>books</b> facilitate the management and enforcement of minimum supervised hours of driving requirements. Method Parents of learner drivers in two Australian states, Queensland and New South Wales, completed an online survey assessing a range of factors, including {{their perceptions of the}} accuracy of their child’s learner <b>log</b> <b>book</b> and the effectiveness of the <b>log</b> <b>book</b> system. Results The study indicates that the large majority of parents believe that their child’s learner <b>log</b> <b>book</b> is accurate. However, they generally report that the <b>log</b> <b>book</b> system is only moderately effective as a system to measure the number of hours of supervised practice a learner driver has completed. Conclusions The {{results of this study suggest}} the presence of a paradox with many parents possibly believing that others are not as diligent in the use of <b>log</b> <b>books</b> as they are or that the system is too open to misuse. Given that many parents report that their child’s <b>log</b> <b>book</b> is accurate, this study has important implications for the development and ongoing monitoring of hours of practice requirements in graduated driver licensing systems...|$|R
5|$|Electronic Logging Devices can {{be thought}} of as an {{automated}} electronic <b>log</b> <b>book.</b> An ELD records the same information as a manual paper <b>log</b> <b>book,</b> and requires less input from the driver. The ELD automatically records driving time and location, leaving the driver responsible only for reporting on-duty and off-duty time. In these respects, the ELD is less susceptible to forgery than a paper <b>log</b> <b>book.</b>|$|R
5|$|Keeping {{track of}} a driver's HOS {{requires}} {{the use of}} a <b>log</b> <b>book.</b> A truck driver's <b>log</b> <b>book</b> is a legally defined form containing a grid outlining the 24-hour day into 15-minute increments. The driver must specify where and when he/she stopped between driving shifts, what duties were performed (if any), along with the driver's name, truck number, company info, and other information. The driver must also present his or her <b>log</b> <b>book</b> to authorities upon request, for inspection. In lieu of a <b>log</b> <b>book,</b> a motor carrier may substitute an electronic on-board recorder to record the driver's hours.|$|R
5|$|Drivers can {{get away}} with this rule-breaking due to their paper-based <b>log</b> <b>books.</b> As a driver records their time spent behind the wheel, there is very little to stop them from forging their <b>log</b> <b>books.</b> There is very {{superficial}} oversight and some drivers take advantage of this fact. Surveys indicate that between 25% and 75% of drivers violate the HOS. Other drivers maintain more than one <b>log</b> <b>book,</b> showing falsified versions to enforcement officers.|$|R

40|$|Better {{information}} {{leads to}} better buildings! UK Building Regulations now require building <b>log</b> <b>books</b> {{in new and}} refurbished buildings. This paper describes the role of building <b>log</b> <b>books</b> in improving buildings by bringing together the design and facilities management communities. It outlines what a <b>log</b> <b>book</b> should include, as indicated by CIBSE TM 31, and how they {{might be used to}} log building energy performance, as shown in Good Practice Guide 348. The role of the designer, facilities manager and client are considered along with the benefits they may realise. Ten golden rules for building <b>log</b> <b>books</b> are provided to aid the development and use of <b>log</b> <b>books.</b> The great divide Why has such a great chasm opened up between building designers and operators? When we hewed out caves we were both designers and operators of the space and its services (fire and light). This combined approach lasted until about the 18 th century. Granted, buildings have become more complex but that isn't a reason to separate the professions to the present extent. Designers and operators should at least work together even if they are not one and the same person. Designers don't seem to talk to operators and few operators get to even meet the designers.
