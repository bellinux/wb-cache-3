This also led to complaints as more states joined the Confederacy, however, because there were more states than cabinet positions.|$|E

25|$|Living {{and working}} {{conditions}} in the camps varied significantly across time and place, depending, among <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> <b>on</b> the impact of broader events (World War II, countrywide famines and shortages, waves of terror, sudden influx or release {{of large numbers of}} prisoners). However, to one degree or another, the large majority of prisoners at most times faced meager food rations, inadequate clothing, overcrowding, poorly insulated housing, poor hygiene, and inadequate health care. Most prisoners were compelled to perform harsh physical labor. In most periods and economic branches, the degree of mechanization of work processes was significantly lower than in the civilian industry: tools were often primitive and machinery, if existent, short in supply. Officially established work hours were in most periods longer and days off were fewer than for civilian workers. Often official work time regulations were extended by local camp administrators.|$|E

So in June 1411 he made a truce with the Frisians, which was renewed in the following month. When he began organising a campaign for the middle of August, the Frisians became somewhat more accommodating, and a three-year truce could be negotiated, and the campaign was called off. Under the terms of this truce Hollandic merchants got access to coastal towns and villages in Oostergo and Westergo from Dokkum in the northeast all the way around to Lemmer in the southeast; the Vetkoper refugees were allowed to return home; and William VI was awarded a large sum of money.|$|E

25|$|There is {{biological}} {{variation in}} the human species—with traits such as blood type, cranial features, eye color, hair color and type, height and build, and skin color varying across the globe. Human body types vary substantially. The typical height of an adult human is between , although this varies significantly depending, among <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> <b>on</b> sex and ethnic origin. Body size is partly determined by genes and is also significantly influenced by environmental factors such as diet, exercise, and sleep patterns, especially as an influence in childhood. Adult height for each sex in a particular ethnic group approximately follows a normal distribution. Those aspects of genetic variation that give clues to human evolutionary history, or are relevant to medical research, have received particular attention. For example, the genes that allow adult humans to digest lactose are present in high frequencies in populations that have long histories of cattle domestication, suggesting natural selection having favored that gene in populations that depend on cow milk. Some hereditary diseases such as sickle cell anemia are frequent in populations where malaria has been endemic throughout history—it is believed that the same gene gives increased resistance to malaria {{among those who are}} unaffected carriers of the gene. Similarly, populations that have for a long time inhabited specific climates, such as arctic or tropical regions or high altitudes, tend to have developed specific phenotypes that are beneficial for conserving energy in those environments—short stature and stocky build in cold regions, tall and lanky in hot regions, and with high lung capacities at high altitudes. Similarly, skin color varies clinally with darker skin around the equator—where the added protection from the sun's ultraviolet radiation is thought to give an evolutionary advantage—and lighter skin tones closer to the poles.|$|E

500|$|In the World Championship, O'Sullivan {{defeated}} Craig Steadman 10–3 in {{the first}} round and Matthew Stevens 13–5 in the second round, but suffered a surprise 9–13 defeat to Stuart Bingham in the quarter-finals. O'Sullivan was involved in many incidents during the tournament. While playing Steadman, he breached snooker's dress code when he removed a pair of uncomfortable shoes and played briefly in his socks, before borrowing shoes from tournament director Mike Ganley. In his match with Stevens, frustrated at missing a shot, he almost snapped his cue in half by hitting it against the table. In his quarter-final match, O'Sullivan placed his chalk on the table and used it to line up a shot. Controversially, referee Terry Camilleri did not penalize him for the incident, even though many commentators, including former world champion Ken Doherty and former tour referee Michaela Tabb, argued that under the rules of snooker the referee should have called a 7-point foul. These incidents led Stephen Hendry to say that O'Sullivan was not fully focused. [...] "Personally I think it is a sign he has got <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>on</b> his mind," [...] said Hendry. [...] "He is not focused properly on winning the World Championship." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the sod blocks were cut, {{the grass}} was mown short or burned off. [...] At times, the surface was scored with a cutter or disc; the blocks could then be removed with a spade. [...] This approach, however, tended to produce rough and {{non-uniform}} blocks, which complicated the task of laying them in even courses. [...] Blocks could also be cut with a plow. [...] An ordinary plow could be used, given considerable skill and care {{on the part of}} the operator; however, the mouldboard tended to turn over and break up the blocks; even if intact blocks were produced, they were generally not of uniform thickness. [...] In the late 19th century, a modified plow designed specifically for sod cutting was invented: this [...] "grasshopper plow" [...] replaced the mouldboard with a set of adjustable rods, which allowed the operator to cut a uniform strip of sod three to six inches (...) deep and [...] wide. [...] This strip could then be cut into blocks. [...] The dimensions of these depended, among <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> <b>on</b> the strength of the builderthe blocks were dense, and had to be sized so that the builders could lift them.

Darren becomes friends with Mark {{in an attempt to}} deter Mark's bullying but Mark soon after rapes Luke. Darren takes advantage of the situation and begins a relationship with Luke's girlfriend Mandy Richardson (Sarah Jayne Dunn).

And all along, Luke knew that Darren wanted to get together with Mandy ... Luke has <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>on</b> his mind and seems to be ignoring Mandy, so Darren thinks it is the perfect opportunity to make his move". Before Darren asks Mandy out he confronts Luke who [...] "gives him the green light". Dawson opined that although viewers may think Mandy and Darren are being [...] "heartless" [...] they don't know about Luke's attack so are not to blame. Dawson felt that initially the relationship is a [...] "flirty kind of friendship" [...] although Mandy realises she likes Darren and plans to use Darren as a means of reuniting with Luke. As Darren and Mandy spend more time together their relationship [...] "develops". If Darren were to find out about Luke's rape, Dawson felt Darren would help Luke get [...] "revenge" [...] on Mark. He said Mandy would either be [...] "shocked and turn to Darren for support" [...] or [...] "feel guilty about what she's done" [...] and reunite with Luke. Dawson felt if this were to happen Darren would [...] "try to shrug it off" [...] although [...] "deep down, he cares for Mandy". Dawson felt that Darren should become a [...] "hero" [...] to Luke, fixing all his problems which would rectify him beginning a relationship with Mandy.|$|E
