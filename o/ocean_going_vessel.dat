40|$|Centrality in the world-system allows {{countries}} to externalize their hazards or environmental harms on others. Core countries, for instance, dump heavy metals {{and greenhouse gases}} into the global sinks, {{and some of the}} core's hazardous products, production processes and wastes are displaced to the (semi) peripheral zones of the world-system.

40|$|Chemical {{processing}} includes in wide {{terms the}} application of chemical reactions, mass and heat transfer. Traditional obstacle to utilisation of geothermal steam for chemical processes has been the limited steam temperatures and pressures available from the geothermal fluid separators. In a prefeasibility study of a plant for manufacturing of various glycols from sugars the viability in using geothermal steam for all main heating and separation tasks has been estimated. A model calculation based on chemical functional group contribution methods shows better separation behaviour at lower pressure and temperatures. This {{enables the use of}} medium pressure steam (10 - 15 bar) for 95 % of all thermal tasks. Only a minor part of the process tasks requires higher temperature where the heating media has to be 250 – 300 °C. This temperature can be obtained from a conventional high-pressure boiler system. Process optimisation and systematic re-utilisation of heat has reduced the steam consumption and enhanced the overall economy. Approximately 50 MWth of geothermal steam is needed to produce 120. 000 tpa glycols and alcohols and the low steam pressure required gives more options in locating the glycol plant.

40|$|The {{predictions}} {{for the future}} foretell an increase {{of the amount of}} exported grain over the Rio Paraná/Rio de la Plata system of 63 % in 2030. Besides this, the new Panama locks will be finished in 2015. Seeing as the current shipping standard is largely determined by the Panama locks, the general expectation is that the vessel dimensions will increase to a standard size that complies with the new locks. It is evident that the increase in maximum draft of these vessels makes the depth restrictions in the Rio de la Plata cut into their efficiency even harder. It is a reasonable assumption that {{something has to be done}} in order to keep the Rio Paraná system from collapsing. There are numerous types of solutions that could be applied for this problem. The chosen solution in this case is the construction of a new port somewhere in the Rio de la Plata. This port would serve as a transhipment station where inland vessels deliver the cargo from ports along Rio Paraná and where it gets transhipped into <b>ocean</b> <b>going</b> <b>vessels</b> with a New Panamax size, which have a maximum draft of 54 feet, for shipment across the ocean. This solution means that the <b>ocean</b> <b>going</b> <b>vessels</b> can fully utilise their maximum draft for the entire duration of their trip. Furthermore it means that, as far as the grain industry is concerned, the requirement for maintaining an artificial depth of 34 feet in the Rio de la Plata past the port is no longer required. The final design of the previously described port consists of an artificial island on Banco Chico off the coast of Magdalena in the Rio de la Plata. This location has been chosen due to political, environmental and cost related motivations and is located right next to the already existing shipping channel, making the required access channel for the port’s ocean basin shorter. The port is designed to be capable of receiving anything up to fully loaded New Panamax sized vessels and partially loaded Capesize vessels. On the river side of the port the system is designed to make use of tug/barge combinations with a loading capacity of 5600 tons and a draft of 14 feet. This draft means they can freely sail on most of the Rio de la Plata and do not necessarily require the maintained channels. The island itself gives room for (temporary) storage of commodities in between unloading and loading to ensure a constant supply of grain to load the ocean vessels and thus reduces the service time. All in all the construction of a transhipment port on an artificial island in the Rio de la Plata is a preliminarily feasible solution to the described problem. This does, however, mean that all the assumptions that have been made in the design phase will either have to be true, or false in a non-critical fashion. On top of that there are still numerous risks that could harm the operational feasibility of the port and make sure it will never exist. As long as sufficient research is done into the more critical aspects of these risks and assumptions, a lot of economic benefit could be gained from embarking on a new system.

40|$|The exhaust {{emissions}} from large marine diesel engines on <b>ocean</b> <b>going</b> <b>vessels</b> contains among other pollutants {{a significant amount}} of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) wich are the main by product of combustion and they contribute to acid rain as well as the formation of harmful ground-level ozone and photochemical smog. The manufacturers of the marine vessel engines and the shipbuilders have responded to the demands to reduce vessel emissions by improving the operation of the engines and by incorporating emissions control technologies in the design of new vessels. NOx formation is suppressed by water present in the combustion chamber. Water can be introduced in various ways, for example by humidification of the combustion air or by injecting water or steam directly into the combustion chamber, or as water-in-fuel emulsion. If water is evaporated inside the combustion chamber the adiabatic combustion temperature (heat load) is reduced {{as a result of the}} higher molar heat capacity of water compared to air. The lower temperature and the better fuel distribution are leading to a lower formation of NOx.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} evaluates {{emissions from}} several potentially significant emission sources including marine vessels, harbor craft, heavy duty vehicles, commercial cooking {{and natural gas}} fired turbines. PM and air toxics released to the atmosphere negatively impact air quality and human health. This dissertation characterizes the effects of newer technology fuels, aftertreatment and engine technology on <b>ocean</b> <b>going</b> <b>vessels</b> (OGVs) and harbor craft. In-use gaseous and particulate matter emissions were measured in real-time at sea aboard a {{very large crude carrier}} (VLCC) to evaluate a low sulfur heavy fuel oil (HFO) (110 ppm) as a potential replacement for marine gas oil (MGO). Results show that both NOx and PM 2. 5 emissions were still ~ 4 % and ~ 69 % lower with MGO compared to low sulfur HFO. Further, the impact of a hydrotreated algae fuel was characterized from a marine diesel generator aboard a Stalwart class marine vessel. NOx emissions showed slight benefits while PM 2. 5 emissions were similar when switching from the ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel (ULSD) to the hydrotreated algae diesel fuel blend (33 % by volume). Finally, a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and diesel particulate filter (DPF) aftertreatment controls installed aboard a tugboat led to significant reductions of NOx (~ 92 %) and PM 2. 5 (~ 96 %) emissions. This dissertation further characterizes the effectiveness of commercial cooking technologies on the physical and chemical nature of particle mass, particle number and gaseous toxics from commercial cooking operations.

40|$|A {{significant}} number of damage events continue to occur to <b>ocean</b> <b>going</b> <b>vessels,</b> many of which remain afloat in need of assistance to evaluate remedial actions to minimise the risk of further damage and conditions for onward transit for a repair facility. Therefore, {{it is vital that}} the post damage situation is rapidly understood to reduce damage propagation occurring, reducing the cost of repair and allowing more vessels to be recovered safely, ensuring the safety of personnel onboard. After an incident, {{it is often difficult to}} determine and model the precise damage scenario due to the inability to survey the area. Each scenario will have variability in geometrical and material properties, which will affect the residual strength of the structure. Variations in these aspects are not accounted for in methods currently utilised in damage response scenarios. Therefore, to be able to more accurately analyse the damage and provide better guidance to the crew in real time, it is important that this variability can be analysed, allowing an understanding of worst and best case scenarios, the probabilities of these occurring and their affect on the structural strength. Finite element analysis has been used to model damage scenarios due to the high level of accuracy that can be achieved. This paper demonstrates the implications of damage aperture on the limit state of stiffened steel panels, investigating the residual strength of the damaged structures and their sensitivity to variations in damage event, geometric and material properties. The results are then compared with the Smith and Dow progressive collapse method, [1, 2], with conclusions being drawn about the use of this method in damage situations. Further to this, the effects of variability in the ship are investigated for damage scenarios, showing that these influence the ultimate strength of the structure to a larger extent in the failure of damaged plates than intact scenarios; however, lack of knowledge relating to the area of the damage could overshadow other potential variability within these scenarios...|$|R
40|$|As {{a growing}} market for {{offshore}} wind power has created a niche for deep-water installations, offshore floating wind solutions have {{become more and more}} viable as a renewable energy source. This technology is currently in development and as with many new technologies, many traditional design methods are found lacking. In the multi-turbine platform design investigated, turbine units are placed closely together to conserve material use and reduce cost, however with such tightly spaced turbines; wake interaction poses a threat to the productivity and the lifespan of the installation. In order to fully capitalize on the substantial increase in available wind energy far at sea, it is important that these floating parks operate in an optimal way. The platform investigated in this report sports 3, 6 MW turbines which must be positioned such that wake interference is minimized; the platform must always bear a windward heading.   Maneuvering <b>ocean</b> <b>going</b> <b>vessels</b> has been practiced using automated dynamic positioning systems in the gas and oil industry for over 50 years, often employing submerged thrusters as a source of propulsion. These systems are mostly diesel powered and require extra operational maintenance, which would otherwise increase the cost and complexity of a floating wind farm. In this paper, it is suggested that the wind turbines themselves may be used to provide the thrust needed to correct the platform heading, thus eliminating the practical need for submerged thrusters. By controlling the blade pitch of the wind turbines, a turning moment (torque) can be exerted on the platform to correct heading (yaw) relative wind direction. Using the Hexicon H 3 - 18 MW platform as a starting point; hydrodynamic, aerodynamic and electromechanical properties of the system are explored, modeled and attempts at model predictive control are made.

40|$|Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are {{becoming}} increasingly important for military surveillance and mine detection. Most AUVs are battery powered and have limited lifetimes of {{a few days to}} a few weeks. This greatly limits the distance that AUVs can travel underwater. Using a series of submerged AUV charging stations, AUVs could travel a limited distance to the next charging station, recharge its batteries, and continue to the next charging station, thus traveling great distances in a relatively short time, similar to the Old West Pony Express. One solution is to use temperature differences at various depths in the ocean to produce electricity, which is then stored in a submerged battery. It is preferred to have the upper buoy submerged a reasonable distance below the surface, {{so as not to be}} seen from above and not to be inadvertently destroyed by storms or <b>ocean</b> <b>going</b> <b>vessels.</b> In a previous invention, a phase change material (PCM) is melted (expanded) at warm temperatures, for example, 15 C, and frozen (contracted) at cooler temperatures, for example, 8 C. Tubes containing the PCM, which could be paraffin such as pentadecane, would be inserted into a container filled with hydraulic oil. When the PCM is melted (expanded), it pushes the oil out into a container that is pressurized to about 3, 000 psi (approx equals 20. 7 MPa). When a valve is opened, the high-pressure oil passes through a hydraulic motor, which turns a generator and charges a battery. The low-pressure oil is finally reabsorbed into the PCM canister when the PCM tubes are frozen (contracted). Some of the electricity produced could be used to control an external bladder or a motor to the tether line, such that depth cycling is continued for a very long period of time. Alternatively, after the electricity is generated by the hydraulic motor, the exiting low-pressure oil from the hydraulic motor could be vented directly to an external bladder on the AUV, such that filling of the bladder causes the AUV to rise, and emptying of the bladder allows the AUV to descend. This type of direct buoyancy control is much more energy efficient than using electrical pumps in that the inefficiencies of converting thermal energy to electrical energy to mechanical energy is avoided. AUV charging stations have been developed that use electricity produced by waves on floating buoys and that use electricity from solar photovoltaics on floating buoys. This is the first device that has absolutely no floating or visible parts, and is thus impervious to storms, inadvertent ocean vessel collisions, or enemy sabotage...|$|R
40|$|Emissions from marine {{vessels are}} being {{scrutinized}} {{as a major}} contributor to the total particulate matter (TPM), oxides of sulfur (SOx) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) environmental loading. Fuel sulfur control is the key to SOx reduction. Significant reductions in the emissions from on-road vehicles have been achieved in the last decade and the emissions from these vehicles will be reduced by another order of magnitude in the next five years: these improvements have served to emphasize the need to reduce emissions from other mobile sources, including off road equipment, locomotives, and marine vessels. Diesel-powered vessels of interest include <b>ocean</b> <b>going</b> <b>vessels</b> with low- and medium-speed engines, as well as ferries with high speed engines, as discussed below. A recent study examined the use of intake water injection (WIS) and ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) to reduce the emissions from a high-speed passenger ferry in southern California. One of the four Detroit Diesel 12 V 92 two-stroke high speed engines that power the Waverider (operated by SCX, inc.) was instrumented to collect intake airflow, fuel flow, shaft torque, and shaft speed. Engine speed and shaft torque were uniquely linked for given vessel draft and prevailing wind and sea conditions. A raw exhaust gas sampling system was utilized to measure the concentration of NOx, carbon dioxide (CO 2), and oxygen (O 2) and a mini dilution tunnel sampling a slipstream from the raw exhaust was used to collect TPM on 70 mm filters. The emissions data were processed to yield brake-specific mass results. The system that was employed allowed for redundant data to be collected for quality assurance and quality control. To acquire the data, the Waverider was operated at five different steady state speeds. Three modes were in the open sea off Oceanside, CA, and idle and harbor modes were also used. Data have showed that the use of ULSD along with water injection (WIS) could significantly reduce the emissions of NOx and PM while not affecting fuel consumption or engine performance compared to the baseline marine diesel. The results showed that a nominal 40 % reduction in TPM was realized when switching from the marine diesel to the ULSD. A small reduction in NOx was also shown between the marine fuel and the ULSD. The implementation of the WIS showed that NOx was reduced significantly by between 11 % and 17 %, depending upon the operating condition. With the WIS, the TPM was reduced by a few percentage points, which was close to the confidence in measurement...|$|R
40|$|Fish is {{economically}} exciting. It {{is maybe}} {{as close to}} a free lunch as one can get: a gift by nature replenishing itself. But times when the oceans were a horn of plenty are over for good. A combination of fishing technology advances and behaviour has brought many of the world’s stocks to their limits and beyond. Similarly to other resources like fresh water or the climate, mankind must control its activity to prevent irreversible damages. Such management needs information: on the behaviour of fish and fishermen. Focussing on Norway's most valuable fish stock, this study investigates the economic-technological structure the two largest fleet segments of Norway’s coastal cod fishery. The coastal fleet is a peculiar industry: some of the numerous vessels are more than seventy years of age while others are brand-new. They (fish) are fishing with traditional methods but modern gear. Their range of operation is small and particular species are only fished seasonally. Coastal vessels thus 'appear' to not fit into the modern fish industry which demands a steady flow of fish to optimally utilise the processing facilities (Stendal and Aarset, 2001, p. 4). Seemingly a relic from other times, it is claimed by some to be a waste of resources: firstly because it consists of too many vessels and secondly because large <b>ocean</b> <b>going</b> <b>vessels</b> supposedly can do the job cheaper. It is thus wondered whether their existence bases on regulations protecting them. But fishing along the coast of Norway also preserves a traditional lifestyle and gives the chance to choose it. And is bigger better anyway? Answering such questions requires knowledge. Interestingly, there is little academic attention paid to the coastal NEAC fishery in Norway in the literature. This is puzzling since it catches around seventy per cent of the total catch in Norway each year. It is first asked whether neoclassical modelling is appropriate in the given context. Next, a partial-equilibrium neoclassical model is developed. Since the vessels do not only fish cod but a multitude of species, a multi-output framework is appropriate. Thirdly, the empirical model, a system of linear regression equations is estimated by iterative seemingly unrelated regression estimation. The empirical results paint a picture of a flexible fishery. Fishermen strongly react on price changes by shifting targets. Vessels are apparently also able to circumvent the capital restrictions by substituting away from it. Cod cannot be viewed as a fishery of its own: fishermen would not harvest it the way they do were it not for haddock. This implies that bio-economic modelling of cod only is inappropriate. Neither could a composite ‘fishing effort’ be supported. Finally, since saithe is nonjoint, the inclusion in the collective quota seems unjustified. The current study could be seen as groundwork in establishing the ‘economic side’ of a bio-economic model of the NEAC fishery. It can also be regarded as a basis for fisheries management in other ways, be it for the result that saithe can economically be seen as independent or for the ‘flexibility’ uncovered in the coastal fishery...|$|R
