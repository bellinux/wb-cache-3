5|$|By now aged nearly 56, Kruger {{resolved}} that {{he could}} no longer travel constantly between Boekenhoutfontein and the capital, and in August 1881 he and Gezina moved to Church Street, Pretoria, from where he could easily walk to the government offices <b>on</b> <b>Church</b> Square. Also around this time he shaved off his moustache and most of his facial hair, leaving the chinstrap beard he kept thereafter. His and Gezina's permanent home <b>on</b> <b>Church</b> Street, what is now called Kruger House, would be completed in 1884.|$|E
5|$|In late 1973, {{following}} {{the sudden death of}} church president Harold B. Lee, Kimball became the twelfth {{president of the}} LDS Church, a position he held until his death, in 1985.

5|$|After {{retiring}} {{as college}} president in 1886, Thompson remained active in school, party, and church affairs. He became {{a director of}} the Ohio State Archaeological and Historical Society in 1885 and prepared their exhibit at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. He wrote several books <b>on</b> <b>church</b> topics, including Our Bishops: A Sketch of the Origin and Growth of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, published in 1889. In 1901, he was elected editor of the United Brethren Review. He died in Dayton, Ohio on July 8, 1920, and was buried at Westerville, Ohio's Otterbein Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|After this, {{tensions}} rose between Conrad and Lothair due to diverging views <b>on</b> <b>church</b> politics. Lothair visited Italy in 1132-33, and was crowned emperor by Innocent II on 4 June 1133. In his absence, Conrad {{was ordained}} an archbishop. This directly infringed on the emperor's right, recently {{confirmed by the}} Pope, to invest a bishop with his regalia before he was ordained. It earned a stern rebuke from Lothair.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the change in maintenance, NY360 became part of four {{unsigned}} county routes. On Morton Road, NY360 was co-designated as County Route279 (CR279). The portion on Redman Road was part of CR236, which extends from NY31 west of Brockport to Cook Road near the Lake Ontario State Parkway. The section of NY360 <b>on</b> <b>Church</b> Road overlapped with CR277. Finally, the part of NY360 on Lake Road West Fork was concurrent with CR234, which extends north past NY360 to Moscow Road (CR211). All four overlaps were eliminated when the NY360 designation was officially removed in February 2012, and the NY 360 shields were removed by June of that year.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{industrial}} architecture Hunslet {{has a history}} for some notable churches. The main steeple <b>on</b> <b>Church</b> Lane was once {{part of a large}} church. All but the steeple were demolished in the 1970s and a smaller church building attached. Meadow Lane in Hunslet was also home to Christ Church, an architecturally notable Gothic church, which has since been demolished.|$|E

5|$|Chiswick {{grew up as}} {{a village}} around St Nicholas Church from c. 1181 <b>on</b> <b>Church</b> Street, its {{inhabitants}} practising farming, fishing and other riverside trades including a ferry, important as there were no bridges between London Bridge and Kingston throughout the Middle Ages.

5|$|Helped by a {{scholarship}} from {{the bishop of}} his home diocese, Fauré boarded at the school for 11 years. The régime was austere, the rooms gloomy, the food mediocre, and the required uniform elaborate. The musical tuition, however, was excellent. Niedermeyer, whose goal was to produce qualified organists and choirmasters, focused <b>on</b> <b>church</b> music. Fauré's tutors were Clément Loret for organ, Louis Dietsch for harmony, Xavier Wackenthaler for counterpoint and fugue, and Niedermeyer for piano, plainsong and composition.|$|E

5|$|In 1932, Filitti, {{who kept}} a vivid {{interest}} in Romanian Orthodox history, published Biserici și ctitori ("Churches and Ktitors"). He was preoccupied with similar thoughts {{when he decided}} to sponsor the rebuilding and refurbishing of two ancestral churches: the Dormition Church in Slatina, originally built by his Slătineanu relatives (whom he commemorated with a coat of arms, displayed over the church entrance); and the Sfântul Dumitru de Jurământ Metochion of Constandie Filitti (whom he had reburied <b>on</b> <b>church</b> premises).|$|E
5|$|In {{downtown}} Adrian, {{the highways}} previously split into an uncommon arrangement of one-way streets. This arrangement {{was similar to}} a traffic circle in how the traffic was routed through the central business district <b>on</b> <b>Church,</b> Broad, Front and Winter streets. The first one-way pairing started on Main Street at the intersection with Winter Street. Northbound traffic continued on Main Street, while southbound traffic was routed along Winter Street. At Church Street, westbound Bus. US223/northbound M-52 turned east for a block <b>on</b> <b>Church</b> and then north onto Broad Street. Then the highway designations continued on Broad Street three blocks north to Front Street, passing {{to the east of}} the downtown businesses. The designations were then routed west along Front Street. At Main Street, M-52 turned back north again as a two-way street. In the opposite direction, southbound M-52 traffic was diverted from Main west on Front Street. Front Street west of Main Street carried southbound M-52 and westbound Bus. US223 traffic one block west to Winter Street, which then turned down Winter. Westbound Bus. US223 traffic turned west along Maumee Street while eastbound Bus. US223 followed southbound M-52 down Winter to Main Street. This arrangement was ended in November 2009 when the City of Adrian converted all of the one-way streets to two-way traffic. Downtown streets had been converted to one-way traffic between 1950 and 1973.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the petition, the council set up a commission that proposed a city synod. For this gathering, Bucer provided a draft document of sixteen articles <b>on</b> <b>church</b> doctrine. The synod convened on 3 June 1533 at the Church of the Penitent Magdalens to debate Bucer's text, eventually accepting it in full. Sectarian leaders were brought before the synod and questioned by Bucer. Ziegler was dismissed and allowed to stay in Strasbourg; Hoffmann was imprisoned as {{a danger to the}} state; and Schwenckfeld left Strasbourg of his own accord.|$|E

5|$|Sorrell {{explained}} that, {{during the}} marketing campaign, the team were frequently {{asked to go}} to graveyards for photo-shoots.

They lied by telling him that they were students filming a documentary on churches. Marketing campaigns also incorporated Sony Cambridge Studio's humour.|$|E

5|$|The Reformation had {{a severe}} impact <b>on</b> <b>church</b> music. The song {{schools of the}} abbeys, cathedrals and collegiate churches were closed down, choirs disbanded, music books and manuscripts {{destroyed}} and organs removed from churches. The Lutheranism that influenced the early Scottish Reformation attempted to accommodate Catholic musical traditions into worship, drawing on Latin hymns and vernacular songs. The most important product of this tradition in Scotland was The Gude and Godlie Ballatis (1567), which were spiritual satires on popular ballads composed by the brothers James, John and Robert Wedderburn. Never adopted by the kirk, they nevertheless remained popular and were reprinted from the 1540s to the 1620s.|$|E
