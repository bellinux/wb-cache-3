40|$|AIM: This study {{investigates the}} nature, frequency, and <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> {{relating}} to misconduct laid against oral healthcare professionals (OHPs), charged with misconduct in South Africa. METHODS: Records of the Health Professions Council of South Africa (2004 - 2009) were analysed and classified using the ethical rules as a reference. “Clinically-related complaints” and “fraud” were added as extra categories. The nature and {{outcome of the}} complaints and the penalties were quantified, and the detailed nature of the complaints was qualitatively reported. RESULTS: Two percent of the registered dentists and 5. 5 % of the registered dental therapists were charged with misconduct. Clinically related complaints (59 %) and fraud (29 %) were most prevalent amongst the accused dentists. Fraud (46 %), clinically related complaints (19 %), advertising (15 %), infection control (8 %), and creating expectations {{that could not be}} met (8 %) were the most common complaints against dental therapists. CONCLUSIONS: Substandard dental treatment and fraud were the main reasons for patient dissatisfaction that led to OHPs being charged with misconduct. Both these undesirable practices may be financially motivated. OHPs should take cognisance of these statistics and should adjust their professional approach accordingly in order to reflect acceptable ethical behaviour[URL]...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo assess families’ health {{problems}} and the health facility choices in an urban and a rural district in Egypt. MethodsA cross-sectional descriptive study with a multi-stage random sample of 948 urban and 401 rural households was undertaken in a district of Cairo and rural Giza. Data was collected through interviews. The questionnaire addressed {{health problems}} {{and the use of}} health services within the fortnight prior to the survey. A follow-up of a sub-sample of 285 urban and 114 rural households was carried out 2 – 3 weeks after the first interview to assess the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>complaints.</b> The EPi Info Statistical Package was used for analysis and comparing urban and rural families. ResultsOver 60 % of urban and 78. 8 % of rural families had health complaints - respiratory, gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal. Outpatient clinics in public hospitals were the first choice for 49. 7 % of urban families and 23 % of rural, while 25. 7 % of urban and 42. 8 % of rural families visited private clinics. Over half of the families with complaints recover from their illnesses within a fortnight. ConclusionUrban families have less health complaints than rural; however, rural families recover sooner. Families bypass often public primary health care services. Urban families overuse outpatient clinics in public hospitals...|$|E

The {{vast majority of the}} 125, 000 discipline complaints received annually are disposed of without an opportunity for the public to observe the process or the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>complaints.</b> Heavy reliance on confidential dispositions - either through private sanctions or diversion programs - keeps most information about lawyer misconduct a secret from the public.

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the risk factors for medical malpractice is essential for implementing long-term prevention strategies. Certain physician characteristics have been reported to be associated with malpractice litigation. However, patient characteristics have not been fully investigated. Methods: We conducted a hospital-based case-control study. We reviewed a total of 147 cases in the inpatient risk management file (RMF) and 44, 045 inpatient controls. The RMF was opened if the patient's complaint may have led to legal action. We compared demographic data of RMF cases and controls to investigate the risk factors for filing a complaint. Outcomes of the RMF cases were classified as resolution, compensation, and lawsuit. Results: RMF cases were associated with admission via the emergency room (odds ratio [OR] = 1. 62, p = 0. 005), surgical specialty (OR = 1. 86, p = 0. 001) and living in an urban area (OR = 1. 93, p < 0. 001). Once RMF cases were filed, living in an urban area was the only independent factor for filing a lawsuit (OR = 4. 10, p = 0. 007). RMF cases with medical injury were more likely to reach compensation (OR = 10. 51, p < 0. 001) and to receive significantly higher compensation (p = 0. 007). The severity of medical injury was correlated positively with the likelihood of reaching compensation and the amount of compensation. Only 15. 0 % of RMF cases entered the litigation phase. Conclusion: Patients with certain characteristics tend to file complaints, receive compensation, or bring a case to court. Understanding of patient characteristics may be useful for predicting occurrence and <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> against physicians...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A common {{finding in}} several studies is patients' dissatisfaction with {{complaint}} handling in health care. The reasons why {{are for the}} greater part unknown. The key to an answer {{may be found in}} a better understanding of patients' expectations. We investigated patients' expectations <b>of</b> <b>complaint</b> handling in hospitals. METHODS: Subjects were patients who had lodged a complaint at the <b>complaint</b> committees <b>of</b> 74 hospitals in the Netherlands. A total of 424 patients (response 75 %) completed a written questionnaire at the start <b>of</b> the <b>complaint</b> procedures. Derived from justice theory, we asked what they expected from fair procedures, fair communication and fair <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>complaint</b> handling. RESULTS: The predominant reason for complainants to lodge a complaint was to prevent the incident from happening again. Complainants expected fair procedures from the complaint committee, in particular an impartial position. This was most important to 87 % of the complainants. They also expected to be treated respectfully. Furthermore, they expected the hospital and the professional involved to respond to their complaint. A change in hospital performances was the most wanted <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>complaint</b> handling, according to 79 % of the complainants. They also expected disclosure from the professionals. Professionals should admit a mistake when it had occurred. More complainants (65 %) considered it most important to get an explanation than an apology (41 %). Only 32 % of complainants expected the professional to make an effort to restore the doctor-patient relationship. A minority of complainants (7 %) wanted financial compensation. CONCLUSION: Nearly all complainants want to prevent the incident from happening again, not out of pure altruism, but in order to restore their sense of justice. We conclude that complaint handling that does not allow for change is unlikely to meet patients' expectations. Secondly, complaint handling should not be left exclusively to complaint committees, the responses of hospital and professionals are indispensable. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

De-identified data concerning complaints about medical practitioners who had graduated from the University of Queensland, made to the Medical Board of Queensland between 1968 and 2006, were analysed. The main outcome measures were category <b>of</b> <b>complaint,</b> total complaint rate per doctor-year, frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> per practitioner and <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>complaints.</b> There were 12 categories <b>of</b> <b>complaints,</b> encompassing different aspects of clinical management, impairment and unethical conduct.

40|$|The {{quality of}} care in nursing homes has been {{evaluated}} from many varying perspectives, but few studies have analyzed quality in light <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> made to state survey agencies by residents, their family members, or other individuals interacting with the nursing home. This study analyzed <b>complaints,</b> investigation <b>of</b> <b>complaint</b> allegations, and complaint-related deficiency citations to determine their effect, if any, on the {{quality of care}} in nationwide nursing homes. Using the Online Survey Certification and Reporting (OSCAR) survey dataset for facility characteristics and the complaint investigation dataset for <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>complaint</b> investigation, analyses conducted included descriptives, correlations, conceptual mapping for complaint-related deficiencies, chi-square tests of independence, t-tests, and generalized estimating equations. At baseline, approximately 66 % of nursing homes were for-profit and roughly 53 % belonged to a chain membership, while the average percent of residents receiving Medicaid for care reimbursement was 60 %. Results indicated that nursing homes differed significantly by profit status and chain membership on whether a complaint was received and whether a deficiency citation was issued following a complaint investigation. Additionally, certain facility and resident-aggregated characteristics, as indicated by odds ratios, were associated with an increase in the likelihood <b>of</b> receiving a <b>complaint</b> or a complaint-related citation. With respect to facility characteristics, for-profit nursing homes and those nursing homes belonging to a chain membership were found to have more complaints and more complaint-related deficiency citations than nonprofit nursing homes and non-chain facilities. Resident-aggregated characteristics, such as a nursing home having more residents restrained, more residents with a catheter, or more residents with a diagnosis of depression, indicated a greater likelihood <b>of</b> receiving a <b>complaint</b> or complaint-related deficiency citation in longitudinal analyses. While additional research could aid in interpreting the effect <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> on quality <b>of</b> care in nursing homes, study results indicate several facility and resident-aggregated factors that may aid in better understanding of quality of care and improve the training of surveyors and nursing home staff to improve quality of care for residents...|$|R

40|$|Master of EducationThis thesis investigates {{communication}} between {{doctors and patients}} when unexpected problems occur. When a treatment outcome is not as expected {{and there are no}} adequate explanations given, patient dissatisfaction and disappointment can lead to complaints to the Health Services Commissioner (HSC).

The study used extracts from the document files to code the communication aspects <b>of</b> the <b>complaints</b> through content analysis of the extracts using keywords based on a communication model developed by Northouse and Northouse in 1985. The findings indicated a staged model <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> resolution, including the response to the initial incident with a breakdown in professional relationship, followed by guarded attempts at explanation leading finally to open attempts at resolution.

40|$|Background Patients who submit {{complaints}} about the healthcare they have received are often dissatisfied with the response to their complaints. This is usually attributed {{to the failure of}} physicians to respond adequately to what complainants want, e. g. an apology or an explanation. However, expectations <b>of</b> <b>complaint</b> handling among the public may colour how they evaluate the way their own complaint is handled. This descriptive study assesses expectations <b>of</b> <b>complaint</b> handling in healthcare among the public and physicians. Negative public expectations and the gap between these expectations and those of physicians may explain patients’ dissatisfaction with complaints procedures. Methods We held two surveys; one among physicians, using a panel of 3366 physicians (response rate 57 %, containing all kinds of physicians like GP’s, medical specialist and physicians working in a nursing home) and one among the public, using the Dutch Healthcare Consumer Panel (n = 1422, response rate 68 %). We asked both panels identical questions about their expectations <b>of</b> how <b>complaints</b> are handled in healthcare. Differences in expectation scores between the public and the physicians were tested using non-parametric tests. Results The public have negative expectations about how complaints are handled. Physician’s expectations are far more positive, demonstrating large expectation gaps between physicians and the public. Conclusions The large expectation gap between the public and physicians means that when they meet because <b>of</b> <b>complaint,</b> they are likely to start off with opposite expectations of the situation. This is no favourable condition for a positive <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> a <b>complaints</b> procedure.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 56 - 59). Quality of {{care has}} been a topic of concern in assisted living facilities, known as Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly (RCFEs) in California, for both policy makers and researchers. Research has shown that quality is difficult to measure and measurement systems implemented at a policy level are varied, and often insufficient for research purposes. Without knowledge on how policy impacts quality of care, {{it is difficult to}} identify and implement effective policies in assisted living facilities. This study examined how a 2004 policy change in California which reduced the number of unannounced inspection visits from once annually to once every five years, may have impacted quality of care in a sample of 83 RCFEs in San Diego County. Eight hundred eighty six facility inspection reports from a sample of 83 facilities in San Diego County were analyzed to find the number of deficiencies cited and the number <b>of</b> <b>complaint</b> investigation visits from January 2000 through December 2006. Complaint investigation visits and deficiencies were <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> interest in this analysis and proxies for quality of care measures. No significant differences were found in the frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaint</b> investigation visits for all facilities or for any individual facility characteristic before and after the policy change. The average number <b>of</b> <b>complaint</b> investigation visits increased overall after the policy change. Individual facility characteristics had varied <b>outcomes,</b> with frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaint</b> investigation visits increasing in some types of facilities and decreasing in others. Significant increases in cited deficiencies were found for facilities licensed 12 months or fewer before the policy change (p= 0. 040), facilities licensed longer than 37 months before the policy change (p= 0. 022), 7 to 15 bed facilities (p= 0. 024), and 50 - 99 bed facilities (p= 0. 045). A significant decrease in cited deficiencies was found for facilities with an ownership status of individual or sole proprietorship (p= 0. 012). Since quality of care is a complex concept to measure, it is recommended that the policy impact be researched further in order to assess why this shift in deficiencies and occurred for some types of facilities and not others...|$|R
40|$|It {{is vital}} for every service {{provider}} to get feedback from its customers. This is especially important when a customer has perceived an unfavourable service experience. One way to receive feedback from these customers is to encourage and {{make it easy for}} them to complain. Scholarly knowledge about complaint behaviour gives the service provider valuable insight about service problems and how to improve e. g. service offerings, service processes and interactions, to increase customer satisfaction, loyalty and profit. For that reason it is argued that customers who have an unfavourable service experience should be encouraged to complain, because if not, the provider risks losing the customer and thus future revenue. Previous research within complaint behaviour has mainly focused on the static description of motivation, antecedents, or the <b>outcome</b> response <b>of</b> <b>complaint</b> behaviour. The research has mainly explored different features linked to the market, the provider, the service and/or individual customer’s issues. To learn more about the customer’s complaint behaviour {{there is a need to}} take a dynamic and processual approach. This may help providers to serve customers more correctly and prevent unfavourable service experiences. The main aim of this dissertation is to enhance the knowledge of the dynamic behavioural processes in customer complaint behaviour. The dissertation will contribute to conceptualise different aspects <b>of</b> customer <b>complaint</b> behaviour. In addition, the dissertation will give an empirical grounded understanding of contextual and emotional aspects that may help to recognize the complexity <b>of</b> the <b>complaint</b> behaviour process. The contribution is a portrayal of different models describing the dynamic process <b>of</b> <b>complaint</b> behaviour including a new customer complaint behaviour model. Customer complaint behaviour is viewed as action and reaction - as a dynamic adjustment process that occurs during and/or after the service interaction, rather as a post-purchase activity. In order to capture these adjustments, a new conceptual complaint model is suggested which holds three thresholds for complaint behaviour and emphasis three different behavioural categories in the complaint process. Further, the dissertation gives an explanation of contextual and emotional issues that influence the complaint behaviour. The dissertation also includes an epistemological framework to anchor the paradigmatic belongings of service research as a basis for the design of studies in the area <b>of</b> customer <b>complaint</b> behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Theme: Many reports {{stress the}} {{importance}} <b>of</b> solving customer <b>complaints</b> {{in order to maintain}} customer satisfaction, but also to learn from mistakes and further improve the customer service. However, relatively few empirical studies have been conducted regarding the effect of complains handling activities on customer satisfaction and on company-customer relationships. Objectives of research: This paper attempts to identify the main elements <b>of</b> the <b>complaints</b> handling strategy that are considered essential for customers, and their effect on customer satisfaction. Literature analysis/previous research: Previous studies define a complaint as a conflict between a consumer and a business organisation in which the fairness of the resolution procedures, the interpersonal communication and behaviour, and the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> the <b>complaint</b> resolution process are the principal evaluative criteria used by the customer. In our opinion, a complaint is not necessary a conflict, however, it can create a conflict between a customer and a business organisation, when the answer to the consumerâ€™s complaint is not satisfactory. Therefore, the way in which business organisations deal with consumer complaints can significantly influence the consumersâ€™ level of satisfaction and loyalty. Research methodology: The empirical analysis of primary data collected through face-to-face interviews with 150 French customers provides a detailed picture of the specific elements of complains handling which are perceived as important in four different settings defined in relation to the perceived importance of the product or service, and the emergency of the experienced problem. Results: The identified elements of the complaint-handling procedure have a variable importance from one element to the other, and in the context <b>of</b> various <b>complaint</b> situations. This finding highlights the fact that, depending on each situation, the factors that will determine customerâ€™s satisfaction, and that will shape the final perception <b>of</b> the <b>complaint</b> service, will be different. On the other hand, the study presents and discusses the effect of various dimensions <b>of</b> the <b>complaints</b> handling strategy on the customer satisfaction. Implications: The findings of this study indicate the specific elements that should be improved by companies in order to enhance the quality of the complaint-handling process in various transactional situations. Contribution of author/authors: The present paper compares the importance of the various dimensions already identified by researchers in relation to four different situations defined by the variation of two subjective dimensions: the importance associated by the customer to the product and the emergency level of the product/service failure...|$|R
5000|$|Peer {{moved up}} to New York City in 1973, where she {{continued}} writing for Newsweek. A cover story she wrote on Barbara Walters won a Page One Award the following year. One <b>of</b> the <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> the EEOC <b>complaint</b> was an agreement from Newsweek to promote a woman to senior editor. Peer was the obvious candidate. She had acted as one in early 1974 while the incumbent was on vacation (Peer's characteristic comment was that she [...] "survived without any great disgrace"). Both Oz Elliott and Katharine Graham, President of the Washington Post Company, favored Peer for the position. Newsweek gave Peer a tryout in late 1974, the result {{of which is a}} matter of dispute. Peer later claimed that she was offered the job but turned it down. Edward Kosner, then managing editor, claimed later that Peer was [...] "very talented...but she wasn't a good manager", and Lynn Povich recounts a story that Peer's tryout ended when Peer threw an ashtray at someone.|$|R
