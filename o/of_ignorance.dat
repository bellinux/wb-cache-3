5|$|Atman is the {{predominantly}} discussed {{topic in the}} Upanishads, but they express two distinct, somewhat divergent themes. Some state that Brahman (Highest Reality, Universal Principle, Being-Consciousness-Bliss) is identical with Atman, while others state Atman is part of Brahman but not identical. This ancient debate flowered into various dual, non-dual theories in Hinduism. The Brahmasutra by Badarayana (~ 100 BCE) synthesized and unified these somewhat conflicting theories, stating that Atman and Brahman are different in some respects particularly during the state <b>of</b> <b>ignorance,</b> but at the deepest level and {{in the state of}} self-realization, Atman and Brahman are identical, non-different.|$|E

5|$|The Museum of Curiosity, {{formerly}} titled The Professor of Curiosity, is {{a comedy}} panel game on BBC Radio 4 that was first broadcast on 20 February 2008. It is hosted by John Lloyd (Professor <b>of</b> <b>Ignorance</b> at the University of Buckingham, and later at Southampton Solent University). He {{acts as the}} head of the (fictional) titular museum, while a panel of three guests – typically a comedian, an author and an academic – each donate to the museum an ‘object’ that fascinates them. The radio medium ensures that the suggested exhibits can be absolutely anything, limited only by the guests’ imaginations.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} put on hold in March 2012, as New Regency hired Iñárritu to direct an {{adaptation}} of Flim-Flam Man, Jennifer Vogel's non-fiction book about her criminal father. Penn was also under consideration for the lead role in that film. In December 2012, Iñárritu announced that his next film would be Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue <b>of</b> <b>Ignorance),</b> a comedy-drama about an actor who once played a famous superhero. For his work, Iñárritu won the Oscar for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay, and the film won Best Picture. Filming took place in March 2013. Iñárritu was scheduled to begin production on The Revenant after Birdman wrapped.|$|E

5|$|Alternate {{theories}} of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to {{theories of}} just war. Aikido, pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. Morihei Ueshiba, {{the founder of}} Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa. According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume {{that the world is}} free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out <b>of</b> <b>ignorance,</b> error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.|$|E

5|$|Supporters {{said that}} the {{publication}} of the cartoons was a legitimate exercise of free speech regardless of the validity of the expression, {{that it was important to}} openly discuss Islam without fear or that the cartoons made important points about topical issues. The Danish tradition of relatively high tolerance for freedom of speech became a focus of some attention. The controversy ignited a debate about the limits of freedom of expression in all societies, religious tolerance and the relationship of Muslim minorities with their broader societies in the West, and relations between the Islamic World in general and the West. Critics of the cartoons described them as Islamophobic, racist, or baiting and blasphemous to Muslims, possibly intended to humiliate a Danish minority. Others saw them as a manifestation <b>of</b> <b>ignorance</b> about the history of Western imperialism, double standards, and stereotyping.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{similarities}} between the Hellenistic wall paintings at Delos and the First Style of Pompeii, Joyce contends that the differences in Delian and Pompeian mosaics are the deliberate product of artistic preference rather than the result <b>of</b> <b>ignorance</b> of each other's traditions. These differences include the widespread use of opus signinum at Pompeii, with only four known examples at Delos; the use of opus sectile at Pompeii and its complete absence at Delos; the prevalent use of polychrome patterns and intricate, three-dimensional figured designs in Delian mosaics versus two-dimensional designs at Pompeii, which at best utilize two colors. Complex three-dimensional figured mosaics using polychrome designs to achieve the illusion of light and shadow weren't produced at Pompeii until the Pompeian Second Style of wall painting (80-20 BC) and are considered an adoption from Hellenistic art trends. While lead strips were used in Hellenistic mosaics of Delos, Athens, and Pella (Greece), Pergamon (Turkey), Callatis (Romania), Alexandria (Egypt), and Chersonesus (the Crimean peninsula), they are absent in Western Mediterranean mosaics of Malta, Sicily, and the Italian peninsula. Westgate affirms that Hellenistic mosaics can be divided into two broad categories: eastern and western, based on their different styles and production techniques.|$|E
5|$|Having {{identified}} the culprit as Adachi, the party chases and locates him within the TV world. Adachi explains that his actions {{were out of}} both boredom {{and the belief that}} humanity is better off believing what it wants; his claims are dismissed by the party as the rantings of a madman. After fighting Adachi, he is possessed by Ameno-sagiri, the Japanese God of Fog, who reveals that the fog is harmful to people and will eventually cause humanity to fall into a permanent state <b>of</b> <b>ignorance</b> and transform into Shadows. Upon his defeat, he agrees to lift the fog, congratulating the party on their resolve. Defeated, the wounded Adachi agrees to assume responsibility for his actions and turns himself in. The game moves forward to the day before the protagonist must travel home. If the player returns to the Dojima residence, the game ends with the party sending the protagonist off as he departs Inaba. Alternatively, should the player be able to identify the unexplained cause of the Midnight Channel and attempt to resolve this plot element, the protagonist meets with the party, and together they decide to end the case for good.|$|E

Carlos Carrera and Fernández hold {{the record for}} most wins in the category, with four each. Carerra's El Crimen del Padre Amaro was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2003. Since 1976, Felipe Cazals has been nominated at least once every decade, winning three times for El Año de la Peste (1980), Bajo la metralla (1984), and Las Vueltas del Citrillo (2006). Buñuel and Amat Escalante won the Ariel for Best Director and the same award at the Cannes Film Festival for Los Olvidados and Heli, respectively. Alejandro González Iñárritu was awarded the Ariel for Amores Perros, and received the Academy Award for Best Director for Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue <b>of</b> <b>Ignorance)</b> and The Revenant. Since its inception, the award {{has been given to}} 38 directors. As of the 2017 ceremony, Tatiana Huezo is the most recent winner in this category, and the first female director, for her work on Tempestad.|$|E
5|$|The social {{contract}} theory of political philosopher John Rawls, developed {{in his work}} A Theory of Justice, was influenced by Kant's ethics. Rawls argued that a just society would be fair. To achieve this fairness, he proposed a hypothetical moment prior {{to the existence of}} a society, at which the society is ordered: this is the original position. This should take place from behind a veil <b>of</b> <b>ignorance,</b> where no one knows what their own position in society will be, preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result. Rawls' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free, equal, and moral; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality, which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice. Rawls dismissed much of Kant's dualism, arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics, once reformulated, is clearer without it—he described this as {{one of the goals of}} A Theory of Justice.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{phenomenon}} <b>of</b> pluralistic <b>ignorance</b> is discussed {{and it is}} argued why it is of relevance for epistemic logic and social psychology. Roughly put, pluralistic ignorance is the case {{when a group of}} interacting agents all experience a discrepancy between their private opinions and the perceived opinions of the others. After introducing the phenomenon, numerous features <b>of</b> pluralistic <b>ignorance</b> that are <b>of</b> interest for epistemic logic and social epistemology, are discussed. This discussion serves two purposes: It recaps the existing research on pluralistic ignorance within epistemic logic and social epistemology, {{while at the same time}} stating open problems for social epistemology and epistemic logic that pertains to the study <b>of</b> pluralistic <b>ignorance.</b> Finally, it is argued that the features <b>of</b> pluralistic <b>ignorance</b> <b>of</b> interest to epistemic logic and social epistemology relate to general features of information dynamics in situations of social interaction...|$|R

40|$|Pluralistic {{ignorance is}} a socio-psychological {{phenomenon}} that involves a systematic discrepancy between people’s private beliefs and public behavior in certain social contexts. Recently, pluralistic ignorance has {{gained increased attention}} in formal and social epistemology. But to get clear on what precisely a formal and social epistemological account <b>of</b> pluralistic <b>ignorance</b> should look like, we need answers to at least the following two questions: What exactly is the phenomenon <b>of</b> pluralistic <b>ignorance?</b> And can the phenomenon arise among perfectly rational agents? In this paper, we propose answers to both these questions. First, we characterize different versions <b>of</b> pluralistic <b>ignorance</b> and define the version that we claim most adequately captures the examples cited as paradigmatic cases <b>of</b> pluralistic <b>ignorance</b> in the literature. In doing so, we will stress certain key epistemic and social interactive aspects of the phenomenon. Second, given our characterization <b>of</b> pluralistic <b>ignorance,</b> we argue that the phenomenon can indeed arise in groups of perfectly rational agents. This, in turn, ensures that the tools of formal epistemology can be fully utilized to reason about pluralistic ignoranc...|$|R
