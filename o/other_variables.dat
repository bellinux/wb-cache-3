5|$|Two two-player {{gameplay}} variations {{exist and}} are activated by modifying the Atari 2600's difficulty switches. There is an alternating version where players take turns shooting the clay pigeons, and another variation features one player shooting {{while the other}} controls {{the angle of the}} clay pigeons. <b>Other</b> <b>variables</b> that can be changed are the position of the shooter and the direction the bird will enter the screen from.|$|E
5|$|Covered {{interest}} rate parity is a no-arbitrage condition in foreign exchange markets which {{depends on the}} availability of the forward market. It can be rearranged to give the forward exchange rate {{as a function of the}} <b>other</b> <b>variables.</b> The forward exchange rate depends on three known variables: the spot exchange rate, the domestic {{interest rate}}, and the foreign interest rate. This effectively means that the forward rate is the price of a forward contract, which derives its value from the pricing of spot contracts and the addition of information on available interest rates.|$|E
5|$|Experimental research: The {{researcher}} isolates {{a single}} social process and reproduces it {{in a laboratory}} (for example, by creating a situation where unconscious sexist judgements are possible), seeking {{to determine whether or}} not certain social variables can cause, or depend upon, <b>other</b> <b>variables</b> (for instance, seeing if people's feelings about traditional gender roles can be manipulated by the activation of contrasting gender stereotypes). Participants are randomly assigned to different groups that either serve as controls—acting as reference points because they are tested with regard to the dependent variable, albeit without having been exposed to any independent variables of interest—or receive one or more treatments. Randomization allows the researcher to be sure that any resulting differences between groups are the result of the treatment.|$|E

50|$|Similarly, two {{absolutely}} continuous {{random variables}} are independent iffor all x and y. This means that acquiring {{any information about}} the value of {{one or more of the}} random variables leads to a conditional distribution of any <b>other</b> <b>variable</b> that is identical to its unconditional (marginal) distribution; thus no variable provides any information about any <b>other</b> <b>variable.</b>|$|R

25|$|Tea {{contains}} more caffeine than coffee by dry weight. A typical serving, however, contains much less, since tea is normally brewed more weakly than coffee. Also contributing to caffeine content are growing conditions, processing techniques, and <b>other</b> <b>variables.</b> Thus, teas contain varying amounts of caffeine.|$|E
25|$|Of {{all three}} {{factors that affect}} cost, street width, street length and {{pavement}} width, only street length is pattern dependent.
