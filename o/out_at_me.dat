2500|$|Hayakawa {{was known}} for his {{discipline}} and martial arts skills. While filming The Jaguar's Claws, in the Mojave Desert, Hayakawa played a Mexican bandit, with 500 cowboys as extras. On the first night of filming, the extras drank all night and well into the next day. No work was being done, so Hayakawa challenged the group to a fight. Two men stepped forward. Hayakawa said of the incident, [...] "The first one struck <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> I seized his arm and sent him flying on his face along the rough ground. The second attempted to grapple and I was forced to flip him over my head and let him fall on his neck. The fall knocked him unconscious." [...] Hayakawa then disarmed yet another cowboy. The extras returned to work, amused by the way the small man manhandled the big bruising cowboys.|$|E
60|$|I saw the red {{face and}} the kindly, light-blue eyes looking <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|They {{passed me}} a photograph. A trim young fellow, in soldier's garb looked <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{laughter}} faded at once, and {{her great}} seriousness looked <b>out</b> again <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> pleading.|$|R
60|$|Passing of {{an evening}} I have seen his dark, grim figure flitting about {{in the shadow of}} the trees, or caught a glimpse of his hard, angular, swarthy face peering <b>out</b> suspiciously <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from behind the bars.|$|R
60|$|I don't {{think he}} {{recognized}} me, but he perceived immediately I meant attacking. He struck <b>out</b> <b>at</b> once <b>at</b> <b>me</b> a haphazard blow, and touched {{me on the}} cheek.|$|R
60|$|BURGE-LUBIN. Nobody, dear lad, nobody. Dont fly <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> It {{is evident}} that you have not read the American's book.|$|E
6000|$|... “An’ wot ’re you snifflin’ about?” {{he burst}} <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> with renewed rage. “’Cos you’ve ’urt yer pore little leg, pore little mamma’s darlin’.” ...|$|E
60|$|There was a {{movement}} and an exclamation from my right, and {{peering through the}} gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|My friend {{fell into}} a chair, put both legs {{straight}} <b>out,</b> and looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in speechless amazement for a second; then he burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.|$|R
6000|$|... "A dreary {{place and}} lonely," [...] thought he, [...] "and I can peer <b>out</b> things <b>at</b> <b>me</b> ease. I'll find <b>out</b> what's <b>at</b> the end o' that dark alley. They were so fearsome that we'd go into her room. Her room, indeed! When {{the other woman}} had a big lighted cave! They {{expected}} somebody to come back, did they? Well, blast their eyes, he's here!" ...|$|R
60|$|MISS SUSAN (tragically). William Smith! Phoebe, I {{tried to}} look ferocious, indeed I did, but he saw I was afraid, and before the whole school he put <b>out</b> his tongue <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'I was {{to drive}} them 'way,' she answered, {{advancing}} boldly against us with many flaps. 'You bad man!' she continued, flashing <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> 'you have broken granny's bolt.' ...|$|E
60|$|She blazed <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in an {{absolutely}} unexpected manner. Till {{now she had}} listened so calmly and asked her questions with such a notable absence of emotion that the outburst overwhelmed me.|$|E
6000|$|... "If there are, we'll have to {{be careful}} how we move around," [...] put in old Jerry. [...] "I don't want any of 'em to leap <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from behind a rock." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fear me, {{light of}} my life, the dad doesn't {{see eye to}} eye with you on that point. No, every time I get hold of a daisy, I give him another chance, but it always works <b>out</b> <b>at</b> 'He loves <b>me</b> not!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you ask him}} to come <b>out</b> to <b>me</b> <b>at</b> once, please?" [...] Rupert said. [...] "It is a {{most serious}} business, or you may be sure I should not ask." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well; {{just put}} saddles on {{to two of}} them. These lads will ride them; they are going <b>out</b> with <b>me</b> <b>at</b> once; they will hand them over to your masters." ...|$|R
60|$|I gazed {{and gazed}} at the little light-colored spot in the portico. I gave it form, light, feeling. I could see perfect features, blue eyes which looked <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> a form of simple grace.|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word, Marlow," [...] I cried, [...] "what are you flying <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{for like}} this? I wouldn't use an ill-sounding word about women, but what right have you {{to imagine that}} I am looking for gratitude?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I went talking on, {{laughing}} and joking, {{when all of}} a sudden she flew <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> How was I to know she was 'eart and soul in the movement? You never told me,' he added accusingly to his host.|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle George!" [...] said Rollo, [...] "Uncle George! Come {{and look}} <b>out</b> with <b>me</b> <b>at</b> the back window. There is {{a flock of}} sheep feeding in a green field away up in the sky!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In you, {{when you}} reached <b>out</b> and {{clutched}} <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> You could not down the primitive passion, and, for that matter, {{you did not}} know it was uppermost. But the expression on your face, I imagine, was very like that of a woman-stealing cave-man. Another instant, and I am sure you would have laid violent hands upon me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The long moss hangs perpetually; [...] Gray scalps of buried years; [...] Blue crabs steal <b>out</b> {{and stare}} <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> [...] And seem to gauge my fears; [...] I start {{to hear the}} eel swim by; [...] I shudder when the crane [...] Strikes at his prey; I turn to fly, [...] At drops of sudden rain.|$|R
60|$|Harry (From gate {{looking over}} {{shoulder}} at Bessie). He ain't likely to fly <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> is he? I would {{be afraid of}} laying my hands on him. The chaps are always telling me I don't know my own strength.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{confound}} it, Pollie, you {{are always}} flying <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>me!</b> I dare say she's a good girl--she looks it, {{but if you want}} me to say that she's good-looking, I can't be such a hypocrite even to please you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At first I was {{uncertain}} about it. But when I came back that way I looked again, and I caught him peeping <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{from one of}} the bar-room windows. As soon as he saw me look he dodged out of sight." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{was hanging}} <b>out</b> <b>at</b> Max Fish and Mars Bar and Motor City {{drinking}} with {{the few remaining}} people in New York who would still hang <b>out</b> with <b>me.</b> <b>At</b> this time the Beasties had Hello Nasty, which was doing incredibly well, and I just couldn't believe that Mario Caldato, Jr. was {{willing to work with}} me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Criminals, if {{you like}} it better. I have broken the law more than once. There is an unexecuted warrant <b>out</b> against <b>me</b> <b>at</b> the present moment. You may even see me marched off this steamer at Liverpool between two policemen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Remember to look <b>out</b> for <b>me</b> <b>at</b> York," [...] said Miss Desborough, {{extending}} her gloved hand. [...] "Good-by till then." [...] The {{young girl}} respectfully touched {{the ends of}} Miss Desborough's fingers, dropped a curtsy, and Miss Desborough rejoined the consul.|$|R
6000|$|... "'The calmness {{suddenly}} {{vanished from}} my tormentor's face and manner. His eyes were ablaze with mingled triumph and hate. [...] "You thought so, you poor fool!" [...] he hissed <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> across the table. [...] "Bah! {{you were a}} fool! You were easily deceived! Listen! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very {{much for}} the better! You were a horrid little brute. You used to terrify me. I never knew when {{you were going to}} bound <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from behind a tree or something. I {{remember}} your chasing me for miles, shrieking {{at the top of your}} voice!" ...|$|E
6000|$|And instantaneously Bob Halibut's red head loomed louringly <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> But I {{know little}} about husbands; and premonitions only impress us when they come true. Time was to prove that Pollie {{and her mother had}} made a prudent choice. Am I not now Mr Halibut's god-sister, so to speak? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Live {{a year at}} the Great Game {{and tell}} me that again! The wires will be <b>out</b> against <b>me</b> <b>at</b> Delhi, {{describing}} every tear and rag upon me. Twenty--a hundred, if need be--will have seen me slay that boy. And thou art useless!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ef ye hear o' anythin' happenin', ye'll know what's up," [...] he said, in a low, hoarse, but {{perfectly}} audible whisper. [...] "Me and them's {{bound to}} part company afore long. Tell the fellows at Deadman's Gulch to look <b>out</b> for <b>me</b> <b>at</b> any time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The scamps! They knew he {{was alive}} when he boarded the empty freight car! Why did they not come back and tell me! I suppose they expect to get that five hundred dollars <b>out</b> of <b>me</b> <b>at</b> Chambersburgh! Just wait till I see them!" ...|$|R
