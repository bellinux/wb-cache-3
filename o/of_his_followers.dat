5|$|It is {{unlikely}} that it was supernatural affairs and Paulinus' persuasion alone that caused Edwin to convert.

One story relates that during a stay with Edwin and Æthelburg at their palace in Yeavering, Paulinus spent 36days baptising new converts. Paulinus also was an active missionary in Lindsey, and his missionary activities help show the limits of Edwin's royal authority.|$|E

James Gibbs has also been suggested, as the spire of St Lawrence's {{is similar to that}} of St Martin-in-the-Fields in the City of Westminster, London. Sir Howard Colvin tentatively attributes the church to Roger Morris.|$|E
5|$|After he {{was told}} that the Dutch had {{followed}} him, Tiku ordered most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>followers</b> to return to Tondon while he and a group of fifteen, including his two wives, continued south.

This fortress fell at the end of March 1907 and Tiku began to work his way back to Tondon through the forest. He and the other leaders, Buginese and Torajan alike, were chased by Dutch troops. The other leaders capitulated to the Dutch and were sentenced to either three years in a prison in Makassar or exile to Buton. Tiku, meanwhile, stayed hidden in the forests.|$|E
