5|$|Hip and elbow {{dysplasia}} are common.

They are also prone to skin diseases, such as seasonal flank alopecia, vitiligo, and follicular cysts. Cancer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> is common in dark-colored dogs, with the most frequently occurring varieties being melanoma of the limbs and digits, and squamous cell carcinoma of the digit. This susceptibility occurs because melanoma {{is caused by a}} defect in the melanocytes, the cells that darken the color <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> Noncancerous skin tumors are also common.|$|E

5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are part}} of the body's {{integumentary}} system and serve to protect the body against germs. Sebaceous glands secrete acids that form the acid mantle. This is a very fine, slightly acidic film on the surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> that acts as a barrier to bacteria, viruses, and other potential contaminants that might penetrate the skin. The pH <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> is between 4.5 and 6.2, and this acidity helps to neutralise the primarily alkaline nature of contaminants.|$|E

5|$|Acne, {{also known}} as acne vulgaris, is a {{long-term}} skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin. It is characterized by blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, oily skin, and possible scarring. It primarily affects areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> with a relatively high number of oil glands, including the face, {{upper part of the}} chest, and back. The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.|$|E
5|$|Addison's disease {{refers to}} primary hypoadrenalism, {{which is a}} {{deficiency}} in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production by the adrenal gland. In the Western world, Addison's disease is most commonly an autoimmune condition, in which the body produces antibodies against cells of the adrenal cortex. Worldwide, the disease is more frequently caused by infection, especially from tuberculosis. A distinctive feature of Addison's disease is hyperpigmentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> which presents with other nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue.|$|E
