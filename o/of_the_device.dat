5|$|After the {{announcement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>device,</b> {{a lack of}} supply was evident. This was due to a shortage of components such as the screen. Reports emerged, stating that Sharp was unable to ship the screen before the debut of the iPhone 5, and other manufacturers reported {{that it was difficult}} to keep up with demand. As a result, the number of pre-orders rose due to the uncertainty of stock at retail stores, and the delivery dates for pre-orders were postponed to dates that were after the initial release date <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
