40|$|The {{combination}} of low permeability, <b>oil</b> <b>base</b> <b>mud</b> and near saturated oils presents {{one of the}} most challenging environments for fluid sampling with formation testers. Low permeability indicates that the drawdown while sampling will be high but this is contraindicated for oils that are close to saturation pressure. A logical response is to therefore reduce the flow rate but in wells drilled with OBM an unacceptably long clean-up time would result. The Pinda formation in Block 2 offshore Angola presents just such a challenge. Formation mobilities are in the low double or singledigits, saturation pressure is usually within a few hundred psi of formation pressure and borehole stability indicates that the wells must be drilled with <b>oil</b> <b>base</b> <b>mud.</b> In the course of several penetrations of the Pinda formation a number of attempts were made to acquire representative formation samples but were stymied due to either excessive drawdowns that corrupted the fluid or by excessive contamination levels that rendered the samples unsuitable for laboratory analysis.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the work is}} to study the dynamic behavior of gas expansion in marine risers. In case of well control situations in deep and ultra deep waters, gas influx shows no warnings if not little, making it difficult to handle the gas. It can be observed that the gas is completely soluble in the base oil of the drilling mud leaving no signs of the incident as observed from the surface. The dissolved gas starts to flash from the liquid when it experiences a reduction in pressure below the bubble point pressure of the system during circulation. Owing to the depth of the risers, gas may be trapped within the marine risers after successful shut-in of blow our preventers at the sea bed. Circulating the contaminated mud poses a major threat of explosive riser unloading when the gas expands rapidly when the hydrostatic pressure is not sufficient to contain the gas. This forms the basis of study of riser equilibrium point, above which a slight movement of gas can lead to riser unloading. Explicit and implicit models have been created to understand the dynamics of gas expansion during the circulation. Specific case of <b>oil</b> <b>based</b> <b>mud</b> when the gas is completely dissolved in the base oil is considered. To capture the time varying dynamics of the multiphase flow, drift flux models have been created for both water based and <b>oil</b> <b>based</b> <b>mud.</b> Effect of choke pressure and pressure losses due to friction and acceleration have been successfully investigated.

40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of exploratory wastes (drilling muds & cuttings) generated during the drilling of Igbokoda X and Igbokoda Y onshore oil wells, was studied by analyzing its total hydrocarbon (TPH), aliphatic hydrocarbon (AH), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) using gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS) method and metal contents using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). The aim was to determine their toxicity and possible impacts on their immediate environments of disposal. These drilled wastes generated from the drilling of Igbokoda X and Igbokoda onshore wells indicated an exceedingly very high values of AH compared with the values of PAHs in both the <b>oil</b> <b>based</b> and water <b>based</b> <b>muds</b> and cuttings respectively. These values of aliphatic is generally> 5000 mg/kg in all <b>oil</b> <b>based</b> sample types analyzed for the drilled muds and generally> 4000 mg/kg in all the sample types analyzed for the drilled cuttings. However, these values of the AH varied according to sample types with the water <b>based</b> drilled <b>mud</b> collected at the depth of 4121 - 10171 feet having values of> 6000 mg/kg while the value in the water based drilled cuttings is generally < 5000 mg/kg. Both the <b>oil</b> <b>based</b> drilled <b>mud</b> and cuttings have higher values of PAHs at the drilled samples collected between 0 - 4121 feet than deeper depth and composite samples. Iron (Fe) has the highest concentration followed by calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) with varying level of toxic metals like lead (Pb), Nickel (Ni) ...|$|R
40|$|Vegetable oil such as Jatropha {{has been}} shown to be a {{comparable}} alternative to diesel and mineral oils for environmentally friendly <b>oil</b> <b>based</b> drilling <b>mud.</b> However compatibility of the vegetable oils with the usual chemical additives is still a major challenge that calls for compatible and non-toxic substitutes. This study examined the suitability of hen egg yolk as a non-toxic emulsifier in invert emulsion drilling mud using vegetable oil continuous phase. 8 ml of the Egg yolk which was separated from the albumen was added dropwise as a primary emulsifier to a 70 / 30 oil-water ratio invert emulsion drilling mud formulated with Jatropha vegetable oil. The electrical stability was tested using electrical stability tester at the recommended test temperature of 48. 9 ºC and later at 120 ºC to check any variation at elevated temperature. The stability values in volts were 398 V and 289 V respectively. A similar formulation using a standard emulsifier (versacleanVB) an amidoamine gave stability values as 201 V and 188 V respectively indicating that higher stability was attained with the egg yolk. The viscosities of the mud samples were also tested giving plastic viscosities of 52 and 49 centipoise at 50 ºC for the egg yolk and verscleanVB emulsified muds respectively. This study indicates that egg yolk could serve as an emulsifier for vegetable <b>oil</b> <b>based</b> invert emulsion <b>mud</b> in line with non- toxic additives for environmental compatibility Keywords: Environmental compatibility, Invert emulsion mud, non-toxic additives, electrical stability, emulsion stability...|$|R
