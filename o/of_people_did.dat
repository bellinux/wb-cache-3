He beat Liberal Democrat Nicholas Pannell {{in the second round}} of counting with a total of 7,096 votes to Pannell's 5,197. After the election, Bye noted that [...] "it is quite clear from canvassing that a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not want an elected mayor." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{implication}} is that Kaminsky's syphilis was not cured in May 1888 but in remission, {{and he began to}} kill prostitutes as an act of revenge because it had affected his brain. However, Cohen's death certificate makes no mention of syphilis but gives the cause of death as [...] "exhaustion of mania" [...] with phthisis, a then prevalent form of pulmonary tuberculosis, as the secondary cause. Kaminsky might have died as an [...] "unknown" [...] as hundreds <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> each year in the late 19th century. That would account for Fido's inability to find a record of his death in England and Wales during the probable period of his life.|$|E

This figure is higher than England as a whole. Whilst 29.2% have no formal qualifications, which is a figure that is also higher than England as a whole. Of the adult population, aged between 16 and 74 years of age, 34.7% of people are economically inactive, whilst 5.4% are economically active, but unemployed. This gives a combined non-employment rate of 40.1% of the adult population. 59.9% of adults are, therefore, occupied with work, training or education, in one form or another. 95.3% of the population is White British, with the remainder being of other ethnicities.

60|$|Little Dorrit had {{sometimes}} thought, and now {{thought again}} as she retraced her steps up the staircase, {{that he had}} made his way too easily into her father's house. But so many and such varieties <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> the same, through Mr Dorrit's participation in his elder daughter's society mania, that it was hardly an exceptional case. A perfect fury for making acquaintances on whom to impress their riches and importance, had seized the House of Dorrit.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Dodd's two clerks saw him {{enter the}} store {{by the back}} door and he was very much {{interested}} in the new ploughs which were piled up in crates outside of it. Then he disappeared into his office and shut the door, and supposedly became very much absorbed in book-keeping. If any one called, he was out--any one. Plenty <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> call, but he was not disturbed--until ten o'clock. Mr. Dodd had a very sensitive ear, and he could often recognize a man by his step, and this man he recognized.|$|E

You must think, Fanny, that I am anxious about an only brother--especially when we have all had so much cause to be anxious about him; and don't you think it must be a delight to me to find that he is able to take pleasure in your society? I should be doubly pleased, doubly delighted, if I could please him myself. But I have not the vivacity to amuse him." ...|$|E
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. Vagabonds--that is it. I {{want to be}} a vagabond, a wanderer. As I can't {{leap from}} cloud to cloud I want to wander from road to road. That little path there by the clipped edge goes up to the highroad. I want to go up that path and to walk along the highroad, and so on and on and on, and to know all kinds <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> <b>Did</b> you ever think that the roads are the only things that are endless; that one can walk on and on and on, and never be stopped by a gate or a wall? They are the serpent of eternity. I wonder they have never been worshipped. What are the stars beside them? They never meet one another. The roads are the only things that are infinite. They are all endless.|$|E

Now and then a dictum would sound narrow and questionable, objections to books seemed mistaken, judgments of people hard, and without sufficient foundation; and when Mary tried to argue, she found herself decidedly set down, with as much confident superiority {{as if she had}} been still sixteen years old. Six years spent in going to the other side of the world, and in seeing so many varieties <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> <b>did</b> not seem to Aunt Melicent to have conferred half so much experience as sleeping every night in Bryanston Square, daily reading the Morning Post, and holding intercourse with a London world of a dozen old ladies, three curates, and a doctor.|$|E
