5|$|Wilder's colleague, {{paediatrician}} Mynie Peterman, later formulated {{the classic}} diet, with {{a ratio of}} one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight in children, 10–15g of carbohydrate per day, and the remainder <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat.</b> Peterman's work in the 1920s established the techniques for induction and maintenance of the diet. Peterman documented positive effects (improved alertness, behaviour and sleep) and adverse effects (nausea and vomiting due to excess ketosis). The diet proved to be very successful in children: Peterman reported in 1925 that 95% of 37 young patients had improved seizure control on the diet and 60% became seizure-free. By 1930, the diet had also been studied in 100 teenagers and adults. Clifford Barborka, also from the Mayo Clinic, reported that 56% of those older patients improved on the diet and 12% became seizure-free. Although the adult results are similar to modern studies of children, they did not compare as well to contemporary studies. Barborka concluded that adults were least likely {{to benefit from the}} diet, {{and the use of the}} ketogenic diet in adults was not studied again until 1999.|$|E

Fruit and vegetable consumption was obtained from a food frequency question-naire; the percentages <b>of</b> total <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat</b> and saturated <b>fat</b> were obtained <b>from</b> a 24 -h food recall.

40|$|BACKGROUND. Recent {{recommendations}} for Americans aged 2 and older {{call for a}} reduction in the average saturated fat intake to less than 10 % <b>of</b> <b>calories.</b> METHODS. Using 24 -hour dietary recalls collected from mothers of 4 - to 7 -year-old urban Latino children, we identified foods and dietary behavior patterns that distinguish children with higher and lower mean daily percentages <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> saturated <b>fat.</b> RESULTS. Compared with children in the lowest quintile of intake, children in the highest quintile consumed {{more than twice as much}} saturated <b>fat</b> per day <b>from</b> high-fat milk products (18. 5 g vs 7. 8 g), mostly from whole milk. They did not consume different kinds of milk or different amounts of milk per eating occasion, but on average they consumed milk more frequently (2. 8 vs 1. 6 eating occasions per day). Even children in the lowest quintile, on average, exceeded the 10 % <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> saturated <b>fat</b> currently recommended. If low-fat (1 % fat) milk had been substituted without other dietary changes, all but the highest two quintiles would have been within the recommended level. CONCLUSIONS. The substitution of low-fat for whole milk appears to be a key strategy for preschool children for achieving recommended levels of saturated fat intake...|$|R
5000|$|According to the National Academies Press, a high-fat diet {{can contain}} [...] "unacceptably high" [...] amounts of {{saturated}} fat, even if saturated fats from animal products and tropical oils are avoided.

For example, {{if a person}} chose fats with only 20% saturated fatty acids, setting fat intake at 35% of total calories would mean that 7% of calories would come from saturated fat. For this reason, the Institute of Medicine recommends consuming no more than 35% <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat.</b>|$|E

Diets were isocaloric with each containing an equal number <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> <b>fats.</b> Birds were reared in floor brooder pens and fed experimental diets from Day 1 to 21 and then assigned the same dietary treatments in one of two environmentally controlled chambers.

At 49 days of age, following 12 hour fast, birds were weighed and six birds from each treatment slaughtered and processed into market parts and abdominal fat pad harvested.

40|$|Obesity {{leads to}} a loss of muscle mass and {{impaired}} muscle regeneration. In obese individuals, pathologically elevated levels of prolyl hydroxylase domain enzyme 2 (PHD 2) limit skeletal muscle hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. Loss of local VEGF may further impair skeletal muscle regeneration. We hypothesized that PHD 2 inhibition would restore vigorous muscle regeneration in a murine model of obesity. Adult (22 -week-old) male mice were fed either a high-fat diet (HFD), with 60 % <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> derived <b>from</b> <b>fat,</b> or a regular diet (RD), with 10 % <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> derived <b>from</b> <b>fat,</b> for 16 [*]weeks. On day 5 following cryoinjury to the tibialis anterior muscle, newly regenerated muscle fiber cross-sectional areas were significantly smaller in mice fed an HFD as compared to RD, indicating an impaired regenerative response. Cryoinjured gastrocnemius muscles of HFD mice also showed elevated PHD 2 levels (twofold higher) and reduced VEGF levels (twofold lower) as compared to RD. Dimethyloxalylglycine, a cell permeable competitive inhibitor of PHD 2, restored VEGF levels and significantly improved regenerating myofiber size in cryoinjured mice fed an HFD. We conclude that pathologically increased PHD 2 in the obese state drives impairments in muscle regeneration, in part by blunting VEGF production. Inhibition of PHD 2 over activity in the obese state normalizes VEGF levels and restores muscle regenerative potential...|$|R
