25|$|Dominance versus <b>overdominance.</b> In applied {{genetics}} (selective {{and agricultural}} breeding), this controversy has reflected the century-long {{debate over whether}} dominance or <b>overdominance</b> provides the best explanation for heterosis (hybrid vigor).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Overdominance</b> hypothesis. Certain {{combinations}} of alleles {{that can be}} obtained by crossing two inbred strains are advantageous in the heterozygote. The <b>overdominance</b> hypothesis attributes the heterozygote advantage to the survival of many alleles that are recessive and harmful in homozygotes. It attributes the poor performance of inbred strains to a high percentage of these harmful recessives. The <b>overdominance</b> hypothesis was developed independently by Edward M. East (1908) and George Shull (1908).|$|E
50|$|<b>Overdominance</b> is a {{condition}} in genetics where the phenotype of the heterozygote lies outside the phenotypical range of both homozygous parents. <b>Overdominance</b> can also be described as heterozygote advantage, wherein heterozygous individuals have a higher fitness than homozygous individuals.|$|E
50|$|Polar <b>overdominance</b> is {{a unique}} form of {{inheritance}} originially described in livestock, with relevant examples in humans and mice being discovered shortly after. The term polar is used to describe this type of <b>overdominance</b> because the phenotype of the heterozygote is more prevalent than the other genotypes. This polarity is shown as differential phenotype is only present {{in one of the}} heterozygote configurations when the recessive allele is inherited in a parent of origin type fashion. Polar <b>overdominance</b> differs from regular <b>overdominance</b> (also known as heterozygote advantage) where both heterozygote genotypes display a phenotype that has increased fitness regardless of the parent of origin. Studying this type of inheritance could have practical applications in preventative medicine for humans as well as a variety of other agricultural applications.|$|E

5000|$|Crow writes, [...] "The current view ... is {{that the}} {{dominance}} hypothesis is the major explanation of inbreeding decline and the high yield of hybrids. There is little statistical evidence for contributions from <b>overdominance</b> and epistasis. But whether the best hybrids are getting an extra boost from <b>overdominance</b> or favorable epistatic contributions remains an open question." ...|$|E
50|$|Population {{geneticist}} James Crow believed, in {{his younger}} days, that <b>overdominance</b> {{was a major}} contributor to hybrid vigor. He undertook a retrospective review of the developing science. According to Crow, the demonstration of several cases of heterozygote advantage in Drosophila and other organisms first caused great enthusiasm for the <b>overdominance</b> theory among scientists studying plant hybridization. But <b>overdominance</b> implies that yields on an inbred strain should decrease as inbred strains are selected for the performance of their hybrid crosses, as the proportion of harmful recessives in the inbred population rises. Over the years, experimentation in plant genetics has proven that the reverse occurs, that yields increase in both the inbred strains and the hybrids, suggesting that dominance alone may be adequate to explain the superior yield of hybrids. Only a few conclusive cases of <b>overdominance</b> have been reported in all of genetics. Since the 1980s, as experimental evidence has mounted, the dominance theory has made a comeback.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{part of the}} {{inbreeding}} depression could not be due to deleterious alleles, but to an intrinsic advantage of being heterozygous compared to being homozygous for any available allele, which is known as <b>overdominance.</b> Inbreeding depression caused by <b>overdominance</b> cannot be purged, but {{seems to be a}} minor cause of overall {{inbreeding depression}}, although its actual importance is still a matter of debate.|$|E
5000|$|In genetics, underdominance (referred to in some {{texts as}} [...] "negative overdominance") is the {{opposite}} of <b>overdominance.</b> It is the selection against the heterozygote, causing disruptive selection and divergent genotypes. Underdominance exists in situations where the heterozygotic genotype is inferior in fitness to either the dominant or recessive homozygotic genotype. Compared to examples of <b>overdominance</b> in actual populations, underdominance is considered more unstable and may lead to the fixation of either allele.|$|E
50|$|A {{heterozygote}} advantage (heterozygous advantage) describes {{the case in}} which the heterozygous genotype has a higher relative fitness than either the homozygous dominant or homozygous recessive genotype. The specific case of {{heterozygote advantage}} due to a single locus is known as <b>overdominance.</b> In more general terms, <b>overdominance</b> is a condition in genetics where the phenotype of the heterozygote lies outside of the phenotypical range of both homozygote parents, and heterozygous individuals have a higher fitness than homozygous individuals.|$|E
50|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{specific}} case of fitness <b>overdominance,</b> where the fitness advantage of the cross is caused by being heterozygous at one specific locus alone.|$|E
50|$|Dominance versus <b>overdominance</b> is a {{scientific}} {{controversy in the}} field of genetics that has persisted for more than a century. These two alternative hypotheses were first stated in 1908.|$|E
5000|$|Muller, {{motivated}} by his {{concern about the}} effects of radiation on human populations, argued that heterosis is primarily the result of deleterious homozygous recessive alleles, the effects of which are masked when separate lines are crossed—this was the dominance hypothesis, part of what Dobzhansky labeled the classical position. Thus, ionizing radiation and the resulting mutations produce considerable genetic load even if death or disease does not occur in the exposed generation, {{and in the absence of}} mutation natural selection will gradually increase the level of homozygosity. Bruce Wallace, working with J. C. King, used the <b>overdominance</b> hypothesis to develop the balance position, which left a larger place for <b>overdominance</b> (where the heterozygous state of a gene is more fit than the homozygous states). In that case, heterosis is simply the result of the increased expression of heterozygote advantage. If overdominant loci are common, then a high level of heterozygosity would result from natural selection, and mutation-inducing radiation may in fact facilitate an increase in fitness due to <b>overdominance.</b> (This was also the view of Dobzhansky.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Heterozygote {{advantage}} {{is a major}} underlying mechanism for heterosis, or [...] "hybrid vigor", which is the improved or increased function of any biological quality in a hybrid offspring. Previous research, comparing measures of dominance, <b>overdominance</b> and epistasis (mostly in plants), found {{that the majority of}} cases of heterozygote advantage were due to complementation (or dominance), the masking of deleterious recessive alleles by wild-type alleles, as discussed in the articles Heterosis and Complementation (genetics), but there were also findings of <b>overdominance,</b> especially in rice. [...] More recent research, however, has established that there is also an epigenetic contribution to heterozygote advantage, primarily as determined in plants, though also reported in mice.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the early}} 1900s (as {{discussed}} in the article Dominance versus <b>overdominance)</b> two competing genetic hypotheses, not necessarily mutually exclusive, {{have been developed to}} explain hybrid vigor. More recently, an epigenetic component of hybrid vigor has also been established.|$|E
50|$|Another {{mechanism}} {{responsible for}} inbreeding depression is the fitness advantage of heterozygosity, {{which is known}} as <b>overdominance.</b> This can lead to reduced fitness of a population with many homozygous genotypes, {{even if they are}} not deleterious or recessive. Here, even the dominant alleles result in reduced fitness if present homozygously (see also hybrid vigour).|$|E
50|$|The first {{described}} occurrence of polar <b>overdominance</b> in sheep was shown after finding that a mutant Callipyge allele must be {{inherited from the}} father to cause a condition called muscle hypertrophy. Muscle hypertrophy in the offspring is caused {{by an increase in}} the size and proportion of muscle muscle fibers, namely the fast-twitch muscle fibers. This increase is generally located in the hind quarters and torso. Muscle hypertrophy only manifests itself in the offspring approximately one month after birth. Polar <b>overdominance</b> shows evidence of an imprinted locus displayed as the difference between the expression of heterozygote phenotypes in a parent-of-origin type fashion. It was discovered that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the DLK1-DIO3 imprinted gene cluster affects the gene expression of paternal allele-specific genes and several maternal allele-specific long noncoding RNA and microRNA. Ectopic expression of Delta-like 1 homologue (DLK1) and the gene 11/Retrotransposon-like 1 (PEG11/RTL1) which are Paternally expressed proteins in skeletal muscle are a hallmark of these mutant individuals.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{effective}} population is large, then {{a large number}} of alleles can be maintained. However, this result only holds for the neutral case, and is not necessarily true for the case when some alleles are subject to selection, i.e. more or less fit than others, for example when the fittest genotype is a heterozygote (a situation often referred to as <b>overdominance</b> or heterosis).|$|E
50|$|Dominance and <b>overdominance</b> have {{different}} {{consequences for the}} gene expression profile of the individuals. If over-dominance is the main cause for the fitness advantages of heterosis, then {{there should be an}} over-expression of certain genes in the heterozygous offspring compared to the homozygous parents. On the other hand, if dominance is the cause, fewer genes should be under-expressed in the heterozygous offspring compared to the parents. Furthermore, for any given gene, the expression should be comparable to the one observed in the fitter of the two parents.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two ways}} in which {{inbreeding}} depression can occur. The first of these is through dominance, where beneficial alleles are usually dominant and harmful alleles are usually recessive. The increased homozygosity resulting from inbreeding means that harmful alleles {{are more likely to}} be expressed as homozygotes, and the deleterious effects cannot be masked by the beneficial dominant allele. The second method through which inbreeding depression occurs is through <b>overdominance,</b> or heterozygote advantage. Individuals that are heterozygous at a particular locus have a higher fitness than homozygotes at that locus. Inbreeding leads to decreased heterozygosity, and therefore decreased fitness.|$|E
50|$|The partial {{dominance}} hypothesis in genetics {{states that}} inbreeding depression {{is the result}} of the frequency increase of homozygous deleterious recessive or partially recessive alleles. The partial dominance hypothesis can be explained by looking at a population that is divided into a large number of separately inbred lines. Deleterious alleles will eventually be eliminated from some lines and become fixed in other lines, while some lines disappear because of fixation of deleterious alleles. This will cause an overall decline in population and trait value, but then increase to a trait value that is equal to or greater than the trait value in the original population. Crossing inbred lines restores fitness in the <b>overdominance</b> hypothesis and a fitness increase in the partial dominance hypothesis.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of <b>overdominance,</b> because Mendel's second law (the law of segregation) {{necessarily}} results {{in the production of}} homozygotes (which are by definition in this case, less fit), this means that population will always harbor a number of less fit individuals, which leads to a decrease in the average fitness of the population. This is sometimes referred to as genetic load, in this case it is a special kind of load known as segregational load. Crow and Kimura showed that at equilibrium conditions, for a given strength of selection (s), that there would be an upper limit to the number of fitter alleles (polymorphisms) that a population could harbor for a particular locus. Beyond this number of alleles, the selective advantage of presence of those alleles in heterozygous genotypes would be cancelled out by continual generation of less fit homozygous genotypes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Overdominance</b> occurs if the {{heterozygote}} phenotype has {{a fitness}} advantage over both homozygotes ("heterozygote advantage" [...] or [...] "heterosis"). One example is sickle cell anemia. It {{is due to}} a mutation in the hemoglobin gene leading to sickle shape formation of red blood cells, causing clotting of blood vessels, restricted blood flow and reduced oxygen transport. At the same time, the mutation confers resistance to malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites, which are passed off in red blood cells after transmission to humans by mosquitoes. Hence, homozygote and heterozygote genotypes for the sickle-cell disease allele show malaria resistance, while the homozygote suffers from severe disease phenotype. The alternative homozygote, which does not carry the sickle cell disease allele, is susceptible to Plasmodium. As a consequence, the heterozygote genotype is selectively favored in areas with a high incidence of malaria.|$|E
50|$|By the mid-1960s, the {{techniques}} of biochemistry and molecular biology—in particular protein electrophoresis—provided a way to measure the level of heterozygosity in natural populations: a possible means to resolve the classical/balance controversy. In 1963, Jack L. Hubby published an electrophoresis study of protein variation in Drosophila; soon after, Hubby began collaborating with Richard Lewontin to apply Hubby's method to the classical/balance controversy by measuring the proportion of heterozygous loci in natural populations. Their two landmark papers, published in 1966, established a significant level of heterozygosity for Drosophila (12%, on average). However, these findings proved difficult to interpret. Most population geneticists (including Hubby and Lewontin) rejected the possibility of widespread neutral mutations; explanations that did not involve selection were anathema to mainstream evolutionary biology. Hubby and Lewontin also ruled out heterozygote advantage as the main cause because of the segregation load it would entail, though critics argued that the findings actually fit well with <b>overdominance</b> hypothesis.|$|E
50|$|More {{and more}} studies have {{identified}} QTL that show evidence of genomic imprinting in farm animals other than sheep. After polar overdominant inheritance was discovered {{to be the}} cause of muscular hypertrophy in sheep, the ortholog for the human DLK1 gene (DLK1-GTL2 intergenic region) was studied in Pigs to try {{to determine the effects of}} inheritance on ham weight. The original purpose of this study was to find the connection between genetics and ham weight to try to produce pigs that were abnormally large compared to the average. Before conducting this research, it was also hypothesized that the locus for ham weight was related to the ovine callipgye locus in sheep. After researching it was discovered that the two were regions were likely unrelated due to different forms of parental inheritance exhibited in both cases and a relatively large physical distance between the loci on the chromosome. Unlike the form of paternal polar <b>overdominance</b> that occurs in the ovine callipyge locus, the locus that controls ham weight operates in a maternal polar overdominant fashion.|$|E
50|$|The genetic {{dominance}} hypothesis {{attributes the}} superiority of hybrids to the masking of expression of undesirable (deleterious) recessive alleles from one parent by dominant (usually wild-type) alleles from the other (see Complementation (genetics)). It attributes the poor performance of inbred strains to the expression of homozygous deleterious recessive alleles. The genetic <b>overdominance</b> hypothesis states that some combinations of alleles (which {{can be obtained by}} crossing two inbred strains) are especially advantageous when paired in a heterozygous individual. This hypothesis is commonly invoked to explain the persistence of some alleles (most famously the Sickle cell trait allele) that are harmful in homozygotes. In normal circumstances, such harmful alleles would be removed from a population through the process of natural selection. Like the dominance hypothesis, it attributes the poor performance of inbred strains to expression of such harmful recessive alleles. In any case, outcross matings provide the benefit of masking deleterious recessive alleles in progeny. This benefit has been proposed to be {{a major factor in the}} maintenance of sexual reproduction among eukaryotes, as summarized in the article Evolution of sexual reproduction.|$|E
50|$|MEG3 (maternally {{expressed}} 3) is a maternally expressed, imprinted {{long non-coding}} RNA gene. At least 12 different isoforms of MEG3 are generated by alternative splicing. Expression of MEG3 {{is lost in}} cancer cells. It acts as a growth suppressor in tumour cells, and activates p53. A pituitary transcript variant {{has been associated with}} inhibited cell proliferation. Studies in mouse and sheep suggest that an upstream intergenic differentially methylated region (IG-DMR) regulates imprinting of the region. The expression profile in mouse of the co-regulated Meg3 and Dlk1 genes suggests a causative role in the pathologies found in uniparental disomy animals, characterized by defects in skeletal muscle maturation, bone formation, placenta size and organization and prenatal lethality. The sheep homolog is associated with the callipyge mutation which in heterozygous individuals affects a muscle-specific long-range control element located in the DLK1-GTL2 intergenic region and results in the callipyge muscular hypertrophy. The non-Mendelian inheritance pattern, known as polar <b>overdominance,</b> likely results from the combination of the cis-effect on the expression levels of genes in the DLK1-GTL2 imprinted domain, and trans interaction between the products of reciprocally imprinted genes.|$|E
40|$|Documented {{examples}} of heterosis attributable to <b>overdominance</b> at specific protein-encoding gene loci have rarely been reported, {{the association of}} sickle cell hemoglobin with malarial resistance being the best documented example of this phenomenon. Here we report an example of <b>overdominance</b> that is temperature- and allyl alcohol-dependent and due to heterozygosity at the ADH 1 locus, involving two ADHI functional mutants. <b>Overdominance</b> appears to be {{due in part to}} an intermediate level of ADHI activity in the heterozygote. Unlike previous work with this system using haploid strains, the NAD +/NADH ratios show no negative correlation with allyl alcohol resistance. This system is formally equivalent to that of sickle cell hemoglobin and shows promise as a tool for investigating the physiological basis for <b>overdominance...</b>|$|E
40|$|Chromosomal {{polymorphism}} can {{be maintained}} by means of genic dominance, genic <b>overdominance,</b> recombination effects and karyotype selection. Experiments were carried out which allow us to distinguish among these factors as they effect egg hatch and larva-to-adult survival in D. subobscura. A strong karotype selection was observed. A small but highly significant recombination effect was also observed {{despite the fact that}} the material used in the experiment consisted of inbred, related strains and was therefore less likely to show such an effect than strains randomly chosen from a population. On the other hand, these strains, being inbred, were more likely to show genic dominance or genic <b>overdominance</b> than randomly picked samples. However neither genic dominance nor genic <b>overdominance</b> was detected...|$|E
40|$|Single-gene <b>overdominance</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{mechanisms}} proposed to explain heterosis (i. e., hybrid vigor), the phenomenon that hybrid offspring between two inbred lines or varieties show superior phenotypes to both parents. Although sporadic examples of single-gene <b>overdominance</b> have been reported over the decades, the molecular nature of this phenomenon remains poorly understood and it is unclear whether any generalizable principle underlies the various cases. Through bulk segregant analysis, chemical profiling, and transgenic experiments, we show that loss-of-function alleles of the FLAVONE SYNTHASE (FNS) gene cause <b>overdominance</b> in anthocyanin-based flower color intensity in the monkeyflower species Mimulus lewisii. FNS negatively affects flower color intensity by competing with the anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes for the same substrates, yet positively affects flower color intensity by producing flavones, the colorless copigments required for anthocyanin stabilization, leading to enhanced pigmentation in the heterozyote (FNS/fns) relative to both homozygotes (FNS/FNS and fns/fns). We suggest that this type of antagonistic pleiotropy (i. e., alleles with opposing effects on different components of the phenotypic output) might be a general principle underlying single-gene <b>overdominance...</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{inheritable}} muscular hypertrophy {{was recently}} described in sheep and {{shown to be}} determined by the callipyge (CLPG) gene mapped to ovine chromosome 18. We demonstrate in this work that the callipyge phenotype is characterized by a non-Mendelian inheritance pattern, referred to as polar <b>overdominance,</b> in which only heterozygous individuals having inherited the CLPG mutation from their sire express the phenotype. The possible role of parental imprinting in the determinism of polar <b>overdominance</b> is envisaged...|$|E
40|$|Monte-Carlo {{computer}} simulations {{were used to}} investigate {{the relative importance of}} the partial dominance model and the <b>overdominance</b> model for the fitness and the probability of extinction of small populations. When 12 loci under partial dominance were combined with 4 loci under <b>overdominance,</b> the effects of partial dominance on the population fitness were on average undetectable within 25 generations for most values of the selection coefficients. When the fertility of the population was high, partial dominance on 12 out of 16 loci increased the probability of extinction only slightly in the first generations, whereas <b>overdominance</b> on 4 out of 16 loci increased the probability of extinction substantial in all generations. When the fertility was low, partial dominance increased the probability of extinction in the first generations much more than when the fertility was high, but the effects of partial dominance did not exceed the effects of <b>overdominance.</b> The probability of extinction was higher when the selection against partially dominant alleles was weak (s=O. 2), than when the selection was strong (s=l). It seemed that a long period of weak selection, wether caused by selection against partially dominant alleles or against overdominant alleles, was more harmful to small populations than a short period of rather strong selection. If <b>overdominance</b> is present on a few loci in a small population, its influence on population fitness and extinction probability may in many cases dominate the influence of partial dominance on many loci. ...|$|E
40|$|Associative <b>overdominance,</b> {{the fitness}} {{difference}} between heterozygotes and homozygotes at a neutral locus, is classically described using {{two categories of}} models: linkage disequilibrium in small populations or identity disequilibrium in infinite, partially selfing populations. In both cases, only equilibrium situations have been considered. In the present study, associative <b>overdominance</b> {{is related to the}} distribution of individual inbreeding levels (i. e., genomic autozygosity). Our model integrates the effects of physical linkage and variation in inbreeding history among individual pedigrees. Hence, linkage and identity disequilibrium, traditionally presented as alternatives, are summarized within a single framework. This allows studying nonequilibrium situations in which both occur simultaneously. The model is applied to the case of an infinite population undergoing a sustained population bottleneck. The effects of bottleneck size, mating system, marker gene diversity, deleterious genomic mutation parameters, and physical linkage are evaluated. Bottlenecks transiently generate much larger associative <b>overdominance</b> than observed in equilibrium finite populations and represent a plausible explanation of empirical results obtained, for instance, in marine species. Moreover, the main origin of associative <b>overdominance</b> is random variation in individual inbreeding whereas physical linkage has little effect...|$|E
40|$|Predictions for the {{evolution}} of mating systems and genetic load vary, depending on the genetic basis of inbreeding depression (dominance versus <b>overdominance,</b> epistasis and the relative frequencies of genes of large and small effect). A distinction between the dominance and <b>overdominance</b> hypotheses is that deleterious recessive mutations should be purged in inbreeding populations. Comparative studies of populations differing in their level of inbreeding and experimental approaches that allow selection among inbred lines support this prediction. More direct biometric approaches provide strong support for the importance of partly recessive deleterious alleles. Investigators using molecular markers to study quantitative trait loci (QTL) often find support for <b>overdominance,</b> though pseudo-overdominance (deleterious alleles linked in repulsion) may bias this perception. QTL and biometric studies of inbred lines often find evidence for epistasis, which may also contribute to the perception of <b>overdominance,</b> though this may be because of the divergent lines initially crossed in QTL studies. Studies of marker segregation distortion commonly uncover genes of major effect on viability, but these have only minor contributions to inbreeding depression. Although considerable {{progress has been made in}} understanding the genetic basis of inbreeding depression, we feel that all three aspects merit more study in natural plant populations...|$|E
40|$|Determination {{of genetic}} basis of {{heterosis}} may promote hybrid production in Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). This {{study was designed}} to explore the genetic mechanism of heterosis for yield and yield components in F 2 : 3 and F 2 : 4 populations derived from a hybrid 'Xinza No. 1 '. Replicated yield field trials of the progenies were conducted in 2008 and 2009. Phenotypic data analyses indicated <b>overdominance</b> in F 1 for yield and yield components. Additive and dominance effects at single-locus level and digenic epistatic interactions at two-locus level were analyzed by 421 marker loci spanning 3814 cM of the genome. A total of 38 and 49 QTLs controlling yield and yield components were identified in F 2 : 3 and F 2 : 4 populations, respectively. Analyses of these QTLs indicated that the effects of partial dominance and <b>overdominance</b> contributed to heterosis in Upland cotton simultaneously. Most of the QTLs showed partial dominance whereas 13 QTLs showing <b>overdominance</b> in F 2 : 3 population, and 19 QTLs showed <b>overdominance</b> in F 2 : 4. Among them, 21 QTLs were common in both F 2 : 3 and F 2 : 4 populations. A large number of two-locus interactions for yield and yield components were detected in both generations. AA (additive × additive) epistasis accounted for majority portion of epistatic effects. Thirty three complementary two-locus homozygotes (11 / 22 and 22 / 11) were the best genotypes for AA interactions in terms of bolls per plant. Genotypes of double homozygotes, 11 / 22, 22 / 11 and 22 / 22, performed best for AD/DA interactions, while genotype of 11 / 12 performed best for DD interactions. These results indicated that (1) partial dominance and <b>overdominance</b> effects at single-locus level and (2) epistasis at two-locus level elucidated the genetic basis of heterosis in Upland cotton...|$|E
40|$|Background: Doherty and Zinkernagel, who {{discovered}} that antigen presentation is restricted {{by the major}} histocompatibility complex (MHC, called HLA in humans), hypothesized that individuals heterozygous at particular MHC loci might be more resistant to particular infectious diseases than the corresponding homozygotes because heterozygotes could present a wider repertoire of antigens. The superiority of heterozygotes over either corresponding homozygote, which we term allele-specific <b>overdominance,</b> is of direct biological interest for understanding the mechanisms of immune response; {{it is also a}} leading explanation for the observation that MHC loci are extremely polymorphic and that these polymorphisms have been maintained through extremely long evolutionary periods. Recent studies have shown that in particular viral infections, heterozygosity at HLA loci was associated with a favorable disease outcome, and such findings have been interpreted as supporting the allele-specific <b>overdominance</b> hypothesis in humans. Methods and Results:We show that overrepresentation of HLA heterozygotes among individuals with favorable disease outcomes (which we term population heterozygote advantage) need not indicate allele-specific <b>overdominance.</b> On the contrary, partly due to a form of confounding by allele frequencies, population heterozygote advantage can occur under a very wide range of assumptions about the relationship between homozygote risk and heterozygote risk. In certain extreme cases, population heterozygote advantage can occur even when every heterozygote is at greater risk of being a case than either corresponding homozygote. Conclusions: To demonstrate allele-specific <b>overdominance</b> for specific infections in human populations, improved analytic tools and/or larger studies (or studies in populations with limited HLA diversity) are necessary. ...|$|E
