Then, when the used arm becomes tired, the swimmer turns on the other side, and the left arm works while the right arm rests.|$|E

This article looks at these motions that originate from unbalanced inertia forces and couples in the 2 steam engines and their coupled wheels (some similar motions {{may be caused by}} irregularities in the track running surface and stiffness). The first two motions are caused by the reciprocating masses and the last two by the <b>oblique</b> <b>action</b> of the con-rods, or piston thrust, on the guide bars.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The ground {{motion is}} multidimensional, random and {{uncertain}} in directions when earthquakes occur, so dynamic response under <b>oblique</b> seismic <b>action</b> {{needs to be}} considered in the structure design. A frame structure with different stiffness in two horizontal directions was analyzed under seismic action with different input angles. The maximum response of beams and columns was obtained. The seismic mechanism of structures under <b>oblique</b> seismic <b>action</b> was discussed...|$|R
50|$|DVD {{is often}} mistaken for over-action of the {{inferior}} oblique extra-ocular muscles. DVD can be revealed on ocular movement testing when one eye is occluded by the nose on lateral gaze. This eye will then elevate, simulating an inferior <b>oblique</b> over <b>action.</b> However, in a unilateral case, overaction {{of the superior}} rectus muscle in the unaffected dominant eye, {{can also be a}} causing factor as well as causing a V pattern exophoria.|$|R
50|$|The {{superior}} {{oblique muscle}} loops through a pulley-like structure (the trochlea of superior oblique) and inserts into the sclera on the posterotemporal surface of the eyeball. It is the pulley system that gives superior <b>oblique</b> its <b>actions,</b> causing depression of the eyeball despite being inserted on the superior surface.The superior oblique arises immediately above {{the margin of the}} optic foramen, superior and medial to the origin of the superior rectus, and, passing forward, ends in a rounded tendon, which plays in a fibrocartilaginous ring or pulley attached to the trochlear fossa of the frontal bone.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Infantile esotropia is an {{idiopathic}} esotropia previously {{called as}} congenital esotropia {{where there is}} an inward movement of one or both eyes. Up to 4 months of age, infrequent episodes of convergence are normal but thereafter ocular misalignment is abnormal. Congenital esotropia commonly referred as crossed eyes is not present since birth but usually develops within {{first six months of}} life in an otherwise normal infant with no significant refractive error and no limitation of ocular motility. Angle of deviation is usually constant and fairly large > 30 *. Infantile esotropia is usually associated with inferior <b>oblique</b> over <b>action</b> usually developing after one year of age, dissociated vertical deviation (DVD) in about 70 - 90...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: We {{wanted to}} {{examine the effect of}} graded {{recession}} and anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle on patients suffering from unilateral superior oblique palsy. Methods: Inferior oblique muscle graded recession and anteriorization were performed on twenty-two patients (22 eyes) with unilateral superior oblique palsy. The recession and anteriorization were matched to the degree of inferior oblique overaction and hypertropia. The inferior oblique muscle was attached 4 mm posterior to the temporal border of the inferior rectus muscle in six eyes, 3 mm posterior in five eyes, 2 mm posterior in five eyes, 1 mm posterior in five eyes, and parallel to the temporal border in one eye. Results: The average angle of vertical deviation prior to surgery was 11. 3 ± 3. 9 prism diopters (PD). The total average correction in the angle of vertical deviation after surgery was 10. 8 ± 3. 8 PD. In the parallel group, the average reduction was 14 PD. After surgery, normal inferior <b>oblique</b> muscle <b>action</b> was seen in eighteen of twenty-two eyes (81. 8 %). Conclusions: Graded recession and anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle is thought to be an effective surgical method to treat unilateral superior oblique palsy of less than 15 PD.

40|$|Introduction: Essential {{infantile}} esotropia is {{an entity}} in squint that requires particular attention {{because of its}} varied etiology and variable associated findings and that it {{most of the times}} requires early surgical intervention. Aims and Objectives: Our aim is to study incidence of occurrence, associated findings and binocular status of these patients. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study of 50 cases of Essential infantile esotropia who attended squint clinic of a tertiary referral center between September 2009 to September 2012 & were studied for their age of presentation, squint, cycloplegic refraction, binocular status and amblyopia. Results: Amongst 50 cases 46 % were male and 54 % were female patients. Most i. e. 62 % cases presented between 1 to 2 years of age. 76 % patients had unilateral deviation. Incidence of amblyopia was 76 %. 2 % cases had myopia, 90 % had mild to moderate hypermetropia, and 8 % cases had high hypermetropia. 52 % patients had inferior oblique over-action, 28 % had nystagmus, 8 % had head posture, 8 % had Dissociated Vertical Deviation. Stereopsis was not present in a single case. Conclusion: Our study assesses that the age of presentation is between 1 to 2 years. Amblyopia is commonly associated with unilateral deviation. Moderate hypermetropia is common. Inferior <b>oblique</b> over <b>action</b> is the most common association...|$|R
