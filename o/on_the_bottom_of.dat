5|$|Delayed by {{the change}} to the rules, McCool had a five-year stint from 1956 in English county cricket. Somerset, having {{finished}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the County Championship table for the four years between 1952–1955, had embarked on a renewal programme. Part of the programme involved a vigorous recruiting campaign, including an offer to McCool that saw him return to first-class cricket {{at the age of}} 39.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, an {{immigrant}} family acquired {{ownership of the}} theater. The Maizels family also owned other cinemas, including Aladdin Theater, the defunct and demolished Walnut Park, and the Encore, now known as Clinton Street Theater. In addition to Hollywood films, the cinemas screened art-house and Spanish-language movies. Multi-light Broadway Sign Co. installed corrugated aluminum <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the marquee in 1975.|$|E
5|$|In {{what turned}} out to be their final ever game, Cumberland were only able to field eleven out of the {{required}} thirteen players. The club ended up borrowing two players from the opposing team North Sydney to play for them, who were 'Paddy' Boland and Bert Odbert. They lost this game 45–0 and were awarded the wooden spoon for finishing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the competition ladder.|$|E

5|$|König was interned, {{along with}} the {{majority}} of the High Seas Fleet, in Scapa Flow in November 1918 following the Armistice. On 21 June 1919, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter gave the order to scuttle the fleet, including König, while the British guard ships were out of the harbor on exercises. Unlike most of the scuttled ships, König was never raised for scrapping; the wreck is still <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the bay.|$|E
5|$|Oil and gas form <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> shallow seas when {{micro-organisms}} decompose under anoxic {{conditions and}} later become covered with sediment.

5|$|After Germany's {{defeat in}} {{the war and the}} signing of the Armistice in November 1918, Kronprinz and most of the capital ships of the High Seas Fleet were interned by the Royal Navy in Scapa Flow. The ships were {{disarmed}} and reduced to skeleton crews while the Allied powers negotiated {{the final version of the}} Treaty of Versailles. On 21 June 1919, days before the treaty was signed, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the fleet to be scuttled to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the ships. Unlike most of the other scuttled ships, Kronprinz was never raised for scrapping; the wreck is still <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Anna has {{distinguishable}} {{facial features}} of a typical Disney heroine, including big eyes, thin lips and a small nose. Her physical appearance has drawn much comparison between her and Rapunzel from Tangled, however there are considerable differences between them. Anna's eyes are slightly more upturned, her cheeks are a bit fuller, her face and chin are generally rounder, and her eyebrows and eyelashes are thicker than Rapunzel's. She also has more freckles than Rapunzel and even has them on her shoulders. Anna's eyebrows wrinkle when they move, and she has prevalent neck muscles that appear when she speaks. Anna's travel outfit generally consists of magenta, black, dark and light blue, with flowery designs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> her dress.|$|E

5|$|Brummer and Bremse {{typically}} operated together {{throughout the}} war. They participated in numerous minelaying operations in 1916 and 1917. The two cruisers devastated a British convoy to Norway in October 1917, sinking the two escorting destroyers {{and most of}} the transports. Both were interned at Scapa Flow {{at the end of the}} war; they were successfully scuttled in June 1919. Brummer remains <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the harbor, but Bremse was raised for scrapping in 1929 and broken up in the early 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Cöln and Dresden {{joined the}} High Seas Fleet in 1918, which limited their service careers. They were {{assigned}} to the II Scouting Group, and participated in an abortive fleet operation to Norway to attack British convoys. They were to have led attacks on British merchant traffic designed to lure out the British Grand Fleet and force a climactic fleet battle {{in the final days of}} the war, but the Wilhelmshaven Mutiny forced the cancellation of the plan. The two ships were interned and eventually scuttled in Scapa Flow in June 1919. Both Dresden and Cöln remain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> Scapa Flow.|$|E
5|$|In September 1909, {{three of}} the ships, Liberté, Justice, and Vérité visited the United States for the Hudson-Fulton Celebration. Two years later, Libertés forward {{magazines}} exploded in Toulon harbor, destroying the ship and killing approximately 250 of her crew. The three surviving ships saw action early in World War I at the Battle of Antivari, and spent the remainder blockading the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the Adriatic and were later stationed at Mudros in the Aegean. They were stricken from the naval register in 19211922 and broken up for scrap. Liberté was left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> Toulon harbor until 1925, when she was raised and broken up for scrap.|$|E
30|$|Since {{bacteria}} form biofilms <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> {{and sides}} <b>of</b> plates, confocal laser microscopy {{was used to}} observe biofilm formation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> 96 -well polystyrene plates. In-line with our quantitative data, 5 -iodoindole at 0.2  mM (1 / 10 of MIC) dramatically inhibited biofilm formation by E. coli and S. aureus (Fig.  4 d, e). Also, relative amounts of biofilm formation by E. coli and S. aureus confirmed that S. aureus 6538 produced markedly more biofilm than E. coli BW 25113 under the same conditions.|$|R

5|$|In Shin Megami Tensei II, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} the gladiator Hawk, who is able to {{communicate}} with demons. The gameplay {{is similar to that of}} the first Shin Megami Tensei: the game is controlled from a first-person view, and has the player exploring dungeons and navigating outdoor areas, which are presented as 2D maps seen from a top-down perspective. In both these types of areas, the player encounters and battles against demons; a gauge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the screen shows the likelihood of a demon encounter.|$|E

Johnson, Robbie, and Gabe hide from Mace in a special containment module <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the Zephyr, and Robbie explains the truth to Gabe: the night he was paralyzed, Robbie was killed in the car crash, and was resurrected when a Ghost Rider passed on the Spirit of Vengeance to him.|$|E
5|$|Kosygin {{worked for}} the State Defence Committee during the Great Patriotic War (World War II). As Deputy Chairman of the Council of Evacuation, his task was to {{evacuate}} industry from territories soon to be overrun by the Germans. He broke the Leningrad Blockade by organising {{the construction of a}} supply route and a pipeline <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> Lake Ladoga. Kosygin was a candidate member of the Politburo from 1946 to 1949, and became a full member toward the end of Joseph Stalin's rule; he lost his seat in 1952. He briefly served as Minister of Finance in 1948, and as Minister of Light Industry from 1949 to 1953.|$|E

40|$|The {{material}} and electrical {{properties of the}} CNT single vias and array vias grown by microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition were investigated. The diameters of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) grown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> electrode <b>of</b> Ta decrease with increasing pretreatment power and substrate temperature while {{the effects of the}} growth power and methane flow ratio are insignificant The decrease of CNT diameters leads to the decrease of the CNT via diode devices. The increase of growth power enhances the CNT graphitization degree and thue the conductivity of CNT via diode devices. In the same via region, the MWNT diode resistances of the array vias are lower than those of the single vias. The MWNT diode resistances <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> electrode <b>of</b> titanium are lower than those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> electrode <b>of</b> tantalum. It may be attributed to the smaller tube diameters <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> electrode <b>of</b> Ti and the work function difference between Ta and Ti films with respect to the work function of CNTs...|$|R
