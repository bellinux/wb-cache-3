5|$|Immediately {{following}} the funeral, a cortege of approximately 500 mourners accompanied Sarria's body to Woodlawn Memorial Park in Colma, {{where he was}} buried with full military honors in a plot he had previously purchased at the foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> of Joshua Norton.|$|E

5|$|While Colbung {{was in the}} United Kingdom, Martin and Richard Bates {{were engaged}} to {{undertake}} a geophysical survey <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> site. Using electromagnetic and ground penetrating radar techniques, they identified an approximate position of the box that suggested it could be accessed from the side via the adjacent plot. A report of the survey was passed to the Home Office, prompting further discussions between the British and Australian Governments.|$|E

5|$|Forensic archaeologists {{can help}} {{determine}} potential grave sites {{that might have}} been overlooked. Differences in the soil can help forensic archaeologists locate these sites. During the burial of a body, a small mound of soil will form from the filling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave.</b> The loose soil and increasing nutrients from the decomposing body encourages different kinds of plant growth than surrounding areas. Typically, grave sites will have looser, darker, more organic soil than areas around it. The search for additional grave sites can be useful during the investigation of genocide and mass graves to search for additional burial locations.|$|E
5|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} for Hasidic Jews to place kvitelach on the gravesite of a Rebbe or tzadik {{with the belief that}} the soul of the deceased will pray for them in Heaven. The visitor usually sits beside the grave to write his kvitel and meditate on his request, and then tears the kvitel and throws it on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave.</b> Many graves of Jewish holy men are constructed with special apertures for the insertion of kvitelach.|$|E
5|$|The {{exhumation}} of Yagan's head eventually proceeded, without Colbung's knowledge, by excavating {{six feet}} {{down the side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave,</b> then tunnelling horizontally {{to the location of}} the box. Thus the exhumation was performed without disturbing any other remains. The following day, a forensic palaeontologist from the University of Bradford positively identified the skull as Yagan's by correlating the fractures with those described in Pettigrew's report. The skull was then kept at the museum until 29 August, when it was handed over to the Liverpool City Council.|$|E
50|$|Bulqan Necropolis - {{the archaeological}} {{monument}} in the Nakhchivan city, near the same named village. Here were found several <b>grave</b> monuments. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>graves</b> are sunken, {{in its place}} were left the square holes. <b>The</b> head parts <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>graves</b> was broken. <b>The</b> upper part <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gravestones were completed in the crown form. It is assumed that the findings belongs to the 12-19 centuries.|$|R

5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who do not want to see, and they expect a miracle from the Führer. Those are {{the kind of people who}} do not give up hope even at the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave.</b> In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to understand why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something should be said to clear up the question.|$|E
5|$|As reports <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> {{registration}} work became public, the Commission {{began to}} receive letters of enquiry {{and requests for}} photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers. By 1917, 17,000 photographs had been dispatched to relatives. In March 1915, the Commission, {{with the support of}} the Red Cross, began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information in answer to the requests. The Graves Registration Commission became the Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries in the spring of 1916 in recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding to enquiries from relatives of those killed. The directorate's work was also extended beyond the Western Front and into other theatres of war, with units deployed in Greece, Egypt and Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|Burial 23 was a royal tomb {{inserted}} {{by destroying}} the second {{version of the}} access stairway of Temple 33. The individual interred within the tomb has not been identified but the tomb {{is one of two}} proposed locations for the burial of the late 7th-century king Nuun Ujol Chaak. The tomb was cut into the bedrock under the temple, to the south of the burial of Siyaj Chan K'awiil II. The king appears to have been hastily interred in a tomb that was still being prepared while the burial took place, since plaster from the walls was splashed on some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> goods and a flint pick was accidentally left behind by a workman. The body of the king was laid upon a litter painted with cinnabar and overlain with jaguar-pelts; the corpse was laid out on the pelts and covered in layers of marine shells.|$|E

5|$|It {{begins with}} a young girl playing in the {{backyard}} as snow falls on the ground. The scene shifts {{to that of a}} bedside, where a young woman who has died, lies. Her husband covers her with a white sheet as a priest prays. Madonna, wearing a long, black coat, sings the song underneath a snow-covered, dead tree, as the young girl plays with her dead mother's jewelry. The husband comes and shouts at the girl, tearing away the woman's pearl necklace which drop at the little girl's feet. The adult Madonna is shown lying beside another man singing the song as the little girl visits her mother's grave. The man gets up and slaps Madonna in the face, as the little girl cries in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave.</b> She is taken away from the graveyard by her father, as interspersed scenes show the girl being kissed by her mother, her trying to reach the knob of a door, and Madonna powdering the bruise mark on her face.|$|E
5|$|During the Song period, {{there was}} a great deal of {{organized}} labor and bureaucracy involved in the extraction of resources from the various provinces in China. The production of sulfur, which the Chinese called 'vitriol liquid', was extracted from pyrite and used for pharmaceutical purposes as well as for the creation of gunpowder. This was done by roasting iron pyrites, converting the sulphide to oxide, as the ore was piled up with coal briquettes in an earthenware furnace with a type of still-head to send the sulfur over as vapour, after which it would solidify and crystallize. The historical text of the Song Shi (History of the Song, compiled in 1345 AD) stated that the major producer of sulfur in the Tang and Song dynasties was the Jin Zhou sub-provincial administrative region (modern Linfen in southern Shanxi). The bureaucrats appointed to the region managed the industrial processing and sale of it, and the amount created and distributed from the years 996 to 997 alone was 405,000 jin (roughly 200 tons). It was recorded that in 1076 AD the Song government held a strict commercial monopoly on sulfur production, and if dye houses and government workshops sold their products to private dealers in the black market, they were subject to meted penalties by government authorities. Even before this point, in 1067 AD, the Song government had issued an edict that the people living in Shanxi and Hebei were forbidden to sell foreigners any products containing saltpetre and sulfur. This act by the Song government displayed their fears <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> potential of gunpowder weapons being developed by Song China's territorial enemies as well (i.e. the Tanguts and Khitans).|$|E
5|$|In late 1558, Calvin {{became ill}} with a fever. Since {{he was afraid}} that he might die before {{completing}} the final revision of the Institutes, he forced himself to work. The final edition was greatly expanded to the extent that Calvin referred to it as a new work. The expansion from the 21 chapters of the previous edition to 80 was due to the extended treatment of existing material rather than the addition of new topics. Shortly after he recovered, he strained his voice while preaching, which brought on a violent fit of coughing. He burst a blood-vessel in his lungs, and his health steadily declined. He preached his final sermon in St. Pierre on 6February 1564. On 25April, he made his will, in which he left small sums to his family and to the collège. A few days later, the ministers of the church came to visit him, and he bade his final farewell, which was recorded in Discours d'adieu aux ministres. He recounted his life in Geneva, sometimes recalling bitterly some of the hardships he had suffered. Calvin died on 27May 1564 aged 54. At first his body lay in state, but since so many people came to see it, the reformers were afraid that they would be accused of fostering a new saint's cult. On the following day, he was buried in an unmarked grave in the Cimetière des Rois. The exact location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> is unknown; a stone was added in the 19th century to mark a grave traditionally thought to be Calvin's.|$|E

5|$|Still, Finley & Figg {{remains in}} bad shape. The Krayoxx affair has left them deep in debt {{instead of the}} {{expected}} big profit, their office building – the firm's sole asset – heavily mortgaged and the two partners ailing, in bad shape physically and mentally. Meanwhile, David manages to complete his lead poisoning product liability case, finding that the destructive toys were imported from China by a subsidiary of Sonesta Games, the third-largest toy producer in the U.S. Unlike the Krayoxx case, this provides David with an air-tight case. A jury seeing the poor child, completely disabled as a direct provable result of using the toy, would be certain to grant a high sum in compensations. Knowing this, the Sonesta CEO and his senior executives hasten to meet with David, seeming to show genuine remorse, aside from being aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> damage which the publicity around such a case could cause their corporation. They readily agree to give David's clients, the child's Burmese immigrant parents $5 million in out-of-court compensation, provided that the case remain secret. David insists, however, that $1.5 million in legal fees would not {{come out of his}} clients' compensation but be paid separately by Sonesta; knowing himself to have the upper hand, Zinc is a tough negotiator and the Sonesta directors {{have no choice but to}} agree to pay a total of $6.5 million. In parting, a Sonesta executive discreetly slips Zinc an unmarked envelope with information on lead poisoning caused by the products of Sonesta's competitors.|$|E
