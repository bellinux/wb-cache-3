He met Jimmy Rawnsley at this time, a 32-year-old electrical engineer who would later serve as aerial gunner and radar operator on all but three of John's successful air battles. Cunningham subsequently became a junior test pilot with de Havilland, working with light aircraft alongside Geoffrey de Havilland, the company founder's son and chief test pilot. The company was short <b>of</b> <b>test</b> pilots and Cunningham caught the eye of de Havilland as his flight experience grew. It was reflected by his promotion to flying officer on 5 December 1937. At this time John began to care more for test-flying than manufacture and design. He became one of four of de Havilland's top test pilots.|$|E

Thus psychologists should specify which test was given when reporting a test-taker's IQ. Psychologists and IQ test authors recommend that psychologists adopt the terminology of each test publisher when reporting IQ score ranges.|$|E

40|$|In the {{research}} on automatic generation <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> cases, there are different execution paths under drivers <b>of</b> different <b>testing</b> cases. The probability of these paths being executed is also different. For paths which are easy to be executed, more redundant testing case tend to be generated; But only fewer testing cases are generated for the control paths which are hard to be executed. Genetic algorithm {{can be used to}} instruct the automatic generation <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> cases. For the former paths, it can restrict the generation of these kinds <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> cases. On the contrary, the algorithm will encourage the generation <b>of</b> such <b>testing</b> cases as much as possible. So based on the study on the technology <b>of</b> path-oriented <b>testing</b> case automatic generation, the genetic algorithm is adopted to construct the process of automatic generation. According to the triggering path during the dynamic execution of program, the generated testing cases are separated into different equivalence class. The number <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> case is adjusted dynamicly by the fitness corresponding to the paths. The method can create a certain number <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> cases for each execution path to ensure the sufficiency. It also reduces redundant testing cases so it is an effective method for automatic generation <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> cases...|$|R
