Traditionally, <b>overspeed</b> <b>protection</b> systems were designed and provided by the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) - few options were available either in terms of testing or modifying these systems.

Finally, {{the current status of}} aileron-control development is discussed.

40|$|Nuclear reactor plants {{include a}} turbine {{generator}} system (TGS) {{to convert the}} energy in steam from the {{nuclear steam supply system}} into electrical energy. The TGS consists essentially of the turbine unit and the automatic devices, alarms, and trips which control and regulate turbine action, and the generator unit and its Con-trols. The turbine control system and the steam inlet stop and control valves, the low pressure turbine steam intercept and inlet control valves, and the extraction steam control valves control the speed of the turbine under normal and abnormal conditions, and are thus related to the overall safe operation of the plant. The turbine generator system installed in a nuclear plant is typically equipped with redundant <b>overspeed</b> <b>protection</b> instrumentation and controls and the main steam and reheat steam control and stop valving arrangements typically provide redundancy in the valves essential for <b>overspeed</b> <b>protection.</b> The intent of the review under this SRP section is to verify that such redundancy, in conjunction with inservice inspection and testing of the essential valves, makes a turbine overspeed condition above the design overspeed very unlikely and to assure conformance with General Design Criterion 4.

40|$|Purpose: Since we {{reported}} about a landmark technique to reopen an occluded subclavian artery, we have faced difficulty in using <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> in the vertebral artery {{to protect against}} thromboembolism from the reversed steal phenomenon after angioplasty and stenting. Therefore, we are presenting an optimal solution in using a <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> while recanalizing the occluded subclavian artery. Materials and Methods: Among 21 cases of stenting for subclavian artery steno-occlusion, we applied the landmark technique {{at the opposite end}} of an occluded segment in 4 patients and used a <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> in two patients. Because the embolic <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> was placed in the vertebral artery via the brachial artery, optimal angioplasty and stenting via the brachial route were limited. Therefore, angioplasty via the trans-brachial approach was needed to be followed by stenting through a trans-femoral approach.

Results: The procedure was safely performed when a stent was introduced via the femoral artery and a <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> was used via the brachial artery.

We report here on our early experiences with balloon occlusion and filter type distal <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> that were used for CAS. Subjects and Methods：CAS was performed on 92 lesions of 73 patients (age： 61. 0 ± 12. 7 years, males： 71. 2 %). Of these patients, 16 patients with 17 carotid lesions underwent CAS using distal <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> A balloon occlusion type <b>protection</b> <b>device,</b> PercuSurge GuardWire system, was used for 8 lesions and a filter type, FilterWire EX system, was used for 9 lesions.

Stenting using <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> is the most accepted endovascular technique. Our aim is to show the safety and efficacy of carotid stenting without any <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> in these patients. Material and methods All patients older than 75 years with carotid stenosis treated in our center between January 2002 and December 2012 were included in this prospective study. All were treated by carotid stenting without <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> Angiographic results, neurologic complications and Doppler ultrasound were collected during the procedure and within 30 days. Results 49 patients were included (mean age 78. 2 years, range 75 – 86). The average degree of stenosis was 88. 2 %. During the procedure there were two cases of transient ischemic attack and one intraparenchymal hemorrhage. At 30 days there was a non-disabling stroke. The combined rate of disabling stroke plus myocardial infarction plus death was 6 % at 30 days and the rate of any stroke was 4 % during the procedure and 2 % at 30 days.
