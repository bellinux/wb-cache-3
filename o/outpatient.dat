40|$|This study scrutinizes {{the ability}} of the WHO quality of life {{assessment}} instrument (WHOQOL- 100) to discriminate (1) between psychiatric <b>outpatients</b> and the general population, and (2) between subgroups of psychiatric <b>outpatients.</b> A sample of Dutch adult psychiatric <b>outpatients</b> (N= 410) completed the WHOQOL- 100. In addition, DSM-IV Axis-I and Axis-II diagnoses were obtained. Compared with the general population, psychiatric <b>outpatients</b> scored significantly lower on all aspects of self-reported quality of life (QOL). Within the group of <b>outpatients,</b> participants with DSM-IV diagnoses had lower scores than those without. Participants with diagnoses on both Axis-I and Axis-II of DSM-IV (comorbidity) had the lowest self-reported QOL.

Therefore, {{the feasibility of}} using mobile phones to improve the adherence of <b>outpatients</b> was assessed among <b>outpatients</b> scheduled for SGIE. Methods: The study {{was designed as a}} cross-sectional study using survey questionnaires. <b>Outpatients</b> who would be undergoing SGIE were enrolled. The main outcomes included proportions of <b>outpatients</b> who have access to mobile phones, and the use of text-messaging among <b>outpatients.</b> Willingness to receive text messages and personal opinions about short message service (SMS) were also investigated. Characteristics of <b>outpatients,</b> including socio-demographic factors, with a mobile phone (or those who could receive and read messages) compared with those without a mobile phone (or those who could not receive and read messages) were compared using the chi-square test. Logistic regression was used to analyze significant contributing factors associated with mobile phone ownership and the use of text messages. Results: A large majority of <b>outpatients</b> owned personal mobile phones (94. 9 %) and could receive and read the messages (78. 9 %). Most of the <b>outpatients</b> were willing to receive a pre-procedure education via text message (81. 9 %). <b>Outpatients</b> aged 16 – 39 years old and those with a college education or higher were more likely to use mobile phones and read SMS than <b>outpatients</b> aged 60 – 80 years old and those with only a primary education level (P< 0. 0001). <b>Outpatients</b> who lived in an urban setting were more likely to own a mobile phone than <b>outpatients</b> who lived in a rural setting (P= 0. 002). Conclusion: The accessibility of mobile phones and the frequent use of message functions on mobile phones provide support for the initiation of an SMS reminder system for <b>outpatients</b> who will undergo SGIE in the People’s Republic of China. In addition, the characteristics of the target study population should be considered when carrying out an SMS intervention.
