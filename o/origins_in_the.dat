5|$|The Selle Français is {{generally}} bay or chestnut in color, {{the latter being}} a legacy of its <b>origins</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-Norman breed. Gray is much less common, with its <b>origins</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Thoroughbred and Anglo-Arabian horses {{that contributed to the}} breed. White markings, such as white on the lower legs, are fairly common within the breed, and are again inherited from its Norman ancestors. The temperament of the Selle Français is highly variable from one horse to another. This is due to the selection criteria for breeding stock, which {{since the beginning of the}} breed have been based on physical ability. In recent years, however, the ANSF and breeders have been working to create selection criteria that focus on temperament. The vast majority of Selle Français have good temperaments, quiet but energetic, patient and friendly. The breed is reputed to be intelligent and quick to learn.|$|E
