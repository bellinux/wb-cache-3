5|$|Some {{species of}} thrips create galls, almost always in leaf tissue. These may occur as curls, rolls or folds, or as {{alterations}} {{to the expansion}} of tissues causing distortion to leaf blades. More complex examples cause rosettes, pouches and horns. Most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>species</b> occur in the tropics and sub-tropics, and the structures of the galls are diagnostic of the species involved. A radiation of thrips species seems to have taken place on Acacia trees in Australia; some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>species</b> cause galls in the petioles, sometimes fixing two leaf stalks together, while other species live in every available crevice in the bark. In Casuarina in the same country, some species have invaded stems, creating long-lasting woody galls.|$|E
5|$|The bulbous base, large spores, and {{distinctive}} habitat are characteristic features {{that make this}} species readily distinguishable from other boletes. It has a coloration and cap texture similar to Boletus flaviporus and B.auriporus, but the spores <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>species</b> are shorter (11–15µm and 11–16µm, respectively).|$|E

5|$|Animals {{living on}} the volcano include the {{mountain}} tapir and spectacled bear, {{both of which are}} designated as threatened. Other animals inhabiting the surrounding region include the rufous-fronted parakeet, bearded helmetcrest, and Herveo plump toad. The volcano is home to 27 species of birds endemic to Colombia, with 14 <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>species</b> confined to the region around the volcano. 15 bird species in the area are considered threatened.|$|E
5|$|Aside from carp, {{several species}} of fish and {{amphibians}} still inhabited the creek up to the 1980s, when floods destroyed much of the remaining riparian habitat. These included the mosquito fish, bluegill, bass, and channel catfish, as well as {{several species of}} native frogs. After the floods, most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>species</b> were reported to have disappeared completely.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{this ability}} to digest food outside the body, starfish can hunt prey much larger than their mouths. Their diets include clams and oysters, arthropods, small fish and {{gastropod}} molluscs. Some starfish are not pure carnivores, supplementing their diets with algae or organic detritus. Some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>species</b> are grazers, but others trap food particles from the water in sticky mucus strands that are swept towards the mouth along ciliated grooves.|$|E
5|$|In precocial species, {{the mothers}} invest little in nest {{building}} {{and some do}} not build nests at all. The female gives birth standing and the young emerge behind her. Mothers <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>species</b> maintain contact with their highly mobile young with maternal contact calls. Though relatively independent and weaned within days, precocial young may continue to nurse and be groomed by their mothers. Rodent litter sizes also vary and females with smaller litters {{spend more time in}} the nest than those with larger litters.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of DNA sequences suggests that V.surrecta {{belongs to the}} Volvariella pusilla group—a grouping of related Volvariella species that produce small, white fruit bodies. In this analysis, V.surrecta formed a subclade with V.hypopithys. Almost 90 years earlier, Paul Konrad and André Maublanc recognized the relatedness <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>species,</b> and proposed that V.surrecta {{should be considered a}} subspecies of V.hypopithys.|$|E

Brachyhypopomus bombilla, B. draco and B. gauderio can be sympatric and syntopic in Pre-Delta National Park, whereas B. bombilla and B. gauderio occupy the same environments in the Iberá Wetlands.

5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of {{internal transcribed spacer}} DNA sequences shows that C.vinicolor groups in a clade with the closely related C.jamaicensis and C.pseudovinicolor. All <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>species</b> feature darkly-amyloid flesh and thick-walled cystidia. Based on this analysis, Miller considered C.jamaicensis to be insufficiently distinct genetically from C.vinicolor to warrant designation as a separate species; however, as of 2012, both MycoBank and Index Fungorum list it as a valid species.|$|E
5|$|More {{fish have}} been {{discovered}} in the newly daylighted section of the river. Baby eastern blacknose dace and tessellated darter have been spotted in the river in addition to trout. In addition, wood frogs, eastern painted turtles, and redbreast sunfish live in the river too. All <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>species</b> have been hurt by the industrialization of the river.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{evidence}} for common descent {{has come from}} the study of biochemical similarities between organisms. For example, all living cells use the same basic set of nucleotides and amino acids. The development of molecular genetics has revealed the record of evolution left in organisms' genomes: dating when species diverged through the molecular clock produced by mutations. For example, these DNA sequence comparisons have revealed that humans and chimpanzees share 98% of their genomes and analysing the few areas where they differ helps shed light on when the common ancestor <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>species</b> existed.|$|E

5|$|Other seals, {{like the}} walrus and most phocids, breed on ice with {{copulation}} usually {{taking place in}} the water (a few land-breeding species also mate in water). Females <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>species</b> tend to aggregate less. In addition, since ice is less stable than solid land, breeding sites change location each year, and males are unable to predict where females will stay during the breeding season. Hence polygyny tends to be weaker in ice-breeding species. An exception to this is the walrus, where females form dense aggregations perhaps due to their patchy food sources. Pinnipeds that breed on fast ice tend to cluster together more than those that breed on pack ice. Some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>species</b> are serially monogamous, including the harp seal, crabeater seal and hooded seal. Seals that breed on ice tend to have little or no sexual dimorphism. In lobodontine seals, females are slightly longer than males. Walruses and hooded seals are unique among ice-breeding species in that they have pronounced sexual dimorphism in favor of males.|$|E
5|$|Puerto Rico's turtle fauna {{includes}} both freshwater (5 species, including two extinct species) and marine turtles (5). Two <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>species,</b> the hawksbill turtle and the leatherback sea turtle, are critically endangered.

5|$|Radiolaria {{have left}} a {{geological}} record {{since at least the}} Ordovician times, and their mineral fossil skeletons can be tracked across the K–Pg boundary. There is no evidence of mass extinction of these organisms, and there is support for high productivity <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>species</b> in southern high latitudes as a result of cooling temperatures in the early Paleocene. Approximately 46% of diatom species survived the transition from the Cretaceous to the Upper Paleocene. This suggests a significant turnover in species, but not a catastrophic extinction of diatoms, across the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
