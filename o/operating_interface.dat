This paper proposes an agent-based device management approach in RFID middleware. We design two types of agents: Control Agent and Device Agent. Control Agent manages and maintains the life cycle of each Device Agent, and coordinates the work of multiple Device Agents. Device Agent lies between the RFID middleware and the physical device. It provides a common <b>operating</b> <b>interface</b> for RFID middleware, implements remote configuration and grouping management for RFID devices, monitors the real-time state of RFID devices, deals with unexpected events, and carries out fault-tolerant processing when necessary. Through the collaboration of multiple Device Agents, we can dynamically schedule jobs for different devices to optimize the allocation of system resources. Applying agent technology in device management reduces the coupling between RFID middleware and physical devices, therefore, increases the flexibility and scalability of RFID system...|$|E

30|$|It can be {{seen from}} the {{experiment}} data that during the first week, the user needs to look at the audio interface in order to operate it. However, starting from the second week, the user can reduce the time spent on the monitor based on the memories of previous operations. Our method allows the user to select music files using 2 D images. The user can rapidly complete the operation by touching specific locations on the touch panel. In contrast, for a conventional <b>operating</b> <b>interface,</b> the user would need to spend an extended period of time interacting with the monitor in order locate a specific song from a long list of the file names, since each genre category contains a large number of songs. Observation of the results from the two experiments described above demonstrates that our proposed method requires the least operation time and requires the least time for the user to look at the monitor. The reduced time allows the driver to concentrate on the road while driving, which reduces the risk of an accident.|$|E
30|$|In {{the virtual}} {{simulation}} world, time is advanced in a non-continuous way, and the advanced interval precision determines the required reality time. For saving reality time, {{we focus on}} the occurrence time of the specific event, called monitor time.

The processing procedures of all event types define a common execution interface, which consist of many sub-procedures, while the <b>operating</b> <b>interface</b> of these sub-procedures is defined in the event processing procedure package. The different types of devices may have the same type of events, but their processing procedure may be different; therefore, the execution details and steps of the sub-procedures are provided by the device class, i.e., the concept that “the event owner certainly has the ability to handle event.” We establish a chain of event types to accomplish a specific purpose to facilitate the management of the relationship among events and to mitigate the management problem caused by increasing the number of sub-procedures because the system quickly grows up, where the codes are independently in various sub-packages, that is how we implement the command flow way.|$|E

30|$|Scheduler {{package is}} a program {{collection}} {{which is responsible for}} scheduling mechanism corresponding to the real world, whose main capability is the implementation of scheduler algorithm, and the goal is to make the reuse of system scheduler codes to maximize. In order to let all scheduling algorithms share a common <b>operating</b> <b>interface,</b> to combine multiple parameters into a schedule metric to implement the more complex schedule concept, and to replace the schedule module more easily to evaluate the performance of various scheduling algorithms, we propose four design concepts; the first is the input of schedule module which is scheduling units having the ability to generate the schedule comparison unit; the second is schedule comparison unit having the abilities to compare with identical class and combine many parameters to form a comparison item; the third is the core of schedule module which is scheduling algorithm concentrating on the schedule mechanism; the fourth is the output of schedule module which is an ordered set of scheduling units. In the aspect of pattern use, we use a strategy pattern to encapsulate the schedule module to make them interchangeable, and the system architecture and the exchange of schedule algorithms are independent. The factory pattern simplifies the generate procedure of schedule unit. In this package, we implement uniform, random, and round robin scheduling algorithm to demonstrate the feasibility. The UML diagram for scheduler package is shown in Appendix  1 : Fig. 14.|$|E

40|$|Drop foot is {{a problem}} that can affect people following, for example, a stroke or onset of {{multiple}} sclerosis. In some individuals, it can be corrected by means of electrical stimulation of the peroneal nerve using surface (skin) electrodes. However, placing the electrodes in the right position is often described by patients as a time consuming and tedious task. Implantable solutions have been developed to address this problem, although {{the current state of the}} art indicates that surface stimulation is more suitable for patients with non-stable neurological conditions. Consequently, a number of researchers have developed approaches based on surface electrode arrays, yet problems delaying their clinical acceptance still remain. The key objective of this research was the exploration and implementation of novel solutions for surface arrays. This led to the design and fabrication of an open-loop array based system and its evaluation with healthy volunteers and individuals (patients) presenting with drop foot. Finite element based software was first used as a tool for modelling the current density distribution throughout the stimulated tissue using two preliminary array-gel combinations. The modelling results suggested that one of the configurations would produce greater selectivity and uniform patterns of current density distribution. Subsequently, both arrays were fabricated and their electrical performance tested against a commercial surface electrode of similar dimensions. The results showed that the arrays gave similar trends to those produced by the conventional one, and confirmed the selection of the array-gel combination for further testing with volunteers. This array was fabricated on a flexible printed circuit board, and then embedded in a self adjustable bandage. Microcontroller based hardware and software was developed to drive the array. This allowed creation and fine steering of virtual electrodes (VEs), as well as data visualisation and recording using a remote PC. In addition, it provided the patient with an <b>operating</b> <b>interface</b> together with an audiovisual environment to guide the task of electrode positioning. The array prototype was first evaluated with a group of 12 healthy volunteers while seated. Angular information from the ankle and foot were recorded using a twin-axis flexible goniometer placed on the lower leg. The data was used to chart the electrically induced angular motion obtained at each VE position throughout the array. The charts revealed that adequate (functional) responses were obtained by all the participants for one or more VE position and size, but that the distribution of these on the array varied between subjects. The intra-subject repeatability of the responses to stimulation during two different sessions was also assessed. The results showed that although the distribution of functional responses in the array was not highly repeatable, some of the VEs overlapped suggesting the likelihood of reappearance in future sessions. This suggests the feasibility of defining templates of functional sub-regions of the array to streamline the positioning process. The final stage of the project was a preliminary evaluation of the system with a group of 5 patients who are current users of stimulators to correct drop foot. The objective was to obtain preliminary feedback from them on the use of the array <b>operating</b> <b>interface</b> to find functional responses for various sizes of VEs while seated. A questionnaire was designed for this purpose and the data revealed that most of the patients not only found the right position for at least one of the VEs in an easy manner, but also found the stimulation to be similar or more comfortable than that experienced when using their conventional system. In summary, the results from these pilot studies with healthy and impaired volunteers demonstrated that it is feasible and relatively easy to find functional responses when using the system. Future work will be focused on the development of a self-contained portable stimulator/array sleeve that can be worn on the shank. However, additional studies involving a larger number of patients, a validated questionnaire, and the assessment of the response during walking would be necessary prior to clinical use of the system...|$|E
40|$|Java 3 D is an {{addition}} to Java for displaying three-dimensional graphics. Programs written in Java 3 D can be run on several different types of computer and over the internet. Using 3 D maps on mobile devices is a main challenge in Location Based Services (LBS). The 3 D-maps will automatically created from the database using special queries for map generation. The 3 D-map itself should be rendered at the server based on user position and line of sight. The mobile device will only receive an image that can be rendered using available technology. In this thesis, a query interface for server-side rendering of 3 D-maps and visibility queries have been specified and implemented for a project named "GEIST". In addition, a client application has been developed {{in order to test}} the interface. GEIST project serves as an example to teach students and adults about the history of a specific place by offering a personalized, lively tour without a guide. Individuals can walk around an area, and as they approach the location of a scene in a story consisting of historical facts and fictional elements, the tour is continued. Server-side programming is today's way of choice to develop web applications. It will be used to provide a real-world application for the GEIST project here. The main technologies used in the thesis, such as structure of a scene graph, off-screen rendering, web application, are introduced. After that, the real work of the development is described step by step. Firstly a way to construct three-dimensional graphics is introduced. Structure diagram is used to explain the relationships between objects in a scene graph. Objects in a scene graph can be handled. Different surfaces of the objects can be viewed when they are rotated. Color of the objects can be specified. Further more, through counting and comparing the pixels of different color, a visibility analysis can be done for the objects in the future. A scene graphs can be shown into a Canvas 3 D by running the java program. The Canvas 3 D can be rendered into an image with jpeg format through off-screen rendering. People can view the final result about an edited scene graph with a jpeg image. A real-world application for the GEIST project is done with Oracle 9 i Application Server(Oracle 9 i AS). The default paths for storing files in Oracle 9 i AS are used here. A web page is prepared as an entrance for the client to input the values and get results. Servlets used in building interactive web application. At the end of the thesis, it's the outlook for the GEIST project and techniques development.

Terpene werden von Pflanzen zur Abwehr oder zur rnAttraktion von Bestäubern emittiert. Ungesättigten Verbindungen, wie Sesquiterpene, rnsind sehr ozonolyseempfindlich und weisen nur geringe Konzentrationen in der rnAtmosphäre auf. Zudem lassen sie sich mit handelsüblichen rnThermodesorptionseinheiten meist nicht ohne Artefakte nachweisen, da sie eine hohe rnReaktivität mit vielen Oberflächen zeigen. rnDiese Arbeit präsentiert Forschungsergebnisse der qualitativen und rn(semi) quantitativen Auswertungen flüchtiger organischer Verbindungen in rnLaborstudien und biogenen Emissionsproben (Feldmessungen) mittels rnThermodesorption-Gaschromatographie-Massenspektrometrie (TD-GC/MS). Speziell rnzur Analyse hochreaktiver Verbindungen wurde eine Thermodesorptionseinheit für die rnGC/MS entwickelt. Diese besteht aus einer Kryofokussierung, einem Desorptionsofen rnund einer Heizung. Die Steuerung erfolgt über eine eigens dafür geschaffene rnBedienoberf läche von Labview® an einem PC über eine nachgeschaltete SPS rn(speicherprogrammierbare Steuerung). Das komplette Desorptionsprogramm und der rnStart der GC/MS-Analyse wurden automatisiert. rnDie Quantifizierung alle Proben wurde über Diffusionsquellen und rnVergleichsmessungen durch auf Adsorptionsröhrchen aufgebrachte rnVerdünnungsreihen realisiert. Um Informationen über die mutmaßlichen Vorläufer des rnsekundären organischen Aerosols zu erhalten, wurde zudem eine Ozon-Scrubber-rnMethode basierend auf Propen entwickelt. Diese wurde anhand von Standards in einer rnReaktionskammer getestet und in Feldmessungen erfolgreich angewendet. rnQuantitative Analysen zeigen, dass die meisten Terpene so vollständig vor der rnOzonolyse bewahrt werden können. Für hochreaktive Analyte wie α-Humulen oder rnβ-Caryophyllen wurden Wiederfindungsraten von über 80 % erreicht. So konnte die rnTemperaturabhängigkeit der Terpen-Emissionen der Fichte (Picea abies) in rnFeldmessungen nachgewiesen werden. rnEine weitere Anwendungsmöglichkeit wurde mit der Unterscheidung verschiedener rnArten der gleichen Gattung anhand der Emissionsmuster und der möglichen rnAbgrenzung verschiedener Bestäubertypen am Beispiel der Gattung Salvia untersucht. rnDie Emissionsanalysen zeigen, dass eine Zuordnung der Verwandtschaftsverhältnisse rnzusätzlich zu anderen Vergleichen möglich ist. Das gleiche gilt für die Differenzierung rnvon Bestäubertypen. Die Ergebnisse der Feldmessungen wurden durch rnMethodenvergleich zwischen biogenen Emissionsmessungen mit anschließender rnTD-GC/MS-Analyse und Extraktionen der jeweiligen Blüten/Blätter mit rnanschließender GC/MS-Messung bestätigt. Volatile {{organic compounds}} (VOCs), especially terpenes, {{are considered to}} be rnprecursors of secondary organic aerosols (SOA). Terpenes are emitted by plants for rndefence or attracting pollinators. Unsaturated compounds like sesquiterpenes are very rnsentitive to ozone and show only low concentrations in the atmosphere. Due to their rnhigh reactivity on many surfaces artefacts were often formed during sampling and rnmeasuring. rnThis work presents results of qualitative and (semi-) quantitative analyses of volatile rnorganic compounds in laboratory studies and in field measurements with plenty of rnbiogenic emissions by thermodesorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry rn(TD-GC/MS). A new thermodesorption unit as an injector for the GC-MS system, rnconsisting of a cryo trap, a desorption oven and a heating, was developed. The TD unit rnis connected to a GC-MS system by a self-made <b>operating</b> <b>interface</b> of Labview®, rnwhich is automatically controlled by a “SPS” (“speicherprogramierbare Steuerung”). rnThe quantification was achieved by external calibration of adsorption tubes by self-rncertified diffusion sources and comparative measurements of liquid samples. A new rnozone scrubber method based on propene was developed to analyze high reactive rnVOCs in the atmosphere. It was tested with standards in a reaction chamber. rnQuantitative analyses showed that most of the terpene can be completely preserved rnfrom ozonolysis. Recovery rates for high reactive analytes such as αHumulen and rnβ-Caryophyllen are higher than 80 %. This technique was successfully applied in field rnmeasurements to analyze monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. So a temperature rndependence of the terpen emission from spruce (Picea abies) has been indicated. rnCorrelations of different species of the same genus and between varied pollinators by rnthe analyses of flower emissions have been tested on Salvia. The results showed that rnTD-GC/MS is a reliable method for classification of the relationship between different rnspecies of the same genus and for correlation of the differentiation of pollinators. The rnresults of the field measurements were conf irmed by method comparison between rnbiogenic emission samples with TD-GC/MS analysis and extractions of the blossoms rnfollowed by GC/MS measurement. rnThe applications of the TD-GC/MS system in field samples from the West-Irish coast rnshowed that not only organoiodides such as CH 3 I and CH 2 I 2 but also monoterpenes rnand sesquiterpenes could be successfully detected. Moreover, correlations between rnanalyte concentration and environmental parameters such as weather conditions and rnlight intensity were found. rnTo sum up, a new TD-GC/MS system has been developed to determine quantitatively rnvolatile, highly reactive analytes in trace levels. The new ozone scrubber provides the rnpossibility of field measurements under high ozone concentrations. The observed rncorrelations and temperature dependence confirm the large applicability and rnconsistency of the method. This method provides a basis for further detailed investigations on SOA precursors and their influencing factors. For a better rnunderstanding more efforts have to be untertaken in the future...|$|E
