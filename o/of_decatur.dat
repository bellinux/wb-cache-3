5|$|For 32 {{years there}} was no {{permanent}} memorial to the victims.

The memorial is located at Lake Park at the northwest corner of Lee and Touhy Avenues, two miles east of the crash site.|$|E
5|$|Decatur House (748 Jackson Place NW) is {{allegedly}} {{haunted by}} the ghost of Stephen Decatur. In 1820, Commodore James Barron challenged Commodore Decatur to a duel over comments Decatur had made regarding Barron's conduct in the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair of 1807. The two men duelled on March 20, and Decatur was mortally wounded in the stomach. Decatur was rushed back to his home, and died there on March 22. A year after Decatur's death, his ghost reportedly began appearing at the house—standing in a second floor window looking out at H Street NW or leaving {{the back door of}} the house with a box of dueling pistols. So many witnesses saw the specter <b>of</b> <b>Decatur</b> that the window was walled up. Some people have also claimed that they can hear his widow, who became hysterical at his death, weeping in the house.|$|E
5|$|M-51 is {{maintained}} by MDOT like other state highways in Michigan. As {{a part of}} these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-51 were the 20,298vehicles daily south of US12; the lowest counts were the 2,658vehicles per day west <b>of</b> <b>Decatur.</b> M-51 between US12 and the state line has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

25|$|The streamliners {{represented}} a last {{attempt by the}} Illinois Terminal to regain lost passenger traffic and were the first new passenger cars the railroad had ordered since 1918. The Illinois Terminal began teasing the new streamliners in 1947, but did not announce the order until May 1948. Its original plan was to place all three in service between St. Louis and Peoria. The first new train in service was the City <b>of</b> <b>Decatur,</b> which began operating between St. Louis, Missouri and Decatur, Illinois (not Peoria) on November 7, 1948. It was the first through service offered by the Illinois Terminal between those two cities.|$|E
25|$|Decatur {{was born}} on January 5, 1779 in Sinepuxent, Maryland, to Stephen Decatur Sr., a {{merchant}} captain and later {{an officer in the}} young American navy during the American Revolution, and his wife Ann (Pine) Decatur. The family <b>of</b> <b>Decatur</b> was of French descent on Stephen's father's side, while his mother's family was of Irish ancestry. His parents had arrived from Philadelphia just three months before Stephen was born, having to flee that city during the American Revolution because of the British occupation. They later returned to the same residence they had once left for Philadelphia. Decatur's family returned to Philadelphia shortly after Decatur's birth, and Decatur grew up in Philadelphia, eventually graduating from the Episcopal Academy.|$|E

Decatur was promoted to captain with the date of rank February 16, 1804. He was promoted to captain at the age twenty-five, largely for his daring capture and destruction of Philadelphia in Tripoli's harbor, making him the youngest man ever to hold the rank.|$|R

25|$|Prosecution {{continued}} {{against the}} other black circus workers. Despite the lack of evidence, seven men were indicted for rape. The NAACP had protested to the city about the lynchings.

Miller was acquitted, but Mason was {{convicted and sentenced to}} serve seven to thirty years in prison. He was a native <b>of</b> <b>Decatur,</b> Georgia, who had been traveling with the circus as a worker. He appealed his case without success. He was incarcerated at Stillwater State Prison, serving four years from 1921 to 1925. He was released on the condition that he would leave the state.|$|E

500|$|At both {{of those}} rugged, mountainous sites, salvage efforts removed the more {{accessible}} and valuable wreckage, but scattered and sometimes substantial portions of the TWA DC-3 and Bonanza Air Lines Fairchild F-27 were left behind, including the DC-3's radial engines. The United Airlines DC-7 crash site, however, has been cleared of all but the smallest artifacts, and is threatened by development. In 1958 the site {{was at least a}} mile from the nearest paved road; today the spot where the DC-7 hit is adjacent to a developed neighborhood near the intersection <b>of</b> <b>Decatur</b> Boulevard and Cactus Avenue. [...] Five decades after the events of April 21, 1958, a small makeshift marker placed in the sandy soil was the only sign of the loss of United Airlines Flight 736, but preliminary efforts were in motion to encourage public officials to build a permanent memorial to those who died.|$|E
500|$|In early March 1830, {{partly out of}} fear of a milk {{sickness}} outbreak {{along the}} Ohio River, several members of the extended Lincoln family moved west to Illinois, a non-slaveholding state, and settled in Macon County, [...] west <b>of</b> <b>Decatur.</b> Historians disagree on who initiated the move; Thomas Lincoln had no obvious reason to leave Indiana, and one possibility is that other members of the family, including Dennis Hanks, might not have attained the stability and steady income that Thomas Lincoln had. After the family relocated to Illinois, Abraham became increasingly distant from his father, in part because of his father's lack of education, and occasionally lent him money. In 1831, as Thomas {{and other members of the}} family prepared to move to a new homestead in Coles County, Illinois, Abraham was old enough to make his own decisions and struck out on his own. Traveling down the Sangamon River, he ended up in the village of New Salem in Sangamon County. Later that spring, Denton Offutt, a New Salem merchant, hired Lincoln and some friends to take goods by flatboat from New Salem to New Orleans via the Sangamon, Illinois, and Mississippi rivers. After arriving in New Orleans—and witnessing slavery firsthand—Lincoln returned to New Salem, where he remained for the next six years.|$|E
