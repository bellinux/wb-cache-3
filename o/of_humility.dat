He had been offered the award as early as 1882, but had repeatedly declined the honor out <b>of</b> <b>humility,</b> until friends from Puerto Rico persuaded him to accept it as a tribute to Puerto Rico, and not as a personal award. The French Legion of Honor (Légion d'honneur) is the premier order of France, and its award is one of great distinction.|$|E
5|$|Vinaya Patrika (विनयपत्रिका), {{literally}} Petition <b>of</b> <b>Humility,</b> is a Braja work {{consisting of}} 279 stanzas or hymns. The stanzas form a petition {{in the court}} of Rama asking for Bhakti. It is considered to be the second best work of Tulsidas after the Ramcharitmanas, and is regarded as important from the viewpoints of philosophy, erudition, and eulogistic and poetic style of Tulsidas. The first 43 hymns are addressed to various deities and Rama's courtiers and attendants, and remaining are addressed to Rama.|$|E
5|$|After the ISIS agents reunite and Drake's mutinous crew {{agrees to}} {{surrender}} {{in order to}} prevent his death, Drake has a mental breakdown, declaring humanity to be doomed and killing himself with Pam's rifle. Cyril, startled by the sudden gunfire, opens fire himself, killing three people (one of whom was the only capable pilot of the shuttle other than Drake). To worsen the situation, Barry Dylan (Dave Willis) challenges Archer to fight him in space. Despite the rigorous taunting and demeaning from Barry, Archer ultimately declines his offer. After Archer makes an act <b>of</b> <b>humility,</b> Cyril aims the launches at Barry's jet, subsequently stranding him on Horizon. As the group nears the airstrip, Archer, who wishes to take credit for the landing, messes with the steering shift, causing the spacecraft to crash. Afterwards, every ISIS agent except for Archer is shown to be injured as a result, especially Ray, who is now paralyzed from the waist down (which he ironically had pretended to be earlier in the season).|$|E

25|$|In Sanskrit {{literature}} of Hinduism, the virtue <b>of</b> <b>humility</b> is explained with many terms, {{some of which}} use the root word, neti (sometimes spelled nati, nti, Sanskrit: नति). Related words include veniti (विनति), samniti (संनति, humility towards), and the concept amanitvam, listed as the first virtue in the Bhagwad Gita. Amanitvam is a fusion word for pridelessness and the virtue <b>of</b> <b>humility.</b> Other related concepts are namrata (नम्रता), which means modest and humble behavior.|$|E
25|$|As the Franciscans {{began to}} preach in China, {{the notion of}} the Virgin <b>of</b> <b>humility</b> {{resonated}} well with the Chinese, partly due to the cultural acceptance <b>of</b> <b>humility</b> as a virtue in China, and partly due to its similarity to the motherly, merciful figure of Kuanyin, which was much admired in south China. However, {{by the middle of the}} 15th century, a dual view had emerged in Europe, as represented by Domenico di Bartolo's 1433 Madonna <b>of</b> <b>humility</b> which expressed the symbolic duality of her nature: an earthly barefoot woman, as well as a heavenly queen. Despite her low, sitting position, the depiction of star and the gems, as well as a halo, signify the regal status of the Virgin, as she is being attended to while she holds the Child Jesus.|$|E

25|$|A miracle {{attributed}} to the fresco of the Madonna <b>of</b> <b>humility</b> painted in about 1370 {{gave rise to the}} construction of the Basilica of Our Lady <b>of</b> <b>Humility</b> in Pistoia, in Tuscany, Italy.

The basilica, built by architect Ventura Vitoni, is an important example of high Renaissance architecture. Giorgio Vasari built the octagonal dome atop the basilica in 1562. The original fresco remains within the basilica.|$|E
25|$|Humility was {{a virtue}} extolled by Saint Francis of Assisi, and {{this form of}} Franciscan piety led to the artistic {{development}} of the Madonna <b>of</b> <b>humility</b> first used by them for contemplation. The Virgin <b>of</b> <b>humility</b> sits on the ground, or upon a low cushion, unlike the Enthroned Madonna representations. This style of painting spread quickly through Italy and by 1375 examples {{began to appear in}} Spain, France and Germany and it became the most popular among the styles of the early Trecento artistic period.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} the {{changing}} perspectives on the Virgin Mary based on specific spiritual views, and its adoption within a culture a world away is {{the transformation of the}} image of Mary from a Heavenly Queen to a mother <b>of</b> <b>humility,</b> and the construction of views to accommodate both perspectives. While depictions of the Virgin Mary as the Queen of Heaven or Coronation of the Virgin by artists such as Paolo Veneziano or Giuliano da Rimini were common {{in the early part of}} the 14th century, they did not fit with the virtue <b>of</b> <b>humility</b> which was a key tenet of the spirituality of Saint Francis of Assisi. The concept of the Virgin <b>of</b> <b>humility</b> was developed in the 14th century in order to accommodate Franciscan piety, by depicting the Madonna sitting on the ground, rather than a throne. It offered a view of the Virgin Mary (often barefoot) as a mother nursing a child, rather than a Queen in a coronation scene.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{painting of}} this type dates to 1346 and is at the Museo Nazionale in Palermo, Italy. It represents a Madonna seated on a small cushion just above the ground. The Child Jesus that she holds partially looks at the viewer. The painting bears the inscription Nostra Domina de Humiltate,with the low cushion intended to express her humility. This painting in Palermo is, however, of a somewhat mediocre quality and was perhaps based on a work of Simone Martini. A similar painting in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, and both paintings were probably based on a Madonna <b>of</b> <b>humility</b> by Martini. A Virgin <b>of</b> <b>humility</b> fresco by Simone Martini survives in the Palais des Papes in Avignon, France.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} five {{studies on}} the development and validation of a scale <b>of</b> intellectual <b>humility.</b> This scale captures cognitive, affective, behavioral, and motivational components of the construct that have been identified by various philosophers in their conceptual analyses <b>of</b> intellectual <b>humility.</b> We find that intellectual humility has four core dimensions: Open-mindedness (versus Arrogance), Intellectual Modesty (versus Vanity), Corrigibility (versus Fragility), and Engagement (versus Boredom). These dimensions display adequate self-informant agreement, and adequate convergent, divergent, and discriminant validity. In particular, Open-mindedness adds predictive power beyond the Big Six for an objective behavioral measure <b>of</b> intellectual <b>humility,</b> and Intellectual Modesty is uniquely related to Narcissism. We find that a similar factor structure emerges in Germanophone participants, giving initial evidence for the model’s cross-cultural generalizability. Ethics & Philosophy of Technolog...|$|R
