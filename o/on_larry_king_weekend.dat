5000|$|Despite being heavily {{associated}} with firearms in his Westerns and police movies, Eastwood has publicly endorsed gun control {{since at least}} 1973. In the April 24, 1973, edition of The Washington Post, the star said, [...] "Im for gun legislation myself. I dont hunt." [...] Two years later, in 1975, Eastwood told People magazine that he favors [...] "gun control to some degree." [...] About a year later, Eastwood remarked that [...] "All guns should be registered. I dont think legitimate gun owners would mind that kind of legislation. Right now the furor against a gun law is by gun owners who are overreacting. Theyre worried that all guns {{are going to be}} recalled. Its impossible to take guns out of circulation, and thats why firearms should be registered and mail-order delivery of guns halted." [...] In 1993, he noted that he [...] "...was always a backer" [...] of the Brady Bill, with its federally mandated waiting period. In 1995, Eastwood questioned the purpose of assault weapons. Larry King, the television host and newspaper columnist, wrote in the May 22, 1995, edition of USA Today that [...] "my interview with Eastwood will air <b>on</b> <b>Larry</b> <b>King</b> <b>Weekend</b> ... I asked him his thoughts on the NRA and gun control and he said that while people think of him as pro-gun, he has always been in favor of controls. Why would anyone need or want an assault weapon? he said." ...|$|E
