30|$|The {{multiple}} regression model used here includes harvesting with a <b>logging</b> <b>vehicle</b> based on relatively high road density. Therefore, {{the regression analysis}} should be recalculated if estimates of forest profitability under other harvesting systems, such as skyline harvesting, are desired. However, this result suggested that forest profitability can be expressed through simplified regression models. In this way, the presented regression model has an advantage in that it can estimate forest profitability through simple calculations. Additionally, the Japanese government hopes to increase road construction to encourage harvesting with <b>logging</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the future (Forestry Agency 2014). Therefore, the regression analysis applied in this study, {{which is based on}} harvesting with <b>logging</b> <b>vehicles,</b> is logical for estimating forest profitability in Japan.|$|R
50|$|In recent years, the East {{has come}} into focus for {{its role in the}} AIDS epidemic. This largely stems from the region's {{position}} as a transportation network for <b>logging</b> <b>vehicles.</b> In addition to the transportation network, the construction of the Chad/Cameroon pipeline has fueled the increase of Prostitution along these routes, with professional sex workers operating in virtually every town and village along the province's roads. Government estimates report the HIV rate among operators of these <b>logging</b> <b>vehicles</b> to be about 18% and that of the sex workers to be as high as 30%.|$|R

50|$|By {{the end of}} 1950's {{competition}} in heavy vehicle market had got harder; the post-war shortage was over and the supply of heavy vehicles had grown. In 1955 Vanajan Autotehdas in Hämeenlinna was seeking for a person who could design a good <b>logging</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Muronen got the post. He started as a chief engineer and later he became production manager in the factory.|$|R
2500|$|Further, loggers {{themselves}} consume high {{amounts of}} bushmeat, eating it {{at a rate}} of two to three times more often than rural families who eat bushmeat roughly two days per week. [...] Logging also allows hunters to kill many more animals on each hunting trip as the hunters no longer need to carry the dead animals such long distances as <b>logging</b> <b>vehicles</b> can transport the animals.|$|R
30|$|Car {{accidents}} {{represent a}} notable percentage of deaths or serious injuries, {{which makes the}} study of driver behavior a crucial issue for understanding and improving road safety.

50|$|The bridge {{operates}} an overload weight {{detection system}} which <b>logs</b> <b>vehicles</b> axle weights. The weigh in motion system uses electric sensors and an ANPR camera. There {{is also a}} camera that takes photos of the vehicle from side-on which can identify the haulage company at fault. The system can also check if HGV axles are lifted when {{they should not be}} and is operational 24 hours a day. Reports can be printed for overweight vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The {{applications}} include semi-trailer haulers, earthmovers, <b>logging</b> <b>vehicles,</b> flatbed haulers and tankers. Bronto Skylift used R-142 chassis for its 32-metre high reaching aerial platforms. The 6×4-driven R-143 {{was targeted}} to poor terrain conditions and closed construction sites without weight restrictions; the 4×4+2-driven R-145 was in particular for logging use {{on and off}} road conditions. The 1978 launched R-146 6×6 was designated to haul heavy flatbed trailers and it was made by combining existing components of the range.|$|R

5|$|The best-known {{hallmark}} of Vanaja, the full-load lifting tandem axle, {{was introduced in}} January 1957. This invention enabled an additional load of 2.5 tonnes to be carried and the entire load on the tandem could be moved to the fore axle using an electro-hydraulic system. The system improved the traction, offering a significant advantage on slippery surfaces. The innovative lifting tandem was developed under leadership of the company's chief engineer Veikko Muronen. Vanaja became the leader in the Finnish <b>logging</b> <b>vehicle</b> market and maintained this position until production ceased. In forestry work, a layout with a driven front axle and a tandem axle with a driven fore axle, called 4×4+2, became famous in Finland but is seldom seen outside the Nordic countries.|$|R
50|$|The first Nemo {{applications}} for vehicles {{to be used}} on roads came in 1963-1964. Nemo was successfully tested in <b>logging</b> <b>vehicle</b> trailers. In addition to improved off-road performance the system had other benefits; a trailer with a driven front axle could be driven on the lorry platform for transition and set down when the place of loading was reached. When full laden, the Nemo {{could be used to}} assist on steep uphills: in case the driver had to gear down, he could switch on the hydraulic drive that was powered directly by the engine, and use clutch and change the gear without risk that the vehicle would stop going. Nemo systems were available for example for Sisu KB-117, M-162 and K-142 logging trucks.|$|R
50|$|The major {{industry}} of the East is forestry. The region has vast tracts of forest, and African and European companies have exploited these heavily. Because {{of the rapid}} rate of exploitation, however, lumber companies {{have been forced to}} push further and further into Central Africa to find suitable trees. As a result, much of the logging that once took place in Cameroon has been relocated to neighbouring countries such as Congo and the Central African Republic. The massive <b>logging</b> <b>vehicles</b> still travel through the East on their way to Cameroon's ports, and it is possible that without the logging industry, the East might never have got the little transportation network that exists there now. The East is also the home of several timber processing centres with major operations located around Bélabo, Dimako, and Mindourou.|$|R
40|$|SkidPC 2000, {{written in}} Visual Basic Version 6. 0, is {{an updated version}} of the 1987 DOS program that calculates the {{mobility}} and productivity of ground-based <b>logging</b> <b>vehicles</b> over a ground profile. As in the original program, the user enters the vehicle and operational conditions and the program will calculate the vehicle speed, productivity, and other aspects of the <b>vehicle,</b> <b>log,</b> and soil interaction. New features {{have been added to the}} program and there has been a complete revision of the program’s user interface. Additions to the program include the ability to model sixwheeled forwarders and clambunk skidders, and the ability to simulate wheel and track rutting. Throughout the updating of the program, small errors in the original version were corrected and the user interface was restructured and streamlined to utilize the features of the Microsoft Windows environment. SkidPC 2000 is an updated tool for operations planners, loggers, foresters, students, equipment salespeople, and others to estimate productivity, ground pressure, velocity, and wheel or track slip. This program can be used to examine relative changes in operational performance to vehicle configuration, vehicle loading, and terrain conditions...|$|R

25|$|With ocean {{access and}} vast tracts of forest, the South {{is home to}} a good deal of industry. Timber is a {{substantial}} part of the region's economy, and various logging companies have operations in the area. However, because the largest trees within the South itself have mostly been harvested, the region is increasingly being used as a transport network for <b>logging</b> <b>vehicles</b> from Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Congo {{on their way to the}} ports of Kribi and Douala. Kribi is also the site of sawmills, and a palm oil mill operates in Lobé. Ebolowa was in past years an important ivory-working center, but government regulations and the scarcity of elephants in modern times have dampened this part of the economy. Much of the South's electricity is produced in hydroelectric power stations on the Ntem and Ma'an rivers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} {{the identification and}} control of an electro-hydraulic crane. The crane is of the type used on forestry vehicles known as forwarders, which travel <b>off-road</b> collecting <b>logs</b> cut by the harvesters. The dynamics identified include significant frictional forces, dead zones, and structural and hydraulic vibrations. The control algorithm proposed, comprised of a linear controller and a compensator for nonlinearities, is able to accurately track a reference trajectory for the end effector, despite uncertainties in the arm mechanics and hydraulic system dynamics. A further control design is presented which uses an inner loop to compensate for vibrations in the hydraulic system, and its performance is experimentally verified...|$|R

50|$|Today, the Forest Service {{carries out}} {{a variety of}} {{management}} and research activities, providing multiple benefits with a strong scientific basis. Sometimes managers must designate different locations for activities that are not compatible, such as wilderness hiking and snowmobiling. It is difficult to actually manage forest while benefiting vegetation, wildlife, recreationists, and industry. For example, those in the timber industry might argue harvesting timber provides wood products that we all use and creates openings which allow sunlight to reach the forest floor to stimulate seedlings, berries and other plants that wildlife need, thus this provides opportunities for berry pickers, birdwatchers and hunters. Environmental and conservation groups may describe this activity as greenwashing logging practices and creating patches of clearcut forests that hurt forest health. The logging and road building for the <b>logging</b> <b>vehicles</b> can pollute streams, destroy habitat, and create vectors for non-native species.|$|R
40|$|Pasminco Century Mine has {{developed}} a geophysical logging system to provide new data for ore mining/grade control and the generation of Short Term Models for mine planning. Previous work indicated the applicability of petrophysical logging for lithology prediction, however, the automation of the method was not considered reliable enough {{for the development of}} a mining model. A test survey was undertaken using two diamond drilled control holes and eight percussion holes. All holes were logged with natural gamma, magnetic susceptibility and density. Calibration of the LogTrans auto-interpretation software using only natural gamma and magnetic susceptibility indicated that both lithology and stratigraphy could be predicted. Development of a capability to enforce stratigraphic order within LogTrans increased the reliability and accuracy of interpretations.
