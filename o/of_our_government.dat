In a letter to Thomas Ritchie in 1821, he stated that [...] "the legitimate meaning of the Instrument must be derived from the text itself; or if a key is to be sought elsewhere, it must be not in the opinions or intentions of the Body which planned & proposed the Constitution, but in the sense attached to it by the people in their respective State Conventions where it recd. all the authority which it possesses." ...|$|E

500|$|On 30 July the Executive Council {{approved}} {{the suspension of}} the levy for two years, from 1 August 2008 to 31 July 2010. After widespread criticism, the government said that maids with advanced contract renewals would {{not be required to}} leave Hong Kong; employers would benefit from the waiver by renewing contracts within the two-year period. According to the government, some employers could benefit from the waiver for up to four years. The effect of turning a two-year moratorium into four-year suspension was denounced by newspapers across the political spectrum, and the levy itself was called [...] "farcical" [...] in a South China Morning Post editorial. Stephen Vines wrote: [...] "The plan for a two-year suspension of the levy... provides an almost perfect example of government dysfunction and arrogance", and Albert Cheng said that the controversy exposed [...] "worst side <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>government</b> bureaucracy". Columnist Frank Ching criticised senior officials for living in ivory towers, and said that {{there would have been no}} disruption if the government had suspended payment immediately and repaid those who had prepaid. Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor called for the levy's permanent abolition, saying that the temporary two-year waiver was discriminatory and criticising the confusion and inconvenience caused to employers by the Immigration Department because the policy had not been thought through.|$|E

Political experts commented that the nature of the ad was groundbreaking. Two days later, an ad campaign was unveiled that included three new 60-second commercials to air on ESPN, CNN and five other cable networks. One commercial entitled [...] "Red Flag" [...] displayed a waving red flag with a background drum roll and the statement: [...] "While the Cold War is ending another war is upon us.

500|$|Negotiations {{over the}} fate of the ships were under way at the Paris Peace Conference. The French and Italians each wanted a quarter of the ships. The British wanted them destroyed, since they knew that any {{redistribution}} would be detrimental to the proportional advantage in numbers they had compared to other navies. Under Article XXXI of the Armistice the Germans were not permitted to destroy their ships. Both Admirals Beatty and Madden had approved plans to seize the German ships in case scuttling was attempted; Admirals Keyes and Leveson recommended that the ships be seized anyway and the crews interned ashore at Nigg Island, but their suggestions were not taken up. Their concern was not without justification, for as early as January 1919, von Reuter mentioned the possibility of scuttling the fleet to his chief of staff. Having learned of the possible terms of the Treaty of Versailles in May 1919, he began to prepare detailed plans to scuttle his ships. Admiral Erich Raeder later wrote that von Reuter was informed that the fleet was to be scuttled at all costs. A further reduction of crews with the departure of two transports to Germany on 18 June 1919 meant that von Reuter was left with reliable men to carry out preparations. On that day he sent out orders, paragraph 11 of which stated: [...] "It is my intention to sink the ships only if the enemy should attempt to obtain possession of them without the assent <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>government.</b> Should our government agree in the peace to terms to the surrender of the ships, then the ships will be handed over, to the lasting disgrace of those who have placed us in this position." [...] His orders were sent to the interned ships on 18 June.|$|E
