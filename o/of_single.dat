40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis Presentation <b>of</b> <b>singles</b> in women's lifestyle magazines (2002 - 2012) {{deals with}} the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>singles</b> and its presentation in selected lifestyle magazines for women in 2002 - 2012. It's divided into a theoretical and an analytical part. The theoretical part focuses on some core themes of media theory, such as the construction of media reality and media influences and effects on values and behavior patterns of the audience, and sociological perspective on the social group called singles. Separate sections are dedicated to the definition <b>of</b> <b>singles</b> and the issue <b>of</b> typology <b>of</b> <b>singles.</b> There is a brief outline of {{the historical development of}} the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>singles</b> followed by a brief discussion on how this phenomenon is perceived by contemporary Czech society. The empirical part is based on a quantitative content analysis, which examines the frequency and character <b>of</b> articles about <b>singles</b> in selected magazines (Cosmopolitan, Elle, Marianne). The hypotheses are based on general principles of media production {{and at the same time}} reflect the fundamental political, economic, social and cultural events that took place during the examined period. The results of the analysis are summarized in the conclusion of the thesis...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the specific amino acid codes, placeholders are used in cases where chemical or crystallographic analysis of a peptide or protein cannot conclusively determine {{the identity of a}} residue.

5|$|In practice, {{there was}} a wide number of {{variations}} to this common design. A castle could {{have more than one}} bailey: at Warkworth Castle an inner and an outer bailey was constructed, or alternatively, several baileys could flank the motte, as at Windsor Castle. Some baileys had two mottes, such as those at Lincoln. Some mottes could be square instead of round, such as at Cabal Trump. Instead <b>of</b> <b>single</b> ditches, occasionally double-ditch defences were built, as seen at Berkhamsted. Local geography and the intent of the builder produced many unique designs.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} a long-held {{assumption}} {{that the majority of}} stars occur in gravitationally bound, multiple-star systems. This is particularly true for very massive O and B class stars, where 80% of the stars are believed to be part of multiple-star systems. The proportion <b>of</b> <b>single</b> star systems increases with decreasing star mass, so that only 25% of red dwarfs are known to have stellar companions. As 85% of all stars are red dwarfs, most stars in the Milky Way are likely single from birth.|$|E
