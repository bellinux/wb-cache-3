25|$|Cryoconservation is an {{indispensable}} {{tool in the}} storage of genetic material of animal origin {{and will continue to}} be useful for the conservation of livestock into the future. Cryoconservation serves as a way to preserve germplasms, which is particularly beneficial for threatened breeds. Indigenous livestock may be conserved for a variety of reasons, including the preservation of local genetics, their importance in local traditions and their value to the culture identity and heritage of the area. The loss of regional livestock diversity could increase instability, decreases future possibilities and challenge production systems. Moreover, the maintenance of indigenous breeds can aid in the preservation of traditional lifestyles and livelihoods, even providing income through cultural tourism. Indigenous breeds can contribute to local economies and production systems by utilising land that is unsuitable for crop production to produce food products, as well as providing hides, manure and draft power. Therefore, the conservation and progression of these breeds are <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>utmost</b> <b>importance</b> for food security and sustainability.|$|E
25|$|As a {{cultural}} nationalist educated by the Irish Christian Brothers, like {{his younger brother}} Willie, Pearse believed that language was intrinsic to {{the identity of a}} nation.

Initially, yielding to the pleas of his sister Constantia, Constantine spared the life of his brother-in-law, but some months later he ordered his execution, thereby breaking his solemn oath. Licinius was suspected of treasonable actions and the army command pressed for his execution. A year later, Constantine's nephew the younger Licinius also fell victim to the emperor's anger or suspicions.

40|$|Low crested {{structures}} are primarily {{designed as a}} coastal defence mechanism, making <b>the</b> prediction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> energy in <b>the</b> lee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>utmost</b> <b>importance.</b> As wave transmission is a measure for the energy that passes the breakwater, experiments on oblique wave transmission have previously been performed by the European project DELOS (Environmental Design of Low Crested Coastal Defence Structures) and analysed further by Van der Meer et al. From these experiments, {{it is unclear whether}} it is the roughness or <b>the</b> permeability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> core that determines <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure. Therefore, <b>the</b> objective <b>of</b> this study is to improve <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> oblique wave transmission through rough impermeable rubble mound submerged breakwaters by means of a 3 D physical model. An experimental study is conducted based on <b>the</b> same set-up <b>of</b> DELOS but <b>the</b> permeability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rough structure will be varied. Finally, by comparing <b>the</b> data <b>of</b> this study with <b>the</b> data <b>of</b> DELOS and <b>the</b> formulations <b>of</b> Van der Meer et al., insight should be gained on the matter. In total, four {{structures are}} tested using irregular long crested waves; ranging from a fully permeable to a fully impermeable rough rubble mound breakwater. In order to test for oblique waves, the model is rotated progressively by 15 °, ranging from 0 ° to 60 °. Secondary effects due to <b>the</b> physical constraints <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wave basin are minimised by placing an additional mound <b>of</b> rubble between <b>the</b> model and <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basin. This prevents a large scale circulation pattern from occurring and reduces wave diffraction effects. The directional spectral analysis software DIWASP is used to calculate the variance density spectra <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data. The wave climate is estimated with the IMLM method (Iterated Maximum Likelihood Method) because it is the most suited to portray the narrow directional spread. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this study is to analyse <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident wave direction βi on the transmitted wave direction βt, the transmission coefficient Kt and <b>the</b> spectral changes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transmitted spectrum. An analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data shows that for rough structures there is no significant change in wave direction. The incident wave direction is approximately equal to the transmitted wave direction (βt= 0. 94 βi for 0 ° ≤ βi ≤ 60 °). <b>The</b> data <b>of</b> this study also show a slight increase in the transmission coefficient with increasing incident wave angle. However, when considering a combined data set, which includes <b>the</b> data <b>of</b> this study and the rough permeable data <b>of</b> DELOS, <b>the</b> data show that oblique wave attack has a negligible influence on the transmission coefficient for rough structures. <b>The</b> spectral changes <b>of</b> this study support the model proposed by Van der Meer et al. Finally, it is concluded that it is <b>the</b> roughness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure rather than <b>the</b> permeability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> core that determines <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breakwater with respect to the incident wave direction.

That if anyone should ask, they should look at their final moments when they gave their lives to their country and that should leave no doubt {{in the mind of the}} doubtful. He explained that fighting for one’s country was a great honour, and that it was like wearing a cloak that concealed any negative implications because his imperfections would be outweighed by his merits as a citizen. He praises the soldiers for not faltering in their execution during the war. That the soldiers put aside their desires and wishes for the greater cause. Because as they are described by Pericles, Athenian citizens were distinct from the citizens of other nations – they were open minded, tolerant, and ready to understand and follow orders. Where their system of democracy allowed them to have a voice amongst those who made important decisions that would affect them. Therefore, he proceeds to point out that the greatest honour and act of valour in Athens is to live and die for freedom of the state Pericles believed was different and more special than any other neighbouring city.|$|E
