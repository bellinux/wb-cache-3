40|$|Part 5 : Operations Management in Engineer-to-Order ManufacturingInternational audienceThe {{purchasing}} function is assuming an increasingly relevant role within {{companies in the}} last decades, taking over the main responsibility for the costs of goods purchased {{as well as for}} supplier management. Its relevancy {{is due to the fact}} that purchasing can contribute to develop competitive advantages by aligning its strategy to the business strategy. Purchasing strategy is usually deployed per (purchasing) category and operationally executed in the so called tactical purchasing process. One key step is the negotiation/bidding where there is a lack of empirical research regarding the application of game theory. This paper contributes by discussing how game theory can be systematically utilised for designing negotiations (i. e. games) and getting more efficient results –by presenting an empirical study <b>on</b> <b>automotive</b> <b>sector</b> company, specifically on a bidding process for constructing a new production facility in Mexico...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{attempts}} {{to support the}} development of industry in Indonesia, especially <b>on</b> <b>automotive</b> <b>sector,</b> {{one of them is}} by replacing import components with local component products. Bushing is one of imported component that widely used on automotive application including motor strater. Bushing usually made of copper alloy such as brass, bronz or babbit in a solid form by casting or extrusion process. In this research powder metal technology is used to process Cu-Al powder to become slide bearing of motor starter. It is expected that powder metal process not only increasing local content in automotive parts but also providing better quality by increasing life time of bushing compared to ordinary one. Cu-Al metal powder was compacted at various pressure, i. e: 250 MPa, 350 MPa and 450 MPa, and then all specimens were sintered at different temperatures : 4000 C, 5000 C dan 6000 C for 1 hour. After sintering specimens were air cooled to room temperature. After physical and mechanical test it can be deduced that bushing made by powder metallurgy method could increase its mechanical properties and as aresult improve its life time operation...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{development}} and innovation {{in science and}} technology have resulted in shorter product life cycle, especially in technology-based commodities like mobile phones and computers. Mounting wastes from such products have received increasing attentions from government, society, as well as industries, and it has created global sustainability concerns. Numerous studies on remanufacturing have been found <b>on</b> <b>automotive</b> <b>sector</b> and durable goods, but only a few studies focusing on short life-cycle products. Even though several studies implied that successful remanufacturing requires products to have long useful life and stable technology, there are several findings that support remanufacturing of short life cycle products. It is our intention to investigate the potential of remanufacturing a short life cycle product. A literature review is conducted to study the pros and cons, life-cycle implication, and remanufacturing aspects of short life cycle products. Then we conduct a survey to obtain descriptive analysis about the market of remanufactured short life cycle products. The factors investigated are market potential, customers’ willingness to pay (WTP), and comparison between remanufactured and reuse products. The surveys results show that remanufactured product’s market segment is low-end customers with highest preference toward remanufacturing and 95 of them chose remanufactured product when the price is less than 40 of new product. However, business to business (B 2 B) returns and consumer returns are best remanufactured and sold at primary market as identical to the new product. We conclude the discussion by proposing a framework for short life-cycle product remanufacturing, which {{can be used as a}} guideline to decide and plan the remanufacturing system...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt is {{evidenced}} that manufacturing firms {{in order to}} be more competitive in market, must continuously update their product offers {{in order to be}}tter satisfy the customers’ requirements. Management should use the supply chain features more frequently, as the increased rate of product introductions, demands more from a business and needs more efforts to deliver the new products effectively and efficiently. To deliver the products at the targeted cost, time, and quality, the supply chain must be aligned with New Product Development (NPD) decisions. This will allow the manufacturing firm to overcome problems such as (partially) failed product launches {{due to the lack of}} product availability because of insufficient capacities. The integrated NPD-Supply Chain Management (SCM) enterprise has the benefit of increased supply chain capability, thus increasing the effectiveness of new product introductions and improves enterprise's performance. This research mainly focuses <b>on</b> <b>automotive</b> <b>sector</b> due to its supply chain environment being the subject of extensive research within its product development integration. The research also introduces the development of a framework that integrates flow of activities within the manufacturing enterprises and shows that this contributes all the business functions. It also aims to focus on using current modelling tools to represent the product development processes of its Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and its suppliers. Through this research, the aim is to link the product development (PD) within a SCM context for an extended enterprise and to investigate the effect of the integration of SCM with NPD. The possible integration points will provide baseline guidelines to identify the key decision making points within the entire supply chain...|$|E
40|$|On {{this this}} document, {{the state of}} the art about engine {{management}} system inspection will be studied during design and prototyping phase. For this reason, a deep background <b>on</b> <b>automotive</b> <b>sector</b> is needed. Automotive history will be reviewed from the creation of first motorized car up to completely autonomous autopilot, created by Tesla. After that, future trends such as hardware and software modularization will be reviewed. Considering cars high complexity, it is important to have a clear method to coordinate and follow-up vehicle design, not only from OEM (original equipment manufacturer) point of view, but also for its suppliers and sub-suppliers. The most common tool to solve this challenge will be work breakdown structure. Main purpose of engine management system was to assure correct function of vehicle engine according driver inputs. As technology evolves and cars have more electronic components interconnected between them, electronic units have increased in quantity and in functions. In case of engine management system, currently is also taking care of safety related components, like throttle-by-wire, start-stop or tailpipe emissions control. In order to identify possible risks of damage and solutions during product manufacturing, process-by-process analysis will be done. Most dangerous risks are related with incorrect operation of machines, manual operations and mechanical damage to the components caused by hits, as electronic assemblies are very fragile. Basic circuits of the EMS are similar that all control units: power supply, inputs, outputs and communication. After analysing most relevant ones, it is possible to judge critical components to inspect. Available inspection methods will be divided into different categories in order to see possible solutions for each circuit inspection: visual check, either manual or automatic and electronic inspection. As a conclusion, it was found that it is possible to inspect each item using different methods and at the same time, different methods are needed to check all items. Furthermore, it is not possible to develop immutable product, process, system, vehicle, etc. This means that current methods may expire soon, but at the same time, they may be a good starting point for future projects and technologies development...|$|E

The states which seek {{to take advantage of the}} global economy by increasing the size of the foreign trade volume create regional and non-regional trade blocs. The European Union (EU), in consideration of the political and economic developments in respect to the Customs Union that it had paid attention to in the 1990 s, revised its trade liberalization policies and moved from the CU to the free trade agreements (FTA). The change in the trade policies in the EU concerns developing economies including Turkey and South Korea. The <b>automotive</b> <b>sector</b> is the sixth largest sector in the world. This industry is one of the most important export areas of developing countries like Turkey and South Korea which seek to improve their welfare by adopting export-based development model. In 1996, Turkey made a trade liberalization agreement with the EU, and South Korea in 2010, to reduce the tariff rates in the field of industrial products. For both countries, the level of influence upon the exports in <b>automotive</b> <b>sectors</b> by the trade liberalization policies holds great importance for the future of the national economies.

40|$|Purpose - This study aims at {{pointing}} out the criteria that encourages or discourages firms to a crosscompany implementation of RFID technology within the supply chain and identifying the most suitable processes. Therefore, this study focuses <b>on</b> the <b>automotive</b> <b>sector</b> in Germany. Design/methodology/approach - A Qualitative Data Analysis was conducted during the underlying study. Within this scope, in-depth interviews with experts of different companies inside the <b>automotive</b> <b>sector</b> served {{as a source of}} qualitative data. Findings - It is found that the chance of an optimization and/or redesign of existing processes is the most important incentive for a cross-company implementation of RFID, while high costs and a lack of industrial standards are the biggest challenges. Furthermore, goods receipt and issue as well as the management of means of production can be identified as the most relevant applications. Research limitations/implications - Only companies involved in a narrow section of the automotive supply chain were interviewed. Upstream and downstream activities were not conducted. Therefore, the present study provides a starting-point for further research not only in the <b>automotive</b> <b>sector,</b> but also in other industries for which this excerpt may also be considered as representative.

40|$|Plastics are {{increasingly}} a preferred material choice in designing and developing complex, consumer products, such as automobiles, {{because they are}} mouldable, lightweight, and are often perceived to be highly recyclable materials. However, actually recycling the heterogeneous plastics used in such durable items is challenging, and presents very different scenarios to how simple products, such as water bottles, are recovered via curbside or container recycling initiatives. While the technology exists to recycle plastics, their feasibility to do so from high level consumer or industrial applications is bounded by technological and economical restraints. Obstacles include the lack of market for recyclates, {{and the lack of}} cost efficient recovery infrastructures or processes. Furthermore, there is a knowledge gap between manufacturers, consumers, and end-of-life facility operators. For these reasons, end-of-life plastics are more likely to end up down-cycled, or as shredder residue and then landfilled. This paper reviews these challenges and several alternatives to recycling plastics in order to broaden the mindset surrounding plastics recycling to improve their sustainability.

The {{mechanism of the}} process includes slow dissolution of the matrix, which acts as an aluminum precursor, and transport of Al-containing species inside the pores, resulting in growth of boehmite fibers and clusters of various morphologies, as confirmed by combined SEM/EDS/XRD/FTIR. These results suggest that deliberate variation of the pH and ionic strength of the hydrothermal medium may represent a promising strategy for controlling the spatial distribution, morphology and dimension scale of the grown boehmite. A complementary approach implies pre-treatment of cellular monoliths in highly-reducing conditions to increase the concentration of surface defects and dangling bonds, facilitating the matrix dissolution and probably acting as nucleation centers, and thus to boost the functionalization level.
