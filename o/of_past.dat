40|$|This paper {{consists}} of two parts.

They differ, however, with respect to the character <b>of</b> this <b>past</b> and the role representation plays in making it present. Second, I also argue that for both Ankersmit and Runia, the presence <b>of</b> the <b>past</b> is always the present <b>of</b> our <b>past,</b> which excludes the experience of the otherness <b>of</b> the <b>past,</b> and which opens both theories to the criticisms of being self-centered and nationalistic...|$|R

The problems <b>of</b> the <b>past</b> reception are closely linked to ensuring national security, as through the understanding <b>of</b> its historical <b>past</b> and the association of events and phenomena in our historical past with meanings and value the process of self-consciousness of the people and its unity takes place. The trauma <b>of</b> the <b>past</b> in the practice of the historical experience reception turns out to be placed in the space of intercultural interaction <b>of</b> the <b>past</b> and present, when through the reception by means of sociocultural practices, the past enters the present, but due to the contradictory perception and ambiguous interpretations by political elites and various social groups of events, situations, and images <b>of</b> the <b>past,</b> "memory gaps " occur, and unordered (unstable) social memory is formed, which hinders ensurin...|$|R
