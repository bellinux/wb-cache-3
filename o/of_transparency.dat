In 2010 the Commission was sued for blocking access to documents on EU biofuel policy. This happened after media accused the Commission of blocking scientific evidence against biofuel subsidies.

It has also been criticised on IT-related issues, particularly with regard to Microsoft.|$|E
5|$|Average wage {{rates in}} the Soviet Union were {{published}} relatively rarely. Some academics in the West believed this was because the Soviet government wanted to conceal low average earnings. Alec Nove wrote in 1966 (when wage statistics were published {{for the first time}} since the Second World War) that the lack <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> surrounding average wages was intended to prevent Soviet workers from discovering the huge disparities that existed between wages in different sectors of the Soviet economy.|$|E

5|$|This period saw a {{political}} alignment with the Eastern Bloc countries and a shift toward economic insularity.

Of these eight, Atlanta-based EarthLink and Minnetonka-based US Internet were selected as semifinalists, and each company set up a trial program in Minneapolis before the final decision was made. During this process, outcry arose from both members of the Institute for Local Self Reliance about the lack of public hearings {{on the subject of the}} network, and from Qwest, another internet service provider who had placed a bid to build and run the network, about the city's plan to be involved in the wireless internet business at all. The deputy chief information officer of Minneapolis, Bill Beck, stated that the city was worried about legal restrictions and lawsuits, which were key reasons for the lack <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> in the process.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{imaging model}} of PDF was, like PostScript's, opaque: each object {{drawn on the}} page completely replaced anything previously marked in the same location. In PDF 1.4 the imaging model was extended to allow transparency. When transparency is used, new objects interact with previously marked objects to produce blending effects. The addition <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> to PDF was done by means of new extensions that were designed to be ignored in products written to the PDF 1.3 and earlier specifications. As a result, files that use a small amount <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> might view acceptably in older viewers, but files making extensive use <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> could be viewed incorrectly in an older viewer without warning.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The major {{purpose of}} this study is to develop {{guidelines}} for making and using transparencies for the improvement of teaching home economics on the secondary level. Another is to show how to use transparencies creatively in teaching. This study will try to help fill a gap in the knowledge of the development <b>of</b> <b>transparencies</b> in home economics. Preliminary information for this study was obtained through letters sent to companies which commercially prepare <b>transparencies,</b> a review <b>of</b> information in the field, and a questionnaire. It was found that there were very few companies interested in the development <b>of</b> <b>transparencies</b> in home economics. The questionnaire was sent to 100 selected Oregon home economics teachers. This questionnaire was returned by 82 of the teachers, but only 76 responses were returned in time to be included in this study. Opinions concerning areas of home economics in which transparencies are needed, choices of lesson planning material to accompany transparencies and preferences concerning transparencies (subject area depth, form <b>of</b> <b>transparencies</b> and sources <b>of</b> <b>transparencies)</b> were asked in the questionnaire. The concepts of values, goals and standards; careers in home economics; building relationships; decision-making; discipline of children; emotional development; safety in child play areas; physical development; babysitting; consumer education and work simplification were selected most frequently as topics from which transparencies should be made. The teachers selected (in order of preference) suggested learning experiences, suggestions for use, suggestions for use in class discussion, teacher read scripts and student read scripts as the type of lesson planning material that they would like to see accompany the transparencies. In the section of the questionnaire concerning the preferences <b>of</b> the <b>transparencies,</b> the results were as follows. Forty-eight of the teachers said that they would prefer a more concentrated study of fewer subjects while 23 stated that they would prefer single concept transparencies, covering many subjects. Fifty-two teachers responded in favor <b>of</b> <b>transparencies</b> which could be made in the audio-visual department of their school, while 21 stated that they would prefer those that were commercially made. The teachers overwhelmingly replied that they wished transparencies to be made from a combination of many resources. There were only two teachers who suggested that the transparencies be keyed to one published book. The results of the preliminary information were used in the development of two sets <b>of</b> <b>transparencies</b> [...] one in the area of child development and the other in the area of family life. Each of the sets was developed using a different basic form for the teaching materials. This was done to show the versatility of this audio-visual material as well as to make the transparencies more meaningful and useful in the classroom. The set on the topic of children's play was accompanied by learning experiences while the set on building relationships was written in script form. The transparencies were designed so that they could be easily teacher made. In the second part of this study guidelines have been developed for the use, selection and development <b>of</b> <b>transparencies</b> in home economics education. These guidelines have been established in order to give teachers a basis for using, selecting and developing transparencies...|$|R

40|$|We {{provide a}} two period model of {{political}} competition in which voters imperfectly observe the electoral promises made to other voters. Imperfect observability generates {{an incentive for}} candidates to offer excessive transfers even if voters are homogeneous and taxation is distortionary. Government spending is larger than {{in a world of}} perfect observability. Transfers are partly financed through government debt, {{and the size of the}} debt is higher in less transparent political systems. The model provides an explanation of fiscal churning; it also predicts that groups whose transfers are less visible to others receive higher transfers, and that imperfect <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> transfers may lead to underprovision of public goods. From the policy perspective, the main novelty of our analysis is a separate evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> spending and the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> revenues. We show that the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> the political system does not unambiguously improve efficiency: <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> spending is beneficial, but <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> revenues can be counterproductive because it endogenously leads to increased wasteful spending. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{exclusive}} {{production of}} vector mesons in deep inelastic scattering {{is a hard}} scattering process with the well controlled size of quark configurations which dominate the production amplitude.
