40|$|The {{participation}} rate {{of women in}} the labor market shows a sizeable variation across countries and across time. Following studies conducted for North America, this section tests the hypothesis whether, next to structural conditions, cultural norms with regard to existing role models within society about working women influence a woman's participation decision. While using the epidemiological approach to economics, which aims to compare economic outcomes between immigrant groups to assess the role cultural factors may play, the persistence of heterogeneity in labor market outcomes across immigrant groups is used to assess the role cultural norms regarding working women may play in explaining differences in labor market outcomes between immigrant groups for first and second generation women in Germany. To overcome the problems associated with a qualitative proxy of culture, such as religiosity or ethnicity, the impact of culture on women working behavior is proxied by past female labor force participation (LFP) rates from the woman's country of origin or their parents, respectively. Using data from the GSOEP for the years 2001 to 2011, compared to findings from Fern 1 ndez and Fogli (2009) and Gevrek et al 2011, which use large census data sets, I find statistically significant results for the association between cultural norms towards labor market behavior of women, as measured either by past female LFP in country of origin, country of <b>origin</b> <b>indicator</b> variables or attitudes towards working women prevalent in their home country, merely for first generation immigrants in Germany. However, while cultural heritage was found to play an inferior role for second generation immigrant women, religious identity, as a specific cultural trait, exhibits a strong negative relation with Muslim labor market behavior for both generations. ...|$|E

40|$|A general fine-scale Bayesian {{quantitative}} trait locus (QTL) mapping method for outcrossing species is presented. It is suitable for an analysis of complete and incomplete data from experimental designs of F 2 families or backcrosses. The amount of genotyping of parents and grandparents is optional, {{as well as the}} assumption that the QTL alleles in the crossed lines are fixed. Grandparental <b>origin</b> <b>indicators</b> are used, but without forgetting the original genotype or allelic origin information. The method treats the number of QTL in the analyzed chromosome as a random variable and allows some QTL effects from other chromosomes {{to be taken into account}} in a composite interval mapping manner. A block-update of ordered genotypes (haplotypes) of the whole family is sampled once in each marker locus during every round of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm used in the numerical estimation. As a byproduct, the method gives the posterior distributions for linkage phases in the family and therefore it can also be used as a haplotyping algorithm. The Bayesian method is tested and compared with two frequentist methods using simulated data sets, considering two different parental crosses and three different levels of available parental information. The method is implemented as a software package and is freely available under the name Multimapper/outbred at URL [URL]...|$|R

Persons (foreign- and Swedish-born) with known diabetes mellitus (DM), aged 16 - 74 years, were chosen from two different counties in Southern Sweden (n= 143 / 1384; 113 / 1564), and from {{a random sample of}} the Swedish population, the annual Swedish Survey of Living Conditions (n= 31 / 446). They were studied by medical records, clinical examination, standardised and structured interviews. Health care staff in diabetes care (n= 149) answered a questionnaire regarding their perceptions of beliefs about health and illness in migrants. Women born in Ex-Yugoslavia and Sweden (n= 13 / 15, 33 - 73 yr) were interviewed in focus groups. Foreign-born, mainly respondents from European countries, stated poorer subjectively perceived health than Swedish-born subjects. This was more strongly related to socioeconomic factors than country of birth as an indicator of migration experiences. No major differences in objective health (prevalence of DM, glycaemic control and complications) were found. Glycaemic control was related to low social position irrespective of <b>origin.</b> <b>Indicators</b> of low social position were risk factors of self-reported DM. Migrants, especially Yugoslavians and non-Europeans, were perceived to differ from Swedes in being less knowledgeable about bodily function and diabetes. Yugoslavian females gave less concrete examples of beliefs about health and illness, focused on migratory experiences, enjoyed life by making deviations from dietary advice and retaining former traditions, were less inclined to self-monitoring and preventive foot care, expressed dependency on health care staff and discussed {{the influence of}} supernatural forces. Thus, beliefs about health and illness differ between migrant and Swedish-born diabetic subjects and are essential for self-care practice and care-seeking behaviour.

40|$|We study {{linkages}} between financial development, international trade, and long-run growth using data since 1880 for seventeen now-developed “Atlantic” economies {{and a set}} of cross-country and dynamic panel data models. We find that finance and trade reinforced each other before 1930, but that these effects did not persist after the Second World War. Financial development has positive effects on growth throughout the sample period, while trade affects growth strongly and independently after 1945. We attribute the rising importance of trade in explaining growth to major post-World War II changes in tariffs and quantity restrictions associated with the GATT, the establishment of the European Common Market, and the gradual elimination of capital controls after 1973. The findings are robust to the use of ‘deep’ fundamentals such as legal <b>origin</b> and <b>indicators</b> of the political environment as instruments for financial development and trade.

The survival of bacteria in groundwater is dependent on many factors including temperature, competition with indigenous bacteria and entrapment in aquifer material. Previous studies showed two sources of faecal contamination of a schist aquifer: infiltration into the ground from nearby septic tank effluents and seepage of landfill leachate. Water samples for bacterial analysis were collected from a piezometer on a monthly basis (15 months) and every six hours over two non-consecutive days. The intermittent sampling showed relatively stable concentrations of bacteria over time after the removal of stagnant water. Therefore, a continuous bacterial contamination without significant daily variation exists. The ratio of E. coli densities to total coliforms densities (EC/TC) allowed differentiation between the sources of faecal pollution in groundwater by comparing the populations of faecal bacteria with those of environmental bacteria. Enumeration indicated that the densities of bacteria were much higher in this schist aquifer than those in alluvial aquifers contaminated by a septic tank reported in the literature...|$|R

The sample comprised 171 Mexicans and 154 Spaniards (N = 325), aged between 18 and 87 years.

40|$|The jets of icy {{particles}} and water vapor issuing {{from the south}} pole of Enceladus are evidence for activity dri-ven by some geophysical energy source. The vapor {{has also been shown}} to contain simple organic compounds, and the south polar terrain is bathed in excess heat coming from below. The source of the ice and vapor, and the mechanisms that accelerate the material into space, remain obscure. However, it is possible that a liquid water environment exists beneath the south polar cap, which may be conducive to life. Several theories for the origin of life on Earth would apply to Enceladus. These are (1) origin in an organic-rich mixture, (2) origin in the redox gradient of a submarine vent, and (3) panspermia. There are three microbial ecosystems on Earth that do not rely on sunlight, oxygen, or organics produced at the surface and, thus, provide analogues for pos-sible ecologies on Enceladus. Two of these ecosystems are found deep in volcanic rock, and the primary pro-ductivity is based on the consumption by methanogens of hydrogen produced by rock reactions with water. The third ecosystem is found deep below the surface in South Africa and is based on sulfur-reducing bacteria consuming hydrogen and sulfate, both of which are ultimately produced by radioactive decay.

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{increasing}} soil anthropisation, large surface areas covered by anthropogenic materials are submitted to environmental factors (e. g. climate, organisms). Pedogenesis of the developing Technosols is often characterized by an intense and rapid weathering (1, 2, 3). However, the nature, localization, and extent of the pedogenetic processes occurring in Technosols are still little known. To assess the soil formation on purely anthropogenic parental materials, a former settling pond of iron industry sludge colonized by vegetation since ca. 50 years was chosen. The soil is composed of contrasted layers, and an organic layer has developed at the surface (4, 5, 6). Composition, mineral and organic components {{and structure of the}} soil were studied as tracers of the material <b>origin</b> and <b>indicators</b> of early pedogenetic processes. Also, historical records regarding the industrial operations were analyzed. Twelve layers were sampled in the first two meters of the profile. Mineralogy was determined with XRD, IR, Mössbauer spectroscopy, SEM and TEMEDS. Spectroscopic and molecular analyses were carried out on solvent extractable organic matter. Thin sections were prepared for some layers. Results showed a stratification of the soil profile resulting from successive sludge supplies. Composition, mineralogy, and structure of the layers of the Technosol were derived from the industrial raw materials and processes. Elemental composition reflected the enrichment in volatile elements, and organic analyses the dumping of oil and combustion by-products. Part of the mineral phases was inherited from raw materials, and others resulted from the industrial processes (e. g. high temperature phases). Pedogenetic processes were obvious with the development of an organomineral horizon. In the deeper layers, analysis of microstructure and mineralogy revealed physical (cracks, solute movements) and chemical processes (dissolution, precipitation). These phenomena occurred primarily in cracks and at the interfaces between two layers. Also, roots, which have colonized the whole profile, and developed preferentially in these areas, have induced changes in their rhizosphere (modification of porosity and metal extractability). In conclusion, the Technosol results from successive steps of pedogenesis, driven firstly by drying-wetting cycles and changes of physico-chemical conditions induced by the climatic factor, and finally by biological processes in relation with root development...|$|R

Methods Three different indicators of green space coverage were derived for a set of 268 small areas in four cities within Britain. The <b>indicators</b> had different <b>origins</b> and provided a spectrum of sensitivity from larger spaces only, through to ambient greenery. Two indicators reproducible for anywhere in Europe were included. Agreement between the indicators on the quantity of green space in a small area, and their independent association with measures of mortality and self-reported morbidity, were compared. Results Overall, the indicators showed relatively close overall agreement (all r 2 &# 62; 0. 89, p&# 60; 0. 001). However, agreement varied by level of area socioeconomic deprivation (p&# 60; 0. 001). The indicator that detected larger spaces only found less green space in areas of socioeconomic deprivation than the other two. Despite this difference, all indicators showed similar protective associations with the risk of mortality and self-reported morbidity suggesting that larger green spaces may be more important for health effects than smaller spaces. Conclusions Associations between green space indicator and health were not sensitive to <b>indicator</b> <b>origin</b> and type. This raises the possibility of trans-European epidemiological studies. Larger green spaces may be the most important for health effects, but may also be less prevalent in more deprived areas. </p...|$|R
40|$|Building on African {{migration}} as {{a household}} survival strategy; urban–rural linkages as critical for migrants' continued engagement with origin communities; reintegration {{in case of}} return; and safety net for supplementing precarious urban incomes; we examine the role of family ties in rural origin linkages among 1, 693 older migrants living in Nairobi informal settlements. Despite the grim of slum residence, 80 % of older migrants in Nairobi slums maintained contact with their rural origin homes during a full year of observation. Family-related factors, especially members of the nuclear family residing in rural origin, explained 45 % of explained linkages. Religion, ethnicity, land ownership at origin, and current health and economic statuses are other key predictors. The patterns and reasons of linkages are consistent with migrants' positive contributions to the upkeep of rural origin households. Our findings are well-anchored in the larger continental literature that has shown the urban migrant as not a ‘disembedded individual’ but instead part of rural origin collectives. Against the weakness of state safety net system, the study sheds crucial light on the enduring importance of sociocultural networks in people's everyday lives, particularly {{the importance of family}} ties for older migrants. To the extent that poor health status, being aged 60 ?years or older, and long duration of residence in the slums, which are predictors of low propensities to maintain contacts with rural <b>origin,</b> are also <b>indicators</b> of diminished social engagement, policy interventions among the urban poor may need to include efforts to enhance rural origin reintegration of the most-aged individuals...|$|R
40|$|Some {{analyses}} of recent {{cosmic microwave background}} (CMB) data have provided hints that there are deviations from Gaussianity in the WMAP CMB temperature fluctuations. Given the far reaching consequences of such a non-Gaussianity for {{our understanding of the}} physics of the early universe, it is important to employ alternative indicators in order to determine whether the reported non-Gaussianity is of cosmological origin, and/or extract further information that may be helpful for identifying its causes. We propose two new non-Gaussianity indicators, based on skewness and kurtosis of large-angle patches of CMB maps, which provide a measure of departure from Gaussianity on large angular scales. A distinctive feature of these indicators is that they provide sky maps of non-Gaussianity of the CMB temperature data, thus allowing a possible additional window into their <b>origins.</b> Using these <b>indicators,</b> we find no significant deviation from Gaussianity in the three and five-year WMAP ILC map with KQ 75 mask, while the ILC unmasked map exhibit deviation from Gaussianity, quantifying therefore the WMAP team recommendation to employ the new mask KQ 75 for tests of Gaussianity. We also use our indicators to test for Gaussianity the single frequency foreground unremoved WMAP three and five-year maps, and show that the K and Ka maps exhibit clear indication of deviation from Gaussianity even with the KQ 75 mask. We show that our findings are robust with respect to the details of the method. Comment: 11 pages, 7 figures. v 2 : To appear in Phys. Rev. D in the present form. Confrontation with WMAP data (Sec.

40|$|As {{the main}} source of inocula, ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal propagules are {{critical}} for root colonization and seedling survival in deforested areas. It is essential to know factors that may affect the diversity and composition of ECM fungal community on roots of seedlings planted in deforest areas during reforestation. We quantitatively evaluated the effect of host plant and soil origin on ECM fungal propagule community structure established on roots of Castanopsis fargesii, Lithocarpus harlandii, Pinus armandii, and Pinus massoniana growing in soils from local natural forests and from sites deforested by clear-cut logging in the 1950 s and 1960 s. ECM root tips were sampled in April, July, and October of 2006, and ECM fungal communities were determined using ECM root morphotyping, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) -RFLP, and ITS sequencing. A total of 36 ECM fungal species were observed in our study, and species richness varied with host species and soil origin. Decreased colonization rates were found in all host species except for L. harlandii, and reduced species richness was found in all host species except for P. armandii in soil from the deforested site, which implied the great changes in ECM fungal community composition. Our results showed that 33. 3 % variance in ECM fungal community composition could be explained by host plant species and 4. 6 % by soil <b>origin.</b> Results of <b>indicator</b> species analysis demonstrated that 14 out of 19 common ECM fungal species showed significant preference to host plant species, suggesting that the host preference of ECM fungi {{was one of the most}} important mechanisms in structuring ECM fungal community. Accordingly, the host plant species should be taken into account in the reforestation of deforested areas due to the strong and commonly existed host preference of ECM fungi...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Natriuretic {{peptides}} {{have emerged}} as important candidates {{for the development of}} diagnostic tools in cardiovascular disease. Their increased concentrations {{have been found to be}} useful for ruling out disease of cardiac <b>origin,</b> as prognostic <b>indicators,</b> and in the follow-up of patients with heart failure. In order for natriuretic peptides to be efficient biomarkers, analytical problems in assay specificity and calibration need to be resolved. The aim of the present study was to elucidate circulating molecular components of N-terminal fragments of A- and B-type natriuretic peptides (NT-proANP and NT-proBNP) in human blood, and to develop reliable and novel assays for their measurement with clinical application. Reliable immunoassays for NT-proANP and NT-proBNP were set up based on recombinant calibrators and antisera against different epitopes. A novel immunoassay for detecting the activation of A- and/or B-type natriuretic peptide systems, referred to as NT-proXNP, was also developed. The chromatographic results of human plasma and serum samples indicated that NT-proANP and especially NT-proBNP are heterogeneous in human circulation. They are truncated at both termini, causing a serious risk of preanalytical errors. Further studies with recombinant peptides confirmed that the central parts of NT-proANP and NT-proBNP are stable in plasma and serum even at harsh storage conditions. Thus the most reliable assays are directed at the central portions of the molecule only. All developed assays were applicable to clinical samples of cardiac patients. NT-proXNP showed a diagnostic efficiency equal to or slightly better compared to individual NT-proANP and NT-proBNP assays. Furthermore, the prognostic value of NT-proANP and NT-proBNP was investigated in a population-based sample of men. Both peptides were strong predictors of mortality and its co-morbidities, adding to the prognostic value of conventional risk factors...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of pathogen bacteria in surface waters {{is a threat}} to public health worldwide. In particular, inadequate sanitation resulting in high contamination of surface water with pathogens of fecal origin is a serious issue in developing countries such as Lao P. D. R. Despite the health implications of the consumption of contaminated surface water, the environmental fate and transport of pathogens of fecal <b>origin</b> and their <b>indicators</b> (Fecal Indicator Bacteria or FIB) are still poorly known in tropical areas. In this study, we used measurements of flow rates, suspended sediments and of the FIB Escherichia coli (E. coli) in a 60 -ha catchment in Northern Laos to explore the ability of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate watershed-scale FIB fate and transport. We assessed the influences of 3 in-stream processes, namely bacteria deposition and resuspension, bacterial regrowth, and hyporheic exchange (i. e. transient storage) on predicted FIB numbers. We showed that the SWAT model in its original version does not correctly simulate small E. coli numbers during the dry season. We showed that model's performance could be improved when considering the release of E. coli together with sediment resuspension. We demonstrated that the hyporheic exchange of bacteria across the Sediment-Water Interface (SWI) should be considered when simulating FIB concentration not only during wet weather, but also during the dry season, or baseflow period. In contrast, the implementation of the regrowth process did not improve the model during the dry season without inducing an overestimation during the wet season. This work thus underlines the importance of taking into account in-stream processes, such as deposition and resuspension, regrowth and hyporheic exchange, when using SWAT to simulate FIB dynamics in surface waters. clos...|$|R
40|$|Esta dissertação é um estudo exploratório que parte de uma proposta de tomar elementos discursivos de entrevistas {{realizadas}} com educadoras que trabalham em escolas de educação infantil da cidade de São Paulo, para constituí-los como indicadores de sucesso da educação inclusiva. Parte-se de uma revisão de literatura a respeito das incidências da inclusão escolar e constata-se que, embora noções de sucesso não tenham sido mencionadas nos trabalhos analisados, há uma preocupação latente quanto ao sucesso e ao fracasso dos processos de inclusão escolar. Tomando este cenário como ponto de partida, buscamos abordar a maneira pela qual a educação inclusiva é entendida na atualidade, tecendo problematizações entre algumas das diferentes perspectivas que embasam esse tema, dentre as quais a psicanalítica mostrou-se uma significativa ferramenta para discutir a natureza das diferentes ocorrências da inclusão escolar, entre elas, os indicadores de sucesso. Procuramos situar indicador quanto ao seu conceito e realizamos uma breve apresentação da origem da utilização de indicadores nas pesquisas psicanalíticas. Esse material nos permitiu realizar uma analogia na elaboração dos indicadores de sucesso da inclusão escolar, o objetivo principal deste estudo. A partir do referencial teórico psicanalítico, mais precisamente a teoria lacaniana dos quatro discursos, pesquisamos, a partir de relatos colhidos com educadoras de educação infantil tomados como elementos discursivos os aspectos referentes a situações de sucesso dos processos inclusivos mencionados, para elaborar indicadores de sucesso da inclusão escolar. Os aspectos colhidos nas entrevistas nos mostram que se os educadores encontram-se implicados com o que é possível realizar no dia-a-dia e no aprendizado com a criança no que é possível ser feito, o processo inclusivo é caracterizado como bem sucedido. As entrevistas, portanto, fornecem dados que nos servem para a caracterização do possível como um indicador de sucesso da inclusão escolarThis dissertation is {{an exploratory}} study {{based on a}} proposal to take discursive elements from interviews conducted with educators who work in childrenś education schools {{in the city of}} São Paulo, and to establish them as indicators of success for inclusive education. It begins with a literature review concerning incidences of school inclusion and it ascertains that, although notions of success have not been mentioned in the studies analyzed, there is latent concern regarding success and failure of school inclusion processes. Using this as a starting point, we seek to address how inclusive education is understood today, weaving problems among some of the different perspectives that are the foundation for this theme, among which psychoanalysis proved to be an important tool for discussing the nature of the different occurrences of school inclusion, including, success indicators. We tried to situate the ïndicator in relation to its concept and we conducted a brief presentation of the <b>origin</b> of <b>indicator</b> use in psychoanalytical studies. This material allowed us to make an analogy in the elaboration of success indicators for school inclusion, this studys main objective. Based on the psychoanalytic theoretical reference, more precisely the Lacanian theory of four discourses, we have researched, based on reports gathered from child education educators taken as discoursives elements the aspects that refer to situations of success for the inclusive processes mentioned, in order to develop indicators of success in school inclusion. The aspects collected from the interviews show us that, if educators are concerned with what is possible to do on their daily activities and on what they learn with the children on what is possible to be done the inclusive process is characterized as successful. The interviews, therefore, provide us with data that distinguishes the feasible as a success indicator of school inclusio...|$|R
