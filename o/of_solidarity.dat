5|$|In December 1981, Poland's Wojciech Jaruzelski {{reacted to}} the crisis by {{imposing}} a period of martial law. Reagan imposed economic sanctions on Poland in response. Mikhail Suslov, the Kremlin's top ideologist, advised Soviet leaders not to intervene if Poland fell under the control <b>of</b> <b>Solidarity,</b> for fear it might lead to heavy economic sanctions, representing a catastrophe for the Soviet economy.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to develop the concept <b>of</b> social <b>solidarity</b> such {{that it can be}} {{compared}} across different societies. This is demonstrated by comparing social solidarity across four different historical societies. This thesis develops the concept <b>of</b> social <b>solidarity</b> through a critical dialogue with the work of Emile Durkheim. By applying contemporary sociological and psychological theory to the concept <b>of</b> social <b>solidarity</b> this thesis develops a conceptual framework <b>of</b> social <b>solidarity</b> such that differing levels and forms <b>of</b> social <b>solidarity</b> can be inferred across societies. In particular this is done by linking human material and psychological needs to social solidarity. This thesis argues that those social institutions which meet the needs of people also increase the level <b>of</b> social <b>solidarity</b> between those people. By examining social institutions {{and the degree to which}} they meet people's needs it is possible to infer the extent <b>of</b> social <b>solidarity</b> in that society. This thesis goes on to apply this procedure to four forms of society, feudal, early industrial, Fordist and neo-liberal societies. This thesis argues that the shift from feudal society to industrial capitalist society caused a significant decline in the level <b>of</b> social <b>solidarity,</b> although this social transformation was not without potential for generating a society with a much higher level <b>of</b> social <b>solidarity.</b> Fordist society is an example of one possible society which merges a high level <b>of</b> social <b>solidarity</b> with industrial capitalism. However the brief nature of Fordist society suggests that the underlying logic of capitalism may make such a society with high social solidarity unsustainable...|$|R

5|$|Next year, in February 1991, Marian Krzaklewski {{was elected}} the leader <b>of</b> <b>Solidarity.</b> President Wałęsa's vision {{and that of}} the new Solidarity {{leadership}} were diverging. Far from supporting Wałęsa, Solidarity was becoming increasingly critical of the government, and decided to create its own political party for action in the upcoming 1991 parliamentary elections.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} <b>of</b> <b>Solidarity</b> and {{the political}} liberties that the movement brought paralyzed the authoritarian state and the state-controlled economy. Everyday life was becoming increasingly unbearable and the public displayed sentiments of extreme volatility. The hostility of the nomenklatura toward Solidarity was rapidly increasing.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} support for the Solidarity was unique: no other {{movement}} in the world was supported by Ronald Reagan and Santiago Carrillo, Enrico Berlinguer and the Pope, Margaret Thatcher and Tony Benn, peace campaigners and NATO spokesman, Christians and Western communists, conservatives, liberals and socialists. The international community outside the Iron Curtain condemned Jaruzelski's actions and declared support for Solidarity; dedicated organizations were formed for that purpose (like Polish Solidarity Campaign in Great Britain). US President Ronald Reagan imposed economic sanctions on Poland, which eventually would force the Polish government into liberalizing its policies. Meanwhile, the CIA together with the Catholic Church and various Western trade unions such as the AFL-CIO provided funds, equipment and advice to the Solidarity underground. The political alliance of Reagan and the Pope would prove important to the future <b>of</b> <b>Solidarity.</b> The Polish public also supported what was left of Solidarity; a major medium for demonstrating support <b>of</b> <b>Solidarity</b> became masses held by priests such as Jerzy Popiełuszko.|$|E

5|$|Anniversaries of {{the most}} {{important}} events of Stephen's life have been officially celebrated since the 1870s, including in 1871 the defiant show <b>of</b> <b>solidarity</b> at Putna. This doubled as a protest against Austria-Hungary, which had annexed Bukovina; it was organized by Teodor V. Ștefanelli and was notably attended by poet Mihai Eminescu. Nationalist interpretations still prevailed, particularly after 1881, when Eminescu dedicated his poem Doina (written in the style of traditional Romanian song) to Stephen, calling upon him to leave his grave to again lead his people. His statue was ultimately raised in Iași in 1883.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{popularity}} {{with the people}} of the Arab world, by mid-1957 his only regional ally was Syria. In September, Turkish troops massed along the Syrian border, giving credence to rumors that the Baghdad Pact countries were attempting to topple Syria's leftist government.

40|$|The {{underlying}} {{notion of}} this study is to describeGelumpai manuscript. Gelumpai manuscript is defined ascollective memoriesthat contain historical values of Palembang society. Correspondingly, collective memories in Gelumpai manuscript contain the values <b>of</b> social <b>solidarity</b> <b>of</b> Palembang society. The social solidarity has been formed in harmony since the early age. This could be portrayed from the existing multicultural aspects in the script of Gelumpai written inka-ga-nga characters and kromoinggil language (the highest level of Java language) in which it narrates the majesty of Prophet Muhammad. Accordingly, this study aims to explore the social <b>solidarity</b> <b>of</b> Palembang society by using ashabiyah theory from IbnuKhaldun. It uses descriptive-qualitative method with local wisdom approach. The research proposes Gelumpai manuscript as the construction <b>of</b> social <b>solidarity</b> <b>of</b> Palembang society...|$|R

5|$|During {{the chaotic}} years <b>of</b> <b>Solidarity</b> and martial law, Poland entered {{a decade of}} {{economic}} crisis more pronounced than in Gierek's years. Work on the major unfinished projects that had begun in the 1970s drained the available investment outlays, little money was left for replacing obsolete production equipment and the manufactured goods were not competitive on the world market. Managerial ineffectiveness, bad organization of production and shortages of inputs and raw materials were among the factors that contributed to further deterioration of workers' morale. 640,000 people of productive age left the country between 1981 and 1988.|$|E
5|$|Grameen Bank is {{best known}} for its system <b>of</b> <b>solidarity</b> lending. The Bank also {{incorporates}} a set of values embodied in Bangladesh by the Sixteen Decisions. At every branch of Grameen Bank, the borrowers recite these Decisions and vow to follow them. As a result of the Sixteen Decisions, Grameen borrowers have been encouraged to adopt positive social habits. One such habit includes educating children by sending them to school. Since the Grameen Bank embraced the Sixteen Decisions, almost all Grameen borrowers have their school-age children enrolled in regular classes. This in turn helps bring about social change, and educate the next generation.|$|E

5|$|In 1980 AFL–CIO President Lane Kirkland {{appointed}} Kahn {{to organize}} the AFL–CIO's support <b>of</b> <b>Solidarity.</b> The AFL–CIO sought approval in advance from Solidarity's leadership, to avoid jeopardizing their position with unwanted or surprising American help. Politically, the AFL–CIO supported the twenty-one demands of the Gdansk workers, by lobbying to stop further U.S. loans to Poland unless those demands were met. Materially, the AFL–CIO established the Polish Workers Aid Fund. By 1981 it had raised almost $300,000, which was used to purchase printing presses and office supplies. The AFL–CIO donated typewriters, duplicating machines, a minibus, an offset press, and other supplies requested by Solidarity.|$|E

5|$|Nonetheless, {{some social}} scientists, such as Zbigniew Brzezinski and Frank Gibney, refer to these changes as a revolution, one less {{dramatic}} than its Hungarian counterpart but one {{which may have}} had an even more profound impact on the Eastern Bloc. Timothy Garton Ash calls the Polish October the most significant event in the post-war history of Poland until the rise <b>of</b> <b>Solidarity.</b> History professor Iván T.

5|$|On December 18, a hundred-member Citizens' Committee (Komitet Obywatelski) {{was formed}} within Solidarity. It {{comprised}} several sections, each responsible for presenting a specific aspect of opposition demands to the government. Wałęsa {{and the majority}} <b>of</b> <b>Solidarity</b> leaders supported negotiation, while a minority wanted an anticommunist revolution. Under Wałęsa's leadership, Solidarity decided to pursue a peaceful solution, and the pro-violence faction never attained any substantial power, nor did it take any action.|$|E
5|$|The {{fall of the}} {{communist}} regime marked {{a new chapter in}} the history of Poland and in the history <b>of</b> <b>Solidarity.</b> Having defeated {{the communist}} government, Solidarity found itself in a role it was much less prepared for — that of a political party — and soon began to lose popularity. Conflicts among Solidarity factions intensified. Wałęsa was elected Solidarity chairman, but support for him could be seen to be crumbling. One of his main opponents, Władysław Frasyniuk, withdrew from elections altogether. In September 1990, Wałęsa declared that Gazeta Wyborcza had no right to use the Solidarity logo.|$|E
