After all, to say that our law is human rights compatible {{is not to say that}} it is just, a distinction that I will interrogate in a moment. But I do believe that a human rights approach can provide an important component of critical enquiry into the quality of the law. Violation of human rights is a distinctive kind of injustice, one that deserves to be marked out as special. It is in this spirit that I offer an investigation of whether there is a human right to a fair criminal law. To make progress in that enquiry, we will need to know something about how best to understand human rights. I am interested here, I should say, not in the human rights that we have agreed in human rights documents such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or the European Convention of Human Rights. We can easily agree that there is no human right to a fair criminal law in this positivist sense. But human rights documents may be flawed: they may institutionalise as human rights things that are not really human rights at all and they may fail to institutionalise things that are human rights.

40|$|The most {{important}} variable affecting whether a defendant {{will be subject}} to the death penalty is often the particular ideology of the district attorney of a respective county. More subtle forms of arbitrariness, such as bias based upon race, gender and class, also pervade the process.

This research project will focus on the use of Forum and Documentary theatre techniques with the main focus being on the effect of these techniques in British prisons but will also include data from America and Brazil. It is well known that offending and reoffending rates in Britain are on the rise. This in turn has led to an ever-increasing British prison population. Today, finding successful ways of rehabilitating offenders for life back into the community has never been more important. “As <b>our</b> nation’s <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>systems</b> focus on preparing offenders for successful re-entry to our communities, the revolutionary results that can be achieved through performance-based arts programmes demand our attention” (Performing New Lives, 2011, p. 7).

40|$|This article aims {{to discuss}} {{restorative}} justice, an alternative form of conflict management, through {{a theoretical framework}} of the theories of punishment, or more specifically, the modern penal rationality, as coined by Pires (2013). The idea is to demonstrate how restorative justice escapes modern penal rationality, presenting itself {{as an alternative to}} the system of ideas that underlies <b>our</b> current <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system.</b> The methodology is qualitative and the research came from a case study of restorative justice programs in the state of São Paulo, as well as interviews with professionals and participant observation of restorative circles that happened at a school in the city of São Caetano do Sul (SP). The results demonstrate that restorative justice, despite its transformative potential, still has been facing difficulties to be implemented. The resistances are related to legal professionals and the population that is served by these programs that do not understand the model as expertise (case of legal professionals), or as a benefit for those involved (case of adolescents and their families), as both groups still perceive conflict management in punitive terms. The research findings show us that restorative justice can be considered as an innovation, because it pressures the <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> by proposing a new form of conflict management that shifts the focus from punishment to the restoration of the relationships affected by the conflict.

Our consistent faith in prosecutors’ expertise, Bowers argues, is not only misguided but backwards; we should value outsiders’ fresh perspectives over insiders’ jaded expertise.

40|$|The <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> has {{traditionally}} been seen as {{in the business of}} doing justice: punishing offenders for crimes committed. Yet, the past decade has brought a shift from punishing past crimes to preventing future crimes through the incarceration and control of dangerous offenders. Habitual offender statutes, like "three strikes" laws, sentence repeat offenders to life imprisonment. Jurisdictional reforms lower the age at which juveniles may be tried as adults, inc reasing th e available terms of imprisonment beyond those of juvenile court. Gang membership and recruitment are criminalized. "Megan's Law" statutes require community notification of a convicted sex offender. "Sexual predator" statutes provide for civil detention of offenders who remain dangerous at the conclusion of their criminal term. Sentencing guidelines increase the sentence of offenders who have a prior criminal history, for these offenders are seen as the most likely to comm it future crimes. The shift from punishment toward prevention has not been accompanied by a corresponding change in how the system advertises itself. It still presents itself as a system of crimin al "justice" that imposes "punishment. " It is imp ossible, of course, to punish dangerousness, within the meaning of those terms. To "punish" is "to cause a person to undergo pain, loss, or suffering for a crime or wrongdoing. " Punishment can only exist in relation to a past harm or evil. "Dangerous" means "likely to cause injury, pain, etc.," that is, a threat of future harm. One can "restrain" or "detain" or "incapacitate" a dangerous person, but one cannot logically "punish" dangerousness. Yet <b>our</b> current <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> increasingly fosters ambiguity between punishment and prevention, as if one could punish dangerousness.

40|$|In this essay, I discuss my {{experience}} with institutional indifference during a brief stay at a medium security local jail in Southeastern Louisiana and the conditions, circumstances and participants involved in my sexual assault. In this discussion, I intend to offer an “insider’s account” {{as a type of}} autoethnographic method of inquiry whose purpose is to expose readers to the complex dynamics of life within a correctional system for a young, middle class, college educated, gay 1 man of colour. This “insider’s account” attempts to describe the conditions and circumstances of my incarceration, which contributed to my sexual assault and the ensuing analysis of that event. I begin with a discussion of my methodology, specifically my decision to employ the autoethnographic method and the application of “convict criminology” in the elaboration of my personal narrative. Then, I present that narrative – which describes {{my experience}}s while incarcerated that lead up to and included my attempted assault – followed by some analysis about prison culture, both general and specific to the institution where I was held, in tandem with an exploration of prison sex and sexual culture, and the discourses of safety that proliferate outside its walls. Finally, I conclude with a discussion about the politics of prison rape and sexual assault that include a summary of, and my personal reactions subsequent to, my release from both the institution and my attacker. The objective in writing this essay is to better inform readers about the socioeconomic, racist and homophobic obstacles that faces those familiar and unfamiliar with <b>our</b> Nation’s <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> and the very real, very frightening problems of sexual assault that gay men must encounter and negotiate – every day, of every week, of every year within that system...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project comprises a stage play Section 24 of the Criminal Code, and accompanying exegesis, which focuses upon {{the experience of}} a woman accessing the <b>Criminal</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>system</b> after she is raped. The play is in the verbatim model and draws upon court transcript, which is deconstructed to reveal the workings of Defence counsel 'storylines' and meta-narratives of gender, sexual availability and power. The exegesis investigates attitudes toward rape and rape victims perpetuated by Australian popular culture, and the way that myths about false rape complaints and 'deserving victims' continue to influence the reporting and conviction rates for rape. The thesis argues that recent reforms have yet to make an impact on the conviction rate or experience of women accessing the <b>Justice</b> <b>system,</b> because of entrenched misogyny within the system itself. Several factors contribute to widespread ignorance of the reality of <b>our</b> own <b>Criminal</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>system,</b> and the thesis proposes that a work of verbatim theatre may redress the paucity of understanding that enables the dysfunction of the current system. The paper explores the different approaches taken by Verbatim theatre practitioners and the appropriateness of the Verbatim theatre model for communicating this particular (lived) experience. Questions of ownership over one's story, and representation in that story indicate the emancipatory potential of a work. Where practitioners do not have a personal connection to their subject matter or material and access material that is already in the public domain, they may feel a greater freedom to manipulate story and character for dramatic effect, or to suit an activist agenda for change. It is shown that a playwright with a personal connection to her material and subject must address issues of ownership, ethical representation, veracity and verisimilitude when creating a piece of verbatim theatre. Preferencing the truth of the Complainant Woman's experience over the orthodoxies of the well-made play may contribute to a negative response to the work from male audiences. However, the thesis concludes that the subject of rape and its prosecution invokes a gendered response in itself, and ultimately questions the desirability of presenting a play that delivers a palatable story rather than an unpleasant truth...|$|R

Following {{incidents}} {{such as the}} 1999 {{shooting at}} Columbine High School, governments and school districts have responded with the increased incorporation of police, also known as School Resource Officers (SROs). This critical study deconstructs the recent trend utilizing Bowles and Ginitis??? 1976 theory on schooling in a capitalist society, the Prison-Industrial Complex (PIC), the School-to-Prison Pipeline (S 2 PP), and additional theories on crime and race. In-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} SROs from six different public high schools in Sacramento, CA. Each were asked a series of questions revealing the overall role and effects of SROs, as well as their personal explanations of student crime and violence to see if their responses were symbolic of any of the aforementioned theories. Their individual responses were analyzed and discussed in relation to the outlined theoretical framework. It was found that SROs support some of the arguments of the theory on schooling in a capitalist economy and they can also be viewed as contributors to the PIC and a S 2 PP. However it was also found that they counter such perspectives through additional roles they fulfill on campus such as mentoring and creating a safer learning environment.
