5|$|Counting {{symmetry}} partitions valid Band1 permutations into {{classes that}} place the same completion constraints on lower bands; all members <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>band</b> counting symmetry equivalence class {{must have the}} same number of grid completions since the completion constraints are equivalent. Counting symmetry constraints are identified by the Band1 column triplets (a column value set, no implied element order). Using band counting symmetry, a minimal generating set of 44 equivalence classes was established.|$|E

Using this result, we devise a fast algorithm for the solution of linear systems of equations involving such matrices.

40|$|Contour-clamped {{homogeneous}} {{gel electrophoresis}} has increasingly been used and {{has generally been}} considered the method of choice for the delineation of enterococcial strains. It {{has been suggested that}} the contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) electrophoresis digestion patterns of genomic DNA indicate the relatedness of strains when SmaI patterns differ by six or fewer bands. To evaluate the potential reasons for the diversity of bands among clonally related isolates, we studied plasmid-free Enterococcus faecalis FA 2 - 2 and derivatives with transposon Tn 916 (encoding for tetracycline resistance) insertions on the chromosome. We obtained derivatives with seven different Tn 916 insertion sites and up to two copies of Tn 916 on the chromosome, resulting in differences of one to seven bands by CHEF electrophoresis; eight different patterns were observed. With Tn 916 insertions, there was either (i) loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>band(s)</b> with the generation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new <b>band(s),</b> (ii) the generation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new <b>band(s)</b> only, or (iii) the loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>band(s)</b> with no new visible band(s). These results indicate that strains can have up to seven different SmaI bands by CHEF electrophoresis and still be closely related...|$|R

5|$|Essgee Entertainment {{produced}} an adapted version of Pinafore in 1997 in Australia and New Zealand {{that has been}} much revived. Another musical adaptation is Pinafore! (A Saucy, Sexy, Ship-Shape New Musical), adapted by Mark Savage. It was first performed at the Celebration Theater in Los Angeles, California on 7 September 2001, directed by Savage, where it ran with great success for nine months. It then played in Chicago and New York in 2003. In this adaptation, only one character is female, and {{all but one of}} the male characters are gay. An original cast recording was issued in 2002 by Belva Records. Pinafore Swing is a musical with music arranged by Sarah Travis. It premiered at the Watermill Theatre in England in 2004 in a production directed by John Doyle. The adaptation, set in 1944, changes the characters into members <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>band</b> entertaining the sailors on a World War II troop ship in the Atlantic. The reduced-size acting cast also serve as the orchestra for the singing roles, and the music is infused with swing rhythms. Numerous productions in recent decades have been set to parody Star Trek or Star Wars.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, Madonna {{was trying}} to {{establish}} her career in the music industry. She was the drummer <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>band</b> called Breakfast Club, which was headed by the Gilroy brothers, Dan and Ed. After their lead female vocalist left, Madonna was given {{the role of the}} lead female singer. However, she wanted to be the only female voice of the band, and opposed against the introduction of another female vocalist, Angie Smith. This led to a dispute between Dan and her, which resulted in Madonna leaving the band. She then formed a new band called Madonna and The Sky, but that also faced a major problem within a few weeks when its principal drummer Mike Shenoy, who had a full-time job and a fiancé, decided to leave the band.|$|E

He commanded 30–40 men, {{one of whom was}} Archie Clement, an 18-year-old with a predilection for torture and mutilation who was loyal only to Anderson. By late July, Anderson led groups of guerrillas on raids, and was often pursued by Union volunteer cavalry. Anderson was under Quantrill's command, but independently organized some attacks.|$|E

5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century brass bands had a poor {{relationship}} with the Nonconformist chapels, mainly due to the heavy social drinking that came {{hand in hand with}} being a member <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>band.</b> This changed {{towards the end of the}} 19th century, and as well as becoming more respectable, many bands had actually joined the temperance movement. Two of the more well known brass bands from the Rhondda both started as temperance bands. The more famous, Cory Band from Ton Pentre, started life as Ton Temperance in 1884; while local rivals The Parc and Dare Band were the Cwmparc Drum and Fife Temperance Band.|$|E

5|$|The UK {{had been}} a home for music video pioneers. When the music video cable channel MTV started {{broadcasting}} in 1982, the importance of videos abruptly grew, changing the video from an occasional promotional tool to an indispensable means of reaching an audience. MTV filled its programs with many hard rock and heavy metal videos, but these were too expensive for bands who either had no recording contract or had signed to small, independent labels. Moreover, music videos exalted the visual appeal <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>band,</b> an area where some British metal groups were deficient. So the NWOBHM suffered the same decline as other musical phenomena that were based on low-budget productions and an underground following. Many of its leaders, such as Diamond Head, Tygers of Pan Tang, Angel Witch and Samson, were unable {{to follow up on}} their initial success; their attempts to update their look and sound to match new expectations of the wider audience not only failed, but also alienated their original fans.|$|E
