50|$|The {{itinerary}} {{is made up}} of 11 rooms, {{dealing with}} different aspects of oil and olive trees. It begins with scientific information on olive trees: its botanic features and traditional and innovative systems of <b>olive-growing.</b> A millstone with animal traction and a huge millstone with hydraulic traction show, together with pictures and didactic panels, the long evolution in oil extraction techniques.Mythology related to olive oil is then dealt with. Great attention is paid to the goddess Athena who, according to Greek mythology, offered mankind the first domesticated olive tree. Masterpiece of this section is a red-decorated Attica alabastron (a type of pottery for holding oil) portraying the goddess Athena, ascribable to Foundry Painter (5th century B.C.). Other pieces of the collection are a tribute to Athena’s civilizing action (as holder of technological knowledge) as to war, vessels, agriculture and housekeeping.The third section concerns landscape. Most of Umbria is cultivated with olive trees. Such feature has always impressed travelers and visitors who, during their so-called Grand Tour, would record their emotions and interest in the landscape in their note-books, in sketches or descriptions. This section contains cadastres, maps and other objects recalling such Grand Tour. The following rooms tell the traditional uses of olive oil: the most ancient (oil as a source of light) is documented through a number of oil lamps from the pre-Classical era to Neoclassicism. The remaining rooms describe how oil has been used {{in a wide range of}} sectors: ritual usage in Christianity, Islam and Judaism; usage in sport, food, scents and ointment preparation; sphragistics, weaving and wood-processing.The last room of the museum gathers a variety of symbolic elements which, over the centuries, have contributed to consider olive oil and olive trees as sacred and gifted of magic and curative power.|$|E

40|$|In this chapter, we are {{concerned}} with performance evaluation of olive oil production using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) under uncertainty. In order to measure production efficiency of <b>olive-growing</b> farms, we first apply an imprecise DEA approach by taking into account optimistic and pessimistic perspectives on uncertainty realized in olive oil production yield. We then consider robust optimization based DEA under an uncertainty set where the random data belong. The robust DEA model enables to adjust level of conservatism that {{is defined by the}} price of robustness of the uncertainty set. The performance of imprecise and robust DEA models is illustrated via a case study of <b>olive-growing</b> farms located in the Aegean Region of Turkey. The numerical experiments reveal that the efficiency scores and efficiency discriminations dramatically depend on how the uncertainty is treated both in imprecise and robust DEA modeling. There exists a trade-off between the protection level and conservatism of the efficiency scores. ...|$|E

40|$|Regardless of {{the fact}} that the {{traditional}} usage of rural landscapes was agricultural, a degradation of landscape values, as well as an onset of natural succession, occur due to contemporary lifestyle. This can lead to negative effects regarding land-use change. This paper focuses on the south-eastern part of Pag island and explores the possibilities for the revitalisation of its neglected areas by envisioning its future development as an <b>olive-growing</b> region. The final goal was to define a planning procedure framework which would enable the creation of a strategic vision to be transformed into a comprehensive spatial development strategy for the research area. This area encompasses the territory between Kaštela in the north-west and the Pag’s bridge in the south-east which administratively belongs to the Zadar County and includes the Town of Pag, and the Kolan and Povljana municipalities. <b>Olive-growing</b> has been recognized as the strategic choice for development because of its tradition in the area and the potential integration with other relatable activities. Based on the SWOT analysis, an appropriate mission, a vision and strategic goals were defined for developing Pag as an <b>olive-growing</b> region. Further landscape planning methods included (1) the Lynch mapping analysis, (2) the Forman and Godron landscape ecology analysis and (3) the landscape pattern analysis. The results were then used together with digital orthophoto imagery to overlay and analyse relevant information. Hand drawings as well as AutoCAD, ArcGIS and image editing computer programmes were used in the process. This analytical phase was then followed by the development of several alternative spatial zonings, diagrams and concepts based on a preferable neighbourhood matrix and the activity sizing table. The planning process resulted in a concept for spatial development of the research area which would enable the implementation of the strategic vision. The main goal of this planning procedure was to preserve and improve the rural landscape of Pag island...|$|E
40|$|Phytophthora {{root and}} crown rot has been {{traditionally}} considered a minor disease of olive. However, {{in recent years}} it has been recognized as an emerging problem in several <b>olive-growing</b> countries such as Australia, Italy and Spain probably {{as a consequence of}} the expansion of plantings in new areas with heavy soils and the more intensive use of irrigation in both olive nurseries and commercial groves. The disease has been reported from most <b>olive-growing</b> countries and is caused by several soil -borne species of Phytophthora, including P. cinnamomi, P. citricola, P. cryptogea, P. drechsleri, P. gonapodyides, P. inundata, P. megasperma,P. nicotianae and P. palmivora. Diagnosis is currently based on the isolation and identification of isolates by both traditional and molecular methods. New molecular techniques are currently available that could be applied for both the identification of isolates and Phytophthora infections directly in host-tissues as well as insoil and water samples.

In this study we perform an environmental and economic assessment of two <b>olive-growing</b> systems: the “High Density” (HDO) and the “Super High Density” (SHDO). The analysis integrates the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the Life Cycle Costing (LCC) methods by using a common database. The environmental analysis carried out through LCA has shown a better performance of the HDO system for all the impact categories, due to a lower use of energy and chemical inputs and to higher olive yields. Also from an economic point of view the HDO could be considered more convenient than the SHDO: in fact, despite the lower operating costs of the latter due to the complete mechanization of pruning and harvesting operations, these costs are counterbalanced by higher initial investment costs that the company {{has to face}} which are three times those of the HDO system. The total result is that the Net Present Value is better for the HDO for each olive price level. This result is mainly driven by lower plantation costs, longer production cycle, higher production of olives and higher efficiency in the use of inputs which characterize the HDO model...|$|E

In particular, the agricultural enterprise {{has to deal with}} new market challenges and new needs of society which consequently affect the development of new competitive strategies. In this context, it becomes important to formulate new models to evaluate the pathways of value creation. For this purpose, a methodological approach was developed for the analysis of these paths “Value Portfolio and Multifunctional Governance Analysis” in which the value creation is a function of a portfolio of values that include diversification/differentiation on farm, valorisation of local resources and integration with the different activities and specificities of the territory. This paper aims to test this approach by studying the paths of value creation for the olive oil sector of “Colline Salernitane”. In particular, the analysis focused first {{on the role of the}} determinants for the creation of the values portfolio (specific business resources, land resources, policy and market) for the traditional <b>olive-growing</b> farms and then on companies that have chosen processes of boundary shift and, regard to the latter, we studied the impact in the choice of activity of deepening or broadening.

40|$|This paper {{shows some}} results arisen from a wider {{research}} on {{economic and environmental}} sustainability of organic farming. It focuses on organic and conventional farming comparison through an investigation of Italian FADN data. In order to identify {{some of the main}} differences between organic and conventional farms a “distance analysis” has been carried out. The study aims to highlight some of the main characteristics of those two groups of farms to better address differences (if any) in production technology, costs and revenues. Furthermore it shows the findings of a non-parametric efficiency analysis on the Italian <b>olive-growing</b> farms. The purpose is to estimate difference in efficiency and productivity between organic and conventional olive producers. Results reveal that looking at the average values on Invested Areas, conventional farms’ Gross Production is significantly higher than the organic ones, as the Net Margin, as the Net Product and Costs. The average values on Total Labour Force instead, shown that, even if conventional farms still have higher values than organic ones, the “distance” become shorter. That means that the two groups are quite similar and that, even if organic farms still produce a lower “economic value”, they better compensate productive factors, especially in terms of Labour Force. Regards to efficiency analysis, we found that organic <b>olive-growing</b> farms are more able in using their disposable resources (with reference to their own frontier), and the higher efficiency permits them to compensate the lower productivity with respect to the conventional farms. ...|$|E
