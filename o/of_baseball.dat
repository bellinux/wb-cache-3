5|$|Following {{the death}} <b>of</b> <b>Baseball</b> Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis in November 1944, John O. Gottlieb, {{a friend of}} Chandler's in the War Department, {{suggested}} Chandler as a successor. Baseball owners who had been afraid that their players would be made eligible for the draft during the war had decided that their new commissioner needed to have the skills and influence to represent baseball's interests in Washington, D. C. As a senator, Chandler had advocated on behalf <b>of</b> <b>baseball</b> during the war, endearing him to the owners. Furthermore, the commissioner's $50,000 annual salary—about five times that of a US senator at the time—proved a significant enticement, and Chandler agreed {{to be considered for}} the job.|$|E

5|$|American {{football}} leagues exist {{throughout the}} world, {{but the game}} has yet to achieve the international success and popularity <b>of</b> <b>baseball</b> and basketball.

5|$|As {{professional}} baseball became increasingly profitable, players frequently raised grievances against owners over issues {{of control and}} equitable income distribution. During the major leagues' early decades, players on various teams occasionally attempted strikes, which routinely failed when their jobs were sufficiently threatened. In general, the strict rules <b>of</b> <b>baseball</b> contracts and the reserve clause, which bound players to their teams even when their contracts had ended, tended to keep the players in check. Motivated by dislike for particularly stingy owner Charles Comiskey and gamblers' payoffs, real and promised, members of the Chicago White Sox conspired to throw the 1919 World Series. The Black Sox Scandal {{led to the formation}} of a new National Commission <b>of</b> <b>baseball</b> that drew the two major leagues closer together. The first major league baseball commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, was elected in 1920. That year also saw the founding of the Negro National League; the first significant Negro league, it would operate until 1931. For part of the 1920s, it was joined by the Eastern Colored League.|$|E

5|$|Henry Chadwick is {{generally}} {{credited with the}} invention of scorekeeping in baseball. Chadwick was also {{the inventor of the}} modern box score and the writer of the first rule book for the game <b>of</b> <b>baseball.</b> Since baseball statistics were initially a subject of interest to sportswriters, the role of the official scorer in Major League Baseball (MLB) {{in the early days of}} the sport was performed by newspaper writers. A judgment call that is required by the official scorer does not alter the outcome of a game, but these judgments impact the statistical records of the game. As the subjective scoring decisions which are used to calculate baseball statistics began to be used to determine the relative value <b>of</b> <b>baseball</b> players, MLB began to require approval from the league before a writer-scorer could be assigned to produce the scoring report for a game. By the 1970s, writers who were willing to score games for MLB were required to have attended 100 or more games per year in the prior three years and to be chosen by the local chapter chairman of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Qualified candidates for scoring were submitted to the leagues for approval.|$|E

As Nicolas was still in high school, the Yankees were fined $500 by Happy Chandler, the Commissioner <b>of</b> <b>Baseball.</b> Nicolas never reached the Majors. However, Krichell's recommendation of Casey Stengel for manager of the Yankees in 1948 was instrumental in their front office hiring him.|$|E
