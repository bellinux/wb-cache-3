40|$|In small industry, trellis {{craftsmen}} have {{variety of}} stages in production process of trellis. They had only manually equipment {{to create a}} profile of fence. By using this manual process, it tends to increase operation cost and variety of quality of trellis fence. UD Jaya Makmur is a representative of trellis craftsmen who use manual equipment to produce trellis fences and other bar fences. Based on the background {{and the needs of}} this small fences industry, the fence bender machine has been built through Student Creativity Programme (PKM-T) which held by DIKTI. The process starting with exploring the machine design, then the proposed design had been analysed. After final calculation, the construction of fence bender machine was started, including profiling technology and automation. As the result, Fence Bender Machine has specification: Electric Motor 2 <b>HP</b> (<b>Horse</b> <b>Power),</b> Gearbox 1 : 60, Steel as material holder and can bend plate with 5 mm thickness. The machine was equipped by Holder/Bend Tool for bending or profiling. By comparing with manual production process, the fence bender can produce higher quality of trellis fence and better efficiency, because the machine can produce more fences and lower production cost. The production capacity of the machine was 240 products/hour for elbow profiles and 120 products/hour for circular profiles...|$|R

5000|$|The {{commercial}} Hugon engine {{appeared in}} 1865, and in appearance much resembled the Lenoir engine, but with flame ignition and water spray injection into the cylinder {{to control the}} temperatures. It was manufactured in England by Fred B. Vallance at the Alicel Works, Bridge Street, Greenwich.

50|$|The {{need for}} more power comes from {{necessity}} and desire when driving in steep sand dunes. This has driven sandrail engine builders to add performance features to engines such as the stock (24 to 50 <b>horse</b> <b>power)</b> Volkswagen engine. These include: larger pistons, turbochargers, dual racing carburetors, fuel injection, and high performance cylinder heads. Some performance engines can run on premium unleaded gasoline. However, many high performance engines must use racing fuel or fuel additives. A high performance sandrail Volkswagen engine can produce well into the 170-200+ <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> range and as high as 700 <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> with methanol fuel.|$|R
