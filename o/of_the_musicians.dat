5|$|Following {{multiple}} {{changes in}} personnel {{after the release}} of Last Splash (1993), singer and songwriter Kim Deal was the only remaining constant member of the Breeders by 1996. The next year, she returned to the studio in an attempt to record a follow-up album, but her behavior—including drug use and demanding expectations—alienated many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>musicians</b> and engineers with whom she worked.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, THSRC {{sponsored}} the Taiwan Choral Music Center (TCMC) {{to organize the}} “Taiwan International A Cappella Festival,” which featured performances by musical groups at THSR stations.

5|$|KMFDM's {{music has}} since been a fusion of {{electronic}} and heavy metal, with occasional elements of dub, as well as orchestral samples and live horns. Many songs feature prominent backing vocals by female singers such as Dorona Alberti, Travis, and Cifarelli. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>musicians</b> who have played in the band are multi-instrumentalists, {{so there is a}} degree of versatility and freedom in the music.|$|E

5|$|The folk {{elements}} in the genre often reflect the ethnic background <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>musicians</b> {{as is the case}} for the Scandinavian folk music in Finntroll and Korpiklaani, the Baltic folk music in Metsatöll and Skyforger or the Middle Eastern background of Orphaned Land. However, some bands defy the geographical and ethnical background, like Ymyrgar, who hail from Tunisia but chose to focus on Norse mythology.|$|E
5|$|The genre {{has always}} had its {{greatest}} appeal for white males. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>musicians</b> involved were male, {{as was the case}} for most rock music of the time, Female singers were better represented in the progressive folk bands, who displayed a broader range of vocal styles than the progressive rock bands with whom they frequently toured and shared band members.|$|E
5|$|Although the sextet had {{declined}} after 1986, in 1990 {{they got together}} to record Zyryab, a groundbreaking Arabic flamenco/jazz album with jazz pianist Chick Corea and fellow virtuoso flamenco guitarist Manolo Sanlúcar. The album is named after Ziryab, an 8th–9th century Shiraz-born poet/musician at the Umayyad court in Córdoba, credited with introducing to Spain the Persian lute, which evolved into the Spanish guitar—and according to some, established flamenco itself. One track on the album, a tarantas, is dedicated to Sabicas. The album was critically well-received; Jazz Times praised the passion and rhythm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>musicians</b> featuring on the album.|$|E

5|$|At {{this time}} in the United States, McCarthyism was at its height, {{generating}} fear and suspicion of entertainment industry figures, academics, military figures, and government officials by accusing them of real or suggested links to communist activities. The TSO was required to submit to United States immigration authorities all the names of its musicians and other staff who would be accompanying the tour. The immigration department approved visas for all but seven musicians, suspecting them of communist activities. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>musicians</b> was later cleared, leaving six musicians who were denied entry.|$|E
5|$|Dmitri Shostakovich had {{intended}} the piece to be premièred by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra, {{but because of}} the siege, that group was evacuated from the city, as was the composer himself. The world première of the symphony was held on 5 March in Kuybyshev with the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra. The Leningrad première was performed by the surviving musicians of the Leningrad Radio Orchestra, supplemented with military performers. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>musicians</b> were suffering from starvation, which made rehearsing difficult: musicians frequently collapsed during rehearsals, and three died. The orchestra was able to play the symphony all the way through only once before the concert.|$|E
5|$|Following the explosion, the {{remaining}} gunmen {{opened fire on}} the dazed band members, who had all been knocked down into the field {{below the level of}} the road from the force of the blast. The order to shoot was given by the patrol's apparent leader, James McDowell, to eliminate witnesses to the bogus checkpoint and subsequent bombing. Three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>musicians</b> were killed: lead singer Fran O'Toole, trumpeter Brian McCoy, and guitarist Tony Geraghty.|$|E

5|$|The Motown Record Corporation in Detroit, Michigan became {{successful}} {{with a string}} of heavily pop-influenced soul records, which were palatable enough to white listeners so as to allow R and soul to crossover to mainstream audiences. An important center of soul music recording was Florence, Alabama, where the FAME Studios operated. Jimmy Hughes, Percy Sledge and Arthur Alexander recorded at Fame; later in the 1960s, Aretha Franklin would also record in the area. Fame Studios, often referred to as Muscle Shoals, after a town neighboring Florence, enjoyed a close relationship with Stax, and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>musicians</b> and producers who worked in Memphis also contributed to recordings done in Alabama.|$|E
5|$|Werber {{imposed a}} stern {{training}} regimen on Guard, Shane, and Reynolds, rehearsing them for {{six to eight}} hours a day for several months, sending them to prominent San Francisco vocal coach Judy Davis to help them learn to preserve their voices, and working on the group's carefully prepared but apparently spontaneous banter between songs. At the same time, the group was developing a varied and eclectic repertoire of calypso, folk, and foreign language songs, suggested by all three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>musicians</b> though usually arranged by Guard with some harmonies created by Reynolds.|$|E
5|$|Sessions for the {{proposed}} album took place at London's Abbey Road Studios, beginning on 2 February 1971. In addition to his own contribution as guitarist, Harrison enlisted some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>musicians</b> {{with whom he had}} recorded All Things Must Pass: Gary Wright, on keyboards; Derek and the Dominos drummer Jim Gordon; Voormann and Carl Radle (the latter another member of the Dominos), alternating on bass; and Badfinger's Pete Ham on second guitar and percussion. Another participant was Leon Russell, familiar to Phil Spector as a regular member of the Wrecking Crew during the mid 1960s. Recording continued at Abbey Road on 3 February, during which Lennon joined the proceedings, allegedly on piano.|$|E

5|$|The {{period from}} 1480 to 1482 has puzzled biographers; {{contradictory}} evidence exists suggesting either that Josquin {{was still in}} France, or {{was already in the}} service of the Sforza family, specifically with Ascanio Sforza, who had been banished from Milan and resided temporarily in Ferrara or Naples. Residence in Ferrara in the early 1480s could explain the Missa Hercules dux Ferrariae, composed for Ercole d'Este, but which stylistically does not fit with the usual date of 1503–4 when Josquin was known to be in Ferrara. Alternatively it has been suggested that Josquin spent some of that time in Hungary, based on a mid-16th-century Roman document describing the Hungarian court in those years, and including Josquin as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>musicians</b> present.|$|E

25|$|Stax Records {{created a}} classic 1960s soul music sound, much grittier and horn-based than Motown.

40|$|Cognition, <b>the</b> topic <b>of</b> this dissertation, is a music market arcade for Gallo Records {{that will}} act as a {{platform}} for aspiring South African <b>musicians.</b> <b>The</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>musician</b> and <b>the</b> status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>musician</b> in society varies from culture to culture. Thus the topic will explore the social implications music has on different cultures by addressing diversion in a social context. Music will therefore act as generator by merging culture and creating an awareness and common ground by acting as the universal medium. In doing so,the musician will indirectly compose a South African identity by means of public performance. Dissertation (MArch(Prof)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008. Architectureunrestricte...|$|R
