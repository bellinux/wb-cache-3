40|$|Four mirror {{coatings}} {{were designed}} for transporting 1064 nm light, and prepared under the same process parameters. The laser induced damage threshold (LIDT), electric field distribution, {{as well as the}} damage morphology of the prepared transport mirror coating was investigated. The results indicate that the SiO 2 <b>overcoat</b> <b>layer</b> and electric field distribution have a great impact on the LIDT and damage morphology of the transport mirror coating. A thicker SiO 2 <b>overcoat</b> <b>layer</b> can suppress the delamination damage morphology, and significantly increase the LIDT. For the designs with similar. SiO 2 <b>overcoat</b> <b>layer</b> thickness, the nano-absorbing defects can survive at higher laser fluence in the design with lower electric field intensity. In addition, the HfO 2 over SiO 2 interface has a better interfacial strength and less "invisible" nano-absorbing defects than the SiO 2 over HfO 2 interface, suggesting that improving the SiO 2 over HfO 2 interfacial quality will be an effective way to enhance the laser damage performance of the transport mirror coating.

The incident radiation was assumed to exhibit the spectral distribution characteristic of a black body at different temperatures or equivalently, having different peak wavelengths, with the energy level scaled to give a range of desired surface radiative heat fluxes. This approach allows a straightforward comparison of the thernal response of a surface to incident radiation having the energy predominantly in a characteristic wavelength band and a well-defined spectral distribution.

These methods {{can be used}} to accurately measure polarization rotation and ellipticity, the reflection and transmission coefficients, the wavelength dependence of birefringence, Kerr rotation and ellipticity; the dielectric tensor of magneto-optical (MO) media, as well as the optical constants and thickness of thin film stacks. A series of optical, magneto-optical and magnetic recording media have been studied. A variable angle, multi-wavelength ellipsometer, and a MO Kerr spectrometer were used for these measurements. A general-purpose computer program has been used to analyze the experimental data. The in-plane and vertical birefringence of polycarbonate plastic substrates of optical disks have been measured for wavelengths between 360 nm and 860 nm, which covers the full range of interest for blue {{as well as for the}} current red and infrared recording.

40|$|The AGR- 1 and AGR- 2 {{compacting}} process involved overcoating TRISO {{particles and}} compacting {{them in a}} steel die. The overcoating step {{is the process of}} applying matrix to the OPyC layer of TRISO particles in a rotating drum in order to build up an <b>overcoat</b> <b>layer</b> of desired thickness. The matrix used in overcoating is a mixture of natural graphite, synthetic graphite, and thermosetting resin in the ratio, by weight, of 64 : 16 : 20. A wet mixing process was used for AGR- 1 and AGR- 2, in that the graphites and resin were mixed in the presence of ethyl alcohol. The goal of the wet mixing process was to 'resinate' the graphite particles, or coat each individual graphite particle with a thin layer of resin. This matrix production process was similar to the German, Chinese, Japanese, and South African methods, which also use various amount of solvent during mixing. See Appendix 1 for information on these countries matrix production techniques. The resin used for AGR- 1 and AGR- 2 was provided by Hexion, specifically Hexion grade Durite SC 1008. Durite SC 1008 is a solvated (liquid) resole phenolic resin. A resole resin does not typically have a hardening agent added. The major constituent of SC 1008 is phenol, with minor amounts of formaldehyde. Durite SC 1008 is high viscosity, so additional ethyl alcohol was added during matrix production in order to reduce its viscosity and enhance graphite particle resination. The current compacting scale up plan departs from a wet mixing process. The matrix production method specified in the scale up plan is a co-grinding jet mill process where powdered phenolic resin and graphite are all fed into a jet mill at the same time. Because of the change in matrix production style, SC 1008 cannot be used in the jet milling process because it is a liquid. The jet milling/mixing process requires that a suite of solid or powdered resins be investigated. The synthetic graphite used in AGR- 1 and AGR- 2 was provided by SGL Carbon, grade KRB 2000. KRB 2000 is a graphitized petroleum coke. The availability of KRB 2000 is perhaps in question, so a replacement synthetic graphite may need to be identified.

This manuscript version is made available under the CC-BY-NC-ND 4. 0 license [URL] main quest {{for the implementation of}} direct SPME to complex matrices has been the development of matrix compatible coatings that provide sufficient sensitivity towards the target analytes. In this context, we present here a thorough evaluation of PDMS-overcoated fibers suitable for simultaneous extraction of different polarities analytes, while maintaining adequate matrix compatibility. For this, eleven analytes were selected, from various application classes (pesticides, industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals) and {{with a wide range of}} log P values (ranging from 1. 43 to 6). The model matrix chosen was commercial Concord grape juice, which is rich in pigments such as anthocyanins, and contains approximately 20 % of sugar (w/w). Two types of PDMS, as well as other intrinsic factors associated with the PDMS-overcoated fiber fabrication are studied. The evaluation showed that the PDMS-overcoated fibers considerably slowed down the coating fouling process during direct immersion in complex matrices of high sugar content. Longevity differences could be seen between the two types of PDMS tested, with a proprietary Sylgard (R) giving superior performance because of lesser amount of reactive groups and enhanced hydrophobicity. Conversely, the thickness of the outer layer did not seem to have a significant effect on the fiber lifetime. We also demonstrate that the uniformity of the <b>overcoated</b> PDMS <b>layer</b> is paramount to the achievement of reliable data and extended fiber lifetime. Employing the optimum overcoated fiber, limits of detection (LOD) in the range of 0. 2 - 1. 3 ng/g could be achieved.

However, the preparation of high-performance Fe&# 8211;N/C catalysts mostly involves a high-temperature pyrolysis step, which generates not only catalytically active Fe&# 8211;Nx sites, but also less active large iron-based particles. Herein, we report a general “silica-protective-layer-assisted” approach that can preferentially generate the catalytically active Fe&# 8211;Nx sites in Fe&# 8211;N/C catalysts while suppressing the formation of large Fe-based particles. The catalyst preparation consisted of an adsorption of iron porphyrin precursor on carbon nanotube (CNT), silica <b>layer</b> <b>overcoating,</b> high-temperature pyrolysis, and silica layer etching, which yielded CNTs coated with thin layer of porphyrinic carbon (CNT/PC) catalysts. Temperature-controlled in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy during the preparation of CNT/PC catalyst revealed the coordination of silica layer to stabilize the Fe&# 8211;N 4 sites. The CNT/PC catalyst contained higher density of active Fe&# 8211;Nx sites compared to the CNT/PC prepared without silica coating.

40|$|Assembling {{nanoparticles}} into secondary structures {{not only}} allows {{the combination of}} properties of individual nanoparticles, but also {{takes advantage of the}} interactions between neighboring nanoparticles which result in new properties that cannot be found in the individual constituents. Moreover, the formation of secondary structures from primary nanoparticles is able to effectively address many challenges that are currently limiting the direct use of colloidal nanoparticles in practical applications. Two general processes for assembling hydrophobic nanoparticles to colloidal clusters were developed in my thesis work. The first method is direct self-assembly of hydrophobic nanoparticles on host nanostructures containing high density surface thiol groups. Hydrophobic nanoparticles of various compositions and combinations can be directly assembled onto the host surface through the strong coordination interactions between metal cations and thiol groups. The resulting structures can be further conveniently <b>overcoated</b> with a <b>layer</b> of normal silica to stabilize the assemblies and render them highly dispersible in water for biomedical applications. As the entire fabrication process does not involve complicated surface modification procedures, the hydrophobic ligands on the nanoparticles are not disturbed significantly so that they retain their original properties such as highly efficient luminescence. Multilayer structures can be achieved by repeating the mercapto-silica coating and nanoparticle immobilization processes. Another universal strategy for direct assembly of hydrophobic nanopaticles is based on emulsion method. Nanoparticles confined in an oil droplet are self-assembled into spherical clusters upon evaporation of the low-boiling-point organic solvent. Hollow clusters can be formed when nanoparticles and polymers are confined together in the oil droplet. For the practical application of these clusters, I further developed a post-treatment method called protected calcination to achieve well-dispersed mesoporous cluster with clean surface. Due to the crystalline nature of the primary nanoparticles, they do not grow significantly during calcination, allowing the preservation of high surface area and formation of packing pores in the clusters. The pore sizes can be conveniently controlled by changing {{the size and shape of}} building blocks during assembly. The as-synthesized mesoporous colloidal nanocrystal clusters are ready applied in bioseparation and photo catalysis due to their unique properties, including clean surface, high specific surface area, narrow pore size distribution, adjustable pore size and great water dispersity. As an example, mesoporous TiO 2 clusters are applied in the enrichment of phosphopeptides in phosphoproteome analysis. The superior features of these mesoporous structures have been fully tested by effective enrichment of phosphopeptides from digests of standard phosphoproteins, complex protein mixtures, natural non-fat milk and human serum samples. Phosphorylated proteins also can be effectively adsorbed on these mesoporous clusters. Moreover, the different pore sizes, controlled by changing the size of building blocks, allow selective enrichment of phosphorylated proteins with various sizes based on size exclusion mechanism. It is expected that these self-assembly strategies and post-treatment methods provide the research community a highly versatile, configurable, and reproducible process to prepare various multifunctional structures, which may have wide technical applications from photonics, separation, detection, multimodal imaging, energy storage and transformation, and catalysis...|$|R
