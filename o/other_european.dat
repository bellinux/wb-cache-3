5|$|With {{the growing}} {{industrialization}} that accelerated during the 20th and 21st century, Italian society gradually moved from an agricultural base to an urban and industrial center. This change weakened traditional culture {{in many parts}} of society; a similar process occurred in <b>other</b> <b>European</b> countries, but unlike them, Italy had no major initiative to preserve traditional musics. Immigration from North Africa, Asia, and <b>other</b> <b>European</b> countries led to further diversification of Italian music. Traditional music came to exist only in small pockets, especially as part of dedicated campaigns to retain local musical identities.|$|E

5|$|Belgrade has an {{extensive}} public transport {{system based on}} buses (118 urban lines and more than 300 suburban lines), trams (12 lines), and trolleybuses (8 lines). It is run by GSP Beograd and SP Lasta, in cooperation with private companies on various bus routes. The BusPlus ticketing system based on contactless smart cards began operating in February 2012. Belgrade also has a S-train network, BG Voz, now run by the city government (previous commuter railway network, Beovoz, was abolished around 2013). The main railway station connects Belgrade with <b>other</b> <b>European</b> capitals and many towns in Serbia. Travel by coach is also popular, and the capital is well-served with daily connections to every town in Serbia and to many <b>other</b> <b>European</b> destinations through the central bus station.|$|E

5|$|Swiss {{citizens}} are universally required to {{buy health insurance}} from private insurance companies, which in turn are required to accept every applicant. While {{the cost of the}} system is among the highest, it compares well with <b>other</b> <b>European</b> countries in terms of health outcomes; patients who are citizens have been reported as being, in general, highly satisfied with it. In 2012, life expectancy at birth was 80.4 years for men and 84.7 years for women — the highest in the world. However, spending on health is particularly high at 11.4% of GDP (2010), on par with Germany and France (11.6%) and <b>other</b> <b>European</b> countries, but notably less than spending in the USA (17.6%). From 1990, a steady increase can be observed, reflecting the high costs of the services provided. With an ageing population and new healthcare technologies, health spending will likely continue to rise.|$|E

5|$|The Glass Spider Tour was {{the first}} Bowie tour to reach Austria, Italy, Spain, Ireland and Wales.

5|$|The Spanish Philippines, {{somewhat}} distant to the <b>other</b> <b>European</b> {{colonies in}} the region, was a commercial backwater which survived through large subsidies from New Spain. The only significant towns were Manila and Cavite, the latter hosting a powerful Spanish naval squadron. A Portuguese mercantile presence {{existed in the}} Indian port of Goa, which {{was a source of}} concern to the British as it represented a weak point in the defenses of British India. Portugal also controlled the Chinese port of Macau and a number of trading posts on the East African coast in Portuguese Mozambique. <b>Other</b> <b>European</b> nations, including Denmark and Sweden traded in the East Indies, as increasingly did American merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{eventually}} became popular in <b>other</b> <b>European</b> countries as well.
