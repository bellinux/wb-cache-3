5|$|Polyploidy {{appears to}} have {{enhanced}} the ability of flowering plants to survive the extinction, probably because the additional copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> such plants possessed, allowed them to more readily adapt to the rapidly changing environmental conditions that followed the impact.|$|E
5|$|A {{compound}} {{in the milk}} of the tammar wallaby called AGG01 {{has the potential to}} be a new and powerful antibiotic. AGG01 is a protein, and in laboratory tests has proven to be 100 times more effective than penicillin. It has killed over 99% of the pathogenic bacteria, (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative), that it was incubated with, including Salmonella, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus. It also killed one species of fungus. Subsequent analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> has led to the discovery of several cathelicidin peptides, which could also be used as antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|The extremophile Deinococcus radiodurans has a {{remarkable}} {{ability to survive}} DNA damage from ionizing radiation and other sources. At least two copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genome,</b> with random DNA breaks, can form DNA fragments through annealing. Partially overlapping fragments are then used for synthesis of homologous regions through a moving D-loop that can continue extension until they find complementary partner strands. In the final step there is crossover by means of RecA-dependent homologous recombination.|$|E

5|$|After DNA {{replication}} is complete, {{the cell}} must physically {{separate the two}} copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> and divide into two distinct membrane-bound cells. In prokaryotes(bacteria and archaea) this usually occurs via a relatively simple process called binary fission, in which each circular genome attaches to the cell membrane and is separated into the daughter cells as the membrane invaginates to split the cytoplasm into two membrane-bound portions. Binary fission is extremely fast compared to the rates of cell division in eukaryotes. Eukaryotic cell division is a more complex process known as the cell cycle; DNA replication occurs during a phase of this cycle known as S phase, whereas the process of segregating chromosomes and splitting the cytoplasm occurs during M phase.|$|E

5|$|Like all lifeforms, new {{strains of}} E. coli evolve through the natural {{biological}} processes of mutation, gene duplication, and horizontal gene transfer; in particular, 18% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> {{of the laboratory}} strain MG1655 was horizontally acquired since the divergence from Salmonella. E. coli K-12 and E. coli B strains are {{the most frequently used}} varieties for laboratory purposes. Some strains develop traits that can be harmful to a host animal. These virulent strains typically cause a bout of diarrhea that is often self-limiting in healthy adults but is frequently lethal to children in the developing world. More virulent strains, such as , cause serious illness or death in the elderly, the very young, or the immunocompromised.|$|E
5|$|Viral genomes are circular, {{as in the}} polyomaviruses, or linear, as in the adenoviruses. The type of {{nucleic acid}} is {{irrelevant}} to the shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genome.</b> Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented. For RNA viruses, each segment often codes for only one protein and they are usually found together in one capsid.

5|$|Crystal {{structures}} of proteins (which are irregular {{and hundreds of}} times larger than cholesterol) began to be solved in the late 1950s, beginning with the structure of sperm whale myoglobin by Sir John Cowdery Kendrew, for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Max Perutz in 1962. Since that success, 132055 X-ray crystal {{structures of}} proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules have been determined. For comparison, the nearest competing method in terms of structures analyzed is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which has resolved 11904 chemical structures. Moreover, crystallography can solve structures of arbitrarily large molecules, whereas solution-state NMR is restricted to relatively small ones (less than 70 kDa). X-ray crystallography is now used routinely by scientists to determine how a pharmaceutical drug interacts with its protein target and what changes might improve it. However, intrinsic membrane proteins remain challenging to crystallize because they require detergents or other means to solubilize them in isolation, and such detergents often interfere with crystallization. Such membrane proteins are a large component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genome,</b> and include many proteins of great physiological importance, such as ion channels and receptors. Helium cryogenics are used to prevent radiation damage in protein crystals.|$|E

5|$|DNA usually {{occurs as}} linear {{chromosomes}} in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. The set of chromosomes {{in a cell}} makes up its genome; the human genome has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes. The information carried by DNA is held in the sequence of pieces of DNA called genes. Transmission of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing. For example, in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then {{used to make a}} matching protein sequence in a process called translation, which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. In alternative fashion, a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication. The details of these functions are covered in other articles; here {{the focus is on the}} interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genome.</b>|$|E
25|$|Parametric {{methods to}} infer HGT use {{characteristics}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> sequence specific to particular species or clades, also called genomic signatures. If a fragment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> strongly deviates from the genomic signature, {{this is a}} sign of a potential horizontal transfer. For example, because bacterial GC content falls within a wide range (see Figure 2), GC content of a genome segment is a simple genomic signature. Commonly used genomic signatures include nucleotide composition, oligonucleotide frequencies, or structural features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genome.</b>|$|E

25|$|Gene {{sequence}} {{within the}} genome is conserved across the family {{due to a}} phenomenon known as transcriptional polarity (see Mononegavirales) in which genes closest to the 3’ end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> are transcribed in greater abundance than those towards the 5’ end.

When the RNA polymerase is paused, there is a chance that it will dissociate from the RNA genome. If it dissociates, it must reenter the genome at the leader sequence, rather than continuing to transcribe the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genome.</b> The result is that the further downstream genes are from the leader sequence, the less they will be transcribed by RNA polymerase.|$|E
