5|$|Contrary to {{the view}} here popularized by Cassius Dio, however, Nerva had in fact little choice with regard to his successor. Faced with a major crisis, he desperately needed the support <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> could restore his damaged reputation. The only {{candidate}} with sufficient military experience, consular ancestry, and connections was Trajan. Likewise, Edward Gibbon's assertion that Nerva hereby established a tradition of succession through adoption among the Five Good Emperors has found little support among modern historians.|$|E
5|$|In Armenia, the {{strategically}} important city of Theodosiopolis (Erzurum) surrendered in 609 or 610 to Ashtat Yeztayar, {{because of}} the persuasion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> claimed to be Theodosius, the eldest son and co-emperor of Maurice, who had supposedly fled {{to the protection of}} Khosrow. In 608, the Persians launched a raid into Anatolia that reached Chalcedon, across the Bosphorus from Constantinople. The Persian conquest was a gradual process; by the time of Heraclius' accession the Persians had conquered all Roman cities east of the Euphrates and in Armenia before moving on to Cappadocia, where their general Shahin took Caesarea. There, Phocas' son-in-law Priscus, who had encouraged Heraclius and his father to rebel, started a year-long siege to trap them inside the city.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with those}} trivial messages, gandingans {{were also used}} in more seriously matters when {{signaling}} to others of imminent danger. During martial law, gandingans were used to warn villagers of incoming Marcos’ soldiers. Every time the villagers received the signal, they would disappear leaving the soldiers aloof until the soldiers themselves brought in a translator who told them, the gandingan {{was responsible for the}} scurry. So they arrested the gandingan player. A similar story talks about a brother <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> stole someone’s carabao. In order to keep his brother from getting arrested, the brother set up a gandingan up in a tree and would clang it every time the police arrived to warn his brother to leave their house. But like Marcos’ soldiers, the police bought a translator and so they were finally able to arrest the theft for stealing and the brother on the gandingan for obstruction of justice.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, tengu {{came to be}} feared as the {{vigilant}} protectors {{of certain}} forests. In the 1764 collection of strange stories , a tale tells <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> wanders into a deep valley while gathering leaves, only to be faced with a sudden and ferocious hailstorm. A group of peasants later {{tell him that he}} was in the valley where the guhin live, and anyone who takes a single leaf from that place will surely die. In the , written in 1849, the author describes the customs of the wood-cutters of Mino Province, who used a sort of rice cake called kuhin-mochi to placate the tengu, who would otherwise perpetrate all sorts of mischief. In other provinces a special kind of fish called okoze was offered to the tengu by woodsmen and hunters, in exchange for a successful day's work. The people of Ishikawa Prefecture have until recently believed that the tengu loathe mackerel, and have used this fish as a charm against kidnappings and hauntings by the mischievous spirits.|$|E
5|$|Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) {{investigate}} the fatal shooting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>who</b> was apparently killed for a $1.49 pen. Lewis believes {{there must be}} more to the story, refusing to believe a pen is worth killing for. When they search suspect Mitchell Forman's (Sal S. Koussa) apartment, they find thousands of pens, many of which line the walls like bizarre decorations. Lewis later finds Forman at the police station, where he originally planned to turn himself in, but instead {{went up to the}} roof to commit suicide. Lewis lures Forman away from the ledge by enticing him with a beautiful golden pen, which belonged to Lewis' deceased grandmother. Forman is taken into custody. Later, Lewis still cannot believe someone would kill over a pen, but Gee (Yaphet Kotto) suggests it is no worse than killing over a car or woman. Lewis, determined not to develop such a strong attachment to a material item, gives his grandmother's pen to Felton (Daniel Baldwin).|$|E

Several PSNI officers were injured in the rioting and at least one shot was fired at police. In early November, the Independent Monitoring Commission released a report stating that the threat from the RIRA and other dissident republicans was at its most serious level since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{was born}} in Cortland, New York, to John Brooks Parker, a farmer, and Harriet F. Stratton. Both of his parents were well educated and {{encouraged}} his reading from an early age. At the age of 12 or 13, Parker watched his father serve as a juror and was so fascinated by the proceedings that he resolved to become a lawyer. However, he trained initially {{as a teacher and}} taught in Binghamton. There he became engaged to Mary Louise Schoonmaker, the daughter <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> owned property near his school. Parker married Schoonmaker in 1872 and became a clerk at Schoonmaker & Hardenburgh, a legal firm at which one of her relatives was the senior partner. He then enrolled at Albany Law School of Union University, New York. After graduating with an LL.B. degree in 1873, he practiced law in Kingston until 1878 as the senior partner of the firm Parker & Kenyon.|$|E
5|$|Plato, in his Laws, {{set forth}} rules that governed not the ideal state, which he {{described}} in The Republic, but what he felt might be obtainable in the real world. Included amongst them were some dealing with inheritance and heiresses. In general outline, they conformed to Athenian practice, with the daughter <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> died without male heirs becoming an epikleros. Plato gave rules governing who the husband of the epikleros might be, {{and said that the}} inherited plot might not be divided or added to another plot. The main departure from Athenian law came if there was no direct heir, and the inheritance go to collateral relations. In that case, Plato assigned the inheritance not to one person, but to a pair, one male and one female, and ordered that they must marry and provide an heir to the estate, much like the epikleros.|$|E

5|$|The Restless Spirit is a 1913 American silent short drama film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Allan Dwan, featuring J. Warren Kerrigan and Pauline Bush. The film is based on Thomas Gray's 1751 poem, Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, and tells the story <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> wishes to be a conqueror. The Dreamer heads out into the desert and is nursed back to health by the Desert Flower. A series of illusions follows which shows the futility of conquest when he cannot conquer his own community. He returns and eventually becomes respected by the community that once ridiculed him. The film makes use of numerous dissolves which were technically difficult to execute, and reportedly sent the cameraman to the hospital due to stress. The film may have been the last unbilled appearance by Lon Chaney, and was released on October 27, 1913 by Universal Film Manufacturing Company under the Victor label. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|To {{achieve that}} result, Varrick takes care {{to prevent the}} case from going to Florida, Alisandros' {{favorite}} battleground. It is much better for them to let jurisdiction be claimed by Chicago federal judge Harry Seawright, with whom Rogan Rothberg has some ties. A bonus from Varrick's {{point of view is}} the fact that the Chicago tort lawsuit was filed by such a minor and inexperienced firm as Finley & Figg; it is confidently assumed that Karros would make short work of them in court. The case is soon expedited on Seawright's docket with Finley & Figg's claim singled out of the tort claimants and Karros takes action to have Finley & Figg's eight death cases heard separately. The specific case singled out to serve as the test case is one in which Finley & Figg represents the widow <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> died after taking Krayoxx but he was also taking prior to his death a mixture of some ten other drugs, so that it is virtually impossible to pinpoint the effect of Krayoxx.|$|E
