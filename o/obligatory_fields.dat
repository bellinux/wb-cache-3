40|$|In {{order to}} be able to {{successfully}} perform the reporting to the EU a tool is developed, that supports the federal structure of the Federal Republic of Germany by decentralised usability. The remarkable features are the possibility to import data from existing applications and as an alternative the well structured user interface. The collected data sets can be proofed on completeness against the <b>obligatory</b> <b>fields</b> defined by the European Commission. A module is implemented that allows for synchronisation of the list of waste water treatment plants known by the Commission with the plants, that actually have to be reported according to article 15 (4). This module uses a phonetical resemblance algorithm to ease the assignment of mistyped plant name pairs. For the purpose of balancing, the reporting of nutrient loads is made possible. All program modules are written in Tcl/Tk. They are working generically (i. e., they are reusable without change of source code since they are configurable) my making use of a data dictionary (database framework for application configuration). The data collection tool is successfully used by the German federal states (basic input) and the Federal Environmental Agency (central data union and consolidation). (orig.)

40|$|Mosaics, in {{all their}} {{possible}} variants of form, material and location, can and must be recognised within the definition of Architectural Heritage. A further examination also reveals that mosaics are fully included within the definition of Cultural Heritage and, so, constitute part of the CH of a territorial area. In the absence of specific regulations, studies {{have been carried out}} in relation to source data and scheduling instruments at national and regional level with a view to devising a schedule model specifically for the mosaic, so that it is no longer regarded as an archaeological finding in its own right, but as a systematic element. These have been compared with other local situations, in Italy and abroad, which need unambiguous parameters for standardisation. These operations pass unavoidably through the identification of parameters, metadata, final users and methods through which the project could be developed in the future. Of no small importance is the diversified input of specific and inter-disciplinary skills, which are necessary for a correct cataloguing of resources; that means determining the <b>obligatory</b> <b>fields</b> and structuring the various headings, devising also appropriate key words. The cataloguing procedure is fundamental in the process for an effective cultural development of Piedmont's mosaic heritage. More precisely, it becomes an element in a structure for multi-level querying of the Territorial Information System, devised in particular for visualising data relating to files on interactive support, but also for a web-GIS configuration...|$|E
50|$|Many {{university}} {{departments in}} the modular pattern, by themselves or in co-operation with other departments, have initiated or worked out self-financing diploma and proficiency courses. The Department of Psychology, for instance, had instituted a professional inter-disciplinary M. Psy. (Master of Psychology) program in Human Resource Development and Management in the Ninth Plan period. This program is, however, not being offered at the moment because of the shortage of faculty. It is also proposed to rename the program, {{in view of the}} recommendation of the UGC, as Master in Human Resource Development and Management. The Department has implemented the concept of ‘Cafeteria choice’ courses/modules, credit courses in other departments and <b>obligatory</b> <b>field</b> studies in their Post-graduate program. The Regional Learning Resource and Documentation Centre, which was set up by the Department in the Ninth Plan period, is to be further strengthened in the Eleventh Plan period.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{official}} censuses for the Czech lands (then part of Austria-Hungary) {{in the years}} 1869-1910 recorded each person's [...] "language of communication" [...] ("obcovací řeč"). This used to be criticised by linguistic minorities as representing the language of a person's surroundings rather than his or her own. The Czechoslovak censuses (1921, 1930, 1950, 1961, 1980) did not register respondents' language but [...] "národnost" [...] (ethnicity) {{which was to be}} assessed primarily, but not exclusively, {{on the basis of the}} person's [...] "maternal tongue" [...] ("mateřská řeč"). The 1970 census as well as modern censuses (1990, 2001, 2011) register both [...] "ethnicity" [...] and [...] "maternal tongue" [...] (which was, for example in the 2001 census, defined as [...] "the language in which your mother or the persons having raised you spoke with you during your childhood"). The 2011 census form was the first to allow a person to claim two native languages. While certain options are habitually suggested in the form (in 2011: Czech, Slovak, Romani, Polish, German, sign language), the possibility [...] "Other" [...] can be chosen together with completing one's own specification. Unlike [...] "ethnicity", this is an <b>obligatory</b> <b>field</b> in the form.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Child {{abuse is}} often unrecognized at out-of-hours primary care (OOH-PC) services. The aim {{of our study}} was to {{evaluate}} the clinical outcome of the screening instrument SPUTOVAMO-R 2 for child abuse (checklist), followed by a structured approach (reporting code), at OOH-PC services. The reporting code with five steps should ensure consistent action {{in case of a}} suspicion. METHODS: All children attending one of the five participating OOH-PC services in the region of Utrecht, the Netherlands, in a year time, were included. The checklist is an <b>obligatory</b> <b>field</b> in the electronic patient file and was filled in for all children. In case of a positive checklist, the steps in the reporting code were followed. Additionally, the case was evaluated in a multidisciplinary team to determine the probability of child abuse. RESULTS: The checklist was filled in for 50671 children; 108 (0. 2  %) were positive. The multidisciplinary team diagnosed child abuse in 24 (22  %) of the 108 positive checklists, and no child abuse in 36 (33  %). Emotional neglect was the most frequent type of abuse diagnosed. For all abused children, care was implemented according to the protocol. The most frequent care given was a referral to the hospital (N[*]=[*] 7) or contact with child's own general practitioner (N[*]=[*] 6). CONCLUSION: A checklist followed by a reporting code guarantees consistent actions and care for children with a suspicion of child abuse. The percentage of positive checklists is lower than expected. Validity of the checklist should be assessed in a diagnostic study...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{diagnostic}} {{value of the}} screening instrument SPUTOVAMO-R 2 (checklist, 5 questions) for child abuse at Out-of-hours Primary Care locations (OPC), by comparing the test outcome with information from Child Protection Services (CPS). Secondary, to determine whether reducing {{the length of the}} checklist compromises diagnostic value. METHODS: All children (< 18 years) attending one of the participating OPCs in the region of Utrecht, the Netherlands, in a year time, were included. The checklist is an <b>obligatory</b> <b>field</b> in the electronic patient file. CPS provided data on all checklist positives and a sample of 5500 checklist negatives (dataset). The checklist outcome was compared with a report to CPS in 10 months follow up after the OPC visit. RESULTS: The checklist was filled in for 50671 children; 108 (0. 2 %) checklists were positive. Within the dataset, 61 children were reported to CPS, with emotional neglect as the most frequent type of abuse (32. 8 %). The positive predictive value (PPV) of the checklist for child abuse was 8. 3 (95 % CI 3. 9 - 15. 2). The negative predictive value (NPV) was 99. 1 (98. 8 - 99. 3), with 52 false negatives. When the length of the checklist was reduced to two questions closely related to the medical process (SPUTOVAMO-R 3), the PPV was 9. 1 (3. 7 - 17. 8) and the NPV 99. 1 (98. 7 - 99. 3). These two questions are on the injury in relation to the history, and the interaction between child and parents. CONCLUSIONS: The checklist SPUTOVAMO-R 2 has a low detection rate of child abuse within the OPC setting, and a high false positive rate. Therefore, we recommend to use the shortened checklist only as a tool to increase the awareness of child abuse and not as a diagnostic instrument...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of {{presented}} thesis {{is to identify}} tourism space of the students of Geography of Tourism and Tourism and Recreation at Polish universities and to determine the relation between this space and the demographic characteristics of respondents, their place of study (city, university), program of studies, {{as well as their}} place of origin and permanent residence. In order to achieve that objective three hypotheses were formulated: 1. 	Tourism space of surveyed students is diverse and highly dependent on the university, at which they study. This is influenced by geographic location of university and by programme of studies conducted there. 2. 	Places and regions known from <b>obligatory</b> <b>field</b> trips included in study programmes are more often visited by students during their tourist trips and better rated than other regions. 3. 	The perception of the city, in which respondents study depends on their place of origin and permanent residence. People who study in their hometown have lesser knowledge of its tourism space than incomers. The subject of this research were students of the last year of second degree studies (both full-time and part-time) of Geography of Tourism or Tourism and Recreation, conducted in 16 selected Polish universities: 9 classical universities, 3 universities of physical education (AWFs), 3 pedagogical universities and 1 university of economics. Those universities were located in 11 cities – Bydgoszcz, Kraków, Kielce, Lublin, Łódź, Poznań, Słupsk, Szczecin, Warszawa, Wrocław. Above-mentioned universities were deliberately chosen in order to determine whether there is a differentiation between various types of schools in terms of students’ tourism space and profiles of education. The main research methods were based on questionnaires and analysis of source materials (e. g. programmes of studies offered in surveyed universities). As a result it was found that, as for the models of tourism, among surveyed students of Geography of Tourism and Tourism and Recreation from various types of universities there were significant differences. Furthermore, study programmes were different, which resulted from, inter alia, the location of the studies in the organizational structure of universities, as well as from historical factors. Hence it can be stated that – despite conducting similar courses of study – various types of universities offer diverse approach to the field of tourism. The respondents were generally actively involved in tourism (both domestic and foreign). They organized their trips on their own, but in terms of reception places and form of tourism activities, their journeys did not go beyond the standard offers of travel agencies. The most active in terms of tourism were students from classical universities and university of economics, to a lesser extent – those from universities of physical education; the least active were respondents from pedagogical universities. Regarding the perception of tourism space of Poland, in students’ opinion the most attractive regions were: Baltic coast (especially Gdańsk Bay), lake districts (especially Masurian Lake Dirtrict) and in southern parts of the country: the Sudetes, the Cracow-Silesian Upland, the Tatras, Pieniny and Bieszczady Mountains. It was also found that certain regions of Poland can be defined as non-touristic in terms of students’s trips and their perception of tourism space, as they represent terra incognita of respondents’ tourism space. This problem affected in particular three provinces: Łódź, Masovian and Opole voivodeships. The results of empirical studies allowed to confirm hypotheses 1 st and 2 nd, regarding the differentiation of respondents’ tourism space and the factors of such differentiation. Hence it can be stated that the universities that conduct studies in the field of geography of tourism/tourism and recreation are the creators of their students’ tourism space, both direct (places of <b>obligatory</b> <b>field</b> trips) and non-direct – as they influence students’ perception of tourism space as well as their choices of tourist destinations. The third hypothesis can be confirmed only partially. Studies have shown that the perception of urban tourism space indeed depends on the place of origin. However, the relationship is opposite than assumed – people who study in their hometown have a better knowledge of its tourism space and have a better opinion about it than incomers...|$|R
