50|$|<b>Orvepitant</b> (GW823296) {{is a drug}} {{developed}} by GlaxoSmithKline which acts as a selective antagonist for the NK1 receptor. It was under development as a potential antidepressant drug, and early stage human clinical trials showed it to have some antidepressant effects, though not with sufficient efficacy to justify further development for this application. It was however considered a successful proof of concept for NK1 antagonists as potential antidepressants, and efforts are continuing to find more potent compounds which might be more effective.|$|E
5000|$|Encouraged by {{positive}} results {{in their early}} controlled studies of aprepitant (300 mg/d with enforced food intake) [...] and L-759,274(another NK1 receptor antagonist), {{as well as those}} of CP-122,721 (Pfizer) in patients with major depressive disorder, Merck & Co. conducted Phase III clinical trials on aprepitant in which patients received 80 mg or 160 mg/d (a new formulation, prescribed without enforced food intake) as a treatment for major depressive disorder. Despite achieving 90-95% receptor occupancy of aprepitant in certain brain regions, negative clinical results were observed in three actively controlled studies. The company has since abandoned plans to market aprepitant 160 mg as an antidepressant. Subsequently, large clinically positive double blind controlled studies with two additional NK1 receptor antagonists, casopitant, and <b>orvepitant</b> [...] (both GlaxoSmithKine compounds) have been published in peer reviewed medical journals. This work now replicates the early findings of Merck and Co with aprepitant and L-759,274, and of Pfizer with CP-122,721. Arguably, the weight of preclinical data and unambiguous positive clinical evidence (in over 2000 patients studied in five well-controlled RCTs, of five separate compounds tested at 2 or more dose levels conducted by three independent labs) provides critical evidence that NK1 receptor antagonism, including that of aprepitant, is an authentically distinct antidepressant mechanism. Across all these studies, efficacy appeared to be dose-related. Only mild, transient, and tolerable side effects, not those typically observed with either the SSRI, SNRI, or NRI classes of antidepressants, have been observed.|$|E
