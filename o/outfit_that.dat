25|$|As the cummerbund {{is seen as}} an {{extension}} of the trousers, traditionally it should the same colour, i.e. be black. However, the Black Tie Guide endorses deep and rich colours as a tasteful way to introduce some colour into an <b>outfit</b> <b>that</b> is otherwise monochromatic. Bright colours, such as those often worn by members of wedding parties, should be avoided and the bow tie must remain black in any case. Some higher quality models feature a hidden pocket and an elastic loop to fasten to the trousers.|$|E
25|$|The Albion Band {{survived by}} {{becoming}} involved in theatre productions and, from 1993 by shifting down to a small acoustic <b>outfit</b> <b>that</b> could play the still extensive network of folk clubs. This move was also significant in indicating {{the way in which}} electric folk personnel had become assimilated into the folk revival. It is notable that almost all the members of Fairport Convention have toured the folk club circuit solo or in smaller units and the line up at Cropredy includes as many acoustic acts as electric.|$|E

However, Ponting made a second ball duck in Australia's seven wicket defeat. They played Sri Lanka in their next match, this time at Trent Bridge in Nottingham. Ponting hit five boundaries on his 25 before he was bowled trying the run-rate, before Sri Lanka won by six wickets. The defeat consequently eliminated Australia from the tournament.|$|E

500|$|With the {{financial}} backing of several Jewish investors, {{including one of}} the owners, Abraham Bankier, Schindler signed an informal lease agreement on the factory on 13 November 1939 and formalised the arrangement on 15 January 1940. He renamed it Deutsche Emaillewaren-Fabrik (German Enamelware Factory) or DEF, and it soon became known by the nickname [...] "Emalia". He initially acquired a staff of seven Jewish workers (including Abraham Bankier, who helped him manage the company) and 250 non-Jewish Poles. At its peak in 1944, the business employed around 1,750 workers, a thousand of whom were Jews. Schindler also helped run Schlomo Wiener Ltd, a wholesale <b>outfit</b> <b>that</b> sold his enamelware, and was leaseholder of Prokosziner Glashütte, a glass factory.|$|E

500|$|A {{writer of}} MuchMusic called the album a [...] "work that is built to last", {{noting that the}} band {{produced}} [...] "something unique" [...] with [...] "depth and substance". Artistdirect agreed and explained that 30 Seconds to Mars established the group as [...] "fresh, new force", revealing a [...] "multi-faceted <b>outfit</b> <b>that</b> thrived on creative exploration and escape". Jon O'Brien, writing for AllMusic, labelled the album one of the [...] "more convincing actor-turned-rock star" [...] efforts. In a retrospective review in 2012, Ian Winwood from Kerrang! deemed the record an [...] "epic starting point" [...] for the music that followed, and stated that it displayed Jared Leto's [...] "vast, cinematic writing style". He considered its music [...] "undoubtedly the most aggressive they've created" [...] and regarded lead single [...] "Capricorn (A Brand New Name)" [...] as the band's [...] "most muscular moment".|$|E
500|$|The Paul Whiteman Orchestra was {{the most}} popular and highest paid band of the day. In spite of Whiteman's nickname, [...] "The King of Jazz", his was not a jazz ensemble, but a popular music <b>outfit</b> <b>that</b> played bits of jazz and {{classical}} music according to the demands of its record-buying and concert-going audience. Whiteman was perhaps best known for having premiered George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue in New York in 1924, and the orchestrator of that piece, Ferde Grofé, continued to be {{an important part of the}} band in 1928. At three hundred pounds, Whiteman was huge both physically and culturally—"a man flabby, virile, quick, coarse, untidy and sleek, with a hard core of shrewdness in an envelope of sentimentalism," [...] according to a 1926 New Yorker profile. And many Beiderbecke partisans have turned Whiteman into a villain in the years since.|$|E
500|$|In 1798, Drury Lane {{suspended}} its {{tradition of}} staging an annual Christmas pantomime, {{which meant that}} Grimaldi had to seek work elsewhere during the festive period. The following year, {{with the help of}} his father-in-law, he joined the company at Sadler's Wells, where he played roles in several Charles Dibdin plays. Grimaldi made a big impression, especially in Dibdin's Easter 1800 pantomime, Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World, based on Robert Paltock's 1751 novel. For this elaborate production, which featured two Clowns (Dubois and Grimaldi), Dibdin introduced new costume designs. Clown's costume was [...] "garishly colourful ... patterned with large diamonds and circles, and fringed with tassels and ruffs," [...] instead of the tatty servant's <b>outfit</b> <b>that</b> had been used for a century. The production was a hit, and the new costume design was copied by others in London. Despite Dubois' [...] "endless bag of tricks [...] vast array of skills", his performance appeared artificial, in contrast to Grimaldi, who was better able to [...] "draw the audience into believing the essential comedic qualities" [...] of Clown.|$|E
