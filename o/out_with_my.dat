500|$|The fourth song {{played and}} {{depicted}} in the program was Urban Rhapsody. Music played was George Gershwin's American classic Rhapsody in Blue. From the Coliseum's peristals, 85 grand pianos appeared. Followed by the orchestra and over 200 dancers. Followed immediately by The World Stage, a 1940s big band orchestra medley featuring songs mostly from Broadway, the movies and pop charts. Among the songs heard in this segment were Sing, Sing, Sing, Steppin' <b>Out</b> <b>With</b> <b>My</b> Baby from Easter Parade, One from A Chorus Line, the theme from Fame, and the Michael Jackson hit Beat It. [...] Joining the orchestra were 1500 dancers. The segment ends with the entire cast forming the outlined map of the United States to the strains of America the Beautiful.|$|E
500|$|Sorkin wrote 87 screenplays in all, which {{amounts to}} nearly every episode during the show's first four Emmy-winning seasons. Sorkin {{describes}} {{his role in}} the creative process as [...] "not so much [...] a showrunner or a producer. I'm really a writer." [...] He admits that this approach can have its drawbacks, saying [...] "Out of 88 [...] episodes that I did we were on time and on budget never, not once." [...] In 2003, {{at the end of the}} fourth season, Sorkin and fellow executive producer Thomas Schlamme left the show due to internal conflicts at Warner Bros. Television not involving the NBC network, thrusting producer John Wells into an expanded role as showrunner. Sorkin never watched any episodes beyond his writing tenure apart from 60 seconds of the fifth season's first episode, describing the experience as [...] "like watching somebody make <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> girlfriend." [...] Sorkin would later return in the series finale for a cameo appearance as a member of President Bartlet's staff.|$|E
500|$|... "Get On Top", a song which {{contains}} significant {{use of a}} wah pedal, was formed after a jam session conducted shortly after Frusciante had listened to Public Enemy: [...] "I came up with [...] {{on the way to}} rehearsal—just tapping it <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> foot." [...] The understated guitar solo played {{in the middle of the}} song was originally intended to be more noticeable, according to Frusciante, who was playing screaming guitar solos. He changed his thought process after listening to Steve Howe's guitar solo on Yes' [...] "Siberian Khatru": [...] "the band sounded really big—and they're playing really fast—and then this clean guitar solo comes out over on top. It's really beautiful, like it's on its own sort of shelf. For 'Get On Top' I wanted to play something that contrasted between the solo and the background." [...] "Savior", a song found towards the end of the album, features heavy effects, most notably an Electro-Harmonix Micro Synth with 16-second delay. Frusciante notes that the sound is [...] "directly inspired by Eric Clapton's playing in Cream. If you listen to the actual notes, they're like a Clapton solo—they just don't sound like it because of the effects." ...|$|E

On July 20, Aguilera held a 40-minute concert at Camden Palace Theatre in London, where she performed five songs from her then-upcoming album and two previous singles. On August 16, Aguilera held a release party for the album in New York City. Aguilera performed [...] "Hurt" [...] at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards on August 31. On September 8, she performed [...] "Candyman" [...] and [...] "Bennie and the Jets" [...] at the Fashion Rocks charity event, the latter was a duet with Elton John. Aguilera also sang [...] "Ain't No Other Man", [...] "Hurt" [...] and [...] "Steppin' <b>Out</b> <b>with</b> <b>My</b> Baby" [...] with Tony Bennett on Saturday Night Live on November 11, 2006. [...] "Hurt" [...] was also sung on the [...] "NBC Christmas Thanksgiving Special" [...] in November, and the German television series Wetten, dass..? in December of that year.

500|$|On the October 31, 2007 {{episode of}} the reality show Phenomenon, Paranormalist Jim Callahan {{performed}} a summoning, purportedly of author Raymond Hill, to help discover {{the contents of a}} locked box. [...] Although fellow judge Uri Geller praised the performance, Angel called it [...] "comical" [...] and subsequently challenged both Callahan and Geller to guess the contents of two envelopes he pulled out of his pocket, offering a million dollars of his own money to whoever could do so. This led to an argument between Callahan and Angel, during which Callahan walked toward Angel and called him an [...] "ideological bigot", with the two pulled apart as the show promptly went to a commercial break. Angel has since revealed the contents of one envelope and at the unveiling he challenged Geller one more time. Geller responded, [...] "Although we were born one day apart - I was born on the 20th of December and you on the 19th - a lot of years between us - 40 years, you were one year old when I came <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> spoon bending..." [...] Criss Angel cut him off at this point, saying, [...] "I guess this is a 'no,'" [...] and proceeded to open the envelope. The envelope contained an index card with the numbers [...] "911" [...] printed on it for September 11, 2001. Angel's explanation was this: [...] "If on 9-10 somebody could have predicted that 9-11 was going to happen, they could have saved thousands of lives". The other envelope's contents were scheduled to be revealed on the first episode of Season 4 of Criss Angel: Mindfreak.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Stephen Holden from The New York Times, Madonna explained {{the significance of the}} performance: [...] "Finally, right when you think I'll end [...] on a happy note, I come <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> family to do a Bob Fosse-meets-'Clockwork Orange' rendition of 'Keep It Together'. It's the show's ultimate statement about the family, because we're absolutely brutalizing with each other, while there's also no mistaking that we love each other deeply." [...] Author Lynne Layton complimented the performance, saying that [...] "as in her double attitude to materialism, femininity, and everything else, what marks the performance is not that Madonna is in control, but that she is open about {{the pros and cons of}} family life and obviously echoes the experience of many." [...] Her thoughts were shared by John LeLand from Newsday, who complimented the aerobics performed onstage by Madonna and her dancers. Conversely, author Allen Metz commented that although the performance was tightly choreographed, the overall feel was marred due to the song's own [...] "shortcomings". Greg Kot from Chicago Tribune felt that the addition of lines from [...] "Family Affair" [...] underlined the [...] "home-is-where-the-heart-is" [...] theme of [...] "Keep It Together". Louis Virtel from The Backlot praised the performance of the song, stating that it served as the [...] "perfect concluding performance." [...] Two different performances were recorded and released on video: the Blond Ambition – Japan Tour 90, filmed in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live, filmed in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990. It was also shown on the HBO special titled Madonna Live! – Blond Ambition World Tour, and was added in her 1991 documentary, [...]|$|E

2500|$|Although {{claiming}} [...] "we all {{helped put}} the album together", Q-Tip {{was the only}} Tribe Called Quest member present at every recording session.

I would have rather hung <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> boys on the street and got my hustle on rather than gone in the studio. I wasn’t even on the contract for the first album.

2500|$|Stories {{about the}} ghost {{soon began to}} circulate. Two women, one elderly and the other pregnant, were {{reported}} to have been seized by the ghost on separate occasions while walking near the churchyard; they were apparently so frightened they both died from shock a few days afterwards. A brewer's servant, Thomas Groom, later testified that, while walking through the churchyard with a companion one night, at close to 9:00pm, something rose from behind a tombstone and seized him by the throat. Hearing the scuffle, his companion turned around, at which the ghost [...] "gave me a twist round, and I saw nothing; I gave a bit of a push <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> fist, and felt something soft, like a great coat." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 1969 general election, the Alliance {{suffered}} substantial losses. The MCA, {{which was}} hardest hit, decided {{to withdraw from}} the government as they felt they were no longer representative of the Chinese community. Ismail was very critical of this decision, and attempted to persuade the MCA President, Tan Siew Sin, to change his mind. Ismail warned that [...] "this decision if not revoked would contribute to rioting and chaos in the country". On 13 May, after several controversial victory rallies were held by the victorious opposition, racial riots broke out in the federal capital, Kuala Lumpur. Ismail's daughter later said that her father [...] "remained calm, but took out his pistol, put it into his pocket, and went <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> mother to dinner".

[...] The clip fulfilled the intention of [...] "creating a world around her," [...] desiring to have an [...] "iconic" [...] aura. Kahn exclaimed [...] "the great thing about Janet is that her videos go all out, and that's risk-taking. She's not just doing what other people are doing, she's willing to go and try to create something new." [...] Jackson responded [...] "I enjoy trying different things, video wise as well as make-up and costuming, that's fun for me.
