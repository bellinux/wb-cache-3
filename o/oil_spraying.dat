Energy absorbent self-sealing fuel tanks are contained in the aircraft's sponsons, along with other equipment such as downward-facing illumination and navigation lighting fixtures. The transmission can accommodate more power than the maximum output of the engines; however two aircraft were lost in 2012 due to the cracking of the bevel gear shaft, a gearbox component. In response, the design of the transmission was modified in 2013, and the onboard health and usage monitoring system (HUMS) was upgraded to provide real-time monitoring of the bevel gear shaft against the threat of crack formation.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The {{influence}} of <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> {{on the field}} spread of the aphid-borne bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) in bean was studied in 1972 and 1973. <b>Oil</b> <b>sprays</b> failed to significantly reduce virus spread in the 1972 BYMV experiment. However, the data did suggest that {{the efficiency of the}} <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> could be greatly improved by timing the applications to periods of peak aphid activity. Several factors were identified which could have contributed to the failure of <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> to reduce the incidence of BYMV in 1972. An excessive time lag between bean emergence and the first oil application resulted in a considerable amount of virus spread within all of the plots before any <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> were applied. In addition, some of the treatments were subject to a disproportionate number of the dispersing aphid population which resulted in non-uniform virus spread throughout the study area. And all treatments were exposed for an excessive length of time to the gladioli or primary virus reservoir. As a result, the <b>oil</b> <b>sprayed</b> areas were subject to extreme pressure from the secondary and primary virus reservoirs. Results of the 1973 BYMV field experiment clearly indicate that <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> can protect bean plants against spread of BYMV under field conditions. A number of changes in the experimental design were responsible for the overall success of the 1973 experiment. The time lag between bean emergence and the first oil application was eliminated. This change prevented an excessive amount of virus spread early in the season, thus eliminating the high, non-differential virus spread that results when {{there is a lack of}} virus protection early in the season. And the exposure period of beans to the gladioli, primary virus source, was substantially reduced so that <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> were directed against the secondary virus source and not both primary and secondary virus sources. Harvest data collected during 1973 indicated that an increase in plant weight may not occur as a result of virus reduction by <b>oil</b> <b>sprays.</b> The data suggest that repeated applications of oil may bring about a physiological response resulting in an increase in plant weight unrelated to virus reduction...|$|R

50|$|The engine's {{displacement}} is 1,598 cc {{and it has}} a bore/stroke {{ratio of}} 79.7/80.1 mm, attaining cylinder pressures of 180 bar and a compression ratio of 16:1. It uses an aluminum engine block, die-cast aluminum bedplate, and am aluminum cylinder head. A chain-driven dual overhead camshaft with dual continuous variable cam phasing, employing weight-saving hollow sections and lobes, operates four valves per cylinder with low-friction, hydraulic roller finger followers. The pistons are made from aluminum for reduced reciprocating mass, feature a concave, shallow-bowl profile to facilitate efficient combustion, and are cooled by under-skirt <b>oil</b> <b>spraying.</b> The crankshaft employs four counterweights to minimize mass, and both it and the con-rods are made of forged steel. The engine features multiple improvements to reduce NVH, such as a cam cover made of GRP and fully decoupled from the engine to reduce noise and vibration, while also saving weight compared to aluminum; a composite intake manifold encapsulated in acoustic padding as well as an external plastic shield that both significantly reduce noise emissions; a mechanical crankshaft isolator which reduces radiated noise and torsional vibrations in the accessory drive system; and scissor gears for the timing drive system, incorporating tooth profiles ground with a Low Noise Shifting (LNS) process for optimal noise reduction. More than 150 patented diesel control functions are deployed by the engine's ECU, which was developed in-house by General Motors and jointly engineered in Italy (by GM Powertrain Torino), Germany, and the United States, and will be used in all future GM four-cylinder diesel engines.|$|E

40|$|In this {{follow-up}} study, {{we investigated}} effects of two rapeseed oil application rates (8 or 16 mL m- 2 d- 1) {{in combination with}} two spraying frequencies (daily or every other day) in four oil treatments: 8 mL m- 2 (24 h) - 1, 16 mL m- 2 (48 h) - 1, 16 mL m- 2 (24 h) - 1, and 32 mL m- 2 (48 h) - 1 during two growth cycles of broilers. Oil treatments {{were randomly assigned to}} four rooms, whereas two rooms served as control (0 mL m- 2). <b>Oil</b> <b>spraying</b> started on day 21. Prior to the second growth cycle, the spraying system was optimized to improve the distribution of oil and reduce the generation of small oil particles. We measured ventilation rate and concentrations of PM 10, PM 2. 5, ammonia, and odor. Furthermore, we recorded bird performance and birds' exterior quality. PM 10 emission was significantly reduced by 59 % at 8 mL m- 2 d- 1 and by 64 % at 16 mL m- 2 d- 1. For PM 2. 5, these values were 81 % and 74 %, respectively. In the two every other day treatments, PM 10 emission was 44 % higher on days after spraying than on spraying days. No significant effect of <b>oil</b> <b>spraying</b> was found on ammonia emission, odor emission, bird performance, and birds' exterior quality.

40|$|Purpose: In this study, a {{numerical}} simulation {{model of the}} <b>oil</b> <b>spraying</b> system is established. Design/methodology/approach: Spraying lubrication is a common form of the rolling bearing lubrication. Butwith the increase of the bearing speed, the roller cage is frequently shattered, which may lead to failure of thebearing. The shatter of roller cage {{may be related to}} the spraying mode of oil. For high-speed rolling bearing,the roller cage shatter can be cracked due to the shortage of oil, caused by lubricating oil not sprayed into theroller cage shatter. This condition can be ameliorated by changing the spraying mode of oil supply system. Themodel considered the spraying speed, spraying angle, oil pressure, oil viscosity, structure of roller cage shatter,rotating speed as the main parameters. By optimization, the best way of <b>oil</b> <b>spraying</b> was obtained which canmeet lubrication requirement of high-speed rolling bearing. At the same time, the numerical simulation resultsalso revealed that the optimal spraying mode is different for different rolling bearings. Findings: The simulating results indicate that due to the effect of the air pressure and airflow thickness, theoptimal spraying position is at a region closer to the inner ring of the bearings. Practical implications: This paper will provide useful information to applying numerical simulation of the oilspraying system.

The systems were evaluated using case-control approaches.

This paper presents {{the layout of the}} systems, compares their performance in practice with that under experimental conditions, discusses improvement possibilities, reports the baseline emission rates of the poultry houses, and discusses the validity of the case-control approaches. The emission reductions of PM 10 and PM 2. 5 were: 60 % and 53 % for the OSF in broilers (at 12 mL m − 2 d − 1), 21 % and 31 % for the OSF in laying hens (at 15 mL m − 2 d − 1), 32 % and 38 % for the OSV in laying hens (at 30 mL m − 2 d − 1), 49 % and 68 % for the NAI in broilers, and 6 % and zero for the PAI in laying hens.

40|$|Transportation {{sector is}} {{consuming}} {{a large portion}} of the total energy used by the humans. Today, most of the commercial vehicles are driven by internal combustion engines. Replacing them with electrical machine could have a large impact in the environment. But there is still room for improvement in the electric machines in order to replace the internal combustion engines. The electrical machines that are used in the automotive industry use permanent magnets in their rotors. They have a number of advantages such as very good efficiency and high power density. On the other hand, sensitivity of the magnets in high temperatures and their price is the major drawbacks of permanent magnet machines. The magnets cannot operate in high temperatures because they suffer from demagnetization. To deal with this problem, today, high temperature grade magnets with a lot of segments are used. In this thesis an <b>oil</b> <b>spraying</b> technique is used to cool the magnets in a safe operating temperature, increase their performance and also reducing their manufacturing cost. The analysis is based on theoretical calculations and experimental results from a test rig that was designed and constructed within the thesis. The oil-spraying cooling system, was designed to spray oil on the inside of the rotor of the electrical machine. Due to the high rotational speed the oil forms a thin film that absorbs the heat generated by the magnets. In the thesis a cylinder with an external heat source that simulated the actual rotor was used for evaluation. The actual losses of the magnets in an electrical machine was calculated for different operation points and segmentation of the magnets. Then the temperature of the magnets was calculated, by developing a thermal model, with and without <b>oil</b> <b>spraying.</b> The results showed significant drop in the temperature of the magnets as well as reduction in the number of segments...|$|E

Field trials were carried out in 2006 and 2007 growing seasons. Split - plot design was employed with four categories of chemical treatments and three varieties of pearl millet (SOSAT-C 88, EX-Borno and GB 8735). The treatments were in triplicates.

40|$|In {{alternative}} {{systems for}} laying hens, concentrations and emission rates of particulate matter (PM) give reason for concern {{with regard to}} working conditions, bird health and productivity, and health of residents living near farms. Previously, we found that spraying a film of rapeseed oil onto the litter of broilers could substantially reduce PM concentrations and emissions. The objective {{of this study was}} to establish dose-response effects of <b>oil</b> <b>spraying</b> in aviaries on concentrations and emission rates of PM with aerodynamic diameters less than 10 μm (PM 10) and 2. 5 μm (PM 2. 5), on stockmen's exposure to PM 10, on egg production, exterior quality and behavior of the hens, and on the litter. An experiment was carried out with 4 treatments: 0 (control), 15, 30, and 45 mL/m 2 per d (oil treatments). Each treatment was applied in 2 rooms with different aviary systems (8 rooms in total). The experiment was repeated during a second period, both lasting 35 days. From d 11 to d 35, oil was applied daily using a spraying gun. Applying 15, 30, or 45 mL/m 2 per d significantly reduced emission rates of PM 10 by 27, 62, and 82 %, and emission rates of PM 2. 5 by 71, 83, and 94 %, respectively. No significant effects of <b>oil</b> <b>spraying</b> were found on mortality, egg production, dust bathing behavior, scratching behavior, plumage soiling, DM content of the litter, or friability of the litter. A significant worsening of the plumage condition was found only for the body spot back/wings/tail (not for: throat/neck, chest/breast, or legs) in the 45 mL/m 2 per d treatment. Egg quality shifted significantly towards more second-class eggs in the oil treatments (1. 9 % versus 1. 4 %; P = 0. 004). Remarkably, foot soiling decreased with increasing oil application. In conclusion, PM concentrations and emission rates in aviaries can be effectively reduced by spraying 15 to 30 mL/m 2 per d with minor side effects within a 25 d application period...|$|E

The results indicate that this heat transfer process has the essential features of the thermal buoyancy jet flow. The jet flow is divided into the strong buoyancy, weak buoyancy and common buoyancy process according to Froude number of the jet flow.

Smaller Froude number indicates stronger buoyancy, weaker heat exchange strength and more obvious hierarchical distribution feature of the oil temperature inside the tank. Two indices (efficiency and uniformity) are introduced and examined which could be of practical usage. According to the simulated result, higher nozzle speed and proper spraying temperature which results in a lager Froude number can achieve better heating effect by taking two previous indices as evaluation criterion.

40|$|Air {{quality is}} known to affect the {{production}} efficacy, health and welfare of different livestock species, {{as well as the}} health of farm workers. It is therefore important to improve air quality in facilities housing livestock to reduce the incidence and severity of respiratory diseases, improve animal welfare, production efficiency and reduce the potential occupational health and safety risks arising from exposure of farm workers to airborne pollutants in livestock facilities. This paper outlines the development of test equipment that enabled the standardised testing of different oil application rates (to be applied in bedded livestock buildings) on the resulting levels of dust suppression. Specifically the development of the equipment enabled optimum stirring and rotational speeds to be determined to give consistent levels of dust generation within the test chamber. This allowed for different oil inclusion rates to be determined in the oil/water mixture to achieve optimal dust reduction rates. Results showed that increased amounts of oil water mixture resulted in a decrease of airborne dust particles from the bedding material. However, an economically optimum rate was also identified, when the diminishing return (in terms of dust reduction rate) on the amount of oil applied was also considered. The paper also reviewed some previous studies conducted in Australia aimed at fine-tuning and applying <b>oil</b> <b>spraying</b> in livestock buildings to suppress dust. ...|$|E

Different type of substrates {{were used for}} the moving mold; copper, low carbon steel, alumina coated steel, nickel coated steel, and zirconia coated steel. Interfacial heat fluxes between the solidifying strip and the moving mold substrate were calculated by the IHCP (Inverse Heat Conduction Problem) technique. The temperature history of the solidifying strip was calculated using the Enthalpy FVM (Finite Volume Method) associated with Scheil's model of solidification. The influence of thermophysical and morphological properties of mold substrates, wetting environment, casting speed, melt superheat, and grain refiner, on strip microstructures and their cooling rates, were thoroughly investigated. Maximum heat fluxes appeared about 0. 1 ~ 0. 2 seconds after the moment of thermal contact. For a copper substrate, these reached up to 7 MW/m 2, whereas those for a steel substrate were ~ 3 MW/m 2. The rate of heat transfer to coated substrates was significantly delayed and reduced because of the low thermal conductivity of coating layers. Maximum cooling rates of aluminum and magnesium strips reached about 200 °C/s on copper and about 150 °C/s on steel. It was found that the major thermal resistance resided in an interfacial layer separating the strip from the substrate. This interfacial layer presumably corresponded to the shrinkage of solidified skin or the entrainment of a thin air film resulting in numerous air pockets at the bottom surface of strips. <b>Oil</b> <b>spraying</b> onto the mold surface changed the interfacial wettability and dramatically improved the cast surface of the strips.

40|$|Animal {{houses are}} {{extremely}} dusty environments. Airborne particulate matter (PM) poses a health threat {{not only to}} the farmer and the animals, but, as a result of emissions from ventilation systems, also to residents living in livestock farming areas. In relation to this problem, the objectives of this thesis were threefold. The first objective was to increase our understanding and knowledge of concentrations and emission rates of PM in commonly applied animal housing systems. This objective is worked out in chapter 2 which presents a national emission survey into the concentrations and emissions of PM, which covered 13 common housing systems for poultry, pigs, and dairy in the Netherlands and included 202 24 -h measurements at 36 farms. The emission figures from this work are currently used in the Netherlands in environmental permit granting procedures (to model the local dispersion of PM 10 in the vicinity of livestock farms), to estimate national emissions, to compute large-scale pollutant concentration maps, and to annually evaluate the state of affairs of the National Air Quality Cooperation Programme (NSL). The second objective was to develop, test, and validate technologies to mitigate PM concentrations and emissions in poultry farms and ultimately contribute to cleaner outdoor air. This objective is worked out in chapters 3 through 7. Chapters 3 and 4 describe two experiments, one in broilers, one in layers, that investigated the effects of spraying rapeseed oil droplets onto the litter of poultry houses which prevents particles from the litter from becoming airborne. On the basis of chapters 3 and 4, chapter 5 describes a field evaluation of four systems that mitigate PM emissions by reducing indoor concentrations: a fixed <b>oil</b> <b>spraying</b> system, an autonomously driving <b>oil</b> <b>spraying</b> vehicle, a negative air ionization system, and a positive air ionization system. Chapter 6 describes a field evaluation of two ‘end of pipe’ systems to remove PM from the exhaust air of poultry farms, namely: a dry filter wall and an electrostatic precipitator. Chapter 7 describes an emission survey carried out at a total of 16 commercial poultry farms with an ‘end of pipe’ manure drying tunnel. This chapter aimed to elucidate the PM abatement potential and possible additional emissions of ammonia and odor of these tunnels. Furthermore, this chapter aimed to elucidate the perspective of two strategies to reduce any additional emissions from the manure drying tunnels. The results from chapters 5 through 7, carried out at commercial farms, have been used to adopt accurate PM removal figures in Dutch regulations on PM emissions from livestock houses. Finally, the third objective was to determine the applicability (in terms of acceptable accuracy and comparability) of alternative PM 10 measurement methods – i. e., alternative to the ‘cyclone sampler’ developed prior to this thesis and used in chapters 2 through 7. Such alternative samplers could then be applied in future for determination of PM 10 emission rates of animal houses. This objective has been worked out in chapter 8 as an equivalence study between the European reference sampler for PM 10 (described in EN 12341) and five different candidate measurement methods (the cyclone sampler, a beta-ray attenuation sampler, a microbalance device, and two light-scattering devices) in four different environments (a fattening pig house, a laying hen house, a broiler house, and an office room). Results show that all samplers showed a systematic deviation from ‘true’ values, that between-device variation was relatively high, and that samplers started to dysfunction after about 432 to 500 h of operation. Therefore, appropriate measures (such as duplicate sampling, correction factors, and more frequent servicing) must be taken. The results can be used to harmonize PM 10 measurement methods across institutes and to further increase the availability of samplers for the measurement of PM 10 in animal production...|$|E

Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo efficiency of Eucaliptus citriodora and Azadirachta indica oil on the control of Colletotrichum acutatum in strawberry. In the in vitro experiment, mycelial growth inhibition was determined when the fungus was subjected to extracts at the following concentrations: 0; 0. 25; 0. 5; 1. 0; and 1. 5 %. In the field, the disease control was evaluated through <b>oil</b> <b>spraying</b> at 0, 0. 5 and 1. 0 % concentrations at intervals of seven, fifteen and thirty days, in plants inoculated with 10 (6) conidia/mL suspension. Evaluations were weekly performed, and parameters such as occurrences and size of lesions in the peduncle and in the fruits, flower abortion, productivity, and natural disease occurrences were observed. In vitro, all treatments showed significant reduction in the mycelial growth relative to control. In the field, only neem oil had a significant effect decreasing flower abortion and the occurrences of sick fruits originated from inoculated flowers. However, natural disease occurrence was higher when 1. 0 % was weekly sprayed...|$|E

There is not much genetic material that is resistant to watermelon mosaic virus, however, some resistance has been identified in Cucumis sativus. Cultural practices such as crop rotation have also been found to be fairly effective methods of avoidance.|$|R
