5|$|Although Kennan {{regarded}} the Soviet Union as {{too weak to}} risk war, he nonetheless considered it an enemy capable of expanding into Western Europe through subversion, given the popular support for Communist parties in Western Europe, which remained demoralized by the devastation of the Second World War. To counter this potential source of Soviet influence, Kennan's solution was to direct economic aid and covert political help to Japan and Western Europe to revive Western governments and assist international capitalism; by doing so the United States would help to rebuild the balance of power. In June 1948, Kennan proposed covert assistance to left-wing parties not <b>oriented</b> <b>toward</b> Moscow and to labor unions in Western Europe in order to engineer a rift between Moscow and working-class movements in Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|As {{genres of}} popular literature, science fiction and fantasy often seem more {{constrained}} than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation {{and the effects}} that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre <b>oriented</b> <b>toward</b> a male readership. Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror, and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also provide more freedom than realistic literature to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that permeate many cultures. Homosexuality is now an accepted and common feature of science fiction and fantasy literature, its prevalence due {{to the influence of}} lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements.|$|E

30|$|For left turns (Fig. 3 b), {{notice how}} {{executing}} {{a left turn}} at the intersection results in mean heading of approximately −[*] 70 °. This is because the participant turned left in the intersection: more negative values indicate relatively leftward headings. During later trials, wayfinders showed a tendency to <b>orient</b> themselves <b>toward</b> more leftward (negative values) angles {{in the direction of}} the upcoming turn. This was reflected in a significant interaction between Trial Set and Time Bin, F(9, 279)[*]=[*] 8.37, p[*]<[*] 0.001, η 2 [*]<[*] 0.01. To test for differences between Trial Sets over time, we used simple effects ANOVAs to compare mean headings for trials 1 – 10 versus 11 – 20, in each of five 1 -s time bins preceding the intersection. The difference reached significance in time bins 1 (p[*]=[*] 0.023), 3 (p[*]=[*] 0.016), and 4 (p[*]=[*] 0.011). It did not reach significance in time bin 2 (p[*]=[*] 0.14) or in time bin 5 (p[*]=[*] 0.08). Thus, there was some evidence for <b>orienting</b> <b>toward</b> the direction of an upcoming left turn, particularly during later trials. If this pattern is indicative of knowledge development, it should also correlate with path efficiency gains during later trials. To examine this question, we calculated mean orientation difference scores comparing trials 11 – 20 versus 1 – 10 (for time bins 1 – 5) and mean path efficiency scores comparing trials 11 – 20 versus 1 – 10. In this manner, more negative mean orientation difference scores indicate a relative tendency to <b>orient</b> <b>toward</b> an upcoming left turn during later trials, and more positive path efficiency scores indicate higher path efficiency during later trials. Thus, a negative correlation would suggest that a relative tendency to <b>orient</b> <b>toward</b> an upcoming turn direction on later trials is related to relatively high path efficiency on those trials. This pattern was found, r(32)[*]=[*]− 0.42, p[*]=[*] 0.017.|$|R

40|$|Orientation {{is a key}} {{component}} to successful movements between habitats. We hypothesized that barren agricultural landscapes hinder the ability of frogs to orient and move between habitats. Specifically, we predicted that when presented with a choice between a short route through a hostile environment and a longer but safer route, individuals would select the one that entails the least risk. During a field experiment, we translocated 104 Edible Frogs (Rana klepton esculenta) into a recently harrowed field according to two treatments: the distance to their pond of origin (5 - 70 m) and the distance to a wooded hedgerow (10 - 60 m). The frogs' ability to <b>orient</b> <b>toward</b> the pond decreased with pond distance and increased with distance to the hedgerow, {{but we did not}} detect interactive effects.

40|$|Background: Anxiety {{disorders}} are highly prevalent {{in children and}} adolescents, and are associated with aberrant emotion-related attention orienting and inhibitory control. While recent studies conducted with high-trait anxious adults have employed novel emotion-modified antisaccade tasks to examine the influence of emotional information on orienting and inhibition, similar studies {{have yet to be}} conducted in youths. Methods: Participants were 22 children/adolescents diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and 22 age-matched healthy comparison youths. Participants completed an emotion-modified antisaccade task that was similar to those used in studies of high-trait anxious adults. This task probed the influence of abruptly appearing neutral, happy, angry, or fear stimuli on orienting (prosaccade) or inhibitory (antisaccade) responses. Results: Anxious compared to healthy children showed facilitated <b>orienting</b> <b>toward</b> angry stimuli. With respect to inhibitory processes, threat-related information improved antisaccade accuracy in healthy but not anxious youth. These findings were not linked to individual levels of reported anxiety or specific anxiety disorders. Conclusions: Findings suggest that anxious relative to healthy children manifest enhanced <b>orienting</b> <b>toward</b> threat-related stimuli.

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} {{the role of}} the dorsal midline structures, the notochord and notoplate, in patterning the cell motilities that underlie convergent extension of the Xenopus neural plate. In explants of deep neural plate with underlying dorsal mesoderm, lateral neural plate cells show a monopolar, medially directed protrusive activity. In contrast, neural plate explants lacking the underlying dorsal mesoderm show a bipolar, mediolaterally directed protrusive activity. Here, we report that “midlineless” explants consisting of the deep neural plate and underlying somitic mesoderm, but lacking a midline, show bipolar, mediolaterally oriented protrusive activity. Adding an ectopic midline to the lateral edge of these explants restores the monopolar protrusive activity over the entire extent of the midlineless explant. Monopolarized cells near the ectopic midline <b>orient</b> <b>toward</b> it, whereas those located near the original, removed midline <b>orient</b> <b>toward</b> this midline. This behavior can be explained by two signals emanating from the midline.

40|$|In a {{previous}} study, {{the pattern of}} ear superiority displayed by nonmusicians in a task where dichotically presented target melodies have to be recognized among four probes {{was found to be}} correlated with subjects' descriptions of their operating modes: those who reported focusing on critical local differences in pitch tended to show right ear advantage (REA) and the others LEA. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to examine if laterality patterns can be affected by treatments designed to induce particular strategies. Treatments supposed to <b>orient</b> <b>toward</b> analytic processing, advising attention to critical notes, with (Experiment 2) or without (Experiment 1) the additional task of reporting their location, produced the expected shift toward REA. To the contrary, treatments supposed to <b>orient</b> <b>toward</b> holistic processing, advising attention to overall contour or requesting aesthetic judgments (Experiment 1), failed to produce the expected shift toward LEA. The result can be attributed either to a basic difference in susceptibility to strategic control between the different operating modes or, more simply, to ineffectiveness of the present holistically oriented treatments. © 1987.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to examine {{behavioral}} and electrophysiological correlates of involuntary <b>orienting</b> <b>toward</b> rapidly presented angry faces in non-anxious, healthy adults using a dot-probe task in conjunction with high-density event-related potentials and a distributed source localization technique. Consistent with previous studies, participants showed hypervigilance toward angry faces, as indexed by facilitated response time for validly cued probes following angry faces and an enhanced P 1 component. An opposite pattern was found for happy faces suggesting that attention was directed toward the relatively more threatening stimuli within the visual field (neutral faces). Source localization of the P 1 effect for angry faces indicated increased activity within the anterior cingulate cortex, possibly reflecting conflict experienced during invalidly cued trials. No modulation of the early C 1 component was found for affect or spatial attention. Furthermore, the face-sensitive N 170 was not modulated by emotional expression. Results suggest that the earliest modulation of spatial attention by face stimuli is manifested in the P 1 component, and provide insights about mechanisms underlying attentional <b>orienting</b> <b>toward</b> cues of threat and social disapproval...|$|R
