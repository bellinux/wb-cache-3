5|$|In the 1970s, {{four other}} {{low-level}} buildings were built as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center complex. A seventh building {{was built in}} the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|The former Twin Towers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center {{were located}} in Lower Manhattan. At , the 110-story {{buildings}} were the world's tallest from 1972 until they were surpassed by {{the construction of the}} Willis Tower in 1974 (formerly known as the Sears Tower, located in Chicago). One World Trade Center, a replacement for the Twin Towers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center, is currently the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|The complex {{initially}} {{failed to}} attract the expected clientele. During the early years, various governmental organizations became key tenants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center, such as the State of New York. In the 1980s, the city's perilous financial condition eased, after which {{an increasing number of}} private companies—mostly financial firms related to Wall Street—became tenants. During the 1990s, approximately 500 companies had offices in the complex, including financial companies such as Morgan Stanley, Aon Corporation, and Salomon Brothers. The basement concourse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center included The Mall at the World Trade Center, and a PATH station. The North Tower became the main corporate headquarters of Cantor Fitzgerald, and it also became the headquarters of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|After the crash, the North Tower burned for 102minutes before {{collapsing}} at 10:28A.M.

In addition to the aircraft passengers and building occupants, hundreds of rescue workers also died when the tower collapsed.

5|$|The {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center, {{of which}} the Twin Towers (One and Two World Trade Center) were the centerpieces, was conceived as an urban renewal project and spearheaded by David Rockefeller. The project was intended to help revitalize Lower Manhattan. The project was planned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which hired architect Minoru Yamasaki. Yamasaki {{came up with the}} idea of building twin towers. After extensive negotiations, the New Jersey and New York State governments, which supervise the Port Authority, consented to the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center at the Radio Row site, located in the lower-west area of Manhattan. To satisfy the New Jersey government, the Port Authority agreed to buy the bankrupt Hudson & Manhattan Railroad (renamed to Port Authority Trans-Hudson), which transported commuters from New Jersey to Lower Manhattan.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center {{and nearby}} infrastructure caused serious {{damage to the}} economy of Lower Manhattan and {{had a significant effect}} on global markets, resulting in the closing of Wall Street until September 17 and the civilian airspace in the U.S. and Canada until September 13. Many closings, evacuations, and cancellations followed, out of respect or fear of further attacks. Cleanup <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center site was completed in May 2002, and the Pentagon was repaired within a year. On November 18, 2006, construction of One World Trade Center began at the World Trade Center site. The building was officially opened on November 3, 2014. Numerous memorials have been constructed, including the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York City, the Pentagon Memorial in Arlington County, Virginia, and the Flight 93 National Memorial in a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.|$|E
