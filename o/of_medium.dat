5|$|Fellow revolutionary Panayot Hitov later {{described}} the adult Levski as being <b>of</b> <b>medium</b> height and having an agile, wiry appearance—with light, greyish-blue eyes, blond hair, {{and a small}} moustache. He added that Levski abstained from smoking and drinking. Hitov's memories of Levski's appearance are supported by Levski's contemporaries, revolutionary and writer Lyuben Karavelov and teacher Ivan Furnadzhiev. The only differences are that Karavelov claimed Levski was tall rather than <b>of</b> <b>medium</b> height, while Furnadzhiev noted that his moustache was light brown and his eyes appeared hazel.|$|E

40|$|As a part {{of loyalty}} {{programs}} in marketing or as incentive plans in companies, mediums have attracted considerable interest from marketing and organizational behavior researchers. Previous studies focused mainly on the effects <b>of</b> <b>mediums</b> on people’s choices {{and not on the}} role of moderators <b>of</b> a <b>medium</b> effect. The goal of the present thesis is to study two such moderators namely the numerosity <b>of</b> a <b>medium</b> and the cognitive complexity <b>of</b> <b>mediums.</b> In this study, after a thorough theoretical analysis, experimental data is analyzed to explore the relation between numerosity and cognitive complexity <b>of</b> a <b>medium</b> on individuals’ efforts. Our findings suggest that the medium effect is stronger when a medium is more numerous. Also, a more cognitively complex medium makes the mediums more effective...|$|R
