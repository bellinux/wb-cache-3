500|$|... "Harlem Shake" [...] {{begins with}} a sample of a voice {{shouting}} [...] "con los terroristas", a Spanish phrase which translates to [...] "with the terrorists" [...] in English. Although listeners assumed it was a female voice, the sample was taken from the 2006 reggaeton song [...] "Maldades" [...] by Héctor Delgado, who often used the line as a refrain on his other songs. In 2010, the recorded phrase was used by Philadelphia disc jockeys Skinny Friedman and DJ Apt One on their remix of Gregor Salto's dance track [...] "Con Alegría". Baauer said he found the vocal sample from an unidentified source on the Internet. The sampled voice is followed by building synths and snares, and a syncopated sub-bass sound before another voice commands listeners to [...] "do the Harlem shake". The line was sampled from Plastic Little's 2001 hip hop song [...] "Miller Time", which Baauer sampled after having a friend play it for him and [...] " [...] stuck in my head for a while". Plastic Little member Jayson Musson said his line was inspired by a fist-fight that he ended by performing the harlem shake dance move: [...] "This was my first fight and I didn’t know how to properly 'end' a fight, so I just smiled at him and did the Harlem shake, blood gushing from glass cuts on my face. The <b>other</b> <b>kid,</b> I guess not wanting to fight anymore, or maybe not wanting to fight someone who just danced at him, got on his skateboard and took off without his shoes." ...|$|E
500|$|Portman and Kunis started {{training}} {{six months}} before the start of filming in order to attain a body type and muscle tone more similar to those of professional dancers. Portman worked out for five hours a day, doing ballet, cross-training, and swimming. A few months closer to filming, she began choreography training. Kunis engaged in cardio and Pilates, [...] "train seven days a week, five hours, for five, six months total, and ... was put on a very strict diet of 1,200 calories a day." [...] She lost 20 pounds from her normal weight of about 117 pounds, and reported that Portman [...] "became smaller than I did." [...] Kunis said, [...] "I did ballet as a kid like every <b>other</b> <b>kid</b> does ballet. You wear a tutu and you stand on stage and you look cute and twirl. But this is very different because you can't fake it. You can't just stay in there and like pretend you know what you're doing. Your whole body has to be structured differently." [...] Georgina Parkinson, a ballet mistress from the American Ballet Theatre (ABT), coached the actors in ballet. ABT soloists Sarah Lane and Maria Riccetto served as [...] "dance doubles" [...] for Portman and Kunis respectively. Dancer Kimberly Prosa also served as a double for Portman. She stated: [...] "Natalie took class, she studied for several months, from the waist up is her. Sarah Lane a soloist at ABT, did the heavy tricks, she did the fouettés, but they only had her for a limited time, a couple of weeks, so I did the rest of whatever dance shots they needed." ...|$|E

This causes Arjun to fight with the <b>other</b> <b>kids.</b> He gets bruised which saddens Anjali, but a special bond is born between the siblings. Arjun becomes protective of her and challenges the <b>other</b> <b>kids</b> in the colony to a fight if they can’t accept her. The kids accept Anjali and all the kids come to love her.|$|R

2500|$|The string {{orchestration}} for [...] "How to Disappear Completely" [...] {{was influenced}} by Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki. Jonny Greenwood's use of the ondes Martenot on this and several <b>other</b> <b>Kid</b> A songs was inspired by Olivier Messiaen, who popularised the early electronic instrument {{and was one of}} Greenwood's teenage heroes. [...] "Idioteque" [...] samples two computer music pieces, Paul Lansky's [...] "Mild Und Leise" [...] and Arthur Kreiger's [...] "Short Piece". Both samples were taken from Electronic Music Winners, a 1976 experimental music LP which Jonny Greenwood had stumbled upon while the band was working on Kid A. Thom Yorke also referred to electronic dance music when talking about [...] "Idioteque", and said that the song was [...] "an attempt to capture that exploding beat sound where you're at the club and the PA's so loud, you know it's doing damage".|$|E
2500|$|In her childhood, Jemison {{learned to}} make {{connections}} to science by studying nature. Once when a splinter infected her thumb as a little girl, Jemison's mother {{turned it into a}} learning experience. She ended up doing a whole project about pus. Jemison's parents were very supportive of her interest in science, while her teachers were not. [...] "In kindergarten, my teacher asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I told her a scientist," [...] Jemison says. [...] "She said, 'Don't you mean a nurse?' Now, there's nothing wrong with being a nurse, but that's not what I wanted to be." [...] In an interview with Makers, she further explains how her sheer interest in science was not accepted. [...] "Growing up...I was just like every <b>other</b> <b>kid.</b> I loved space, stars and dinosaurs. I always knew I wanted to explore. At the time of the Apollo airing, everybody was thrilled about space, but I remember being irritated that there were no women astronauts. People tried to explain that to me, and I did not buy it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{people were}} sceptical about mass citizen {{training}} in CPR; indeed, many felt {{the potential for}} harm was too great to allow such a procedure {{in the hands of}} laypersons. The skeptics also had the support of national medical organizations. The alarmist voices were stilled by some fortunate saves. Cobb recalled one resuscitation soon after the citizen training program began. [...] "In March 1973 there were these kids playing golf at Jackson Park. They came across a victim {{a quarter of a mile}} from the clubhouse." [...] The man was unconscious and not breathing; later it was confirmed that he was in ventricular fibrillation. [...] "But these kids had taken the [...] course over at the local high school. Two or three of them started doing CPR and the <b>other</b> <b>kid</b> ran off and phoned the fire department. Shortly they came with the aid car and Medic 1 screaming over the fairways." [...] Cobb concluded, [...] "They got him started up again. He survived; he's alive today [...] That was a very convincing story. I didn't mind it being written up in the Reader's Digest." ...|$|E

[...] "They had {{the same}} bumps, the same pimples, the same scratches; {{they were the same}} age to within three days; they weighed the same to an ounce; and they measured the same to an inch. One father was tall and fair, and the other was short and dark. The tall, fair man had a dark, short wife; and the short, dark man had married a tall, fair woman. For a week they changed those kids to and fro a dozen times a day, and cried and quarrelled over them. Each woman felt sure she was the mother of the one that was crowing at the moment, and when it yelled she was positive it was no child of hers. They thought they would trust to the instinct of the children. Neither child, so long as it wasn't hungry, appeared to care a curse for anybody; and when it was hungry it always wanted the mother that the <b>other</b> <b>kid</b> had got. They decided, in the end, to leave it to time. It's three years ago now, and possibly enough some likeness to the parents will develop that will settle the question. All I say is, up to three months old you can't tell 'em, I don't care who says you can." ...|$|E
