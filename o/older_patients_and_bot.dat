30|$|In general, {{males were}} less likely to get an {{antimicrobial}} prescription (OR =  0.86, 95  % CI 0.83 – 0.88), and older age did not increase the odds of an antimicrobial prescription.

When patients received a prescription for an antimicrobial, differences were observed in the chance of receiving a prescription for each antimicrobial separately.
