5|$|Biogeography has a {{long history}} in the natural {{sciences}} concerning the spatial distribution of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies. Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as migration and dispersal. and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth's biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called vicariance biogeography and it is a sub-discipline of biogeography. There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning ecological systems and processes. For example, the range and distribution of biodiversity and invasive species responding to climate change is a serious concern and active area <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of global warming.|$|E
5|$|Liquid crystal {{materials}} {{became a}} focus <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of flat panel electronic displays beginning in 1962 at RCA Laboratories. When physical chemist Richard Williams applied an electric field to {{a thin layer}} of a nematic liquid crystal at 125°C, he observed the formation of a regular pattern that he called domains (now known as Williams Domains). This led his colleague George H. Heilmeier to perform research on a liquid crystal-based flat panel display to replace the cathode ray vacuum tube used in televisions. But the para-Azoxyanisole that Williams and Heilmeier used exhibits the nematic liquid crystal state only above 116°C, which made it impractical to use in a commercial display product. A material that could be operated at room temperature was clearly needed.|$|E

Apparently, he had become so depressed that he drove to Baltimore to consult a psychiatrist, who put him in the clinic.|$|E
25|$|In bioinformatics, {{the basic}} method of {{information}} processing is to contrast the sequence data. It {{has a very}} important significance when biologists use it to discover the function, structure and evolutionary information in biological sequences. From the sequence assembly, the phylogenetic analysis, the haplotype comparison, and the prediction of RNA structure are all based on sequence alignment, so the efficiency of sequence alignment, especially multiple sequence alignment, will directly affect {{the effect of these}} problems’ solution. Therefore, to design a rational and efficient sequence alignment algorithm becomes a very important branch <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of bioinformatics.|$|E

The holotype is a complete and perfectly preserved skeleton of an adult specimen which was uncovered in September 1984 and which {{can be found at the}} Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt.

25|$|Pedophilia {{was first}} {{formally}} recognized and {{named in the}} late 19th century. A significant amount <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area has taken place since the 1980s. Although mostly documented in men, there are also women who exhibit the disorder, and researchers assume available estimates underrepresent the true number of female pedophiles. No cure for pedophilia has been developed, but there are therapies that can {{reduce the incidence of}} a person committing child sexual abuse. The exact causes of pedophilia have not been conclusively established. Some studies of pedophilia in child sex offenders have correlated it with various neurological abnormalities and psychological pathologies. In the United States, following Kansas v. Hendricks, sex offenders who are diagnosed with certain mental disorders, particularly pedophilia, can be subject to indefinite civil commitment.|$|E
25|$|The University of Tübingen {{undertakes}} a {{broad range}} of research projects in various fields. Among the more prominent ones in the natural sciences are the Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research, which focuses on general, cognitive and cellular neurology as well as neurodegeneration, and the Centre for Interdisciplinary Clinical Research, which deals primarily with cell biology in diagnostics and therapy of organ system diseases. In the liberal arts, the University of Tübingen is noteworthy for having the only faculty of rhetoric in Germany – the department was founded by Walter Jens, an important intellectual and literary critic. The university also boasts continued pre-eminence in its centuries-old traditions <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fields of philosophy, theology and philology. Since at least the nineteenth century, Tübingen has been the home of world-class research in prehistoric studies and the study of antiquity, including the study of the ancient Near East; a particular focus of the research in these areas at the University of Tübingen has been Anatolia, e.g., through the continued excavations of the university at Troy.|$|E
