5|$|The {{anniversary of}} the Restoration (which was also Charles's birthday)—29 May—was {{recognised}} in England until the mid-nineteenth century as <b>Oak</b> <b>Apple</b> Day, after the Royal Oak in which Charles hid during his escape from the forces of Oliver Cromwell. Traditional celebrations involved the wearing of oak leaves but these have now died out. Charles II is commemorated by statues in London's Soho Square, in Edinburgh's Parliament Square, in St Mary's Square in Gloucester, and near the south portal of Lichfield Cathedral, and is depicted extensively in literature and other media. Charleston, South Carolina, and South Kingstown, Rhode Island, are named after him.|$|E
5|$|The {{engravings}} are mirror {{images of}} the paintings (since the engraved plates are copied from the paintings the image is reversed when printed), which leads to problems ascertaining the times shown on the clocks {{in some of the}} scenes. The images are sometimes seen as parodies of middle class life in London at the time, but the moral judgements are not as harsh as in some of Hogarth's other works and the lower classes do not escape ridicule either. Often the theme is one of over-orderliness versus chaos. The four plates depict four times of day, but they also move through the seasons: Morning is set in winter, Noon in spring, and Evening in summer. However, Night—sometimes misidentified as being in September—takes place on <b>Oak</b> <b>Apple</b> Day in May rather than in the autumn.|$|E

5|$|There are {{numerous}} other symbols and symbolic artefacts, both official and unofficial, including the Tudor rose, the nation's floral emblem, and the Three Lions {{featured on the}} Royal Arms of England. The Tudor rose was adopted as a national emblem of England {{around the time of}} the Wars of the Roses as a symbol of peace. It is a syncretic symbol in that it merged the white rose of the Yorkists and the red rose of the Lancastrians—cadet branches of the Plantagenets who went to war over control of the nation. It is also known as the Rose of England. The oak tree is a symbol of England, representing strength and endurance. The Royal Oak symbol and <b>Oak</b> <b>Apple</b> Day commemorate the escape of King Charles II from the grasp of the parliamentarians after his father's execution: he hid in an oak tree to avoid detection before safely reaching exile.|$|E
25|$|The gall growth first {{appears as}} a rounded mass of green plant tissue on the leaf buds of the oak, later {{becoming}} hard and brown, being up to approximately 25mm / 1 inch in diameter. Although nearly spherical, the galls often {{have a number of}} little flattened nodules. The rounded growths are filled with a spongy mass and a single wasp larva is located in a hard seed-like cell in the centre. The word 'marble' derives from the gall's shape, which is a marble-like rounded structure. As stated, although normally distinctive the oak marble gall can, under some growth conditions, be mistaken for the <b>oak</b> <b>apple</b> gall, caused by a number of gall wasps, such as Biorhiza pallida. This {{may be due to the}} observer's unfamiliarity with the true <b>oak</b> <b>apple</b> gall which grows to be somewhat larger, has red markings, but does grow on the axillary or terminal buds. The galls sometimes coalesce. The non-parasitised specimens are at the largest end of the size range.|$|E
25|$|Oak marble galls {{develop as}} a {{chemically}} induced distortion of leaf buds on pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), sessile oak (Quercus petraea) or their hybrid Quercus × rosacea, trees, {{caused by the}} parthenogenetic gall wasp (Andricus kollari, (Hartig, 1843)) which lays eggs within leaf buds using their ovipositor. The Turkey oak (Quercus cerris), introduced into Britain in 1735, {{is required for the}} completion of the life cycle of the gall. The oak marble gall is frequently confused with the <b>oak</b> <b>apple</b> gall, caused by another gall wasp, Biorhiza pallida. Oak marble galls are also known as the bullet gall, oak nut or Devonshire gall. Synonyms for the species are Cynips kollari, Andricus quercusgemmae, A. minor, A. indigenus and A. circulans.|$|E

500|$|Traditional {{scholarship}} has {{held that the}} night is May 29, <b>Oak</b> <b>Apple</b> Day, a public holiday which celebrated the Restoration of the monarchy (demonstrated by the oak boughs above the barber's sign and {{on some of the}} subjects' hats, which recall the royal oak tree in which Charles II hid after losing the Battle of Worcester in 1651). [...] Alternatively, Sean Shesgreen has suggested that the date is September 3, commemorating the battle of Worcester itself, a dating that preserves the seasonal progression from winter to spring to summer to autumn.|$|E
2500|$|Apples {{appear in}} many {{religious}} traditions, {{often as a}} mystical or forbidden fruit. One of the problems identifying apples in religion, mythology and folktales is that {{as late as the}} 17th century, the word [...] "apple" [...] was used as a generic term for all (foreign) fruit other than berries, but including nuts. This term may even have extended to plant galls, as they were thought to be of plant origin (see <b>oak</b> <b>apple).</b> [...] For instance, when tomatoes were introduced into Europe, they were called [...] "love apples". [...] In one Old English work, cucumbers are called eorþæppla (lit. [...] "earth-apples'), just as in French, Dutch, Hebrew, Persian [...] and Swiss German as well as several other German dialects, the words for potatoes mean [...] "earth-apples" [...] in English. [...] In some languages, oranges are called [...] "golden apples" [...] or [...] "Chinese apples". Datura is called 'thorn-apple".|$|E
2500|$|Both {{the upper}} {{southwest}} and northeast sideslopes of Bennett Valley have significant oak woodland. [...] Both forested areas have dominant trees that include coast live oak. [...] On the lower slopes and northern valley floor there are considerable numbers of valley oak in relict stands, {{from a previous}} dominant cover of these lower elevations prior to agricultural development of the valley floor. According to the 1990 report of Earth Metrics, {{a large percentage of}} valley oaks near Bennett Valley Road at the northwest end of Bennett Valley were infested with <b>oak</b> <b>apple</b> gall. [...] Gall wasps of the family Cynipidae produce a single sexual generation within a structure that resembles an apple. [...] Some valley oaks on the site are infested with these [...] "fruits," [...] and on first glance appear as apple trees. [...] This infestation is considered mild, and should not affect the oaks' ability to survive. [...] Some valley oaks in this area were also noticeably infested with dwarf mistletoe in the 1990 survey. [...] This facultative epiphytic parasite can lead to the detriment of oak trees if allowed to persist and spread among trees ...|$|E

50|$|Gallic acid is an {{important}} component of iron gall ink, the standard European writing and drawing ink from the 12th to 19th centuries, with a history extending to the Roman empire and the Dead Sea Scrolls. Pliny the Elder (23-79 AD) describes his experiments with it and writes that it was used to produce dyes. Galls (also known as <b>oak</b> <b>apples)</b> from <b>oak</b> trees were crushed and mixed with water, producing tannic acid. It could then be mixed with green vitriol (ferrous sulfate) — obtained by allowing sulfate-saturated water from a spring or mine drainage to evaporate — and gum arabic from acacia trees; this combination of ingredients produced the ink.|$|R

The Venetian window in this room is derived from the Queen's Chapel at St James's Palace and was much imitated. The chimneypieces and surrounds again derive from Jonesian sources, in this case from the Queen's House, Greenwich. These marble chimneypieces have the inclusion of roses, Scottish thistles, grapes, sunflowers, <b>oak</b> <b>apples,</b> Pomegranates and fleur-de-lys which may be interpreted as Jacobite symbols.|$|R
5000|$|Traditional {{celebrations}} {{to commemorate}} the event often entailed the wearing of <b>oak</b> <b>apples</b> (a type of plant gall, possibly known {{in some parts of}} the country as a [...] "shick-shack") or sprigs of oak leaves, in reference to the occasion after the Battle of Worcester in September 1651, when Charles II escaped the Roundhead army by hiding in an oak tree near Boscobel House. Anyone who failed to wear a sprig of oak risked being pelted with bird's eggs or thrashed with nettles. In Sussex, those not wearing oak were liable to be pinched, giving rise to the unofficial name of [...] "Pinch- Day"; similarly it was known as [...] "Bumping Day" [...] in Essex.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Oak</b> <b>apple</b> or oak gall is {{the common}} name for a large, round, vaguely apple-like gall {{commonly}} found on many species of oak. Oak apples {{range in size from}} 2 to 4 cm in diameter and are caused by chemicals injected by the larva of certain kinds of gall wasp in the family Cynipidae. [...] The adult female wasp lays single eggs in developing leaf buds. The wasp larvae feed on the gall tissue resulting from their secretions. Considerable confusion exists in the general [...] "literature" [...] between the <b>oak</b> <b>apple</b> and the oak marble gall. The oak marble is frequently called the <b>oak</b> <b>apple</b> due to the superficial resemblance and the preponderance of the oak marble gall in the wild. Other galls found on oak trees include the oak artichoke gall and the acorn cup gall, but each of these has its own distinctive form.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on a {{wide range}} of plants. In eastern North America they can become pests on {{vegetable}} crops and in some fruit trees, damaging buds and new growth. Recorded food plants include white spruce, walnut, hickories, <b>oak,</b> strawberry, <b>apple,</b> cherry, plum, peach, potato and tomato.|$|R

50|$|The legally {{required}} {{method of}} cleaning and preparing klaf has been altered over the centuries. During Talmudic times, salt-water and barley (or flours) were sprinkled on the skins {{which were then}} soaked in the juice of afatsim (gall nuts, or <b>Oak</b> <b>apples).</b> Nowadays, most processors dip the skins in clear water for two days, and then soak them in limewater for nine days to remove the hair. When it is a hairless surface, the scribe stretches it on a wooden drying frame and scrapes it until it is dry. Creases are ironed out with presses. Then it is sanded until it becomes a flat, smooth sheet fit for writing. The reasons for the change in this process are lengthy and controversial. Today, a few Jewish scribes still prepare klaf in precise accordance with the Jewish Law.|$|R
