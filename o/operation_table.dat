This does not auger well with Ratna Devi's mother-in-law (Kannamba) and sister-in-law (M. Saroja) who make her life miserable, eventually forcing Anand to stop. Shortly thereafter Anand gets married to a nurse, Maya (Honey Irani) who is a spendthrift, does not get along with Anand, and he finds out that she cannot conceive. Eventually, Anand's dad passes away, he leaves considerable wealth to Anand's child, including a monthly allowance of Rs.10,000/-. At that time Maya comes to know the birth secret of Anand's child. So she plots a case in the court and wins. Therefore, Ratna Devi has to forcibly hand over the child to Maya but the depressed child not able to stay with Maya so he runs away from home, everybody is in search of the child in that bedlam Maya dies in an accident. Finally, Anand gives back the child to Ratna Devi and gets back to official duty dedicating his life to the hospital.|$|E
5000|$|During <b>Operation</b> <b>Table</b> Tennis, the 40th airdropped {{troops on}} the island of Noemfoor during July 1944. In November, the Squadron airdropped {{supplies}} to American {{troops on the}} island of Leyte in the Philippines. In January 1945, the Squadron transferred to Leyte. From there it made covert airdrops to Filipino guerrillas and commandos operating throughout the island chain. The Squadron's last major action of World War II came on 16 February with the invasion of Luzon. The 317th Group was tasked with dropping the 503rd Paratroopers onto Corregidor. The only suitable drop zones were an old American parade ground and a golf course. At precisely 0830, fifty-one C-47s began wheeling over the two small drop zones in counter-rotating orbits dropping eight men per pass. With Colonel Jack Lackey, the 317th Group Commander in the lead aircraft, the 39th and 40th Squadrons dropped on the former golf course while the 41st and 46th Squadrons racetracked to drop on the parade ground. While most of the aircraft were hit by intense ground fire, none were lost. For its efforts in this assault, the Squadron won its second Distinguished Unit Citation. The Squadron also participated in the airdrop of the 11th Airborne Division on Mindaro Island, and the airdrop of the 511th Paratroop Infantry on Los Banos, on the Batanga Peninsula of Luzon. February 1945, the Squadron carried the [...] "most valuable cargo ever moved in the Southwest Pacific Theater." [...] It brought 120 doctors and nurses to Mabalacat to care for American prisoners liberated from Japanese prisoner of war camps after three years of imprisonment. In March, the Squadron moved to Clark Field, Philippines. While at Clark, the Squadron dealt with raids by fanatical Japanese who penetrated the security around Clark to make hit and run attacks against the barracks and flight line. On 15 April, the Squadron launched a short but distinguished career as a strategic bombing squadron. Japanese troops holed up on Carabao island were threatening Allied shipping. Conventional bombing failed to make an impact, so the 40th's C-47s were loaded with 55 gallon drums filled with napalm. These were rolled out of the cargo doors and were credited with killing 2700 Japanese.|$|E

40|$|This study, is {{a result}} of a {{collaboration}} between Uddevalla hospital, Västra Götalandsregionen, and Chalmers University of Technology. The purpose of the study is to designing a new materials supply process of surgical material for the operation clinic at Uddevalla hospital which enables for decreased changeover time between surgeries. The study is conducted at Uddevalla hospital, a hospital which provides elective patient care. The flow of surgical material towards the part of the operation clinic that performs hip surgery is investigated. In order to map out the flow of surgical material towards the operation clinic, the project team follows the material from contamination during surgery, to it being back in the operation clinic storage, sterilised and packed. Data is collected through literature search, and a combination of structured observations and semi-structured interviews at Uddevalla hospital, NÄL hospital, and Mölndal hospital. During the data collection and the description of the current situation at Uddevalla hospital, it is made clear that material handling activities take place at the operation clinic which could be performed elsewhere by other personnel. Further, handling of separate disposable articles is identified as time consuming, and the <b>operation</b> <b>table</b> setting is appointed as the activity that effect the changeover time the most. A new materials supply process is suggested in which the activities operation cart packing and disinfection are externalised from the changeover process at the operation clinic to the central sterilisation department. Further, the project team recommends the introduction of <b>operation</b> <b>table</b> setting rooms. The project team also suggests the introduction of procedure packs, which are packages in which all disposable material needed for a type of surgery are combined in a single package. The new materials supply process, through externalisation of material handling activities, freesup time for the operation clinic personnel, and enables for more patient care, hence reduced changeover time between surgeries. The <b>operation</b> <b>table</b> setting rooms allow the <b>operation</b> <b>table</b> setting to be performed during ongoing surgery. The procedure packs simplify the cart packing by reducing the number of articles to collect, and they speed-up the <b>operation</b> <b>table</b> setting since fewer packages have to be opened. The externalisation of the disinfection process and the operation cart packing require a new ITsystem in which orders can be placed and information sharing between the central sterilisation department and the operation clinic is enabled. To further improve the communication between the two units, it would be beneficial if they could be located on the same floor, which requires a new operation building...|$|E
