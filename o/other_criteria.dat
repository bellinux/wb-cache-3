5|$|Since the 1990s, a more neutral view of Tourette's has emerged, {{in which}} {{biological}} vulnerability and adverse environmental events {{are seen to}} interact. In 2000, the American Psychiatric Association published the DSM-IV-TR, revising the text of DSM-IV to no longer require that symptoms of tic disorders cause distress or impair functioning, recognizing that clinicians often see patients who meet all the <b>other</b> <b>criteria</b> for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E
5|$|The tie-breaking {{rules have}} changed over the years, with the most recent changes being made in 2002 to {{accommodate}} the league's realignment into eight four-team divisions; record vs. common opponents {{and most of the}} <b>other</b> <b>criteria</b> involving wins and losses were moved up higher in the tie-breaking list, while those involving compiled stats such as points for and against were moved to the bottom.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the fifth}} edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), Tourette’s may be {{diagnosed}} when a person exhibits both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics over the period of a year; the motor and vocal tics need not be concurrent. The onset must have occurred {{before the age of}} 18, and cannot be attributed to the effects of another condition or substance (such as cocaine). Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—such as autism or other causes of tourettism—must be ruled out before conferring a Tourette's diagnosis. Since 2000, the DSM has recognized that clinicians see patients who meet all the <b>other</b> <b>criteria</b> for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E

5|$|OTA {{announced}} plans to include sound barriers at three points along the turnpike in April 1990. The locations were recommended by a report commissioned by OTA, using guidelines published by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). While another thirteen locations were likely to have similar noise levels as the three sites selected to receive barriers, abatement was not considered at those locations {{because they did not}} meet <b>other</b> <b>criteria,</b> including minimum population density. Although OTA was not required to follow FHWA guidelines on the Creek Turnpike because it was not a federally funded project, it opted to do so anyway.|$|E

5|$|Columbia University {{received}} 36,292 {{applications for}} its undergraduate class of 2020 (entering 2016). In early decision, 620 out of 3,520 applicants were admitted, for an acceptance rate of 17.61%. In regular decision, 1,573 out of 32,772 applicants were admitted, for an acceptance rate of 4.79%. For the Class of 2021, 2,185 out of 37,389 applicants were admitted for an overall acceptance rate of 5.8%, making Columbia {{the third most}} selective college in the United States behind Stanford and Harvard and the 2nd most selective college in the Ivy League. According to the 2012 college selectivity ranking by U.S. News & World Report, which factors admission and yield rates among <b>other</b> <b>criteria,</b> Columbia was tied with Yale, Caltech and MIT as the most selective colleges in the country. Columbia is a racially diverse school, with approximately 52% of all students identifying themselves as persons of color. Additionally, 50% of all undergraduates received grants from Columbia. The average grant size awarded to these students is $46,516. In 2015–2016, annual undergraduate tuition at Columbia was $50,526 with a total cost of attendance of $65,860 (including room and board).|$|E

5|$|The {{breeding}} {{success of}} the American white ibis is sensitive to the hydrological conditions of the ecosystem such as rainfall and water levels. Low and decreasing water levels predict good prey accessibility. Water level reversals, where levels rise in the breeding season, disperse prey and impact on foraging success. Nest numbers and average clutch sizes are smaller in periods of reduced prey availability. The success rate of parents raising one or more young to 20 days of age ranges widely from 5 to 70% of nests, and varies greatly between nearby colonies. American white ibis parents {{have been known to}} supplement their chicks' diet with items such as cockroaches and rotting food from human garbage in poorer years, when fish and crayfish are more scarce. Studies have also shown that years with higher nesting numbers had significantly faster spring drying rates of water bodies than years with low nesting numbers. This is because faster drying rates means that there are fewer fish and increased available area where crayfish can be hunted. This highlights the fact that American white ibises do not use probability of nesting failure as a key factor in determining nesting sites but instead, rely on <b>other</b> <b>criteria</b> such as prey availability and nest-site predation rates. The draining of wetlands in south Florida has also impacted on species that forage in shallow water such as the American white ibis, and its increase in numbers is a key indicator of restoration of habitat within the Everglades.|$|E
