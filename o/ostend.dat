5|$|The plan {{of attack}} was for the British raiding force to sink two {{obsolete}} cruisers in the canal mouth at <b>Ostend</b> and three at Zeebrugge, thus preventing raiding ships leaving Bruges. The <b>Ostend</b> canal was the smaller and narrower of the two channels giving access to Bruges and so was considered a secondary target behind the Zeebrugge Raid. Consequently, fewer resources were provided to the force assaulting <b>Ostend.</b> While the attack at Zeebrugge garnered some limited success, the assault on <b>Ostend</b> was a complete failure. The German marines who defended the port had taken careful preparations and drove the British assault ships astray, forcing the abortion of the operation at the final stage.|$|E
5|$|At <b>Ostend,</b> Vindictive did prevent larger {{warships}} {{passing through}} the channel, although smaller craft could still come and go at will. The larger warships in Bruges were trapped there for the remaining months of the war; the town was captured by the Allies in October 1918. The blockages at <b>Ostend</b> and Zeebrugge took several years to clear completely, not being totally removed until 1921. On a strategic scale {{the effects of the}} raids at <b>Ostend</b> and Zeebrugge on the battle of the Atlantic were negligible. Despite this, in Britain the <b>Ostend</b> Raid was feted as a success. Three Victoria Crosses and a host of lesser awards were given to the men involved. The Admiralty presented it as a fine example of daring and careful planning from the Royal Navy, providing a valuable morale boost at {{one of the most critical}} moments of the war.|$|E
5|$|The Second <b>Ostend</b> Raid (officially {{known as}} Operation VS) was the later of two failed {{attempts}} {{made during the}} spring of 1918 by the United Kingdom's Royal Navy to block the channels leading to the Belgian port of <b>Ostend</b> as a part of its conflict with the German Empire during World War I. Due to the significant strategic advantages conferred by the Belgian ports, the Imperial German Navy had used <b>Ostend</b> as a base for their U-boat activities during the Battle of the Atlantic since 1915.|$|E
5|$|The assault at Zeebrugge a {{few miles}} away from <b>Ostend</b> was more {{successful}} and the blocking of the major channel did cause some consternation amongst the German forces in Bruges. The larger raiders could no longer leave the port, but smaller ships, including most submarines, were still able to traverse via <b>Ostend.</b> In addition, within hours a narrow channel had also been carved through Zeebrugge too, although British intelligence did not realise this for several weeks. The defeat at <b>Ostend</b> did not entirely dampen the exuberant British media and public reaction to Zeebrugge, but in the Admiralty and particularly in the Allied Naval and Marine Forces the failure to completely neutralise Bruges rankled.|$|E
5|$|Two {{years passed}} {{before the next}} attempt on the <b>Ostend</b> locks. The First <b>Ostend</b> Raid was {{conducted}} {{in tandem with the}} similar Zeebrugge Raid led by Acting Vice-Admiral Roger Keyes on 23 April 1918; a large scale operation to block the wider canal at Zeebrugge. Both attacks largely failed, but while at Zeebrugge the operation came so close to success that it took several months for the British authorities to realise that it had been unsuccessful, at <b>Ostend</b> the attack had ended catastrophically. Both blockships intended to close off the canal had grounded over half a mile from their intended location and been scuttled by their crews under heavy artillery and long-range small arms fire, which caused severe casualties. Thus while Zeebrugge seemed to be blocked entirely, <b>Ostend</b> was open wide, nullifying any success that might have been achieved at the other port.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{defensive}} wall was never fully completed, many bunkers still exist near <b>Ostend,</b> Channel Islands, Scheveningen, Den Haag, Katwijk, and in Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian Naval Corps (Corps de Marine) was resurrected in 1939. Most of the Belgian {{merchant}} fleet, some 100 ships, evaded capture by the Germans. Under {{the terms}} of a Belgian–Royal Navy agreement, these ships and their 3,350 crewmen were placed under British control for the duration of hostilities. The General Headquarters of the Belgian Admiralty was at <b>Ostend</b> under the command of Major Henry Decarpentrie. The First Naval Division was based at <b>Ostend,</b> while the Second and Third divisions were based at Zeebrugge and Antwerp.|$|E
5|$|To block Bruges, Keyes and Lynes {{decided to}} conduct two raids on the ports through which Bruges {{had access to}} the sea. Zeebrugge was to be {{attacked}} by a large force consisting of three blockships and numerous supporting warships. <b>Ostend</b> was faced by a similar but smaller force under immediate command of Lynes. The plan was for two obsolete cruisers— and —to be expended in blocking the canal which emptied at <b>Ostend.</b> These ships would be stripped to essential fittings and their lower holds and ballast filled with rubble and concrete. This would make them ideal barriers to access if sunk in the correct channel at the correct angle.|$|E
5|$|After North-Beveland had {{surrendered}} on 18 May, Zeeuws-Vlaanderen was {{the last}} remaining unoccupied Dutch homeland territory. On orders of the French, all Dutch troops were withdrawn on 19 May to <b>Ostend</b> in Belgium, as their presence would be demoralising and confusing to their own forces. On 27 May all of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen had been occupied.|$|E
5|$|As British {{forces on}} the {{southeast}} coast of Britain regrouped, remanned and repaired following heavy losses at Zeebrugge, Keyes planned a return to <b>Ostend</b> {{with the intention of}} blocking the canal and consequently severing Bruges from the sea, closing the harbour and trapping the 18U-boats and 25destroyers present for months to come. Volunteers from among the force that had failed in April aided the planning with advice based on their experience on the previous operation. Among these volunteers were Lieutenant-Commander Henry Hardy of , Commander Alfred Godsal, former captain of , and Brilliants first lieutenant Victor Crutchley. These officers approached Commodore Hubert Lynes and Admiral Roger Keyes with a refined plan for a second attempt to block the port. Other officers came forward to participate and Keyes and Lynes devised an operational plan to attack the canal mouth at <b>Ostend</b> once again.|$|E
5|$|Kiliaen van Rensselaer {{was born}} in Hasselt, Overijssel, Netherlands in 1586. The exact day of his birth is unknown. He {{was the son of}} Hendrick van Rensselaer and Maria Pafraet. His father was a captain in the Dutch army until his death at the Siege of <b>Ostend</b> in early June 1602.|$|E
5|$|Swiftsure was {{assigned}} to convoy escort duties in the Atlantic from early 1916 until she was paid off in April 1917 to provide crews for anti-submarine vessels. In mid-1918, the ship was disarmed and stripped {{in order to be}} used as a blockship during a proposed second raid on <b>Ostend.</b> Swiftsure was sold for scrap in 1920.|$|E
5|$|All {{preparations}} for the operation were completed by {{the first week of}} May and on 9 May the weather was nearly perfect for the attack. The British armada had collected at Dunkirk in Allied-held France and departed port shortly after dark. Two minutes after midnight, the force suffered a setback when Sappho suffered a minor boiler explosion and had to return to Dunkirk, unable to complete the journey. Although this accident halved the ability of the force to block <b>Ostend,</b> Lynes decided to continue the operation, and at 01:30, the force closed on the port, making the final {{preparations for}} the assault. Torpedoes fired from motor launches demolished machine gun posts on the ends of the piers marking the canal, beginning the attack. Ten heavy bombers of the newly formed Royal Air Force then dropped incendiary bombs on German positions, but did not cause significant damage. In spite of the fog, air operations continued as planned under the overall direction of Brigadier-General Charles Lambe. At {{the same time as the}} aerial bombardment began, the long range artillery of the Royal Marine Artillery opened fire on <b>Ostend</b> from Allied positions around the Belgian town of Ypres.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, Lasker {{played in}} <b>Ostend</b> against Mikhail Chigorin, a six-game match that was {{sponsored}} by the wealthy lawyer and industrialist Isaac Rice in order to test the Rice Gambit. Lasker narrowly lost the match. Three years later Lasker became secretary of the Rice Gambit Association, founded by Rice in order to promote the Rice Gambit, and in 1907 Lasker quoted with approval Rice's views on the convergence of chess and military strategy.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the attack, Godsal and Lynes had carefully consulted available charts of <b>Ostend</b> following the previous operation's failure caused by German repositioning of navigation buoys. This careful study was, however, rendered worthless by a sudden fog which obliterated all sight of the shore. Steaming {{back and forth across}} the harbour entrance in the fog as the monitors and German shore batteries engaged in a long range artillery duel over the lost cruiser, Godsal looked for the piers marking the entrance to the canal. As he searched, two German torpedo boats sailed from <b>Ostend</b> to intercept the cruiser, but in the heavy fog they collided and, disabled, limped back to shore. During this period, Godsal's motor launches lost track of the cruiser in the murk, and it was not until the third pass that Vindictive found the entrance, accompanied by only one of the launches. Heading straight into the mouth of the canal, guided by a flare dropped by the launch, Vindictive became an instant target of the German batteries and was badly damaged, the shellfire exacerbating the damage suffered in the earlier Zeebrugge Raid and seriously damaging Vindictives port propeller.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the now-outnumbered Belgians {{abandoned}} Brussels and the Government fled to <b>Ostend.</b> The {{city was}} occupied by the German Army on 17 May. The very next morning, Hoepner, the German XVI Corps commander, was ordered to release the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions to Army Group A. This left the 9th Panzer Division attached to the Eighteenth Army as the only armoured unit on the Belgian front.|$|E
5|$|The {{flotilla}} {{was next}} in action {{during the night}} 29/30 July again off <b>Ostend,</b> when the flotilla in company with two Motor Torpedo Boats (MTB) engaged a convoy of three Flak trawlers and two merchant ships. One of the merchant ships was hit by torpedoes from the MTBs while the MGBs engaged the other by dropping depth charges. With those ships destroyed they then engaged the Flak trawlers.|$|E
5|$|The {{service to}} <b>Ostend</b> via Dover was re-introduced on 18 January 1919. Civilian trains to Boulogne via Folkestone {{restarted}} on 3 February. Boat train services to Newhaven started on 1 June, and {{a connection with}} Paris started on 15 July. On 8 January 1920, Victoria replaced Charing Cross as the main station for Continental services, as it had more facilities and closer locomotive and carriage facilities. The service to Paris via Calais and Dover began on the same day.|$|E
5|$|The {{third major}} action Hichens was {{involved}} in during this period was the action during the night of 21/22 April 1942, off <b>Ostend,</b> when they engaged six E boats, forcing the superior force to scatter and run for port after severely damaging one boat and causing slight damage to the others. After this action the E boats were moved to a safer harbour to operate from. Hichens was awarded a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) following this engagement.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} air {{activity}} over German-held territory. RAF Bomber Command flew 92 sorties against German invasion targets at Boulogne, Calais, <b>Ostend,</b> Dunkirk, and Antwerp. The remaining sorties were directed at Brussels marshalling yards, Hamm and Krefeld. One Armstrong Whitworth Whitley failed to return. It {{was lost to}} ground fire over the Netherlands. A total of 157 sorties were flown overall. By the September 1940, some 10–13% of invasion barges had been sunk.|$|E
5|$|Three {{weeks after}} {{the failure of the}} operation, a second attack was {{launched}} which proved more successful in sinking a blockship {{at the entrance to the}} canal but ultimately did not close off Bruges completely. Further plans to attack <b>Ostend</b> came to nothing during the summer of 1918, and the threat from Bruges would not be finally stopped until the last days of the war, when the town was liberated by Allied land forces.|$|E
5|$|Wellington's initial dispositions were {{intended}} {{to counter the threat}} of Napoleon enveloping the Coalition armies by moving through Mons to the south-west of Brussels. This would have pushed Wellington closer to Blücher, but may have cut Wellington's communications with his base at <b>Ostend.</b> In order to delay Wellington's deployment, Napoleon spread false intelligence which suggested that Wellington's supply chain from the channel ports would be cut.|$|E
5|$|After the {{beginning}} of World War I in August 1914, Swiftsure escorted troop convoys in the Indian Ocean until she {{was transferred to the}} Suez Canal Patrol in December. After defending the Canal in early 1915 from Ottoman attacks, the ship was then transferred to the Dardanelles in February and saw action in the Dardanelles Campaign bombarding Ottoman fortifications. Swiftsure was assigned to convoy escort duties in the Atlantic from early 1916 until she was paid off in April 1917 to provide crews for anti-submarine vessels. In mid-1918, the ship was disarmed {{to be used as a}} blockship during a proposed second raid on <b>Ostend.</b> Swiftsure was sold for scrap in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Artillery and {{long-range}} {{machine gun}} fire continued to riddle the wrecks and the combined crews {{were ordered to}} evacuate as the officers set the scuttling charges which would sink the blockships in their current, useless locations. As men scrambled {{down the side of}} the cruisers into Coastal Motor Boats which would relay them to the Offshore Squadron, destroyers moved closer to <b>Ostend</b> to cover the retreat and the monitors continued their heavy fire. Godsal was the last to leave, picked up by launch ML276 commanded by Lieutenant Rowley Bourke. With the main assault a complete failure, the blockading forces returned to Dover and Dunkirk to assess the disaster.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Victoria's brother, Ernest Louis, {{died and}} soon {{afterwards}} her widowed sister-in-law, nephew, granddaughter {{and two of}} her great-grandchildren all died in an air crash at <b>Ostend.</b> Victoria's granddaughter, Princess Cecilie of Greece and Denmark, had married Victoria's nephew (Ernest Louis's son), George Donatus of Hesse. They and their two young sons, Louis and Alexander, were all killed. Cecilie was pregnant {{at the time and}} the stillborn child was found among the wreckage. Cecilie's youngest child, Johanna, who was not on the plane, was adopted by her uncle Prince Louis of Hesse and by Rhine but the little girl only survived her parents and older brothers by eighteen months, dying in 1939 of meningitis.|$|E
5|$|Maria Theresa {{replaced}} Maria Josepha as {{heir presumptive}} to the Habsburg realms {{the moment she}} was born; Charles VI had issued the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 which had placed his nieces behind his own daughters {{in the line of}} succession. Charles sought the other European powers' approval for disinheriting his nieces. They exacted harsh terms: in the Treaty of Vienna (1731), Great Britain demanded that Austria abolish the <b>Ostend</b> Company in return for its recognition of the Pragmatic Sanction. In total, Great Britain, France, Saxony-Poland, United Provinces, Spain, Venice, the Papal States, Prussia, Russia, Denmark-Norway, Savoy-Sardinia, Bavaria and the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire recognised the sanction. France, Spain, Saxony-Poland, Bavaria and Prussia later reneged.|$|E
5|$|Such {{an order}} ignored {{the fact that}} the Belgian Army could not {{withdraw}} to the Yser, and there was little chance of any Belgian Cavalry joining in the attack. The plan for the Belgian withdrawal was sound; the Yser river covered Dunkirk to the east and south, while the La Bassée Canal covered it from the west. The ring of the Yser also dramatically shorted the Belgian Army's area of operations. Such a move would have abandoned Passchendaele and Ypres and would have certainly meant the capture of <b>Ostend</b> while further reducing the amount of Belgian territory still free by a few square miles.|$|E
5|$|The First <b>Ostend</b> Raid on 23 April 1918 {{was largely}} a failure, the blockships {{grounded}} {{too far from the}} channels to obstruct them. The second attempt also failed, due to heavy German resistance and British navigational difficulties in poor weather. In anticipation of a raid, the Germans had removed the navigation buoys and without them the British had difficulty finding the narrow channel into the harbour in poor weather. When they did discover the entrance, German resistance proved too strong for the operation to be completed as originally planned: the obsolete cruiser HMS Vindictive was sunk, but only partially blocked the channel.|$|E
5|$|The same {{social forces}} that had built these resorts {{in the nineteenth}} century proved to be their undoing in the twentieth. Transport links {{continued}} to improve and it became possible to travel overseas quickly and affordably. The Belgian coast at <b>Ostend</b> became popular with Northern working-class tourists {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century, and the introduction of package holidays in the 1970s was the death of most Northern seaside resorts. Blackpool has maintained a focus on tourism, and remains one of the most visited towns in England, but visitor numbers are far below their peak and the town's economy has suffered – both employment rates and average earnings remain below the regional average.|$|E
5|$|U-9, {{commanded}} by Kapitänleutnant Otto Weddigen, {{had been ordered}} to attack British transports at <b>Ostend,</b> but {{had been forced to}} dive and take shelter from the storm. On surfacing, she spotted the British ships and moved to attack. She fired one torpedo at 06:20 at Aboukir which struck her on the starboard side; the ship's captain thought he had struck a mine and ordered the other two ships to close to transfer his wounded men. Aboukir quickly began listing and capsized around 06:55 despite counterflooding compartments on the opposite side to right her.|$|E
5|$|After the German Army {{captured}} much of Belgium {{following the}} Battle of the Frontiers in 1914, the Allied forces were left holding a thin strip of coastline {{to the west}} of the Yser. The remainder of the Belgian coast came under the occupation of German Marine Divisions, including the important strategic ports of Antwerp and Bruges. A network of canals connected Bruges with the coast at <b>Ostend</b> and Zeebrugge, through which small warships such as destroyers, light cruisers and submarines could travel and find a safe harbour from which to launch raids into the English Channel and along the coasts of southeast England. U-boats could also depart from Bruges at night, cutting a day off the journey to the Western Approaches, more easily avoiding the North Sea Mine Barrage and allowing U-boat captains to gain familiarity with the net and mine defences of the English Channel, through which they had to pass to reach the main battlegrounds of the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Caesar was brought back into full commission and transferred to the 7th Battle Squadron of the Channel Fleet; the squadron was charged with the defence of the English Channel. During this service she helped in transporting the Plymouth Marine Division from Plymouth to <b>Ostend,</b> Belgium, and covered {{the passage of the}} British Expeditionary Force from England to France in September 1914. In December 1914, Caesar was detached from the 7th Battle Squadron and transferred to Gibraltar to serve as guard ship and gunnery training ship there. In July 1915, she transferred to the North America and West Indies Station, serving as guard ship and gunnery training ship at Bermuda and patrolling the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Germans invaded Belgium in May 1940, there were still 40 tonnes of gold left in Belgium, held at the bank's offices in the port of <b>Ostend.</b> The only ship {{available}} in the area was A4, commanded by Lieutenant Van Vaerenbergh. On 19 May 1940, the vessel was loaded with the gold and, avoiding Dunkirk which was being bombed by the Luftwaffe, headed for the British coast, accompanied by the ship P16 which was carrying refugees. After being transferred from port to port because of concerns {{for the safety of}} the cargo during unloading, the gold was landed at Plymouth on 26 May, two days before the Belgian surrender. The gold was finally deposited at the Bank of England. A4 also carried Hubert Ansiaux, the civil servant charged with overseeing the evacuation of the gold to England and the future Governor of the National Bank.|$|E
5|$|Crillon served again under d'Harcourt in 1744 {{when the}} latter {{commanded}} the Army of the Moselle during its campaigns along the Rhine. He {{participated in the}} siege of Fribourg and spent the winter in Swabia {{under the command of}} Marshal Coigny as colonel of an infantry regiment. In May 1745, he fought in the major Battle of Fontenoy near Tournai in modern-day Belgium and captured nearly 50 pieces of artillery from the Dutch, British, and Hanoverian alliance opposing the French. The following month he was appointed brigadier. On 10 July, he fought in what the French termed the battle of the Mésle at Dendermonde near Ghent, leading 8,000 men to victory against a British, Austrian and Dutch force. He then took part in the captures of Ghent, <b>Ostend</b> and Nieuwpoort.|$|E
5|$|Despite German {{claims that}} the {{blockage}} did not impede their operations, the operation to close the <b>Ostend</b> canal {{seemed to have been}} at least partially successful. The channel was largely blocked and so Bruges was ostensibly closed off from the open sea, even if the position of the blockship meant that smaller ships could get through. In fact, the entire operation had been rendered moot before it even began, due to events at the wider canal in Zeebrugge. British assessments of that operation had proven optimistic and the channel there had not been properly closed. Small coastal submarines of the UC class had been able to pass through the channel as early as the morning after the Zeebrugge Raid and German naval engineers were able to dredge channels around the blockages at both ports over the coming weeks.|$|E
5|$|His {{popularity}} in the Northern states declined sharply after he supported the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which nullified the Missouri Compromise, while many whites in the South continued to support him. Passage of the act led to violent conflict over the expansion of slavery in the American West. Pierce's administration was further damaged when several of his diplomats issued the <b>Ostend</b> Manifesto, calling for the annexation of Cuba, a document which was roundly criticized. Although Pierce fully expected to be renominated by the Democrats in the 1856 presidential election, he was abandoned by his party and his bid failed. His reputation in the North suffered further during the Civil War as he became a vocal critic of President Abraham Lincoln. Pierce, {{who had been a}} heavy drinker for much of his life, died of severe cirrhosis of the liver in 1869.|$|E
