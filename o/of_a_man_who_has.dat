The real Marcus Junius Brutus was the most famous of Julius Caesar's assassins, and one of the key figures in the civil wars that followed the assassination.|$|E
500|$|The {{subject of}} unrequited love {{was one of}} the major ones in Cerna's lyric poems and, Călinescu argues, it evoked his actual {{experience}} with women, as [...] "the regret of not having lived through the great mystery of love." [...] These pieces, the critic notes, point to the influence of Classicist authors such as Eminescu, Dante Aligheri, and Giacomo Leopardi (the latter poet had also been quoted in Cerna's Die Gedankenlyrik). One of the pieces, written from the perspective <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> once failed to gain the object of his affection, features the lyrics: ...|$|E
500|$|Other Jewish stories depict vampires {{in a more}} {{traditional}} way. In [...] "The Kiss of Death", {{the daughter of the}} demon king Ashmodai snatches the breath <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> betrayed her, strongly reminiscent of a fatal kiss of a vampire. A rare story found in Sefer Hasidim #1465 tells of an old vampire named Astryiah who uses her hair to drain the blood from her victims. A similar tale from the same book describes staking a witch through the heart to ensure she does not come back from the dead to haunt her enemies.|$|E

500|$|Allen's death made {{nationwide}} headlines. The Bennington Gazette {{wrote of}} the local hero, [...] "the patriotism and strong attachment which ever appeared uniform in the breast of this Great Man, was worth of his exalted character; the public have to lament the loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> rendered them great service". Although most obituaries were positive, a number of clergymen expressed different sentiments. [...] "Allen was an ignorant and profane Deist, who died with a mind replete with horror and despair" [...] was the opinion of Newark, New Jersey's Reverend Uzal Ogden. Yale's Timothy Dwight expressed satisfaction that the world {{no longer had to}} deal with a man of [...] "peremptoriness and effrontery, rudeness and ribaldry". It is not recorded what New York Governor Clinton's reaction was to the news.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] {{speaks about}} {{two women who}} chose not to end a {{friendship}} because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> cheated both of them. Its theme is one of female independence. Beyoncé told MTV News that [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] is about female empowerment, {{in keeping with the}} theme of the album: [...] "It's about a guy who's kind of playing both of us, and instead of us arguing over the guy we say, 'Forget him. Let's stick together. He's a beautiful liar." [...] The chorus features the lines, [...] "Let's not kill the karma, let's not start a fight" [...] with the female protagonists bonding in their mutual betrayal. Beyoncé and Shakira sing with staccato, intense vocal approach throughout the song. Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "I didn't know about you then, till I saw you with him again" [...] earnestly while Shakira later adds [...] "I walked in on your love scene, slow dancing". In the end, the female protagonists conclude, [...] "we can live without him", referring to their cheating lover.|$|E
500|$|Chief among Burroughs' {{complaints}} was Long's {{questioning of}} the role of instinct in animal learning, something that Burroughs and many scientists of the day accepted without doubt. Long had written that after many years of studying wild animals, he was [...] "convinced that instinct plays a much smaller part than we have supposed; that an animal's success or failure in the ceaseless struggle for life depends, not upon instinct, but upon the kind of training which the animal learns from its mother." [...] In reply to this assertion, Burroughs wrote in [...] "Real and Sham Natural History": [...] "The crows do not train their young. They have no fortresses, or schools, or colleges, or examining boards, or diplomas, or medals of honor, or hospitals, or churches, or telephones, or postal deliveries, or anything of the sort. Indeed, the poorest backwoods hamlet has more of the appurtenances of civilization than the best organized crow or other wild animal community in the land!" [...] Burroughs summed up by deeming Long a fraud, stating that his [...] "book reads like that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> really never been to the woods, but who sits in his study and cooks up these yarns from things he has read in Forest and Stream, or in other sporting journals. Of real observation there is hardly a vestige in his book; of deliberate trifling with natural history there is no end".|$|E

[...] "The Shores of Hispaniola" [...] was recorded as part of the Elizabethan Session project, a collaboration between folk musicians Nancy Kerr, Martin Simpson, Jim Moray, Bella Hardy, John Smith, Hannah James, Rachel Newton and Emily Askew. Mentioned by Rza in Books of war song with MF Doom.|$|E

His off-driving and punches behind square seemed to bear [...] "a brutal stamp of {{efficiency}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> scored five centuries in a year". He dominated Zaheer Khan, and Ajit Agarkar, taking advantage of their mistakes, but his batting against Kumble was a major concern, as he did not play him with certainty or with the assuredness he displayed against other bowlers. He was lucky to survive some close chances off Kumble's bowling.|$|E

[...] She then [...] discovers that Tempest has a wife and son already, making their {{marriage}} a sham and Rosamond the unwitting mistress <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> grossly deceived her. [...] That same night, she packs a few items, stealthily climbs down from her second-floor balcony, and catches the next train to Paris.

His story begins with his childhood experiences as a sickly afterthought, weighed down by the loveless union of his parents. From there he traces the odyssey {{that led to his}} search for early postglacial man—and into inspiriting philosophical territory—culminating in his uneasy achievement of world renown.

2500|$|... "Gerontion" [...] is {{a poem by}} T. S. Eliot {{that was}} first {{published}} in 1920. The work relates the opinions and impressions of a gerontic, or elderly man, through a dramatic monologue which describes Europe after World War I through the eyes <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> lived the majority of his life in the 19th century. Eliot considered using this already published poem as a preface to The Waste Land, but decided to keep it as an independent poem. Along with [...] "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" [...] and The Waste Land, and other works published by Eliot {{in the early part of}} his career, '"Gerontion" [...] discusses themes of religion, sexuality, and other general topics of modernist poetry.|$|E

Daniel Heartz suggests that eventually Constanze moved in with Mozart, which would have placed her in disgrace by the mores of the time. Mozart wrote to Leopold on 31 July 1782, [...] "All the good and well-intentioned advice you have sent fails to address the case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> already gone so far with a maiden. Further postponement is out of the question." [...] Heartz relates, [...] "Constanze's sister Sophie had tearfully declared that her mother would send the police after Constanze if she did not return home [...]" [...] On 4 August, Mozart wrote to Baroness von Waldstätten, asking: [...] "Can the police here enter anyone's house in this way? Perhaps it is only a ruse of Madame Weber to get her daughter back. If not, I know no better remedy than to marry Constanze tomorrow morning or if possible today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Albee’s {{directing}} {{almost every}} line of dialogue demonstrates {{that he has}} very specific psychological meanings behind his words. He {{is aware of the}} characters’ thoughts and the emotions behind their words and wants {{to make sure that the}} actors understand them. He is not willing to allow the actors to interpret the play on their own. He uses terms like “quiet despair”, “surprised delight”, “slight schoolteacher tone”, and “the way a nurse speaks to a disturbed patient”. [...] He often writes directions about how the actors should hold their hands, turn their heads, or change their facial expressions to include a narrowing of their eyes. The longest script notation that Albee writes occurs toward the end of act 3, before a monologue delivered by the character Tobias. Albee’s directions read: [...] "This next is an aria. It must have in its performance all the horror and exuberance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> kept his emotions under control too long. Tobias will be carried to the edge of hysteria, and he will find himself laughing, sometimes, while he cries from sheer release. All in all, it is genuine and bravura at the same time, one prolonging the other. I shall try to notate it somewhat." ...|$|E
