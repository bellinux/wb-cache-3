The results showed that acts of lethal, but utilitarian, harm were judged more immoral than omissions of equivalent harm. It was also shown that if the victim was an in- group member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>the</b> behavior was judged more immoral than if the victim was an out-group member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant.</b> However, <b>the</b> acts and omissions of harm were not judged differently when the victim was an in. - vs. out-group member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant,</b> indicating that this kind of social distance might not influence <b>the</b> moral judgment <b>of</b> acts and omissions. ...|$|R

Firstly, 65.4 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VET <b>participants</b> were in disagreement that a career in hospitality was outweighed with disadvantages, while only 34.9 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HE <b>participants</b> indicated this view. Therefore, hospitality was viewed as being a satisfactory career path by 87.5 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VET <b>participants</b> as compared to 59.1 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HE <b>participants,</b> and being a promising vocational future perceived by 81.6 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VET <b>participants</b> (M[*] =  2.47) and 48.3 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HE <b>participants</b> (M[*] =  3.36).

5|$|The Monbar Hotel {{attack was}} carried out by the GAL, a state-sponsored death squad, on 25 September 1985 in Bayonne, France. The targets were four members of ETA military, whom the Spanish {{government}} believed to be senior figures in the organisation, itself proscribed as a terrorist group in Spain and France. All four people were killed, with a fifth person, apparently unconnected to ETA, injured in the shooting. This represented the deadliest attack carried out by the GAL. Although two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> were apprehended shortly after the shooting, controversy surrounded the possible involvement of senior figures in the Spanish police.|$|E

5|$|The {{duration}} of time until an eventual reward also affects participants' choice of immediate or delayed gratification. A 2001 study demonstrated {{that if a}} reward will not be granted for an extensive amount of time, such as 180–300 months (15–25 years), the monetary amount of the reward is inconsequential; instead, the bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> choose the immediate reward, even if their delayed reward would be quite large. Delayed gratification has its limits, and a delay can only be so long before it is judged to be not worth the effort it takes to wait.|$|E

5|$|After Climbié's death, {{the parties}} {{involved}} in her case were widely criticised. A public inquiry, headed by Lord Laming, was ordered.

The subsequent report by Laming made numerous recommendations related to child protection in England. Climbié's death was largely responsible for the formation of the Every Child Matters initiative; the introduction of the Children Act 2004; the creation of the ContactPoint project, a government database designed to hold information on all children in England (now defunct after closure by the government of 2010); and the creation of the Office of the Children's Commissioner chaired by the Children's Commissioner for England.|$|E

On the September 5 episode of Raw, Fox was involved in a backstage confrontation with Nia Jax, resulting in a match between the two on the September 12 episode of Raw, which would end in a no contest after Jax speared Fox through the ringside barricade. On September 25, a rematch took place at Clash of Champions, where Fox was defeated. After suffering a streak of losses, Fox scored a victory over Dana Brooke on the November 4 episode of Superstars. On the November 7 episode of Raw, Fox was announced as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in the 5-on-5 Traditional Survivor Series Women's Elimination match at Survivor Series from her brand's team, before winning a six-woman tag team match along with her fellow team partners.

5|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for {{a short amount of time}} and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.|$|E

Several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> had recently joined CMLL, leaving the Universal Wrestling Association to join CMLL and its recently restarted women's division.

The finals came down to Lola Gonzales, a pioneer for women's wrestling in Mexico, and Bull Nakano, a Japanese wrestler that worked regularly for CMLL. The following week, on June 12, 1993 Bull Nakano became the first CMLL World Women's Champion by virtue of her victory over Lola Gonzales.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Morrissey {{developed}} a filmmaking craft at the Rathbone Theatre Workshop, a Youth Opportunities Programme that taught school-leavers skills for a year. With the workshop, Morrissey shot short silent films on Super 8, {{where he was}} taught by Bert Byron, who introduced him to US Independent and foreign films for the first time. Although the scheme paid £23.50 a week and took young people off unemployment benefits, Morrissey reflected in 2009 that many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> were just used as lackeys. After his acting career escalated, he started directing because he was aware that, as an actor, he was coming into a project quite late into development and then leaving before post-production, {{and he wanted to}} see a film through to the end. Morrissey has said that he prefers to keep acting and directing separate, and would not direct anything he is acting in.|$|E

5|$|Ivanović {{had left}} Vienna in 1840 {{and gone to}} study at the Munich Academy, {{possibly}} owing to Czacki's further generosity. Subsequent statements suggest that Ivanović was inspired to paint The Conquest of Belgrade around this time. Writing in 1873, she recalled how the painting came about: While studying at the Munich Academy, I started to read History of the Serb People. I wanted to paint the brave battle of Mirko on my canvas. With seven of his comrades he succeeded in entering the city at night while the Muslims were celebrating Bajram (Eid al-Fitr) and didn't even think about any danger. Mirko and his comrades killed the guards at the town gate. Their rifle shots were the signal for the others. Ivanović soon travelled to Belgrade, visited the battlesite, conversed with some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in Belgrade's capture, and examined period clothing and weaponry used in the battle. She created the composition in 1844–45; it was painted in Belgrade.|$|E
