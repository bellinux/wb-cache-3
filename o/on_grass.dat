5|$|The Australian Open court surface changed once, from grass {{courts to}} hardcourts in 1988.

Roger Federer is the only player to have won on both the Rebound Ace and Plexicushion tennis surfaces.|$|E

5|$|A {{brain and}} a subtle ear {{has gone into}} the making of this poem...celebrating the mystery of Christ's conception.

The emphasis on Mary's freedom of choice, {{at the moment of}} the annunciation, is theologically strictly proper.|$|E
5|$|At Wimbledon, Federer {{entered the}} tournament {{not only as}} the four-time {{defending}} champion, but also riding a 48-match winning streak <b>on</b> <b>grass.</b> Once again, he defeated Rafael Nadal for a second consecutive year in the final, this time in a thrilling five-set encounter that many analysts hailed as the greatest Wimbledon final since 1980. Victory at Wimbledon equaled him with Björn Borg for the record of five consecutive championships at the All England Club.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Federer {{failed to}} reach the finals {{of the first two}} Grand Slam tournaments, losing the Australian Open {{semifinal}} to eventual champion Safin after holding match points, and the French Open semifinal to eventual champion Rafael Nadal. However, Federer quickly reestablished his dominance <b>on</b> <b>grass,</b> winning the Wimbledon Championships over Andy Roddick. At the US Open, Federer defeated Andre Agassi in the latter's last major final.|$|E
5|$|Murray won for {{the first}} time <b>on</b> <b>grass</b> at Queen's and became the first British winner of the tournament since 1938. In the final Murray {{defeated}} American James Blake. At Wimbledon, against Stanislas Wawrinka, Murray's fourth round match was the first match to be played entirely under Wimbledon's retractable roof, also enabling it to be the latest finishing match ever at Wimbledon. However Murray lost a tight semifinal to Andy Roddick.|$|E

5|$|The Bills struck back quickly. On {{the first}} play of the fourth quarter, Thurman Thomas ran for a 31-yard {{touchdown}} that put the Bills back in front, 19–17. A few possessions later, the Giants drove down to the Bills' 4-yard line but {{had to settle for}} a 21-yard field goal by Matt Bahr that gave the Giants a 20–19 lead. Both teams exchanged possessions before the Bills began one final drive. The Bills drove down to the Giants' 30-yard line to set up a game-winning 47-yard field goal attempt by Scott Norwood. Just before the kick, ABC showed a graphic indicating that, <b>on</b> <b>grass</b> that season, Norwood had only made three of seven field goals from at least 40yards, and that the 47-yarder would be Norwood's longest ever <b>on</b> <b>grass.</b> A few moments later, in what became the game's signature moment, Norwood's attempt missed wide right, and the Giants won their second Super Bowl in five years, 20–19.|$|E
5|$|David Nalbandian was Federer's biggest {{rival in}} his early career. The two played each other 19 times, with Federer leading 11–8. Nalbandian {{dominated}} early on, winning their first five matches from 2002–03. Federer reversed this trend at the 2003 Masters Cup, where he recorded his first victory, and {{would go on to}} win 11 of their last 14 meetings. Federer leads 6–5 on hard courts, 1–0 <b>on</b> <b>grass,</b> and 3–1 on clay courts, while Nalbandian leads 2–1 on carpet. Notable meetings include Nalbandian's win in a fifth-set tiebreaker to win the 2005 Masters Cup, and Federer's win in the 2006 French Open semifinals. They met each other six times in Grand Slam tournaments, with Federer leading 4–2.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Serb {{being the}} {{favourite}} {{to win the}} title throughout the Championships, Murray overcame Djokovic in a straight sets match that lasted over three hours, {{to become the first}} British winner of the men's singles title since Fred Perry in 1936, the first Scot of either sex to win a Wimbledon singles title since Harold Mahony in 1896, and to extend his winning streak <b>on</b> <b>grass</b> to 18 matches. With the win, he also became only the second man in the open era after Rafael Nadal to hold the Olympic singles gold medal and Wimbledon title simultaneously.|$|E

5|$|Fifteen {{of their}} 38 matches {{have been on}} clay which is {{statistically}} Nadal's best surface and Federer's worst, with 13 being in finals. Nadal has a winning record on outdoor hard courts (8–6) and clay (13–2), while Federer leads <b>on</b> <b>grass</b> (2–1) and indoor hard courts (5–1). Because tournament seedings are based on rankings, 24 of their matches have been in tournament finals which have included an all-time record 9 Grand Slam tournament finals. From 2006 to 2008 they played in every French Open and Wimbledon final. Nadal won six of the nine, losing the first two Wimbledon finals. Four of these finals were five set-matches (2007 and 2008 Wimbledon, 2009 and 2017 Australian Open), with the 2008 Wimbledon final being lauded as the greatest match ever by many long-time tennis analysts. Thirteen of their 38 meetings have reached a deciding set. They have also played in 12 Masters Series finals, including their lone five-hour match at the 2006 Rome Masters which Nadal won in a fifth-set tie-break having saved two match points and at the 2005 Miami Masters where Federer came back from 2 sets down to win in nearly 4 hours. They also contested {{the final of the}} ATP World Tour Finals in 2010 with Federer winning in 3 sets. Nadal has defeated Federer <b>on</b> <b>grass</b> in Wimbledon (which is Federer's better surface) but Federer {{has not been able to}} beat Nadal on clay in Roland Garros losing to him several times.|$|E
5|$|Going into Wimbledon, Murray had {{not lost}} a match <b>on</b> <b>grass</b> since the {{previous}} year's final, {{and was on}} a winning streak of 11 matches <b>on</b> <b>grass.</b> In the first two rounds, Murray faced Benjamin Becker and Yen-hsun Lu respectively, defeating both in straight sets. His third round match was against 32nd seed Tommy Robredo, and despite a tour comeback over the past year, Murray overcame the Spaniard in straight sets {{to set up a}} clash with Mikhail Youzhny, the highest seed left in Murray's half following the unexpectedly early exits of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Despite facing a fightback in the second set, Murray won in straight sets to make it through to his tenth consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal, in which he was to play Fernando Verdasco, the first left-handed player Murray had faced since the 2012 US Open. For the seventh time in his career, Murray had to come back from a deficit of two sets to ultimately come through in five, setting up a semifinal clash with 24th seed Jerzy Janowicz, the Polish player who beat Murray in their previous encounter. After Murray failed to break Janowicz's serve, the Pole took the opening set in the tiebreak, following a double fault from Murray. However Murray managed to up his level of play, and won the next three sets, making it through to his second consecutive Wimbledon final, and third consecutive major final against Novak Djokovic.|$|E
5|$|Kuznetsova {{played a}} steady grass season, with a win–loss of 6–3, the second-best result judged by wins {{in her career}} <b>on</b> <b>grass.</b> She reached {{the second round of}} Wimbledon {{for the first time since}} 2011. Kuznetsova withdrew from most of the North America tournaments, {{including}} the Rogers Cup and Cincinnati, due to a left leg injury. At the US Open, she lost in the first round to Kristina Mladenovic. Kuznetsova renewed herself in Guangzhou, reaching the quarterfinals. She eventually received her first trophy this season at the Kremlin Cup with a straight sets victory over Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the final, becoming the 15th title in her career.|$|E

5|$|Murray and Stan Wawrinka {{have played}} 18 times with Murray leading 10–8. Murray leads 7–4 on hard courts and 2–0 <b>on</b> <b>grass</b> courts while Wawrinka leads 4–1 on clay courts. They have also met {{six times in}} Grand Slam tournaments with each player winning three matches. They have contested some close matches and {{one of their most}} notable matches was in the 2009 Wimbledon fourth round which Murray won in five sets and was the first men's match to be played under the Wimbledon roof, having the latest finish for a Wimbledon match at the time. Wawrinka also ended Murray's title defense at the 2013 US Open quarterfinals with a {{comfortable}} straight sets victory. Other close matches the two have contested include the 2010 US Open which Wawrinka won in four sets. Murray won the 2008 Canada Open and 2011 Shanghai Masters.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{has played}} against Rafael Nadal on 24 {{occasions}} since 2007, with Nadal leading 17–7. Nadal leads 7–2 on clay, 3–0 <b>on</b> <b>grass</b> and 7–5 on hard courts.

Eight of these nine appearances have been at quarterfinal and semifinal level. They have never met in a Slam final, however, Murray leads 3–1 in ATP finals, with Nadal winning at Indian Wells in 2009 and Murray winning in Rotterdam the same year, Tokyo in 2011, and at Madrid in 2015.|$|E
