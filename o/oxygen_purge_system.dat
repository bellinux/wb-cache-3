5000|$|An {{emergency}} backup {{was provided}} {{in case the}} main system failed, by a separate unit called the <b>Oxygen</b> <b>Purge</b> <b>System</b> (OPS), mounted {{on top of the}} PLSS, immediately behind the astronaut's helmet.The OPS maintained suit pressure and removed carbon dioxide, heat and water vapor through a continuous, one-way air flow vented to space. When activated, the OPS provided oxygen to a separate inlet on the pressure suit, once a vent valve on a separate suit outlet was manually opened. The OPS provided a maximum of about 30 minutes of emergency oxygen for breathing and cooling. This could be extended to 75 to 90 minutes with a [...] "buddy system" [...] hose that used the other astronaut's functional PLSS for cooling (only). This allowed the vent valve to be partly closed to decrease the oxygen flow rate.|$|E

40|$|Spaceborne lidar are a {{promising}} new technology {{with the potential}} to provide significant information about the climate of Earth and other planetary bodies. Europe’s first spaceborne lidars are due to fly as primary payloads on both ADM-Aeolus (Aladin) and EarthCARE (ATLID) within the next few years. During vacuum tests, Aladin was found to malfunction due to complications from the phenomenon of laser inducedcontamination. Consequently, ESA and Astrium SAS identified a need for an <b>oxygen</b> <b>purge</b> <b>system</b> onboard ADM-Aeolus to allow the Power Laser Heads (PLHs) to function nominally. In response Astrium Ltd proposed an in-situ cleaning system (ICS), which involves the enclosure of the PLH components in a 40 Pa oxygen environment. ATLID, being earlier in its design phases has learned from Aladin and plans to fully pressurise the instrument with air to atmospheric pressure. A key challenge for the implementation of these instruments is the impact of convection and conduction of the gas medium on a system with stringent optics temperature stability requirements in an environment with highly dissipative items. On-ground, the potential occurrence of convection may also lead to a markedly different thermal performance than the gas conduction effects in microgravity or vacuum, requiringcorrelations between the cases to be known. These effects must be understood and characterised prior to passing the Aladin Qualification Review and for the successful operation of both of these payloads. This thesis addresses this need by numerically investigating the impact of convection and conduction of the gases on the thermal environment of the PLHs of Aladin, with applications to ATLID. Both parametric models were generated and the available reduced models of the Aladin PLH and its amplifiers modified {{to assess the impact of}} the gas on the laser diode stack, crystal slab and master oscillator bench temperatures. Simulations were run for the conditions of laboratory testing (101, 325 Pa) and vacuum testing (40 Pa) as well as for the in-orbit conditions of 40 Pa and zero gravity. Through these simulations, the performance of a new manual numerical techniques in ESATANto model the fluid is presented and verified by theoretical analyses in MATLAB and existing models in ANSYS. Experimental verification is anticipated to occur in the coming years or months as hardware testing resumes. The results demonstrate that the ICS has minimal detrimental effect on system performance and in many instances acts to thermally stabilise the system, enabling some strict requirements on the design to be relaxed. However, it was identified that there may be a critical issue resulting from contact conductance effects that warrants further investigation, particularly at the amplifier level.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Since 1980 s, the author’s {{impeller}} pump has successively achieved the device implantability, blood compatibility and flow pulsatility. In order to realize a performance durability, {{the author has}} concentrated in past years on solving the bearing problems of the {{impeller pump}}. Recent progress has been obtained in developing durable and permanent impeller blood pumps. At first, a durable impeller pump with rolling bearing and <b>purge</b> <b>system</b> has been developed, in which the wear-less rollers made of super-high-molecular weight polythene make the pump to work for years without mechanical wear; and the <b>purge</b> <b>system</b> enables the bearing to work in saline and heparin, and no thrombus therefore could be formed. Secondly, a durable centrifugal pump with rolling bearing and axially reciprocating impeller has been developed, the axial reciprocation of rotating impeller makes the fresh blood {{in and out of}} the bearing and to wash the rollers once a circle; in such way, no thrombus could be formed and no fluid infusion is necessary, which may bring inconvenience and discomfort to the receptors. Finally, a permanent maglev impeller pump has been developed, its rotor is suspended and floating in the blood under the action of permanent magnetic force and nonmagnetic forces, without need for position measurement and feed-back control. In conclusion, an implantable, pulsatile, and blood compatible impeller pump with durability may have more extensive applications than ever before and could replace the donor heart for transplantation in the future.

The port uses a fluid <b>purging</b> <b>system</b> to remove air from the instrument before insertion into the heart, and a valve system minimizes blood loss during instrument changes. ResultsThe cardioport was tested ex vivo and in vivo in pigs (n =  5). Beating-heart procedures, such as septal defect closure and mitral valve repair, were modeled.
