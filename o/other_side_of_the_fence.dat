5|$|Monti {{was born}} in Abington, Massachusetts, on September 20, 1975, to Paul, a school teacher, and Janet Monti. He grew up in Raynham, Massachusetts and, even as a child, he {{demonstrated}} the adventurous character that would later earn him the Medal of Honor. As a four-year-old, he disappeared from the backyard one day, and his mother found him later on hanging by the hood of his sweatshirt on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> On another occasion, a migraine headache kept him home from school, but he left the house and was later found climbing a tree. In 1994 he graduated from Bridgewater-Raynham Regional High School {{at the age of}} 18. Monti had two siblings, a sister, Nicole and a brother, Timothy.|$|E
5|$|On the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> the North Vietnamese transported and/or stored 70,000 tons of {{supplies}} in 3,000 trucks {{with a net}} loss of 13.5 percent during the year. During the same period about 80,000 PAVN troops made the trip south. A new North Vietnamese logistical effort, discovered by U.S. intelligence in late 1968, was a petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) pipeline running southwest from the North Vietnamese city of Vinh. By early the following year the pipeline had crossed the Laotian frontier and by summer it had reached Muong Nong and the approaches to the A Sáº§u Valley. The plastic line, assisted by numerous small pumping stations, could transfer diesel fuel, gasoline, and kerosene all in the same pipe.|$|E
25|$|A {{couple and}} their adult son and two adult daughters {{live in a}} fenced compound. The {{children}} {{have no knowledge of}} the outside world; their parents say they will be ready to leave once they lose a dogtooth, and that one can only leave safely by car. The children entertain themselves with endurance games, such as holding their hands under hot water. They believe they have a brother on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> to whom they throw supplies. The parents reward good behaviour with stickers and bad with violence.|$|E

25|$|The {{upper part}} of the fell, in excess of a mile square, is soft, peaty and drab. The {{exception}} is the ridge itself, which is considerably wetter. A fence runs along the ridge, a useful guide in mist and occasionally necessary for bog bouncing. The summit is set on a small rock platform with an Ordnance Survey column. A rocky knoll (called Man) stands on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> The views are extensive due to the central location and a lack of higher neighbours. The Helvellyn range is seen end to end, together with a panorama of high fells {{on the other side of}} the ridge from Crinkle Crags in the south to Blencathra in the north.|$|E
500|$|The bridge section has {{the girls}} laying in water while snow starts to fall. At the last {{portion of the}} chorus, t.A.T.u. are portrayed {{pointing}} in different directions, until they both walk around corner and see a vast field, where the sun is breaking out of the clouds; they clasp hands and walk off into the distance. The people on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> are left in an eerie green light with rain falling steadily; it is also revealed {{that they are the}} ones isolated behind the fence. The video's final scene shows the girls walking further in the distance. Several frames from [...] "Ya Soshla S Uma" [...] did not appear in the visual for [...] "All the Things She Said" [...] due to lip-syncing issues. Like [...] "All the Things She Said", the video generated controversy for having the duo kissing, with critics particularly believing that it prompted paedophilia and lesbianism. An editor from The Age commented that the impact of the video for [...] "Ya Soshla s Uma" [...] was generally lukewarm.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his final}} college {{football}} game, {{he helped the}} Wolverines win back the Little Brown Jug that he had helped the Gophers secure from 1940-1942.

[...] Asked at the time about having the opportunity to battle for the Little Brown Jug from the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> Daley denied having qualms about playing his former teammates: [...] "It will have to be just another game. [...] I look at it just as though it were an intrasquad scrimmage. [...] There won't be any qualms about how hard I hit my teammates or how hard they hit me." [...] He did note, though, that he wanted his last college football game to be memorable: [...] "If {{this is going to be}} my last game, I'd really like it to be one I can remember." ...|$|E

2500|$|In late 1996 Shenhav {{published}} in Haaretz an article titled [...] "The Bond of Silence", which generated {{a great deal}} of reaction. He pointed to an [...] "inter-generational bond of silence between the ideological commissars of the formative years of Zionism ("the salt of the earth") and the contemporary intellectuals of the Israeli Left (also [...] "salt of the earth"). These two generations of Ashkenazi hegemony concur in their silence toward the [...] "Mizrahi problem". He also argued that [...] "denouncing the injustice done to the Palestinians does not endanger the status of our contemporary Ashkenazi intellectuals. It does not endanger their position as a hegemonic cultural group in Israeli society or as an economic class" [...] and that [...] "Dealing with the injustices inflicted on the Palestinians earns them laurels of humanism, the esteemed roles of slaughterers of sacred cows and seekers of peace, the badge of the rebel, and a catharsis in light of the crime of their parents' generation" [...] yet the Palestinian is marked as the [...] "Other", which can be kept on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> The Mizrahi Jews, on the other hand, [...] "cannot be turned into an [...] "other," [...] nor can they be cast beyond the fence; at most, one can construct detours to bypass development towns and poverty neighborhoods". Recognition of the injustices done to the Mizrahim will force the Israeli left to reform itself as well and to relinquish its hegemonic position. To avoid that, they created a taboo.|$|E
