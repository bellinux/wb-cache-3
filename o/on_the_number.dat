5|$|Although {{atherosclerosis}} {{occurs to}} a certain degree in all people, people with FH may develop accelerated atherosclerosis due to the excess level of LDL. The degree of atherosclerosis approximately depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of LDL receptors still expressed and the functionality of these receptors. In many heterozygous forms of FH, the receptor function is only mildly impaired, and LDL levels will remain relatively low. In the more serious homozygous forms, the receptor is not expressed at all.|$|E

Pearson was racing against Bobby Isaac and Buddy Baker {{at the end of}} the Winston 500 at Talladega Superspeedway when Jimmy Crawford spun into Isaac; Pearson won the race. He won later that season at the Firecracker 400, a race that he would win three straight times.|$|E

5|$|Baird's first {{press conference}} as a cabinet {{minister}} {{was held in}} July 1999, and was intended to highlight the Harris government's record in reducing the provincial welfare rolls. Baird told reporters that 15,000 people had left the system since the introduction of workfare, and used this figure {{to argue that the}} government's policy was a success. At the time, he lacked information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of workfare recipients who actually found jobs, and he also did not account for 40% of the welfare recipients who had been cut from the list. A number of media reports subsequently criticized both the principle and the implementation of workfare in Ontario.|$|E
5|$|Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of individuals, Waptia fieldensis {{constitutes}} about 2.55% of {{the total}} number of organisms recovered from the Burgess Shale, and 0.86% of the Greater Phyllopod bed. This makes them the third most abundant arthropods of the Burgess Shale (after Marrella and Canadaspis). The National Museum of Natural History alone houses more than a thousand specimens of the species from the Burgess Shale. Waptia fieldensis are often found disarticulated, with parts remaining in close proximity to each other.|$|E

5|$|For {{activities}} {{open to the}} public, such {{as community}} gatherings, school events, or trade shows, a police- or media-issued press pass may offer little advantage. Free or reduced-price admission, or guaranteed entry, can sometimes be arranged. The benefits may be more extensive, granting access to front-row seats or to press-only rooms. For sporting events, a press pass issued by a stadium grants access to the press box. Because open events are usually funded by paying attendees, the number of press passes may depend <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of tickets sold.|$|E
5|$|Grand Theft Auto clones offer {{players the}} ability to steal and drive a number of vehicles.

Reviewers have compared these games based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of vehicles they offer, with greater choice resulting in better reviews. Players can also use vehicles as weapons, either by driving into enemies, or by damaging the vehicle until it explodes. Some games allow vehicles to perform stunts. Games in the genre thus incorporate elements of driving simulation games. Some games even allow players to customize their vehicles.|$|E
