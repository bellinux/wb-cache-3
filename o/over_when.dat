5|$|In February 1991, Icke {{visited a}} pre-Inca Sillustani burial ground near Puno, Peru, where he felt {{drawn to a}} {{particular}} circle of waist-high stones. As {{he stood in the}} circle, he had two thoughts: that people would be talking about this in 100 years, {{and that it would be}} <b>over</b> <b>when</b> it rained. His body shook as though plugged into an electrical socket, he wrote, and new ideas poured into him. Then it started raining and the experience ended. He described it as the kundalini (a term from Indian yoga) activating his chakras, or energy centres, triggering a higher level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|In the match, Zimbabwe batted first, and {{the public}} at the ground {{were not aware of}} the protest until the 22nd <b>over,</b> <b>when</b> Flower came out to bat wearing a black armband. Olonga was also seen wearing a black armband on the Zimbabwe team balcony. The crowd of 4,000 at the ground were {{supportive}} of the protest, and a number of them made their own black armbands during the match. In the match itself, Flower scored 39, as Zimbabwe reached 340/2, and Olonga took 0/8 in 3 overs, as Zimbabwe won a rain-affected match by 86 runs (D/L method).|$|E
5|$|India {{remained}} unchanged {{from the side}} that played the semi-final, while Australia excluded Ian Harvey and brought back Damien Martyn into the side. Ganguly won the toss and elected to field first. Zaheer Khan opened the bowling for India along with Javagal Srinath. The Australian openers scored aggressively {{from the beginning of}} the innings as Khan conceded 15 runs in the first over. Gilchrist in particular hit both Khan and Srinath for many runs and reached his 50 from 40 balls. When Ganguly turned to his spin bowlers as early as the tenth over, Gilchrist slowed his scoring rate. In the fourteenth <b>over,</b> <b>when</b> Harbhajan Singh was brought back to bowl, Gilchrist (57 off 48 balls) tried to hit him over the mid-wicket, but was beaten by the ball's extra bounce and caught in the deep by Virender Sehwag. The pair had added 105 runs for the first wicket. Harbhajan struck again in the twentieth <b>over</b> <b>when</b> he dismissed Hayden (37 runs off 54 balls), leaving the score at 125 runs.|$|E

5|$|The Deltas are despondent, but Bluto rallies {{them with}} an impassioned, if {{historically}} inaccurate, speech ("Was it <b>over</b> <b>when</b> the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell no!"), and so they decide {{to take action against}} Wormer, the Omegas, and the college. They convert Flounder's damaged car into an armored vehicle and hide it inside a cake-shaped breakaway float in order to sneak into the annual homecoming parade. As they wreak havoc on the event, the futures of several of the student main characters are revealed using freeze-frame labels. Most of the Deltas become respectable professionals, while their adversaries suffer less fortunate outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} no further British {{operations}} in the region, the Mauritius campaign was not quite <b>over.</b> <b>When</b> news of the victory at Grand Port had reached France, there was pressure to resupply and reinforce the victorious squadron under Hamelin and a small squadron commanded by Commodore François Roquebert was ordered to sail for Isle de France. This squadron included three frigates: Renommée, Clorinde and Néréide and carried extensive stores to repair and rearm Hamelin's frigates. The journey from France to the Indian Ocean was a long one, {{and it was not}} until February 1811 that Roquebert's squadron arrived at Mauritius. Discovering that the island was in British hands, Roquebert attempted to return to France but was chased by the frigates stationed on Mauritius and captured at the Action of 20 May 1811. Only Clorinde escaped the British pursuit.|$|E
5|$|Butlin {{proposed}} a new holiday camp at Clacton-on-Sea in Essex in 1936. Both {{the council and}} the local association of hotels were against the idea, as were the boarding house keepers. To persuade them, Butlin took {{the members of the}} council to Skegness to see how the people there appreciated their holiday camp. The councillors were soon won <b>over</b> <b>when</b> they learnt that the local traders in Skegness had seen an initial dip in custom after its construction followed by a rise as campers had visited the town and seasonal workers had come to spend their pay. Once approved by the council, construction began and the camp opened in 1938.|$|E
25|$|England's chase was {{interrupted}} once by rain, after three <b>overs,</b> <b>when</b> they were eight for 0, but coming back {{they were set}} 200 to win in 33 overs. That was never possible – rain started again after three more <b>overs</b> – and <b>when</b> Andrew Strauss fell the umpires decided that play was no longer possible, and a no-result was declared.|$|R

5|$|Corporal Dwayne Hicks (Michael Biehn), Sergeant Apone's second-in-command, takes <b>over</b> <b>when</b> Apone {{and most}} of the Colonial Marines are {{captured}} by the Aliens and commanding officer Lieutenant Gorman is incapacitated. Hicks looks for options for holding out with the survivors of the Hadley's Hope colony until aid arrives, and he and Ripley bond when he teaches her to use a pulse rifle. He is one of four survivors of the military mission. As the survivors escape, Hicks is injured when a spray of acid blood from an Alien hits his chest and face. He is apparently killed during the crash of the Sulaco in Alien 3, after which a body impaled on a broken support brace is found in his cryochamber. In the video game , Hicks is revealed to be alive and was actually kidnapped by mercenaries working for the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. His body is replaced by an anonymous victim to cover up the kidnapping, and he is rescued by Colonial Marines.|$|E
5|$|Day of the Tentacle {{features}} a four-minute long animated opening credit sequence, the first LucasArts game to have such. Ahern noted that their previous games would run the credits over primarily still shots which would only {{last for a}} few minutes, but with Tentacle, the team had grown so large that they worried this approach would be boring to players. They assigned Kyle Balda, an intern at CalArts, to create the animated sequence, with Chan helping to create minimalist backgrounds {{to aid in the}} animation. Originally this sequence was around seven minutes long, and included the three characters arriving at the mansion and releasing Purple Tentacle. Another LucasArts designer, Hal Barwood, suggested they cut it in half, leading to the shortened version as in the released game, and having the player take <b>over</b> <b>when</b> they arrive at the mansion.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs {{joined the}} Corps in October 1916 as an air {{mechanic}} and after training was posted to London, then Norfolk; {{at first he}} had time to appear in charity cricket matches and in several games for Idle. In November 1917, he joined 110 Squadron which remained in England despite plans to send it to France. By 1918, the cricket authorities began to arrange more matches and Hobbs played successfully several times at Lord's. In September 1918, 110 Squadron, as part of the newly formed Royal Air Force (RAF), was sent to France and took an active part in the fighting, but Hobbs never discussed his career in the RAF. Even so, some of his family remained critical and felt that the worst of the war was <b>over</b> <b>when</b> Hobbs went to France. He was demobilised in February 1919.|$|E

When he goes to the DMV with Marge to apply for one, Patty and Selma are his evaluators. The two mercilessly fail his driving and written test. The two light up {{cigarettes}} and are spotted by their supervisor, who informs them that smoking on the job is an offense which could cost them both their promotions. After being persuaded by Marge, Homer reluctantly covers for them by claiming the cigarettes as his own, thus clearing his debt to Patty and Selma.|$|E
5|$|In 1915 Walter Loving sought, and was granted, {{a medical}} {{disability}} due to worsening tuberculosis. He was replaced {{as director of}} the band by Pedro B. Navarro. Navarro had been with the PC Band since 1902, served as Loving's assistant conductor since 1904, and took <b>over</b> <b>when</b> Loving fell ill during the 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition. He was succeeded by José Silos in 1918. During this period the quality of the band suffered and, in 1920, Loving returned to the Philippines to rebuild the group. As part of his long-term plan to ensure the future stability of the band, he hand-picked bandsman Alfonso Fresnido to succeed him. Fresnido was sent to Ohio to study conducting at the Dana Music Institute (now the Dana School of Music at Youngstown State University) before returning to take over the band from Loving, who retired a second time in 1923.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Vietnam was {{estimated}} to have about 100,000 troops in Kampuchea, but, sensing that a diplomatic settlement was within reach, the Vietnamese Government began withdrawing forces in earnest. Between April and July 1989, 24,000 Vietnamese soldiers returned home. Then, between 21 and 26 September 1989, after suffering 15,000 soldiers killed and another 30,000 wounded during the 10-year occupation, Vietnam’s commitment to Kampuchea was officially <b>over,</b> <b>when</b> the remaining 26,000 Vietnamese soldiers were pulled out. However, armed resistance groups opposed to the Vietnamese-installed PRK regime claimed that Vietnamese troops were still operating on Kampuchean soil long after September 1989. For example, non-communist groups engaging in land-grab operations in western Kampuchea after the withdrawal reported clashes with elite Vietnamese Special Forces near Tamar Puok along Route 69. Then, in March 1991, Vietnamese units {{were reported to have}} re-entered Kampot Province to defeat a Khmer Rouge offensive. Despite such claims, on 23 October 1991, the Vietnamese Government signed the Paris Peace Agreement, which aimed to restore peace in Kampuchea.|$|E

5|$|Several of {{the events}} during the Royal Rumble match led to feuds and {{pay-per-view}} matches later in 1994. Diesel's performance in the Royal Rumble match led to him becoming an up and comer in the WWF pecking order and he became the Intercontinental Champion shortly after WrestleMania X with assistance from Shawn Michaels. The duo later won the WWF Tag Team Championship the night before SummerSlam in August. At SummerSlam, however, Michaels cost Diesel the Intercontinental Championship by inadvertently kicking him when Razor Ramon ducked out of the way. Finally, at Survivor Series in November, the still-simmering {{tension between the two}} friends boiled <b>over</b> <b>when</b> Michaels hit Diesel with another kick intended for Razor during their Survivor Series elimination match. Diesel became irate and chased after Michaels, who escaped in a car and declared their friendship and team over.|$|E

Meanwhile, Roxas, Sora's Nobody, is trapped in a virtual simulation of Twilight Town, created by DiZ to merge Roxas with his original self to restore Sora's power. DiZ's plans are threatened when Nobodies led by Axel, Roxas's former friend in Organization XIII, infiltrate the virtual town. However, Roxas is able to repel the Nobodies and finally merges with Sora. Sora, Donald, and Goofy wake up in the real Twilight Town and meet King Mickey and Yen Sid, who send them on another journey. Their goal is to find Riku and figure out the plans of Organization XIII, who control the Nobodies—the empty shell left <b>over</b> <b>when</b> a person with a strong heart is turned into a Heartless.

5|$|The French {{hoped that}} Julius III would be {{hostile to the}} {{interests}} of the Holy Roman Empire. Nevertheless, tensions between him and the French boiled <b>over</b> <b>when</b> he reconvened the Council of Trent in November 1550, culminating in the threat of schism in August 1551 and the brief War of Parma fought between French troops allied with Ottavio Farnese and a papal-imperial army. French prelates did not attend the 1551–1552 sessions of the Council of Trent and were slow to accept its reforms; because Henry II would not allow any French cardinals to reside in Rome, many missed the election of Pope Marcellus II, arriving in Rome just in time to elect Marcellus II's successor Pope Paul IV after Marcellus II's brief reign.|$|E

5|$|The libertines' {{downfall}} {{began with}} the February 1555 elections. By then, many of the French refugees had been granted citizenship and with their support, Calvin's partisans elected {{the majority of the}} syndics and the councillors. On 16 May the libertines took to the streets in a drunken protest and attempted to burn down a house that was supposedly full of Frenchmen. The syndic Henri Aulbert tried to intervene, carrying with him the baton of office that symbolised his power. Perrin seized the baton and waved it over the crowd, which gave the appearance that he was taking power and initiating a coup d'état. The insurrection was soon <b>over</b> <b>when</b> another syndic appeared and ordered Perrin to go with him to the town hall. Perrin and other leaders were forced to flee the city. With the approval of Calvin, the other plotters who remained in the city were found and executed. The opposition to Calvin's church polity came to an end.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners' {{day began}} at 4:30 am (an hour later in winter) with morning roll call. Dr. Miklós Nyiszli {{describes}} roll call as beginning 03:00 and lasting four hours. The weather was cold in Auschwitz {{at that time}} of day, even in summer. The prisoners were ordered to line up outdoors in rows of five and had to stay there until 07:00, when the SS officers arrived. Meanwhile, the guards would force the prisoners to squat for an hour with their hands above their heads or levy punishments such as beatings or detention for infractions such as having a missing button or an improperly cleaned food bowl. The inmates were counted and re-counted. Nyiszli describes how even the dead had to be present at roll call, standing supported by their fellow inmates until the ordeal was <b>over.</b> <b>When</b> he was a prisoner in 1944–45, five to ten men were found dead in the barracks each night. The prisoners assigned to Mengele's staff slept in a separate barracks and were awoken at 07:00 for a roll call that only took a few minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{weather was}} fine as Australia started their second innings just after noon. From the second {{ball of the}} innings, bowled by Bedser, Barnes got off the mark to avoid his pair. Coxon took the new ball {{at the other end}} and Barnes and Morris saw it off. In {{contrast}} to their English counterparts, the Australian opening pair took a cautious approach to begin with, avoiding the hook shot and not playing at balls that were not going to hit the stumps and established a solid start for themselves. Yardley then introduced Laker, who induced Morris to hit a ball back down the pitch in the air, but the bowler was slow to react to the possibility of a caught and bowled. According to O'Reilly, most other bowlers {{would have been able to}} reach the ball and attempt a catch. Barnes survived a missed stumping opportunity from Laker in the same <b>over</b> <b>when</b> he was on 18; he came down the pitch and the ball bounced out of the footmarks and narrowly missed leg stump, but Evans fumbled it, and it went away for four byes.|$|E
