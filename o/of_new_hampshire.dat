5|$|The Abbey Shield was {{designed}} by Pierre de Chaignon la Rose of Harvard University. It incorporates the personal coat of Saint Anselm of Canterbury and the first seal of the state <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire.</b> In 1927, by a monastic vote, the shield design was incorporated as the official shield of Saint Anselm Abbey and the college. The drops in each quadrant represent the three drops of blood on Anselm's coat of arms, and the sheaf of five arrows is taken from the first shield of the State <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire,</b> representing the five original counties of the state. Hence, the Abbey Shield has been interpreted as Saint Anselm <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire.</b>|$|E
