5|$|Hualālai last {{erupted in}} 1801. A severe {{earthquake}} swarm shook the volcano in 1929, lasting about a month.

40|$|Aim of study: The main aims of {{this study}} were <b>to</b> {{determine}} <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> level <b>to</b> residual stand and soil disturbance from mechanized selection logging. Area of study: Mixed beech stands in Caspian forests, northern Iran. Material and methods: Point-transect and systematic plot sampling were used for assessing <b>damages</b> <b>to</b> soil and trees, respectively. Main results: 89 % of forest soil area was undisturbed or shallow disturbed, and 5. 2 % was deep disturbed. Soil bulk density of top 10 cm in the winching corridors, ruts and skid trails were increased 10. 7 %, 20. 6 % and 32. 1 % respectively than controlled area. Frequency <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> <b>to</b> regeneration and trees were 12 % and 11. 2 %. The frequency <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> <b>to</b> regeneration was increased with increasing of their heights, but frequency <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> <b>to</b> trees was decreased with increasing of their diameter. The most type <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> was bole wounds in sizes of 100 to 200 cm 2 within 1 m from the ground level, and deep wounds. The frequency <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> was different in tree species (p = 0. 001). The mean size of bole wounds was 174 cm 2, and the mean height of bole wounds was 70 cm from ground level. The intensity of wounds on trees bole were decreased with increasing of their heights from ground level (p = 0. 02), while their sizes were increased (p = 0. 001). Research highlights: Winching of logs was the main cause <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> <b>to</b> soil and residual stand. The detailed planning strategy will reduce <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> level which is acceptable and predictable...|$|R

Major effects <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> the vagus nerve may include a rise in blood pressure and heart rate. Isolated dysfunction of only the vagus nerve is rare, but can be diagnosed by a hoarse voice, due to dysfunction of one of its branches, the recurrent laryngeal nerve.|$|E

5|$|The {{storm surge}} flooded Fells Point and the Inner Harbor of Baltimore, causing {{millions}} of dollars <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> waterfront properties. As the Inner Harbor began to flood, boat owners helped evacuate 35people in flooded homes. Winds from Isabel destroyed at least three buildings in the city. The Baltimore Museum of Industry alone suffered $1.5million in damage (2003USD, ($ USD). 70,000 were left without power in the city.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} to brain {{function is to}} examine the consequences <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> specific brain areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.|$|E
5|$|As the {{radiation}} sources can be precisely positioned at the tumour treatment site, brachytherapy enables a high {{dose of radiation}} {{to be applied to}} a small area. Furthermore, because {{the radiation}} sources are placed in or next to the target tumour, the sources maintain their position in relation to the tumour when the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body. Therefore, the radiation sources remain accurately targeted. This enables clinicians to achieve a high level of dose conformity – i.e. ensuring the whole of the tumour receives an optimal level of radiation. It also reduces the risk <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> healthy tissue, organs or structures around the tumour, thus enhancing the chance of cure and preservation of organ function.|$|E

However, M-21 had attempted to fire its two torpedoes, but failed because <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> the bow either from HMAS Yandras ramming or depth charges, or a possible collision with USS Chicago, making it possible that M-21 attempted to attack the cruiser. The observer aboard Canberra may have seen bubbles from the compressed air released to fire the torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|Cells {{exposed to}} {{ionizing}} radiation, ultraviolet light or chemicals {{are prone to}} acquire multiple sites of bulky DNA lesions and double-strand breaks. Moreover, DNA damaging agents can damage other biomolecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and RNA. The accumulation <b>of</b> <b>damage,</b> <b>to</b> be specific, double-strand breaks or adducts stalling the replication forks, are among known stimulation signals for a global response to DNA damage. The global response to damage is an act directed toward the cells' own preservation and triggers multiple pathways of macromolecular repair, lesion bypass, tolerance, or apoptosis. The common features of global response are induction of multiple genes, cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of cell division.|$|E

The deadliest tropical disturbance of the season was Tropical Depression 10F, which was responsible for eleven deaths and caused $ (2004USD; $ USD) in damage.

5|$|Historical data {{prior to}} 1700 is sparse {{due to lack}} of {{significant}} European settlements along the coastline; the few storms listed are largely records from Roanoke Colony and later the Province of Carolina.

One theory explaining the disappearance of Roanoke Colony suggests a hurricane destroyed the village, though {{there is no evidence to}} prove the theory. It is considered unlikely due to lack <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> a fence around the village, on which the villagers left an inscription.|$|E
