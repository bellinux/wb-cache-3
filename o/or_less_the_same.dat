5|$|Igneous {{activity}} {{associated with}} this stretching occurred from 12million to 4million years ago. Sedimentation is concentrated in valleys (basins) from material eroded from adjacent ranges. The amount of sediment deposited has roughly kept up with this subsidence, resulting in retention of more <b>or</b> <b>less</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> valley floor elevation over time.|$|E
5|$|When the Portuguese {{took over}} {{parts of the}} country after their arrival in 1505, they {{maintained}} more <b>or</b> <b>less</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> administrative structure followed by Sri Lankan rulers. During the Dutch rule in the country, the terrain under their control was divided into three administrative divisions. These were subdivided into disavas as in earlier systems. The British initially continued this system, but following reforms in 1796 to 1802, the country was divided according to ethnic composition. This was abolished by the Colebrook–Cameron reforms in 1833 and a legislative council was created, making the island a politically and administratively single unit. Five provinces were created, later expanded into nine, and these were subdivided into twenty-one districts. These districts were administered by officials known as Government Agents or Assistant Government Agents.|$|E
5|$|In frogs, the {{hind legs}} {{are larger than}} the fore legs, {{especially}} so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming. In the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large, and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies. The feet have adaptations for the way of life, with webbing between the toes for swimming, broad adhesive toe pads for climbing, and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging (frogs usually dig backwards into the soil). In most salamanders, the limbs are short and more <b>or</b> <b>less</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> length and project at right angles from the body. Locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings {{from side to side}} or is used as a prop, particularly when climbing. In their normal gait, only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors, the lobe-finned fish. Some salamanders in the genus Aneides and certain plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs, large toepads and prehensile tails. In aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles, the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion. Adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones.|$|E

25|$|Light rail {{is similar}} to the British English term light railway, long-used to {{distinguish}} railway operations carried out under a less rigorous set of regulation using lighter equipment at lower speeds from mainline railways.

In other words, the Shahnameh itself {{has become one of the}} main pillars of the modern Persian language. Studying Ferdowsi's masterpiece also became a requirement for achieving mastery of the Persian language by subsequent Persian poets, as evidenced by numerous references to the Shahnameh in their works.|$|E
