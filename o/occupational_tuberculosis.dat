40|$|Abstract Objective: {{to analyze}} the {{feasibility}} of quality indicators for evaluation of hospital programs for preventing <b>occupational</b> <b>tuberculosis.</b> Method: a descriptive cross-sectional study. We tested indicators for evaluating <b>occupational</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> prevention programs in six hospitals. The criterion to define feasibility was the time spent to calculate the indicators. Results: time spent to evaluate the indicators ranged from 2 h 52 min to 15 h 11 min 24 sec. The indicator for structure evaluation required less time; the longest time was spent on process indicators, including the observation of healthcare workers' practices {{in relation to the}} use of N 95 masks. There was an hindrance to test one of the indicators for tuberculosis outcomes in five situations, {{due to the lack of}} use of tuberculin skin test in these facilities. The time requires to calculate indicators in regarding to the outcomes for <b>occupational</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> largely depends upon the level of organizational administrative structure for gathering data. Conclusions: indicators to evaluate the structure for <b>occupational</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> prevention are highly feasible. Nevertheless, the feasibility of indicators for process and outcome is limited due to relevant variations in administrative issues at healthcare facilities...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{retrospective}} {{investigation was}} made to compare the occupational risk of tuberculosis in personnel assisting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected and uninfected subjects with active tuberculosis. DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed 6 years of hospital activity in 3 units where HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis are hospitalized and in 2 units where non-HIV-infected tuberculosis patients are hospitalized. The risk of <b>occupational</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> in healthcare workers who assisted HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis was investigated. PARTICIPANTS: The risk of <b>occupational</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> in healthcare workers was studied by considering the numbers of potential source cases (hospitalized patients with tuberculosis) in the two conditions investigated (HIV-positive and HIV-negative). Both potential source cases and cases of tuberculosis in healthcare workers had to be microbiologically proven {{in order to be}} considered. RESULTS: Seven cases of tuberculosis occurred in persons who cared for 85 HIV-infected subjects with tuberculosis, while only 2 cases occurred in staff members who took care of 1, 079 HIV-negative tuberculosis patients over the same period (relative risk = 44. 4; 95...|$|E

30|$|<b>Occupational</b> latent <b>tuberculosis</b> {{infection}} (LTBI) among {{health care}} workers (HCWs) is an important public health issue. World Health Organization (WHO) estimate of tuberculosis incidence of Japan in 2011 was 20 per 100, 000 population per year. The Tuberculosis Surveillance Center of The research institute of Tuberculosis, Japan Anti-tuberculosis Association reported the incidence of tuberculosis of Japan was 18.2 in 2010 and 17.7 in 2011 (Rates per 100, 000) and had continued to decline. However, approximately 80 % of nurses with tuberculosis were speculated to be infected by nosocomial infection in Japan (Ohmori et al. 2007). The screening for LTBI {{by means of the}} tuberculin skin test (TST) or whole blood interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) and the administration of chemoprophylaxsis {{have been shown to be}} effective for prevention to develop active tuberculosis (Ringshausen et al. 2012; Pai et al. 2004). In Japan, TST use is limited for screening of LTBI, because most Japanese residents have received bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination on multiple occasions. Accordingly, The Japanese Society of Tuberculosis recommend the Quantiferon®-TB Gold (QFT-G) test for the screening of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) infection for HCWs or health care students (Hotta et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|To {{estimate}} {{the incidence of}} and assess risk factors for <b>occupational</b> Mycobacterium <b>tuberculosis</b> transmission to health care personnel (HCP) in 5 New York City and Boston health care facilities, performance of prospective tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) was conducted from April 1994 through October 1995. Two-step testing was used at the enrollment of 2198 HCP with negative TST results. Follow-up visits were scheduled for every 6 months. Thirty (1. 5 %) of 1960 HCP with 1 follow-up evaluation had TST conversion (that is, an increase in TST induration of 10 mm). Independent risk factors for TST conversion were entering the United States after 1991 and inclusion in a tuberculosis-contact investigation in the workplace. These findings suggest that oc-cupational transmission of M. tuberculosis occurred, as well as possible nonoccupational transmission or late boosting among foreign-born HCP who recently entered the United States. These results demonstrate the difficulty in interpreting TST results and estimating conversion rates among HCP, especially when large proportions of foreign-born HCP are included in surveillance.

Aim: To assess the reactivity of tuberculin test and risk of M. tuberculosis infection among healthcare professionals working in an upright building, in which a TB Reference Clinic is placed. Subjects and Methods: A tuberculosis Skin Test (TST) was done to 251 staff members of a TB clinic that did not have a previous history or suspicion of TB and that did not have a previous TST done. Among subjects with absence of reaction, repeated tests were carried out to assess booster reaction. Results: Fifty one percent of studied subjects (129) had a positive tuberculin test. The booster phenomenon was evidenced in 35. 7 % (68 / 190). The seroconversion among non-reactive subjects, subjected to a new TST after one year, was 5. 1 %. The infection risk was 1. 4.

40|$|In a low-incidence setting, {{health care}} workers (HCW) are at {{a higher risk of}} {{tuberculosis}} than the general population.

The aim {{of this study was to}} identify additional biomarkers in order to overcome the limits of gamma interferon (IFN-) release assays (IGRAs) and improve the performance of LTBI diagnosis within this popula-tion. Seventy Bacille Calmette-Guérin-vaccinated HCW regularly exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis were grouped accord-ing to QFT results into an LTBI-positive group (positive QFT, n 8), an LTBI-negative group (normal QFT and negative tuber-culin skin test [TST], n 21), and an undetermined group (subpositive QFT and/or positive TST, n 41). The secretion of 22 cytokines in response to QFT-specific stimulation was quantified using a multiparameter-based immunoassay. As a result, thresholds discriminating LTBI-positive from LTBI-negative HCW were established by comparing areas under the receiver op-erating characteristic curves for interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), IL- 15, IFN [...] induced protein 10 (IP- 10), and the monokine induced by IFN- (MIG), which are biomarkers differentially secreted by the two groups. The combination of IL- 15 and MIG provided a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 94. 1 % in distinguishing LTBI-positive from LTBI-negative HCW. When using IL- 15 and MIG among the undetermined group, 6 / 45 HCW could be classified in the LTBI-positive group.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Occupational</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> (TB) in hospital-based {{health care}} workers is {{reported}} regularly, but TB in community-based health care researchers has not often been addressed. OBJECTIVE: To investigate TB incidence in health care researchers in a high TB and human immunodeficiency virus prevalent setting in the Western Cape, South Africa. The health care researchers were employed at the Desmond Tutu TB Centre, Stellenbosch University. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of routine information concerning employees at the Desmond Tutu TB Centre. The Centre has office-based and community-based employees. RESULTS: Of 180 researchers included in the analysis, 11 TB cases were identified over 250. 4 person-years (py) of follow-up. All cases were identified among community-based researchers. TB incidence was 4. 39 per 100 py (95 %CI 2. 45 - 7. 93). The standardised TB morbidity ratio was 2. 47 (95 %CI 1. 25 - 4. 32), which exceeded the standard population rate by 147 %.

Methods M. tuberculosis isolates were genotyped by IS 6110 RFLP analysis. Results of contact tracing and additional patient interviews were used for further epidemiological analyses. Results Out of 848 cases included in the cluster analysis, 286 (33. 7 %) were classified into 76 clusters comprising 2 to 39 patients. In total, two patients in the non-cluster and eight patients in the cluster group were health-care workers. Logistic regression analysis confirmed work in the health-care sector as the strongest predictor for clustering (OR 17. 9). However, {{only two of the}} eight transmission links among the eight clusters involving health-care workers had been detected previously. Overall, conventional contact tracing performed before genotyping had identified only 26 (25. 2 %) of the 103 contact persons with the disease among the clustered cases whose transmission links were epidemiologically verified. Conclusion Recent transmission was found to be strongly associated with health-care work in a setting with low incidence of TB. Conventional contact tracing alone was shown to be insufficient to discover recent transmission chains.

DesignProspective cohort analysis. Surveillance was conducted from January 1, 1988, to December 31, 2007. SETTING: 600 -bed tertiary referral hospital in Barcelona, Spain. ParticipantsHCWs in risk for <b>occupational</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> (TB) exposure, with negative baseline TST, direct contact with patients and/or biological samples {{and at least one}} follow-up visit with TST. MethodsTST is performed in HCWs with no previous history of TB or no previous positive TST. When TST is negative this test is performed once a year in high-risk workers, or at least every 2 years according to the hospital's guidelines. In all cases an interview questionnaire to gather information on possible risk factors was performed. ResultsThe study included 614 HCWs, 27 % worked in areas of risk for TB exposure. Annual incidence rate had decreased from 46. 8 per 100 person-years in 1990 to 1. 08 per 100 person-years in 2007. Cumulative incidence was higher in HCWs who work in high-risk areas (p =  0. 004) and in time periods from 1990 to 1995, and from 1996 to 2001 (p <  0. 0001).

We recruited a cohort of Canadian health care workers (HCWs) in Montreal, and performed both TST and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube (QFT) tests, and assessed risk factors and occupational exposure. In a cross-sectional analysis of baseline results, the prevalence of TST positivity using the 10 mm cut-off was 5. 7 % (22 / 388, 95 %CI: 3. 6 - 8. 5 %), while QFT positivity was 6. 2 % (24 / 388, 95 %CI: 4 - 9. 1 %). Overall agreement between the tests was poor (kappa= 0. 26), and 8. 3 % of HCWs had discordant test results, most frequently TST-/QFT+ (17 / 388, 4. 4 %). TST positivity was associated with total years worked in health care, non-occupational exposure to TB and BCG vaccination received after infancy or on multiple occasions. QFT positivity was associated with having worked as a HCW in a foreign country. Our results suggest that LTBI prevalence as measured by either the TST or the QFT is low in this HCW population. Of concern is the high frequency of unexplainable test discordance, namely: TST-/QFT+ subjects, {{and the lack of}} any association between QFT positivity and clear-cut recent TB exposure.

40|$|This article reconstructs how workers {{perceived}} asbestos hazards, using narratives from a {{group of}} migrant workers at the crocidolite mine of Wittenoom Gorge, Western Australia. The mine employed about 7000 workers over the entire period of its operation from 1943 to 1966 [...] relying heavily on migrant workers. The exposure to asbestos dust caused a huge number of occupational respiratory diseases in workers, leading Wittenoom later to be labelled as a modern industrial disaster. Fieldwork involved 137 interviews with Italians who had worked at Wittenoom. They constituted 18 % of the mine's work-force and were employed as miners or millers between 1951 and 1966. We interviewed workers who had returned to Italy, relatives of Italian workers now deceased, and workers who had settled in Australia. The results confirm the seriousness of the occupational exposure to asbestos and the weaknesses of the health surveillance program. Although workers were given no health-related information, they felt they were at risk and left the job as soon as possible. From the early 1950 s onward, some of the workers became aware of a long-term connection between work at Wittenoom and lung illnesses that required hospitalisation and caused deaths. However, up to the early 1960 s, workers at the mine were led to believe that the respiratory disease spreading among them was <b>tuberculosis.</b> <b>Occupational</b> hazards Mining Australia Social history Tuberculosis Memories of migration Narrative analysis...|$|R
40|$|SETTING: National {{household}} {{survey of}} adults in South Africa, a middle income country. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and predictors of chronic bronchitis. DESIGN: A stratified national probability sample of households was selected. All {{adults in the}} selected households were interviewed. Chronic bronchitis was defined as chronic productive cough. Socio-demographic predictors were wealth, education, race, age and urban residence. Personal and exposure variables included history of tuberculosis, domestic exposure to smoky fuels, occupational exposures, smoking and body mass index. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of chronic bronchitis was 2. 3 % in men and 2. 8 % in women. The strongest predictor of chronic bronchitis was a history of tuberculosis (men, odds ratio [OR] 4. 9; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 2. 6 – 9. 2; women, OR 6. 6; 95 %CI 3. 7 – 11. 9). Other risk factors were smoking, occupational exposure (in men), domestic exposure to smoky fuel (in women) and (in univariate analysis only) being underweight. Wealth and particularly education were protective. CONCLUSION: The pattern of chronic bronchitis in South Africa suggests a combination of risk factors that includes not only smoking but also <b>tuberculosis,</b> <b>occupational</b> exposures in men and domestic fuel exposure in women. Control of these risk factors requires public health action across a broad front. The protective role of education requires elucidation...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of diagnostic accuracy of new in vitro diagnostic assays for tuberculosis infection has been {{hampered by the}} lack of a standard reference test. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare sensitivity and specificity of interferon gamma assays for latent tuberculosis infection by assessing the association of test results with <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>occupational</b> exposure and by using latent class analysis. We analysed data from 115 healthcare workers on whom tuberculin skin test (TST) and the following in vitro tests were performed: in-house ELISPOT for RD 1 proteins, T. SPOT-TB and Quantiferon-TB Gold. Results of all tests were associated with increased occupational risk of exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but only TST was associated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination. Sensitivity/specificity (95 % confidence intervals) estimated by a latent class model were: 99. 9 %/ 64. 2 % (53. 0 - 74. 1) for TST, 95. 3 % (61. 8 - 99. 6) / 87. 5 % (78. 0 - 93. 2) for in-house ELISPOT, 96. 7 % (69. 3 - 99. 7) / 85. 6 %(75. 3 - 92. 0) for T. SPOT-TB, and 76. 3 % (55. 9 - 89. 1) / 93. 6 % (85. 4 - 97. 3) for Quantiferon. The estimated specificity of in vitro assays was higher than that of TST also among individuals who were not BCG-vaccinated. In conclusion, when used in healthcare workers, in vitro assays may provide a significant increase of specificity for tuberculosis infection compared to TST, even among non vaccinated individuals, at the cost of some sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the occupational risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection among healthcare workers (HCWs) {{and to examine}} the utility of tuberculin skin testing in a developing country with a high prevalence of bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination. DESIGN: Tuberculin skin test (TST) survey. SETTING: A tertiary-care referral center and a teaching hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. PARTICIPANTS: HCWs from medical, surgical, and orthopedic wards. INTERVENTION: Tuberculin purified protein derivative RT- 23 (State Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark) {{was used for the}} TST (Mantoux method). RESULTS: One hundred thirty-seven (52. 1) and 69 (26. 2) of the HCWs tested had indurations of 10 mm or greater and 15 min or greater, respectively. Medical ward HCWs were at significantly higher risk of a positive TST reaction than were surgical or orthopedic ward HCWs (odds ratio, 2. 18; 95 confidence interval, 1. 33 to 3. 57; P =. 002 for TST positivity at 10 mm or greater) (odds ratio, 2. 61; 95 confidence interval, 1. 44 to 4. 70; P =. 002 for TST positivity at 15 mm or greater). A previous TST was a significant risk factor for a positive TST reaction at either 10 mm or greater or 15 min or greater, but a duration of employment of more than 1 year and being a nurse were only significantly associated with a positive TST reaction at a cut-off point of 15 min or greater. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs at the University of Malaya Medical Centre had an increased risk for M. tuberculosis infection that was significantly associated with the level of <b>occupational</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> exposure. A TST cut-off point of 15 min or greater may correlate better with M. tuberculosis infection than a cut-off point of 10 min or greater in settings with a high prevalence of bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Occupational</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> (TB) {{continues}} to plague the healthcare workforce in South Africa. A 2 -year cluster randomized controlled trial was therefore launched in 27 public hospitals in Free State province, {{to better understand}} how a combined workforce and workplace program can improve health of the healthcare workforce. Objective: This mid-term evaluation aimed to analyze how well the intervention was being implemented, seek evidence of impact or harm, and draw lessons. Methods: Both intervention and comparison sites had been instructed to conduct bi-annual and issue-based infection control assessments (when healthcare workers [HCW] are diagnosed with TB) and offer HCWs confidential TB and HIV counseling and testing, TB treatment and prophylaxis for HIV-positive HCWs. Intervention sites were additionally instructed to conduct quarterly workplace assessments, and also offer HCWs HIV treatment at their occupational health units (OHUs). Trends in HCW mortality, sick-time, and turnover rates (2005 – 2014) were analyzed from the personnel salary database (‘PERSAL’). Data submitted by the OHUs were also analyzed. Open-ended questionnaires were then distributed to OHU HCWs and in-depth interviews conducted at 17 of the sites to investigate challenges encountered. Results: OHUs reported identifying and treating 23 new HCW cases of TB amongst the 1, 372 workers who used the OHU for HIV and/or TB services; 39 new cases of HIV were also identified and 108 known-HIV-positive HCWs serviced. Although intervention-site workforces used these services significantly more than comparison-site healthcare staff (p< 0. 001), the data recorded were incomplete for both the intervention and comparison OHUs. An overall significant decline in mortality and turnover rates was documented over this period, but {{no significant differences between}} intervention and comparison sites; sick-time data proved unreliable. Severe OHU workload as well as residual confidentiality concerns prevented the proper implementation of protocols, especially workplace assessments and data recording. Particularly, the failure to implement computerized data collection required OHU staff to duplicate their operational data collection duties by also entering research paper forms. The study was therefore halted pending the implementation of a computerized system. Conclusions: The significant differences in OHU use documented cannot be attributable to the intervention due to incomplete data reporting; unreliable sick-time data further precluded ascertaining the benefit potentially attributable to the intervention. Computerized data collection is essential to facilitate operational monitoring while conducting real-world intervention research. The digital divide still requires the attention of researchers along with overall infrastructural constraints...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{continuing}} worldwide {{increase in}} the incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has led to international initiatives to improve surveillance and identify preventable risk factors for this and related chronic lung diseases. The studies reported here aimed to examine the prevalence and risk factors for respiratory symptoms and COPD; to introduce and test surveillance methodologies; and to inform treatment and control measures for this disease. The Lung Health Survey 2002 sampled 3512 individuals aged ≥ 15 years from an urban population of 36, 334 in the predominantly low-income area of Ravensmead and Uitsig, Cape Town, South Africa. Information on respiratory symptoms, risk factors and healthcare utilisation was collected using a respiratory questionnaire which included questions that had been validated elsewhere. In 2005, a subsample of 960 persons aged ≥ 40 years participated in the Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease (BOLD) study comprised of a questionnaire and pre and postbronchodilator spirometry, in order to assess the prevalence of COPD. A high prevalence of respiratory symptoms of 38. 3 % was reported. Tobacco smoking showed a consistent positive association with chronic bronchitis, wheeze, dyspnoea and cough. Strong associations with cannabis smoking, pulmonary <b>tuberculosis,</b> <b>occupational</b> exposures and low socioeconomic status were found. The association of cannabis smoking with respiratory symptoms suggest that it may be a risk factor for COPD. The BOLD study revealed an exceptionally high prevalence of COPD in both men and women aged 40 years and older (29 % and 20 %, respectively) reflecting the very high prevalence of smoking in both sexes in the test area. The majority of those affected had moderate to severe disease, that is, symptoms with spirometric impairment (GOLD Stage II and higher). Even non-smoking women had a comparatively high prevalence of CO PO (12. 6 %), attributable to other risk factors such as <b>tuberculosis</b> and <b>occupational</b> exposures. Previous pulmonary tuberculosis was shown to be a strong predictor of COPD, which warrants further study. Review of healthcare utilisation confirmed significant under-recognition and under-treatment within local health services. These results confirm the need to prioritise preventative and treatment strategies for obstructive lung disease in South Africa...|$|R
40|$|HIV co-infection {{and drug}} {{resistance}} worsen {{the burden of}} Tuberculosis in South Africa. Infectious TB cases, often undiagnosed and untreated, are commonly found in health facilities increasing the likelihood of health-care associated TB. Health Care Workers (HCWs; and clients) are particularly at risk of TB infection in health care facilities; such risk characterises TB as a dual public health threat; first as a communicable disease and second as an <b>occupational</b> health hazard. <b>Tuberculosis</b> infection control (TBIC) measures may {{reduce the risk of}} TB transmission in health care settings, yet HCWs face challenges implementing TBIC measures. There is a gap in operational research seeking to understand the barriers to TBIC implementation among HCWs. There is, therefore, an urgent need to generate qualitative data, using a behavioural and sociological approach that provides insight to TBIC implementation challenges among HCWs. This case study research explored the barriers to TBIC implementation among HCWs in Khayelitsha clinics. Among professional and lay HCWs, data was collected by direct observation, interviews, focus group discussions and review of previous TBIC clinic assessment reports. The data was analysed using thematic analysis and interpretive analysis. This minor dissertation is in four parts. The protocol (Part A) presents the concept note of the study and its methodology. A structured literature review (Part B) provides a background and broadly reviews previous research and findings on Tuberculosis infection control. The journal ready article (Part C) presents the study findings, while Part D presents the study tools and related resources (appendices). Although most HCWs recognise the importance of TBIC in preventing health-care associated TB, they commonly believed that the TB transmission risk is only significant in clinic areas where known TB patients are found, and as such emphasise TBIC measures in those areas. Measures such as use of respirators and masks are mostly prioritized by HCWs ahead of administrative and environmental measures that are potentially more effective in reducing TB infection. Barriers to TBIC implementation identified include: inadequate HCW training on TBIC, a non-responsive compensation policy and the perception that a busy clinic schedule leaves no time for TBIC implementation. Resource availability, adequate human resources and leadership were further identified as enablers for TBIC implementation...|$|R
