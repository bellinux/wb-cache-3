40|$|In this paper, the {{approximation}} of the optimal compressor function using spline function <b>of</b> the <b>first-degree</b> is done. For the companding quantizer designed {{on the basis}} of the approximative spline function <b>of</b> the <b>first-degree,</b> the support region is numerically optimized to provide the minimum of the total distortion for the last segment. It is shown that the companding quantizer with the optimized support region threshold provides the signal to quantization noise ratio that is very close to the one of the optimal companding quantizer having an equal number of levels...|$|R

5|$|Despite her confession, Wise {{pleaded not}} guilty to the charge of murdering Lily Gienke in front of a grand jury on March 23, 1925. She told the grand jury that she was irresistibly {{attracted}} to attending funerals, and that when there were not enough funerals in the community, she was driven to create them by killing.

5|$|In October 1995, a Houston jury convicted Saldívar <b>of</b> <b>first-degree</b> {{murder and}} sentenced her {{to life in}} prison with the {{possibility}} of parole after 30 years in 2025. Life with the possibility of parole was the maximum prison term allowed in Texas that could be imposed at the time. In 2002, under a judge's order, the gun used to kill Selena was destroyed and the pieces were thrown into Corpus Christi Bay. Fans and historians disapproved of the decision to destroy the gun, saying the event was historical and the gun should have been in a museum.|$|E
40|$|Targeted {{screening}} by colonoscopy <b>of</b> asymptomatic <b>first-degree</b> relatives <b>of</b> {{patients with}} colorectal cancer (CRC) is promoted as a preventive health activity. This retrospective case control series details {{the results of}} this activity in a community-based referral gastroenterology practice. One advanced carcinoma and 22 adenomas in 15 patients were found in 118 individuals screened. Six per cent of those screened had advanced lesions (carcinoma, tubulovillous adenomas or adenomas larger than 1 cm). Colonoscopic screening <b>of</b> asymptomatic <b>first-degree</b> relatives <b>of</b> patients with CRC yields a limited number of clinically significant colonic neoplasms in this practice setting. Further cost-benefit data are needed...|$|R

5|$|Nichols stood trial twice. He {{was first}} tried {{by the federal}} {{government}} in 1997 and found guilty of conspiring to build {{a weapon of mass destruction}} and of eight counts of involuntary manslaughter of federal officers. After he was sentenced on June 4, 1998 to life without parole, the State of Oklahoma in 2000 sought a death-penalty conviction on 161counts <b>of</b> <b>first-degree</b> murder (160non-federal agent victims and onefetus). On May 26, 2004 the jury found him guilty on all charges, but deadlocked on the issue of sentencing him to death. Presiding Judge Steven W. Taylor then determined the sentence of 161consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole. In March 2005, FBI investigators, acting on a tip, searched a buried crawl space in Nichols' former house and found additional explosives missed in the preliminary search after Nichols was arrested.|$|E
5|$|The White Night riots were {{a series}} of violent events sparked by an {{announcement}} of the lenient sentencing of Dan White for the assassinations of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and of Harvey Milk, {{a member of the}} city's Board of Supervisors who was among the first openly gay elected officials in the United States. The events took place on the night of May 21, 1979 (the night before what would have been Milk's 49th birthday) in San Francisco. Earlier that day, White had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter, the lightest possible conviction for his actions. That White was not convicted <b>of</b> <b>first-degree</b> murder (of which he was originally charged) had so outraged the city's gay community that it set off the most violent reaction by gay Americans since the 1969 Stonewall Riots in New York City (which is credited as the beginning of the modern gay rights movement in the United States).|$|E
50|$|Both Golay and Rutterschmidt {{were convicted}} in Los Angeles, California, in April 2008, of {{conspiracy}} to murder Vados and McDavid, and <b>of</b> the <b>first-degree</b> murder <b>of</b> Vados. Golay was convicted <b>of</b> the <b>first-degree</b> murder <b>of</b> McDavid. Convictions on the several counts spanned a week, because one juror {{had to go}} on a trip and be replaced by an alternate. The original jury reached a deadlock over the final two counts against Rutterschmidt, but after the alternate juror was introduced the trial judge ordered the jury to recommence deliberations. Both women were sentenced to consecutive life terms in California Federal prison, without possibility of parole.|$|R

5|$|Upon her {{arrest on}} November 22, 1995, Green {{was charged with}} two counts <b>of</b> <b>first-degree</b> murder, two counts of {{attempted}} first-degree murder, and one count of aggravated arson. She was held on $3,000,000 bail—the highest ever required {{at that point in}} time by Johnson County, Kansas—and maintained her innocence throughout pre-trial motions and a show cause hearing. However, when the defense's own investigators verified the strength of forensic evidence against Green, she agreed to an Alford plea to all charges. On May 30, 1996, she was sentenced to two concurrent forty-year prison sentences. Green has petitioned for a new trial twice since her conviction. Her first request, which she eventually withdrew, was based on a claim of having been rendered incompetent for plea bargaining by the psychiatric medications she was taking at the time of her hearings; her second, which was denied by a judge, claimed that the evidence used to convict her of arson had been rendered obsolete by scientific advances.|$|E
25|$|On May 16, 2000, a {{grand jury}} in Alabama indicted Thomas Edwin Blanton and Bobby Frank Cherry with eight counts each <b>of</b> <b>first-degree</b> murder in {{relation}} to the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing.

40|$|The sera of 69 index coeliac patients, 121 <b>of</b> their <b>first-degree</b> relatives, and 104 {{controls}} were screened {{for the presence}} of reticulin antibodies.

40|$|AIMS: We {{sought to}} {{investigate}} {{the value of a}} family history of sudden death (SD) in Brugada syndrome (BS). METHODS AND RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty consecutive patients (mean age: 41 +/- 18 years, 168 males) with diagnostic type I Brugada ECG pattern were included. Sudden death occurred in 69 (43 %) of 157 families. One hundred and ten SDs were analysed. During follow-up VF (ventricular fibrillation) or SD-free survival rate was not different between patients with or without a family history of SD <b>of</b> a <b>first-degree</b> relative, between patients with or without a family history of multiple SD <b>of</b> a <b>first-degree</b> relative at any age and between patients with or without a family history <b>of</b> SD in <b>first-degree</b> relatives </= 35 years. One patient had family history of SD <b>of</b> two <b>first-degree</b> relative </= 35 years with arrhythmic event during follow-up. In univariate analysis male gender (P = 0. 01), aborted SD (P < 0. 001), syncope (P = 0. 04), spontaneous type I ECG (P < 0. 001), and inducibility during electrophysiological (EP) study (P < 0. 001) were associated with worse prognosis. The absence of syncope, aborted SD, spontaneous type I ECG, and inducibility during EP study was associated with a significantly better prognosis (P < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Family history of SD is not predictive for future arrhythmic events even if considering only SD in first-degree relatives or SD in first-degree relatives at a young age. The absence of syncope, aborted SD, spontaneous type I ECG, and inducibility during EP study is associated with a good five-year prognosis...|$|R
