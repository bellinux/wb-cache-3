6000|$|... "Oh, {{will you}} do that, Uncle Dunston?" [...] cried Laura, brightening, for she, {{as well as all}} <b>of</b> the <b>others,</b> <b>felt</b> sorry for Mrs. Breen, who seemed so poor, old, and lonesome.|$|R
30|$|Accounts {{revealed}} that although several participants experienced the CrossFit box as inclusive, a handful <b>of</b> <b>others</b> <b>felt</b> {{that the community}} was rather exclusive. Participants who experienced the box as inclusive spoke to {{the diversity of the}} membership and to the owner’s/coaches’ and members’ willingness to embrace people of all skill and athletic capabilities. Conversely, participants who experienced the box as exclusionary perceived the membership of the box to be homogeneous and/or did not feel welcomed in the space.|$|R
50|$|Though {{many did}} not like Harrelson’s {{verbosity}} and obvious hometown boosterism at the concluding moment <b>of</b> the game, <b>others</b> <b>felt</b> the outburst <b>of</b> emotion captured {{exactly what they were}} feeling as the perfect game was sealed.|$|R
6000|$|... "The major gave it {{you rather}} hotly, Dick," [...] Terence {{said to his}} friend, as they sauntered off {{together}} from the group. [...] "I am glad that you spoke first, for I had it {{on the tip of}} my tongue to say just what you did, and I expect that a good many <b>of</b> the <b>others</b> <b>felt</b> just the same." ...|$|R
5000|$|When MANAPO was {{dissolved}} {{in the beginning}} of the Second World War, with some of its members entering the ranks of the Communist Party <b>of</b> Yugoslavia, while <b>others</b> <b>felt</b> the aims <b>of</b> the organization had been established with the [...] "liberation" [...] of Vardar Macedonia by Bulgaria in 1941.|$|R
50|$|Wang Jingwei, {{who had a}} {{high fever}} at the time, was visited by Chen Gongbo; Tan Yankai, head of the 2nd Corps; Zhu Peide (3rd Corps); Li Jishen (4th Corps); and Song Ziwen, the {{minister}} of finance. Wang was indignant and some <b>of</b> the <b>others</b> <b>felt</b> Chiang was overreacting, but the Nationalist Executive Committee convened at the house on 22 March and a compromise was reached in which Wang would take a vacation abroad in the near future.|$|R
60|$|As a rule {{he seemed}} old for his years. He was so {{conscious}} <b>of</b> what <b>other</b> people <b>felt,</b> particularly his mother. When she fretted he understood, {{and could have}} no peace. His soul seemed always attentive to her.|$|R
50|$|Mann {{was one of}} the few {{publicly}} active {{opponents of}} Nazism among German expatriates in the U.S. While some Germans claimed after the war that in his speeches he had endorsed the notion <b>of</b> collective guilt, <b>others</b> <b>felt</b> he had been highly critical also of the politically unstable Weimar Republic that preceded the Third Reich.|$|R
6000|$|... "Won't {{you let me}} be of some use?" [...] {{he pleaded}} to the silent Razumov, who with {{his eyes on the}} ground and utterly unable to {{penetrate}} the real drift <b>of</b> the <b>other's</b> intention, <b>felt</b> a strange reluctance to clear up the point.|$|R
60|$|And before Ethel's eyes came {{a vision}} of poor Mrs. Ward leaning on her son's arm, on Saturday {{afternoon}} walks, each looking fond and proud <b>of</b> the <b>other.</b> She <b>felt</b> her own hardness of heart, and warmed to the desire of giving comfort.|$|R
60|$|When, after {{a careful}} survey <b>of</b> each <b>other,</b> they <b>felt</b> that their {{disguise}} was complete, they moved boldly forward, accompanied by James. After half an hour's walking they {{emerged from the}} forest, and the strong fort of Crown Point lay before them.|$|R
30|$|The {{first set}} of revised items (6 a- 6 d) deals with the parent’s {{perception}} of physical state of their child’s oral health. Some parents {{did not know how}} to report the color of their children’s teeth and were confused by “bright white”; a couple of parents had their children’s teeth brightened by dentists, but most <b>of</b> the <b>others</b> <b>felt</b> either “white” or “yellow” was more like the color; however, some had a brown tooth among the other colors. Given the option to include different colors seemed to solve the problem.|$|R
50|$|Works Volume 2 is {{the sixth}} studio album by Emerson, Lake & Palmer, {{released}} in 1977. Unlike Works Volume 1 (which {{consisted of three}} solo sides and one ensemble side), Works Volume 2 was a single album which seemingly was a compilation of leftover tracks from other album sessions that had not made those albums. While many derided the album for its apparent lack <b>of</b> focus, <b>others</b> <b>felt</b> that it showed a different side of the band, with blues, bluegrass and jazz being very prominent as musical genres in this recording.|$|R
25|$|MacHomer has {{received}} largely positive reviews from critics, with praise going to Miller's impersonations. However, some critics {{felt that the}} play seems more like a group <b>of</b> sketches, while <b>others</b> <b>felt</b> that Miller's Homer Simpson voice {{was one of his}} weaker impersonations. According to Miller, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening is a fan of the play and gave him permission to perform it.|$|R
50|$|The show did not {{generate}} as {{much interest}} {{as some of}} the earlier episodes. Part of it could be because the issue of casteism is not a topic unknown to most Indians. Some people alleged that the show generalised the entire Brahmin community <b>of</b> being casteist. <b>Others</b> <b>felt</b> the episode was long and the lack of intensity made for dull viewing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am in {{the same}} fix," [...] Furley admitted. [...] "I sat here till four o'clock. Phineas Cross came around, and half-a-dozen <b>of</b> the <b>others.</b> I <b>felt</b> I must talk to them, I must keep on {{hammering}} it out. We're right, Julian. We must be right!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{result of}} this remark was that the sailor-boy turned deadly pale, and stared at his little friend {{without being able to}} utter a word. Mere human nature taught Jacky that he had made a mistake in being so precipitate: but home {{education}} had not taught him to consider the feelings <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> He <b>felt</b> inclined to comfort his new friend, but knew not how to do it. At last a happy thought occurred to him, and he exclaimed eagerly-- ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} named after the band because it [...] "felt like what the band was meant to be". According to Tweedy the band [...] "struggled with a lot <b>of</b> <b>other</b> titles that <b>felt</b> more {{exemplary}} of what the music was. But nothing else felt quite so succinct." ...|$|R
50|$|The Rugby Labour {{party was}} split over Brown's candidature. Some members wanted {{to support him}} because he was a leading trade unionist and easily to the left <b>of</b> Holbrook, while <b>others</b> <b>felt</b> that it was {{important}} to follow the party leader, Clement Attlee, who had endorsed Holbrook. The National Council of Labour passed a resolution condemning Brown as a disruptive individual, not a fit and proper person to represent the working classes.|$|R
60|$|Mr Stevenson, {{coupling}} this {{smile on}} Ruby's {{face with the}} remarks <b>of</b> the <b>other</b> seamen, <b>felt</b> that things were not so bad as they appeared to unaccustomed eyes, nevertheless he deemed it right to advise with the master and officers as to the probable result, {{in the event of}} the ship drifting from her moorings.|$|R
30|$|In terms <b>of</b> <b>other</b> suggestions, Julian <b>felt</b> {{that more}} {{preparation}} and guidance were needed {{at the beginning}} of the humanitarian career and Emma argued that more creative thinking was required around how workers might be able to share jobs or alternate assignments to give them enough time to create and sustain a secure base somewhere.|$|R
50|$|Kean {{begins the}} chapter with the sad tale of George Dedlow. George Dedlow {{had fought in}} the Civil War and in turn had both his arms and both his legs amputated for various reasons. These amputations brought on another {{neurological}} phenomenon: phantom limbs. George Dedlow, amongst millions <b>of</b> <b>other</b> war amputees, <b>felt</b> pain in limbs {{that he did not}} have.|$|R
5000|$|In the Old Testament Klinkert used Allah as a {{translation}} for the singular Hebrew Elohim, and used , {{as well as}} , and [...] for plural gods. Klinkert made these theological decisions without a good knowledge of Hebrew. Klinkert knew that a good translation was only possible with the cooperation <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> but he <b>felt</b> easily insulted when others critiqued his work.|$|R
2500|$|Certain {{commentators}} specifically {{focused on}} the series' success or failure in achieving the high standards set by the critically acclaimed 1995 film Ghost in the Shell. Opinion in this regard was divided: although these reviewers took an overall favorable view, some reviews criticized the quality <b>of</b> animation, while <b>others</b> <b>felt</b> that the series' story lacked {{the depth of the}} original film. This [...] "lack of depth", however, was attributed to the fact that Stand Alone Complex is an action-oriented series with a limited episode length in which to explore deeper themes.|$|R
60|$|It was {{perfectly}} understood between Paul and Mr Toots, {{that they were}} intimate friends, notwithstanding their distance in point of years and station. As the vacation approached, and Mr Toots breathed harder and stared oftener in Paul's society, than he had done before, Paul knew that he meant he was sorry {{they were going to}} lose sight <b>of</b> each <b>other,</b> and <b>felt</b> very much obliged to him for his patronage and good opinion.|$|R
50|$|Green {{began work}} on the book in 1869, having been given only six months to live after being hit hard by disease that had plagued him {{throughout}} his life. Only having around 800 pages to write on, {{he had to leave}} out much of what he wanted to include. Green intentionally left out the battles of England feeling they did not play a big role {{in the formation of the}} nation. His new ideas, and omission <b>of</b> information that <b>others</b> <b>felt</b> important, meant Green was criticized by other historians as well as the people close to him.|$|R
50|$|From 1999 to 2002, {{she was the}} Special Adviser on Arts and Culture to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, a post she {{resigned}} from to seek election, along with a number <b>of</b> <b>other</b> writers who <b>felt</b> their inclusion in Nigerian politics would for the good. However, she lost the contest for the Orlu senatorial district seat of Imo State, and drew attention to irregularities and rigging.|$|R
50|$|Founded in 1988 by Linda Walsh {{with the}} {{assistance}} <b>of</b> <b>other</b> parents who <b>felt</b> {{there was a need}} for a specialised support group, DHG became a registered charity in 1992 and has continued to develop and grow according to the needs of its membership. Although UK based, the Group has contact with Down syndrome and congenital heart defect groups across the world, many of whom use and translate DHG's information sheets.|$|R
50|$|Eve {{suffered}} from low viewership {{in spite of}} its high ratings among young Hispanic women; it was canceled following UPN's merger with The WB Television Network (The WB) to launch The CW in 2006. The series' cancellation, along with that <b>of</b> <b>other</b> black sitcoms, was criticized by media outlets for reducing representation of African American characters and the number of roles for African American actors on television. Critical response to Eve was mixed; some praised its inclusion as a part of UPN's line-up <b>of</b> black sitcoms, <b>others</b> <b>felt</b> Eve lacked charisma, and that the series was inferior to other black sitcoms. Despite the negative reception, the show and Eve received several award nominations. The series was released on the iTunes Store and Amazon Video.|$|R
2500|$|Broader issues, both {{political}} and moral, troubled the developing movie industry. With {{the stock market crash}} in 1929, and general economic turbulence, many writers who had begun to question both the survival and moral basis <b>of</b> capitalism; <b>others</b> <b>felt</b> Marxism was the greater threat to a democratic society. Racial and religious discrimination had been institutionalized. Prohibition had empowered gangsters and made drinking chic. Reformists saw the silver screen as the perfect vehicle for presenting social issues. Others saw it as a canvas on which to display [...] "ARS GRATIA ARTIST" [...] Many outside of the film industry itself saw it as an entirely corrupting influence on society in need of regulation. Young Rowland Brown, arriving from the Midwest with a handful of one-act plays, just hoped to address those issues, all of them, with the tools he had at hand. He soon discovered the many impediments to doing so.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, {{the game}} sold only 4,805 copies during 1997. Critical {{reception}} of Incubation was mostly positive. PC Gamer's take was positive, awarding it {{the title of}} the Best Turn-Based Strategy Game <b>of</b> 1997. <b>Others</b> <b>felt</b> the game made some steps in the right direction but lacked the depth and challenge needed for a great strategy game. Writing for GameSpot, Greg Kasavin noted that [...] "most weapons at your disposal carry limited ammunition and can overheat rather quickly, forcing you to fire only when you must." [...] Niko Nirvi of Pelit, who initially considered the game a botched X-COM variant, came {{to think of it as}} a sort of puzzle game and was very taken with it. GamePro gave it 18 out of 20, commenting: [...] "Best of all, the game is both challenging and fun, proving that real-time strategy isn't always best. Incubation is definitely a winner." ...|$|R
6000|$|And then it {{gradually}} {{came home to}} both of them that this utter silence, this prostration of all power of self-management, told to each the secret <b>of</b> the <b>other.</b> Each <b>felt</b> that every moment of prolonged silence committed both of them the deeper. Why should not Adela be able to speak when thus informed of her neighbour's intended celibacy? Why should he sit like a fool before her merely because he had told her that on which he had long decided? ...|$|R
40|$|A {{meditation}} on how psychoanalysis, as the "only real {{discipline of the}} excessive," has an indispensable contribution to make in fathoming the "causeless hatred" of racism and bigotry that continues to plague the human species. Frosh cites both Lacan and Melanie Klein as theorists whose ideas seem so "breathtakingly mad" that their "continuing existence" can be explained only "as a sign or emblem of the wildness within," but he draws particularly {{on the work of}} Jean Laplanche and Judith Butler to propose that the <b>other</b> is formative <b>of</b> the subject, and hence should be accorded primacy both psychologically and ethically. Intriguingly, Frosh utilizes what might appear to be a relational premise to make a postmodernist argument that the consequent "ex-centric" location of psychic life enriches the subject but also-most notably under conditions of insecurity, oppression, and violence-creates an intense internal disturbance in which hatred <b>of</b> the <b>other,</b> <b>felt</b> to be entwined with the self, has a propensity to emerge...|$|R
5|$|Reaction to {{the utility}} by Doom9 forum members, bloggers, and {{mainstream}} media has ranged from supportive to intensely hostile. By some, the circumvention of AACS {{was seen as}} a reaffirmation <b>of</b> fair use. <b>Others</b> <b>felt</b> that the utility {{was no more than a}} piracy tool and would bring about group punishment against consumers in the form of player revocation. One article compared proponents of BackupHDDVD to terrorists. When the release of the tool was first publicized, several articles claimed that AACS had been cracked. In fact no cryptographic weaknesses constituting a crack have yet been found in AES, the underlying cryptographic system of AACS. Keys are actually obtained through a side-channel attack.|$|R
