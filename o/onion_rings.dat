5|$|Modern deep frying {{began in}} the 19th century with the growing {{popularity}} of cast iron, particularly around the American South which {{led to the development of}} many modern deep-fried dishes. French fries, invented in the late 18th century, became popular in the early 19th century western Europe. Doughnuts were invented in the mid-19th century, with foods such as <b>onion</b> <b>rings,</b> deep-fried turkey, and corn dogs all being invented in the early 20th century. In recent years, the growth of fast food has expanded the reach of deep-fried foods, especially French fries.|$|E
5|$|Although Wendy's was {{the first}} to have a value menu in 1989, Burger King decided to offer its own value menu in 1998. This menu {{featured}} seven products: the Whopper Jr., a five-piece Chicken Tenders, a bacon cheeseburger, medium-sized French fries, medium soft drink, medium <b>onion</b> <b>rings,</b> and a small milkshake – all priced at 99¢ (USD). In 2002 and 2006, BK revamped its value menu by adding and removing several products such as chili and the Rodeo Cheeseburger. Many of these items, such as Chili, tacos, the Sourdough burger (a product similar to the Whopper Jr., but with sourdough bread), and Chicken Tender sandwiches have since been discontinued, modified, or relegated to regional menu options.|$|E
5|$|Besides the Original Chicken sandwich, Burger King {{has sold}} or sells several other {{sandwiches}} {{that are similar}} to the Specialty Sandwiches. Several burgers have been sold on this family of sandwiches, including a pair of triple cheeseburgers called the Limo Burger and the X-Tra Long Cheeseburger, the Bull's-Eye Barbecue Burger which was a type of double cheeseburger that included two hamburger patties, American cheese, bacon and Kraft Bull's-eye brand barbecue sauce, and the BBQ Hero which was also another type of double cheeseburger with barbecue sauce, bacon, lettuce, tomato and onions. The company introduced another burger in this family called the Extra Long BBQ Cheeseburger in June 2014. The sandwich consisted of two burger patties, BBQ sauce and <b>onion</b> <b>rings.</b> It is similar in composition to the chain's Rodeo Cheeseburger.|$|E

5|$|Beyond French fries, {{the company}} has {{introduced}} several other side products {{over the course of}} its existence. <b>Onion</b> <b>rings</b> {{have been part of the}} menu for the majority of BK history. Originally made from whole, sliced onions, they were reformulated into a formed product made from onion paste in 2001 as part of a menu revamp. In the same 2001 menu revamp, the company added an onion ring-specific dipping sauce, and emphasized it again during its 99¢ BK Value Menu introduction in 2002. As part of its BK Cravers value menu introduction in 2005, the company briefly sold jalapeño poppers accompanied by a side of ranch dressing as part of its national menu. The same menu added mozzarella sticks with a side of marinara sauce; the mozzarella sticks have since been relegated to a regional menu item in the United States, but are sold on the national menu in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Onions are {{commonly}} chopped {{and used as}} an ingredient in various hearty warm dishes, and may {{also be used as}} a main ingredient in their own right, for example in French onion soup or onion chutney. They are versatile and can be baked, boiled, braised, grilled, fried, roasted, sautéed, or eaten raw in salads. Their layered nature makes them easy to hollow out once cooked, facilitating stuffing them, as in sogan-dolma. Onions are a staple in Indian cuisine, used as a thickening agent for curries and gravies. Onions pickled in vinegar are eaten as a snack. These are traditionally a side serving in pubs and fish and chip shops throughout the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. Pickled onions form part of a British pub ploughman's lunch, usually served with cheese and ale. In North America, sliced onions are battered, deep-fried, and served as <b>onion</b> <b>rings.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this {{investigation}} an attempt {{has been made}} to understand the mechanism of friction stir weld formation and the role of friction stir welding tool in it. This has been done by understanding the material flow pattern in the weld produced in a special experiment, where the interaction of the friction stir welding tool with the base material is continuously increased. The results show that there are two different modes of material flow regimes involved in the friction stir weld formation; namely “pin-driven flow” and “shoulder-driven flow”. These material flow regimes merge together to form a defect-free weld. The etching contrast in these regimes gives rise to <b>onion</b> <b>ring</b> pattern in friction stir welds.

40|$|Understanding the {{fundamentals}} of composting science from a pragmatic perspective of necessity involves mixtures of different sizes and types of particles in constantly changing environmental conditions, in particular temperature. The complexity of composting is affected by this environmental variation. With so much "noise" in the system, a question arises as {{to the need to}} understand the detail of this complexity as understanding any part of composting with more precision than this level of noise is not likely to result in greater understanding of the system. Yet some compost piles generate offensive odours while others don‟t and science should be able to explain this difference. A driver for this research was greater understanding of potential odour, which is assumed to arise from the anaerobic core of a composting particle. It follows that the size of this anaerobic core could be used as an indicator of odour potential. A first step in this understanding is the need to determine which parts of a composting particle are aerobic, from which the anaerobic proportion can be determined by difference. To this end, this thesis uses a finite volume method of analysis to determine the distribution of oxygen at sub-particle scales. Diffusion laws were used to determine the thickness of each finite volume. The resulting model, called micro-environment analysis, was applied to a composting particle to enable determination of <b>onion</b> <b>ring</b> type volumes of compost (called micro-environments) containing substrates (further subdivided into substrate fractions) whose concentrations could be determined to high precision by the application of first-order degradation kinetics to each of these finite volumes. Determination of the oxygen concentration at a micro-environment's inner boundary was achieved by using the Stępniewski equation. The Stępniewski model was derived originally for application to soil aeration and enables each micro-environment to have its own oxygen uptake rate and diffusion coefficient. This first version of micro-environment analysis was derived from the simpler solution to diffusion laws, based on the assumption of non-diffusible substrate. It was tested against three sets of experimental data with two different substrates: Particle size trials using dog sausage as substrate – where the peak composting rate was successfully predicted, as a function of particle size. Temperature trials using pig faeces and a range of particle sizes – the results showed the potential of micro-environment analysis to identify intriguing temperature effects, in particular, a different temperature effect (Q 10) and fraction proportion was indicated for each substrate fraction. Smaller particle sizes, and possibly outward diffusion of substrate confounded a clear experimental signal. Diffusion into a pile trials which showed that the time course of particles deeper in the pile could be predicted by the physics of oxygen distribution. A fully computed prediction would need an added level of computational complexity in micro-environment analysis, arising from there being two intertwined phases, gas phase and substrate (particle) phase. Each phase needs its own micro-environment calculations which can not be done in isolation from each other. Unexplainable parts of the composting time course are likely to be partly explained by the outward diffusion of substrate towards the inward-moving oxygen front. Although the possibility of alternative electron acceptors can not be discounted as a partial explanation. To test the theory, a new experimental reactor was developed using calorimetry. With an absolute sensitivity of 0. 132 J hr- 1 L- 1 and a measurement frequency of 30 minutes, the reactor was able to detect the energy required to humidify the input air, and "see" when composting begins to decline as oxygen is consumed. Optimisation of the aeration pumping frequency using the evidence from the data was strikingly apparent immediately after setting the optimum frequency. Micro-environment analysis provides a framework by which several physical effects can be incorporated into compost science...|$|R
