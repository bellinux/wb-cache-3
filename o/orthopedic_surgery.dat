5|$|There is no {{cure for}} polio. The focus of modern {{treatment}} has been on providing relief of symptoms, speeding recovery and preventing complications. Supportive measures include antibiotics to prevent infections in weakened muscles, analgesics for pain, moderate exercise and a nutritious diet. Treatment of polio often requires long-term rehabilitation, including occupational therapy, physical therapy, braces, corrective shoes and, in some cases, <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgery.</b>|$|E
5|$|Warfarin, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Coumadin among others, is a {{medication}} that is used as an anticoagulant (blood thinner). It is commonly used to treat blood clots such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and to prevent stroke in people who have atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease or artificial heart valves. Less commonly it is used following ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgery.</b> It is generally taken by mouth but may also be used by injection into a vein.|$|E
5|$|Acquired {{risk factors}} include the strong risk factor of older age, which alters blood {{composition}} to favor clotting. Other important acquired risk factors include major surgery and trauma, {{both of which}} may increase the risk because of tissue factor from outside the vascular system entering the blood. In <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgery,</b> venous stasis may be temporarily provoked by a cessation of blood flow {{as part of the}} procedure. Cancer can grow in and around veins, causing venous stasis, and can also stimulate increased levels of tissue factor. Pregnancy causes blood to favor clotting, and in the postpartum, placental tearing releases substances that favor clotting. Oral contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy increase the risk through a variety of mechanisms, including altered blood coagulation protein levels and reduced fibrinolysis.|$|E

5|$|Callie Torres is {{introduced}} as an <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgery</b> resident with {{a crush on}} intern George O'Malley (T.R. Knight). The two start a relationship and Torres moves into Meredith's house (Meredith and Izzie Stevens lived there as well). Uneased at the way their relationship is progressing, O'Malley confronts her, which results in her moving into a hotel. In {{the aftermath of the}} breakup, she meets and has a one-night stand with plastic surgeon Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), who becomes her friend. Torres and O'Malley subsequently reconcile, and the two marry in Las Vegas {{on the spur of the}} moment. Confused, O'Malley confides to fellow intern Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), about his relationship woes over alcohol, leading to a drunken sexual encounter between the two. Torres remains unaware of his sexual encounter, but becomes increasingly suspicious, and announces her desire to conceive a child. Shortly thereafter, however, she discovers that O'Malley has been unfaithful, ending their marriage. Though her personal life is troubled, Torres thrives professionally when she is appointed as the hospital's Chief Resident. However, she soon begins struggling to cope in the role, and is demoted soon thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The series follows Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), the {{daughter}} of an esteemed general surgeon named Ellis Grey, following her acceptance into the residency program at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital. During her time as a resident, Grey works alongside fellow doctors Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), and George O'Malley (T. R. Knight), who each struggle to balance their personal lives with the hectic work and training schedules. They are overseen during their internship by Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), a senior resident who works for attending Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), the head of neurosurgery and Meredith's love interest; Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington), the head of cardio who becomes Yang's fiancee; and Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), the Chief of Surgery and attending general surgeon, and lover of Ellis Grey decades ago. The residents are later joined by Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams) and April Kepner (Sarah Drew), former Mercy-West residents who join Seattle Grace following an administrative merger in the sixth season. Throughout the first six seasons, Burke, O'Malley and Stevens all depart the series. In addition to Webber, Burke, and Shepherd, the surgical wing is primarily supervised by Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), as head of OB/GYN, neonatal, and fetal surgery; Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), a resident who later becomes head of <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgery,</b> who left Seattle {{at the end of the}} twelfth season; Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), as head of plastics; Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), as head of trauma; Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), as head of pediatric surgery, and later head of fetal surgery; Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), as head of cardio; Teddy Altman (Kim Raver), as head of cardio; and Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone), Derek's sister who is hired to replace him as head of neuro.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: As of 2010, 5. 3 million <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgeries</b> are {{performed}} each year, and this number {{is expected to}} increase to 6. 2 million by 2020. On average, 27. 7 % of all <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgeries</b> result in infection which often leads to osteomyelitis and the loss of supporting bone. In this study, we describe two synthetic bone grafts, or augmentation methods, for a biodegradable, silver nanoparticle (SNPs) con-taining antimicrobial scaffolds composed of pentaerythritol triacrylate-co-trimethylolpropane tris (3 -mercaptopropionate) (PETA) and hydroxyapatite (HA). This osteoinductive and degradable material is designed to stimulate proliferation of bone progenitor cells, and provide controlled release of antimicrobial components. The first method, denoted as the “incorporating method, ” involves dissolving SNPs in ethanol, butanol, or isopropanol and directly incorporating the particles into the scaffold prior to polymerization.

25|$|Large {{intestinal}} ileus is {{most commonly}} seen in horses following <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgery,</b> but its risk is also increased {{in cases where}} post-operative pain is not well-controlled, after long surgeries, and possibly following ophthalmologic surgeries. It is characterized by decreased manure output (<3 piles per day), rather than nasogastric reflux, as well as decreased gut sounds, signs of colic, and the occasional impaction of the cecum or large colon. Cecal impactions can be fatal, so {{care must be taken}} to monitor the horse for large intestinal ileus after <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgery,</b> primarily by watching for decreased manure production.|$|E

40|$|Background : Patients {{undergoing}} elective <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgeries</b> often incur excess {{blood loss}} necessitating transfusion. The preoperative placement of blood requests frequently overshoots the actual need resulting in unnecessary crossmatching. Aims : Our primary {{goal was to}} audit the blood utilization in elective <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgeries</b> in our hospital over a 1 -year period and recommend a blood ordering schedule. Materials and Methods : A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent elective <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgeries</b> {{over a period of}} 1 year was done. The data collected include patients&#x 2032; age, sex, type of surgical procedure, pre- and postoperative hemoglobin (Hb) levels, number of units crossmatched, returned, transfused, crossmatch to transfusion ratio (C:T), transfusion indices, estimated blood loss for each surgical procedure, and the actual and predicted fall in Hb. We propose a blood ordering schedule based on surgical blood ordering equation. Results and Conclusions : A total of 487 patients with a median age of 37 &# 177; 17 years (mean &# 177; standard deviation) were evaluated. One thousand three hundred and seventy-seven units of blood were crossmatched and only 564 units were transfused to 260 patients. Fifty-nine percent of the units crossmatched were not transfused. Six of the 12 elective procedures had a C:T ratio higher than 2. 5. Ten of the 12 procedures (83. 3 &#x 0025;) had a low transfusion index (TI < 0. 5). The calculated red blood cell units were less than 0. 5 in 5 of the 12 elective procedures, and hence we recommend a group and save policy for these procedures.
