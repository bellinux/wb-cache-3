Typically they are sold in boxes containing two to four stacks of crackers, each wrapped in a sleeve <b>of</b> <b>waxed</b> <b>paper</b> or plastic. In restaurants, they are found in small wrapped packets of two crackers, which generally accompany soup or salad. Cracker meal, a type of coarse to semi-fine flour made of crushed saltine crackers, {{may be used as}} toppings for dishes; breading for fried or baked red meats, poultry, fish or as a thickener for soups, stews, sauces, and chilis.|$|E

50|$|Characteristically, Khedoori's {{works have}} {{comprised}} intricate details, models or architectural renderings set within the broad expanses <b>of</b> <b>waxed</b> <b>paper</b> or linen. This delicate combination frequently necessitates close viewing which results, then, {{in the works}} filling the spectator's entire field of vision. In recent years, Khedoori's works have introduced inversions of the more usual black detail on white expanse, incorporated natural imagery and landscape, and also taken the form of dramatically smaller-scale works than those hitherto produced. Her most recent output has also moved from wax-on-paper into oil and canvas, with subject matter drawing influence from geometric sequences.|$|E

5000|$|In the mid-1890s Babbitt and his {{brothers}} George H. and John E. Babbitt purchased the Robertson Paper Company of Bellows Falls and the Howland Pulp & Paper Company of Howland, Maine. They operated both companies for five years, after which they sold Howland Pulp & Paper. In addition, Frederick and John bought out George at Robertson Paper, of which Frederick became President and John Treasurer. Under their leadership Robertson Paper became the largest producer <b>of</b> <b>waxed</b> <b>paper</b> in the United States.

50|$|The house, whose {{architect}} is not known, {{was built}} between 1892 and 1894 for William A. Hall, an executive and experimental chemist {{associated with the}} Fall Mountain Paper Company, one of Bellows Falls' leading companies. Hall, a Massachusetts native, {{may have played a}} role in bringing the Colonial Revival aesthetic to Bellows Falls, for this is one the earliest elaborate examples of the style in the region. In 1903 Hall sold the house to Francis G. Flint, part owner of a local paper mill. John Babbitt, the third owner of this house, owned one of the largest manufacturers in the nation <b>of</b> <b>waxed</b> <b>paper.</b> In the 1990s the building was restored and adapted for use as a bed and breakfast inn.|$|E

The biscuits were given to each person attending the funeral, and were a custom of the funerals of [...] "lower and the middling class of people".|$|R
50|$|Non-sport trading cards {{have been}} {{distributed}} many different ways. The most common way to buy cards was {{in what was}} called Wax Packs. Five to eight cards were wrapped in a type <b>of</b> <b>wax</b> <b>paper</b> that had a graphic of the set {{on the front of}} the paper. These were sold in grocery stores, in toy stores and small vending machines. These packs were sold individually or in a box of 24 packs.|$|R

After reduction, butter is stirred in to finish the sauce.|$|R
5000|$|The {{practice}} of oiling parchment or paper {{in order to}} make it semi-translucent or moisture-proof goes back at least to the middle ages. Paper impregnated or coated with purified beeswax was widely used throughout the 19th century to retain or exclude moisture, or to wrap odorous products. Gustave Le Gray introduced the use <b>of</b> <b>waxed</b> <b>paper</b> for photographic negatives in 1851. [...] Natural wax was largely replaced for the making of wax paper (or paraffine paper) after Herman Frasch developed ways of purifying paraffin and coating paper with it in 1876. Wax paper is commonly used in cooking for its non-stick properties, and wrapping food for storage, such as cookies, as it keeps water out or in. It is also used in arts and crafts.|$|E
50|$|The oldest {{portion of}} the complex, its main {{manufacturing}} area, was built about 1890 by C.W. Osgood and Son, a maker of papermaking machinery. Successors to this firm enlarged the premises, and were eventually merged into the Robertson Paper Company in 1907. Robertson was founded in 1881, and was at first engaged {{in the manufacture of}} tissue paper in a plant {{at the southern end of}} the island. It expanded into the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>waxed</b> <b>paper,</b> and was, at the time of its acquisition of this plant, one of the nation's largest manufacturers of that product. The firm remained in business at this site, under a variety of names and ownerships, until 1987, when it succumbed to bankruptcy. It was at that time the longest continuously operational paper company in the state.|$|E
50|$|The laurel oil {{is added}} {{at the end}} of the process, and after it is mixed in, the mix is taken from the vat and poured over a large sheet <b>of</b> <b>waxed</b> <b>paper</b> on the floor of the factory.At this point the soap is a large, green, flat mass, and it is allowed to cool down and harden for about a day. While the soap is cooling, workers with planks of wood {{strapped}} to their feet walk over the soap to try to smooth out the batch and make it an even thickness. The soap is then cut; three workers drag a rake-like cutting device through the soap to cut it one way, then again the other way until the whole mass is cut into individual cubes. Each cube is stamped with the soap artisan's name.|$|E
50|$|At first, {{potato chips}} were {{distributed}} in bulk from barrels or glass display cases, or tins, which left chips {{at the bottom}} stale and crumbled. Laura Scudder started having her workers take home sheets <b>of</b> <b>wax</b> <b>paper</b> to iron into the form of bags, which were filled with chips at her factory the next day.

5000|$|Necessity was {{the mother}} of {{invention}} for Bidgood, who created elaborate photographic tableaux in his small midtown Manhattan studio apartment. His first erotic series was an underwater epic called Water Colors, made in the early 1960s, in which he used a dancer from Club 82 named Jay Garvin as his subject. The underwater atmosphere is completely fabricated; {{the bottom of the ocean}} was created with silver lame spread across the floor of Bidgood's apartment; he made the arch of a cave out <b>of</b> <b>waxed</b> <b>paper,</b> and fashioned red lame into the shape of lobster. He coated Garvin with mineral oil and pasted glitter and sequins to his skin so the silver fabric under photographic lights would reflect on his body like water. For weeks at a time, Bidgood would eat and sleep within the sets he constructed in his apartment.|$|E
5000|$|Wise Foods {{started as}} Wise Potato Chip Company, founded in Berwick, Pennsylvania, in 1921 {{by a young}} man named Earl Wise, Sr.. He owned Wise Delicatessen and began making potato chips as a way to make use of excess potatoes, {{initially}} cooking them in his mother's kitchen, and then selling them to customers in brown paper bags. At the time, potato chips were generally kept in glass display cases, or cracker barrels, and scooped into paper bags for customers. The bags developed grease spots and did not keep the chips fresh for very long, eventually leading to the development <b>of</b> <b>waxed</b> <b>paper</b> bags. Wise's chips proved an immediate hit with customers and soon the delicatessen owner became a regional potato chip mogul. He decided on an owl as a company mascot, a creature reputed to be [...] "wise," [...] the stylized eye of which remains the corporate logo. He had his first delivery truck by 1922, and opened his first production plant in 1925.|$|E

It wasn't in organic chemistry which the focus of his teacher, August Wilhelm von Hofmann, {{might have been expected}} to lead him towards, but into new compounds of selenium. These were the subject of his first published papers, 1851. He worked with Manuel Johnson at the Radcliffe Observatory in Oxford in 1854, where he adapted the recent innovation <b>of</b> <b>wax</b> <b>paper</b> photography to machines built by Francis Ronalds to continuously record meteorological parameters. In 1855 he was appointed lecturer in chemistry at the Chester Diocesan Training College.|$|R
50|$|The {{term has}} been used since at least as early as 1848, when Anne Brontë {{mentioned}} it in her novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. The Kellogg brothers first used paperboard cartons to hold their flaked corn cereal, and later, when they began marketing it to the general public, a heat-sealed bag <b>of</b> <b>wax</b> <b>paper</b> was wrapped around {{the outside of the}} box and printed with their brand name. This marked the origin of the cereal box, though in modern times the sealed bag is plastic and is kept inside the box rather than outside.

Kieckhefer, which excelled in the use of fibre shipping containers, which especially included the paper milk carton.|$|R

50|$|Stevens is {{credited}} with telling the story that at the home opener of the New York Giants on a cold April day in 1901 there was limited demand for ice cream. He decided to sell German sausages known as 'dachshund sausages.' When the staff ran out <b>of</b> the <b>wax</b> <b>paper</b> on which the sausages were traditionally served Stevens had one of his employees purchase some buns and had the staff place the hot dogs in the buns, creating what became known today as the hot dog. A cartoonist, recording the event, was reputed to {{have been unable to}} spell dachshund, so wrote hot dogs instead. The family has since acquired the original cartoon and has preserved it.|$|R
5000|$|After the consolidation, the {{president}} of Nabisco, Adolphus Green, asked Frank Peters to create a package to distribute fresher products. This paved its way for In-Er Seal package, whose logo is a prototype for the [...] "Nabisco Thing", an animated character created in 1995 to sell its products to kids. The In-Er Seal package is a system <b>of</b> inter-folded <b>wax</b> <b>paper</b> and cardboard to [...] "seal in the freshness" [...] of the product.

30|$|Hydrogenated {{castor oil}} (HCO) is {{insoluble}} in water and in most organic solvents but it is soluble in hot organic solvents like ether and chloroform [29]. This insolubility is among good qualities that make HCO valuable for lubricant industries because of water resistance and retention of its lubricity. Moreover, the polarity and surface wetting properties of HCO are useful in cosmetics, hair dressing, solid lubricant, paint additives, manufacture <b>of</b> <b>waxes,</b> polishes, carbon <b>paper,</b> candles and crayons [28].|$|R
40|$|Hearing loss is {{a common}} chronic {{condition}} among older adults. The most common form is sensorineural hearing loss, which is caused by damage to the hair cells of the inner ear. Physicians have little ability to reliably access the complex anatomy of the inner ear and thus are unable to cure the most common forms of hearing loss. Two generations of an image-guided robotic system for targeted, atraumatic needle access to the cochlea of the inner ear were developed. Both systems utilize a custom scanning end-effector that sweeps a single-element ultrasound transducer through a circular arc to construct a two-dimensional scan of the chambers of the cochlea. 150 �m O. D. stainless steel micro-needles were developed that mount alongside the ultrasound transducer. Image-guided needle placement was achieved by selecting a point on an ultrasound image and carrying {{out a series of}} global moves of the linear base stages of the robotic system to place the needle tip at the selected point. The first-generation system was used to image a human cadaveric cochlea. These images are, to our knowledge, the first reported application of high-resolution ul-trasound to the imaging of the internal structures of the cochlea. In the second-generation system, a method for precise calibration of the tip of the micro-needle to ii the ultrasound image was developed. Image-guided needle placement was validated in two phantoms. A <b>wax</b> <b>paper</b> phantom was constructed in which two layers <b>of</b> <b>wax</b> <b>paper</b> were suspended above a glass slide using shim stock to create a space of approximately 300 �m between the sheets. A silicone tube phantom was constructed in which a piece of silicone micro-tubing, 300 �m in inside diameter, was filled with water and glued to a glass slide. In both experiments, image-guided needle placement was successful and was verified by endoscope imaging...|$|R
