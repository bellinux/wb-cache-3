5|$|The Poor Law system {{fell into}} decline at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century owing to factors such as the introduction of the Liberal welfare reforms and the availability of other sources of assistance from friendly societies and trade unions, as well as piecemeal reforms which bypassed the Poor Law system.

5|$|After sacking Scottish coach Graeme Souness, Benfica {{appointed}} UEFA Champions League-winning manager Jupp Heynckes. Limited by ongoing financial difficulties, {{the club}} signings consisted of players either <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>books,</b> free transfers or loans, such {{as with the}} Spaniards Chano and Tote, the former on a free deal, and the latter on loan. Tote arrived to replace Rushfeldt, who signed and practised with the team, before being recalled back by Rosenborg with disagreements over his transfer. Benfica started their campaign with a six-game winning streak in their first seven league games, topping the league until December; when a record-setting loss to Celta de Vigo, the greatest in its history, negatively affected the team mentality, causing them to drop to third place in Matchday 19, which would become their final position, finishing eight points behind Sporting, but securing {{a position in the}} upcoming season's UEFA Cup.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} this period, the {{constant}} attempts at reorganisation had proved a mixed bag, particularly for the auxiliary forces. The Militia was heavily understrength and disorganised, whilst the number of recruits for the Volunteers was falling off and the financial situation of the units was becoming worrying. The system of central per-capita grants helped support the units, despite the worrying side-effect of causing an incentive to keep as many men <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> as possible regardless of fitness, but even so it was becoming apparent that many Volunteer Corps were headed towards financial collapse unless some action were taken.|$|E
5|$|Claudius {{also wrote}} commentaries <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> of Leviticus, the {{historical}} {{books of the}} Old Testament, the Gospel of Matthew, and all Pauline epistles, of which the commentary on the Epistle to Galatians shows some of his views prefigure those expressed by both the Waldensians and Protestants centuries later. It was once {{thought that he had}} in fact founded the Waldensians, however this was disproved in the 19th century. His epistles on 1 and 2 Corinthians, however, dedicated to Theodemir, abbot of Psalmody, and a possible student of his, were sent to Aachen by the dedicatee to be condemned by the assembled bishops of the realm. The Corinthian commentaries were unpublished, though it was these commentaries that sparked the controversy concerning icons and pilgrimages.|$|E

5|$|Following Stop and Smell the Roses, Starr's {{recording}} {{projects were}} beset with problems. After completing Old Wave in 1982 with producer Joe Walsh, {{he was unable}} to find a record company willing to release the album in the UK or the US. In 1987, he abandoned sessions in Memphis for a planned country album, produced by Chips Moman, after which Moman was blocked by a court injunction from issuing the recordings. Starr nevertheless maintained a high public profile through his narration over 1984–86 of the popular children's series Thomas & Friends, a Britt Allcroft production based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> by the Reverend W. Awdry. For a single season in 1989, Starr also portrayed the character Mr. Conductor in the programme's American spin-off, Shining Time Station.|$|E
5|$|Gowing {{attempted}} to negotiate better {{conditions at the}} University of Kent that would allow more time to work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>books,</b> but this was denied. She applied for a vacant chair in the History and Philosophy of Science at University College London in 1970, without success. Then, in February 1972, Sir Rudolf Peierls and Nicholas Kurti informed her that the University of Oxford had created a new chair {{in the history of}} science, {{the first of its kind}} in the university's long history. She did not expect to get the chair, but Peierls, Sir Frederick Dainton and Hugh Trevor-Roper were on the selection panel, and in the end offered the chair in the history of science to Gowing, a woman who did not have a degree in history or science.|$|E
5|$|Some of the translators {{hired to}} work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> were {{well-known}} authors before {{their work on}} Harry Potter, such as Viktor Golyshev, who oversaw the Russian translation of the series' fifth book. The Turkish translation of books two to seven was undertaken by Sevin Okyay, a popular literary critic and cultural commentator. For reasons of secrecy, translation on a given book could only start after it had been released in English, leading to a lag of several months before the translations were available. This led {{to more and more}} copies of the English editions being sold to impatient fans in non-English speaking countries; for example, such was the clamour to read the fifth book that its English language edition became the first English-language book ever to top the best-seller list in France.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Chester, {{he spent}} time in non-League {{football}} with Runcorn F.C. Halton and Witton Albion. While <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> at Witton, he spent five weeks on trial with Football League One side Crewe Alexandra but was not offered a contract, so he signed for League Two side Accrington Stanley in 2006. Whalley spent almost two years with the Lancashire club, but following his release {{in the summer of}} 2008, he returned to non-League, initially with Wrexham. While at Wrexham, he had a short loan spell with Southport where he helped the team to the Conference North play-offs. He subsequently played at Droylsden, where {{he was part of the}} team that won the Manchester Premier Cup in 2010, and Hyde before joining Southport again on a permanent basis in January 2011. He was signed by Luton Town in the summer of 2013 for an undisclosed fee, and joined AFC Telford United on loan in 2014. Both Luton and Telford won their respective leagues during the 2013–14 season, making Whalley a winner of both the Conference Premier and the Conference North in the same season. He left Luton in May 2015, later joining Shrewsbury.|$|E
5|$|Born in Isleworth, Greater London, Mousinho {{was signed}} by then Brentford manager Martin Allen during the 2005–06 season, after {{returning}} from the United States where he was studying and playing at the University of Notre Dame.

He made his league debut for the club two months later in a 4–1 away win over Tranmere Rovers, coming on as a 76th-minute substitute. Initially he acted as cover for regular right-back Kevin O'Connor, but was then played in a central midfield role. He was also the outfield player chosen to play as goalkeeper against Gillingham in 2006, when Clark Masters was sent-off, {{and there was not}} a substitute goalkeeper available; the game ended 2–2 with Mousinho playing 75 minutes in goal.|$|E
5|$|Like {{his older}} brother Ben, Jarvis started his career <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> of Millwall, but was {{released}} by the club. With {{the help of a}} member of the Millwall coaching staff, however, he was taken on by Kent-based club Gillingham as a trainee. On 4 November 2003, at the age of 17, he made his Football League debut in a match against Sunderland when a number of senior players were missing due to influenza. He came on as a 76th-minute substitute for Richard Rose in a match which his team lost 3–1. He next played for the first team in an FA Cup defeat to Burnley on 24 January 2004, and went on to feature regularly in the team in March and April. In total he made two starts and eight substitute appearances during the 2003–04 season, but also continued to play for the youth team, helping them reach the last sixteen of the FA Youth Cup.
