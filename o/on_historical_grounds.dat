Belgium also lost Eastern Limburg, Zeeuws Vlaanderen and French Flanders and Eupen: four territories which it had claimed <b>on</b> <b>historical</b> <b>grounds.</b> The Netherlands retained the former two while French Flanders, which had been annexed {{at the time of}} Louis XIV remained in French possession, and Eupen remained within the German Confederation, although it would pass to Belgium after World War I in reparations.|$|E

The first study on the reasons Germans from Transylvania entered the SS appeared only in 2007, twelve years after the novel was published; in general, discussions on The Reader have solidly placed Hanna in the context of Germany.

Only a few, short writings of Bekkos’s have received modern, critical editions. One of them is his work De pace ecclesiastica ("On Ecclesiastical Peace"), found in V. Laurent and J. Darrouzès, Dossier Grec de l’Union de Lyon, 1273–1277 (Paris, 1976); in it, Bekkos criticizes the foundations of the schism between the Churches <b>on</b> <b>historical</b> <b>grounds</b> alone, pointing out that the Patriarch Photios only chose to launch a campaign against the Latin doctrine after his claim to be rightful Patriarch of Constantinople was rejected by Pope Nicholas I.|$|E

Both methods relied on calibrated data from a high resolution sensor that passed over the target site at the White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, on November 21, 1988. The first approach required ground reflectance and atmospheric optical depth data taken during overpass time. The second method relied <b>on</b> <b>historical</b> <b>ground</b> reflectance data and utilized standard atmospheric models. The calibration gains varied widely depending on which set of calibration offsets were used, but the agreement between the gains computed by the two methods was very close: approximately 1 % in channel 1 and 2 % in channel 2.

40|$|Ship {{traffic is}} one of the factors that is {{presented}} in almost all of the existing grounding models, and is considered as one of the affecting factors on the likelihood of grounding accident. This effect in grounding accident is mostly accepted by the experts as a common sense or simply by just generalizing the ship-ship collision cases to grounding accidents. There is no available research on the actual causal link between the ship traffic and grounding accident in the literature. In this paper, authors have utilized the statistical analysis <b>on</b> <b>historical</b> <b>grounding</b> accident data in the Gulf of Finland between the years 1989 and 2010 and the AIS data of the same area in year 2010, as the source of ship traffic data, to investigate the possible existence of any correlation between the ship traffic and the grounding accident. The results show that for the studied area (Gulf of Finland) there is no correlation between the traffic density and the grounding accident. However, the possibility of the existence of minor relation between the traffic distribution and grounding accident is shown by the result. This finding, however, needs further investigation for more clarification...|$|R

50|$|Bakker Schut {{was aware}} that it was {{difficult}} to claim this area <b>on</b> <b>historical</b> <b>grounds,</b> due to the long-time German rule of the territory, and the historically German speaking population.

Contrary to what might be expected, after an inventory he considered the natural resources of the territory to be annexed as insufficiently important to motivate annexation.
