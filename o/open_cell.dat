25|$|Porous {{absorbers}} {{are most}} commonly made from fiberglass, mineral wool or <b>open</b> <b>cell</b> foam that resists {{the passage of}} air molecules through the interstitial space. Porous absorbers often incorporate a foil or paper facing to reflect frequencies above 500Hz. Facing also improves low bass absorption by translating the physical compression of air at the facing into physical compression of the fibers that are {{in contact with the}} facing while also maintaining the resistive loss of air as it is driven through the bulk of the fiber by the facing.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} <b>open</b> <b>cell</b> {{geometry}} is a cylinder, which is axially segmented to produce electrodes {{in the shape}} of a ring. The central ring electrode is commonly used for applying radial excitation electric field and detection. DC electric voltage is applied on the terminal ring electrodes to trap ions along the magnetic field lines. Open cylindrical cells with ring electrodes of different diameters have also been designed. They proved not only capable in trapping and detecting both ion polarities simultaneously, but also they succeeded to separate positive from negative ions radially. This presented a large discrimination in kinetic ion acceleration between positive and negative ions trapped simultaneously inside the new cell. Several ion axial acceleration schemes were recently written for ion–ion collision studies.|$|E
