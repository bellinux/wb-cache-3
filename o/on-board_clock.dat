40|$|In Global Navigation Satellite Systems, the {{on-board}} {{time has}} to be modelized and predicted in order to broadcast the time parameters to final users. As a consequence, the time prediction performance of the <b>on-board</b> <b>clocks</b> {{has to be}} characterized. In order to estimate the time uncertainty of the on-board oscillator, a linear or parabolic fit is performed over the sequence of observed time difference and extrapolated during the prediction period. In 1998, CNES proposed specifications of orbit determination and time synchronization for GNSS- 2. The needs of synchronization were specified as the maximum error of the time difference prediction from the extrapolated fit.

Some of the more recent GLONASS clock performance is at about the same level as that of the GPS clocks.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{limiting}} the phase error of the remote time keeping system, RTKS, clock for the Japanese quasi-zenith satellite system (QZSS), is presented. To provide a proper positioning signal, QZSS satellites need stable on-board time references. Instead of using atomic references, the recently proposed RTKS employs a remote synchronization scheme that provides an opportune synchronization/correction signal {{able to keep}} a master time reference, located on the ground, and the QZSS satellite on-board time reference constantly in lock step. One of the critic issues regarding this architecture {{is the loss of}} synchronization due to satellite communication interruption. The proposed method consists of a learning algorithm that monitors the <b>on-board</b> <b>clock</b> behavior during its regular functioning. Consequently, when synchronization becomes unavailable the QZSS onboard clock phase/frequency drift is kept contained by using a consecutive estimation of the clock phase error.

40|$|Prospective {{memories}} can divert attentional {{resources from}} ongoing activities. However, {{it is unclear}} whether these effects and the theoretical accounts that seek to explain them will generalise to a complex real-world task such as driving. Twenty-four participants drove two simulated routes while maintaining a fixed headway with a lead vehicle. Drivers were given either event-based (e. g. arriving at a filling station) or time-based errands (e. g. <b>on-board</b> <b>clock</b> shows 3 : 30). In contrast to the predominant view in the literature which suggests time-based tasks are more demanding, drivers given event-based errands showed greater difficulty in mirroring lead vehicle speed changes compared to the time-based group. Results suggest that common everyday secondary tasks, such as scouting the roadside for a bank, may have a detrimental impact on driving performance. The additional finding that this cost was only evident with the event-based task highlights a potential area of both theoretical and practical interest. Practitioner Summary: Drivers were given either time- or event-based errands whilst engaged in a simulated drive. We examined the effect of errands on an ongoing vehicle follow task. In contrast to previous non-driving studies, event-based errands are more disruptive. Common everyday errands may have a detrimental impact on driving performance...|$|E
50|$|The Global Positioning System (GPS) {{operated}} by the US Air Force Space Command provides very accurate timing and frequency signals. A GPS receiver works by measuring the relative time delay of signals from a minimum of four, but usually more, GPS satellites, {{each of which has}} at least two onboard caesium and as many as two rubidium atomic clocks. The relative times are mathematically transformed into three absolute spatial coordinates and one absolute time coordinate.GPS Time (GPST) is a continuous time scale and theoretically accurate to about 14 ns. However, most receivers lose accuracy in the interpretation of the signals and are only accurate to 100 ns.The GPST is related to but differs from TAI (International Atomic Time) and UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). GPST remains at a constant offset with TAI (TAI - GPST = 19 seconds) and like TAI does not implement leap seconds. Periodic corrections are performed to the <b>on-board</b> <b>clocks</b> in the satellites to keep them synchronized with ground clocks. The GPS navigation message includes the difference between GPST and UTC. As of July 2015, GPST is 17 seconds ahead of UTC because of the leap second added to UTC on 30 June 2015.

40|$|Abstract—Exploiting the {{increasing}} ubiquitous deployment of sensor networks, the paper presents a system called WiBee that utilizes ZigBee sensors to build real-time WiFi radio maps. The design of WiBee {{is motivated by}} the observation that a ZigBee radio can sense WiFi frame transmissions although it cannot decode WiFi frames. A sensor passively listens on the wireless channel and estimates the RSS of a WiFi AP at its location. The design of WiBee faces three unique challenges. First, multiple APs may transmit frames concurrently and frame collisions may happen. Second, because of severe resource constraints, a sensor cannot sample the channel at arbitrarily high frequency and hence some frame transmissions may not be sampled. Third, sensor nodes are usually not time synchronized and the <b>on-board</b> <b>clock</b> is inaccurate. To address these challenges, we propose a novel gateway-assisted approach to estimating WiFi RSS values at ZigBee sensors. A light-weight algorithm is designed for identifying the RSS values corresponding to a given AP. It searches the sequence of ZigBee RSS samples for an AP signature sequence. An optimization technique is proposed to address issues of clock drift and time asynchronization. Our extensive experiments on a testbed show that WiBee can achieve low estimation error, short delay and small computation overhead...|$|E

40|$|The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) is {{responsible}} for designing and implementing a clock maintenance system for the Ballistic Missile Defense Organizations (BMDO) Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) spacecraft. The MSX spacecraft has an <b>on-board</b> <b>clock</b> {{that will be used}} to control execution of time-dependent commands and to time tag all science and housekeeping data received from the spacecraft. MSX mission objectives have dictated that this spacecraft time, UTC(MSX), maintain a required accuracy with respect to UTC(USNO) of +/- 10 ms with a +/- 1 ms desired accuracy. APL's atomic time standards and the downlinked spacecraft time were used to develop a time maintenance system that will estimate the current MSX clock time offset during an APL pass and make estimates of the clock's drift and aging using the offset estimates from many passes. Using this information, the clock's accuracy will be maintained by uplinking periodic clock correction commands. The resulting time maintenance system is a combination of offset measurement, command/telemetry, and mission planning hardware and computing assets. All assets provide necessary inputs for deciding when corrections to the MSX spacecraft clock must be made to maintain its required accuracy without inhibiting other mission objectives.

A well-known data analysis technique, the so-called time-delay interferometry (TDI), provides synthesized data streams free of laser phase noise. At the same time, TDI also removes the next largest noise source: phase fluctuations of the <b>on-board</b> <b>clocks</b> which distort the sampling process. TDI needs precise information about the spacecraft separations, sampling times and differential clock noise between the three spacecrafts.

In this paper, we will present the mathematical formulation of the LISA-like data streams and discuss a compliant algorithm that corrects for both clock and laser noise in the case of a rotating, non-breathing LISA constellation. In contrast to previous papers, we consider the current optical bench design (split interferometry configuration), i. e. the test mass readout is done by the local oscillators only, instead of reflecting the weak inter-spacecraft light off the test mass. Furthermore, the absolute order of laser frequencies is taken into account and it can be shown that the TDI equations remain invariant.

This paper summarizes relativistic {{effects in the}} context of XNAV. It also characterizes the primary task in the time domain of realizing an <b>on-board</b> master <b>clock</b> that time-tags detected X-ray photons with sufficient ac-curacy to permit meaningful navigation solutions. XNAV must first estimate the periods of uncatalogued X-ray pulsars to determine suitable candidate pulsars for navi-gation. This task will use an efficient search algorithm to determine the pulsar period from a sensor aimed at the pulsar. As a part of this search and catalogue task, an accumu-lator that integrates photon counts will compute average counts per sampling time interval, in time bins that are small compared to the pulsar’s period. This operation is dubbed the pulsar profiler function. It is intended to build a reference or standard profile of a chosen pulsar for later use. The search and catalogue need to be suf-ficient for navigation based on times-of-arrival of pulsar signals in real time vs. the <b>on-board</b> reference <b>clock.</b> Op-erationally, the timing module locates in time the high-est peak (or other defined phase center) in the group velocity of received, periodic plane-wave pulses from cat-alogued pulsars.
