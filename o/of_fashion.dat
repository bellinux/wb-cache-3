40|$|In {{spite of}} our {{increasing}} {{knowledge about the}} existing patterns in accounting research, we still have much {{to learn about the}} cross-national dynamics of research ideas. This paper addresses the ebb and flow <b>of</b> research <b>fashions</b> in management accounting among national groups of accounting scholars. We also attempt to enhance existing knowledge about the underlying reasons that differentiate between earlier and later adopters <b>of</b> research <b>fashions.</b> Drawing on the literature of institutional sociology and management <b>fashion,</b> definitions <b>of</b> the accounting organizational field and <b>of</b> <b>fashions</b> <b>of</b> research are first provided. We then take Activity-Based Costing (ABC) to illustrate our understanding <b>of</b> research <b>fashions</b> in management accounting. Our results provide support for the propositions that national communities with high research profiles are less vulnerable to the effects <b>of</b> research <b>fashions,</b> and that they are earlier adopters <b>of</b> research <b>fashions</b> than their counterparts with lower research profiles. Lastly, we make some suggestions for further investigation regarding the cross-national mobility of research ideas relating to management accounting. ...|$|R

5|$|When {{a pattern}} is called digital, this most often {{means that it}} is visibly {{composed}} of computer-generated pixels. The term is sometimes also used of computer generated patterns like the non-pixellated Multicam and the Italian fractal Vegetato pattern. Neither pixellation nor digitization contribute to the camouflaging effect. The pixellated style, however, simplifies design and eases printing on fabric, compared to traditional patterns. While digital patterns are becoming widespread, critics maintain that the pixellated look is a question <b>of</b> <b>fashion</b> rather than function.|$|E

5|$|Anggun's {{image has}} been {{compared}} to that of Pocahontas. At the early stage of her career as a rock singer, Anggun was known for her tomboy look—wearing a crooked beret, shorts, studded jacket, and large belt; this set a trend during the early 1990s. Later, she has focused on femininity and sexuality, emphasising her long black hair and brown skin. For this look she utilises the work <b>of</b> <b>fashion</b> designers like Azzedine Alaïa, Dolce & Gabbana, and Roberto Cavalli. In 2001, Anggun was dubbed as the sixth Sexiest Women of Asia by FHM magazine. Later in 2010, she was ranked at number 18 on the French version of FHMs list of 100 Sexiest Women in the World.|$|E
