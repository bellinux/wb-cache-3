2500|$|The {{first group}} of Directives create a range of {{individual}} rights in EU employment relationships. The Employment Information Directive 1991 requires that every employee (however defined by member state law) {{has the right to}} a written statement of their employment contract. While there is no wage regulation, the Institutions for <b>Occupational</b> <b>Retirement</b> <b>Provision</b> Directive 2003 requires that pension benefits are protected through a national insurance fund, that information is provided to beneficiaries, and minimum standards of governance are observed. Most member states go far beyond these requirements, particularly by requiring a vote for employees in who manages their money. Reflecting basic standards in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and ILO Conventions, the Working Time Directive 2003 requires a minimum of 4 weeks (totalling 28 days) paid holidays each year, a minimum of 20-minute paid rest breaks for 6-hour work shifts, limits on night work or time spent on dangerous work, and a maximum 48-hour working week unless a worker individually consents. The Parental Leave Directive 2010 creates a bare minimum of 4 months of unpaid leave for parents (mothers, fathers, or legal guardians) to care for children before they turn 8 years old, and the Pregnant Workers Directive 1992 creates a right for mothers to a minimum of 14 weeks' paid leave to care for children. Finally, the Safety and Health at Work Directive 1989 requires basic requirements to prevent and insure against workplace risks, with employee consultation and participation, and this is complemented by specialised Directives, ranging from work equipment to dangerous industries. In almost all cases, all member states go significantly beyond this minimum. The objective of transnational regulation is therefore to progressively raise the minimum floor in line with economic development. Second, equality was affirmed by the Court of Justice in Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG to be a general principle of EU law. Further to this, the Part-time Work Directive 1997, Fixed-term Work Directive 1999 and Temporary Agency Work Directive 2008 generally require that people who do not have ordinary full-time, permanent contracts are treated no less favourably than their colleagues. However, the scope of the protected worker is left to member state law, and the TAWD 2008 only applies to [...] "basic working conditions" [...] (mostly pay, working hours and participation rights) and enabled member states to have a qualifying period. The Race Equality Directive 2000, Equality Framework Directive 2000 and Equal Treatment Directive 2006 prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, disability, religion or belief, age, race and gender. As well as [...] "direct discrimination", there is a prohibition on [...] "indirect discrimination" [...] where employers apply a neutral rule to everybody, but this has a disproportionate impact on the protected group. The rules are not consolidated, and on gender pay potentially limited in not enabling a hypothetical comparator, or comparators in outsourced business. Equality rules do not yet apply to child care rights, which only give women substantial time off, and consequently hinder equality in men and women caring for children after birth, and pursuing their careers.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} governance standards are rights vote for {{who is on the}} board of directors for investors of labour and capital. A Draft Fifth Company Law Directive proposed in 1972, which would have required EU-wide rights for employees to vote for boards stalled mainly because it attempted to require two-tier board structures, although most EU member states have codetermination today with unified boards. The Shareholder Rights Directive 2007 requires shareholders be able to make proposals, ask questions at meetings, vote by proxy and vote through intermediaries. This has become increasingly important as most company shares are held by institutional investors (primarily asset managers or banks, depending on the member state) who are holding [...] "other people's money". A large proportion of this money comes from employees and other people saving for retirement, but who do not have an effective voice. Unlike Switzerland after a 2013 people's initiative, or the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act 2010 in relation to brokers, the EU has not yet prevented intermediaries casting votes without express instructions of beneficiaries. This concentrates power into a small number of financial institutions, and creates the potential for conflicts of interest where financial institutions sell retirement, banking or products to companies in which they cast votes with other people's money. A series of rights for ultimate investors exist in the Institutions for <b>Occupational</b> <b>Retirement</b> <b>Provision</b> Directive 2003. This requires duties of disclosure in how a retirement fund is run, funding and insurance to guard against insolvency, but not yet that voting rights are only cast on the instructions of investors. By contrast, the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive 2009 does suggest that investors in a mutual fund or ("collective investment scheme") should control the voting rights. The UCITS Directive 2009 is primarily concerned with creating a [...] "passport". If a firm complies with rules on authorisation, and governance of the management and investment companies in an overall fund structure, it can sell its shares in a collective investment scheme across the EU. This forms a broader package of Directives on securities and financial market regulation, much of which has been shaped by experience in the banking crisis of 2007–08. Additional rules on remuneration practices, separating depositary bodies in firms from management and investment companies, and more penalties for violations were inserted in 2014. These measures are meant to decrease the risk to investors that an investment goes insolvent. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004 applies to other businesses selling financial instruments. It requires similar authorisation procedures to have a [...] "passport" [...] to sell in any EU country, and transparency of financial contracts through duties to disclose material information about products being sold, including disclosure of potential conflicts of interest with clients. The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive 2011 applies to firms with massive quantities of capital, over €100million, essentially hedge funds and private equity firms. Similarly, it requires authorisation to sell products EU wide, and then basic transparency requirements on products being sold, requirements in remuneration policies for fund managers that are perceived to reduce [...] "risk" [...] or make pay [...] "performance" [...] related. They do not, however, require limits to pay. There are general prohibitions on conflicts of interest, and specialised prohibitions on asset stripping. The Solvency II Directive 2009 is directed particularly at insurance firms, requiring minimum capital and best practices in valuation of assets, again to avoid insolvency. The Capital Requirements Directives contain analogous rules, with a similar goals, for banks. To administer the new rules, the European System of Financial Supervision was established in 2011, and consists of three main branches: the European Securities and Markets Authority in Paris, the European Banking Authority in London and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority in Frankfurt.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I will {{introduce}} several new mechanisms of risk sharing regarding <b>occupational</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>provisions,</b> {{based on the}} analysis of present risk sharing between sponsoring employers and plan participants, individual participants and participants as a group, active members and beneficiaries (including deferred members), etc. Among others, I {{will introduce}} "Ring-fenced" DB (RfDB) plans, which introduce "share" structure into contributions and reserves, prohibit "lending" from active members to beneficiaries when the plan is in an underfunded status (actuarial deficiency), and allow temporary benefit reductions within prescribed ranges according to the funding level. The risk active members bear will be eased in RfDB plans, and market interest risk sponsoring employers bear will also be eased, because some portion of benefits becomes conditional. RfDB plans allow investments with greater risk tolerance, which may benefit both labor and management from a long-term perspective. It will also be possible to ease funding rules substantially for RfDB plans. It is said that DB plans {{are on the verge}} of extinction mainly by the threats from accounting standards.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the {{emergence}} of organizational isomorphism in the industry superannuation sector in Australia. The largest not-for-profit private businesses in the country, the industry funds were created in the 1980 s in light of a broader union campaign to extend <b>occupational</b> <b>retirement</b> savings <b>provision</b> to all employees in Australia. Design/methodology/approach – The emergence of organizational isomorphism among the industry funds is assessed from the perspective of institutional theory. The study is based on interviews with key players in the establishment of the industry superannuation sector, original archival research as well as contemporary public commentaries and more recent historical assessments. Findings – The tripartite framework of institutional isomorphism established by DiMaggio and Powell is unable to explain the emergence of the widespread organizational isomorphism found in industry superannuation. Using the more recent notion of institutional logics allows a more satisfactory explanation for the convergence in models of retirement-savings provision in the industry superannuation sector. Originality/value – Organizational isomorphism cannot be described simply in terms of a tripartite framework of professional normativity, state coercion and market-based mimesis. Alternatively governed organizations such as those created by trade unions may develop in a different manner than social enterprises founded by less powerful social actors...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reflects}} on the ongoing challenges presented by certain employers who, whilst deducting <b>occupational</b> <b>retirement</b> fund contributions from their employees' salaries, fail to pay over those contributions to the relevant <b>occupational</b> <b>retirement</b> funds. These employers also often fail to register themselves or their employees as participating members of <b>occupational</b> <b>retirement</b> funds when they are supposed to. Such failures to register with the relevant <b>occupational</b> <b>retirement</b> funds and to pay over fund contributions have disastrous effects on the employees {{who are at the}} receiving end of these unlawful practices. This is the case because employees lose the value and use of their salaries through the deductions, and also the benefits of their <b>occupational</b> <b>retirement</b> funds. Although the Pension Funds Act 24 of 1956 is sufficiently responsive and provides adequate mechanisms to guide against this scourge, it is this paper's argument that <b>occupational</b> <b>retirement</b> funds themselves have not done their bit in enforcing the Pension Funds Act. The failure {{on the part of the}} funds to enforce the Pension Funds Act by ensuring that fund contributions are collected from participating employers has resulted in, and continues to result in, untold losses on the part of the employees. Properly considered, the paper submits that the failure by <b>occupational</b> <b>retirement</b> funds to enforce the Pension Funds Act has the potential of unjustifiably limiting several of the employee members' constitutional rights. It is not good enough, so argues the paper, for <b>occupational</b> <b>retirement</b> funds to have rules that prohibit them from paying retirement fund benefits where no contributions have been received. It is also not good enough for courts and the office of the PFA to blindly enforce the rules of <b>occupational</b> <b>retirement</b> funds without consistently subjecting them to the Pension Funds Act and the Constitution for validity and legality. It is on this basis that the case of Orion Money Purchase Pension Fund (SA) v Pension Funds Adjudicator is challenged. The case is authority for the principle that the only available remedy to an employee who has been cheated out of retirement fund benefits owing to the employer's failure to make fund contributions is one that compels the fund to calculate those outstanding contributions and demand that total sum from the employer. For various reasons this does not address the problem of defaulting employers, which can be addressed only by properly enforcing the Pension Funds Act and also consistently subjecting the rules to the Act in cases of disputes. ...|$|R

The aim of this paper is to provide a political-economic explanation of the wide spread adoption of early retirement.

Whereas the elimination of financial and tax barriers has proceeded smoothly, harmonization of the social and labour components within the occupational pension domain did not occur, slowing down the development of pan-European pension plans.

The main findings of the study are that the proposed solvency capital requirement framework could lead to IORPs shifting their investment allocations towards a greater proportion of 2 ̆ 01 clow-risk 2 ̆ 01 d asset classes. However, the impact is likely to vary extensively across EU countries, in line with national pension legislation, demographic profiles, the macro-financial situation and cultural preferences. Nevertheless, the study finds some empirical support to suggest that even the announcement of the proposed revisions, which have in the meantime been deferred, may already have led to some de-risking of some IORPs. Furthermore, some pro-cyclicality of IORPs 2 ̆ 019 investment strategies could be expected should these proposals be adopted, although the exact outcomes will depend on their precise calibration, especially regarding counter-cyclical adjustments...|$|E
40|$|Pension finance {{literacy}} enables {{individuals to}} plan for retirement, make proper choices on pension products and contribute effectively in management of their pension schemes. This study sought to determine the pension finance literacy levels and the variables that influence it amongst members of <b>occupational</b> <b>retirement</b> schemes in Kenya. The sample consisted of 2395 (response rate 65 %) individuals drawn from 648 <b>occupational</b> <b>retirement</b> schemes. A binary measure of pension finance literacy was constructed and one way ANOVA and post hoc tests using the Tukey approach were conducted to determine the bases on which pension finance literacy levels differ. The study concludes that pension finance literacy differs significantly {{on the basis of}} age, education level, gender, job experience, management level, income, pension plan design, participation in previous pension finance literacy program, area of specialization and membership in a pension plan board but does not differ {{on the basis of the}} marital status of the individuals. </p...|$|R

40|$|We analyze two social {{security}} reforms aimed at increasing working lifetimes. The first reform eliminates early <b>retirement</b> <b>provisions,</b> {{while the second}} increases both the age of early eligibility and the normal retirement age. We and that although both reforms increase the participation rates of older workers, the elimination of early <b>retirement</b> <b>provisions</b> reduces future {{social security}} imbalances if benefits taken early are not reduced actuarially. Additionally, we nd that both reforms increase aggregate hours and output, although e ciency gains derived from {{the elimination of the}} early retirement scheme are distant from previous estimates since labor supply could be less responsive. Finally, we also nd that the output gap brought about by the early retirement scheme may decrease in coming decades...|$|R
