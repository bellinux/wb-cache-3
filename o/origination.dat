5|$|One of Kraft's most {{important}} contributions to manned spaceflight {{would be his}} <b>origination</b> {{of the concept of}} a Mission Control Center. Many of the engineers in Project Mercury had previously worked on the flight test of aircraft, where the role for ground support was minimal. However, Kraft soon realized that an astronaut could only do so much, particularly during the fast-moving launch phase; the Mercury spacecraft would require real time monitoring and support from specialist engineers.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} effect of local market bank {{concentration}} on business loan <b>originations</b> and on the pass-through of the federal funds rate to business loan <b>originations.</b> Economic theory {{on the relationship between}} concentration and the pass-through of input prices to quantity (or price) is ambiguous. We find that more concentrated markets have lower business loan <b>originations</b> and experience smaller changes in business loan <b>originations</b> in response to changes in the federal funds rate.

5|$|Recent work in {{developmental}} biology has identified dynamical and physical mechanisms of tissue morphogenesis that may underlie abrupt morphological transitions during evolution. Consequently, consideration of mechanisms of phylogenetic change {{that have been}} found in reality to be non-gradual is increasingly common in the field of evolutionary developmental biology, particularly in studies of the origin of morphological novelty. A description of such mechanisms {{can be found in the}} multi-authored volume <b>Origination</b> of Organismal Form (MIT Press; 2003).|$|E
5|$|Grid parity, {{the point}} at which the cost of {{photovoltaic}} electricity is equal to or cheaper than the price of grid power, is more easily achieved in areas with abundant sun and high costs for electricity such as in California and Japan. In 2008, The levelized cost of electricity for solar PV was $0.25/kWh or less in most of the OECD countries. By late 2011, the fully loaded cost was predicted to fall below $0.15/kWh for most of the OECD and to reach $0.10/kWh in sunnier regions. These cost levels are driving three emerging trends: vertical integration of the supply chain, <b>origination</b> of power purchase agreements (PPAs) by solar power companies, and unexpected risk for traditional power generation companies, grid operators and wind turbine manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|The {{rocks in}} Glacier National Park {{are the best}} {{preserved}} Proterozoic sedimentary rocks in the world, {{with some of the}} world's most fruitful sources for records of early life. Sedimentary rocks of similar age located in other regions have been greatly altered by mountain building and other metamorphic changes; consequently fossils are less common and more difficult to observe. The rocks in the park preserve such features as millimeter-scale lamination, ripple marks, mud cracks, salt-crystal casts, raindrop impressions, oolites, and other sedimentary bedding characteristics. Six fossilized species of Stromatolites, early organisms consisting of primarily blue-green algae, have been documented and dated at about 1billion years. The discovery of the Appekunny Formation, a well preserved rock stratum in the park, pushed back the established date for the <b>origination</b> of animal life a full billion years. This rock formation has bedding structures which are believed to be the remains of the earliest identified metazoan (animal) life on Earth.|$|E

40|$|Low-cost {{deposits}} and increased balance sheet liquidity raise banks' supply of illiquid loans more than loans easily sold or securitized. We exploit {{the inability of}} Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase jumbo mortgages to identify an exogenous change in liquidity. The volume of jumbo mortgage <b>originations</b> relative to nonjumbo <b>originations</b> increases with bank holdings of liquid assets and decreases with bank deposit costs. This result suggests that the increasing depth of the mortgage secondary market fostered by securitization has reduced the effect of lender's financial condition on credit supply.

25|$|There {{is still}} {{debate about the}} causes of all mass extinctions. In general, large extinctions may result when a {{biosphere}} under long-term stress undergoes a short-term shock. An underlying mechanism appears to be present in the correlation of extinction and <b>origination</b> rates to diversity. High diversity leads to a persistent increase in extinction rate; low diversity to a persistent increase in <b>origination</b> rate. These presumably ecologically controlled relationships likely amplify smaller perturbations (asteroid impacts, etc.) to produce the global effects observed.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{evidence that}} for most types of subprime mortgages, broker-originated loans {{have a higher probability}} of foreclosure than bank-originated loans, but only for loans with prepayment penalties. Possible explanations include less careful underwriting on the part of brokers relative to banks when originating loans with multiple risk factors including prepayment penalties, and a greater propensity on the part of brokers to originate loans with prepayment penalties in locales with less financially sophisticated borrowers. State anti-predatory lending law provisions restricting the use of prepayment penalties eliminate the elevated foreclosure risk of broker <b>originations</b> relative to bank <b>originations...</b>|$|R

40|$|A recent, widely cited {{study of}} North Carolina's anti-predatory lending law {{conducted}} by three analysts at the University of North Carolina purports {{to show that}} the law has been effective in curbing undesirable lending abuses while having essentially no negative side-effects on the volume of legitimate subprime lending to borrowers unable to qualify for prime credit. These findings are {{in stark contrast to the}} findings of earlier studies. This essay suggests one reason for the discrepancy: The UNC study relies on a database that does not contain the information properly required to address these issues, namely data on mortgage <b>originations.</b> The database instead contains information on the volumes of loans that have been securitized, which for reasons argued here, are not likely to represent accurately the trends in mortgage <b>originations.</b> For this and other reasons discussed below, until a thorough analysis of mortgage <b>originations</b> demonstrates otherwise, policy makers throughout the country should remain concerned about the unwanted side-effects of laudably intended state legislation aimed at stamping out predatory lending. ...|$|R
