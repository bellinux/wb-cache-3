The SSF has many other bases included Guangzhou, Haikou, Shantou, Mawei, and Beihai, while naval air force bases are at Lingshui, Haikou, Sanya, Zhanjiang, and Guiping. <b>The</b> <b>fleet's</b> area <b>of</b> operations {{is divided into}} six zones.|$|R

5|$|According to the Athenian playwright Aeschylus, who {{actually}} fought at Salamis, the Greek fleet numbered 310 triremes (the difference being {{the number of}} Athenian ships). Ctesias claims that the Athenian fleet numbered only 110 triremes, which ties in with Aeschylus's numbers. According to Hyperides, the Greek fleet numbered only 220. The fleet was effectively {{under the command of}} Themistocles, but nominally led by the Spartan nobleman Eurybiades, as had been agreed at the congress in 481 BC. Although Themistocles had tried to claim leadership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fleet,</b> the other city states with navies objected, and so Sparta (which had no naval tradition) was given command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> as a compromise.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as the}} {{above-mentioned}} decorations, Allingham won several awards and honorary memberships. Examples include the Pride of Britain award, and a position as an honorary member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fleet</b> Air Arm Association.|$|E
5|$|By 13 January {{most of the}} {{survivors}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> had limped back to France {{in a state of}} disrepair. One ship of the line that remained at sea, the 74-gun Droits de l'Homme, was commanded by Commodore Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse and carried over 1,300men, 700–800 of them soldiers, including General Jean Humbert. Detached from the main body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> during the retreat from Bantry Bay, Lacrosse {{made his way to the}} mouth of the Shannon alone. Recognising that the weather was still too violent for a landing to be made, Lacrosse acknowledged the failure of the operation and ordered the ship to return to France, capturing the British privateer Cumberland en route.|$|E

5|$|In 1888, Baden {{returned}} {{to active duty}} {{to take part in}} a naval tour of the Baltic by the newly crowned Kaiser Wilhelm II. Rear Admiral Eduard Knorr, the commander <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fleet,</b> raised his flag aboard Baden during the voyage. The fleet stopped in St. Petersburg, Stockholm, and Copenhagen on the seventeen-day cruise. Baden ran aground in the harbors of both Stockholm and Copenhagen, but was not seriously damaged in either incident. Baden also participated in the visit to Great Britain in August 1889, where Wilhelm II took part in the Cowes Regatta. Baden and the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> joined the Royal Navy in a fleet review for Queen Victoria.|$|E
5|$|In August 1914, {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of World War I, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet; Iron Duke remained the flagship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fleet,</b> now under Admiral John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe. On the evening of 22 November 1914, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea; Iron Duke stood with the main body in support of Vice Admiral David Beatty's 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November. Iron Duke and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> initially remained in port during the German raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby on 16 December 1914, though the 3rd Battle Squadron was sent to reinforce the British forces in the area. After receiving further information {{about the possibility of}} the rest of the German fleet being at sea, Jellicoe gave the order for the fleet to sortie to try to intercept the Germans, though by that time they had already retreated. Iron Duke went to sea with the 2nd and 4th Battle Squadrons for gunnery practice north of the Hebrides on 23 and 24 December. The following day, the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> joined Iron Duke for a sweep in the North Sea, which concluded on 27 December.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1940, the {{principal}} {{concern of the}} Royal Air Force, together with elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fleet</b> Air Arm, was to contest the control of British airspace with the German Luftwaffe. For the Germans, achieving at least local air superiority was an essential prerequisite to any invasion.|$|E

5|$|On 24 May, Baden again steamed to Helgoland, {{this time}} to take the {{commander}} in chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fleet,</b> Admiral Reinhard Scheer, and Grand Duke Friedrich von Baden to visit the island. Only Karlsruhe joined the ship on this voyage.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 22 November 1914, the Grand Fleet {{conducted}} a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea to support Vice Admiral David Beatty's 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November. Marlborough and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> initially remained in port during the German raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby on 16 December 1914, though the 3rd Battle Squadron was sent to reinforce the British forces in the area. After receiving further information {{about the possibility of}} the rest of the German fleet being at sea, Jellicoe gave the order for the fleet to sortie to try to intercept the Germans, though by that time they had already retreated. Vice Admiral Cecil Burney replaced Bayley aboard Marlborough in December; at that time, Marlborough became the second-in-command flagship for the Grand Fleet. On 25 December, the fleet sortied for a sweep in the North Sea, which concluded on 27 December without event. Marlborough and the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> conducted gunnery drills during 10–13 January 1915 west of the Orkneys and Shetlands. On {{the evening of}} 23 January, the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty's Battlecruiser Fleet but the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> did not become engaged in the ensuing Battle of Dogger Bank the following day.|$|E

5|$|The five Kaiser Friedrich III-class battleships were {{assigned}} to the I Squadron of the Home Fleet (Heimatflotte) after commissioning. Here they conducted extensive annual training maneuvers with the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fleet.</b> After ten years of fleet service, they were replaced with newer ships. They were transferred to the III Squadron <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fleet,</b> which had by then been reorganized as the High Seas Fleet, and placed in reserve. The ships were recalled to active service at the outbreak of World War I, but saw limited duty during the war. They initially served in V Squadron, until 1915, when the ships were relegated to auxiliary roles, primarily as prison ships. After the war, all five of the ships were sold and scrapped by 1922.|$|E
5|$|Wörth and {{the rest}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> {{operated}} under the normal routine of individual and unit training {{in the first half}} of 1897. The ship represented Germany during the Fleet Review for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in June 1897. The typical routine was interrupted in early August when Wilhelm II and Augusta went to visit the Russian imperial court at Kronstadt; both divisions of the I Squadron were sent to accompany the Kaiser. They returned to Neufahrwasser in Danzig on 15 August, where the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> joined them for the annual autumn maneuvers. The maneuvers were completed by 22 September in Wilhelmshaven. In early December, the I Division conducted maneuvers in the Kattegat and the Skagerrak, though they were cut short due to shortages in officers and men.|$|E

The commander <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fleet,</b> Walerand of Wavrin, sent envoys to Hungary to start negotiations about a joint campaign against the Ottoman Empire. At Hunyadi's request, one of Wavrin's envoys, Pedro Vasque de Saavedra, visited Vlad and convinced him to meet Wavrin. In July, Vlad went to Isaccea where he made an alliance with Wavrin. Vlad mustered an army of 4,000–6,000 strong and placed it {{under the command of}} his son, Mircea.|$|E

It had originally been planned in 1943, and was revived as a major transport plan in 1965. London Transport spent £10m (now £m) in 1972 safeguarding the route underneath Cannon Street and building reinforcements for laying a tube in the water-bearing ground around the station. The plan was abandoned in the early 1980s in favour of the current extension further south.|$|E
