It focuses on 162 evaluations of operations in two countries - Ghana and Vietnam - and two sectors - transport and storage - between 1999 and 2010. In particular, it looks at whether trade was a true <b>objective</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operations under <b>scrutiny,</b> and whether trade and development outcomes were evaluated. More broadly, it asks whether the evaluations selected offer the information that policy makers in charge of international aid want – and need - to get from field evaluators...|$|R
40|$|This study {{engages with}} ubuntu {{as a moral}} notion, and exclusionary social {{boundaries}} in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> refugee ministry at the Central Methodist Mission (CMM) in inner-city Johannesburg. Ubuntu, a Nguni term that can be translated as humanity or humaneness, is often claimed to be <b>the</b> moral backbone <b>of</b> (South) African communities. According to the academic ubuntu discourse that scrutinises this notion, interdependence characterises human existence, as human beings only become, and exist, through other human beings, in a community. Virtues commonly attached to ubuntu include respect, hospitality and compassion. While the ubuntu discourse comprises the theoretical framework and dialogue partner in the study, international migration, socio-economic inequality and xenophobia are among the forces that defined <b>the</b> social location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CMM. A praxis cycle framework informed <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> this research, as it offered a way to combine ethnographic fieldwork with notions emphasized in grounded theory and an interest in patterns of socio-moral thinking invoked by the writer s training in systematic theology. Drawing, for instance, on emphases vocalized by liberation theologians, the praxis cycle also underlines <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> questions about societal context and the researcher s agency. In 2009 when the fieldwork for the study was conducted, the CMM building, a six-storey church in inner-city Johannesburg, both served a large local congregation (members) and offered shelter to 2, 000 - 3, 000 international migrants and homeless South Africans (dwellers). <b>The</b> <b>objective</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tense relationship between these two groups is to understand grassroots meanings attached to being human(e) and factors that limited or enabled <b>the</b> actualization <b>of</b> ubuntu in this context. The study approaches these meanings and dynamics from two perspectives. Firstly, the liberation-theologically framed vision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CMM, Bishop Verryn, is analysed and defined as a contextual Christian ubuntu vision. As the challenges in the vision s material application in the Refugee Ministry are examined, {{it is noted that}} <b>the</b> contestation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> interdependence in community in <b>the</b> day-to-day managing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ministry seemed to reinforce the often exclusionary member/dweller boundary; while, on the other hand, <b>the</b> preaching <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vision and the leader s lifestyle contributed to <b>the</b> bridging <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boundary. Secondly, the study explores <b>the</b> negotiation <b>of</b> exclusionary identities and boundaries within and between the members and the dwellers through examining <b>the</b> collective narratives <b>of</b> xenophobia and dirt circulating at the CMM. Attention is also paid to <b>the</b> forging <b>of</b> affirming relationships between the groups. On <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> these dynamics <b>the</b> writer presents socio-moral patterns attached to ubuntu and being human(e) in the given context: they involve relational virtues that people were expected to embody; <b>the</b> rules <b>of</b> reciprocity and survival that regulated <b>the</b> actualization <b>of</b> these virtues; limiting structural elements external and internal to the CMM; and <b>the</b> enabling element <b>of</b> encounter. Tutkimus tarkastelee ihmisyyden merkityksiä ja rajoja maahanmuuton kontekstissa Johannesburgissa Etelä-Afrikassa. Ihmisyyttä kuvataan Etelä-Afrikassa usein nguni-kielissä esiintyvällä käsitteellä ubuntu, joka voidaan nähdä yhteisöllisen ihmiskäsityksen ja siihen liittyvän, vieraanvaraisuutta, myötätuntoa ja vastaavia hyveitä korostavan moraalisen ajattelun ytimessä. Käsite esiintyy nykyään niin politiikan, uskonnon kuin liike-elämänkin alueella. Tästä vahvasta ihmisyysdiskurssista huolimatta maa ei kuitenkaan ole poikkeus maailmassa, jossa kasvava muuttoliike on vahvistanut muukalaisvihamielisiä asenteita. Moni afrikkalainen maahanmuuttaja kohtaa Johannesburgin lähiöissä eriasteista muukalaisvihaa syrjinnästä väkivaltaan. Tutkimus tarkastelee ubuntua tällaisten raja-aitojen värittämässä kontekstissa. Mitä ubuntu tarkoittaa, kun kansalainen kohtaa muukalaisen tai kun hyvin toimeentuleva kohtaa köyhän? Tutkimus perustuu vuoden kenttätyöhön johannesburgilaisella Central Methodist Mission kirkolla (CMM), joka vuonna 2009 majoitti 2000 - 3000 koditonta. Heistä suurin osa oli zimbabwelaisia pakolaisia ja turvapaikanhakijoita. Kuusikerroksinen CMM-rakennus toimi myös paikallisen seurakunnan kokoontumispaikkana. Vapautuksen teologiasta vaikutteita saaneen piispan johtama pakolaisprojekti ei kuitenkaan saanut seurakunnan varauksetonta tukea. Seurakunnan ja kirkolla asuvien ihmisten välinen suhde oli päinvastoin kireä. Seurakunnan ja pakolaisten välinen suhde tarjoaa kontekstin ruohonjuuritason ubuntun tarkastelulle. Ubuntuun liittyvät arvot olivat sekä piispan saarnojen ytimessä että keskeinen elementti odotuksissa, joita ihmisillä oli suhteessa toisiin ihmisiin. Kuitenkin CMM:n sisäiset, muun muassa hallintoon liittyvät tekijät sekä yleisemmin Johannesburgin keskustaa muokkaavat rakenteelliset tekijät luokkaeroista kaupungistumiseen vaikeuttivat ubuntun toteutumista seurakuntalaisten ja pakolaisten välisessä suhteessa. Ihmiset myös vetäytyivät tästä suhteesta periaatteellisista syistä: vastavuoroisuuden puute tai oman identiteetin joutuminen uhatuksi johtivat monien kohdalla ubuntun ohittamiseen. Toisaalta piispan siltojen rakentamiseen tähtäävät saarnat sekä henkilökohtaiset kohtaamiset seurakuntalaisten ja pakolaisten välillä loivat tilaa ubuntulle ja toisen kohtaamiselle ihmisenä...|$|R

40|$|In Guru Nanak v.
