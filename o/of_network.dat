5|$|Network {{synthesis}} filters. The mathematical bases <b>of</b> <b>network</b> synthesis {{were laid}} in the 1930s and 1940s. After the end of World War II network synthesis became the primary tool of filter design. Network synthesis put filter design on a firm mathematical foundation, freeing it from the mathematically sloppy techniques of image design and severing the connection with physical lines. The essence <b>of</b> <b>network</b> synthesis is that it produces a design that will (at least if implemented with ideal components) accurately reproduce the response originally specified in black box terms.|$|E
5|$|The essence <b>of</b> <b>network</b> {{synthesis}} is {{to start}} with a required filter response and produce a network that delivers that response, or approximates to it within a specified boundary. This is the inverse <b>of</b> <b>network</b> analysis which starts with a given network and by applying the various electric circuit theorems predicts the response of the network. The term was first used with this meaning in the doctoral thesis of Yuk-Wing Lee (1930) and apparently arose out of a conversation with Vannevar Bush. The advantage <b>of</b> <b>network</b> synthesis over previous methods is that it provides a solution which precisely meets the design specification. This is not the case with image filters, a degree of experience is required in their design since the image filter only meets the design specification in the unrealistic case of being terminated in its own image impedance, to produce which would require the exact circuit being sought. Network synthesis on the other hand, takes care of the termination impedances simply by incorporating them into the network being designed.|$|E
5|$|A {{telecommunications}} network {{is a collection}} of transmitters, receivers, and communications channels that send messages to one another. Some digital communications networks contain one or more routers that work together to transmit information to the correct user. An analog communications network consists of one or more switches that establish a connection between two or more users. For both types <b>of</b> <b>network,</b> repeaters may be necessary to amplify or recreate the signal when it is being transmitted over long distances. This is to combat attenuation that can render the signal indistinguishable from the noise.|$|E

40|$|Existing {{studies suggest}} that, because {{knowledge}} {{is becoming more}} widely distributed, innovation increasingly needs to occur 'at the interstices' of collaborating groups and organizations. Networked innovation processes are therefore emphasized, over more hierarchical or market-based forms, as having distinct advantages for the creation and integration of knowledge. Whilst the structural properties <b>of</b> <b>networks</b> have been heavily scrutinized, there is relatively less understanding of processes, in particular the political dynamics that shape networked innovation. This article aims to develop understanding <b>of</b> <b>networked</b> innovation processes, by identifying and relating the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>networked</b> innovation to the productive, or constraining, effects of different dimensions of power (power of resource, meaning and process). It does this through comparative analysis of three case studies <b>of</b> <b>networked</b> innovation, each involving {{the development of new}} technology. This analysis suggests that understanding the politics <b>of</b> <b>networked</b> innovation depends on understanding the generative (and sometimes degenerative) relationship between power, knowledge integration, network formation, and the role of technology. Moreover, the co-ordination <b>of</b> <b>networks,</b> rather than simply their formation, is found to play a particularly crucial role...|$|R
