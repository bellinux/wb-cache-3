50|$|As {{well as a}} lubricant, {{vacuum grease}} is also used as a sealant for joints in vacuum systems.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{abnormal}} L-arginine NO signaling {{contributes to}} endothelial dysfunction in the aging cardiovascular system, the biochemical mechanisms remain controversial. L-arginine, the NO synthase (NOS) precursor, {{is also a}} substrate for arginase. We tested the hypotheses that arginase reciprocally regulates NOS by modulating L-arginine bioavailability and that arginase is upregulated in aging vasculature, contributing to depressed endothelial function. METHODS AND RESULTS: Inhibition of arginase with (S) -(2 -boronoethyl) -L-cysteine, HCl (BEC) produced vasodilation in aortic rings from young (Y) adult rats (maximum effect, 46. 4 +/- 9. 4 % at 10 (- 5) mol/L, P< 0. 01). Similar vasorelaxation was elicited with the additional arginase inhibitors N-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine (nor-NOHA) and difluoromethylornithine (DFMO). This effect required intact endothelium and was prevented by 1 H-oxadiazole quinoxalin- 1 -one (P< 0. 05 and P< 0. 001, respectively), a soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor. DFMO-elicited vasodilation was greater in old (O) compared with Y rat aortic rings (60 +/- 6 % versus 39 +/- 6 %, P< 0. 05). In addition, BEC restored depressed L-arginine (10 (- 4) mol/L) -dependent vasorelaxant responses in <b>O</b> <b>rings</b> to those of Y. Arginase activity and expression were increased in <b>O</b> <b>rings,</b> whereas NOS activity and cyclic GMP levels were decreased. BEC and DFMO suppressed arginase activity and restored NOS activity and cyclic GMP levels in O vessels to those of Y. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that arginase modulates NOS activity, likely by regulating intracellular L-arginine availability. Arginase upregulation contributes to endothelial dysfunction of aging and may therefore be a therapeutic target...|$|E

40|$|Although quartz (α-form) is {{a mineral}} used in {{numerous}} applications wherein radiation exposure is an issue, {{the nature of}} the atomistic defects formed during radiation-induced damage have not been fully clarified. Especially, the extent of oxygen vacancy formation is still debated, which is an issue of primary importance as optical techniques based on charged oxygen vacancies have been utilized to assess the level of radiation damage in quartz.
