You can adopt all the {{policies}} you please, but how they will be carried on depends on him. Even if you make leagues and treaties, he will have to manage them. He will assume control of your cities and nations. He is going to move on and take over your prisons, churches, schools, universities and corporations.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together {{to the point where you}} can forget about how you do things and concentrate <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E

500|$|Robinson's Hollywood exploits, however, did not {{sit well}} with Dodgers {{co-owner}} Walter O'Malley, who referred to Robinson as [...] "Rickey's prima donna". In late 1950, Rickey's contract as the Dodgers' team President expired. Weary of constant disagreements with O'Malley, and with no hope of being re-appointed as President of the Dodgers, Rickey cashed out his one-quarter financial interest in the team, leaving O'Malley in full control of the franchise. Rickey shortly thereafter became general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Robinson was disappointed at the turn of events and wrote a sympathetic letter to Rickey, whom he considered a father figure, stating, [...] "Regardless of what happens to me in the future, it all can be placed <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have done and, believe me, I appreciate it." ...|$|E

2500|$|After being [...] "utterly inspired" [...] by Jonathon Porritt's book Seeing Green, Lucas {{joined the}} Green Party in 1986. She {{recalled}} in 2007: [...] "I thought, right! I'm going there now" [...] to the Green's main office on Clapham High Street, near where she lived. [...] "I'm {{just going to}} dedicate {{the rest of my}} life to this party". Soon afterwards she became the party's National Press Officer (1987–89) and Co-Chair (1989–90). Lucas has a reputation as a party moderniser, in terms of internal slang, a [...] "spiky" [...] rather than a [...] "fluffy". In a 2009 Guardian interview, she told Decca Aitkenhead: [...] "when I was putting people up to go on TV programmes I'd be saying to them, 'What are you planning to wear?', and they'd be slightly offended that I'd even think of asking the question. But I do genuinely think that has changed, a lot. It's a recognition, not that there's some kind of terrible compromise about putting on a tie, but that actually you don't want people to be focusing <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> look like but on what you're saying".|$|E

2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode {{positive}} review, {{giving it a}} B-. While she liked the episode, she left some reservations: [...] "Ultimately, depending <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want from your Once, “Dreamcatcher” {{was a bit of}} a let down. It moved the plot along, but at a feverish pace and with built in leaps in faith and storyline that just haven’t been explained enough. (How, for instance, did Emma learn that she could capture memories in dreamcatchers? [...] And why is that the craft she chose now that she doesn’t need to sleep?) Maybe all those assumptions and conclusions will be eventually explained in one of those “ohhhhh, I get it now” summations a couple of episodes down the road, but maybe not. Once’s writers and creators have a tendency to play fast and loose with their storylines, knowing their audience will just kind of accept it and move on. Thus, these kinds of leaps aren’t really out of the question for them. (You can’t blame them, really. We’re already watching a show about fairy tales, for crying out loud.) But I didn’t really get “Dreamcatcher.” I’m not sure that I’m supposed to yet, and down the road I might change my mind and say, “you know, that was the episode I need to go back and watch now that I know what I know.” But for now, it just left me a little cold.

2500|$|IGN {{gave the}} game 9.0 out of 10 and an Editor's Choice Award, praising the game's [...] "pure {{over-the-top}} driving entertainment. The cars and environments are gorgeous, the crashes are spectacular, {{and the new}} Autolog feature breathes {{new life into the}} time-honored tradition of video game competition among friends." [...] Eurogamer gave the game 9 out of 10. Reviewer Tom Bramwell said [...] "It's stuffed with content but rarely for the sake of it, and knowing Criterion it will be handsomely supported for months to come, even though it's already the best pure arcade racing game since Burnout Paradise." [...] GameTrailers also scored the game 9 out of 10. The reviewer stated Hot Pursuit was [...] "excellently crafted, letting you take the world's fastest cars across miles of stunning landscapes. Chases are exhilarating from either perspective, and the autolog feature completely changes how you compete with friends, keeping you hooked until you've wrecked all of their scores." [...] Destructoid gave the game 9.5 out of 10. Reviewer Nick Chester noted that [...] "it delivers a near-perfect competitive experience, in a way that few games - racing or otherwise - can. Hot Pursuit is not only a defining moment for the series, but for arcade-style racing, period." [...] Reviewer Randy Nelson of Joystiq was the second reviewer to give the game a perfect score of 10/10. Reviewer Chris Antista of GamesRadar also gave the game 10 out of 10. Chris stated that [...] "with so many modes and diverse rewards to uncover in Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit, it almost feels like 2.5 games in one package." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewer Brett Bates gave the game 9.0 out of 10, which felt much the same as GamesRadar's Chris Antista, stating [...] "In effect, you're getting two games in one: What you do as a racer has no bearing <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do as a cop." ...|$|E
2500|$|By now {{public opinion}} of the Act {{appeared}} to be waning, with a Gallup poll {{response to the question}} [...] "Based <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have read or heard, do you think the Patriot Act goes too far, is about right, or does not go far enough in restricting people's civil liberties in order to fight terrorism?" [...] showing that between 2003 and 2004 nearly a quarter of all Americans felt that the Act went too far, while most felt that it was either just right or did not go far enough. In response, the Department of Justice established a website, www.lifeandliberty.gov, that defended the Act from such organizations as the ACLU (which itself had created a website that campaigned against the Patriot Act called Safe and Free). At the same time, Attorney General Ashcroft toured 16 cities giving speeches to invite only crowds defending the Patriot Act and touting its importance. In the speeches [...] which among other things made allusions to Bunker Hill, Antietam, the Argonne, Iwo Jima, Normandy and Abraham Lincoln [...] he defended the Patriot Act's provisions that eliminated the [...] "wall" [...] preventing foreign intelligence agencies from sharing information with domestic law enforcement agencies, roving wiretaps and the expanded capabilities of the U.S. Joint Terrorism Task Force. He also claimed that they had [...] "neutralized alleged terrorist cells in Buffalo, Detroit, Seattle and Portland [...] brought 255 criminal charges. One hundred thirty two individuals have been convicted or pled guilty. All told, more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries. Many more have met a different fate." [...] Among those arrested was Sami Amin Al-Arian and seven others who were indicted on 50 counts, including using an Islamic think tank to funnel funds to the group Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which is classed as a terrorist organization by the United States government. Ashcroft cited the arrests to show how the Patriot Act had broken down information sharing barriers between agencies. The speeches themselves were met with support, but in many states Ashcroft attracted protests and a number of critical editorials were written [...] in one particularly stinging column, The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote that there was [...] "an air of desperation about it." ...|$|E
