5|$|But the dealing by {{the general}} {{government}} with the Indian tribes through treaties was resorted to as a convenient mode of regulating Indian affairs, and not because, as with other nations, {{it was the only}} mode, independently of the arbitrament of war, <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> with them.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2003, The Rolling Stones {{performed}} in Singapore {{as part of}} their 2002/2003 Licks World Tour. At the first performance, there were two inflatable dolls on stage. Both of the dolls had flags placed in their crotch area; one had the Rolling Stones logo and the other had a Singapore flag. Because of the illegal use of the state flag, and for fear <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> with the government, the dolls and the flags were removed from the second concert by the organizer.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{understanding}} of the motivators <b>of</b> consumer <b>deal</b> redemption behaviour is expected to enable marketers to use deals more effectively. In this study, consumers' exploratory tendencies (CET) have been assessed as potential motivators of proneness to eight types <b>of</b> <b>deals,</b> during the purchase of shampoo and refrigerator—two product categories. Consumers showed varying proneness to different types <b>of</b> <b>deals</b> {{depending on the type}} of exploratory tendency that they needed to satisfy and the type of good that was on sale. These findings can enable marketers to choose the most appropriate type <b>of</b> <b>deal</b> to achieve their sales target...|$|R

5|$|As part of {{consolidating}} Stalin's {{control over}} the Eastern Bloc, the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), led by Lavrentiy Beriya, supervised the establishment of Soviet-style secret police systems in the Bloc {{that were supposed to}} crush anti-communist resistance. When the slightest stirrings of independence emerged in the Bloc, Stalin's strategy matched that <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> with domestic pre-war rivals: they were removed from power, put on trial, imprisoned, and in several instances, executed.|$|E

40|$|Daily deals {{have emerged}} {{in the last three}} years as a {{successful}} form of online advertising. The downside of this success is that users are increasingly overloaded by the many thousands <b>of</b> <b>deals</b> offered each day by dozens <b>of</b> <b>deal</b> providers and aggregators. The challenge is thus offering the right deals to the right users i. e., the relevance ranking <b>of</b> <b>deals.</b> This is the problem we address in our paper. Exploiting the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>deals</b> data, we propose a combination of a term- and a concept-based retrieval model that closes the semantic gap between queries and documents expanding both of them with category information. The method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods based on term-matching alone and existing approaches for ad classification and ranking...|$|R
30|$|Fifth, {{it would}} be useful to {{investigate}} the role <b>of</b> <b>deal</b> importance in greater depth, including any impact <b>of</b> <b>deal</b> size. We did not find substantive differences based on size. Nonetheless, because we selected deals that were important to the chaebol, differences might arise for deals with lower profiles.|$|R

After years <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> with chronic pain, Barbette committed suicide on August 5, 1973. Both in life and following his death, Barbette served as an inspiration to a number of artists, including Jean Cocteau and Man Ray.|$|E
5|$|For {{various reasons}} it was {{impossible}} to apply some of the terms of the Act. Less eligibility was in some cases impossible without starving paupers and the high cost of building workhouses incurred by rate payers meant that outdoor relief continued to be a popular alternative. Despite efforts to ban outdoor relief, parishes continued to offer it as a more cost-effective method <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> with pauperism. The Outdoor Labour Test Order and Outdoor Relief Prohibitory Order were both issued to try to prevent people receiving relief outside of the workhouse.|$|E

Leicester's will {{appointed}} her as executrix and her income from both her husbands' jointures amounted to £3,000 annually, to which came plate and movables worth £6,000. However, her jointure was to suffer greatly from paying off Leicester's debts, which at some £50,000 were so overwhelming {{that she was}} advised to decline the responsibility <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> with her husband's financial legacy.|$|E
5|$|Persistent {{attempts}} by the Israeli government to identify another Palestinian leader to represent the Palestinian people failed. Arafat was enjoying the support of groups that, given his own history, would normally have been quite wary <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> with or supporting him. Marwan Barghouti (a leader of al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades) emerged as a possible replacement during the Second Intifada, but Israel had him arrested for allegedly {{being involved in the}} killing of twenty-six civilians, and he was sentenced to five life terms.|$|E

5|$|The censor was {{appointed}} specifically {{to conduct the}} census. This involved counting the Roman people, assessing their property, and assigning them to their appropriate centuria and tribus. They were elected around every four or five years. After the passage of lex Ovinia, the censors were also transferred the power from the consuls to control membership in the Senate. Along with the main responsibility <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> with the census, the censors also dealt with property disputes, public contracts, and the management of public lands.|$|E

After Hoxie surrenders, Riddick receives the codes to Hoxie's ship and Riddick and Johns escape {{disguised as a}} guard and prisoner. Two guards enter Hoxie's room, where Hoxie is bound and covered in Riddick's former attire. They mistake him for Riddick and kill him. Riddick and Johns take off in Hoxie's ship, ending the game.|$|E

5|$|After the May elections, the Grinius/Sleževičius {{government}} lifted martial law, {{still in}} effect in Kaunas and other localities, restored democratic freedoms, and granted broad amnesty to political prisoners. For the first time, Lithuania had become truly democratic. However, the change {{did not meet}} with universal approval. Many of the released prisoners were communists who quickly used the new freedoms of speech to organize a protest attended by approximately 400 people in Kaunas on 13 June. The protest was dispersed. The new government's opposition used this protest as the platform for a public attack on the government, alleging that it was allowing illegal organizations (the Communist Party of Lithuania was still outlawed) to continue their activities freely. Despite its local nature, the incident was presented as {{a major threat to}} Lithuania and its military; the government was said to be incapable <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> with this threat.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} bats, the little brown bat is mostly active {{at night and}} leaves its roost at dusk and {{the next two or}} three hours are peak {{activity}} periods. They are also active before dawn. Since little brown bats live in a temperate zone, they must find some way <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> with winter. Most temperate bats either migrate or hibernate, but little brown bats do both. In summer, the males and females live apart, the females raise the young. When fall comes, both sexes fly south to a hibernaculum, where they mate and then hibernate. Little brown bats undergo a prolonged period of hibernation during the winter due to the lack of food. They hibernate in caves as a community.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on {{the third}} day, ukukus grouped by {{moieties}} climb the glaciers on Qullqipunku to retrieve crosses set on top. Some ukukus traditionally spent the night on the glacier to combat spirits. They also cut and bring back blocks of the ice, which {{is believed to have}} sacred medicinal qualities. The ukukus are considered to be the only ones capable <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> with condenados, the cursed souls said to inhabit the snowfields. According to oral traditions, ukukus from different moieties used to engage in ritual battles on the glaciers, but this practice was banned by the Catholic Church. After a mass celebrated later this day, most pilgrims leave the sanctuary. One group carries the Lord of Quyllurit'i in procession to Tayankani before taking it back to Mawallani.|$|E
