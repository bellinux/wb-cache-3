5000|$|Tröltsch was {{a pioneer}} of modern otology, and made {{improvements}} involving diagnostics and pathological-anatomical research {{in the study of}} the ear. He is credited for popularizing the [...] "reflecting aural mirror" [...] (a device consisting of a concave mirror with an aperture in the center) for use in <b>otoscopy.</b> In 1864, with Adam Politzer (1835-1920) and Hermann Schwartze (1837-1910), he founded the first journal dedicated to ear disorders, called Archiv für Ohrenheilkunde (Archive for Otology).|$|E
50|$|After an <b>otoscopy</b> (examination of the {{ear with}} an otoscope) {{to ensure that the}} path to the eardrum is clear and that there is no perforation, the test is {{performed}} by inserting the tympanometer probe in the ear canal. The instrument changes the pressure in the ear, generates a pure tone, and measures the eardrum responses to the sound at different pressures. This produces a series of data measuring how admittance varies with pressure, which is plotted as a tympanogram.|$|E
50|$|Network {{hospital}} {{is required to}} carry screening equipments like stethoscope, sphygmomanometer, glucometer, thermometer, ECG machine, fundoscope, pseudoscope, weigh machine, height scale, otoscope, tuning fork etc. Network {{hospital is}} also required to carry common drugs which includes ibuprofen, paracetamol, aspirin, diclofenac sodium, metronidazole, albendazole, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, ranitidine, B-complex etc. Doctors in health camp are required to carry out following investigations on the patients - hemogram, ESR, BSL, blood group, routine microscopic X-ray, fundoscopy, <b>otoscopy,</b> radiological ECG, USG, vision test, hearing test etc.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used otoscopes—those used in emergency rooms, pediatric offices, general practice, and by internists- are monocular devices. They provide only a two-dimensional view of the ear canal, its contents, and usually at least {{a portion of the}} eardrum, depending on what is within the ear canal and its status. Another method of performing <b>otoscopy</b> (visualization of the ear) is use of a binocular microscope, in conjunction with a larger metal ear speculum, with the patient supine and the head tilted, which provides a much larger field of view and the added advantages of a stable head, far superior lighting, and most importantly, depth perception. A binocular (two-eyed) view is required in order to judge depth. If wax or another material obstructs the canal and/or a view of the entire eardrum, it can easily and confidently be removed with specialized suction tips and other microscopic ear instruments, whereas the absence of depth perception with the one-eyed view of a common otoscope makes removal of anything more laborious and hazardous. Another major advantage of the binocular microscope is that both of the examiner's hands are free, since the microscope is suspended from a stand. The microscope has up to 40x power magnification, which allows much more detailed viewing of the entire ear canal, and of the entire eardrum unless edema of the canal skin prevents it. Subtle changes in the anatomy are much more easily detected and interpreted than with a monocular view otoscope. Traditionally only ENT specialists (otolaryngologists) and otologists (subspecialty ear doctors) acquire binocular microscopes and the necessary skills and training to use them, and incorporate their routine use in evaluating patient's ear complaints. Studies have shown that reliance on a monocular otoscope to diagnose ear disease results in a more than 50% chance of misdiagnosis, as compared to binocular microscopic <b>otoscopy.</b> The expense of acquiring a binocular microscope is only one obstacle to its being more widely adapted to general medicine. The low level of familiarity with binocular <b>otoscopy</b> among pediatric and general medicine professors in physician training programs is probably a more difficult obstacle to overcome. Thus, the standard of general otologic diagnosis and ear care remains, for the most part, the largely antiquated monocular otoscope.|$|E
5000|$|When {{determining}} the best protocol for school-based screenings, {{it is important}} to note the limitations of both equipment and potential screening staff. For example, the screening staff may not have the skills in <b>otoscopy,</b> or ear examination, to identify ear pathology as such, other than through gross visual examination for disorders such as pinna abnormalities, discharge, or impacted wax (McPherson & Olusanya, 2008). [...] Gell et al., (1992) advises against the use of tympanometry in screening for developing countries where the prevalence of otitis media is high since [...] "(a) ear discharge can be better noted through visual inspection of the ear, and (b) identification of moderate to severe hearing loss is a priority" [...] (McPherson & Olusanya, 2008).|$|E
5000|$|Considerations when {{determining}} {{an effective}} school-based screening protocol {{in developing countries}} includes hearing loss criteria, screening tools, and an appropriate referral pathway. In regards to the pass/fail criteria for hearing screenings, the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) guidelines use a >20 dB HL cut-off intensity (Roush, 1990) {{though there is a}} growing tendency for audiologists in developed countries to use a >15 dB HL criteria. The World Health Organization (WHO) criterion for [...] "priority for hearing aids" [...] in children is an average hearing loss in the 31 to 80 dB HL range in the better ear (WHO, 2004). However, if there is a local capacity to provide appropriate hearing health care, according to McPherson and Olusanya (2008), then this does not preclude screening that also targets milder degrees of hearing loss. Research has shown that even minimal intervention such as preferential seating in the classroom may improve educational outcomes for children with slight and mild hearing loss and unilateral hearing loss (McPherson & Holborow, 1985; Olusanya et al., 2004).The three recommended tests in school-based-screenings for developing countries are <b>otoscopy,</b> pure-tone audiometry screening, and otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). <b>Otoscopy</b> is useful in the examination of the external ear, ear canal, and tympanic membrane. Otoscopic examination is useful in ruling out impacted cerumen. According to Rao et al. (2002), Lyn et al. (1998), and Swart et al. (1995), impacted cerumen {{is one of the most}} common ear diseases and causes of hearing loss, with prevalence rate between 7.4% and 63%. Additionally, <b>otoscopy</b> does not require a great deal of expertise beyond basic training and is useful to refer a child when the tympanic membrane cannot be visualized due to occlusion of the external auditory meatus by cerumen.Pure-tone audiometry screening, in which there is typically no attempt to find threshold, has been found to accurately assess hearing status in children six years and older, when trained health workers in the community of rural Bangladeshi village used a simple condition play response procedure (Berg et al., 2006 [...] ). Recommended test frequencies are 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz, at 20 dB HL according to the ASHA (1997) guidelines for screening audiometry. However, 500 Hz has been found to identify the auditory impact of otitis media with effusion in children and should be included at 25 dB HL when permitted by ambient noise levels (WHO, 1997). [...] In regards to equipment, noise-excluding earphones are advisable in order to limit external noise factors. If possible, though costly, an effective way to reduce background noise is through the use of a mobile hearing screening facility. Examples of such a facility include the use of a 4x4 vehicles in the HARK Project of South Africa (Ogilvy & Michelson, 2003). These facilities incorporate a sound-treated environment for hearing screening. Lastly, in order to reduce operator errors, Roeser and Clark (2004) recommend a minimum training program of no less than five days while WHO recommends an initial three-week training program (WHO, 2004) for ‘primary ear health workers.’Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) can be in both newborns and child based hearing screenings. OAEs are an objective tool that can be used to measure the integrity of the outer hair cells in the cochlear; however, test results below 2000 Hz can be adversely affected by high levels of ambient noise in the school environment (Nozza, 2001 [...] ). OAEs can be used in populations where responses to pure-tone audiometry are either unable to be obtained or results are unreliable. OAEs may be particularly useful in the screening of preschool age children.|$|E
5000|$|An {{otoscope}} or auriscope is {{a medical}} device {{which is used to}} look into the ears. Health care providers use otoscopes to screen for illness during regular check-ups and also to investigate ear symptoms. An otoscope potentially gives a view of the ear canal and tympanic membrane or eardrum. Because the eardrum is the border separating the external ear canal from the middle ear, its characteristics can be indicative of various diseases of the middle ear space. The presence of cerumen (ear wax), shed skin, pus, canal skin edema, foreign body, and various ear diseases can obscure any view of the eardrum and thus severely compromise the value of <b>otoscopy</b> done with a common otoscope. [...] The most commonly used otoscopes consist of a handle and a head. The head contains a light source and a simple low-power magnifying lens, typically around 8 diopters (3.00x Mag). The distal (front) end of the otoscope has an attachment for disposable plastic ear specula. The examiner first straightens the ear canal by pulling on the pinna and then inserts the ear speculum side of the otoscope into the external ear. It is important to brace the hand holding the otoscope against the patient's head to avoid injury to the ear canal by placing the index finger or little finger against the head. The examiner can then look through a lens on the rear of the instrument and see inside the ear canal. In many models, the lens can be removed, which allows the examiner to insert instruments through the otoscope into the ear canal, such as for removing earwax (cerumen). Most models also have an insertion point for a bulb capable of pushing air through the speculum which is called pneumatic otoscope. This puff of air allows an examiner to test the mobility of the tympanic membrane.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite {{the fact}} that <b>otoscopy</b> is a widely used and taught {{diagnostic}} tool during medical training, errors in diagnosis are common. Physical <b>otoscopy</b> simulators have high fidelity, {{but they can be}} expensive and {{only a limited number of}} students can use them at a given time. OBJECTIVES: 1) To develop a purely web-based <b>otoscopy</b> simulator that can easily be distributed to students over the internet. 2) To assess face and content validity of the simulator by surveying experts in <b>otoscopy.</b> METHODS: An <b>otoscopy</b> simulator, OtoTrain™, was developed at Western University using web-based programming and Unity 3 D. Eleven experts from academic institutions in North America were recruited to test the simulator and respond to an online questionnaire. A 7 -point Likert scale was used to answer questions related to face validity (realism of the simulator), content validity (expert evaluation of subject matter and test items), and applicability to medical training. RESULTS: The mean responses for the face validity, content validity, and applicability to medical training portions of the questionnaire were all ≤ 3, falling between the 2 ̆ 2 Agree 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 Mostly Agree 2 ̆ 2, and 2 ̆ 2 Strongly Agree 2 ̆ 2 categories. The responses suggest good face and content validity of the simulator. Open-ended questions revealed that the primary drawbacks of the simulator were the lack of a haptic arm for force feedback, a need for increased focus on pneumatic <b>otoscopy,</b> and few rare disorders shown on <b>otoscopy.</b> CONCLUSION: OtoTrain™ is a novel, web-based <b>otoscopy</b> simulator that can be easily distributed and used by students on a variety of platforms.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the value of pneumatic <b>otoscopy</b> in diagnosing otitis media with effusion in primary care. Pneumatic <b>otoscopy</b> was carried out for 111 children aged one to 16 years and the results obtained compared with those obtained from tympanometry. The children were those who had attended for a regular ear, nose and throat check up in the health centre of a school for the deaf during the period November 1989 to January 1990. Pneumatic <b>otoscopy</b> and tympanometry with the GSI 28 instrument (Grason-Stadler) were carried out by a trained ear, nose and throat nurse. All relevant features determined using <b>otoscopy</b> [...] the colour, position and mobility of the tympanum [...] and an overall assessment were recorded. The results of tympanometry were evaluated independently of the otoscopic findings. In the population examined the predictive values of positive and negative results of pneumatic <b>otoscopy</b> for diagnosing effusion were high; the sensitivity was low. Serious retraction of the eardrum and absence of mobility under positive pressure were the most predictive features but the colour of the tympanum did not show any relation to effusion. In the youngest age group (one to five years) 56 % of the children had abnormal otoscopic findings in either one or both ears (odds ratio for this group versus remaining children 3. 75; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 75 to 15. 2).

40|$|ABSTRACT: A common motif in {{otolaryngology}} is {{the lack}} of certainty regarding diagnosis for middle ear conditions, resulting in many patients being overtreated under the worst-case assumption. Although pneumatic <b>otoscopy</b> and adjunctive tests offer additional information, white light <b>otoscopy</b> has been the main tool for diagnosis of external auditory canal and middle ear pathologies for over a century. In middle ear pathologies, the inability to avail high-resolution structural and/or molecular imaging is particularly glaring, leading to a complicated and erratic decision analysis. Here, we propose a novel multiwavelength fluorescence-based video-rate imaging strategy that combines readily available optical elements and software components to create a novel otoscopic device. This modified otoscope enables low-cost, detailed and objective diagnosis of common middle ear pathological conditions. Using the detection of congenital cholesteatoma as a specific example, we demonstrate the feasibility of fluorescence imaging to differentiate thi...|$|E

40|$|Detection of {{elevated}} {{body temperature}} {{is critical in}} the early diagnosis of sepsis. Due to its convenience, infrared ear temperature measurement (IETM) has become the standard of care. Unfortunately, the limitations of this method are largely unexplored.; To evaluate potential limitations of IETM, including the presence of cerumen on <b>otoscopy,</b> depth of penetration, side of measurement, {{and the impact of}} acclimatisation to room temperature.; In this prospective cohort study, 333 patients presenting to the medical emergency department underwent serial IETM before and after <b>otoscopy</b> and cleaning of the external auditory canal. The primary endpoint was defined as mean change in infrared ear temperature (IET) before and after removal of cerumen. We also tested for the effect of penetration depth, side of measurement and impact of acclimatisation.; <b>Otoscopy</b> revealed cerumen in 98 patients (29 %). Cerumen had a weak but statistically significant impact on IETM. The removal of cerumen obturans resulted in a rise in IET of 0. 20 °C (95 % CI 0. 10 - 0. 28 °C, P = 0. 03). The effects of penetration depth (P = 0. 39), side of measurement (P = 0. 78) and impact of acclimatisation (P = 0. 82) were not significant.; Cerumen has a statistically significant, albeit not clinically meaningful, influence on IETM. Thus routine ear inspection prior to the use of IETM is not warranted. IETM provides highly reproducible assessments of IET irrespective of penetration depth, side of measurement and acclimatisation...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the help effect of ceruminolytic in ceruminous external otitis in dog’s ears. Dogs with bilateral ceruminous external otitis, whose ears {{were evaluated by}} palpation, inspection, <b>otoscopy</b> and fungal and bacterial culture were studied. For the treatment, carried out twice a day during 15 days, the animals {{were divided into two}} groups, A and B. The animals in group A were treated with ceruminolytic and otological solution, containing, respectively, salicylic acid and aminoglycoside, while the animals in group B were treated only with otological solution. Clinical and microbiologic evaluations were performed on 0 and 15 days of treatment. Twenty dogs (n= 40 ears), with at least erythema in the <b>otoscopy</b> and moderate to intense ceruminous exsudate. Besides these, we observed more erythema (n= 16 in both groups) and exsudate in the acoustic conch (n= 14 and n= 11, respectively, groups A and B) and itch (n= 13 and n= 11, respectively, groups A and B). On the 15 th day, we observed reduction of all clinical signals, except stenosis, which did not change in any of the groups, and pain, which increased in group A. The microorganisms Malassezia pachydermatis e Staphylococcus sp. reduced in treatment B with statistical significance. Bacteria were more sensitive to gentamicin. The use of ceruminolytic associated to otological solution reduced the external ottis clinical signals, mainly exsudate and smell in the acoustic conch and the quantity of cerumen in the <b>otoscopy,</b> without interfering in the microorganisms reduction...|$|E

(Strength of Recommendation [SOR]: A, {{based on a}} systematic review of randomized controlled trials [RCTs].) Oral corticosteroids, with or without antibiotics, improve pneumatic <b>otoscopy</b> and tympanometry findings in the short term, but these agents have no long-term benefit.

40|$|Thirty-four {{children}} with clinically and radiologically confirmed adenoid hypertrophy underwent <b>otoscopy,</b> impedance tests, active anterior rhinomanometry and nasal mucociliary clearance evaluation before and 6 months after adenoidectomy. Mucociliary clearance velocity increased significantly while binasal resistances decreased after surgery. The authors conclude that mucociliary evaluation and objective measurements of nasal resistances {{should be added}} to impedance tests as indicators to adenoidectomy...|$|E
