5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Elsie and Frances {{admitted}} that the photographs were faked, using cardboard cutouts of fairies copied from a popular children's book of the time, but Frances maintained that the fifth and final photograph was genuine. The photographs and two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> used are {{on display in the}} National Science and Media Museum in Bradford, England.|$|E
5|$|Nick Hardwick, {{chair of}} the IPCC, said on 9 April {{that there were no}} CCTV cameras in the area. On 14 April the Evening Standard wrote that it had found at least six CCTV cameras in the area around the assault. After {{photographs}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> were published, the IPCC reversed its position and said its investigators were looking at footage from cameras in Threadneedle Street near the corner of Royal Exchange Passage.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenge}} for NASA's imaging team was that, as the mission progressed, the objects being photographed were getting {{farther away from}} the spacecraft, therefore appearing fainter and requiring longer exposures and even slewing (panning) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> to achieve good quality. The telecommunication capability also decreased with distance, limiting the number of data modes that could be used by the imaging system.|$|E

5|$|For visual localization, {{the robot}} {{estimates}} its position {{relative to the}} aircraft using visual elements (doors, windows, tires, static ports etc.) of the aircraft. During {{the evolution of the}} robot, these visual elements are extracted from a three-dimensional virtual model of the aircraft and projected in the image plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b> The projected shapes are used for pattern recognition to detect those visual elements. The other detection method used is based on the extraction of features with a Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) approach. A pairing is performed between images of each element to be detected and the actual scene experienced.|$|E
5|$|Frances died in 1986, and Elsie in 1988. Prints {{of their}} {{photographs}} of the fairies, {{along with a few}} other items including a first edition of Doyle's book The Coming of the Fairies, were sold at auction in London for £21,620 in 1998. That same year, Geoffrey Crawley sold his Cottingley Fairy material to the National Museum of Film, Photography and Television in Bradford (now the National Science and Media Museum), where it is on display. The collection included prints of the photographs, two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> used by the girls, watercolours of fairies painted by Elsie, and a nine-page letter from Elsie admitting to the hoax.|$|E

5|$|To {{create the}} bank {{needed for the}} episode, Ilt Jones and the {{location}} department staff found a former bank and current animation school and film production house on Fourth and Main Street in downtown Los Angeles. The building was completely renovated, complete with fake ATMs, columns, desks, and double-glazed windows. All of the items inside of the bank were bought from a bank-supply catalogue by set decorator Tim Stepeck. During the hold-up scene outside the bank, a four-block area was sealed off to allow cameras to film. A total of eleven cameras, some at different speeds, were used. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> made it onto the film, but they were erased during post-production.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{competitor}} on paper in 1988, Coates {{was supposed to}} only be a coach and was forbidden to compete. The Australian Skating Union had refused to select him as they wanted to allow younger athletes an opportunity to race. However, the AOF officially listed Coates as {{a competitor}} {{so that he could}} train with the others on the ice, and because the artificially inflated athlete count would entitle the Australian team to take more support staff. However, Coates was informed that the registration was only for show and that he was not to race. However, {{when it was time for}} his event, he put on a uniform, defied team orders and skated his best time ever. Henke publicly excoriated Coates in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras,</b> but stopped when he found out that Prime Minister Bob Hawke had sent Coates a congratulatory message. However, Coates' new Australian record was only good enough for 26th place and ended his sixth and final Olympic campaign. His speed skating teammates Michael Richmond and Danny Kah managed two top 15 finishes each, and Medhurst was the only other Australian to place in the top 20.|$|E
5|$|The {{second major}} {{instrument}} was the MKF-6M multispectral camera, which carried out Earth-resources observations. An improved {{form of a}} camera first tested on Soyuz 22, the camera captured an area of 165220kilometres with each image, down to a resolution of 20metres. Each image was captured simultaneously in six bands in 1200-frame cassettes, which required regular replacement due to the fogging effects of radiation. Salyut 6 also featured a KATE-140 stereoscopic topographic mapping camera with a focal length of 140millimetres, which captured images of 450450kilometres with a resolution of 50metres in the visible and infrared spectra, which could be operated either remotely or by the resident crews. The photographic capabilities of the station were, therefore, extensive, and the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture had planted a number of specifically selected crops at test sites to examine the capabilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>camera</b> weighs 5.5 oz {{and has a}} {{rechargeable}} battery life of 220 shots. When projecting continuously, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> has a battery life of approximately one hour.

5|$|When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no {{idea what}} Adam would look like in full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b> He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E

40|$|This {{demonstration}} presents CamOn, {{an autonomous}} cam-era control system for real-time 3 D games.

These measurements are fused using a Kalman filtering framework, incorporating a rather detailed model for <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> Experiments show that the resulting filter provides good estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> motion, even during fast movements...|$|R
25|$|Beginning in September 2013, the LAPD {{started a}} trial {{program for the}} use of body worn cameras with 30 {{officers}} in the Skid Row area. Reports from the trial program indicated that the cameras functioned well and that they assisted in deescalating situations although there were some technical issues with the cameras along with slight issues with the cameras falling off of officers during movement. In November 2014 in a sign of body camera purchases to come, the department chose Taser International as the vendor for body cameras to be used by the LAPD after their use in the trial program earlier in the year. On December 16, 2014 Mayor Eric Garcetti announced that the city would purchase 7,000 body worn cameras from Taser for use by the department. Patrol officers will be equipped with the cameras which will be purchased in the next fiscal year in order to outfit all patrol officers by the expected completion date in June 2016. 700 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> will first be deployed to patrol officers in the Central, Mission and Newton patrol areas of the city beginning in January 2015. $1.55 million was raised from private donors to start the body camera program for the initial rollout phase in order to ease budget constraints for the city with another $1 million coming from the National Institute of Justice, a branch of the Department of Justice. In total, the body cameras will most likely cost less than $10 million and will be included in Garcetti's proposed fiscal year 2016 budget. Before all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> are deployed to patrol officers, the Police Commission will create a policy that governs the use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> and video footage while consulting with department and city officials along with outside organizations including other departments who already use body cameras. While the commission has not created a policy yet as of December 2014, several guidelines were already outlined by the Mayor including that officers would have to turn on the cameras whenever they arrest or detain someone for interrogation, but many public interactions such as domestic violence interviews would not be recorded. The cameras may also be turned off in situations where police use deadly force. Prior to the rollout of any body worn cameras, officers were able to carry personally owned audio recording devices starting in 1994 if they file an application and obtain the requisite permission.|$|E
