50|$|<b>Oxaprotiline</b> is a racemic {{compound}} {{composed of two}} isomers, R(−)- or levo- <b>oxaprotiline</b> (levoprotiline; CGP-12,103-A), and S(+)- or dextro- <b>oxaprotiline</b> (dextroprotiline; CGP-12,104-A). Both enantiomers are active, with the levo- form acting as an antihistamine and the dextro- form having a additional pharmacology (see above), but with both unexpectedly still retaining antidepressant effects.|$|E

50|$|<b>Oxaprotiline</b> (developmental {{code name}} C 49-802 BDA), {{also known as}} hydroxymaprotiline, is a {{norepinephrine}} reuptake inhibitor of the tetracyclic antidepressant (TeCA) family that is related to maprotiline. Though investigated as an antidepressant, it was never marketed.|$|E
40|$|A column-switching {{system with}} {{high-performance}} liquid-chromatographic separation and ultraviolet detection is described for automated determination of fluvoxamine in human plasma or serum. Samples were injected {{and the drug}} was retained in a clean-up column [20 x 4. 6 mm (i. d.) ] filled with C 8 reversed-phase material (10 -sm par-ticles). After unwanted material was washed out, the drug was eluted and separated with an analytical chromatog-raphy column, 4. 6 x 250 mm (i. d.), filled with Nucleosil 100 CN (5 -p. m particles) with an acetonitrile:metha-nol: 0. 01 mol/L phosphate buffer eluent (188 : 578 : 235 by vol) at a flow rate of 1. 5 mL/min for < 20 mm and detected by spectrometry at 214 nm. With <b>oxaprotiline</b> as internal standard, fluvoxamine could be easily quantified, and it was well separated from endogenous plasma constitu...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to investigate the inhibition of synaptosomal 45 calcium uptake by <b>oxaprotiline,</b> trimipramine and doxepin stereoisomers in the rat cingulate cortex which is an associative area of the cortex that interacts with the limbic system. A concentration-dependent inhibition of net depolarization-induced 45 calcium uptake was observed for all substances tested. No significant difference in potency could be established within any of the pairs of antipodes and the IC 50 values obtained were in the 30 microM to 50 microM range. These results are quite similar to those previously obtained with this group of compounds in hippocampal synaptosomes where discrepancies between relative calcium channel antagonism and clinical activity of the antipodes have been identified. Therefore, the present study of stereoisomers of tricyclic antidepressants fails to resolve these discrepancies and does not provide unequivocal support for the hypothesis that calcium channel blockade is somehow responsible for the therapeutic effect of tricyclic antidepressants...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the chloroquine (CQ) resistance reversal properties of several different, structurally unrelated classes of compounds, including antidepressants, the way is again open to employ the aminoquino-line drugs to combat malaria effectively. In this study, CQ sensitivity was restored to varying extents in vitro in the CQ-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strain RSA 11 by using the antidepressants amitriptyline, citalo-pram, <b>oxaprotiline,</b> and nomifensine. The 50 % inhibitory concentrations (IC 50) of CQ were reduced from 360 to as low as 11 nM when antidepressants were present. These particular antidepressants are highly specific for blocking the ATP-binding cassette transport protein-mediated reuptake of different neurotransmitters at the synaptic level. This study was aimed at determining {{the extent to which the}} neurotransmitter reuptake-blocking properties of these antidepressants play a role in the reversal process. None of the compounds or CQ-antidepressant combinations tested had innate antimalarial activity. No chemosensitizer or combination showed an increased CQ accumulation or significant shift in the IC 50 in the CQ-sensitive clone D 10. Of th...|$|E
40|$|Antidepressants are {{analgesic}} in {{the absence}} or presence of depression. The underlying mechanisms probably involve a complex interplay between several neurotransmitter systems and neuroreceptors. α-Adrenoceptors {{play an important role}} in pain processing and α 2 -adrenoceptor agonists have been used in clinical pain management so we have investigated whether α-adrenoceptor sub-types mediate the antinociceptive activity of antidepressants. Thus, the abdominal constriction assay in mice was used to examine the antinociceptive responses of a diverse range of antidepressants following α 1 - or α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonism. The antidepressants or monoamine reuptake inhibitors included the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor paroxetine, the serotonin–noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor sibutramine, the resolved (+) - and (−) -enantiomers of the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor <b>oxaprotiline,</b> plus the tricyclics amitriptyline and dothiepin. All these compounds have been previously shown to be antinociceptive in this paradigm. The respective α 1 - and α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonists prazosin and RX 821002 ([2 -(2 -methoxy- 1,- 4 -benzodioxan- 2 -yl) - 2 -imidazoline]) did not produce antinociception though at 1. 0 mg kg− 1; s. c., RX 821002 but not prazosin blocked clonidine antinociception. The antinociceptive activity produced by sub-maximal doses of amitriptyline, dothiepin, sibutramine, paroxetine, (+) - and (−) -oxaprotiline were all blocked by RX 821002 but not by prazosin. Additionally, both morphine and aspirin antinociception was resistant to α 1 - and α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonism. Thus, α 2 - rather than α 1 -adrenoceptors may play an integral role in antidepressant antinociception irrespective of the propensity for inhibiting reuptake of not only noradrenaline but also serotonin. It is probable, however, that other differing pharmacological properties of some antidepressants, such as opioid-like activity, may complicate any empirical correlation between monoamine uptake and analgesia...|$|E
40|$|The release-inhibiting α 2 -adrenoceptors of {{cerebral}} serotoninergic axons {{were studied}} in mice. Slices of the hippocampus or the occipito-parietal cortex from NMRI mice, from mice lacking the α 2 A/D-, the α 2 B-, the α 2 C- or both the α 2 A/D- and the α 2 C-adrenoceptor, and from mice sharing the genetic {{background of the}} receptor-deficient animals (WT) were preincubated with [3 H]-serotonin and then superfused and stimulated electrically, in most experiments by trains of 8 pulses at 100 [*]Hz. The concentration-response curves of the α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist medetomidine were virtually identical in hippocampal slices from NMRI and WT mice, with maximally 70 % inhibition and an EC 50 of about 2 [*]nM. In hippocampal slices from NMRI mice, phentolamine and rauwolscine were equipotent antagonists against medetomidine. The effect of medetomidine was greatly reduced, with maximally 20 % inhibition, in hippocampal slices from α 2 A/D-adrenoceptor-deficient mice; was slightly reduced, with maximally 59 % inhibition, in hippocampal slices from α 2 C-adrenoceptor-deficient mice; was not changed in hippocampal slices from α 2 B-adrenoceptor-deficient mice; and was abolished in hippocampal slices from mice lacking both the α 2 A/D- and the α 2 C-adrenoceptor. Similar results were obtained in: (i) occipito-parietal slices from NMRI and α 2 A/D-adrenoceptor-deficient mice and (ii) hippocampal slices that were preincubated with [3 H]-serotonin {{in the presence of}} <b>oxaprotiline</b> to rule out cross-labelling of noradrenergic axons. The serotoninergic axons of the mouse brain possess both α 2 A/D-heteroreceptors, which predominate, and α 2 C-heteroreceptors but lack α 2 B-adrenoceptors. The situation resembles the coexistence of α 2 A/D- and α 2 C-autoreceptors but lack of α 2 B-autoreceptors at the noradrenergic axons of mice...|$|E
