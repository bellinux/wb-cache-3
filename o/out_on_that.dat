25|$|John Arnold was an attacking opening batsman for Hampshire for 20 {{years from}} 1930, when he {{qualified}} by residence, having previously played Minor Counties cricket for Oxfordshire. He scored 1,000 runs {{in his first}} full first-class season and missed <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> feat only once in his career. In 1934, he scored 2,261 runs {{at an average of}} 48 runs per innings, the only time he passed 2,000 runs in a season. His one poor season, 1938, led to him not being re-engaged by Hampshire, but the county had second thoughts and he returned for the 1939 season and for five more seasons after the Second World War. He fell ill during the 1950 season, and retired without playing again. He was a first-class umpire for 14 seasons from 1961.|$|E

However, in the gap between the Division Five and Four tournaments, he also participated in the 2014 ACC Premier League, top-scoring with 38 runs in Malaysia's loss to Hong Kong in the final match. In January 2015, Hammadullah was selected in Malaysia's squad at the 2015 ACC Twenty20 Cup, gaining selection after a late injury to Anwar Arudin.|$|E

In July 1998, Thome hit his 24th home run of that season while helping the Indians end the Yankees' 10-game winning streak. An article in Sports Illustrated published in July 1998 commented that despite Thome's early career success (two All-Star Games and appearances {{in two of the}} previous three World Series), he was only [...] "faintly famous" [...] nationally and was not particularly well-known outside of Cleveland or his hometown, Peoria. His former teammate Jeromy Burnitz said, [...] "You can't really say he's underrated, because everybody considers him one of the top hitters in the American League, but he's surrounded by so many good players, it's hard to stand <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> team." ...|$|E

Cott however both makes use of Beddard as an authority (for {{the fact that the}} Hudson's Bay Lemming turns white in winter whereas the Scandinavian Lemming does not, and for his experiments on the effectiveness of prey coloration on predators) and is critical of him for the [...] "extreme and illogical" [...] opinion held by Beddard and other authors that keeping perfectly still is vital to camouflage.

500|$|The album {{featured}} a much looser and rawer sound {{compared to the}} band's debut album, Ten. Ament said, [...] "When we made Vs., our second record, I remember thinking, 'Man, I wish our first record sounded like this.' I thought it was more direct, more powerful." [...] Besides the heavier songs, the album features two acoustic ballads in [...] "Daughter" [...] and [...] "Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town". A few of the songs incorporate elements of funk, including [...] "Animal", [...] "Blood", and [...] "Rats". McCready stated that it wasn't that the band [...] "sat down and decided to be funky," [...] but rather {{it came from the}} band [...] "exploring different directions and combining our influences." [...] Paul Evans of Rolling Stone said [...] "'Animal', 'Daughter' and 'Blood'... are songs of a kind of ritual passion, tapping into something truly wild."

500|$|The xx started {{recording}} Coexist in November 2011, {{and used}} a photography studio in North London to record the songs they had put together. They later used the rehearsal space in East London to practice playing the songs live. They recorded for six months in London and intended to finish before their scheduled music festival appearances for 2012. The xx's direction for the album was partly inspired by the electronic dance scene that occurred while they toured for their first album, {{as well as the}} live DJ sets of Smith, who was mostly listening to dark Chicago house music at the time. According to him, [...] "We left [...] when we were 17 and we missed <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> chunk of our lives when everyone else was partying." [...] However, he insisted that [...] "we're not looking to make people dance." [...] They were also influenced by pop-reggae band UB40, folk act White Hinterland, and neo soul artist Van Hunt, all of whom they listened to while recording Coexist. Croft viewed the music as a continuation of their debut, [...] "developed, but [...] like completely a world away".|$|E

500|$|When Johnston {{was up for}} {{re-election}} in 1877, {{he was involved in}} the controversial Texas-Pacific Bill, a battle between Northern and Southern railroad interests. Johnston was opposed to Tom Scott's Texas and Pacific Railway, and the bill, which favored Scott's interests. Scott was trying to persuade Southern states to accept his railroad so that they would subsequently appoint senators who would vote for the bill. Johnston's seat was vulnerable if Scott succeeded in influencing the Virginia legislature, as it was known that he opposed the bill. As Johnston wrote in a letter, [...] "...what I have done about the Pacific road is before the people and I cannot recall it if I would. It would not be policy to retreat from my position nor am I inclined to do so, if was policy. I thought & I think that I was right & am therefore ready to take the consequences. I intend to fight it <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> line." [...] William Mahone worked to prevent his re-election. Most Southern states went along with Scott, but Virginia and Louisiana did not, and Johnston was re-elected.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{addition}} of guitarist Henry McCullough, Wings' first concert tour began in 1972 with a debut performance {{in front of an}} audience of seven hundred at the University of Nottingham. Ten more gigs followed as they travelled across the UK in a van during an unannounced tour of universities, during which the band stayed in modest accommodation and received pay in coinage collected from students, while avoiding Beatles songs during their performances. McCartney later said, [...] "The main thing I didn't want was to come on stage, faced with the whole torment of five rows of press people with little pads, all looking at me and saying, 'Oh well, he is not as good as he was.' So we decided to go <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> university tour which made me less nervous... by the end of that tour I felt ready for something else, so we went into Europe." [...] During the seven-week, 25-show Wings Over Europe Tour, the band played almost solely Wings and McCartney solo material: the Little Richard cover [...] "Long Tall Sally" [...] was the only song that had previously been recorded by the Beatles. McCartney wanted the tour to avoid large venues; most of the small halls they played had capacities of fewer than 3,000 people.|$|E
500|$|The band {{performed}} in the UK in April 1982. NME considered that the show [...] "was all very skillfully deployed: a bruisingly clear sound of scathing force, a clockwork, Pavlovian lightshow, a variegation of light and shade in the song order that builds to the unmitigating force of 'Pornography' itself as the climax". However, the mood on stage was not good: The journalist noted that Smith looked [...] "dejected and tired" [...] for his birthday. Behind the scene, Smith's relationship with Gallup was deteriorating. When the tour reached Europe, tension was so high between the two musicians {{that they had a}} fight after a concert in Strasbourg. Tolhurst found out the next day that his two partners [...] "had both gone back to England". At home, Smith heard his father telling him: [...] "Get right back <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> tour! People have bought tickets!" [...] After two more weeks of touring, the band played their final show in Brussels. Tolhurst later related: [...] "I remember sitting in the dressing room thinking, 'oh well, that's the end of the band, then' [...] I went off to France for a bit. I guess I ran away. Escaping from the reality of The Cure". Back in England, Smith took a rest with a month's camping holiday to the Lake District to [...] "clean up".|$|E

[...] Asked whether Alfie appreciates Kat's honesty, he replied: [...] "Not at all – he'd rather not know.

2500|$|... "Ride" [...] is a ballad, {{composed}} in the blue-eyed soul genre. In the song, Del Rey sings over a string-drenched, piano-driven melody produced by Rick Rubin. Lyrically, {{the song was}} written by Del Rey and Justin Parker, who co-wrote almost every song on Del Rey's debut album, Born to Die. In the song, Del Rey sings lines such as, [...] "I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy" [...] and [...] "Been trying' hard not to get into trouble/But I, I've got a war in my mind... so I just ride". The song opens with an audible inhalation, before Del Rey gushes out, [...] "I've been <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> open road". The recording features mild cursing, but is otherwise laced with nostalgic lyrics and husky vocals. To further solicit the single and album, an EP was released containing remixes of [...] "Ride". Contributing artists include Sohn, MJ Cole, Eli Escobar, 14th, Wes James, and James Lavelle. Two additional remixes of the song (the Penguin Prison and the Lindstrom remixes) were released as bonus tracks with the exclusive Target release.|$|E
2500|$|Geoffrey Keating's Foras Feasa ar Éirinn (Volume III, Chapter XXXIII) recounts that Donnchad {{granted the}} crown of Ireland to the PopePope Urban II {{according}} to Keating, who places these events in 1092and asked for papal aid to return him to power. This story is repeated in many 19th century and earlier works of popular history and is given as an explanation of how the English Pope Adrian IV came to issue the papal bull Laudabiliter granting rule of Ireland to King Henry II of England. Elsewhere (Volume III, Chapter XXVII) Keating is more skeptical regarding other stories associated with Donnchad's time in Rome. He disbelieves claims that Donnchad took up with a daughter of a Holy Roman Emperor and had at least two sons from whom some later Old English families were descended. Keating writes that [...] "this story cannot be true, for before setting <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> expedition [...] was a very old decrepit man of over eighty years of age, {{and it is not}} likely that an emperor's daughter would covet intercourse with such a veteran".|$|E
