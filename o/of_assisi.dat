5|$|In both paintings, Saint Francis <b>of</b> <b>Assisi</b> kneels by a rock as he {{receives}} the stigmata {{that were to}} stay on his body until his death. The composition is tonally similar to Giotto's 1295–1300 Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata, but more grounded in earthly reality. The design is a mostly faithful representation of the original Franciscan texts, but differs in that Francis does not lean forward towards Christ.|$|E
5|$|Jesus {{appears as}} an infant in a manger (feed trough) in Christmas creches, which depict the Nativity scene. He is {{typically}} joined by Mary, Joseph, animals, shepherds, angels, and the Magi. Francis <b>of</b> <b>Assisi</b> (1181/82–1226) is credited with popularizing the creche, although he probably did not initiate it. The creche reached its height of popularity in the 17th and 18th centuries in southern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Saint Francis <b>of</b> <b>Assisi</b> is {{credited}} with creating the first live nativity scene in 1223 in order to cultivate the worship of Christ. He himself had recently been inspired by {{his visit to the}} Holy Land, where he'd been shown Jesus's traditional birthplace. The scene's popularity inspired communities throughout Catholic countries to stage similar pantomimes.|$|E

5|$|San Francisco {{was founded}} on June 29, 1776, when colonists from Spain {{established}} Presidio of San Francisco at the Golden Gate and Mission San Francisco de Asís a few miles away, all named for St. Francis <b>of</b> <b>Assisi.</b> The California Gold Rush of 1849 brought rapid growth, making it the largest city on the West Coast at the time. San Francisco became a consolidated city-county in 1856.|$|E
5|$|According to the Tales of the Minstrel of Reims, he {{was buried}} in Hagia Sophia. Perry wrote that John, who died as a Franciscan friar, may have been buried in the Franciscan church {{dedicated}} to Saint Francis <b>of</b> <b>Assisi</b> which was built in Galata during his reign. In a third theory, proposed by Giuseppe Gerola, a tomb decorated with the Latin Empire coat of arms in Assisi's Lower Basilica may have been built for John by Walter VI, Count of Brienne.|$|E
5|$|Both of Cimabue's {{surviving}} crucifixes {{were commissioned}} by the Franciscan order. Founded by Saint Francis <b>of</b> <b>Assisi,</b> their reformist, religious and social views {{had a profound effect}} on the visual arts in the century after his death. The son of a wealthy cloth merchant, Francis abandoned his inheritance to take up preaching in his mid-twenties. He venerated poverty and developed a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature. Byzantine depictions tended to show Christ as invincible, even in death. Imagery based on Franciscan ideals in the thirteenth century generally reinforce his veneration of simplicity and naturalism, infusing the paintings with the new values of humanism.|$|E

5|$|Caprioli's {{memorial}} {{was broken}} {{up in the}} nineteenth century, so only the Caprioli Adoration remains. A masterpiece of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis <b>of</b> <b>Assisi</b> church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical mastery, {{not only in the}} extremely precise orientation of the boxes, but also in the choice of the monolithic block, which, in fact, is not strictly necessary for this kind of work. From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, we know that the relief was placed by some architectural system. It {{was supposed to be a}} figurative piece, created perhaps by the same artist, but which has not been traced.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{the church}} of St. Claires in Hakin closed, leaving one Roman Catholic church in Milford Haven, St. Francis <b>of</b> <b>Assisi</b> on Priory Road. Baptists congregate at North Road Baptist Church {{which is one of}} the older {{religious}} buildings of the community, built in 1878. The Friends Meeting House (Quakers), built in 1811 by the original Quaker whalers who were central to the early growth of the town, is in Priory Road. Quakers travel from distances around Pembroke to worship at the Friends House.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 13th century mendicant orders were founded by Francis <b>of</b> <b>Assisi</b> and Dominic de Guzmán. The studia conventualia and studia generalia of the mendicant orders played {{a large role}} in the {{transformation}} of Church sponsored cathedral schools and palace schools, such as that of Charlemagne at Aachen, into the prominent universities of Europe. Scholastic theologians and philosophers such as the Dominican priest Thomas Aquinas studied and taught at these studia. Aquinas' Summa Theologica was an intellectual milestone in its synthesis of the legacy of Ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle with the content of Christian revelation.|$|E

5|$|Like other Florentines {{of their}} {{financial}} means, Francesco's {{family members were}} art lovers and patrons. His son Bartolomeo asked Antonio di Donnino Mazzieri to paint a fresco at the family's burial site in the Basilica della Santissima Annunziata di Firenze. Andrea del Sarto painted a Madonna for another member of his family. Francesco gave commissions to Leonardo for a portrait {{of his wife and}} to Domenico Puligo for a painting of Saint Francis <b>of</b> <b>Assisi.</b> He is thought to have commissioned Lisa's portrait to celebrate both Andrea's birth and the purchase of the family's home.|$|E
5|$|Nailsea Methodist Church {{was founded}} in 1789; the first {{building}} opened three years later. In 1914 a new chapel was opened on Silver Street, and a youth club was added in the 1960s. In early 1992 the old church was replaced with a larger, flexible, multi-purpose building and the youth club was refurbished and renamed the Wesley Centre after Methodism’s founder, John Wesley. There is also Nailsea Baptist Church, the Catholic Church of St Francis <b>of</b> <b>Assisi,</b> Southfield Church, the United Reformed Church and the Community Church.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} show {{a famous}} incident {{from the life}} of Saint Francis <b>of</b> <b>Assisi,</b> who is shown kneeling by a rock as he receives the stigmata of the crucified Christ on the palms of his hands and soles of his feet. Behind him are rock formations, shown in great detail, and a panoramic landscape that seems to relegate the figures to secondary importance. This treatment of Francis is the first such to appear in northern Renaissance art. The arguments attributing the works to van Eyck are circumstantial and based mainly on the style and quality of the panels. A later, third version is in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, but is weaker and strays significantly in tone and design.|$|E
