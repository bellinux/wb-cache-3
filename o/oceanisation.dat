50|$|The {{maximum depth}} of the Mohorovicic Discontinuity in the Aquitanian Basin is 36 km, {{following}} {{more or less the}} path of the Garonne River. Towards the Massif Central in the northeast, the discontinuity flattens out to 30 km. The same holds for approaching the northern edge of the Pyrenees, here the discontinuity is also at 30 km depth. In the oceanic part of the Parentis Basin, it is already encountered at 20 km depth. This implies a significant stretching of the continental crust and the beginning of <b>oceanisation.</b> As a comparison, underneath the Central Pyrenees the continental crust is 50 km thick.|$|E
50|$|During the Upper Jurassic, a rift was {{propagating}} {{from the}} spreading Central Atlantic along the continental margin of northwestern France towards Aquitaine. This happened probably {{as early as}} the Tithonian. As a consequence, the rift wedged Iberia southward and separated it from the Armorican Massif. In the wake, the continental crust was thinned and eventually oceanic crust was beginning to form in the Middle Aptian—the opening of the Bay of Biscay was under way. Final <b>oceanisation</b> of the Bay of Biscay was achieved by Santonian/Campanian times (about 84 million years ago as witnessed by the magnetic polarity chron C 34). Paleomagnetic studies additionally show an anticlockwise 35° rotation of Iberia. The drifting motion of Iberia had taken up the entire Lower Cretaceous. Due to the rotational motion, the northeastern edge of Iberia started to interfere with Aquitania, first creating transtensional pull-aparts along the North Pyrenean Zone in the Middle Albian. The crustal thinning associated with the transtensional rifting process led to HT/LP metamorphism in the North Pyrenean Zone, its onset being dated at about 108 million years ago. At the same time, the lherzolites were finally emplaced. The transcurrent motion along the North Pyrenean pull-apart zone was also accompanied by alkaline magmatism that lasted from the Middle Albian {{to the end of the}} Coniacian. The slow progression of the metamorphism into the west seems to imply a large sinistral shearing between Iberia and Aquitania, estimated as an offset of about 200 km (the metamorphism reached the Basque Country only about 80 million years ago in the Campanian).|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Jurassic Karoo large igneous {{province}} {{consists of}} {{vast quantities of}} basaltic lava-flows, giant dike swarms and poorly dated silicic magmatism. The Karoo magmatism occurred over more than 3 x 106 km² and {{was associated with the}} opening of the Indian Ocean. We present new 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronological data concerning the easternmost part (i. e. the Mwenezi and Lebombo areas) of the Karoo province, close to the future rifted margin. These data allow documenting the final history of the province and the time elapsed between the end of the Karoo magmatism and the inception of <b>oceanisation.</b> This important type of information is poorly constrained for most of the large igneous provinces. Eighteen plagioclase separates yielded 14 plateau and « mini-plateau » ages obtained on 3 basaltic dikes (178. 1 ± 1. 1 to 177. 2 ± 2. 4 Ma; 2 σ), 3 gabbroic (178. 2 ± 1. 7 to 176. 8 ± 0. 7 Ma) and 2 silicic (175. 8 ± 0. 7 to 174. 4 ± 0. 7 Ma) plutons and 1 rhyolitic lava-flow (177. 8 ± 0. 7 Ma). We also obtained three concordant plateau and mini-plateau ages ranging from 173. 9 ± 0. 7 Ma to 172. 1 ± 2. 3 Ma on the atypical E-MORB-like N-S striking Rooi Rand dikes. One dike from the Save-Limpopo N 70 °-oriented giant dike swarm provides a mini-plateau age of 177. 7 ± 0. 8 Ma in agreement with the dates previously determined on this branch and possibly assessing the same age and short duration (≤ 1 - 2 Myr) as for the 179 Ma giant Okavango dike swarm. New and previous selected age data obtained on the Karoo province show that the magmatism was active over ca. 10 Myr from 184 to 174 Ma. The main basaltic phase occurred mostly over the first ~ 5 Myr and was progressively followed by a more differentiated and less voluminous magmatism over the last 4 Myr. The easternmost Lebombo-Mwenezi long lasting magmatism is interpreted as being triggered by the progressive lithospheric extension preceding the continental disruption. The transition from rifting to <b>oceanisation</b> is probably illustrated by the E-MORB-like Rooi Rand dikes which are likely to be emplaced during or shortly after the final stage of the Karoo magmatism. A geodynamic evolution of the province is proposed. These data indicate that the Karoo magmatism represents an atypical province (admitting that other large igneous provinces are sufficiently known) with a long lasting and relatively low-emission rate magmatic activity. It appears from a re-evaluation of major Phanerozoic Continental Flood Basalts (CFBs), that for most of them, including the Karoo, the onset of <b>oceanisation</b> shortly follows (or is coeval to) the latest CFB-related activity more closely than previously thought...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{reassess}} the geodynamic context {{close to}} the Congo craton during the pre-collisional period of the Pan-African orogeny from whole-rock major and trace element compositions and isotopic data obtained in the westward extension of the Yaounde series (Boumnyebel area, Cameroon). The series consists of metasediments (micaschists, minor calc-silicate rocks and marbles) and meta-igneous rocks (hornblende gneisses, amphibolites, metagabbros, pyroxenites and talcschists) recrystallized under high-pressure conditions. Chemically, the micaschists correspond to shales and greywackes similar to the Yaounde high-grade gneisses. 87 Sr/ 86 Sr initial ratios (0. 7084 – 0. 7134), moderately negative εNd(620 Ma) values (− 5. 75 to − 7. 81), Nd model ages (1. 66 < TDM < 1. 74 Ga) and radiometric ages point {{to the conclusion that}} the Yaounde basin was filled with siliciclastic sediments derived from both reworked older continental crust (Palaeoproterozoic to Archaean in age) and Neoproterozoic juvenile volcanogenic material. This occurred in the same time span (625 – 1100 Ma) as the deposition of the Lower Dja, Yokadouma, Nola and Mintom series (Tonian–Cryogenian). Dolomitic marble associated with mafic/ultramafic rocks and characterized by high Cr (854 – 1371 ppm) and Ni (517 – 875 ppm) contents, are considered to result from chemical precipitation in relation with submarine magmatic activity. Talcschists (orthopyroxenitic to harzburgitic in composition) show primitive-mantle-normalized multi-element patterns with significant negative Nb–Ta anomalies, and slopes similar to that of average metasomatically altered lithospheric mantle. These rocks could be mantle slices involved in the collision tectonics. Amphibolites show the compositions of island-arc basalts with systematic negative Nb–Ta anomalies, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr initial ratios mostly < 0. 7047 and positive εNd(620 Ma) values (+ 1. 41 to + 6. 58). They are considered to be the expression of incipient <b>oceanisation</b> to the north of the Congo craton during the early Neoproterozoic. Hornblende gneisses show andesitic compositions, with high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr initial ratios (0. 7105 and 0. 7125) and low εNd(620) values (− 14. 0 and − 20. 7) suggesting that their genesis involved juvenile and recycled older crustal materials. Syn-metamorphic metagabbro (Mamb) and metadiorite (Yaounde) intrusions show negative Nb–Ta negative anomalies but enrichment in light rare-earth and large-ion lithophile elements, suggesting a metasomatized mantle source. Overall, meta-igneous rocks seem to be representative of distinct magmatic events that accompanied the evolution of the Yaounde sedimentary basin, from opening and <b>oceanisation</b> to convergence and closure in relation with the collisional process. These data suggest that the Yaounde basin should not be considered as a back-arc basin, but more likely represents the expression of extensional processes to the north of the Congo craton, which led to rifting, fragmentation and limited <b>oceanisation.</b> In this view, the Adamawa-Yade block may represent a micro-continent detached from the Congo craton during the early Neoproterozoic...|$|E
40|$|The {{similarity}} between the geometry of the West African and South American coastlines is among {{one of the strongest}} natural observations supporting the plate tectonic paradigm. However, using classical plate tectonic approaches to model these conjugate transform margins results in a high degree of variability in palaeogeographic reconstructions. Using state-of-the-art 3 D coupled thermo-mechanical numerical models, we simulate for the first time, crustal deformation at the onset of <b>oceanisation</b> along large offset oblique margins. Our models show that obliquity causes oceanic rift propagation to stall, resulting in an apparent polyphased tectonic evolution, and in some circumstances leads to the formation of hyper-extended margins. As a result, conjugate margins located at the edge of future fracture zones are highly asymmetric from rifting to spreading, with their lengths differing by a factor of 5 to 10, before the the final phase of break-up occurs. Accounting for this discrepancy should ameliorate future palaeogeographic reconstructions...|$|E
40|$|The South America-Antarctica plate system shows many oceanic accretionary {{systems and}} {{subduction}} zones that initiated and then stopped. To better apprehend {{the evolution of}} the system, geodynamic reconstructions (global) have been created from Jurassic (165 Ma) to present, following the techniques used at the University of Lausanne. However, additional synthetic magnetic anomalies were used to refine the geodynamics between 33 Ma and present. The reconstructions show the break up of Gondwana with <b>oceanisation</b> between South America (SAM) and Antarctica (ANT), together with the break off of `Andean' geodynamical units (GDUs). We propose that <b>oceanisation</b> occurs also east and south of the Scotian GDUs. Andean GDUs collide with other GDUs crossing the Pacific. The west coast of SAM and ANT undergo a subsequent collision with all those GDUs between 103 Ma and 84 Ma, and the Antarctic Peninsula also collides with Tierra del Fuego. The SAM-ANT plate boundary experienced a series of extension and shortening with large strike-slip component, culminating with intra-oceanic subduction leading to the presence of the `V-' and anomalies in the Weddell Sea. From 84 Ma, a transpressive collision takes place in the Scotia region, with active margin to the east. As subduction propagates northwards into an old and dense oceanic crust, slab roll-back initiates, giving rise to the western Scotia Sea and the Powell Basin opening. The Drake Passage opens. As the Scotian GDUs migrate eastwards, there is enough space for them to spread and allow a north-south divergence with a spreading axis acting simultaneously with the western Scotia ridge. Discovery Bank stops the migration of South Orkney and `collides with' the SAM-ANT spreading axis, while the northern Scotian GDUs are blocked against the Falkland Plateau and the North-East Georgia Rise. The western and central Scotia and the Powell Basin spreading axes must cease, and the ridge jumps to create the South Sandwich Islands Sea. The Tierra del Fuego-Patagonia region has always experienced mid-oceanic ridge subduction since 84 Ma. Slab window location is also presented (57 - 0 Ma), because of its important implication for heat flux and magmatism. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|A {{succession}} of mid-ocean ridge basalts (linked at their base to serpentinite slivers) with intercalations of chert levels of Middle and Late Triassic, {{as well as}} Early and Middle Jurassic ages have been recently found in the Argolis Peninsula, Greece. This succession is very similar and has a tectonic position comparable with the Triassic basalts of the “Volcano-sedimentary Formation” {{at the top of}} the “Rubik Complex” of the Mirdita Ophiolitic Nappe in Albania. Moreover, Argolis and Mirdita ophiolites pertain to the same ophiolitic belt, which extends from Mirdita to Pindos, Vourinos, Othris and Argolis. The “Volcano-sedimentary Formation” was previously interpreted by as an Upper Jurassic sequence which “precède de peu ou accompagne le début de l’ouverture (<b>océanisation)</b> proprement dite du domaine ophiolitique de Mirdita”. Bortolotti et al. (1996) confirmed this interpretation (“the sequence can be interpreted as a product of syn-rift, subalkaline magmatism associated with thinning of the continental margin during the Middle Triassic” but, on the base of the radiolarian stratigraphy, retro-dated the sequence to the Middle and Late Triassic times. The aim of this article is to assess the petrology and tectono-magmatic significance of basalts from this complex in the northern Albania Mirdita zone in relation to their age of formation, for providing new data for a more detailed reconstruction of the Triassic events...|$|E
40|$|Through {{a review}} of {{literature}} and new data we have documented two major events in the Palaeoproterozoic history of stromatolites as indicated by palaeontological and palaeoenvironmental studies. With a time resolution of between 40 and 200 Ma we confirm Semikhatov and Raaben's, and Awramik's (albeit approximately) maximum in diversity and abundance of stromatolites between 2330 and 2060 Ma ago (Jatulian diversification). We suggest that this taxonomic diversity was driven by a major phase of cratonisation, formation of the Karelian carbonate platform and numerous rift-related shallow-water carbonate basins supersaturated with Ca + 2, Mg + 2 and CO 2. The Jatulian stromatolite explosion is synchronised with a positive &# 948; 13 C carb shift of Jatulian age carbonates. We also document stromatolite decline which occurred on the Fennoscandian Shield somewhere between 2060 and 1900 Ma ago. This decline, both in abundance and in taxonomic diversity, is interpreted as having been caused by {{the first phase of}} 'oceanisation'. The <b>oceanisation</b> led to the considerable reduction in ecological niches that could be utilised by cyanobacteria. The post-Jatulian decline of stromatolites coincides with an abrupt, downward &# 948; 13 C org shift from - 19 % to - 38 % and is roughly coeval with the appearance of the first eukaryotic algae documented elsewhere. The systematics of the Fennoscandian diversity of Palaeoproterozoic stromatolites is identical to that reported from India and China and reveals a dissimilarity with abundance and diversity patterns in Australia and Northern America...|$|E
40|$|New plate-tectonic reconstructions of the Gondwana margin {{suggest that}} the {{location}} of Gondwana-derived terranes should not only be guided by the models, but should also consider the possible detrital input from some Asian blocks (Hunia), {{supposed to have been}} located along the Cambrian Gondwana margin, and accreted in the Silurian to the North-Chinese block. Consequently, the Gondwana margin has to be subdivided into a more western domain, where the future Avalonian blocks will be separated from Gondwana by the opening Rheic Ocean, whereas in its eastern continuation, hosting the future basement areas of Central Europe, different periods of crustal extension should be distinguished. Instead of applying a rather cylindrical model, it is supposed that crustal extension follows a much more complex pattern, where local back-arcs or intra-continental rifts are involved. Guided by the age data of magmatic rocks and the pattern of subsidence curves, the following extensional events can be distinguished: – During the early to middle Cambrian, a back-arc setting guided the evolution at the Gondwana margin. Contemporaneous intra-continental rift basins developed at other places related to a general post-Pan-African extensional phase affecting Africa – Upper Cambrian formation of oceanic crust is manifested in the Chamrousse area, and may have lateral cryptic relics preserved in other places. This is regarded as the <b>oceanisation</b> of some marginal basins in a context of back-arc rifting. These basins were closed in a mid-Ordovician tectonic phase, related to the subduction of buoyant material (mid-ocean ridge?) – Since the Early Ordovician, a new phase of extension is observed, accompanied by a large-scale volcanic activity, erosion of the rift shoulders generated detritus (Armorican Quartzite) and the rift basins collected detrital zircons from a wide hinterland. This phase heralded the opening of Palaeotethys, but it failed due to the Silurian collision (Eo-Variscan phase) of an intra-oceanic arc with the Gondwana margin. During this time period, at the eastern wing of the Gondwana margin begins the drift of the future Hunia microcontinents, through the opening of an eastern prolongation of the already existing Rheic Ocean. The passive margin of the remaining Gondwana was composed of the Galatian superterranes, constituents of the future Variscan basement areas. Remaining under the influence of crustal extension, they will start their drift to Laurussia since the earliest Devonian during the opening of the Palaeotethys Ocean...|$|E
40|$|The Central Atlantic magmatic {{province}} (CAMP) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} igneous provinces on Earth (> 107 km²) and spanning four continents. Recent high-precision 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of mineral separates has provided important constraints on the age, duration, and geodynamic history of CAMP. Yet, the North American CAMP is strikingly under-represented in this dating effort. Here we present 13 new statistically robust plateau, mini-plateau and isochron ages obtained on plagioclase and sericite separates from lava flows from the Fundy (n = 10; Nova Scotia, Canada) and Hartford and Deerfield (n = 3; U. S. A.) basins. Ages mostly range from 198. 6 ± 1. 1 to 200. 1 ± 1. 4 Ma (2 σ), with 1 date substantially younger at 190. 6 ± 1. 0 Ma. Careful statistical regression shows that ages from the upper (199. 7. 0 ± 1. 5 Ma) and bottom (200. 1 ± 0. 9 Ma) units of the lava pile in the Fundy basin are statistically indistinguishable, confirming a short duration emplacement (<< 1. 8 Ma; ≤ 1 Ma). Three ages obtained on the Hartford (198. 6 ± 2. 0 Ma and 199. 8 ± 1. 1 Ma) and Deerfield (199. 3 ± 1. 2 Ma) basins were measured on sericite from the upper lava flow units. We interpret these dates as reflecting synemplacement hydrothermal activity within these units. Collectively, CAMP ages gathered so far suggest a short duration of the main magmatic activity (2 - 3 Ma), but also suggest the possibility of a temporal migration of the active magmatic centers from north to south. Such a migration challenges a plume model that would postulate a radial outward migration of the magmatism and is more compatible with other models such as the supercontinent global warming hypothesis. When compared to the age of the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, the filtered CAMP age database suggests that the onset of the magmatic activity precedes the limit by at least few hundred thousand years, therefore suggesting a causal relationship between CAMP and the end of Triassic mass extinction. An age at 191 Ma possibly suggests a minor CAMP late tailing activity (190 - 194 Ma) which has already observed for dykes and sills in Africa and Brazil. We speculate that, if real, this late activity can be due to a major extensional event, possibly heralding the <b>oceanisation</b> process at ~ 190 Ma. Comparison between high quality U/Pb and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages of pegmatite lenses from the North Mountain basalts confirms a ~ 1 % bias between the two chronometers. This discrepancy is likely attributed to the miscalibration of the 40 K decay constants, in particular the electron capture branch...|$|E
40|$|The {{records of}} the Jurassic Western Tethys Ocean are the ophiolitic rocks now {{scattered}} in the Tertiary orogenic belts of the Alps, Apennines and Betic Cordillera. These ophiolites, involved in a convergent margin environment, are affected I) by HP/LT metamorphism derived from a subduction process or II) by very low grade overprint, corresponding to the tectonic prism at {{the margin of the}} overriding plate. On the whole, they share a common MORB geochemical signature and “reduced” ophiolitic successions. In the thickest “complete” ophiolitic successions, basalt flows, generally thin, are preceded and followed by ophiolitic breccias. Only the basal portion of the breccias on top of the serpentinites (Levanto Breccias) has a tectonic origin, all other levels have a sedimentary origin. These breccia-basalt assemblages are overlain by thick sequences of Mt. Alpe Cherts and Calpionella Limestones, followed by Palombini Shales. In the reduced (or incomplete) successions, thin breccias and cherts were directly deposited, above the Levanto Breccias (ophicalcites pro parte), and followed by Palombini Shales. This stratigraphic pattern seems to be widespread in the whole Western Tethys ocean. In some sequences, transitional mid-ocean ridge (T-MOR) basalts are present and the ophiolitic rocks are associated with Variscan continental slices and debris, as in the Err-Platta succession (Central Alps) and in some exotic blocks in the flysch of the External Ligurides (Northern Apennines). In the Balagne (Corsica) T-MOR basalts are associated with quartzarenites. These occurrences show that an unroofed mantle and sections of oceanic crust evolved very near to a continental margin. The different radiolarian ages of the cherts deposited before, within, or on top of the MOR basalts allow to infer a minimum time interval for the Western Tethys <b>oceanisation.</b> This interval can be considered between 16 and 21 Ma (from Late Bajocian to Kimmeridgian/Tithonian). If we assume 1 cm/yr spreading rate during this time, the basin would have reached about 150 - 200 km width. The same ages suggest that the ocean opening was diachronous along the Western Tethys basin. Mainly {{on the basis of the}} Northern Apennines and Corsica data, it is possible to reconstruct the following evolutive geodynamic, paleogeographic and sedimentary evolution of the Western Tethys ocean basin: 1 - Bajocian/Bathonian stage: opening of the Ligurian Northern Apennines oceanic segment and, perhaps, also of the Ligurian, Western and Central Alps ones. 2 - Bathonian/Callovian stage: opening of all the segments of the Western Tethys ocean basin. The volcano-sedimentary covers formed during these two stages are constituted by breccias, basalts and siliceous pelagites (cherts). 3 - Tithonian/Berriasian: end of the ocean spreading (Tithonian) and beginning of the quiescent stage in the whole basin, marked by the lack of any tectonic activity and by the sedimentation of the Calpionella Limestones and, locally, of mixed siliceous-calcareous deposits (Nisportino-Murlo Fm.). 4 - Hauterivian/Santhonian: this is the longest quiescent stage of the basin, dominated by the sedimentation of the Palombini Shales and Limestones. Some siliciclastic deposits are shed from both passive continental margin sides. During the Early Cretaceous, there is also evidence of a rare intraplate magmatism in Southern Tuscany. The Western Tethys ophiolitic successions are similar to those of present day, slow spreading oceans, in particular to those of the Atlantic Ocean. The Galician North Atlantic margin provides a model for the process of mantle denudation. For the oceanic evolution, the model of Tucholke and Linn (1994) is particularly taken in consideration. According to this model, tectonic extension was one major process in the Western Tethys oceanic development...|$|E
