5|$|Pushing {{design to}} the limits, Simonovich-Efimova created puppets {{to be worn}} on the head, {{allowing}} the puppeteer to manipulate several characters simultaneously. She patented {{a new type of}} rod puppet with rods attached to the elbows to free up the hands. The rods were hidden behind hanging costumes. To make puppets look more lifelike, the Efimovs devised a system where the arms were elongated. Rods rather than the puppeteer's fingers were inserted into the glove to manipulate the arms, which were allowed to move by manipulating strings inside the body of the doll. Simonovich-Efimova utilized other apparatus, like springs in the body of a cat puppet to give it the flexibility of a live animal. These innovations allowed their finely formed, elegantly clad puppets to move about naturally, rather than with the stiff, jerky movements of their predecessors. In an era when almost all puppet performances were designed to entertain children or present government ideology, Simonovich-Efimova went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> perform shows for adults, including The Enchanted Pear Tree, Macbeth, and works by Molière and Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin. Though she also made adaptations in her work with fables to replace what were seen as outmoded ideas, like replacing serfs with young communist characters, Simonovich-Efimova's focus was on artistry, entertainment and professionalism. She also developed a new system of life-sized manikins, blurring the lines between puppetry and acting, when she danced on stage with her Petrushka. Between 1920 and 1940, the Efimovs performed between 1,500 and 2,000 puppet shows.|$|E

In retirement he was highly critical of regimes such as Sukarno's Indonesia which confiscated assets belonging to their former colonial rulers, and appears to have reverted somewhat to the right-wing views which he had espoused in the 1920s.|$|E

25|$|According to , {{the member}} {{of the royal family}} with the most {{responsibility}} in this affair is Henry, Duke of Anjou, the king's ambitious younger brother. Following the failed assassination attack against the Admiral de Coligny (which Wanegffelen attributes to the Guise family and Spain), the Italian advisers of Catherine de Medici undoubtedly recommended in the royal Council the execution of about fifty Protestant leaders. These Italians stood to benefit from the occasion by eliminating the Huguenot danger. Despite the firm opposition of the Queen Mother and the King, Anjou, Lieutenant General of the Kingdom, present at this meeting of the Council, could see a good occasion {{to make a name for}} himself with the government. He contacted the Parisian authorities and another ambitious young man, running out of authority and power, Duke Henri de Guise (whose uncle, the clear-sighted Charles, cardinal of Lorraine, was then detained in Rome). The Parisian St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre resulted from this conjunction of interests, and this offers a much better explanation as to why the men of the Duke of Anjou acted in the name of the Lieutenant General of the Kingdom, consistent with the thinking of the time, rather than in the name of the King. One can also understand why, the day after the start of the massacre, Catherine de Medici, through royal declaration of Charles IX, condemned the crimes, and threatened the Guise family with royal justice. But when Charles IX and his mother learned of the involvement of the duke of Anjou, and being so dependent on his support, they issued a second royal declaration, which while asking for an end to the massacres, credited the initiative with the desire of Charles IX to prevent a Protestant plot. Initially the coup d'état of the duke of Anjou was a success, but Catherine de Medici went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> deprive him from any power in France: she sent him with the royal army to remain in front of La Rochelle and then had him elected King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.|$|E

TV Week described Chris as being [...] "deeply conflicted" [...] over his decision to tell her about his sexuality. Mason said [...] "It's hard for Chris because he has a girlfriend who he's been with for some time. To try and tell someone in this situation would be really difficult". Summer initially takes the news well and plays it down, but when fellow student Natasha Williams (Valentina Novakovic) discovers that one of her classmates is gay, she goes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> find out who it is and expose them.

500|$|After her husband's accession, Louise {{developed}} many ties {{to senior}} ministers {{and became a}} powerful figure within the government {{as she began to}} command universal respect and affection. The queen went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> stay informed about political developments at court, and {{from the very beginning of}} his reign the new king consulted Louise on matters of state. Frederick William was hesitant and cautious, and hated war, stating in 1798, [...] "I abhor war and... know of nothing greater on earth than the preservation of peace and tranquility as the only system suited to the happiness of human kind". In keeping with the later foreign policy of his father's, Frederick William favored neutrality during the early years of the conflict with the revolutionary French First Republic, which evolved into the Napoleonic Wars (1803–15); he refused the various pressures to pick a side in the War of the Second Coalition. Louise supported this view, warning that if Prussia were to side with the coalition powers of Austria, Great Britain, and Russia, it would lead to dependence on the latter power for military support. She foresaw that because Prussia was by far the weakest of the great powers, and it would not have been able to ensure it benefited from the results of such an alliance. French aggression caused the king to eventually consider entering the wars, but his indecision prevented him from choosing a side, either France or the coalition powers. He consulted the many differing opinions of Queen Louise and his ministers, and was eventually compelled into an alliance with Napoleon, who was recently victorious from the Battle of Austerlitz (1805).|$|E
500|$|The {{night before}} her {{internship}} begins, Lexie meets Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) at Joe's Bar, mirroring his initial meeting with Meredith. The pair flirt, but Derek makes his excuses and leaves. On her {{arrival at the}} hospital, Lexie meets George O'Malley (T.R. Knight) who quickly realizes her identity. Lexie promises to keep George's secret that he is repeating his internship after failing his intern exam and the pair strike up a friendship. Lexie is assigned to be Cristina Yang's (Sandra Oh) intern, and is dubbed [...] "three" [...] by Cristina, who doesn't {{take the time to}} learn her name. Lexie is eager to get to know her half-sister Meredith, but receives a hostile response when she introduces herself, and her later frequent attempts to bond with Meredith are similarly rebuffed. Lexie begins a brief sexual relationship with Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), who discovers that Thatcher has descended into alcoholism following Susan's death. When Meredith scolds Lexie for not looking after Thatcher, she finally retaliates and decides to stop pursuing a relationship with Meredith. Lexie bonds with patient Nick Hanscom (Seth Green), and is present when his exposed artery blows, causing him to suffer massive blood loss. She manages to stop the bleeding, but is distraught when Nick later dies anyway. Feeling sympathy for Lexie, Cristina invites her to join her and Meredith in drinking and dancing, causing the sisters relationship to begin to thaw. The following morning, Meredith goes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> make Lexie breakfast, which she politely eats despite an allergy to eggs, resulting in her having to be treated at the hospital. Lexie and George agree to move in together, but they can only afford a dilapidated apartment which Lexie attempts to improve by stealing decorations from the hospital. She begins to develop romantic feelings for George, and discovers that he had only failed his intern exam by one point, encouraging him to try and convince the Chief that he deserves a second chance.|$|E

2500|$|On 16 March 1969, {{five years}} and twelve days after she left her husband, gravely ill, Meena Kumari {{reported}} for work again on Pakeezah. Kamal Amrohi organized a great reception. He gave his wife a peda (sweet) as a peace offering and made a documentary film on her arrival at the studio. Meena Kumari was determined to complete the film and, {{well aware of the}} limited time left for her to live, went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> complete it at the earliest. Despite her rapidly deteriorating health, she gave the finishing touches to her performance. Vinod Mehta (writer of Meena Kumari - The Classic Biography) shared an incident which occurred during {{the last days of the}} shooting of Pakeezah: [...] "On outdoor shooting Kamal Amrohi's unit travelled in two cars near a place called Shivpuri in Madhya Pradesh, the cars all but ran out of petrol, and for miles around there was nothing except a long, deserted, straight road. It was discovered that a bus passed on this route every morning from which fuel could be purchased. Kamal Amrohi decided to spend the night in the desert; he ordered his unit to roll up the windows of the cars and hope for the best. A little after midnight the occupants of the vehicles were surrounded by a dozen armed men. The men knocked on the closed windows and forced their way in. When the armed gang leader learned that one of the people in the car was Meena Kumari, his attitude completely changed. He turned out to be a Meena Kumari fan, and welcomed his guests in true fan tradition. He organized music, dancing, and food. He provided a place to sleep. He instructed his juniors the next morning to fetch petrol for the unit. From Meena Kumari, he wanted a special favor. He sharpened his knife and took it to her. [...] "Please autograph my hand with this", he requested. Meena was not new to signing autographs but she had never attempted anything as ambitious as a knife. Nervously, she wrote her name on this man's hand. He said he was grateful for this favor. Once the unit left, they found at the next town that they had spent the night in the camp of Madhya Pradesh's renowned and dangerous dacoit - Amrit Lal." ...|$|E

A kaleidoscope, whose three mirrors transform scraps of coloured paper into beautiful designs, provided an inspired illustration for the Holy Trinity. [...] "As long as our actions, even the smallest, do not fall away from the focus of Divine Love, the Holy Trinity, symbolized by the three mirrors, allows them to reflect wonderful beauty. Jesus, who regards us through the little lens, that is to say, through Himself, always sees beauty in everything we do. But if we left the focus of inexpressible love, what would He see? Bits of straw … dirty, worthless actions." [...] "Another cherished image was that of the newly invented elevator, a vehicle Thérèse used many times over to describe God's grace, a force that lifts us to heights we can't reach on our own." [...] Her sister Céline's memoir is filled with numerous examples of the teacher Thérèse. [...] "Céline: - 'Oh! When I think how much I have to acquire!' Thérèse: - 'Rather, how much you have to lose! Jesus Himself will fill your soul with treasures in the same measure that you move your imperfections out of the way." [...] And Céline recalled a story Thérèse told about egotism. 'The 28 month old Thérèse visited Le Mans and was given a basket filled with candies, at the top of which were two sugar rings. 'Oh! How wonderful! There is a sugar ring for Céline too!' On her way to the station however the basket overturned, and one of the sugar rings disappeared. 'Ah, I no longer have any sugar ring for poor Céline!' Reminding me of the incident she observed; 'See how deeply rooted in us is this self-love! Why was it Céline's sugar ring, and not mine, that was lost?' Martha of Jesus, a novice who spent her childhood in a series of orphanages and who was described by all as emotionally unbalanced, with a violent temper, gave witness during the beatification process of the 'unusual dedication and presence of her young teacher. [...] "Thérèse deliberately 'sought out the company of those nuns whose temperaments she found hardest to bear.' What merit was there in acting charitably toward people whom one loved naturally? Thérèse went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> spend time with, and therefore to love, the people she found repellent.
