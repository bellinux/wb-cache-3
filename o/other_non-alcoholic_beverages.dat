Methods We conducted a content analysis of America's top-ten grossing films from 1991 through 2000 that included portrayals of beverages (95 movies total). Coding reliabilities were assessed with Cohen's kappa, and exceeded 0. 80. If {{there was at least}} one instance of branding for a beverage, the film was considered having branded beverages. Fisher's exact test was used to determine if soft drink portrayals were related to audience rating or genre. Data on the amount of time soft drinks appeared onscreen was log transformed to satisfy the assumption of normality, and analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA model. McNemar's test of agreement was used to test whether branded soft drinks are as likely to appear or to be actor-endorsed compared to other branded beverages. Results Rating was not associated with portrayals of branded soft drinks, but comedies were most likely to include a branded soft drink (p = 0. 0136). Branded soft drinks appeared more commonly than <b>other</b> branded <b>non-alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> (p = 0. 0001), branded beer (p = 0. 0004), and other branded alcoholic beverages (p = 0. 0006).

40|$|Introduction and Aims:&# 8194;It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that mixing alcohol with energy drink (AmED) increases overall alcohol consumption. These results were based on between-groups analyses typically with relatively small samples sizes, comparing AmED consumers with people who consume alcohol only. The aims of the current surveys included the use of within-subjects analyses to determine whether AmED consumers consume more alcohol on AmED occasions when compared to alcohol only occasions. Design and Methods:&# 8194;An overview is presented of results from the Australian and UK replication of the Dutch Student Survey on mixing alcohol with energy drink and <b>other</b> <b>non-alcoholic</b> <b>beverages.</b> More than 10, 000 students participated in the surveys, allowing for a cross-cultural comparison. Results:&# 8194;Data from the individual and pooled studies revealed that AmED consumers do not consume more alcohol on AmED occasions when compared to alcohol only occasions. No relevant differences were observed on total alcohol consumption when mixing alcohol with energy drink (or <b>other</b> <b>non-alcoholic</b> <b>beverages).</b> Although cross-cultural differences were found regarding demographics, results from The Netherlands, Australia and UK were consistent in that mixing alcohol with energy drink has no relevant effect on total alcohol consumption. Additionally there were no relevant differences between energy drink and <b>other</b> <b>non-alcoholic</b> <b>beverages.</b> Discussion and Conclusions:&# 8194;The results of these well-powered and cross-cultural surveys suggest that mixing alcohol with energy drink has no effect on total alcohol consumption.

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare alcohol consumption when mixed with energy drinks versus <b>other</b> <b>non-alcoholic</b> <b>beverages.</b> Design and Methods: Data from the Utrecht Student Survey [1] was used to analyse alcohol consumption patterns of 1239 AMED consumers. Using within-subject comparisons, alcohol consumption of the past 30 days of AMED consumers was compared for occasions on which they: (i) consumed alcohol only, or consumed alcohol mixed with (ii) energy drink; or (ii) <b>other</b> <b>non-alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> (i. e. colas, tonic). Results: The average number of alcohol drinks on occasions of AMED consumption (5. 4 drinks), alcohol mixed with other nonalcoholic beverages occasions (5. 1 drinks), and alcohol only occasions (6. 0 drinks) showed no relevant differences. When compared to AMED occasions, when mixing alcohol with other no-alcoholic beverages a significant increase was seen in number of drinking days (2. 5 vs. 1. 4), days drunk (0. 8 vs. 0. 5), days with more than 5 (males) / 4 (females) alcoholic drinks (1. 5 vs. 0. 9), and the greatest number of alcoholic drinks consumed (5. 4 vs. 4. 5). Discussion and Conclusions: No relevant differences in alcohol consumption where observed when mixing alcohol with energy drink or <b>other</b> <b>non-alcoholic</b> <b>beverages.</b> Implications for Practice or Policy: Focus on energy drinks seems not warranted, since mixing alcohol with energy drinks (or <b>other</b> <b>non-alcoholic</b> <b>beverages)</b> has no relevant impact on overall alcohol consumption.

Design and Methods: Data from the Utrecht Student Survey [1] was used to analyse motives for alcohol consumption of 1239 AMED consumers. Using within-subject comparisons, 13 neutral or negative motives for AMED and AMO consumption were compared. Results: Most frequently endorsed motives for consumption of AMED versus AMO were “I like the taste” (81. 1 % vs. 90. 2 %) (5. 4 vs. 4. 5), “I wanted to drink something else” (35. 5 % vs. 42. 9 %), and “To celebrate a special occasion, party” (14. 6 % vs. 14. 9 %). Negative reasons were endorsed by a minority of students. No significant differences were found for AMED versus AMO on the motives “It feels like... reduces the negative effects of alcohol” (6. 9 % vs. 5. 1 %), “It feels like I can drink more alcohol” (5. 6 % vs. 6. 5 %). Energy drinks were significantly less often consumed “To get drunk” (8. 0 vs. 10. 9 %), “To prevent getting drunk” (3. 8 % vs. 9. 0 %) or “To sober up” (2. 9 vs. 6. 0 %).

40|$|Introduction and Aims:&# 8194;A {{national}} {{online survey}} was conducted {{in order to assess}} alcohol consumption and its consequences when consumed alone or when mixed with energy drinks or <b>other</b> <b>non-alcoholic</b> <b>beverages.</b> A specific aim of the survey was to make within-subjects comparisons of overall alcohol consumption by comparing nights when alcohol only was consumed in contrast to alcohol mixed with energy drink. Design and Methods:&# 8194;This online survey was a partial replication of the Dutch and Australian Student Surveys on mixing alcohol with energy drinks and <b>other</b> <b>non-alcoholic</b> <b>beverages.</b> The survey was advertised through University Student Union social media throughout the UK. Responses were received from across the UK and contrasted with the earlier surveys which were regionally based (Melbourne, Utrecht). Results:&# 8194;Preliminary analysis from 1873 students revealed statistically significant comparisons (P&# 8201;<&# 8201; 0. 05) including the following. Those who consumed alcohol mixed with energy drinks (AmED, n&# 8201;=&# 8201; 732) drank more alcohol on alcohol only drinking sessions than students who only consumed alcohol. However, AmED consumers drank less alcohol on &# 8216;mixing&# 8217; nights in comparison to their alcohol only nights. Discussion and Conclusions:&# 8194;These preliminary results from the UK were similar to some earlier research (e. g. from the USA) where researchers found increased alcohol consumption amongst students who consumed AmED. However, this research was also in keeping with specific within-subjects surveys from Australia and the Netherlands in that students who consumed AmED did not drink more, but drank less on their &# 8216;mixing&# 8217; nights. Therefore AmED consumption was not associated with increased alcohol intake. Implications for Practice or Policy:&# 8194;Between groups differences in consumption were not triggered by AmED consumption on drinking nights. Policies should focus on non-AmED factors in reducing student alcohol consumption. Acknowledgment:&# 8194;This survey was supported by Red Bull...|$|E

This online survey was conducted in June 2011 by 6002 students living in Utrecht, The Netherlands. The aim of the survey {{was to determine the}} potential impact of mixing alcoholic beverages with energy drinks on overall alcohol consumption and alcohol-related consequences. In contrast to most previous surveys conducted on this topic, the current survey used a more appropriate within-subject design, comparing the alcohol consumption of individuals who consume alcohol mixed with energy drinks on occasions. Specifically, a comparison was conducted to examine the occasions during which these individuals consume this mixture versus occasions during which they consume alcohol alone. In addition to energy drinks, the consumption of other non-alcoholic mixers was also assessed when combined with alcoholic beverages. Furthermore, the reasons for consuming energy drinks alone or in combination with alcohol were investigated, and were compared to reasons for mixing alcohol with <b>other</b> <b>non-alcoholic</b> <b>beverages.</b> Finally, personality characteristics and the level of risk-taking behavior among the individuals were also assessed to explore their relationship with alcohol consumption.

40|$|Eating out {{has been}} linked to the current obesity epidemic, but the {{evaluation}} {{of the extent to which}} out of home (OH) dietary intakes are different from those at home (AH) is limited. Data collected among 8849 men and 14 277 women aged 35 - 64 years from the general population of eleven European countries through 24 -h dietary recalls or food diaries were analysed to: (1) compare food consumption OH to those AH; (2) describe the characteristics of substantial OH eaters, defined as those who consumed 25 % or more of their total daily energy intake at OH locations. Logistic regression models were fit to identify personal characteristics associated with eating out. In both sexes, beverages, sugar, desserts, sweet and savoury bakery products were consumed more OH than AH. In some countries, men reported higher intakes of fish OH than AH. Overall, substantial OH eating was more common among men, the younger and the more educated participants, but was weakly associated with total energy intake. The substantial OH eaters reported similar dietary intakes OH and AH. Individuals who were not identified as substantial OH eaters reported consuming proportionally higher quantities of sweet and savoury bakery products, soft drinks, juices and <b>other</b> <b>non-alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> OH than AH.

40|$|Introduction: A UK student survey {{examined}} the motivations for consuming energy drinks alone and mixed with alcohol, and aimed {{to determine whether}} the type of motive had a differential effect on overall alcohol consumption. Methods: The online survey (N = 1873) assessed alcohol consumption and motivations for consumption when mixed with energy drinks (AMED) and mixed with <b>other</b> <b>non-alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> (AMOB) using a within-subject design. Results: The most frequent neutral motives reported for AMED consumption included "I like the taste" (66. 5 %), and "to celebrate a special occasion" (35. 2 %). 52. 6 % of AMED consumers reported consuming AMED for at least one of five negative motives, primarily "to get drunk" (45. 6 %). Despite these negative motives those students reported consuming significantly less alcohol and fewer negative alcohol-related consequences on AMED occasions compared to alcohol-only (AO) occasions. Although the motives for consuming AMED and AMOB were comparable, more participants reported consuming AMED "to celebrate a special occasion", "to get drunk", because they "received the drink from someone else" or "because others drink it as well". However, significantly more students reported consuming AMOB than AMED because "It feels like I can drink more alcohol". Alcohol consumption was significantly less on AMED occasions compared to AMOB occasions, and both occasions significantly less than AO occasions. Conclusion: The majority of reasons for consuming AMED relate to neutral motives. Although 52. 6 % of students reported one or more negative motives for AMED consumption (predominantly "to get drunk") this had no differential effect on total alcohol consumption.

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the association of dietary sugars from different sources [beverages (liquids), foods (solids), extrinsic (free) or intrinsic (non-free) ] with metabolic and inflammatory markers. Methods Population-based cross-sectional study of adults in the East of England (n = 9678). Sugar intakes were estimated using food frequency questionnaires. Fasting glycated haemoglobin, glucose, insulin, and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) were measured and indices of metabolic risk were derived (homeostatic model of insulin resistance, HOMA-IR and metabolic risk z-score). Results In multiple linear regression analyses adjusted for potential confounders including BMI and TEI, sugars from liquids were positively associated with ln-CRP [b-coefficient (95 %CI), 0. 14 (0. 05, 0. 22) per 10 %TEI] and metabolic risk z-score [0. 13 (0. 07, 0. 18) ]. Free sugars were positively associated with ln-HOMA-IR [0. 05 (0. 03, 0. 08) ] and metabolic risk z-score [0. 09 (0. 06, 0. 12) ]. Sugars from solids were not associated with any outcome. Among major dietary contributors to intakes (g/d), sugars in fruit, vegetables, dairy products/egg dishes, cakes/biscuits/confectionary and squash/juice drinks were not associated, but sugar added to tea, coffee, cereal was significantly positively associated with all outcomes. Sugars in 100 % juice [0. 16 (0. 06, 0. 25) per 10 %TEI] and <b>other</b> <b>non-alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> [0. 13 (0. 03, 0. 23) ] were positively associated with metabolic risk z-score.
