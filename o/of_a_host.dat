Such larvae have soft bodies with no limbs, and have a blind gut (presumably so that they do not foul their cell).|$|E

5|$|Commoners {{known as}} guests and {{retainers}} (binke 賓客) {{who lived on}} the property <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> in exchange for services had existed since the Warring States period. Retainers often originally belonged to other social groups, and sometimes they were fugitives seeking shelter from authorities. Hosts were often wealthy nobles and officials, yet they were sometimes wealthy commoners. In a typical relationship, a host provided lodging, food, clothing, and carriage transport for his retainers in return for occasional and non-routine work or services such as an advisory role, a post as bodyguard, menial physical labor around the house, and sometimes more dangerous missions such as committing assassinations, fighting off roving bandits, or riding into battle to defend the host. Others could work as spies, scholarly protégés, or astrologers.|$|E

5|$|Ficus aurea is {{a fast-growing}} tree. As a hemi{{epiphyte}} it germinates in the canopy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> tree and begin {{life as an}} epiphyte before growing roots down to the ground. F. aurea is also a strangler fig (not all hemiepiphytic figs are stranglers)—the roots fuse and encircle the host tree. This usually results {{in the death of}} the host tree, since it effectively girdles the tree. Palms, which lack secondary growth, are not affected by this, but they can still be harmed by competition for light, water and nutrients. Following Hurricane Andrew in 1992, F. aurea trees regenerated from root suckers and standing trees.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal {{transmission}} {{is the most}} common mechanism of spread of viruses in populations. Transmission can occur when: body fluids are exchanged during sexual activity, e.g., HIV; blood is exchanged by contaminated transfusion or needle sharing, e.g., hepatitis C; exchange of saliva by mouth, e.g., Epstein–Barr virus; contaminated food or water is ingested, e.g., norovirus; aerosols containing virions are inhaled, e.g., influenza virus; and insect vectors such as mosquitoes penetrate the skin <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>host,</b> e.g., dengue.|$|E
5|$|The Shalya Parva of the Mahabharata {{mentions}} characteristics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> of Matrikas, {{who serve}} Skanda. Ninety-two {{of them are}} named but the text says there exist more. The Shalya Parva describes them as young, cheerful, most of them fair but having dangerous features like long nails and large teeth. They are said to fight like Indra in battles, invoking terror in minds of enemies; speak different foreign tongues and lives in inaccessible places away from human settlements like crossroads, caves, mountains, springs, forests, riverbanks and cremation grounds. Notable among these lists of Matrikas is Putana, a goddess who tried to kill the infant Krishna (an incarnation of Vishnu) by suckling him with poisoned breast milk and consequently killed by Krishna.|$|E

5|$|The design {{architecture}} of USB is asymmetrical in its topology, consisting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>host,</b> {{a multitude of}} downstream USB ports, and multiple peripheral devices connected in a tiered-star topology. Additional USB hubs may {{be included in the}} tiers, allowing branching into a tree structure with up to five tier levels. A USB host may implement multiple host controllers and each host controller may provide one or more USB ports. Up to 127 devices, including hub devices if present, may be connected to a single host controller. USB devices are linked in series through hubs. One hub—built into the host controller—is the root hub.|$|E
5|$|Legend of Mana {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} world of Fa'Diel. The Mana Tree, the giver of mana and life for the world, burned down almost entirely nine centuries prior to the events of the game. A war erupted between faeries, human, and others seeking the scarce power of mana that was left. When the war concluded, the burnt Mana Tree slept as it regrew and the many lands of the world were stored in ancient artifacts. A hero, {{controlled}} by the player, is self-charged with restoring the world, and mana, to its former self. The Lands of Fa'Diel are populated with a large number of different creatures, including humans, faeries, demons, the jewel-hearted Jumi race, plant-like Sproutlings and Flowerlings, miner bears called Dudbears, and shadowy beings of the Underworld known as Shadoles. Fa'Diel is also the home <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> of anthropomorphic animals and objects, as well as monsters from other Mana titles such as Rabites, Chobin Hoods, and Goblins. The player controls the protagonist of the game, who is either a male or female silent protagonist. The character is unnamed and no information is given about their past; their history and personality is meant to be determined by the player.|$|E

25|$|Viruses {{can remain}} intact from {{apoptosis}} {{in particular in}} the latter stages of infection. They can be exported in the apoptotic bodies that pinch off {{from the surface of}} the dying cell, and the fact that they are engulfed by phagocytes prevents the initiation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> response.

30|$|Upon {{receiving}} a Location Query, <b>a</b> <b>host</b> first looks into its location table for an answer. On <b>a</b> hit, this <b>host</b> {{responds to the}} issuer of this query with the copy found in its location table. On a miss, it forwards the query to <b>a</b> next-hop <b>host</b> for further service. The selection <b>of</b> <b>a</b> next-hop <b>host</b> makes <b>a</b> joint use <b>of</b> the peer-tree indexing structure and the underlying network connectivity.

50|$|RED is {{more fair}} than tail drop, {{in the sense}} that it does not possess a bias against bursty traffic that uses only <b>a</b> small portion <b>of</b> the bandwidth. The more <b>a</b> <b>host</b> transmits, the more likely it is that its packets are dropped as the {{probability}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>host's</b> packet being dropped is proportional to the amount of data it has in a queue. Early detection helps avoid TCP global synchronization.|$|R

25|$|Those parasites {{living in}} an {{intermediate}} position, being half-ectoparasites and half-endoparasites, are called mesoparasites. For example, the cod worm Lernaeocera branchialis invades the gill tissue <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> fish, but quickly grows a tubelike structure that cuts through the body tissues until it reaches the fish's heart, through which it robs the host of its blood. The rear end of the parasite remains outside, {{so that it can}} scatter eggs into the water.|$|E

40|$|Host-parasite {{interactions}} involve {{competition for}} nutritional resources between hosts and the parasites growing within them. Consuming part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>host's</b> resources is one cause <b>of</b> <b>a</b> parasite's virulence, i. e. {{part of the}} fitness cost imposed on the host by the parasite. The influence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>host's</b> nutritional conditions on the virulence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> parasite was experimentally tested using the mosquito Aedes aegypti and the microsporidian parasite Vavraia culicis. <b>A</b> condition-dependent expression <b>of</b> virulence was found and a positive relation between virulence and transmissibility was established. Spore production was positively influenced by host food availability, indicating that the parasite's within-host growth is limited by host condition. We also investigated how the fitness of each partner varied across the nutritional gradient and demonstrated that {{the sign of the}} correlation between host fitness and parasite fitness depended on the amount of nutritional resources available to the host...|$|R
