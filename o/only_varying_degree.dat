Both complexes exhibited not <b>only</b> <b>varying</b> <b>degree</b> of catalytic activity depending upon the relative mole ratio of two monomers but also characterize the types of coploymers. The former yields the polyene backbone containing only five-membered rings as well as PA while the latter produces the polymers consisting of both five- and six-membered ring structure. Comparative studies show that Mo(CO) 6 exhibits reactivity toward DEDPM alone, thus catalyzing initially metathesis cyclopoly-merization of DEDPM followed by copolymerization with PA while the (toluene) Mo(CO) 3 /chloranil system shows affinity for both PA and DEDPM...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Riley-Day Syndrome, {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} {{in which there}} is impaired ability or inability to feel pain, hot and cold, is cited as an example of evidence that the commonplace notion that life cannot be painless is not necessarily valid.

Two possible approaches whereby the human mind could be rendered painless are a schematically-outlined genetic approach, which would or will probably take thousands of years to implement, and a brain stimulation approach that could be effected by means of a noninvasive, contactless, transcranial, deep-neuroanatomic-site-focusable, electromagnetic and/or ultrasonic (and/or, conceivably, other kind of) brain pacemaker which could be developed within a few years. In order to expedite the relief of all kinds of suffering and the improvement of the human condition in general, it is advocated that prompt and concerted research effort be directed toward the development of such a brain pacemaker...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Concepts {{regarding}} the {{mechanisms by which}} drugs activate receptors to produce physiological response have progressed beyond considering the receptor as a simple on-off switch. Current {{evidence suggests that the}} idea that agonists produce <b>only</b> <b>varying</b> <b>degrees</b> of receptor activation is obsolete and must be reconciled with data to show that agonist efficacy has texture as well as magnitude. Thus, agonists can block system constitutive response (inverse agonists), behave as positive and inverse agonists on the same receptor (protean agonists), and differ in the stimulus pattern they produce in physiological systems (ligand-selective agonists). The molecular mechanism for this seemingly diverse array of activities is the same, namely, the selective microaffinity of ligands for different conformational states of the receptor. This paper reviews evidence for the existence of the various types of agonism and the potential therapeutic utility of different agonist types. —Kenakin, T.

40|$|PURPOSE: Certain {{regions of}} the talar {{trochlea}} are recognized as exhibiting varying cartilage thickness and degrees of subchondral bone mineralization. These changes {{have been attributed to}} the long-term loading history. For the current study, we accepted the hypothesis that stress-induced alterations of the joint surface include not <b>only</b> <b>varying</b> <b>degrees</b> of subchondral lamellar mineralization, but also structural changes of the subarticular cancellous bone. METHODS: In order to examine the structure of the subarticular cancellous bone, ten formalin-fixed talar trochleae were analyzed using micro CT. Sixteen measurement zones were defined and then evaluated in five layers each of 1 -mm thickness, enabling assessment of the cancellous architecture extending 5 mm below the trochlear surface using numerical and structural parameters. RESULTS: As with mineralization patterns in the subchondral lamella, large variation was observed regarding bone volume, trabecular quantity, thickness, and spacing, as well as for structure model index and degree of anisotropy, depending on localization. In addition, like previous reports examining mineralization of the subchondral lamella, two distinct groups could be identified as "bicentric" or "monocentric". CONCLUSIONS: These results show that structural tissue adaptation probably due to loading history is also evident within the subarticular cancellous bone...|$|R

The δ 18 O values of eclogites cover a wide range of - 4. 2 to + 8. 8 ‰, but the δD values of micas from the eclogites fall within a narrow range of - 87 to - 71 ‰. Both equilibrium and disequilibrium oxygen isotope fractionations were observed between quartz and the other minerals, with reversed fractionations between omphacite and garnet in some eclogite samples. The δ 18 O values of - 4 to - 1 ‰ for some of the eclogites represent the oxygen isotope compositions of their protoliths which underwent meteoric water-rock interaction before the high to ultrahigh pressure metamorphism. Hetetogeneous δ 18 O values for the eclogite protoliths implies not <b>only</b> the <b>varying</b> <b>degrees</b> of the water-rock interaction before the metamorphism at different localities, but also the channelized flow of fluids during progressive metamorphism due to rapid plate subduction.

40|$|Considerable {{progress}} has been made in identification and cloning of genes involved in plant defense responses. With the aid of plant molecular biology and biotechnology, a large number of antifungal proteins and peptides have been isolated and assessed through in vitro bioassays. Genes and gene products that are involved in signaling pathways have also been predicted. Strategies like enhancement of plant structural defense, neutralization of fungal toxins and exploitation of antifungal genes from non-plant sources have been used to produce transgenic plants. Exploitation of these approaches has shown significant reduction of fungal diseases in many cases. Moreover, using the knowledge gathered from characteristics of these transgenic plants, it has been possible to obtain better resistance. Co-expression of multiple genes rather than single, use of inducible promoters instead of constitutive ones have been shown to give superior performance of transgenic plants. Further improvement in above strategies are however still necessary because all the above approaches have <b>only</b> resulted in <b>varying</b> <b>degree</b> of resistance, not complete fungus tolerance. ...|$|R

The aim of this genealogy and its narrative counterparts is to re-imagine {{the ways in which}} public spaces in the urban environment can be understood with reference to their materiality and use or non- use. This re-imagining aims to move away from all subjective accounts that focus <b>only</b> on <b>varying</b> <b>degrees</b> of use and the use-value of materiality and can lend themselves all to easily to ideals and aspirations of city planners and various scripted political projects. The thesis argues that of key importance in this re-imagining is to give space a clear role to play in its own apprehension. The argument of the thesis is that in order to apprehend public spaces in terms of their own materiality at one with use, a detailing of their materiality and use or non-use is insufficient if set up in juxtaposition to each other or made to interact through a dialectical confrontation. The thesis maintains that a strong empirical focus on the relations between materiality and use or non-use, on the most general level, will yield the most productive way of apprehending public spaces in terms of not reducing interactions between its materiality and use or non-use to a scripted theatre of determined functions and their subversion...|$|R

There is no clear evidence base as to the glycaemic level at which to intervene and the significance of the intervention on outcomes. Methods We prospectively reviewed the treatment of 229 patients admitted to a stroke unit and compared admission blood glucose results with stroke prognostic/neurological deficit score (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) at 30 days. Inter-physician practice variability allowed us to observe the outcomes when different levels for intervention were used (and allowed us to calculate an optimum level of glucose at which insulin sliding scale treatment would lead to most benefit).

Our data, the Indonesian Family Life Survey is no different. Recognizing {{the lack of a}} credible instrument, we instead pursue a different strategy based on the methodology of Altonji et al. (JPE, 2005). This method assesses the robustness of the impact of child work estimated under the assumption of random selection (i. e., selection into child work on observable attributes <b>only)</b> to <b>varying</b> <b>degrees</b> of non-random selection (i. e., selection into child labor on unobservable attributes). If the estimated effect is found to be extremely sensitive to selection on unobservables, then one should be wary about inferring an adverse causal effect of child work. In addition, the nature of the selection process is identified using parametric assumptions. The results are striking, suggesting positive selection of children into work when we consider underweight and high weight status as dependent variables. This indicates that there is both healthy worker selection effect as well as unhealthy worker selection effect. There is however negative selection into work for the children belonging to the intermediate weight range. This heterogeneity in the selection process across the distribution has not been previously identified in the literature. Moreover, we also find evidence suggesting a heterogeneous impact of child work on health once we allow for a modest amount of selection on unobservables. Specifically, we find evidence of a negative causal effect of work on healthier children, but evidence of beneficial impact of work on the least healthy children.
