40|$|Most of the {{existing}} displays and <b>optical</b> <b>shutters</b> based on liquid crystals work in combination with linear polarizers. This implies that often {{more than half of}} the light is lost due to optical loss in the polarizers and/or the fact that the incoming light is unpolarized. For a number of shutter and filter applications it is important to have a high transmission, while it is not necessary to have a very high contrast. When considering nematic liquid crystals for use in fast <b>optical</b> <b>shutters</b> or filters, a number of possibilities exist. Dual-frequency liquid crystals offer faster switching possibilities because they can be switched from one state to another with a low frequency voltage and switching back can be achieved with the aid of a high frequency voltage. One of the limiting factors for the switching speed of dual-frequency nematics is the appearance of backflow. As in vertically aligned nematic devices, a certain threshold voltage exists above which the switching speed increases drastically [1]. Above the backflow threshold, the liquid crystal ends up in a meta-stable twisted orientation as shown in the figure below...|$|R

40|$|Infrared (IR) cameras {{based on}} microbolometer focal plane arrays (FPAs) {{are the most}} widely used cameras in thermography. New fields of {{applications}} like handheld devices and small distributed sensors benefit from the latest sensor improvements in terms of cost and size reduction. In order to compensate for disturbing influences derived from changing ambient conditions, radiometric cameras use an <b>optical</b> <b>shutter</b> for online recalibration purposes, partially also together with sensor temperature stabilization. For these new applications, IR cameras should consist only of infrared optics, a sensor array, and digital signal processing (DSP). For acceptable measurement uncertainty values without using an <b>optical</b> <b>shutter</b> (shutter-less), the disturbing influences of changing thermal conditions have to be treated based on temperature measurements of the camera interior. We propose a compensation approach based on calibration measurements under controlled ambient conditions. All correction parameters are determined during the calibration process. Without sensor temperature stabilization (TEC-less), the pixel responsivity is also affected by the camera temperature changes and has to be considered separately.
