40|$|To {{determine}} whether rearing density affects the hypermelanosis on the blind side (ambicoloration) of <b>olive</b> <b>flounders</b> Paralichthys olivaceus, we reared fry with an unpigmented non-eyed (blind) side in duplicate at densities of 150 individuals/m 2 (commercial production density: control) and 450 individuals/m 2 (high density group) for 90 days in 1 -t dark-green fiberglass reinforced plastics (FRP) tank. We recorded feed intake, {{feed conversion efficiency}} (FE), growth and survival, and measured the ratios of staining blind-side area (staining area) and ambicolored fish every 30 days. Daily feed intake (DFI), feed conversion efficiency (FE), growth rate, condition factors, and survival rate were calculated {{at the end of}} the experiment. Although the FE was higher in the high-density compared to the control, the two density groups showed similar feed intakes, growth, and survival. The ratio of staining area as well as the ratio of ambicolored fish significantly were significantly higher in the high-density group than in the control from days 30 to 60, but significantly increased and evened out by the end of the experiment (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, we determined that rearing density is not the main cause of the blind-side hypermelanosis, but found that increasing the rearing density can accelerate the ambicoloration in <b>olive</b> <b>flounders...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{exportation}} of cultured <b>olive</b> <b>flounder</b> (Paralichthys olivaceus) in Korea {{has been}} recently decreasing {{due to the}} infections with a myxozoan parasite Kudoa septempunctata, {{and there is a}} strong demand for strict food safety management because the food poisoning associated with consumption of raw <b>olive</b> <b>flounder</b> harbouring K. septempunctata has been frequently reported in Japan. The life cycle and infection dynamics of K. septempunctata in aquatic environment are currently unknown, which hamper establishment of effective control methods. We investigated sea water and marine invertebrates collected from <b>olive</b> <b>flounder</b> farms for detecting K. septempunctata by DNA-based analysis, to elucidate infection dynamics of K. septempunctata in aquaculture farms. In addition, live marine polychaetes were collected and maintained in well plates to find any possible actinosporean state of K. septempunctata. The level of K. septempunctata DNA in rearing water fluctuated during the sampling period but the DNA was not detected in summer (June–July in farm A and August in farm B). K. septempunctata DNA was also detected in the polychaetes Naineris laevigata intestinal samples, showing decreased pattern of 40 to 0 %. No actinosporean stage of K. septempunctata was observed in the polychaetes by microscopy. The absence of K. septempunctata DNA in rearing water of fish farm and the polychaetes N. laevigata intestinal samples during late spring and early summer indicate that the infection may not occur during this period. N. laevigata was suspected as the possible alternate invertebrate host of K. septempunctata, but the actinosporean stage was not found by well plate method and further studies will be necessary. This research provides important baseline information for understanding the infection dynamics of K. septempunctata in <b>olive</b> <b>flounder</b> farms and further establishment of control strategies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this study, {{to clarify}} the {{function}} of PoPLC-β 1, in response to stress challenge, we examined the PoPLC-β 1 expression pattern in response to external stress (pathogen-associated molecular pathogen challenge and environmental challenge including temperature and salinity). PoPLC-β 1 expression analysis of tissue from <b>olive</b> <b>flounder</b> showed that the messenger RNA (mRNA) was predominantly expressed in the brain, heart, eye, liver, spleen, and stomach. We also tested the mRNA expression of the PoPLC-β 1 in the spleen and kidney of <b>olive</b> <b>flounder</b> by RT-PCR and real-time PCR following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), concanavalin A (ConA), or polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C) and compared with the inflammatory cytokines IL- 1 b and IL- 6 in the stimulated flounder tissues. Each of the spleen and kidney and mRNA transcripts of PoPLC-β 1 were increased 30 - and 10 -fold than normal tissue at 1 – 6  h post injection (HPI) with PolyI:C when the expression of PoPLC-β 1 transcript was similar to LPS and ConA.

Photoperiod was treated natural photoperiod and long photoperiod (15 L: 9 D) conditions from September 2011 to March 2012. The results showed that natural photoperiodic group showed a higher gonadosomatic index (GSI) than long photoperiodic group during the spawning season (March 2012). The histological analysis of ovarian tissue showed that natural photoperiod group of ovaries contained vitellogenic oocytes, but long photoperiod group of ovaries mainly contained perinucleolus staged oocyte and oil-drop staged oocytes. The FSH mRNA of <b>olive</b> <b>flounder,</b> under natural photoperiod group, showed a significantly higher expression but no significant difference under long photoperiod group.
