50|$|The {{aircraft}} possessed {{an exceptionally}} clean finish, being of wooden construction with plywood- and fabric-covered wings and a plywood-covered fuselage. These features enabled the Baladin {{to attain a}} maximum speed of 158 mph on a 90 h.p. engine. A one-piece all-moving tailplane is employed, and {{a feature of the}} design is the large wingtip endplate which slides rearward for access to the fuel <b>filler</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|R
50|$|The T 3s had a {{wet steam}} engine with two {{cylinders}} {{that drove the}} centre coupled axle. The slide valves were worked by an outside Allan valve gear. The water supply was stored in a well tank between the frame under the boiler; the coal bunkers were {{on the left and}} right hand side of the firebox. In front of each one was a <b>filler</b> <b>pipe</b> for the water tank.|$|R
50|$|The engine used {{clockwise}} rotation as a standard, but some counter-clockwise engines were produced. While {{they were a}} very sturdy, reliable engine, they did have a few flaws, {{one of which was}} that the water tap poured water over the <b>oil</b> <b>filler.</b> This was easily corrected by the use of a rubber pipe.|$|R

50|$|In a {{wet sump}} system, the main {{dipstick}} reaches to {{near the bottom}} of the crankcase. The <b>oil</b> <b>filler</b> cap covers a hole in the crankcase where oil can be added; it is typically located on the top of the rocker cover (or if two, the one closer to the front of the vehicle).|$|R
50|$|The {{fuel filter}} {{moved from the}} wing {{to the top of}} the {{thermostat}} housing. The <b>oil</b> <b>filler</b> moved from the crankcase cover to the dipstick housing. The front indicators were originally combined with the headlights, but later replaced by side lights (moved from the headlight reflector) and separate indicators were fitted in the bumper.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a fuel <b>filler</b> <b>pipe</b> is based solely on experience and physical experiment. The challenge lies in designing the pipe to fulfill the customer needs. In other words designing the pipe such as the fuel flow does not splash back on the fuel dispenser causing a premature shut off. To improve this “trial-and-error” based development a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the refueling process is investigated. In this thesis a CFD model has been developed that can predict the fuel flow in the <b>filler</b> <b>pipe.</b> Worst case scenario of the refueling process is during the first second when the tank is partially filled. The most critical fluid is diesel due to the commercially high volume flow of 55 l/min. Due to limitations of computational resources the simulations {{are focused on the}} first second of the refueling process. The challenge in this project is creating a CFD model that is time efficient, thus require the least amount of computational resources necessary to provide useful information. A multiphase model is required to simulate the refueling process. In this project the implicit volume of fluid (VOF) has been used which has previously proven to be a suitable choice for refueling simulations. The project is divided into two parts. Part one starts with experiments and simulations of a simplified fuel system with water as acting liquid with a Reynolds number of 90 000. A short comparison between three different turbulence models has been investigated (LES, DES and URANS) where the most promising turbulence model is URANS, specifically the SST k-ω model. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the chosen turbulence model. Between the chosen mesh and the densest mesh the difference of streamwise velocity in the boundary layer was 2. 6 %. The chosen mesh with 1. 9 M cells and a time step of 1 e- 4 s was found to be the best correlating model with respect to the experiments. In part two a real fuel filling system was investigated both with experiments and simulations with the same computational model as the chosen one from part one. The change of fluid and geometry resulted in a lower Reynolds number of 12 000. Two different versions of the fuel system was investigated; with a bypass pipe and without a bypass pipe. Because of a larger volumetric region the resulting mesh had 3. 7 M cells. The finished model takes about 230 h on a local workstation with 11 cores. On a cluster with 200 cores the same simulation takes 30 h. The resulting model suffered from interpolation errors at the inlet which resulted in a volume flow of 50 l/min as opposed to 55 l/min in the experiments. Despite the difference the model could capture the key flow characteristics. With the developed model a new <b>filler</b> <b>pipe</b> can be easily implemented and provide results in shorter time than a prototype <b>filler</b> <b>pipe</b> can be ordered. This will increase the chances of ordering one single prototype that fulfills all requirements. While the simulation model cannot completely replace verification by experiments it provides information that transforms the {{development of}} the <b>filler</b> <b>pipe</b> to knowledge based development...|$|R
5000|$|... A {{mechanical}} seal {{would most likely}} be created out of an annular elastomeric material through which the nozzle must pass during refueling, preventing vapors from escaping alongside the nozzle. A liquid seal is created by {{the design of the}} <b>filler</b> <b>pipe,</b> which creates a seal with the liquid flowing into the tank. Since the liquid fills the entire pipe, no emissions can escape during refueling. A liquid seal is usually used for smaller vehicles, while the {{mechanical seal}} is used for larger vehicles.|$|R
25|$|In Europe and Australia, the {{customer}} selects {{one of several}} color-coded nozzles {{depending on the type}} of fuel required. The <b>filler</b> <b>pipe</b> of unleaded fuel is smaller than the one for fuels for engines designed to take leaded fuel. The tank filler opening has a corresponding diameter; this prevents inadvertently using leaded fuel in an engine not designed for it, which can damage a catalytic converter. In European Union countries leaded fuel is no longer available, with LRP (lead replacement petrol) being the only fuel available for engines which need it.|$|R
50|$|The <b>oil</b> <b>filler</b> tube for {{the engine}} is located behind the flip-down license plate door, as is the oil {{dipstick}} and the power steering fluid reservoir (when fitted). Most vans had a twist-on/off gas cap right on the outside just under and behind the passenger side door. A locking cap was optional. The spare tyre lies in a tray under the very front of the van (as {{the engine is}} in the back), just below the radiator.|$|R
2500|$|Leyland's {{corporate}} badge, {{a design}} {{based on the}} spokes of a wheel, appeared on the hubcaps of the 1500FWD, and next to the Triumph name on the metal identification labels fitted to the bootlids of various models. It was also used for the <b>oil</b> <b>filler</b> cap on the Dolomite Sprint engine. However it was never used as a bonnet badge, with models of that era such as the TR6 and the second generation 2000 carrying a badge simply stating the name [...] "Triumph".|$|R
50|$|The dynamo {{is driven}} from the clutch casing {{so it is}} {{generating}} while the engine is running. The nearside of the engine carries the generator and magneto, the carburettor and its water-heated induction pipe with a proper hot-spot and the vacuum tank on the dash.The offside of the engine has the starter, steering-box, exhaust manifold, oil-dipper gauge and <b>oil</b> <b>filler.</b> The water connection between the lower casting and the cylinder head is through large external aluminium ports {{so there is a}} single compression joint between castings.|$|R
50|$|Tell-tale {{signs of}} such {{eventual}} related damage are a white foam that {{appears on the}} inside of the <b>oil</b> <b>filler</b> cap and the gradually increasing loss of antifreeze coolant (due to seepage into the intake passages which will lead to engine lock up failure in such cases). External seepage is also found near the valley edge of the lower intake manifold. These engines are also known for problematic EGR Valves in which carbon build-up occurs very rapidly, therefore reducing gas mileage drastically, however without affecting the reliability of the engine.|$|R
5000|$|The Times {{tried the}} 14/28 again and {{reported}} to its readers in mid January 1926 {{that while there}} may now be better designs of light car the 14/28 represented great value for money and still came with insurance for its first twelve months. A petrol gauge on the dash and an [...] "automatic screen wiper", two horns and a proper rear windscreen. There was still no filter in the <b>oil</b> <b>filler.</b> The same complaints were made as in previous reports yet the car's general behaviour on the road was considered [...] "praiseworthy".|$|R
50|$|Road debris {{can also}} cause other more {{specific}} problems and damage to vehicles. Rocks striking the catalytic converter can cause the internal mat to break and clog the converter. Several recalls have occurred due to road debris. The 2005 Scion TC's wind deflector was recalled because of potential shatter from road debris impact. The 2004 Mitsubishi Endeavor was recalled in February 2010 when {{it was determined that}} a mixture of road salt and road debris (mud) might be trapped between a reinforcing bracket and the fuel <b>filler</b> <b>pipe,</b> causing corrosion. The 2001 Chevrolet C/K chassis cab truck was also recalled on discovery that road debris could strike and damage its pressure relief valves.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{different}} types of fuel have specially sized of nozzles to prevent accidentally filling a tank with an incompatible fuel. The nozzle on diesel pumps {{is supposed to be}} larger so that it cannot fit into the <b>filler</b> <b>pipe</b> on a vehicle tank designed for gasoline. However, the larger diameter diesel nozzles are not an actual requirement, and many diesel pumps at auto islands have been fitted with standard gasoline nozzles. Also, the nozzle for leaded gasoline is wider than for unleaded, and the fill pipe on vehicles designed for unleaded-only was made narrower to prevent [...] "mis-fueling". Some diesel fuel tanks are designed to prevent wrong type of nozzle to be used.|$|R
40|$|Premature {{shut-off}} (PSO) of {{the fuel}} dispenser nozzle during automotive fuel tank refuelling {{is considered to be}} a nuisance. PSO occurs when the nozzle stops before the automotive fuel tank is completely full. The physics involved in the PSO process is complex and poses a significant challenge in the design of an automotive fuel tank system. A preliminary study is presented which indicates that a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) solution {{of the fuel}} tank filling process for a complete three-dimensional geometry is impractical due to excessive computational time. A hybrid modeling method is investigated to address this problem. In the hybrid model, the fuel tank system is divided into a number of subsystems each with its own specific model. A lumped parameter model is developed to simulate the storage tank and vent tubes while a three-dimensional CFD model is employed to simulate the complex multiphase flow in the <b>filler</b> <b>pipe.</b> The lumped parameter model accounts for vapour generation in the tank. The 3 -D multiphase flow model is coupled with the lumped parameter model through the User Defined Function in a CFD program, FLUENT. The model is also modified to consider the effect of tank expansion and that of the variation of tank shape. It is found that the experimental results of multiphase flow in the <b>filler</b> <b>pipe</b> and the tank dome pressure are well predicted through the CFD simulation using the hybrid modeling method. The tank expansion during the period of fuel filling does not significantly affect the flow field. The variation in tank shape, however, can have a significant influence on the flow field. It is also found that a 72. 0...|$|R

50|$|The {{tank was}} carried via two {{transport}} belts and padded back. It {{was composed of}} two cylinders. Each was divided internally into two parts by a metal diaphragm. The two upper sections were linked together and could hold 6 litres of nitrogen at 20 atmospheres, which acted as a propellant. The lower halves were also connected and contained 12 litres of fuel, a mixture composed of 9 parts diesel oil and 1 part gasoline. Both substances were loaded from special openings on {{the upper end of}} the cylinders, where a manual valve conveyed the liquid nitrogen in the tank to pressurize them at the moment of use. The <b>filler</b> <b>pipe</b> coupling of the lance was located in the lower part of the tank, beside the right cylinder.|$|R
50|$|The DV {{range was}} {{available}} in range of sizes with capacities ranging from 8 to 36 pints, {{and the number of}} feeds from 1 to 26. Each of the lubricators consist of a reservoir, a ratchet assembly, a sliding shaft assembly, and the pump units. A screwed <b>oil</b> <b>filler</b> cap is fitted to the lockable hinged lid of the reservoir and a sight glass for indicating the oil level is fitted to the front face of the reservoir. The pumps of the DV type lubricator are operated by a sliding shaft assembly, unlike the Silverton or Wakefield lubricators which are operated by a rotating camshaft.|$|R
50|$|Thin sheet metals {{are often}} flanged to produce edge-flange or corner-flange welds. These welds are {{typically}} made without {{the addition of}} filler metal because the flange melts and provides all the <b>filler</b> needed. <b>Pipes</b> and tubing {{can be made from}} rolling and welding together strips, sheets, or plates of material.|$|R
50|$|Some of the 096 {{parts were}} held {{over for the}} 01M transmission, such as oil filter, <b>oil</b> pan, <b>filler</b> tube, gaskets, {{speedometer}} gears, skid plate, etc. These transmissions have different torque converters and other internal parts that are not interchangeable.|$|R
50|$|Just past Siena, Marzotto {{remembered that}} the Ferrari {{mechanics}} did not change his engine oil at the last control point, as {{they were unable to}} open the bonnet. After making a U-turn, he raced back to Siena, where his mechanics cut a hole in the bonnet, directly over the engines <b>oil</b> <b>filler</b> cap, and topped the oil up accordingly. Meanwhile, Juan Manuel Fangio’s Alfa was now leading, but surrender to the chasing Marzotto when his steering started to play up along with fading brakes. Although Marzotto suffered two minor crashes, he took {{it all the way to}} Brescia, to win his second Mille Miglia, repeating his success of 1950, again accompanied by Crosara.|$|R
50|$|On Saturday 22 March 2008, Abbott had a {{spectacular}} 100+mph crash in the Rob Austin Racing Ginetta G50 {{in the opening}} round of the 2008 British GT Championship at Oulton Park. After being tagged by Peter Snowdon's Aston Martin Abbott struck the barriers {{on the outside of}} the circuit between Old Hall and Cascades corners at unabated speed. The car flipped several times end over end, clearing the safety barriers, before coming to rest upside down where it burst into flames. The fire was caused by the roof skin being ripped off in the force of the accident, in the process this also ripped off the fuel <b>filler</b> <b>pipes</b> from the fuel tank. As it was near the beginning of the race the fuel tank was near full, when the car came to rest upside down the fuel load leaked quickly into the car.|$|R

50|$|In 1967 Ducati's {{successful}} 350 scrambler motor {{was selected}} {{for use in the}} new Swiss military motorcycle. At first plans were to just import the engine block but later plans were changed to import the whole engine, although there was some Swiss tinkering. The exhaust port and assembly was made more robust. The steel exhaust pipe and muffler were built to run almost silently and the whole assembly is sprayed with aluminum. The <b>oil</b> <b>filler</b> cap changed to a longer tube to make filling easier. Compression was reduced to 8.2:1 so that the bike could run on poor quality gas. The result is a reliable engine that made only 16.6 hp, and it will do about 70 miles per hour. The oil filter was mounted remotely.|$|R

For most of the return leg, his Alfa had effective steering on one front wheel.|$|R
50|$|The first {{refinement}} in {{crankcase ventilation}} was the road draft tube, {{which is a}} pipe running from a high location contiguous to the crankcase (such as {{the side of the}} engine block, or the valve cover on an overhead valve engine) down to an open end facing down and located in the vehicle's slipstream. When the vehicle is moving, airflow across the open end of the tube creates a draft that pulls gases out of the crankcase. The high location of the engine end of the pipe minimises liquid oil loss. An air inlet path to the crankcase, called the breather and often incorporated into the <b>oil</b> <b>filler</b> cap, meant that when a draft was generated at the tube, fresh air swept through the crankcase to clear out the blow-by gases.|$|R
50|$|The {{condition}} {{of a head}} gasket is typically investigated by checking the compression pressure with a pressure gauge, or better, a leak-down test, and/or noting any indication of combustion gases in the cooling system on a water-cooled engine. Oil mixed with coolant and excessive coolant loss with no apparent cause, or presence of carbon monoxide or hydrocarbon gases in the expansion tank of the cooling system can also be signs of head gasket problems. A good sign of head gasket failure on water-cooled engines {{is the presence of}} a substance that resembles mayonnaise in the oil, often to be seen on the dipstick, or <b>oil</b> <b>filler</b> cap. However, the presence of this substance is not conclusive proof of head gasket failure, since oil could mix with the coolant via other routes.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the power}} and torque increases, the 2.4-litre cars also got a newer, {{stronger}} transmission, identified by its Porsche type number 915. Derived from the transmission in the Porsche 908 race car, the 915 did away with the 901 transmission's [...] "dog-leg" [...] style first gear arrangement, opting for a traditional H pattern with first gear up to the left, second gear underneath first, etc. The E series had the unusual <b>oil</b> <b>filler</b> behind the right side door, with the dry sump oil tank relocated from behind the right rear wheel {{to the front of}} it in an attempt to move the center of gravity slightly forward for better handling. An extra oil filler/inspection flap was located on the rear wing, for this reason it became known as an [...] "Oil Klapper", [...] "Ölklappe" [...] or [...] "Vierte Tür (4th door)".|$|R
5|$|The {{first batch}} of twenty {{locomotives}} was ordered in April 1941, although {{the changes in}} design to the Light Pacific arrangement meant that production was delayed until late 1944. Due to wartime contract work at Brighton works, the boilers were built under contract at the North British Locomotive Company. Before {{the first of the}} class had been delivered, the order was increased to thirty, with a second batch of ten ordered in September 1944. Deliveries from Brighton works began in May 1945 with prototype No. 21C101 Exeter, and proceeded at the rate of about two locomotives per month. The class was gradually run in on the Central Section until October 1945, when they were successfully trialled on Plymouth and Kentish services. By the time the first fifteen had entered traffic a further order of fifteen was placed, with these entering service between June and October 1946. From this batch onwards, traction was improved by the addition of steam sanding to the front driving wheel, with covers added to protect the motion from sand falling from the <b>filler</b> <b>pipes.</b>|$|R
