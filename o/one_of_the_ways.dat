5|$|Leg before wicket (lbw) is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> {{in which}} a batsman can be {{dismissed}} in the sport of cricket. Following an appeal by the fielding side, the umpire may rule a batsman out lbw if the ball would have struck the wicket, but was instead intercepted by {{any part of the}} batsman's body (except the hand holding the bat). The umpire's decision will depend on a number of criteria, including where the ball pitched, whether the ball hit in line with the wickets, and whether the batsman was attempting to hit the ball.|$|E

25|$|Epistasis {{occurs when}} the {{expression}} of one gene is modified by another gene. For example, gene A only shows its effect when allele B1 (at another Locus) is present, but not if it is absent. This is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> in which two or more genes may combine to produce a coordinated change {{in more than one}} characteristic (for instance, in mimicry).

25|$|Another {{technique}} for overcoming the memory-size problem is using external sorting, for example <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> is to combine two algorithms {{in a way}} that takes advantage of the strength of each to improve overall performance. For instance, the array might be subdivided into chunks of a size that will fit in RAM, the contents of each chunk sorted using an efficient algorithm (such as quicksort), and the results merged using a k-way merge similar to that used in mergesort. This is faster than performing either mergesort or quicksort over the entire list.|$|E

Apart from members of the Dacian elite and those who wished to attain improved social and economic positions, who largely adopted Roman names and manners, the majority of native Dacians retained their names and their cultural distinctiveness even with the increasing embrace of Roman cultural norms which followed their incorporation into the Roman empire.|$|E
