5|$|The Caliph {{took over}} {{preparations}} for a retaliatory expedition himself, as the campaigns against Byzantium were customarily the only <b>ones</b> <b>where</b> caliphs participated in person. Al-Mu'tasim assembled a huge force—80,000 men with 30,000 servants and camp followers according to Michael the Syrian, or even bigger according to other writers—at Tarsus, and declared his target to be Amorium, {{the birthplace of}} the reigning Byzantine dynasty. The Caliph reportedly had the name painted on the shields and banners of his army. The campaign began in June, with a smaller force under al-Afshin attacking through the Pass of Hadath in the east, while the Caliph with the main army crossed the Cilician Gates on 19–21 June. Theophilos, who had been caught unaware by the two-pronged Abbasid attack, tried to confront al-Afshin's smaller force first, but suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Dazimon on 22 July, barely escaping with his life. Unable to offer any effective resistance to the Abbasid advance, the emperor returned to Constantinople. A week later, al-Afshin and the main caliphal army joined forces before Ancyra, which had been left defenceless and was plundered.|$|E

25|$|This Western-oriented {{line would}} be the new vision of Erdoğan and the more open-minded members of the Erbakan movement, such as Abdullah Gül. In their vision, authoritarian secularism in Turkey should not be {{considered}} an extension of the West, as religious conservatives had done for decades. The West should rather be seen as a way to create a more liberal Turkey that would respect religious liberty as well. Erdoğan had personal reasons to make that choice: He could thus send his veiled daughters, Esra and Sümeyye, not to Turkish universities, where there is a headscarf ban, but to American <b>ones,</b> <b>where</b> the coverings can be worn.|$|E
25|$|The 2003–2005 Under Grand Hotel, {{set in a}} men's prison, {{has been}} praised for showing a more {{realistic}} depiction of rape. Authors such as Fusanosuke Inariya (of Maiden Rose fame) utilize rape not as the traditional romantic catalyst, but as a tragic dramatic plot element, rendering her stories a subversion of contemporary tropes that reinforce and reflect older tropes such as the prevalence of romantic tragedy themes. Other yaoi tend to depict a relationship that begins as non-consensual and evolves into a consensual relationship. However, Fusanosuke's stories are <b>ones</b> <b>where</b> the characters' relationship begins as consensual and devolves into non-consensual, often due to external societal pressures that label the character's gay relationship as deviant. Her stories are still characterized by fantasy, yet they do brutally and realistically illustrate scenes of sexual assault between characters.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the years, Enríquez {{remained}} mostly {{focused in}} his role as a merchant, exploiting this distinction to move legal and smuggled products with success. He could easily use his privateering ships to launder goods that were otherwise illegal, investing the saving in land and properties. On occasion, he even received permission to openly import illegal merchandise. He used these exceptions to compensate for materials that were lacking in Puerto Rico. His enemies tried to expose him, but with little success. In 1718, they testified that Enríquez had smuggled clothes and other items hidden aboard the sloop La Gloria. Led by Pozo, the group launched another defamatory campaign against him. The attorney of San Juan even blamed him for a shortage of food, after he attempted to export 700 units of merchandise citing that the market was oversaturated. Due to this action the food was retained at port and spoiled. As a consequence, Enríquez deduced that for the well-being of his business, the best was to move and sell the merchandise as far away as possible. His sloops were sent in long voyages, with the incursions of La Aurora and El Aguila lasting periods of nearly two years and nine months respectively. They operated and moved merchandise between Habana, Santiago and Cartagena. These ships were in fact buying and selling contraband by veiling it as products captured by privateering. Upon returning to San Juan, both of these vessels arrived without any privateering spoils. Despite this, Enríquez gathered so much merchandise that it was unrivaled in Puerto Rico, selling anything that covered basic necessities of the citizens, ranging from food to brushes, razors, leather, locks and clothes. They also offered other commodities, such as playing cards, wines imported from Spain and equipment required for horse riding. Enríquez managed four warehouses, which besides storing merchandise were also used to manufacture anything that his ships needed. He divided them by class, separating the <b>ones</b> <b>where</b> food was stored from the <b>ones</b> <b>where</b> backup equipment was kept.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, the {{original}} doctrine of Jainism was contained in scriptures called Purva. There were fourteen Purva. These {{are believed to}} have originated from Rishabhanatha, the first tirthankara. There was a twelve-year famine around fourth century BCE. At that time, Chandragupta Maurya was the ruler of Magadha and Bhadrabahu was the head of Jain community. Bhadrabahu went south to Karnataka with his adherents and Sthulabhadra, another Jain leader remained behind. During this time the knowledge of the doctrine was getting lost. A council was formed at Pataliputra where eleven scriptures called Angas were compiled and the remnant of fourteen purvas were written down in 12th Anga, Ditthivaya by the adherents of Sthulbhadra. When followers of Bhadrabahu returned, there was a dispute between them regarding the authenticity of the Angas. Also, those who stayed at Magadha started wearing white clothes which was unacceptable to the other who remain naked. This is how the Digambara and Svetambara sect came about. The Digambara being the naked <b>ones</b> <b>where</b> as Svetambara being the white clothed. According to Digambara, the purvas and the angas were lost. In course of time, the cannons of svetambara were also getting lost. About 980 to 993 years after the Nirvana of Mahavira, a Vallabhi council was held at Vallabhi (now in Gujarat). This was headed by Devardhi Ksamashramana. It was found that the 12th Anga, the Ditthivaya, was lost too. The other Angas were written down. This is a traditional account of schism. According to Svetambara, there were eight schisms (Nihvana).|$|E
25|$|Serbia {{inherited}} about a {{third of}} the diplomatic facilities that belonged to the former Yugoslavia. After 2001 embassies in Chile, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Guinea, Lebanon, Mongolia, North Korea, Pakistan, Thailand, Venezuela, Vietnam and Zimbabwe were closed due to financial or reciprocal reasons. In June 2008 the Government of Serbia made a decision to close consulates in Bari, Graz and Malmö, and later that year Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremić announced a plan to open a consulate-general in Knin (Croatia) during the autumn and an embassy in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia). Foreign Minister also announced that some diplomatic missions might be closed but also announced a plan for opening missions in Kazakhstan, Los Angeles, Pakistan, UAE and Venezuela. Construction of the new embassy in Washington and reconstruction of the existing buildings in Paris, Nairobi and Brussels is also planned. In late 2008 it was announced that due to the economic crisis expansion plans will be reviewed. In January 2009, the Government of Serbia announced opening of diplomatic trade offices. Many of them will be opened in different cities to the <b>ones</b> <b>where</b> embassies are located as they will be opened in largest economic centres. These offices will be opened in Russia, Germany, Italy, France, Austria, United Kingdom, Greece, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Republic of Macedonia, China, USA, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Switzerland, Turkey, India and South Korea. Government also announced the opening of police liaison offices for a better cooperation with foreign law enforcement agencies. In April 2009, Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that consulate from Rijeka wil be moved to Knin in Croatia. In May 2009 it was announced that the embassy in Peru will be temporarily closed and that the consulate-general in Lyon will be closed while the embassy in Kenya was reopened. Due to the legal succession of the Yugoslav properties abroad, Serbia will have to hand over embassy buildings in Vienna, The Hague and Lisbon (to Croatia), Canberra (to the Republic of Macedonia), Ankara, Madrid, Oslo and Ottawa (to Bosnia and Herzegovina) as well as consulate buildings in Klagenfurt, Milan (to Slovenia), Toronto (to Croatia), Zurich and Athens (to the Republic of Macedonia). Serbia will hand over the embassy building in Rome to Slovenia in 2011. In November 2010, the Government of Serbia made a decision to open embassies in Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Qatar and reopen embassies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ghana in 2011 and announced a plan to open embassies in Oman, Chile, Venezuela and Pakistan in the future. In March 2011, Serbia opened its embassy in Azerbaijan and Consulate-General in Herceg Novi. In June 2011, Serbia opened its embassy in Kazakhstan.|$|E

50|$|Structural {{engineers}} have several principal categories of bridge decks, {{for the purposes}} of analytic techniques.

The supporting system of a grid deck is analyzed using a grillage analysis. A slab deck is <b>one</b> <b>where</b> the deck is analyzed as a plate. If the slab has a stiffness that is different in two directions (at right angles), then the deck is known and analyzed as an orthotropic deck. A beam and slab deck is <b>one</b> <b>where</b> the beams may deflect somewhat independently, and any transverse forces are carried in the deck. A cellular deck is <b>one</b> <b>where</b> a number of thin slabs and webs will enclose cells within the deck. A boxgirder deck is <b>one</b> <b>where</b> the deck forms the top of the box girder during analysis.|$|R
