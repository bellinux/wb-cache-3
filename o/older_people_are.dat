A total of 926 references to <b>older</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> sampled from 62 {{articles published in}} four Taiwanese newspapers from January to August 2013. The findings suggest that, <b>older</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> frequently allocated roles suggestive of dependency.

People of very advanced ages, meanwhile, were often discussed in the contexts of problems or tragedies. On the whole, negative stereotypes of <b>older</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> dominant within the sample, and appeared to be treated as more newsworthy. The articles occasionally reported positive experiences of aging, but implied that, these were exceptional. The nature of older age and aging as discursively constructed in Taiwanese newspapers appears to be problematic for those seeking to build a less ageist society in Taiwan...|$|R

2500|$|An {{insurance}} underwriter's job is {{to evaluate}} a given risk as to {{the likelihood that a}} loss will occur. Any factor that causes a greater likelihood of loss should theoretically be charged a higher rate. This basic principle of insurance must be followed if insurance companies are to remain solvent. Thus, [...] "discrimination" [...] against (i.e., negative differential treatment of) potential insureds in the risk evaluation and premium-setting process is a necessary by-product of the fundamentals of insurance underwriting. For instance, insurers charge older people significantly higher premiums than they charge younger people for term life insurance. <b>Older</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> thus treated differently from younger people (i.e., a distinction is made, discrimination occurs). The rationale for the differential treatment {{goes to the heart of}} the risk a life insurer takes: Old people are likely to die sooner than young people, so the risk of loss (the insured's death) is greater in any given period of time and therefore the risk premium must be higher to cover the greater risk. However, treating insureds differently when there is no actuarially sound reason for doing so is unlawful discrimination.|$|E

We were so young that I think we both felt, beneath our very real and vivid emotions, a gratifying sense of romantic resourcefulness in this prolonged discussion.

40|$|The {{existing}} literature on social exclusion among <b>older</b> <b>people,</b> though relatively limited, suggests that disadvantage among <b>older</b> <b>people</b> <b>is</b> cumulative in nature. Some aspects of disadvantage starting at early life stages have long-term consequences. As such, <b>older</b> <b>people</b> with disadvantages {{may be subject}} to higher risks of persistent social exclusion. This article aims to improve understanding of social exclusion and its persistence among senior Australians in three ways. Firstly, the incidence of social exclusion among <b>older</b> <b>people</b> <b>is</b> analysed using selected indicators. Secondly, the study examines whether an older person experiencing social exclusion at one time is more likely to experience it again (persistence). Thirdly, it investigates what factors may <b>be</b> protecting <b>older</b> <b>people</b> from social exclusion. The analysis is conducted using the first eight waves of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey. The sample of <b>older</b> <b>people</b> <b>is</b> disaggregated into a younger group (55 - 64 years at wave 1) and an older group (65 + years). The article suggests that higher education and income, as well as better health conditions and previous employment experiences, are important protective factors from social exclusion for older Australians...|$|R
