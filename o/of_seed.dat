5|$|A Middle Devonian {{precursor}} to seed plants {{has been identified}} from Belgium, predating the earliest seed plants by about 20 million years. Runcaria, small and radially symmetrical, is an integumented megasporangium surrounded by a cupule. The megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above the multilobed integument. It is suspected that the extension was involved in anemophilous pollination. Runcaria sheds {{new light on the}} sequence of character acquisition leading to the seed, having all the qualities <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> plants except for a solid seed coat and a system to guide the pollen to the seed.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{protective}} {{measures have been}} implemented, including site access restrictions, the collection and cold-storage <b>of</b> <b>seed,</b> and the treatment of plants with phosphite. Phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed {{as studies have shown}} that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth. Direct injection of phosphite into the stem of each tree appears to lack this disadvantage, but is costly to administer and restricted to known plants.|$|E
5|$|A small {{proportion}} of follicles open and release their seed spontaneously, but most remain closed until stimulated to open by bushfire. Bushfire kills the maternal plant, which has neither thick bark nor lignotubers, but the subsequent shedding <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> allows the population to regenerate. Seed predation continues after its release: in one study, B.brownii seeds {{were placed on the}} ground in both burnt and unburnt sides; almost all were eaten by parrots within four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} of conserving B.brownii in its present disease-exposed locations, it is an especially suitable candidate for ex situ conservation measures, such as the cold-storage <b>of</b> <b>seed,</b> and the translocation of plants to disease-free locations. Seed of B.brownii has been collected by Western Australia's Threatened Flora Seed Centre, and placed in cold-storage both in Perth and at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank. This includes seed collected from populations that have since become extinct. In 2008, some of this seed was germinated, and seedlings were planted at a location near Albany. Genetic analysis of the seedlings revealed some genetic diversity that was not present in any extant population. The conservation of these seeds had thus preserved some of the species' genetic diversity that would otherwise have been lost through population extinction, providing a powerful example of the importance <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> banking to conservation efforts. A seed orchard was planted in 2007, and by 2010 this had yielded over 400 disease-free, healthy plants, some of which had grown {{more than three times the}} rate of those in the wild. A 2007 seedling flowered for the first time at Wakehurst Place in February 2011.|$|E

40|$|<b>Seeds</b> <b>of</b> Eugenia pyriformis {{may produce}} several {{seedlings}} after cutting. Both {{the type of}} cutting and the size <b>of</b> the <b>seed</b> can determine the success in obtaining new seedlings. The size <b>of</b> the <b>seeds</b> is dependent on both the number <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> per fruit and {{the conditions in which}} seeds develop, as well as the biometric characteristics <b>of</b> these <b>seeds</b> obtained from different regions and seasons. The seeds from each origin were evaluated in length, width, thickness, water content and dry mass, as well as the average number <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> per fruit. From one <b>of</b> the regions, <b>seeds</b> were grouped according to the number <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> per fruit and also according to their size, and then cut into two and four parts, and then analyzed for the fragments germination. The results demonstrated the high capacity <b>of</b> these <b>seed</b> fragments to produce new seedlings, but the capability reduces with the reduction in seed size.

5|$|Crop {{diversity}} loss threatens global food security, as the world's {{human population}} {{depends on a}} diminishing number of varieties of a diminishing number of crop species. Crops are increasingly grown in monoculture, meaning that if, as in the historic Irish Potato Famine, a single disease overcomes a variety's resistance, it may destroy an entire harvest, or {{as in the case}} of the 'Gros Michel' banana, may cause the commercial extinction of an entire variety. With the help <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> banks, international organizations are working to preserve crop diversity.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} bird, in {{particular}} honeyeaters, forage at the flower spikes, as do native and European honeybees. The response to bushfire varies. Some populations are serotinous: they {{are killed by}} fire and regenerate from large stores <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> which have been held in cones in the plant canopy and are released after a fire. Others regenerate from underground lignotubers or suckers from lateral roots. Although {{it has been used}} for timber, Banksia marginata is most commonly seen as a garden plant, with dwarf forms being commercially propagated and sold.|$|E
40|$|A {{manually}} operated two-row okra planter was evaluated for performance by conducting field and laboratory tests.

5|$|Native mammals, such as {{the brown}} antechinus and sugar glider, are {{important}} pollinators of B. paludosa. Several species of honeyeaters visit the flower spikes, as do ants and the European honey bee.

B. paludosa is sometimes seen in cultivation, with dwarf forms being registered and sold.|$|E

5|$|B. coccinea {{is killed}} by fire and regenerates {{afterwards}} from seed released from burnt follicles. It has is {{some degree of}} serotiny, that is, it has an aerial seed bank in its canopy {{in the form of}} the follicles of the old flower spikes. However, numbers <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> are less than other co-occurring species of banksia on the southern plains and peak several years after a fire. Unusually for banksias, B. coccinea can release seed with resulting seedlings growing in the absence of a bushfire trigger. Plants flower and fruit three years after germination and are shorter-lived than other banksias, appearing in poor health or dying before 20 years of age. They hence appear to be suited to fire intervals of less than 20 years.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the British {{botanist}} E. J. H. Corner published The Durian Theory, or the Origin of the Modern Tree. His {{theory was}} that endozoochory (the enticement of animals to transport seeds in their stomach) arose before any other method <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> dispersal, and that primitive ancestors of Durio species were the earliest practitioners of that dispersal method, in particular red durian (D. dulcis) exemplifying the primitive fruit of flowering plants. However, in more recent circumscriptions of Durioneae, the tribe into which Durio and its sister taxa fall, fleshy arils and spiny fruits are derived within the clade. Some genera possess these characters, but others don't. The most recent molecular evidence (on which the most recent, well-supported circumscription of Durioneae is based) therefore refutes Corner's Durian Theory.|$|E
