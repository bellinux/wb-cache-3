50|$|A {{group of}} Chinese Buddhist missionaries led by Hui Shen before 500 CE {{claimed to have}} visited a {{location}} called Fusang. Although Chinese mapmakers placed this territory <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>coast,</b> others have suggested {{as early as the}} 1800s that Fusang might have been in North America, due to perceived similarities between portions of the California coast and Fusang as depicted by Asian sources.|$|R
50|$|In 1149, Corfu was retaken and George took a {{fleet of}} forty ships up the Bosphorus to the walls of Constantinople, where he tried to land. Failing this, he ravaged a few villae <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>coast</b> and fired arrows at the {{imperial}} palace. He died soon after, in year 546 AH according to Ibn al-Athir, corresponding to 1151 or 1152. He was succeeded in his offices by Philip of Mahdia.|$|R

5000|$|What {{followed}} {{the battle was}} a chain of events—of which the battle was the first link—that undermined the Empire {{in the years to}} come. They included intrigues for the throne, the fate of Romanos, and Roussel de Bailleul attempting to carve himself an independent kingdom in Galatia with his [...] Frankish, Norman, and German mercenaries. He defeated the Emperor's uncle John Doukas, who had come to suppress him, advancing toward the capital to destroy Chrysopolis (Üsküdar) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>coast</b> of <b>the</b> Bosphorus. The Empire finally turned to the spreading Seljuks to crush de Bailleul (which they did). However the Turks ransomed him back to his wife, and it was not before the young general Alexios Komnenos pursued him that he was captured. These events all interacted to create a vacuum that the Turks filled. Their choice in establishing their capital in Nikaea (Iznik) in 1077 could possibly be explained by a desire to see if the Empire's struggles could present new opportunities.|$|R
5|$|The {{ships were}} also {{active in the}} {{operations}} of the Greco-Turkish War in Asia Minor from 1919 to 1922. As the Greeks had been <b>on</b> <b>the</b> winning side in World War I and the Ottoman Empire was one of the defeated powers, the Greeks were awarded large areas of mixed Turkish and Greek populations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>coast</b> of <b>the</b> Aegean Sea. <b>On</b> 15 May 1919, 20,000 Greek soldiers landed in Smyrna and took control of the city and its surroundings under cover of the Greek, French, and British navies. Limnos was the flagship to the Second Fleet, based in Smyrna, under Rear Admiral G. Kalamidas; her mission was surveillance of the Black Sea, Dardanelles, and Asia Minor coasts. Over time, France and Italy became supportive of the emerging Turkish republic. Britain remained supportive of Greece, but opposed Greek moves against Istanbul in 1922. With waning support, the Greek army was defeated, and Greece was driven out of Asia by the Turks in late 1922, resulting in years of political and economic turmoil.|$|R
50|$|On 31 August 1915 Kitchener (British War Secretary) was {{informed}} that France was to land six divisions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>coast</b> of <b>the</b> Dardanelles. Joffre was probably involving the British to help block Sarrail’s plans. The entry of Bulgaria into <b>the</b> war <b>on</b> 6 September, threatening Serbia's rear, finally meant that Sarrail’s more ambitious plans had to be shelved. Joffre had already agreed (4 August) to a military mission going to Salonika, {{but it was not}} ready until 22 September, the day the Bulgarian Army mobilised. On 28 September Sarrail was told he was to command an expedition at Salonika, not in Turkey-in-Asia. The Greek government, pro-Allied but technically still neutral, went through the motions of formal diplomatic protest. Sarrail, asked by the War Minister for his views, recommended that the British be urged to maintain their presence at Gallipoli for reasons of Allied prestige. He urged that 30,000 British troops defend Salonika, whilst three or four French corps would push up towards the Bulgarian capital of Sofia. Joffre disapproved of much of this but was only in a position to obstruct, not to block.|$|R
5000|$|On 17 February 1915, a British {{seaplane}} from [...] flew a reconnaissance sortie {{over the}} Straits. Two days later, <b>the</b> first attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Dardanelles began when a strong Anglo-French task force, including the British battleship , began a long-range bombardment of Ottoman artillery along the coast. A period {{of bad weather}} slowed the initial phase but by 25 February the outer forts had been reduced and the entrance cleared of mines. Royal Marines were landed to destroy guns at Kum Kale <b>on</b> <b>the</b> northern <b>Asian</b> <b>coast</b> and at Sedd el Bahr <b>on</b> <b>the</b> southern tip of the Gallipoli Peninsula, while the naval bombardment shifted to batteries between Kum Kale and Kephez.|$|R

And there died two brave heroes, Idmon and Tiphys the wise helmsman: one died of an evil sickness, and one a wild boar slew. So the heroes heaped a mound above them, and set upon it an oar on high, and left them there to sleep together, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> far-off Lycian shore. But Idas killed the boar, and avenged Tiphys; and Ancaios took the rudder and was helmsman, and steered them <b>on</b> toward <b>the</b> east.|$|R
5|$|Octopus {{fisheries}} exist {{around the}} world with total catches varying between 245,320 and 322,999 metric tons from 1986 to 1995. The world catch peaked in 2007 at 380,000 tons, and fell by a tenth by 2012. Methods to capture octopuses include pots, traps, trawls, snares, drift fishing, spearing, hooking and hand collection. Octopus is eaten in many cultures and is a common food <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean and <b>Asian</b> <b>coasts.</b> <b>The</b> arms and sometimes other body parts are prepared in various ways, often varying by species or geography. Live octopuses are eaten in several countries {{around the world}}, including the US. Animal welfare groups have objected to this practice <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis that octopuses can experience pain. Octopuses have a food conversion efficiency greater than that of chickens, making octopus aquaculture a possibility.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{access to medical}} care for Asians and Pacific Islanders in the United States, using a survey of patients receiving care provided by a physician group practice association concentrated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> West <b>Coast.</b> <b>Asians</b> and Pacific Islanders who had used their health plan {{in the past year}} had worse access to health care than whites, blacks, His-panics, and Native American or other ethnicities. <b>The</b> odds that <b>Asians</b> reported that they had adequate access ranged from about one quarter to three quarters that of whites, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> measure. Cultural differences and associated communication problems may explain the access problems experienced by Asians. Interventions need to be devel-oped to address the problems with access to services, and better translation services may {{play an important role in}} improving access to care for Asians. Future studies need to clar-ify why Asians were more vulnerable to the access problems examined than other ethnic groups that might experience similar barriers.

50|$|Haplogroup M30 {{used to be}} a part of M4 haplogroup {{distinguished}} by G15431A.
