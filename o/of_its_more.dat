5|$|Boron is a {{chemical}} element with symbolB and atomic number5. Produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae {{and not by}} stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in the Solar system and in the Earth's crust. Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>more</b> common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite. The largest known boron deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals.|$|E
5|$|Since 1991, Fremantle Prison {{has been}} conserved as a {{recognised}} heritage site, and various restoration works have been undertaken. New uses {{have been found}} for some buildings within the prison, which has also become a significant tourist attraction. The process of obtaining World Heritage listing {{as part of the}} Australian Convict Sites submission focused historical interpretation and conservation efforts on the prison's convict era (18501886), at the expense <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>more</b> recent history, including Aboriginal prisoners held there.|$|E
5|$|The work's moralising tone is {{apparent}} from some <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>more</b> overtly dark iconography, its choice of saints, {{and how the}} scales tilt far lower beneath {{the weight of the}} damned than the saved. The damned to Christ's left are more numerous and less detailed than the saved to his right. In these ways it can be compared to Matthias Grünewald's Isenheim Altarpiece, which served much the same purpose, having been commissioned for the Monastery of St. Anthony in Isenheim, which cared for the dying.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russo-Japanese War the Imperial Russian Navy was in a {{state of}} confusion. Its leadership, tactics and ship designs had all been cast into disrepute by its {{repeated}} defeats by the Japanese at the Battle of Tsushima, Battle off Ulsan and the Battle of the Yellow Sea. The Navy took quite some time to absorb the design lessons from the war while the government reformed the Naval Ministry and forced many <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>more</b> conservative officers to retire. It conducted a design contest for a dreadnought in 1906, but the Duma refused to authorize it, preferring to spend the money on rebuilding the Army.|$|E
5|$|Scarborough's {{climate is}} {{moderate}} for Canada {{due to its}} southerly location within the country and its proximity to Lake Ontario. It has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa/Dfb), with warm, humid summers and generally cold winters. Mean temperature and precipitation tends to be slightly lower than the downtown core or south Etobicoke for instance, {{due in part to}} the weather station being farther from the moderating influence of the lake and also because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>more</b> northeast location. Conditions vary based on proximity to the lake, with fog more common in the south and areas close to the lake noticeably cooler on hot summer days.|$|E
5|$|The direct {{predecessor}} to the Vlaams Blok was the People's Union, {{which was}} founded in 1954 as the successor to the Christian Flemish People's Union electoral alliance, that had successfully run for election earlier the same year. The party had been careful to choose its leaders from nationalist circles that had not collaborated with the Nazis. While Flemish separatists had been suspicious of the People's Union since its outset, it became clear by the 1970s that the party had moved to a moderate left-liberal course, which led to the defection <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>more</b> radical members. The remaining nationalist hardliners finally rejected the party's participation in a new five-party government coalition in 1977, and particularly the Egmont pact, believing it had conceded too much to the francophone government parties.|$|E

5|$|The {{whole of}} the Pendennis site {{was placed in the}} {{guardianship}} of the Ministry of Works and opened to visitors; the Ministry focused its attention on the 16th-century castle and many of the more modern buildings were destroyed. The barracks were used as a youth hostel between 1963 and 2000. The heritage agency English Heritage took over control of the castle in 1984, and placed a greater priority on the conservation <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>more</b> modern features. Extensive work was carried out across the castle in the 1990s to refurbish the fortifications and open new facilities for visitors, accompanied by archaeological surveys and excavations; in the 2000s, the sergeant's mess and the custodian's house were converted into holiday cottages.|$|E
5|$|Enix was a Japanese {{video game}} {{publishing}} company founded in September 1975 by Yasuhiro Fukushima. Initially a tabloid publisher named Eidansha Boshu Service Center, it was renamed to Enix in 1982, and shortly thereafter ventured into video game publishing for Japanese home computers {{such as the}} PC-8800 series, the X1 series, and the FM-7. Enix initially found games to release by holding contests for programming hobbyists and publishing the winners, with the first titles appearing in February 1983. Enix continued to hold contests and publish the winners through 1993. When Enix moved into traditional publishing for video game consoles in 1985, it began with ports of two <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>more</b> successful games, Door Door (1983) and The Portopia Serial Murder Case (1983). From that point onward, Enix served as a publisher for both video games developed independently by other companies {{as well as for}} titles in franchises owned by Enix and created by licensed developers. Enix's flagship franchise was the Dragon Quest series of console games, developed primarily by Chunsoft; some of the games, such as Dragon Quest VII (2000), have sold millions of copies, and the series as a whole has sold over 68 million copies as of 2016.|$|E
