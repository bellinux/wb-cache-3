5|$|Following {{the release}} of Fear of Music in 1979, Talking Heads and Eno sought to make an album that would dispel notions of {{the group as a}} mere vehicle for {{frontman}} and chief lyricist David Byrne. Drawing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, the group experimented with African polyrhythms, funk, and electronics, recording instrumental tracks as a series of sampled and looped grooves, an innovative technique at the time. Recording sessions also incorporated a variety of side musicians, including guitarist Adrian Belew, singer Nona Hendryx, and trumpet player Jon Hassell.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that land use changes (LUC) associated with climate variations are affecting the human wellbeing. This paper conducted a revisit to relevant researches <b>on</b> <b>the</b> impacts of LUC on human wellbeing via specifically altering the ecosystem provisioning services.

Then the quantitative {{identification of the}} impacts of LUC on ecosystem provisioning services was commented <b>on.</b> In <b>the</b> light of enhanced observation and valuation methods, several approaches to ecosystem services and improved models for assessing those ecosystem services were assessed. The major indicators used to uncover <b>the</b> <b>influences</b> <b>of</b> LUC <b>on</b> human wellbeing were summarized including the increase of inputs and the reduction of outputs in production and the augmented health risk induced by the irrational land uses. Finally, this paper uncovered the research gaps and proposed several research directions to address these gaps...|$|R
25|$|Early, pre-sectarian Buddhism had a {{somewhat}} vague {{position on the}} existence and effect of deities.

Of the major schools, Theravada tends to de-emphasize the gods, whereas Mahayana and Vajrayana do not.|$|E

25|$|Baron {{has been}} outspoken <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> terroir, the {{emphasis}} on vineyard selection, fruit maturity, and other factors in creating Silver Oak's distinct style. Baron's Silver Oak Cabernet Sauvignon is typically aged for about 24-25 months exclusively in American oak barrels, following {{in the tradition of}} Justin Meyer. He ages Twomey's Merlot typically for 18 months in French oak barrels, and six times during the aging process the wine is racked from barrel to barrel, something known as soutirage traditionnel. Soutirage is the method of moving wine from one barrel to another using gravity rather than a pump, which can be disruptive to a wine. This process softens tannins, clarifies the wine and enhances aromatic qualities.|$|E
25|$|Most {{of these}} {{perceptions}} arise from Wagner's published opinions {{on a number}} of topics. Wagner was a voluminous writer and published essays and pamphlets {{on a wide range of}} subjects throughout his life. Wagner's writing style is verbose, unclear and turgid, which has greatly added to the confusion about his opinions. Several of his writings have achieved some notoriety, in particular his essay Das Judenthum in der Musik, (Jewishness in Music), a critical view <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> Jews in German culture and society at that time. The essays he wrote in his final years were also controversial, with many readers perceiving them to employ an endorsement of racist beliefs.
