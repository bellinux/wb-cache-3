For example, financial institutions often offer asset management or brokerage services to their clients. The assets managed or brokered as part of these offered services (often securities) usually belong to the individual clients directly or in trust, although the company provides management, depository or other services to the client. The company itself has no direct claim to the assets, so it does not record them on its balance sheet (they are off-balance sheet assets), while usually has some basic fiduciary duties {{with respect to the}} client.

Controlling for cross-country differences in regulatory and environmental conditions, we find that, on average, cost efficiency increases irrespective of whether we use OBS or non-interest income, although the results for profit efficiency are mixed.

I find that on-balance sheet securitizations demonstrate greater effects on the originator's CDS premium than <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> securitizations in the business cycle. While <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> securitizations’ effects on the originator's CDS premium become significantly stronger after 2007 when the economy declines, on-balance sheet securitizations’ effects on the originator's CDS premium do not experience a significant change {{with the onset of}} the recession.

Effective leverage (taking into account <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> securitization) is especially relevant for the US, where GAAP accounting rules for securitization allowed until 2009 a underestimation of on balance <b>sheet</b> <b>items.</b> Over 2001 – 2010, we document that US BHCs which are more involved in securitization have a more pro-cyclical leverage. We also show that in the pre-crisis period securitization dominates the business model in determining the leverage pro-cyclicality {{to the point that}} even commercial banks highly involved in securitization had a pro-cyclical behavior. We document that the period-long relation between securitization and capital ratios was week. The effect on leverage pro-cyclicality of the 2004 changes in regulation (the new SEC net capital rule and the exemption from the FASB directive on consolidation of SPVs) was absent for investment banks, and mixed for commercial banks highly involved in securitization.

For example, {{a company that is}} being sued for damages would not include the potential legal liability on its balance sheet until a legal judgment against it is likely and the amount of the judgment can be estimated; if the amount at risk is small, it may not appear on the company's accounts until a judgment is rendered.|$|E

40|$|While leases {{are widely}} used to finance {{productive}} assets in the U. S, lease accounting has been sharply criticized for providing incomplete and unreliable information to investors because many leases are arranged <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> as operating leases. As such, a higher cost of equity capital may be required by investors to compensate for unrecorded liabilities and imperfect information. In this dissertation, I provide the empirical evidence as to how equity market participants perceive the <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> leases. ^ First, I investigate the firm characteristics that determine the choice on operating versus capital leases. By summarizing the results from prior literature, I identify the determinants from three areas: operating risks, financial constraints and tax-driven incentives. The results suggest that both economic and opportunistic reasons drive a firm 2 ̆ 7 s lease choice. Specifically, fast-growing, financially constrained, or low-tax firms opt for <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases. ^ Second, I {{examine the impact of}} <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases on the cost of equity, and whether it would be different from that of capital leases or conventional debt. The results suggest that <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases are “value relevant” as indicated by an increased cost of equity capital being associated with greater use of operating leases. However, investors also seem to suffer from the <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> position of disclosed operating leases. The leverage effect of operating leases is largely attenuated relative to capital leases and conventional debt. ^ Third, I explore the role of information intermediaries in compensation for the deficiency in accounting for leases. The results indicate that the cost of equity, with respect to the use of <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> leases, diminishes in greater analyst followings and the existence of credit ratings. Specifically, the diminishing effect of 2 ̆ 7 financial analysts is more pronounced on <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases than that on capital leases and conventional debt. Lastly, whether a firm is audited by a big 4 / 5 / 6 / 8 firm appears to have no effect on either off- or on-balance sheet leases. ^ This study contributes to the Financial Accounting Standard Board 2 ̆ 7 s lease accounting project and helps investors assess the risk of firms with <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> leases. ...|$|R
