40|$|The sodium ion-dependent citrate {{carrier of}} Klebsiella pneumoniae (CitS) {{contains}} 12 hydrophobic potential transmembrane domains. Surprisingly, an alkaline phosphatase fusion study in Escherichia coil {{has suggested that}} only 9 of these domains are embedded in the membrane, and 3 are translocated to the periplasm (van Geest, M., and Lolkema, J. S. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 25582 - 25589), To provide independent data on the topology and mode of membrane insertion of CitS, we have investigated its insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. By using in vitro translation of model proteins {{in the presence of}} dog pancreas microsomes, each of the putative transmembrane segments of CitS was assayed for its potency to insert into the ER membrane, both as an isolated segment {{as well as in the}} context of COOH-terminal truncation mutants. All 12 segments were able to insert into the membrane as N-cyt- C-lum signal anchor sequences, In a series of COOH-terminal truncation mutants, the segments inserted in a sequential way except for one segment, segment Vb, which was translocated to the lumen. Hydrophobic segments VIII and M, which, according to the alkaline phosphatase fusion study, are in the periplasm <b>off,</b> <b>coil,</b> form a helical hairpin in the ER membrane. These observations suggest a topology for CitS with 11 transmembrane segments and also demonstrate that the sequence requirements for signal anchor and stop transfer function are different...|$|E
40|$|Cholera toxin and {{the related}} Escherichia coil heat-labile {{enterotoxin}} are hexameric proteins comprising one B-subunit and five B-subunits. In this paper we report the generation and characterization of a monoclonal antibody, designated LDS 47, that recognizes and precipitates in vivo assembly intermediates of the B-subunit (EtxB) of E. coil heat-labile enterotoxin. The monoclonal antibody is unable to precipitate native B-subunit pentamers, thus making LDS 47 a useful probe for studying {{the early stages of}} enterotoxin biogenesis. The use of LDS 47 to monitor the in vivo turnover of newly synthesized B-subunits in the periplasm <b>off.</b> <b>coil</b> demonstrated that (i) the turnover of unassembled B-subunits followed an apparent first order process and (ii) it occurred concomitantly with the assembly of native B-pentamers (k = 0. 317 +/- 0. 170 min(- 1); t(1 / 2) = 2. 2 min). No other proteins were co-precipitated with the newly synthesized B-subunits; a finding that implies that unassembled B-subunits do not stably associate with other periplasmic proteins prior to their assembly into a macromolecular complex. The use of overlapping synthetic peptides corresponding to the entire EtxB polypeptide demonstrated that the epitope recognized by LDS 47 is located within the amino-terminal decapeptide of the B-subunit. From the x-ray structural analysis of the toxin (Sixma, T., Kalk, K., van Zanten, B., Dauter, Z., Kingma, J., Witholt, B., and Hol, W. G. J. (1993) J. Mel. Biol. 230, 890 - 918), this region appears to resemble a curved finger that clasps the adjacent B-subunit. Thus, this region might be expected to be exposed in the unfolded or unassembled subunit, but to become partially buried upon assembly and thus inaccessible to recognition by the monoclonal antibody...|$|E

A galvanically separated circuit is designed to implement the new method by transforming the current of the sending coils to a DC voltage and then comparing it to the detection threshold. Finite element simulations were carried out to predict the value of the detection threshold. Both simulation and experimental results show that the circuit fulfils the detection requirements with high precision and high detection height. The proposed method represents a smart, efficient and low cost detection technique for inductive systems with a movable receiver, independently on position and speed...|$|R

40|$|Electromagnetic {{induction}} (EMI) measurements return {{an apparent}} electrical conductivity {{that represents a}} weighted average of the electrical conductivity distribution over a certain depth range. Different sensing depths are obtained for different orientations, different <b>coil</b> <b>off</b> sets, and different frequencies, which, in principle, {{can be used for}} a multi-layer inversion. However, instrumental shifts, which often occur in EMI data, prevent the use of quantitative multi-layer inversion. Recently, a new calibration method was developed that uses electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) inversion results and returns quantitative apparent conductivity values. Here, we introduce an inversion scheme that uses calibrated EMI data and inverts for a two-layer earth. The inversion minimizes the misfit between the measured and modeled magnetic field by a combined global and local search and does not use any smoothing parameter. Application of this new scheme to synthetic data demonstrates its efficacy in providing the required physical property information. Inversion of calibrated experimental EMI data using horizontal coplanar (HCP) and vertical coplanar (VCP) loop configurations, <b>coil</b> <b>off</b> sets of 1 and 1. 22 m, and frequencies of 8 and 15 kHz provides lateral and vertical conductivity variations very similar to those observed in an elaborate ERT experiment.
