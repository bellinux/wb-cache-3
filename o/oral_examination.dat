5|$|The {{next step}} was to take an <b>oral</b> <b>examination</b> and to {{diagnose}} a patient. After less than two weeks, he took his degree and became a doctor, at the age of 28. During the summer, Linnaeus met a friend from Uppsala, Peter Artedi. Before their departure from Uppsala, Artedi and Linnaeus had decided should one of them die, the survivor would finish the other's work. Ten weeks later, Artedi drowned in one of the canals of Amsterdam, and his unfinished manuscript on the classification of fish was left to Linnaeus to complete.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Heidelberg, Goebbels {{wrote his}} {{doctoral}} thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz, a minor 19th century romantic dramatist. He {{had hoped to}} write his thesis {{under the supervision of}} Friedrich Gundolf, who at that time was a well known literary historian. It did not seem to bother Goebbels that Gundolf was Jewish. However, Gundolf was no longer performing teaching duties, so he directed Goebbels to associate professor Max Freiherr von Waldberg. Waldberg was also Jewish. It was Waldberg who recommended Goebbels write his thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz. After submitting the thesis and passing his <b>oral</b> <b>examination,</b> Goebbels earned his PhD in 1921.|$|E

5|$|Klein had {{the power}} to make or break {{academic}} careers, so Born felt compelled to atone by submitting an entry for the prize. Because Klein refused to supervise him, Born arranged for Carl Runge to be his supervisor. Woldemar Voigt and Karl Schwarzschild became his other examiners. Starting from his paper, Born developed the equations for the stability conditions. As he became more interested in the topic, he had an apparatus constructed that could test his predictions experimentally. On 13 June 1906, the rector announced that Born had won the prize. A month later, he passed his <b>oral</b> <b>examination</b> and was awarded his PhD in mathematics magna cum laude.|$|E
5|$|Most {{students}} {{participate in}} the Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP). In 2009, the school held eight AMSP seminars. AMSP is intended to educate students in military arts and science, and focuses on operational art and covers a variety of subjects, including military problem solving; military theory and history, military doctrine, operational planning; battle dynamics, operational theory and practice, contemporary military operations, {{and the application of}} national elements of power. Besides classroom studies and operational exercises, students must complete a research monograph and an <b>oral</b> <b>examination.</b> After graduating, officers serve on a division, corps, or Army Service Component Command staff, or in a functional area assignment.|$|E

Assessing clinical competence requires that `competence? be clearly defined {{prior to the start}} of any clinical programme. In this article, we report on our experience in using clinical <b>oral</b> <b>examinations</b> in assessing competence in second year undergraduate radiation therapy students. The shortcomings of clinical <b>oral</b> <b>examinations</b> such as `leaking? of the agenda are addressed and more positive attributes, such as increased collaboration between academic and clinical radiation therapists are discussed...|$|R

A study on the objectivity of <b>oral</b> <b>examinations</b> was replicated. We found very high correlations between the evaluations of examiner and assessor and high correlations between the examinees’ self-evaluations after the exam. Examinees’ self-evaluations before the examinations correlated at about 0. 48 with the marks in the oral examina-tion. The results concerning preparation do not uniformly show that preparation in a group and mutual examination lead to better marks compared to preparation alone...|$|R
