40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} an M=M= 1 queueing {{system in which}} the server can serve at two different speeds. The speed of the server is regulated by the content of a credit buffer. The performance measures of interest are the sojourn time distribution of customers and the joint distribution of the content of the waiting room and the content of the credit buffer. This system is a simple model for a <b>traffic</b> <b>regulation</b> scheme (two-level <b>traffic</b> shaper) at the edge of an ATM network. Numerical results are presented which demonstrate the effect of the regulation scheme. 1 Introduction Modern ATM telecommunication networks have the capability of carrying all kinds of traffic such as data, voice and video. Because of the high quality of service demanded by the users of these networks on one hand, and the bursty nature of the traffic offered by the users on the <b>other</b> hand, <b>traffic</b> <b>regulation</b> at the edges of these networks has become an important issue.

40|$|AbstractResearch that {{addresses}} policy measures {{to increase the}} adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has discussed government regulations such as California’s Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) or penalties on petroleum-based fuels. Relatively few articles have addressed policy measures designed to increase the adoption of EVs by incentives to influence car buyers’ voluntary behavior. This article examines the effects of such policy measures. Two of these attributes are monetary measures, two <b>others</b> are <b>traffic</b> <b>regulations,</b> and the <b>other</b> three are related to investments in charging infrastructure. Consumer preferences were assessed using a choice-based conjoint analysis {{on an individual basis}} by applying the hierarchical Bayes method. In addition, the Kano method was used to elicit consumer satisfaction. This not only enabled the identification of preferences but also why preferences were based on either features that were “must-haves” or on attributes that were not expected but were highly attractive and, thus, led to high satisfaction. The results of surveys conducted in 20 countries in 5 continents showed that the installation of a charging network on freeways is an absolute necessity. This was completely independent from the average mileage driven per day. High cash grants were appreciated as attractive; however, combinations of lower grants with charging facilities resulted in similar preference shares in market simulations for each country. The results may serve as initial guidance for policymakers and practitioners in improving their incentive programs for electric mobility...|$|R

However, the trafficking in persons cases increase dramatically and the law enforcement of trafficiking in persons was not function well.

40|$|Metaverses {{provide a}} {{framework}} for developing distributed 3 D Internet applications where users gain presence through the proxy of an avatar. They offer much of the engagement of on line 3 D games but support heterogeneous applications. From the network perspective metaverses are similar to games in that timeliness is important but differ in that their traffic is less regular and requires more bandwidth. The motivation for our study flows from using virtual worlds to support experiential learning and to promote cultural heritage; the applicability of the results is wider. The responsiveness of the system is effected by interactions between avatar activity, application <b>traffic</b> <b>regulation</b> and network conditions.

40|$|International audienceIn Europe roads carry 2, 565. 4 {{thousand}} million passengers-miles, and 741. 3 {{thousand million}} tons-miles. These figures {{are very close}} to the US figures. The continuous growth in social costs linked to the increase of traffic, led European policy makers to develop a strategy that corresponds to the payment of the infrastructure used. For policy makers, pricing is only one instrument among <b>others</b> (<b>others</b> are: <b>régulation,</b> <b>traffic</b> control, infrastructure and land-use planning), but it has an important interest to adapt demand and supply from an economic and social point of view.
