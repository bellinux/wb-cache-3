2500|$|The idea of <b>opening</b> <b>drainage</b> canals {{first came}} about after {{a flood of}} the colonial city in 1555. The first canal was begun in 1605 to drain the waters of Lake Zumpango north through Huehuetoca which would also divert waters from the Cuautitlán River away from the lakes and toward the Tula River. This project was {{undertaken}} by Enrico Martínez and he devoted 25years {{of his life to}} it. He did succeed in building a canal in this area, calling it Nochistongo, leading waters to the Tula Valley, but the drainage was not sufficient to avoid the Great Flood of 1629 in the city. Another canal, which would be dubbed the [...] "Grand Canal" [...] was built parallel to the Nochistongo one ending in Tequixquiac. The Grand Canal consists of one main canal, which measures [...] in diameter and [...] long. [...] The drainage project was continued after independence, with three secondary canals, built between 1856 and 1867. During the presidency of Porfirio Díaz (r. 1876 - 1911) again became a prioirity.Porfirio Díaz completed all of it officially in 1894 although work continued thereafter. Despite the Grand Canal's drainage capacity, it did not solve the problem of flooding in the city.|$|E

Simple parapneumonic effusions are managed by drainage with or without rinsing with normal saline, while in advanced empyema, instillations with fibrinolytic agents have proved safe and effective. Sometimes, video-assisted thoracoscopic or conventional surgery is necessary to clear the pleural space, while in complicated cases, extensive surgical procedures are warranted...|$|E

40|$|The Oak Ridges Moraine {{is a major}} physiographic {{feature of}} south-central Ontario, {{extending}} from Rice Lake westward to the Niagara Escarpment. While much previous work has largely postulated a relatively simple {{the origin of the}} moraine, recent investigations have concentrated on delineating the discernible glacigenic deposits (or landform architectural elements) which comprise the complex mosaic of the Oak Ridges Moraine. This study investigates the sedimentology of the Bloomington fan complex, one of the oldest elements of the Oak Ridges Moraine. The main sediment body of the Bloomington fan complex was deposited during early stages of the formation of the Oak Ridges Moraine, when the ice subdivided, and formed a confined, interlobate lake basin between the northern and southern lobes. Deposition from several conduits produced a fan complex characterized by multiple, laterally overlapping, fan bodies. It appears that the fans were active sequentially in an eastward direction, until the formation of the Bloomington fan complex was dominated by the largest fan fed by a conduit near the northeastern margin of the deposit. Following deposition of the fan complex, the northern and southern ice margins continued to retreat, <b>opening</b> <b>drainage</b> outlets to the west and causing water levels to drop in the lake basin. Glaciofluvial sediment was deposited at this time, cutting into the underlying fan complex. Re-advancing northern ice then closed westerly outlets, and caused water levels to increase, initiating the re-advance of the southern ice. As the southern ice approached the Bloomington fan, it deposited an ice-marginal sediment complex consisting of glacigenic sediment gravity flows, and glaciolacustrine and glaciofluvial sediments exhibiting north and northwesterly paleocurrents. Continued advance of the southern ice, overriding the fan complex, ii produced large-scale glaciotectonic deformation structures, and deposited the Halton Till. The subaqueous fan depositional model that is postulated for the Bloomington fan complex differs from published models due to the complex facies associations produced by the multiple conduit sources of sediment feeding the fans. The fluctuating northern and southern ice margins, which moved across the study area in opposite directions, controlled the water level in the interlobate basin and caused major changes in depositional environments. The influence of these two lobes also caused deposition from two distinct source directions. Finally, erosion, deposition, and deformation of the deposit with the readvance of the southern ice contributed further to the complexity of the Bloomington fan complex...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{document}} anatomic {{effects of}} phacoemulsification versus combined phaco-trabeculectomy on drainage angle in primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG). METHODS: Indentation gonioscopy and ultrasound biomicroscopy were performed preoperatively, {{and then at}} 1 year after phacoemulsification alone or combined phaco-trabeculectomy in PACG patients. RESULTS: Seventy-two PACG eyes of 72 patients were included in this study. Thirty-eight eyes were randomized into receiving phacoemulsification alone, whereas 34 eyes had combined phaco-trabeculectomy. The mean extent of synechial angle closure was significantly reduced from 266. 4 ° to 198. 9 ° (P< 0. 001) by phacoemulsification alone, and from 266. 0 ° to 227. 2 ° (P= 0. 03) by combined surgery. The mean angle opening distance (AOD 500) measured by ultrasound biomicroscopy was significantly increased from 208. 0 to 468. 0 μm (P< 0. 001) by phacoemulsification, and from 214. 6 to 344. 4 μm (P< 0. 001) by combined surgery. The mean trabecular-ciliary process distance was significantly increased from 824. 6 to 1043. 6 μm (P< 0. 001) by phacoemulsification, and from 800. 9 to 951. 5 μm (P= 0. 01) by combined surgery. The mean anterior chamber depth was significantly increased from 1798. 6 to 3528. 4 μm (P< 0. 001) by phacoemulsification alone, and from 1781. 6 to 3297. 8 μm (P< 0. 001) by combined surgery. Phacoemulsification alone resulted in significantly greater postoperative angle opening distance 500 (P< 0. 001) and anterior chamber depth (P< 0. 001) than phaco-trabeculectomy.

The first one is the ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) including treatment with catheters that are placed proximal to the obstruction to take out excess CSF. Mortality, morbidity and complication rates are high for VPS and 50  % of patients face various problems within 2  years [4, 6, 9]. Thus, shunt revision is generally required for most of the patients. The second one [endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV)] is described as entering into the brain with an endoscopic procedure and <b>opening</b> a new <b>drainage</b> pathway that bypasses the obstruction inside of the brain. ETV is a more physiological treatment than VPS. The most important complication with this method is bleeding due to injury to the basilar artery or one of its branches that courses near the surgery site, and this may lead to death.|$|R
40|$|Background: Malaria {{prevention}} and treatment constitute an unbearable economic burden to most African countries, especially south of the Sahara, where about 500 million cases occur annually. The problem of malaria among adolescents has largely been overshadowed by the huge burden of the disease among young children. Attention to malaria among adolescents has also been diverted by the huge burden of HIV/AIDS among adolescents. Some surveys reveal {{a lack of knowledge}} and many misconceptions about the transmission and treatment of malaria, which could adversely affect malaria control measures and antimalarial therapy. Such a knowledge gap could have an adverse effect on school children, who could be used as change agents and as role models for their siblings and peers in the malaria control strategy. Objectives: To determine the malaria prevention practices of school adolescents in the coastal community of Calabar, Nigeria. Method: This was a cross-sectional survey involving secondary schools in southern Calabar. Four hundred adolescents were randomly selected from the 4565 learners in 5 out of 17 secondary schools in southern Calabar, Cross River State, Nigeria. A self-administered, semi-structured questionnaire was administered to the respondents. Results: Most respondents (77. 5 %) were aware that the vector transmits the malaria parasite through biting. Fewer respondents would prevent malaria attacks by clearing the vegetation in the peri-domestic environment (13. 5 %), filling up potholes (16. 9 %), <b>opening</b> up <b>drainage</b> (11 %), using insecticide-treated nets (25. 7 %) or using antimalarial drugs (11. 2 %). Less than one-tenth (8 %) would use various other methods such as not accepting unscreened blood, while only 11 % obtained the information from their teachers. Conclusion: The study identified knowledge gaps among school children. There is a need to empower teachers with information about the cause of malaria and prevention strategies. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background Glaucoma is {{the leading}} cause of {{irreversible}} blindness. Although primary open-angle glaucoma is more common, primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) is more likely to result in irreversible blindness. By 2020, 5 · 3 million people worldwide will be blind because of PACG. The current standard care for PACG is a stepped approach of a combination of laser iridotomy surgery (to open the drainage angle) and medical treatment (to reduce intraocular pressure). If these treatments fail, glaucoma surgery (eg, trabeculectomy) is indicated. It has been proposed that, because the lens of the eye plays a major role in the mechanisms leading to PACG, early clear lens extraction will improve glaucoma control by <b>opening</b> the <b>drainage</b> angle. This procedure might reduce the need for drugs and glaucoma surgery, maintain good visual acuity, and improve quality of life compared with standard care. EAGLE aims to evaluate whether early lens extraction improves patient-reported, clinical outcomes, and cost-effectiveness, compared with standard care. Methods/Design EAGLE is a multicentre pragmatic randomized trial. All people presenting to the recruitment centres in the UK and east Asia with newly diagnosed PACG and who are at least 50 years old are eligible. The primary outcomes are EQ- 5 D, intraocular pressure, and incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Other outcomes are: vision and glaucoma-specific patient-reported outcomes, visual acuity, visual field, angle closure, number of medications, additional surgery (e. g., trabeculectomy), costs to the health services and patients, and adverse events. A single main analysis will be done at the end of the trial, after three years of follow-up. The analysis will be based on all participants as randomized (intention to treat). 400 participants (200 in each group) will be recruited, to have 90...|$|R
