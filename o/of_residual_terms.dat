40|$|Our present {{relativistic}} {{part of the}} geodetic VLBI {{model for}} Earthbound antennas is a consensus model which is considered as a standard for processing high-precision VLBI observations. It was created as a compromise between a variety of relativistic VLBI models proposed by different authors as documented in the IERS Conventions 2010. The accuracy of the consensus model is in the picosecond range for the group delay {{but this is not}} sufficient for current geodetic pur- poses. This paper provides a fully documented derivation of a new relativistic model having an accuracy substantially higher than one picosecond and based upon a well accepted formalism of relativistic celestial mechanics, astrometry and geodesy. Our new model fully confirms the consensus model at the picosecond level and in several respects goes to a great extent beyond it. More specifically, terms related to the acceleration of the geocenter are considered and kept in the model, the gravitational time-delay due to a massive body (planet, Sun, etc.) with arbitrary mass and spin-multipole moments is derived taking into account the motion of the body, and a new formalism for the time-delay problem of radio sources located at finite distance from VLBI stations is presented. Thus, the paper presents a substantially elaborated theoretical justification of the consensus model and its significant extension that allows researchers to make concrete estimates of the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>residual</b> <b>terms</b> of this model for any conceivable configuration of the source of light, massive bodies, and VLBI stations. The largest terms in the relativistic time delay which can affect the current VLBI observations are from the quadrupole and the angular momentum of the gravitating bodies that are known from the literature.

40|$|Key message: In the QTL {{analysis}} of multi-parent populations, {{the inclusion of}} QTLs with various types of effects {{can lead to a}} better description of the phenotypic variation and increased power. Abstract: For the type of QTL effect in QTL models for multi-parent populations (MPPs), various options exist to define them with respect to their origin. They can be modelled as referring to close parental lines or to further away ancestral founder lines. QTL models for MPPs can also be characterized by the homo- or heterogeneity of variance for polygenic effects. The most suitable model for the origin of the QTL effect and the homo- or heterogeneity of polygenic effects may be a function of the genetic distance distribution between the parents of MPPs. We investigated the statistical properties of various QTL detection models for MPPs taking into account the genetic distances between the parents of the MPP. We evaluated models with different assumptions about the QTL effect and the form <b>of</b> the <b>residual</b> <b>term</b> using cross validation. For the EU-NAM data, we showed that it can be useful to mix in the same model QTLs with different types of effects (parental, ancestral, or bi-allelic). The benefit <b>of</b> using cross-specific <b>residual</b> <b>terms</b> to handle the heterogeneity of variance was less obvious for this particular data set...|$|R

The combinatorial part takes into account the free volume (FV) effect, which plays a significant role in polymer systems. The validity of this model is demonstrated by calculating the solvent activities in 36 polymer solutions in comparison with Entropic-FV (EFV) and UNIFAC-FV methods. The total average absolute deviations (AAD) from the experimental observations are 8. 27, 6. 38, and 1. 64 for EFV, UNIFAC-FV, and the present method, respectively.

While the attitudes we capture in our measure were collected more than 10  years before the period of analysis, a bad labour market may be persistent over time. We include covariates to control for the labour market conditions, but acknowledging that this is not sufficient, we proceed as follows. To check whether some other factor determines both the level of attitudes and the differences in income and quality of life in the region, we include in one of the robustness tests another group in our analysis, immigrants from developed countries, that we expect not to be significantly affected by attitudes. The idea is that if our estimation of the effect of attitudes on income and amenities is the result of some other factor that produces lower income, we should estimate the same effect on this placebo group.|$|R
