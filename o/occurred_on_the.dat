5|$|On Kauai, the six-hour total at Mount Waialeale was 6.17inches (157mm). Flash {{flooding}} <b>occurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Hanalei River, {{which resulted}} in the closure of the Kuhio Highway at the Hanalei Bridge. Rapid water level rises also <b>occurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Wailua River and the Hanapepe River, though no significant damages were reported along these waterways.|$|E
30|$|Observations by ocean-bottom seismometers in the {{southern}} Ryukyu Trench have revealed that <b>the</b> LFEs <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plate interface (Arai et al. 2016). Although the observational periods are only 3  months, {{the distribution of the}} epicenters is consistent with the 12 -year long-term distribution. This suggests that most LFEs would <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plate interface; however, some might <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> splay faults. Long-term observations using ocean-bottom seismometers placed above the hypocenter area of LFEs would reveal whether all LFEs <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plate interface.|$|R
2500|$|Between 50 and 80% of diaphragmatic {{ruptures}} <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left side. [...] It {{is possible}} that the liver, which is situated in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, cushions the diaphragm. However, injuries <b>occurring</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left side are also easier to detect in X-ray films. [...] Half of diaphragmatic ruptures that <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right side are associated with liver injury. Injuries <b>occurring</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right are associated with a higher rate of death and more numerous and serious accompanying injuries. Bilateral diaphragmatic rupture, which occurs in 1–2% of ruptures, is associated with a much higher death rate (mortality) than injury that <b>occurs</b> <b>on</b> just one side.|$|R
25|$|Lupus erythematosus, with lesions more {{commonly}} <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> palate and appear as centrally ulcerated or erythematous with radiating white striae. In contrast, OLP and lichenoid reactions rarely <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> palate, and the striae are randomly arranged rather than radial.|$|R
5|$|A light {{storm surge}} of 1 to 2 feet (0.3 to 0.6 m) was {{reported}} along the northeast Florida coast into southeastern Georgia. The storm's outer rainbands dropped light rainfall of around 1 inch (25 mm) across coastal Florida, northward to North Carolina. A station on Bermuda reported sustained winds of 47 mph (76 km/h), with gusts to 78 mph (126 km/h). Only light damage <b>occurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island.|$|E
5|$|A {{recession}} in the 1930s was halted by increasing international tensions as World War II loomed; Sheffield's steel factories were set to work manufacturing weapons and ammunition for the war effort. As a result, the city became a target for bombing raids, the heaviest of which <b>occurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nights of 12 and 15 December 1940, {{now known as the}} Sheffield Blitz. More than 660lives were lost and many buildings destroyed.|$|E
5|$|A {{separate}} {{manifestation of}} the Christmas truce in December 1914 <b>occurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Eastern front, where the first move originated from the Austro-Hungarian commanders, at some uncertain level of the military hierarchy. The Russians responded positively and soldiers eventually met in no man’s land.|$|E

5|$|About 20 eruptions have <b>occurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mono–Inyo Craters chain at {{intervals}} of 250 to 700 years {{during the past}} 5,000 years. Seismic soundings and lava composition indicate that these eruptions most likely originated from discrete and small magma bodies. The rate of eruption over the last 1,000 years has increased, with at least 12eruptions occurring.|$|E
5|$|After TransNet was renewed in November 2004, {{planning}} {{continued for}} widening the remaining portion of SR76 west of I-15, {{due to the}} frequent accidents that <b>occurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eastern portion, although some claimed that the habits of drivers were at fault. The 2007 environmental impact report recommended constructing the new roadway along {{the route of the}} old one, rather than moving the entire highway south.|$|E
5|$|After the JNA {{captured}} Vukovar, it transferred a {{large number}} of the inhabitants of the city to the detention facility in Dalj on 20 November. The transfer <b>occurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of a request by Goran Hadžić, political leader of the SAO SBWS. Those suspected of involvement in the fighting were interrogated and tortured, and at least 35 were executed.|$|E
50|$|The {{arrangement}} of antheridia and archegonia {{on an individual}} bryophyte plant is usually constant within a species, although in some species it may depend <b>on</b> environmental conditions. <b>The</b> main division is between species in which the antheridia and archegonia <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same plant and those in which they <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> different plants. <b>The</b> term monoicous may be used where antheridia and archegonia <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same gametophyte and the term dioicous where they <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> different gametophytes.|$|R

5|$|Another tragedy <b>occurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{morning of}} 16 May 1968 when Ronan Point, a 23-storey tower block in Newham, {{suffered}} a structural collapse {{due to a}} natural gas explosion. Four {{people were killed in}} the disaster and seventeen were injured, as an entire corner of the building slid away. The collapse caused major changes in UK building regulations and led to the decline of further building of high rise council flats that had characterised 1960s public architecture.|$|E
5|$|At that point, the {{previously}} consistent phreatic activity had become intermittent. Between May 10 and May 17, the only change <b>occurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> volcano's north flank, as the bulge increased in size.

5|$|Dry air began {{impacting}} Nadine on September17, though outflow {{from the}} storm prevented significant weakening. Despite a large flare of deep convection over the northern semicircle, Nadine weakened slightly later that day. Further weakening <b>occurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> following day, after the burst in deep convection on September17 deteriorated. Later on September18, most of the deep convection dissipated, with the strongest of the remaining shower and thunderstorm activity being located within a band located west and northwest of the center.|$|E
5|$|During the {{timespan}} of Training Camp {{prior to}} {{the first game of}} the preseason, various transactions <b>occurred.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> first day of camp, rookie Chad Hamilton retired, and on July 31, Tyler Moore was signed to a three-year contract to take his place. On August 5, tight end Brian Vogler was released. Six days later, guard Ryan Groy was traded to the New England Patriots for linebacker Matthew Wells.|$|E
5|$|Flooding {{returned}} {{in the winter}} of early 1890, when the river first rose very quickly and then fell very quickly. Portland's main street was completely submerged, communication over the Cascades was cut off, and many rail lines were forced to shut down. In 1894, another major flood <b>occurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Willamette, and although it too caused huge damage, it was not as large as that of 1861.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to Lee, the police arrested {{a friend of}} Phagan's for the crime. Gradually, the police became convinced that these were not the culprits.
