50|$|Unlike TCP/IP, socket {{numbers are}} part of the full network address in the IDP header, so that upper-layer {{protocols}} do not need to implement demultiplexing; IDP also supplies packet types (again, unlike IP). IDP also contains a checksum covering the entire packet, but it is <b>optional,</b> <b>not</b> <b>mandatory.</b> This reflects the fact that LANs generally have low-error rates, so XNS removed error correction from the lower-level protocols in order to improve performance. Error correction could be optionally added at higher levels in the protocol stack, for instance, in XNS's own SPP protocol. XNS was widely regarded as faster than IP due to this design note.|$|E
50|$|As Agriculture Minister, Uskiw was {{responsible}} for overseeing several initiatives and subsidy programs. He argued that rural taxation was disproportionately high, and favoured shifting education taxes from land to homeownership. He also brought forward legislation to provide for a publicly owned land system to relieve farmers {{of the burden of}} investment (this was an <b>optional,</b> <b>not</b> a <b>mandatory</b> program). Although the NDP made some minor rural gains in the 1973 election, however, the party's core support remained urban. Uskiw himself was easily re-elected in the 1973 election, and in the election of 1977, in which the Schreyer government lost power to the Tories under Sterling Lyon.|$|R
50|$|While {{the player}} still rescues hostages in this version, {{it is now}} an <b>optional</b> task and <b>not</b> <b>mandatory</b> to {{complete}} the game. However, rescuing hostages allows the player to upgrade both their close and long-range weapons, as well as increase their maximum health gauge or restore it. Additionally, rescuing certain hostages is a requirement to access the game's bonus stages, which now occur after the regular stages instead of each boss fight. The ninjutsu skills are now obtained from completing these bonus rounds and the player may hold up to four stocks. The input method of performing these ninja arts is also different as well. The player can use between three different close-range weapons (in addition to the default punches and kicks), four long-range weapons (including an upgrade to the default shurikens), and six ninjutsu spells.|$|R
30|$|Initially, {{electron}} beam-induced object alterations only cause small contrast {{changes in}} images since {{they relate to}} the loss of single atoms from the much stronger contrast of atom columns. Thus, they are hardly recognizable by visual inspection. Only the accumulation of damage can be readily observed. Therefore, a quantitative contrast analysis is <b>not</b> <b>optional</b> but <b>mandatory,</b> if genuine structure of surfaces, defects, or other radiation-sensitive matter, including catalysts is to be interpreted. As a minimum requirement, it should become good practice to list electron doses and rates with every published image. This paper presents detailed examples that highlight the pressing need to address beam-sample interactions in investigations of catalytic nanocrystals using the BF HRTEM mode, where primary beam currents and total doses can be tuned very effectively. The derived conclusions, however, are equally valid for broad beam and focused probe imaging modes and can be converted using the guidelines of Fig.Â  2.|$|R
40|$|In 2003, the WTO General Council {{decided to}} provide an {{additional}} legal pathway for WTO Members with insufficient or no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector to access medicines. Two years later, in 2005, WTO Members unanimously agreed to give this mechanism, {{often referred to as}} the "Paragraph 6 System", a permanent legal status when they adopted the Protocol Amending the TRIPS Agreement. The implementation and use of the additional pro-public health flexibilities provided by the System is <b>optional,</b> <b>not</b> <b>mandatory.</b> To take advantage of them, as of July 2015, 51 WTO Members have adopted specific implementing measures with a variable degree of detail and complexity which incorporate the Paragraph 6 System in their respective legal frameworks and provide the basis for them to act either as exporter or as importers, or as both. This represents almost a third of the WTO Membership, and the predominant bulk of existing pharmaceutical exporters. Given that, unlike other flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement, the Paragraph 6 System was devised as a new mechanism without previous domestic experience to draw upon, there seems to be an exceptional need for an in-depth discussion of how it has been implemented at country level to which this paper attempts to respond. There is, indeed, often limited knowledge in the policy and procurement communities about the wide range of specific measures that have been introduced in many major exporters of medicines and the importance of this information both from a practical point of view, to facilitate exports of needed medicines, and from a policy point of view, to understand the implementation of this novel tool for access to medicines. To contribute to a better understanding of how the System has been implemented in practice, this paper surveys domestic measures that WTO Members have put in place. By doing so, it can inform the broader dialogue about access to medicines and provide practical information for procurement programmes. It can also put a valuable source of information and inspiration at the disposal of those Members who are yet in the process of considering whether and how best to implement the Paragraph 6 System in their domestic legal framework. While the survey illustrates that a robust framework supportive of the export of generic medicines to meet public health needs has been put in place by a significant number of WTO Members, there is an obvious need to move a step forward and engage in a substantive review of the System, including if and how better, more frequent use could be made of it. To conclude, the paper therefore offers some elements for reflection regarding the way forward in order to support the functioning of the Paragraph 6 System...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community at author's request from Dec. 7, 2011 - Dec. 7, 2012 The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the experiences of foster alumni in community and technical colleges, with a focus on Washington State, using a qualitative research approach. Foster alumni may be considered a sub-set of first generation students, yet they have needs that extend beyond those of other first-generation students (e. g., housing). Examination of this issue is timely. Funding designated for foster alumni in higher education has increased in recent years, leading to a variety of support structures and levels of service at the colleges. Yet in the current budget climate, with state support diminishing, the two-year colleges face increasing challenges in providing support not only for foster alumni but for all students. Foster alumni moving into adulthood and through the state colleges represent the quintessential case of in loco parentis, yet their emerging status as adults needs to be supported with appropriate services, not forced dependency. This dissertation consists of three major manuscripts: a summary of the literature and two research reports, one focused on overall findings and the second focused on moving from the findings to considerations for practice. All three manuscripts utilized the critical social science or social justice perspective. The research manuscripts report the findings of a qualitative study using a collective case study design. Two colleges that serve foster alumni were identified and both staff and foster alumni students at the sites were interviewed, for a total of 10 students and 4 staff members. Participant selection utilized both purposive and convenience sampling methods. The study focused on three themes relevant to college participation which were identified based upon the review of the literature: Academic preparedness, psycho-social factors, and meeting basic needs. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim; staff interviews served as both triangulation of the student data as well as a source of additional information on college services to foster alumni. Responses were analyzed for direct responses to interview questions as well as for emerging themes. In addition, case records (e. g., transcripts) were reviewed as an additional method of data triangulation. Findings of the study were reported through individual case summaries in manuscript two as well as cross-case analysis in both manuscripts. While the participants in this study had high rates of high school completion and many had shown signs of "early promise" for academic achievement, all needed pre-college level course remediation in at least one area. A majority of participants indicated having felt depressed, yet only one participant had a diagnosis of depression; most seemed to consider some level of depression to be a natural outcome in their situation. Indications of resilience and internal locus of control were evident. Many continued to struggle to meet basic needs while in college, and eight of the ten student participants reported having experienced periods of homelessness since leaving foster care. Based upon the findings of this study, foster alumni share certain characteristics with other first-generation students, yet their needs in particular areas necessitate additional on-campus services and/or stronger connections with community partners. Considerations for enhancing support services in the community and technical colleges in seven different areas are given, including designating staff contacts, building community partnerships to support housing, arranging for priority registration and financial aid processing to avoid enrollment gaps, and providing <b>optional</b> (<b>not</b> <b>mandatory)</b> mentoring relationships...|$|E
