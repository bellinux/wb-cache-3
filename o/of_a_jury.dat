Critics were unenthusiastic about the film and it earned little at the box office. Vidya then provided the voice of Draupadi for Mahabharat, a 3D animation film based on the Indian epic of the same name.|$|E

40|$|As {{defined by}} the Supreme Court, trial by <b>an</b> {{impartial}} <b>jury</b> <b>of</b> one’s peers is a procedural due process right; however, the Court has frequently been called on to establish its opera-tive parameters. This project evaluates the "simulated impact " of Court decisions which outline an optional reduction in jury size from twelve to below twelve members. The direc-tion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury’s</b> verdict is the most obvious and consequently the most studied of its output (i. e., does <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> find the defendant guilty, not guilty, or is it unable to reach a verdict?). This research evaluates the impact <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury’s</b> size on <b>a</b> surrogate measure <b>of</b> "correctness" &mdash;the accuracy of evidence recall.

Waller unsuccessfully maintained at his trial that the killing had been in self-defense, but was convicted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> of white citizens who had paid the poll tax, a measure that effectively barred blacks and poor whites from jury service.|$|E
25|$|Each {{state may}} {{determine}} the extent to which the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> is used. The use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> is optional for civil trials in any Australian state. The use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> in criminal trials is generally by unanimous verdict of 12 lay members of the public. Some States provide exceptions such as majority (11-to-1 or 10-to-2) verdicts where a jury cannot otherwise reach a verdict. Sometimes a state law may allow an accused person to elect to use a judge-only trial rather than the default jury provision.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{criminal}} court jury arrangement has evolved {{out of the}} medieval juries in England.

25|$|Preliminary {{hearings}} {{in the prosecution}} of 59 men suspected of {{taking part in the}} attack began in October 2007, but the trial was then delayed {{for more than a year}} as court officials sought to find a team of jurors. Between October 2007 and November 2008, an estimated 1,200 citizens were summoned as potential members of the jury. However, more than 500 never appeared in court, and all but 13 of the remainder asked to be excused. In February 2009, the court finally abandoned the idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> trial, deciding it would go ahead with three presiding judges instead.|$|E

25|$|Delaware {{chartered}} corporations {{rely on the}} state's Court of Chancery {{to decide}} legal disputes, which places legal decisions with a judge instead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury.</b> The Court of Chancery, known both nationally and internationally for its speed, competence, and knowledgeable judiciary as a court of equity, is empowered to grant broad relief {{in the form of}} injunctions and restraining orders, which is of particular importance when shareholders seek to block or enjoin corporate actions such as mergers or acquisitions. The Court of Chancery, as a statewide court, may hear cases in any of the state's three counties. A dedicated-use Chancery courthouse was constructed in 2003 in Georgetown, Sussex County. It has hosted high-profile complex corporate trials such as the Disney shareholder litigation.|$|E
25|$|During this process, {{the role}} of the referees is advisory. The {{publisher}} is typically under no obligation to accept the opinions of the referees, though she will most often do so. Furthermore, the referees in scientific publication do not act as a group, do not communicate with each other, and typically are not aware of each other's identities or evaluations. Proponents argue that if the reviewers of a paper are unknown to each other, the publisher can more easily verify the objectivity of the reviews. There is usually no requirement that the referees achieve consensus, with the decision instead often made by the publisher based on her best judgement of the arguments. The group dynamics are thus substantially different from that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury.</b>|$|E

McCaughey wrote op-eds {{over the next six months}} in The Wall Street Journal and USA Today in which she supported the 1993 selection <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> from predominately-white, Republican, rural counties for the urban (Memphis)-located retrial of African American and Democratic US Representative Harold Ford, Sr., and praised the 1993 Shaw v.

25|$|In Irish law, {{women were}} {{forbidden}} to act as witnesses in courts. In Welsh law, women's testimony can be accepted towards other women but not against another man. In France, women's testimony must corroborate with other accounts or would not be accepted. Although women were expected to not attend courts, this however was not always true. Sometimes regardless of expectation, women did participate and attend court cases and court meetings. But women could not act as justices in courts, be attorneys, {{they could not be}} members <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> and they could not accuse another person of a felony unless it's the murder of her husband. For most part, the best thing a woman could do in medieval courts is observe the legal proceedings taking place.|$|E
25|$|Unlike many {{civil law}} countries; which have some courts on which panels of judges with nearly equal status {{composed}} of both legally trained professional judges and lay judges who lack legal training {{and are not}} career judges, the United States legal system (like most Anglo-American legal systems) makes {{a clear distinction between}} professional judges and laypeople involved in deciding a case who are jurors who are part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury.</b> Most but not all US judges have professional credentials as lawyers. Non-lawyer judges in the United States are often elected, and are typically either justices of the peace or part-time judges in rural limited jurisdiction courts. A non-lawyer judge typically has the same rights and responsibilities as a lawyer who is a judge holding the same office and is addressed in the same manner.|$|E
25|$|Another {{distinction}} is the unavailability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> in equity: {{the judge is}} the trier of fact. In the American legal system, the right of jury trial in civil cases tried in federal court is guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment in Suits at common law, cases that traditionally would have been handled by the law courts. The {{question of whether a}} case should be determined by a jury depends largely on the type of relief the plaintiff requests. If a plaintiff requests damages in the form of money or certain other forms of relief, such as the return of a specific item of property, the remedy is considered legal, and a jury is available as the fact-finder. On the other hand, if the plaintiff requests an injunction, declaratory judgment, specific performance, modification of contract, or some other non-monetary relief, the claim would usually be one in equity.|$|E

25|$|Section 43 of the Act {{sought to}} allow cases of serious or complex fraud {{to be tried}} without a jury if a judge was {{satisfied}} that: {{the complexity of the}} trial or the length of the trial (or both) is likely to make the trial so burdensome to the members <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> hearing the trial that the interests of justice require that serious consideration should be given {{to the question of whether}} the trial should be conducted without a jury. However the Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, subsequently sought to repeal the section and to replace it with new provisions under the Fraud (Trials Without a Jury) Bill. In the event, that Bill was defeated and plans to introduce trials without a jury in serious fraud cases were dropped. Section 43 of the Act was repealed on 1 May 2012 by section 113 of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012.|$|E

In 2004, the countries were called in alphabetical order (according to their ISO codes). In 2005, the votes from the non-qualifying semi-finalists were announced first, in their running order on the Thursday night; then the finalists gave their votes in their own order of performance. Between 2006 and 2010, a separate draw was held to determine the order in which countries would present their votes.
