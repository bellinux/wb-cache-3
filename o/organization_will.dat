25|$|The {{home country}} <b>{{organization}}</b> <b>will</b> contact a partner {{organization in the}} country of the student’s choice. Students accepted for the program {{may or may not be}} screened by the organization in their home country. Partner organizations in the destination country each have differing levels of screening they require students to pass through before being accepted into their program. For example, students coming to the U.S. may be allowed to come on the recommendation of the organization in their home country, or the hosting partner may require the student to submit a detailed application, including previous school report cards, letters from teachers and administrators, and standardized English fluency exam papers. The U.S. agency may then accept or decline the applicant. Some organizations also have Rules of Participation. For example, almost all U.S. organizations cannot allow an exchange student to drive an automobile during their visit. Some organizations require a written contract that sets standards for personal behavior and grades, while others may be less rigorous. Lower cost programs can result in a student participating without a supervisor being available nearby to check on the student's well-being. Programs provided by agencies that provide compensation for representatives are more likely to retain local representatives to assist and guide the student and keep track of their well-being.|$|E

We claim that exogenous changes in macro-institutional rules, which result in a move from formal and sequential to informal and simultaneous interaction between collective actors will lead to changes in individual actors’ respective influence over outcomes within organizations. Certain individuals, in particular ‘relais’ actors, controlling information flows between <b>organizations,</b> <b>will</b> see an increase in their power over legislative outcomes. This begs the question of how <b>organizations</b> <b>will</b> respond to these shifts in their internal power balance.
