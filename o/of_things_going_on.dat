500|$|Melua {{opened up}} about the {{breakdown}} years later {{in an interview with}} The Independent, saying that it ended up being {{one of the best things}} that had ever happened to her, as she said it helped to squash a feeling of superiority she felt by being a successful musician in the music industry. [...] "....It was petrifying, but it put a stop to fantasies of being able to do anything. The oddest thing about this job is the sense of superiority you get. It was a huge wake-up call. I was completely out of it for two weeks, and in hospital for six. There was a bunch <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> things at home and crazy work schedules, and you really believe the world revolved around you and it doesn’t." ...|$|E
500|$|Lori Grimes accuses Andrea of {{participating}} {{very little in}} household tasks. Kirkman avouched that since the initiation of the zombie apocalypse, many of the characters have reverted to traditional gender roles; [...] "Lori is really just aggravated over {{a lot of things}} and she's lashing out. She was serious and she wants Andrea to pull her weight; certain people are stuck with certain tasks and to a certain extent people are retreating back into traditional gender roles because of how this survival-crazy world seems to work. Lori has a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> so she's definitely going to be behaving somewhat irrationally at times as she tries to cope with the pregnancy and the conflict between Rick and Shane as well as dealing with the fact that Rick was out on the road again. She's going through a lot of stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{started the}} 1998–99 season in fine form, and claimed his first ever hat-trick in a 3–0 win over Port Vale at Vale Park on 22 August. Despite having {{recently}} signed a long-term contract, his form and goal record led to constant rumours {{of a big}} money move {{to a host of}} Premier League clubs. West Brom eventually issued a [...] "hands-off" [...] warning to other clubs. He claimed further hat-tricks against Crystal Palace and Huddersfield Town, and finished the season with 32 goals in 45 games. This tally left him as the country's top-scorer. He was named on the PFA Team of the Year for the First Division. He then submitted a written transfer request, and his spokesman told the press that there have [...] "been a number <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> behind the scenes which have unsettled him recently". In particular, his £1,400 a week salary was compared with the £5,000 a week salary of under-performing teammate Fabian de Freitas.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} leaked onto the {{internet}} in later October 2009 with several preliminary tracks from Raymond v. Raymond. [...] "Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home)", one of the tracks that follows-up Usher's divorce, and the change in content from Here I Stand, back to Confessions-style, was one of six tracks co-written by Rico Love for the album. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, Love said of Usher's return to that style, [...] "I feel like he’s got his mind right and it’s focused. He went through a lot. He had lost his father when he was creating the Here I Stand record, {{a lot of controversy}} with his marriage, he had kids, he parted ways with his mother’s management, and there were just a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> and he kind of lost focus. It’s not like Here I Stand wasn’t a good album. I just feel like he lost touch with his demographic." [...] According to MTV News, the song provides the reasons behind Usher's crumbling marriage as narrated in [...] "Papers". The remix version featuring Plies made its way onto {{the internet in}} late November, {{a few days before the}} song's radio and digital release.|$|E
500|$|West {{collaborated with}} American film score {{composer}} Jon Brion, {{who served as}} the album's co-executive producer for several tracks. West had been exposed to Brion's work while watching the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, for which Brion had composed music. West was also listening to songs Brion had produced for When the Pawn..., the second studio album of alternative singer-songwriter Fiona Apple, another one of West's favorite musicians and sources of musical inspiration for the album. Although Brion had no prior experience in creating hip-hop records, he and West found that they could productively work together after their first afternoon in the studio where they discovered that neither confined his musical knowledge and vision to one specific genre. When questioned if his presence made Late Registration any less hip-hop, Brion replied, [...] "There are colors and ideas that make [...] different from average hip-hop, but Kanye is already different from the average hip-hop guy. He's got this sense of pop record-making which is really solid, and he likes tracks with a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in them — which is not necessarily common for hip-hop. He was already barking up that tree. This is definitely not just a hip-hop album. But it is also by no means overtly arty, or non-hip-hop. I don't think it's a weird record by any means." ...|$|E
500|$|Ki reached number 26 on the Finnish Top 40 {{and number}} 179 on the French Top 200, and {{appeared}} on the UK Indie and UK Rock charts. It sold 800 copies in its first week of release in the United States, and debuted at number 69 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart. Critical reception of the album was generally positive. Jon Wiederhorn of Revolver said the album is [...] "well worth a listen" [...] and praised the heavier tracks such as [...] "Disruptr" [...] and [...] "Heaven's End", saying, [...] "Townsend mostly contains his rage, but he's at his best when he loses it." [...] Martin Popoff of Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles found the album to have an [...] "odd identity", with [...] "all sorts <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> just under the surface" [...] that rewarded multiple listens. David E. Gehlke of Blistering was less impressed, and found the album inconsistent. Gehlke described [...] "Winter" [...] as [...] "lush and gorgeous", but felt that the album [...] "fails to hit the mark" [...] at other points, such as [...] "Ain't Never Gonna Win" [...] and [...] "Trainfire". Tyler Munro of Sputnikmusic said Ki showed Townsend [...] "at his loosest and most dynamic", and praised Townsend's and Dorval's vocals, but felt the album was held back by musical repetition and its extended guitar jams. Greg Prato of Allmusic gave the album a moderate review, admiring Townsend's unpredictability but feeling the album was not [...] "the most gripping or groundbreaking album" [...] in Townsend's collection. Daniel Cairns of Chronicles of Chaos praised Ki as [...] "a difficult, unusual collection of music" [...] that [...] "also might just be Townsend's best yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think I {{shall have}} to give it a little {{publicity}} too,' said Woodhouse. 'We can't have this kind <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> you know.' His face was set and quite white. Pallant's, on the other hand, was black, and I know that my very stomach had turned with rage. Ollyett was dum.|$|R

6000|$|Lemuel saw her wavering, and {{the wish}} to show 'Manda his {{superior}} power triumphed over every other interest and impulse in him. He got upon his feet. [...] "There is no use in this sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> any longer. I came here because I thought I was wanted. If it's a mistake, it's easy enough to mend it, and it's easy not to make it again. I wish you good evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! I can't tell that. There {{are such}} lots <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> now-a-days that a fellow can {{understand}} nothing about! But I've {{no doubt of}} this--if you were to tie her up with ropes ever so, I don't in the least doubt but what she'd get out." [...] Archie was awe-struck, and made two or three strokes after this but then he plucked up his courage and asked a question--"Where do you suppose they get it from, Doodles?" ...|$|E
60|$|That {{evening after}} the guinea cheque had been despatched, things were further brightened {{by the arrival}} of a letter of atrociously jellygraphed advices from Messrs. Danks and Wimborne. They all {{referred}} to resident vacancies for which Lewisham was manifestly unsuitable, nevertheless their arrival brought an encouraging assurance <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> of shifting and unstable places in the defences of the beleaguered world. Afterwards, with occasional endearments for Ethel, he set himself to a revision of his last year's note-books, for now the botany was finished, the advanced zoological course--the last lap, as it were, for the Forbes medal--was beginning. She got her best hat from the next room to make certain changes in the arrangement of its trimmings. She sat in the little chair, while Lewisham, with documents spread before him, sat at the table.|$|E
60|$|I {{first got}} to know Corky when I came to New York. He was a pal of my cousin Gussie, who was in {{with a lot of}} people down Washington Square way. I don't know if I ever told you about it, but the reason why I left England was because I was sent over by my Aunt Agatha to try to stop young Gussie marrying a girl on the {{vaudeville}} stage, and I got the whole thing so mixed up that I decided that it would be a sound scheme for me to stop on in America for a bit instead of going back and having long cosy chats about the thing with aunt. So I sent Jeeves out to find a decent apartment, and settled down for a bit of exile. I'm bound to say that New York's a topping place to be exiled in. Everybody was awfully good to me, and there seemed to be plenty <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> and I'm a wealthy bird, so everything was fine. Chappies introduced me to other chappies, and so on and so forth, and it wasn't long before I knew squads of the right sort, some who rolled in dollars in houses up by the Park, and others who lived with the gas turned down mostly around Washington Square--artists and writers and so forth. Brainy coves.|$|E
60|$|He sang {{this time}} as if nobody loved him. As a song, {{it was not a}} very pathetic song, being all about coons {{spooning}} in June under the moon, {{and so on and so}} forth, but Gussie handled it in such a sad, crushed way that there was genuine anguish in every line. By the time he reached the refrain I was nearly in tears. It seemed such a rotten sort of world with all that kind <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in it.|$|R

5000|$|Milne {{was said}} to be small in stature with a {{drooping}} head and his eyes continuously focused on the ground and apparently heedless <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> around him.

60|$|From {{where he}} stood, outside the barrier which {{separated}} {{visitors to the}} office from the workers within, Jimmy could see a vista of efficient-looking young men with paper protectors round their cuffs working away at mysterious jobs which seemed to involve {{the use of a}} great deal of paper. One in particular was so surrounded by it that he had the appearance of a bather in surf. Jimmy eyed these toilers with a comfortable and kindly eye. All this industry made him feel happy. He liked to think of this sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> all round him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Drugs {{take the}} place of {{wholesome}} wine," [...] he went on, warming to his subject. [...] "The hideous fascination of flirting with the uncouth or the impossible some way or another, stimulates a passion which simple means have ceased to gratify. You seek for the unusual in every way--in food, in the substitution of absinthe for your harmless Martini, of cocaine for your stimulating champagne. There is a horrible wave of all this sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> to-day in many places, and I am afraid," [...] he concluded, [...] "that a great many of our very nicest young women are caught up in it." ...|$|R

She had her own reputation to think about, {{and one or two}} of her predecessors--God rest the ashes of those fires!--had not been so discreet. Yet one could not have this sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> behind Edith's back.

6000|$|Looking back, I may say that, {{so far as}} I {{was mixed}} up in it, the thing began at seven o'clock in the morning, when I was aroused from a dreamless sleep by the dickens of a scrap in {{progress}} outside my state-room door. The chief ingredients were a female voice that sobbed and said: [...] "Oh, Harold!" [...] and a male voice [...] "raised in anger," [...] as they say, which after considerable difficulty, I identified as Voules's. I hardly recognized it. In his official capacity Voules talks exactly like you'd expect a statue to talk, if it could.

The Los Angeles Times, in naming Bleu one of the [...] "Faces to Watch" [...] in 2007, remarked upon:a new brand of teen-pop for Disney — a wholesome, natural, R&B-flavored reaction to the synthetic era of Britney and the Backstreet Boys.
