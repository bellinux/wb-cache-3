We're kind of doing it some of it tongue-in-cheek, so it's hard to miss the actual point. are making it kind of in a humorous light and some of it's more serious, but really the main overtone <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> is whenever there's an obstacle between the guy and {{a girl in a}} relationship, what happens when that's taken away." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ron Goldstein, {{president}} of Private Music, agreed {{with such a}} standpoint, and explained that [...] "Windham Hill was the hub <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing.</b> Because of that association, New-age {{has come to be}} perceived as this West Coast thing". However, the label managing director Sam Sutherland, argued that even founders of Windham Hill, William Ackerman and Anne Robinson, [...] "shied away from using any idiomatic or generic term at all. It's always seemed a little synthetic", and as a company they stopped making any kind of deliberate protests {{to the use of the}} term simply because it was inappropriate. Both Goldstein and Sutherland concluded that the tag has helped move merchandise, and that new-age music will be absorbed into the general body of pop music within a few years from 1987.|$|E
5000|$|Presented as a thinktank, American International Center {{was headed}} by Scanlon's {{childhood}} friends, Brian Mann, a yoga instructor, and David Grosh, a lifeguard on the Delaware shore who operated {{it from his}} beach house. Grosh had no qualifications or experience relevant to policy research and currently works in construction. At a Senate hearing into the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal, Mann refused to answer questions, but Grosh {{admitted that he had}} abetted the deception. In a prepared statement that opened his testimony, he said [...] ""I'm embarrassed and disgusted to be a part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing.</b> The Lakota Indians have a word, Wasi'chu, which aptly describes all of us right now." [...] The Center paid for the rent of the beach house and gave Grosh at most $2500 and some ice hockey tickets.|$|E

5000|$|It {{was around}} 95, I was heavily into the <b>whole</b> battling <b>thing,</b> {{working on the}} tables constantly, {{mastering}} new techniques and scratches...I made this mixtape called [...] "Comprehension," [...] and on there was a track called [...] "Turntablism" [...] which featured Melo-D and D-Styles. And <b>this</b> is part <b>of</b> where <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> about turntablist came from. This was a time where all these new techniques were coming out, like flares and stuff, and there were probably 20 people or so, in around California between Frisco and LA, who knew about these. So we worked on them, talked about it and kicked about the ideas that these techniques and new ways of scratching gave us.|$|R

50|$|Another concept about HIV/AIDS {{throughout}} {{the novel is}} the ignorance of HIV/AIDS by American society. When the epidemic started out as Gay-related immune deficiency (GRID) in the late 70s, early 80s, the disease only infected homosexual men. As we read further into the book, criticisms and notes on HIV/AIDS in popular culture become more prevalent. There is a certain section of the book, almost {{right in the middle}} where there is a mock Walton scene. At first the narrator says “I love you to all” of these characters, who presumably already died. Then he goes on to talk about a movie called Longtime Companion, that he believes was a joke, and “could have been called The Waltons Do AIDS” (114). The movie {{is said to have been}} unrealistic and it appears that all the characters sort of died off one by one. Another movie referenced in this montage is Philadelphia (film), which has a bad reception as well. At the end of this scene the narrator says, “Ask the reader. They have an objective view <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing.</b> Okay. Hey you! Hey you! Do you think this is enough?” (114). The anger within the voice of the character radiates off the page. Perhaps it is to ask the reader if the pop culture reaction to HIV/AIDS has been significant, or if it has been ignored. Due to the constant cultural references in the book when HIV/AIDS is presented it is obvious that HIV/AIDS was and has been ignored by the “majority” for a while.|$|E

[...] "It all started when Rick Rubin encouraged us, a couple of years before, to revisit some of our earlier records," [...] he told Kerrang! founder Geoff Barton in 2010. [...] "Last year, we sat down and took stock of all the good fortune and good times we'd enjoyed. And we basically – as you know, because you were invited – tried to put 200 {{of the people who were}} primarily responsible for us being inducted into the Hall of Fame in one room, in one place, for a couple of days. We got most of them over to Cleveland, where the ceremony was held, and it was a great trip down memory lane.

Slezak gave it an [...] "A" [...] and wrote, [...] "this spirited rendition captured [...] jaunty essence", and Strecker noted with her [...] "B+" [...] that [...] "this was the moment when it really kicked in that the show {{will never be the}} same". Chaney also complimented Finn for having gotten [...] "the hang <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> singing-and-dancing <b>thing</b> in the last three episodes <b>of</b> <b>this</b> season" [...] and gave a grade of [...] "B".

500|$|Describing {{the various}} songs on Bleach, Christopher Sandford wrote: [...] "'Paper Cuts' {{includes}} a folk-influence melody and ponderous rhythm {{of an early}} Led Zeppelin number; 'Mr. Moustache' addressed itself to Nirvana's male fans; 'Downer' showed the same exceptional contempt for the group's audience". Sandford felt [...] "School" [...] – which features only four lines of lyrics – was memorable for its chorus that [...] "served as the rip". While [...] "Scoff" [...] is [...] "a parting salvo at [...] ", [...] "Negative Creep" [...] was written by Cobain about himself. According to Sandford, [...] "About a Girl" [...] has a [...] "chiming melody and ironic chorus". In Sounds magazine, Keith Cameron said the song [...] "was exhilarating and it was exciting {{because that was the}} nature of the music, but there was also an almost palpable sense <b>of</b> danger, that <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> could fall apart any second. There was never any relaxation from the first note to the last". In his book Nirvana: The Stories Behind Every Song, Chuck Crisafulli writes that the song [...] "stands out in the Cobain canon as a song with a very specific genesis and a very real subject".|$|R
60|$|As Jimmy sat {{smoking a}} last {{cigarette}} {{in his bedroom}} {{before going to bed}} that night, Spike Mullins came in. Jimmy had been thinking things over. He was one of those men who are at their best in a losing game. Imminent disaster always had the effect of keying him up and putting an edge on his mind. The news he had heard that night had left him with undiminished determination, but conscious that a change of method would be needed. He must stake all on a single throw now. Young Lochinvar rather than Romeo must be his model. He declined to believe himself incapable of getting anything that he wanted as badly as he wanted Molly. He also declined to believe that she was really attached to Lord Dreever. He suspected the hand of McEachern in the affair, though the suspicion did not clear up the mystery by any means. Molly was a girl of character, not a feminine counterpart of his lordship, content meekly to do what she was told in a matter <b>of</b> <b>this</b> kind. The <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> puzzled him.|$|R

60|$|For that service, for all service, {{whether of}} revenue, trade, or empire, my trust {{is in her}} {{interest}} in the British Constitution. My hold of the colonies is in the close affection which grows from common names, from kindred blood, from similar privileges, and equal protection. These are ties which, though light as air, are as strong as links of iron. Let the colonies always keep the idea of their civil rights associated with your government,--they will cling and grapple to you, and no force under heaven will be of power to tear them from their allegiance. But let it be once understood that your government may be one thing and their privileges another, that these two things may exist without any mutual relation,--the cement is gone, the cohesion is loosened, and everything hastens to decay and dissolution. As {{long as you have}} the wisdom to keep the sovereign authority <b>of</b> <b>this</b> country as the sanctuary of liberty, the sacred temple consecrated to our common faith, wherever the chosen race and sons of England worship freedom, they will turn their faces towards you. The more they multiply, the more friends you will have; the more ardently they love liberty, the more perfect will be their obedience. Slavery they can have anywhere. It is a weed that grows in every soil. They may have it from Spain, they may have it from Prussia. But, until you become lost to all feeling of your true interest and your natural dignity, freedom they can have from none but you. This is the commodity of price, of which you have the monopoly. This is the true Act of Navigation, which binds to you the commerce of the colonies, and through them secures to you the wealth of the world. Deny them <b>this</b> participation <b>of</b> freedom, and you break that sole bond which originally made, and must still preserve, the unity of the empire. Do not entertain so weak an imagination as that your registers and your bonds, your affidavits and your sufferances, your cockets and your clearances, are what form the great securities of your commerce. Do not dream that your letters of office, and your instructions, and your suspending clauses are the things that hold together the great contexture <b>of</b> <b>this</b> mysterious <b>whole.</b> These <b>things</b> do not make your government. Dead instruments, passive tools as they are, it is the spirit of the English communion that gives all their life and efficacy to them. It is the spirit of the English Constitution, which, infused through the mighty mass, pervades, feeds, unites, invigorates, vivifies every part of the empire, even down to the minutest member.|$|R
