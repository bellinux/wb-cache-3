2500|$|A report {{released}} in December 2013 by the United States Department of Energy further describes {{the potential benefits}} of energy storage and demand side technologies to the electric grid: “Modernizing the electric system will help the nation meet the challenge of handling projected energy needs—including addressing climate change by integrating more energy from renewable sources and enhancing efficiency from non-renewable energy processes. Advances to the electric grid must maintain a robust and resilient electricity delivery system, and energy storage can {{play a significant role in}} meeting these challenges by improving the operating capabilities of the grid, lowering cost and ensuring high reliability, as well as deferring and reducing infrastructure investments. Finally, energy storage can be instrumental for emergency preparedness because of its ability to provide backup power as well as grid stabilization services.” [...] The report was written by a core group <b>of</b> developers representing <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Electricity <b>Delivery</b> and Energy Reliability, ARPA-E, <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Science, <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Sandia National Laboratories, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; all of whom are engaged in the development of grid energy storage.|$|R
