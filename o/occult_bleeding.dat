40|$|Background: Little data {{exist on}} the yield of {{colonoscopy}} in its different indications, especially gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Furthermore, there are no formal guidelines regarding the timing of its performance in the work up for lower GI bleeding. Methods: In a retrospective study, spanning from January 2007 to December 2013, the clinical data of all the patients undergoing colonoscopy were retrieved from the hospital records including the predominant symptom which mandated colonoscopy and results of the other tests done before colonoscopy including upper GI endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy [EGD]). The type of GI <b>bleed</b> (overt or <b>occult)</b> along with {{the presence or absence}} of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) was noted. The yield of EGD in the corresponding years in those having a presentation with lower GI bleed and/or IDA was also noted for comparison. Results: Overall yield of colonoscopy was low (25. 7 %) like for all its indications except lower GI bleed where its yield was highest (45. 2 %). 81. 2 % of the cases with a diagnosis presented with lower GI bleed, highest for colon cancer (90 %), and polyps (86. 1 %). Cases of <b>occult</b> <b>bleed</b> more often had a positive diagnosis than overt bleed (P = 0. 02). EGD yielded positive findings in more cases (43. 2 %, P = 0. 00) than colonoscopy (except piles). Colonic cancers and polyps were presented with hematochezia when compared to gastric cancer which presented more often with <b>occult</b> <b>bleed</b> and other clinical symptoms. Conclusion: EGD should be done first in lower GI bleeding to exclude upper GI source and select subsequent colonoscopy. For hematochezia and <b>occult</b> <b>bleed,</b> colonoscopy is important whether IDA is present or not...|$|R

50|$|Capsule {{endoscopy}} is used {{to examine}} parts of the gastrointestinal tract that cannot be seen {{with other types of}} endoscopy. Upper endoscopy, also called EGD, uses a camera attached to a long flexible tube to view the esophagus, the stomach {{and the beginning of the}} first part of the small intestine called the duodenum. A colonoscope, inserted through the rectum, can view the colon and the distal portion of the small intestine, the terminal ileum. These two types of endoscopy cannot visualize the majority of the middle portion of the gastrointestinal tract, the small intestine. Capsule endoscopy is useful when disease is suspected in the small intestine, and can sometimes diagnose sources of <b>occult</b> <b>bleeding</b> visible microscopically only or causes of abdominal pain such as Crohn's disease, or peptic ulcers. Capsule endoscopy can be used to diagnose problems in the small intestine, but unlike EGD or colonoscopy it cannot treat pathology that may be discovered. Capsule endoscopy transfers the captured images wirelessly to an external receiver worn by the patient using one of appropriate frequency bands. The collected images are then transferred to a computer for diagnosis, review and display. A transmitted radio-frequency signal can be used to accurately estimate the location of the capsule and to track it in real time inside the body and gastrointestinal tract.|$|E

40|$|Background: Capsule {{endoscopy}} (CE) {{is a new}} {{diagnostic tool}} {{for the study of}} patients with suspected small bowel pathology. The aim {{of the study was to}} clarify the usefulness of CE in the group of patients with obscure (overt / occult) gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Patients and methods: Thirty patients (14 men, 16 women, mean age 50 years, range 9 - 79 years) were enrolled in the study. All of them undergone non-diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy and barium follow-through of the small bowel. All patients underwent capsule endoscopy. Fourteen patients had overt and sixteen <b>occult</b> <b>bleeding.</b> The single senior endoscopist interpreted CE findings in an unblended manner. Results: CE identified a source of bleeding in 14 / 30 patients (46, 6 %). Lesions identified were: tumors in five pts, vascular lesions, Crohn's disease and Meckel's diverticulum in two pts and fresh bleeding, segmental celiac disease and colonic diverticulosis in one patient each. CE identified a source of bleeding in 9 / 14 (64, 3 %) of patients with ongoing overt bleeding and in only 5 / 16 (31, 3 %) of patients with <b>occult</b> <b>bleeding.</b> The positive suspicious findings were seen in 6 / 30 (20 %) of patients (2 / 14 with overt bleeding and 4 / 16 with <b>occult</b> <b>bleeding.</b> In 3 / 14 (21, 4 %) with overt and 7 / 16 (43, 7 %) with <b>occult</b> <b>bleeding</b> findings on CE were negative. All patients with negative findings on follow-up remained asymptomatic for one year. Capsule retention because of unsuspected stenosis occurred in a single patient and required surgery, which resolved the problem. Conclusion: CE is an effective diagnostic tool for patients with obscure GI bleeding. It is safe and painless technique which can diagnose the bleeding site beyond the reach of conventional endoscopy. The best candidates for the procedure are those with ongoing and overt bleeding...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Jejunal diverticulosis is an {{uncommon}} disease and usually asymptomatic. It can be complicated {{not only by}} diverticulitis, but by hemorrhage, perforation, intussusception, volvulus, malabsorption and even small bowel obstruction due to enteroliths formed and expelled from these diverticula. Methods We describe a case of an <b>occult</b> <b>bleeding</b> jejunal diverticulum, casually discovered in a patient that was taken to surgery for a Dieulafoyâ€™s lesion after unsuccessful endoscopic treatment. We performed a gastric resection together with an ileocecal resection. Macroscopic and microscopic examinations confirmed the gastric Dieulafoyâ€™s lesion and demonstrated the presence of another source of <b>occult</b> <b>bleeding</b> in asymptomatic jejunal diverticulum. Discussion The current case emphasizes that some gastrointestinal bleeding lesions, although rare, can be multiple and result in potentially life-threatening bleeding. The clinician must be mindful {{to the possibility of}} multisite lesions and to the correlation between results of the investigations and clinical condition of the bleeding patient. </p...|$|E

40|$|A 50 -year-old man {{awaiting}} liver transplantation {{for primary}} sclerosing cholangitis developed iron-deficiency anaemia. Repeated <b>occult</b> gastrointestinal <b>bleeding</b> {{led to an}} increasing need for blood transfusions. After multiple oesophagogastroduodenoscopies and colonoscopies, videocapsule endoscopy finally demonstrated a polyp-like lesion in the terminal ileum. The lesion had not been detected despite two attempts (oral and anal) at double-balloon enteroscopy and even a peroperative enteroscopy. Only during a second laparotomy, again involving peroperative enteroscopy, a small red lesion was detected and resected 80 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve (Bauhin's valve). Histology revealed a Dieulafoy lesion. Four months later, after normalisation and stabilisation of his haemoglobin level, the patient received a successful liver transplant. If the cause of <b>occult</b> gastrointestinal <b>bleeding</b> in a patient remains unclear despite regular endoscopic procedures, new techniques like videocapsule endoscopy and double-balloon enteroscopy may contribute to identifying the cause.

40|$|Objectives: <b>Occult</b> {{gastrointestinal}} <b>bleeding</b> can {{originate from}} the foregut, midgut, or hindgut. The {{evaluation of the}} foregut and hindgut are well established. Cases that involve bleeding from the midgut present a much more significant challenge in terms of detection and treatment. Methods of evaluation include small bowel endoscopy, arteriography, and gastrointestinal contrast studies. The differential diagnosis includes arteriovenous malformations, angiodysplasia, ulcers, and small bowel tumors. We will demonstrate that both the evaluation and treatment of these lesions may be accomplished using minimally invasive techniques. Methods: A case of <b>occult</b> gastrointestinal <b>bleeding</b> from a polypoid hemangioma located in the distal jejunum is presented.

40|$|Abstract. Stool {{specimens}} of 104 primary schoolchildren (mean 6 SD age 5 8. 2 6 0. 3 years) were examined for helminth eggs and for occult blood {{to investigate the}} possibility that trichuriasis causes <b>occult</b> intestinal <b>bleeding</b> {{in the absence of}} the overt Trichuris dysentery syndrome. A commercially available guaiac test was used to detect fecal occult blood. Sixty-one children had Trichuris infection, 11 of whom had heavy infections (. 10, 000 eggs per gram of feces [epg]), and 53 had Ascaris infections. No hookworm infection was detected. Baseline screening yielded only one weakly positive occult blood test result in a child with a light (800 epg) Trichuris infection. Serial stool occult blood testing on the 11 subjects with heavy trichuriasis and 8 uninfected controls yielded a single weakly positive result in the control group. The results provide no evidence that trichuriasis predisposes to significant <b>occult</b> gastrointestinal <b>bleeding</b> in children {{in the absence of the}} dysenteric syndrome.
