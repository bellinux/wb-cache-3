[...] "The challenge with that voice {{was to try to}} evolve it into something that had not been heard before," [...] says Bender. [...] "We did a lot of research into the voices that had been used for past Hollywood movies as well as for radio shows, and we were trying to create something that had never been previously heard not only from a casting standpoint but from a voice manipulation standpoint as well. The solution was to use the voice of actor Val Kilmer to suggest the kind of voice we hear inside our own heads in <b>our</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>lives,</b> as opposed to the larger than life tones with which God has been endowed in prior cinematic incarnations." ...|$|E
500|$|In Gender Advertisements, {{he writes}} about how gender is {{represented}} in the advertising we all absorb in <b>our</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>lives.</b> [...] He explains relative size, feminine touch, function ranking, the family, the ritualization of subordination, and licensed withdraw. [...] Relative size means that the women represented in advertisements are generally shown shorter or smaller in comparison to men. [...] Feminine touch is when a woman touches a man or an object {{in a way that}} is very loose, and not gripping the object tightly. [...] Function ranking represents a hierarchy in the images, by way that the man is shown in front and largest in front of women and children. [...] The family is typically depicted in a way that gives the father and a son a close relationship, and the mother and a daughter a close relationship. [...] The ritualization of subordination is when women are shown in a lower ranking or worth of an image, and they are smaller, underneath, and overall of lesser importance to men. [...] Finally, licensed withdrawal is when a women is shown as not interested in the camera, or looking off into the distance with head and body cant. Goffman analyzes all of these topics in a very in-depth and easy to understand format.|$|E

2500|$|The DR {{forms an}} {{important}} part of Giddens’s recent preoccupation with the emergence of the high opportunity, high risk society. [...] For example, the advent of the DR promises fundamental advances in core areas of medicine. New threats and problems abound, both in <b>our</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>lives</b> and in the larger institutions of our societies. Scientists can communicate with one-another in a direct way across the world. The overlap of supercomputers and genetics means that genetic structures can be decoded instantaneously, promising huge advances in conquering major diseases. Medical practice is likely to be transformed through remote monitoring and other digital innovations. Yet the overlap of the DR with criminality, violence and war is pervasive and dangerous. Military drones are just one example of the continuing involvement of the DR with war.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{technological}} progress {{within the last}} few years allows the construction of robots that could be part of <b>our</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>live</b> in near future. Besides human like appearance and communication they require natural patterns of behavior and motion to achieve wide acceptance. To analyze human motions we present different kinds of motion capturing systems and post-processing methods for motion data. Further on, we describe principles for the extraction of suitable motion features, especially on the basis of Wavelet Transforms. These features allow the distinction of inter and intra-individual characteristics. Finally, we discuss the design and the application of Hidden Markov Models towards the classification of motion types and the recognition of motion phases. All methods and results are demonstrated by examples of walking and object manipulation motions of different persons and manners. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Mobile {{interactions}} with the physical world, meaning a person uses her mobile device as mediator for the interaction with a physical object, {{get more and more}} popular in industry and academia. Typical technologies supporting this kind of interactions are Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), visual marker recognition, Near Field Communication (NFC), or Bluetooth. Currently, there only exists very little tool support for building systems that consider this kind of interactions. But this is necessary because of the complexity, variety and distribution of such systems. A framework would also support the development and the dissemination of physical mobile interactions in <b>our</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>live.</b> Therefore we present in this paper the requirements for such tool support, the architecture of the Physical Mobile Interaction Framework (PMIF) and a first version of the implementation. Key words: Physical mobile interaction framework, physical mobile interaction, mobile device...|$|R

2500|$|Trouble {{was much}} more themed on Christianity than their debut, {{although}} its nature was philosophical rather than spiritual. Characterized by James Carter, [...] "The last album, we wrote about <b>our</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>lives...</b> {{the majority of the}} songs were about skateboarding and stories we made up. This album, pretty much every song is about Christianity." [...] The band leveled criticism at the church and Christians generally, sometimes using sarcasm, reminding one reviewer of Steve Taylor. [...] "Tip from Me" [...] is about breaking broad perceptions of Christianity and the Church. The purpose of the song was to acknowledge problems with the church, say to the non-Christian that [...] "Yeah, we see the problems too," [...] and a call to the Christian to act to fix them. In the song [...] "Stupid" [...] the band used the example of abortion clinic bombings (see, for example Eric Robert Rudolph) to make a pronounced statement about hypocrisy.|$|E
2500|$|The House of Lords (Lord Porter, Lord Normand, Lord Oaksey, Lord Reid and Lord Radcliffe) {{unanimously}} {{found that}} there was no negligence, although most considered it a close call based on whether the reasonable person would foresee this as anything more than an extremely remote risk. [...] Most of the Lords agreed that the key issue was that of making the key question one of determining the fact of what the reasonable person would have in mind regarding assumption of this risk. [...] Facts may be determined by judges, but may also be determined by lesser mortals in juries. [...] This was not considered to be a point of law, which is the province of judges. [...] In this case the risk was considered (just) too remote for the reasonable person, in spite of the observation by Lord Porter that hitting a ball out of the ground was an objective of the game, [...] "and indeed, one which the batsman would wish to bring about". The Lords believed there were policy implications in terms of the message of what liability would have meant in creating restrictions in what we can do in <b>our</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>lives</b> in an urbanised modern society.|$|E
40|$|Meanwhile sensors are a {{vital part}} of <b>our</b> <b>everyday’s</b> <b>lives.</b> But {{due to the lack of}} {{standardizing}} their measurement output, its information can often not be fully leveraged.

The main contribution includes a prototype embedded device system architecture for federal organized sensor networks, software components (embedded web-services) serving standardized near real-time sensor information as well as connector components for GI-software to interface and analyze this information based on open standards. The mobile prototype infrastructure, which has been practically proven in several smaller research projects, will be fully implemented on a large scale case study in Bavaria including tests utilizing the GALILEO positioning signal and a project together with MIT...|$|R

The pupil reacts {{to a change in}} perceived brightness and does so earlier as an actual behavioral report. The pupil is an indicator for upcoming rivalry shifts. Under normal viewing condition the visual system is provided by many different depth cues, as disparity and perspective. A combination of cues, indicting for the same or different spatial orientation, revealed, that cues are used to estimated depth; without regard to a potential antagonism. The visual system is flooded by information. In order to separate relevant and irrelevant data, attention is employed.

40|$|Spatio-temporal {{databases}} are {{representations of}} four-dimensional spatio-temporal reality. We discuss three different perspectives onto this reality: (a) the `god's eye' perspective in which spatiotemporal objects {{are seen as}} four-dimensional and non-changing, (b) {{the perspective of a}} sweeping plane dissecting four-dimensional reality into three-dimensional slices which we humans perceive the current moment; and (c) the perspective `from within', which explicitly takes the existence of the change, events and processes we humans experience in <b>our</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>live.</b> We show that these different views have correponding spatio-temporal data models and query languages that are used to represent reality seen from the particular perspective. We argue that a spatio-temporal database system needs to be capable to switch between different views onto reality and consequently needs to provide transformations between the corresponding datastructures. We show that (a) and (b) are important for the storage of data and that (c), the view `from within', is particularly important for human interactions with spatio-temporal databases, i. e., the way queries are posed to the system and the way the user expects the system to respond. ...|$|R

40|$|Video {{surveillance}} became omnipresent in <b>our</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>live</b> and is {{a lively}} field of research. While early research was focused on functionality, e. g., face recognition or violence detection, nowadays also privacy and transparency related work is done. While this research helps us to design systems that combine functionality and privacy, only little understanding is present how the people under video surveillance will react to the new systems. The average citizen does not understand technological details and is unable to distinguish between systems with varying privacy protection. Overall, surveillance has a bad reputation in most countries. To understand the acceptance of surveillance within a society, many questionnaires were made to ask people, if they support it in special places, e. g., airports, public transport and shopping malls, which led to many statistics about surveillance. Their outcome depends on recently happened events, e. g., a terrorists attack or a reported misuse of a video sequence. The underlying factors are not considered and no generic model for the acceptance exists. This work presents a model, based on the well known Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). It is shown, which factors lead to a personal level of acceptance. The results {{presented in this paper}} can be used to design accepted and efficient surveillance systems...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{political}} {{demands for}} a more intensive development of the subject of remote sensing in school lessons, it still plays an inferior role. It appears {{that many of the}} software solutions created explicitly for school lessons have not been introduced to school curricula due to their complexity. As a result, the subject is either not integrated in lessons at all or, at best, does not go beyond the level of analogue image interpretation. Yet because remote sensing represents more than just the visual interpretation of satellite images, it also requires the facilitation of basic maths and physics, as well as methodological and media competence. For the sustainable integration of remote sensing as a school subject, this paper therefore presents digital, interactive and interdisciplinary learning modules which can promote the methodological and media competence of pupils, as well as their independent study skills. 1. INTRODUCATION As part of the aerospace industry, remote sensing represents a key technology in our modern-day information society and is attached with an increasing degree of economic relevance. Among other things, this is reflected in the continual development of new sensors such as TerraSAR-X and RapidEye, and in the growing need for qualified employees. In addition, satellite images are affecting <b>our</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>live...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper interrogates the {{question}} 'where are you from?' by drawing on our experiences and {{points of view}} as visibly different African migrants who get asked this 'quintessential question of identity' almost on a daily basis. While acknowledging that a certain 'curiosity‘ sometimes drives the asking of this question, we still question the implications and multiplicity of meanings to those whom it is asked. We contend that being asked {{the question}} raises three key issues for us. First, we perceive it as exclusionary, in that in a white dominated society it is asked, mainly of certain groups {{of people who are}} visibly different. Second, the assumption behind the question - that one is not 'from here', constructs an/other whose identity is fixed and tied only to one faraway place, thereby erasing our hyphenated identities, which define <b>our</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>lived</b> realities. Third, it invokes feelings of ambivalence about place when it is interpreted as demanding a justification of the claim to belonging and being 'from here‘. Our paper shows that the question is a matter of identity politics and exposes the complexity of identity work that occurs whenever this question is asked of us. In so doing, it highlights the contradiction between our Australian 'selves‘ and migrant 'other‘...|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, I examine {{contemporary}} Chicana and Chicano {{narratives that}} promote, complicate, and contest {{the ideology of}} the American Dream and its relationship to the U. S. educational system. I argue that these narratives expose the contradictory nature of an ideology that claims that education is the key to upward mobility for young children of all backgrounds, even as U. S. educational institutions are unequal. I suggest that those works that characterize the United States as a meritocracy and blame individual people and their cultures for their academic underachievement uphold the hegemonic ideology of the American Dream, as well as the master narrative that ignores the histories, experiences, and epistemologies of Chicanas/os and other people of color. Other Chicana/o narratives, however, problematize the contradictions in {{the ideology of the}} American Dream by exposing the sociostructural problems that make the American Dream inaccessible by those in the margins. Although educational institutions are critical sites in which an ideology of the American Dream is perpetuated and maintained, schools can also have a dialectical function that allows Chicanas and Chicanos to imagine an American Dream that includes the diversity in their realities; issues of bilingualism, assimilation, acculturation, gender education, and citizenship figure in the narratives I analyze in this project. I argue that the study of these works is critical because narrative allows us to confront the contradictory nature of the ideology of the American Dream, a powerful contradiction that often remains invisible or unchallenged in <b>our</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>live...</b>|$|R
