5|$|After DNA {{replication}} is complete, {{the cell}} must physically {{separate the two}} copies of the genome and divide into two distinct membrane-bound cells. In prokaryotes(bacteria and archaea) this usually occurs via a relatively simple process called binary fission, in which each circular genome attaches to the cell membrane and is separated into the daughter cells as the membrane invaginates to split the cytoplasm into two membrane-bound portions. Binary fission is extremely fast compared to the rates of cell division in eukaryotes. Eukaryotic cell division is a more complex process known as the cell cycle; DNA replication <b>occurs</b> <b>during</b> a phase of this cycle known as S phase, whereas the process of segregating chromosomes and splitting the cytoplasm <b>occurs</b> <b>during</b> M phase.|$|E

30|$|Figure 6 b {{shows the}} {{coagulation}} of Ag nanoparticles, which was likely {{a result of}} three potential processes. First, agglomeration may have <b>occurred</b> <b>during</b> handling or processing due to the high specific surface area of the nanoparticles. Second, it may have <b>occurred</b> <b>during</b> the drying process of sample preparation. Finally, it may have <b>occurred</b> <b>during</b> condensation.|$|R
30|$|The {{incipient}} droughts that <b>occurred</b> <b>during</b> the wintering {{period of}} the winter wheat growth helped to increase the winter wheat yield, while the mild droughts that <b>occurred</b> <b>during</b> the maturity stage of winter wheat resulted in a reduction of yield. The mild droughts that <b>occurred</b> <b>during</b> the filling and maturity period {{had a significant effect}} on the yield of winter wheat. The moderate droughts that <b>occurred</b> <b>during</b> the flowering, filling, and maturity periods of the winter wheat growth {{had a significant impact on}} yield. In addition, the water shortage due to droughts that <b>occurred</b> <b>during</b> the seeding period in autumn also affected the production of winter wheat, and that is particularly true for the severe and extreme droughts that <b>occurred</b> <b>during</b> the seeding period. With some exception of the occurrence of droughts of certain intensities during some specific growth stages of winter wheat, droughts of higher intensities had greater impacts on winter wheat yield during the critical growth stages.|$|R

5|$|The {{absorption}} band of simple cations shift toward shorter wavelength {{when they are}} involved in more covalent interactions. This <b>occurs</b> <b>during</b> hydration of metal ions, so colourless anhydrous ionic compounds with an anion absorbing in the infrared can become colourful in solution.|$|E
5|$|Troponin I, slow {{skeletal}} muscle is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TNNI1 gene.

5|$|Workers form {{foraging}} {{columns in}} search of food. They forage into buildings, eucalyptus trees, ground areas or on low vegetation.

5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in 2006 identified 216 {{species of birds}} known to have occurred in Petrified Forest National Park since the park became a protected area in 1906. Of those, 33 species breed within the park, 6 other species probably do, and 18 species live in the park year-round. Thirty-five species live in the park only {{during the summer and}} 11 species only during the winter. The greatest diversity of birds <b>occurs</b> <b>during</b> fall and winter migrations.|$|E
5|$|An {{exception}} to this rule <b>occurs</b> <b>during</b> medal presentation ceremonies at multi-sport {{events such as the}} Olympics and Asian Games. As Hong Kong competes separately from mainland China, should an athlete from Hong Kong win the gold medal, and an athlete from mainland China win the silver and/or bronze medal(s) in the same event, the regional flag of Hong Kong would be raised in the centre above the national flag(s) during the medal presentation ceremony.|$|E

25|$|The novel, {{written in}} chronological order, {{is divided into}} sixty chapters.

5|$|Aphthous-like {{ulceration}} also {{occurs in}} conditions involving systemic immuno-dysregulation, e.g. cyclic neutropenia and {{human immunodeficiency virus}} infection. In cyclic neutropenia, more severe oral ulceration <b>occurs</b> <b>during</b> periods of severe immuno-dysregulation, and resolution of the underlying neutropenia prevents the cycle of ulceration. The relative increase in percentage of CD8+ T cells, caused by a reduction in numbers of CD4+ T cells may be implicated in RAS-type ulceration in HIV infection.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} breeds of dog, the Russian Toy can suffer from patellar luxation, {{which is where}} the knee cap slips out of place when the knee bends as the groove that {{normally}} holds it in place is too shallow. It is usually an inherited defect, which <b>occurs</b> <b>during</b> the development of the foetus and rarely by trauma.|$|E
5|$|During November, the Taurid {{meteor shower}} appears to radiate {{from the general}} {{direction}} of this constellation. The Beta Taurid meteor shower <b>occurs</b> <b>during</b> the months of June and July in the daytime, and is normally observed using radio techniques. Between 18 and 29 October, both the Northern Taurids and the Southern Taurids are active; though the latter stream is stronger. However, between November 1 and 10, the two streams equalize.|$|E

5|$|If the {{concentration}} of the inert gas in the breathing gas is reduced below that {{of any of the}} tissues, there is a tendency for gas to return from the tissues to the breathing gas. This is known as out-gassing, and <b>occurs</b> <b>during</b> decompression, when the reduction in ambient pressure reduces the partial pressure of the inert gas in the lungs. This process may be complicated by the formation of gas bubbles, and the modeling is more complex and varied.|$|E
5|$|In 1938 for a dance {{composition}} titled Bacchanale, John Cage {{invented the}} prepared piano, producing both transformed pitches and colorful unpitched {{sounds from the}} piano.

5|$|Mallards are opportunistically {{targeted}} by brood parasites, occasionally having eggs laid in their nests by redheads, ruddy ducks, lesser scaup, gadwalls, northern shovellers, northern pintails, cinnamon teal, common goldeneyes, and other mallards. These eggs are generally accepted when they resemble the eggs {{of the host}} mallard, but the hen may attempt to eject them or even abandon the nest if parasitism <b>occurs</b> <b>during</b> egg laying.|$|E
40|$|Background: Pineapple (Ananas comosus) is a {{tropical}} fruit crop of significant commercial importance. Although the physiological changes that <b>occur</b> <b>during</b> pineapple fruit development {{have been well}} characterized, {{little is known about}} the molecular events that <b>occur</b> <b>during</b> the fruit ripening process. Understanding the molecular basis of pineapple fruit ripening will aid the development of new varieties via molecular breeding or genetic modification. In this study we developed a 9277 element pineapple microarray and used it to profile gene expression changes that <b>occur</b> <b>during</b> pineapple fruit ripening...|$|R

5|$|Not much {{tropical}} activity <b>occurs</b> <b>during</b> {{the month}} of July, {{but the majority of}} hurricane seasons see the formation of one tropical cyclone during July. From an average of Atlantic tropical cyclone seasons from 1944 to 1996, the first tropical storm in half of the seasons occurred by 11 July, and a second formed by 8 August.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of the hurricane season is most {{closely related to the}} timing of increases in sea surface temperatures, convective instability, and other thermodynamic factors. Although June marks the {{beginning of}} the hurricane season, generally little activity <b>occurs</b> <b>during</b> the month with an average of 1 tropical cyclone every 2years. Tropical systems usually form in the Gulf of Mexico or off the east coast of the United States.|$|E
5|$|The chord pattern differs little {{throughout}} the song. On guitar, {{it consists of}} the chords (played with a capo at the fifth fret) of B minor 7, F minor, A minor 7, F, C, E sus. 7 and E7.
