5|$|If {{the date}} and time of any solar eclipse are known, it is {{possible}} to predict other eclipses using eclipse cycles. The saros is probably the best known {{and one of the most}} accurate. A saros lasts 6,585.3 days (a little over 18 years), which means that, after this period, a practically identical eclipse will occur. The most notable difference will be a westward shift of about 120° in longitude (due to the 0.3 days) and a little in latitude (north-south for odd-numbered cycles, the reverse for even-numbered ones). A saros series always starts with a partial eclipse near one of Earth's polar regions, then shifts <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>globe</b> through a series of annular or total eclipses, and ends with a partial eclipse at the opposite polar region. A saros series lasts 1226 to 1550 years and 69 to 87 eclipses, with about 40 to 60 of them being central.|$|E

5000|$|Trotskyists {{argue that}} the [...] "Stalinist USSR" [...] was not socialist (and not communist), but a bureaucratised {{degenerated}} workers' state—that is, a non-capitalist state in which exploitation is controlled by a ruling caste which, although not owning {{the means of production}} and not constituting a social class in its own right, accrued benefits and privileges {{at the expense of the}} working class.
