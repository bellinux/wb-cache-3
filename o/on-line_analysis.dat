2500|$|Mass {{spectrometry}} is {{also used}} to determine the isotopic composition of elements within a sample. Differences in mass among isotopes of an element are very small, and the less abundant isotopes of an element are typically very rare, so a very sensitive instrument is required. These instruments, sometimes referred to as isotope ratio mass spectrometers (IR-MS), usually use a single magnet to bend a beam of ionized particles towards a series of Faraday cups which convert particle impacts to electric current. A fast <b>on-line</b> <b>analysis</b> of deuterium content of water can be done using flowing afterglow mass spectrometry, FA-MS. Probably the most sensitive and accurate mass spectrometer for this purpose is the accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS). This is because it provides ultimate sensitivity, capable of measuring individual atoms and measuring nuclides with a dynamic range of ~1015 relative to the major stable isotope. Isotope ratios are important markers of a variety of processes. Some isotope ratios are used to determine the age of materials for example as in carbon dating. Labeling with stable isotopes {{is also used}} for protein quantification. (see protein characterization below) ...|$|E

He retired from CSIRO in 1997.John's research has covered a whole range of <b>on-line</b> <b>analysis</b> applications in the minerals, coal and oil industries.

The mass resolution of these devices is between 7000 and 10,500 m/Δm, thus it is possible to separate most common isobaric VOCs and quantify them independently.|$|E

50|$|Although {{particles}} and TOC are usually measured using on-line methods, {{there is significant}} value in complimentary or alternative off-line lab analysis. The value of the lab analysis has two aspects: cost and speciation. Smaller UPW facilities that cannot afford to purchase on-line instrumentation often choose off-line testing. TOC {{can be measured in}} the grab sample at a concentration as low as 5 ppb, using the same technique employed for the <b>on-line</b> <b>analysis</b> (see on-line method description). This detection level covers the majority of needs of less critical electronic and all pharmaceutical applications. When speciation of the organics is required for troubleshooting or design purposes, liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) provides an effective analysis. This method allows for identification of biopolymers, humics, low molecular weight acids and neutrals, and more, while characterizing nearly 100% of the organic composition in UPW with sub-ppb level of TOC.|$|E
50|$|Bioseparations on a {{production}} scale are enhanced by monolith column technologies as well. The fast separations and high resolving power of monoliths for large molecules means that real-time analysis on production fermentors is possible. Fermentation {{is well known}} for its use in making alcoholic beverages, but is also an essential step in the production of vaccines for rabies and other viruses. Real-time, <b>on-line</b> <b>analysis</b> is critical for monitoring of production conditions, and adjustments can be made if necessary. Boehringer Ingelheim Austria has validated a method with cGMP (commercial good manufacturing practices) for production of pharmaceutical-grade DNA plasmids. They are able to process 200L of fermentation broth on an 800mL monolith. At BIA Separations, processing time of the tomato mosaic virus decreased considerably from the standard five days of manually intensive work to equivalent purity and better recovery in only two hours with a monolith column. Other viruses have been purified on monoliths as well.|$|E

In this paper we propose an entropy-based scheduling strategy for running the <b>on-line</b> parallel <b>analysis</b> as a service more reliable and efficient, and implement the proposed idea in Spark. Entropy, {{as a measure of}} the degree of disorder in a system, is an indicator of a system’s tendency to progress out of order and into a chaotic condition, and it can thus serve to measure a cloud resource’s reliability for jobs scheduling.

40|$|Many rare-earth {{extraction}} processes require frequent {{control over}} separation process quality. Ideally, an analysis method {{for this type}} should be simple, rapid and reliable. Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectrometry, due to its relative simplicity of instrumentation, speed of analysis, and non-destructive nature, is well suited to this <b>on-line</b> <b>analysis</b> application.
