5000|$|Many OSS {{systems were}} {{initially}} not linked {{to each other}} and often required manual intervention. For example, consider the case where a customer wants to order a new telephone service. The ordering system would take the customer's details and details of their order, but {{would not be able to}} configure the telephone exchange directly--this would be done by a switch management system. Details of the new service would need to be transferred from the <b>order</b> <b>handling</b> system to the switch management system, and this would normally be done by a technician re-keying the details from one screen into another, a process often referred to as [...] "swivel chair integration". This was another source of inefficiency, so the focus for the next few years was on creating automated interfaces between the OSS applications.|$|E

50|$|Under Reuters, the Instinet {{platform}} {{continued to}} grow through the late 1980s and into the early 1990s. By {{the time that the}} U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission introduced the <b>Order</b> <b>Handling</b> Rules and alternative trading systems (ATS) regulation in the late 1990s. In 1992, Instinet expanded internationally. Douglas Atkin led the effort and by 1998 Instinet was operating in over 20 world markets and had grown revenues to approximately $100 million. Instinet was the dominant electronic communication network. However, these rules also gave rise to new competitors, some of whom employed new pricing schemes. By the early 2000s, these competitors, helped by missteps at Instinet that included rapid expansion, over-spending and slow uptake of technology, had managed to erode the firm’s market share. As a result, Instinet in 2002 merged with the Island ECN, renaming the Island technology platform Inet.|$|E
5000|$|At Ford Motor Company, the {{assembly}} line concept {{appears to have been}} introduced by William [...] "Pa" [...] Klann upon his return from visiting Swift & Company's slaughterhouse in Chicago and viewing what was referred to as the [...] "disassembly line", where carcasses were butchered as they moved along a conveyor. The efficiency of one person removing the same piece over and over without himself moving caught his attention. He reported the idea to Peter E. Martin, soon to be head of Ford production, who was doubtful at the time but encouraged him to proceed. Others at Ford have claimed to have put the idea forth to Henry Ford, but Pa Klann's slaughterhouse revelation is well documented in the archives at the Henry Ford Museum and elsewhere, making him an important contributor to the modern automated assembly line concept. Ford was appreciative, having visited the highly automated 40-acre Sears mail <b>order</b> <b>handling</b> facility around 1906. At Ford, the process was an evolution by trial and error of a team consisting primarily of Peter E. Martin, the factory superintendent; Charles E. Sorensen, Martin's assistant; Clarence W. Avery; C. Harold Wills, draftsman and toolmaker; Charles Ebender; and József Galamb. Some of the groundwork for such development had recently been laid by the intelligent layout of machine tool placement that Walter Flanders had been doing at Ford up to 1908.|$|E
50|$|Integrating OSSs {{means that}} data must be shared between the {{application}}s. For {{this to be}} effective, either each application must understand how every other application understands/interprets {{that part of the}} data that is shared, or there must be a common model of the shared data. To understand this, consider an <b>order</b> <b>handling</b> application which has gone through a process to enter a customer order and where it now needs to send out a bill using application B (a billing system). Application A will have a record of the customer address and it therefore needs to ensure that application B sends the bill to this address. Passing this data between the systems simply requires a common format for the address information - each system needs to expect the same number of address lines, with each line being the same length. That’s fairly straightforward. But imagine the difficulty that would occur if the ordering application worked on products that consists of bundles of sub-products (e.g. a broadband access product made from a copper line, a modem, a set of filters and a broadband conversion), whereas the billing application only expected single product/order lines. Trying to convert hierarchical products into non-hierarchical ones without losing information would not be possible. A single information model for data that is shared between applications in this way provides a solution to this problem. The TMF solution to this is called the Shared Information/Data-Model (SID).|$|E

40|$|Current service <b>order</b> <b>handling</b> {{systems in}} {{telecommunications}} industry have {{problems such as}} user-unfriendliness, long service waiting time, uneasy customization of services, limited capability of in-house services, and inefficient human resources allocation. Consequently, the current solutions for the ordering process cannot be used to meet the business needs of service providers. To solve this problem, a generic service <b>order</b> <b>handling</b> model is suggested. Based on the TINA-C information modeling and computation modeling concepts, service <b>order</b> <b>handling</b> information object types and interfaces were defined. The three ordering interfaces studied in this model are: service negotiation, service ordering and order tracking for the main service provider and subcontracted service provider.

40|$|Abstract – The rapid {{development}} of IT&T technology had {{big impact on}} the traditional telecommunications market, transforming it from monopolistic market to highly competitive high-tech market where new services are required to be created frequently. This paper aims to describe a design approach that puts order management process (as part of enterprise application integration) in function of rapid service creation. In the text we will present a framework for collaborative <b>order</b> <b>handling</b> supporting convergent services. The design splits the <b>order</b> <b>handling</b> processes in convergent environments in three business process groups: order capture, order management and order fulfillment. The paper establishes abstract framework for <b>order</b> <b>handling</b> and provides design guidelines for transaction handling implementation based on the checkpoint and inverse command strategy. The proposed design approach is based in a convergent telecommunication environment. Same principles are applicable in solving problems of collaboration in function of order processing in any given heterogeneous environment...|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{components}} of the bid-ask spread in the Athens Stock Exchange (ASE), which was recently characterized as a developed market. For large and medium capitalization stocks, we estimate the adverse selection and the <b>order</b> <b>handling</b> component of the spreads as well as the probability of a trade continuation {{on the same side of}} either the bid or the ask price, using the Madhavan et al. ~(1997) model. We extend it by incorporating the traded volume and we find that the adverse selection component exhibits U-shape patterns, while the cost component pattern depends on the stock price. For high priced stocks, the usual U-shape applies, while for low-priced ones, it is an increasing function of time, mainly due to the <b>order</b> <b>handling</b> spread component. Furthermore, the expected price change and the liquidity adjustment to Value-at-Risk that is needed is higher in the low capitalization stocks, while the most liquid stocks are the high priced ones. Moreover, by estimating the Madhavan et al. ~(1997) model for two distinct periods we explain why there are differences in {{the components of}} the bid-ask spread.
