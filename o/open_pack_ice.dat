40|$|The optimum {{design for}} an icebreaking tanker {{will depend on}} the trade route and the cargo {{delivery}} requirements. For example, the hull shape of a ship that spends almost all of its time operating in heavy ice can be optimized for low speed icebreaking conditions. In contrast, a ship that spends a small portion of its time in light ice that has been previously broken and the rest of its time in open water can be optimized for different requirements. The challenge for the designer is complicated by the observation that many ship design features that enhance powering performance in ice are detrimental to open water performance. This paper presents predictions of ship resistance in <b>pack</b> <b>ice,</b> level ice and open water for four tanker designs, which include a conventional hull with no modification for ice at all and three designs proposed for operation in Arctic ice conditions. The predictions of ship performance are based on model experiments carried out in Canada and Korea. The resistance of the four hulls in open water, two concentrations of <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> and two level ice thicknesses are compared and discussed. Information of this sort is essential for developing the optimum ship design for a particular shipping route, given known profiles of <b>open</b> water, <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> and level ice.

An inertial measurement system was used to measure the whole-ship motions of the USCGC Healy during its Ice Trials, April/May 2000. The system provided time-series traces of ship motions in six degrees of freedom. A variety of loading conditions was sampled, ranging from relatively light ice conditions to backing and ramming in pressured first- year ice and multi- year ice. The ship motions experienced under the different ice conditions ranged from pitch angles of 0. 20 to 0. 80 and roll angles of 0. 60 to 4. 90.

40|$|We {{measured}} {{light absorption}} in 42 marine snow, sea ice, seawater, brine, and frost flower samples {{collected during the}} OASIS field campaign between February 27 and April 15, 2009. Samples represented multiple sites between landfast ice and <b>open</b> <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> in coastal areas approximately 5 km west of Barrow, Alaska. The chromophores that are most commonly measured in snow, H 2 O 2, NO 3 -, and NO 2 -, on average account for less than 1 % of sunlight absorption in our samples. Instead, light absorption is dominated by unidentified "residual" species, likely organic compounds. Light absorption coefficients for the frost flowers on first-year sea ice are, on average, 40 times larger than values for terrestrial snow samples at Barrow, suggesting very large rates of photochemical reactions in frost flowers. For our marine samples the calculated rates of sunlight absorption and OH production from known chromophores are (0. 1 - 1. 4) x 10 ** 14 (photons/cm** 3 /s) and (5 - 70) x 10 **- 12 (mol/L/s), respectively. Our residual spectra are similar to spectra of marine chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), suggesting that CDOM is the dominant chromophore in our samples. Based on our light absorption measurements we estimate dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in Barrow seawater and frost flowers as approximately 130 and 360 µM C, respectively.

The three case studies examined are: warm air advection over dense <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> causing strong elevated ducting and subrefraction, cold air advection over relatively open water causing shallow convection and normal refraction condi­tions, large scale subsidence in the western quadrants of an anticyclone leading to super-refraction and weak ducting. Developing synoptic scale cyclones adjacent to the MIZEX- 83 area often determined the airflow over the region. The observed large horizontal SST gradients were the dominant forcing mechanisms on surface layer stability. Trapping layers associated with subsidence inversions can be located on satellite imagery by assuming that stratiform clouds form immediately below the inversion. Uniform cloud and refraction layers were not common during MIZEX- 83 due to strong mesoscale variability. Factors affecting inversion height include subsidence and entrainment mixing.

40|$|The Arctic Ocean has {{experienced}} wide-spread decreases in sea ice concentrations that may impact various marine ecosystems. This study analyzes yearlong ocean acoustic recordings from north of Barrow, Alaska, to provide baseline measurements prior to possible increases in anthropogenic activities. In September 2006, two autonomous High-frequency Acoustic Recording Packages (HARPs) were deployed to the seafloor (250 m), where sound was continuously recorded by hydrophones for nine months. Ice conditions during the recordings included <b>open</b> water, <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> formation, shore-fast canopies, and thermal breakup, providing {{a wide range}} of Arctic Ocean acoustic measurements. Spectral-averaging was used to determine received sound-pressure levels. Across the low-frequency band, fall was the noisiest season, reaching 87 dB re [mu]Pa between 20 - 60 Hz, while 10 % of October was exposed to noise above 130 dB re [mu]Pa at 10 Hz and 112 dB re [mu]Pa between 20 - 30 Hz; seismic airguns were present from September to November. Acoustic data was compared with sea ice concentration and wind speed; during summer and fall, sound-pressure spectrum levels correlate directly with high wind speeds, typically indicative of low-pressure atmospheric events. Throughout winter and spring, strong winds and thermal fracturing in sea ice opens leads, resulting in correlations with spectral energy-peaks. Bioacoustic recordings of cetaceans and pinnipeds were analyzed using long-term spectral-averages to determine presence or absence on an hourly basis.

40|$|The global ship impact {{forces on}} the CCGS Amundsen are {{quantified}} here for 44 impacts with multi-year ice floes in the Beaufort Sea. Global impact forces were derived from an inertial measurement system called MOTAN. In general, global forces of up to 9. 0 MN were measured for maximum impact speed from 3. 1 to 10. 2 kt. Most of the impacts were conducted with two floes of known thickness and strength. Only two floes were sampled during the two-week program, but they characterized {{a wide spectrum of}} multi-year ice. Floe B 1 S 1 was the thinner of the two floes (7. 2 m), quite warm, saline and relatively weak (the depth-averaged borehole strength of the two test holes was 7. 3 MPa and 4. 5 MPa). Floe B 1 S 2 was thicker (8. 0 m), colder, less saline and stronger (the depth-averaged borehole strength of the uppermost 7 m of ice was 22. 0 MPa). As anticipated, global impact forces and ship accelerations were higher during collisions with the thicker, stronger floe than the weaker floe, for comparable ship speeds. The highest surge acceleration (1. 03 m/s 2) occurred during the final ram with Floe B 1 S 2 which was conducted at a maximum impact speed of 6. 7 kt. That collision generated the highest global impact force of the program: 9. 0 MN. The highest heave acceleration (0. 84 m/s 2) and sway acceleration (0. 46 m/s 2) occurred during rams with Floe B 1 S 1, while transiting to a natural harbour within the floe. Global forces from 18 impacts with isolated multi-year floes floating in <b>open</b> <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> were comparable to many of the rams with Floe B 1 S 1, for a given impact speed. Comparison of the Commanding Officer 2 ̆ 019 s expected ice severity for the 18 impacts indicated that even experienced personnel can have difficulty ascertaining the competency of multi-year ice. Impact forces and accelerations measured by MOTAN on the CCGS Amundsen were comparable to MOTAN-derived measurements on the CCGS Terry Fox from oblique impacts with bergy bits. The maximum heave, surge and sway accelerations on the CCGS Terry Fox were respectively 0. 57 m/s 2, 0. 56 m/s 2 and 1. 24 m/s 2 during the Bergy Bit Trials, with measured global impact forces of up to 10. 6 MN. Global impact forces and accelerations on the CCGS Amundsen during this study were not nearly as high as the impact forces measured by other instrumentation systems on ships operating more aggressively in Beaufort Sea multi-year ice.
