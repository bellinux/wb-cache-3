5|$|After {{the train}} is {{dispatched}} and enters Wonder Mountain, riders {{find themselves in a}} graveyard where zombies are roaming. At the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> riders who began facing forward see a survivor directing them to the next scene. Riders who were seated backwards do not see this transition. The next scene takes place in a house overrun by the zombies and large spiders. At the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> a truck crashes into the house. Riders then leave the house and pass the survivor; this transition is again absent for backward-seated riders. The train continues to a road with zombies, where three cars with zombies on them join the riders. Two of the cars crash at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> The train then passes through a tunnel with abandoned cars; this scene is absent for riders facing backward. Riders then battle the zombies for the final time before entering the drop track sequence. The names of the highest-scoring riders are displayed on a leader-board for this version of the attraction.|$|E

5|$|A {{mirror on}} the back wall {{reflects}} the upper bodies and heads of two figures identified from other paintings, and by Palomino, as King PhilipIV(10) and Queen Mariana(11). The most common assumption is that the reflection shows the couple in the pose they are holding for Velázquez as he paints them, while their daughter watches; and that the painting therefore shows their view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b>|$|E

50|$|The show is {{partially}} filmed in the Hudson Valley Area. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> are shot in <b>the</b> small village <b>of</b> Nyack, NY (35 miles North of Manhattan).

5|$|A {{seamless}} 40-second driving scene, {{in which}} Michael Sullivan {{and his son}} travel into Chicago from the countryside, was aided by visual effects. The live-action part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> was filmed at LaSalle Street, and {{due to the lack}} of scenery for part of the drive down LaSalle Street, the background of Balbo Drive was included with the use of visual effects.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, there were popular hip hop songs, and the celebrities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> like LL Cool J, gained mainstream renown. Other performers experimented with politicized lyrics and social awareness, or fused hip hop with jazz, heavy metal, techno, funk and soul. New styles appeared {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s, like alternative hip hop and the closely related jazz rap fusion, pioneered by rappers like De La Soul.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Radioactive Films used a {{scene from}} Striptease {{featuring}} Moore nude in a video called Hollywood's Hottest. This raised a dispute as to whether use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> qualified as fair use. A lawsuit was launched as a consequence.|$|E

5|$|Molly Haskell {{has argued}} that nevertheless, women are mostly {{uncritical}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> and that by and large it is consistent with what women have in mind if they fantasize about being raped. Their fantasies revolve around love and romance rather than forced sex; they will assume that Scarlett was not an unwilling sexual partner and wanted Rhett {{to take the initiative}} and insist on having sexual intercourse.|$|E

5|$|Rōjaku (老弱): Rō means old, and jaku means {{tranquil}} and quiet.

5|$|The {{film was}} an early example of efforts to move beyond theater {{blocking}} conventions. During the police raid, depth was demonstrated by having action take place in both the foreground and the background, and by allowing actors to move between them. This cinematography technique improved the realism and pacing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b>|$|E
5|$|While the {{painting}} largely representedand {{was one of}} the pioneers ofan emerging style, the work was criticised by several authorities on the subject. The reasons for this varied from Delaroche's depiction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> to a general disapproval of Delaroche himself. Many of those who were in the latter state of mind felt that Delaroche was trying to match the genius of Napoleon in some way, and had failed miserably in doing so.|$|E

5|$|After {{the alarm}} had been raised, a major {{investigation}} commenced involving detectives from the Dublin Metropolitan North Central Division and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI). The {{house and the}} surrounding area were subject to a forensic examination by the Garda Technical Bureau. Gardaí performed house to house inquiries, took more than 1000 statements, and interviewed over 250 suspects. A postmortem examination of the bodies was made by the State Pathologist, Professor John Harbison; his first report was delivered on 13 March 1997. No material was found either by the forensic examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> or by the postmortem examination that would have linked a suspect to the crime.|$|E
5|$|As noon {{drew near}} with no sight of either Huger or Magruder, who were {{supposed}} to be manning the Confederate right flank, Lee replaced these two forces with the smaller units of Brig. Gens. Armistead and Wright, two of Huger's brigades that had reached the battlefield some time earlier. Huger and his other two brigades (under Brig. Gens. Ransom and Mahone) were still too far north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> Despite the mishaps and disunity, Malvern Hill would be the first time during the Seven Days Battles that Lee managed to concentrate his force.|$|E
5|$|Bean {{starred in}} the espionage {{television}} series Legends as Martin Odum, an FBI agent who takes on various fabricated identities to go undercover. The show was cancelled after its second season. An intensive viral marketing campaign was centred on the hashtag #DontKillSeanBean, focusing on the various deaths of his past characters and promising his character in Legends would not suffer the same fate. The campaign culminated with a Funny or Die exclusive video featuring Bean filming a scene for the show where he's become so accustomed to dying on screen that he expects his character to die a bizarrely gruesome death despite the simplicity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b>|$|E

5|$|Dialogue {{heard in}} the dream {{sequence}} uses a distinctive reversed manner of speech. This was achieved by recording the actors' line phonetically reversed, and playing this audio backwards. David Lynch had begun experimenting with the technique in 1971, and had originally planned {{to use it in}} his 1977 debut feature, Eraserhead, before it finally found use in this episode. Describing the process of learning his lines backwards, Anderson notes that he first worked out the phonemes of each word rather than simply reading it back to front, and disregarded the inflection of any given word as this helped bolster the discordant effect of the end result. The reversed audio was also altered with a slight reverb effect. The actors were required to perform their movements backwards, as elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> would be reversed entirely.|$|E
5|$|During post-production, Vasan asked Ramnoth {{his opinion}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> when {{hundreds}} of Veerasimhan's warriors storm the palace to rescue Chandralekha from Sasankan. Although the scene's photography, shots and action had been unanimously praised by others, Ramnoth was quiet before {{saying that the}} suspense might be ruined if the scene was shown uncut. This sparked a discussion; Vasan advised Chandru to edit in accordance with Ramnoth's direction, and {{was impressed with the}} result. C. E. Biggs was the film's audio engineer.|$|E
5|$|For {{the scene}} in which Ash is {{revealed}} to be an android, a puppet was created of the character's torso and upper body which was operated from underneath. During a preview screening of the film, this scene caused an usher to faint. In the following scene, Ash's head is placed on a table and re-activated; for portions of this scene, an animatronic head was made using a face cast of the actor, Ian Holm. However, the latex of the head shrank while curing {{and the result was}} not entirely convincing. For the bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> Holm knelt under the table with his head coming up through a hole. Milk, caviar, pasta, fiber optics, and glass marbles were combined to form the android's innards.|$|E
