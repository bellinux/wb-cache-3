5|$|Habitat {{modification}} or {{destruction is}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> issues affecting amphibian species worldwide. As amphibians generally need aquatic and terrestrial habitats to survive, threats to either habitat can affect populations. Hence, amphibians {{may be more}} vulnerable to habitat modification than organisms that only require one habitat type. Large scale climate changes may further be modifying aquatic habitats, preventing amphibians from spawning altogether.|$|E

With the Sounder's slow season start and midseason turmoil, the team's turnaround from bottom of the league to eventual champions is considered one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> comebacks in MLS history.|$|E

5|$|The {{match is}} {{considered}} to be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> conclusions to a league season {{in the history of the}} English game. It is also regarded as the starting point of a renaissance in English football; the ban on English clubs playing in European football was lifted a year later and a new top-flight division – the Premier League, was formed in 1992 which generated more revenue for clubs. The title decider also formed the centrepiece of Nick Hornby's book Fever Pitch.|$|E
5|$|The K–Pg {{boundary}} {{represents one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> turnovers in {{the fossil record}} for various calcareous nanoplankton that formed the calcium deposits that gave the Cretaceous its name. The turnover in this group is clearly marked at the species level. Statistical analysis of marine losses at this time suggests that the decrease in diversity was caused more by {{a sharp increase in}} extinctions, than by a decrease in speciation. The K–Pg boundary record of dinoflagellates is not so well understood, mainly because only microbial cysts provide a fossil record, and not all dinoflagellate species have cyst-forming stages, thereby, likely causing diversity to be underestimated. Recent studies indicate that there were no major shifts in dinoflagellates through the boundary layer.|$|E

25|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> {{effects of}} the war was the {{expansion}} of governmental powers and responsibilities in Britain, France, the United States, and the Dominions of the British Empire. To harness all the power of their societies, governments created new ministries and powers. New taxes were levied and laws enacted, all designed to bolster the war effort; many have lasted to this day. Similarly, the war strained the abilities of some formerly large and bureaucratised governments, such as in Austria-Hungary and Germany.|$|E
25|$|Barcelona also {{reached the}} 1986 European Cup Final, {{although}} {{they lost to}} Steaua București in a penalty shoot-out following a 0–0 draw.

25|$|Like {{the video}} camera, most {{sampling}} schemes are periodic; that is, {{they have a}} characteristic sampling frequency in time or in space.

Audio signals are sampled (digitized) with an analog-to-digital converter, which produces a constant number of samples per second. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> and subtle examples of aliasing occur when the signal being sampled also has periodic content.|$|E

The other includes reproductions of various works of Italian Renaissance sculpture and architecture, including a full-size replica of Michelangelo's David. Replicas of two earlier Davids by Donatello and Verrocchio, are also included, although for conservation reasons the Verrocchio replica is displayed in a glass case.|$|E
25|$|The Western Federation of Miners (WFM) was {{a radical}} labor union that gained a {{reputation}} for militancy in the mines of the western United States and British Columbia. Its efforts to organize both hard rock miners and smelter workers brought it into sharp conflicts – and often pitched battles – with both employers and governmental authorities. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> of these struggles occurred in the Cripple Creek district in 1903–04, and {{has been called the}} Colorado Labor Wars. The WFM also {{played a key role in}} the founding of the Industrial Workers of the World in 1905, but left that organization several years later.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> {{matches in}} {{the long history of}} the fixture {{occurred}} in the 1870s. The first of these was 'Cobden's Match' in 1870. F. C. Cobden took the last three Oxford wickets in consecutive balls to give Cambridge victory by 2 runs. The following year S. E. Butler took 10-38 in the Cambridge first innings (the only instance of a bowler taking all ten), followed by five more wickets in the second innings. In 1873 Oxford won by only three wickets. The 1875 match was almost as close an affair as that in 1870. Needing 175 to win, Cambridge were 161-7 at one point, but were all out for 168 to lose by six runs.|$|E

25|$|Florida posted another 9–1–1 {{record in}} 1985, Hall's first full season as head coach, and was briefly ranked {{number one in}} the AP Poll {{for the first time in}} school history. The Gators {{finished}} the season atop the SEC standings, but were ineligible for the conference title. Although he never had a losing season, Hall's subsequent teams did not match his early success when the scholarship losses for Pell's violations took their full effect; his first two recruiting classes had only 25 players. The unranked 1986 Gators upset the Auburn Tigers, 18–17. Kerwin Bell led the Gators to overcome a 17–0 fourth-quarter deficit in a game still considered one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> in Florida Field history.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of the nineteenth century, the game of {{baseball}} began to evolve from a sport played by amateurs for recreation into a more serious game played by professionals. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> changes was the transition of the pitcher's delivery from an underhand motion to an overhanded throw. Before the American Civil War, the pitcher's role was to initiate the action by offering an underhanded throw to the batter, in much the same way that a basketball referee offers up a jump ball to begin play. Since this type of pitching often caused the batter to hit lazy, foul pop-ups, catchers played their position approximately twenty to twenty-five feet behind the batter, and wore no protective equipment.|$|E
25|$|On 23 July, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> single {{events in}} the {{conflict}} occurred when another police border patrol was attacked in an NLA ambush near Raduša. The police patrol was led by Aco Stojanovski, the Deputy-Commander of the Raduša police station. The insurgents fired at the police vehicle with RPG rockets, throwing three policemen {{out of the car}} and leaving one inside. The NLA attempted to approach the badly wounded policemen. Commander Stojanovski's firing six rounds from an AK-47 at the insurgents saved them until soldiers from the Raduša border post arrived and repelled the NLA with fire from an armored personnel carrier. After the conflict, commander Stojanovski became the president of the Union of Army and Police veterans of the Conflict in Macedonia.|$|E
