50|$|Some {{suggest that}} the best way to find the exact {{positions}} of shrutis is by analyzing the frequencies players use in actual performances. This sounds simple, but runs the risk of giving multiple inaccurate values. In fact, when different artists performed raga Yaman on flute, sarangi, sitar, and voice, accuracy of pitch was found to be 'relative' and 'subjective', and 'neither rigidly fixed','nor randomly varying'. Further, the 'same Swara was pitched differently at different times by the same artiste in the same raga', and 'different artistes intoned the same swara differently in the same raga'. Such an exercise is akin to finding the centre of a circle by analyzing the positions of arrows shot by the archers on the board. This can give multiple answers without indicating which one is accurate. It is more accurate to find the centre of a circle mathematically. Similarly, the values of 22 shrutis can be precisely calculated based on their natural relationships to the 22 Shruti-Mandal (<b>Organogram)</b> rather than an analysis of performances.|$|E

40|$|Space {{is often}} {{designed}} {{based on the}} representations of user activities (i. e. lists, <b>organograms</b> or flowcharts) that streamline user activities in stepwise, oversimplified, representations that may leave insufficient room for future activity development. However, design can anticipate activity development if users are able to represent their own activities while participating in the design process. A case study of a medical imaging centre reveals that once users have such opportunity, their spatial practices are not only taken into account but also expanded. The designers, the users and the researchers created a range of instruments to expand across three units of analysis: operations, actions and activities. As a result, the representations of space proffered by the designers were expanded to a space of representation for the users, where new ways of working were realized. Based on this study, an integrated model {{for the production of}} space and the development of activity is proposed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a {{possible}} improvement of knowledge-based decision support systems for human resource management within Public Administrations, using a co-creation of value’s mechanism, according to the Service-Dominant Logic (SDL) paradigm. In particular, it applies ontology-driven data entry procedures to trigger the cooperation between the Public Administration itself and its employees. Advantages in such sense are evident: constraining the data entry process {{by means of the}} term definition ontology improves the quality of gathered data, thus reducing potential mismatching problems and allowing a suitable skill gap analysis among real and ideal workers competence profiles. The procedure foresees the following steps: analyzing <b>organograms</b> and job descriptions; modelling Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes (KSA) for job descriptions; transforming KSAs of job descriptions into a standard-based model with integrations of other characteristics; extracting information from Curricula Vitae according to the selected model; comparing profiles and roles played by the employees. The 'a priori' ontology-driven approach adequately supports the operations that involve both the Public Administration and employees, as for the data storage of job descriptions and curricula vitae. The comparison step is useful to understand if employees perform roles that are coherent with their own professional profiles. The proposed approach has been experimented on a small test case and the results show that its objective evaluation represents an improvement for a decision support system for the re-organization of Italian Public Administrations where, unfortunately often, people are engaged in activities that are not so close to their competences. </div...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Strengthening health {{research}} {{is an important}} objective for international health organisations, {{but there has been}} less attention to support for {{health research}} in Europe. We describe the public-health (population and organisational level) research systems in the 27 European Union countries. Methods We developed a typology for describing health research structures based on funding streams and strategies. We drew data from internet sources and asked country informants to review these for consistency and completeness. The structures were described as <b>organograms</b> and narratives in country profiles for each of the 27 EU member states. National public-health research structures included public and independent funding organisations, 'mixed' institutions (which receive funds, and both use and allocate them) and provider institutions. Results Most health research is funded through ministries of science or science councils (and sometimes foundations), while parliaments and regions may also contribute. National institutes of public health are usually funded by ministries of health. Many national research organisations both determine research programmes and undertake health research, but there is a move towards public-health sciences within the universities, and a transition from internal grants to competitive funding. Of 27 national research strategies, 17 referred to health and 11 to public health themes. Although all countries had strategies for public health itself, we found little coherence in public-health research programmes. The European Commission has country contact points for both EU research and health programmes, but they do not coordinate with national health-research programmes. Conclusions Public-health research is broadly distributed across programmes in EU countries. Better understanding of research structures, programmes and results would improve recognition for public health in Europe, and contribute to practice. EU ministries of health should give greater attention to national public-health research strategies and programmes, and the European Union and the World Health Organisation can provide coordination and support. </p...|$|R
30|$|The {{focus on}} {{international}} aid finds {{expression in the}} depiction of the humanitarian aid as a system whereby different parts are connected in a functional way. The <b>organogram</b> of this system has the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) {{at the top and}} a second layer consisting of UN agencies, INGOs and the Red Cross/Red Crescent movement. A third layer might be added representing national-level aid providers, but it is also likely that these were left out of the picture. The foundation of the system consists of humanitarian principles, while the interagency standing committee (IASC) spurs a large number of policies and recipes for providing humanitarian aid. In the margin of the machine, quality mechanisms such as ALNAP, 2 Sphere, 3 HAP 4 and People in Aid (which have now been brought together in the Core Humanitarian Standard alliance 5) are seen to oil the machine and do the necessary repair work.|$|E
40|$|Among the {{deformities}} of the thoracic wall, {{pectus carinatum}} {{has not received}} the same attention as has pectus excavatum. Few pulmonologists, pediatricians, and thoracic surgeons {{are aware of the}} approaches to treating this condition. As a consequence, patients with pectus carinatum are not referred for treatment. This deformity, with an incidence of 1 : 1000 teenagers, is oligosymptomatic. However, for aesthetic and emotional reasons, it accounts for a large number of medical appointments. Such patients are introverted and do not engage in physical activities, since they are unwilling to expose their chest, which also discourages them from going to the beach or to swimming pools. The diagnosis is clinical and visual, and details are obtained through chest X-rays and computed tomography. The treatment is based on a well-known <b>organogram</b> that summarizes orthopedic and surgical procedures.

40|$|A {{workshop}} {{paper on}} water distribution in rural smallholder farming projects in Zimbabwe. The issues raised are {{examined in the}} context of Chibuwe Irrigation Scheme. On the basis of how water was distributed between 1993 and 1996, this chapter hopes to make some observations about water distribution in particular and water management in general. The material points to water distribution being the domain of the water bailiff where he is the main but not the only player. Technical and social skills were important to make water distribution a reality. In this context, technical skills referred to the operation of technical infrastructure while social skills dealt with negotiations, ability and capacity regarding water distribution. The skills, however, were mostly self-taught in the light of largely inappropriate official management models. Important observations from the material are that, in the first instance, technology need not only be put at the centre of the irrigation discourse, but should include non-engineering aspects if fresh insights are to be obtained. This is because smallholder irrigation schemes involve more than the application of engineering principles. Moreover, management must be redefined to take account of the specific contexts of the schemes in question and, must of necessity, be preoccupied less with putting labels on what ideally must be done. This entails realizing that <b>organograms</b> when used as management frameworks constitute vertical attempts to impose management models that do not take account of the fact that management is done by a variety of actors on a 'horizontal' scale. Different actors stake out management domains for themselves. Special thanks are due to the Netherlands Organization for International Cooperation in Higher Education (NUFFIC), The Hague, for providing financial support towards the hosting of the workshop upon which this book is based. NUFFIC also met part of the publication costs.

40|$|The British Geological Survey (BGS) has a {{long history}} of {{capacity}} building in geological surveys and energy/mines ministries and departments in the developing world and post conflict situations. In recent research involving business and training needs analysis (BTNA), the relationships between such public sector bodies, their stakeholders, and large aid donors, has been studied in detail, particularly in countries of central Asia, southeast Asia and the Pacific (Stephenson et al. 2002, Stephenson 2003, Stephenson & Penn 2003). The methodology and aims of this analysis are presented here as a guide for BGS personnel that may be working in a training capacity overseas or who might be writing a bid or proposal for training in developing or post conflict countries. This is followed by a discussion of the wider context of capacity building in which this work is carried out. The purpose of business analysis is to understand the business of the organisation and its relationship with its external stakeholders. Data are collected internally by researching relevant literature including business plans, corporate <b>organograms,</b> training plans, mission statements and job descriptions, and by interview with senior managers. External data are gathered by discussing the organisation with a representative sample of its clients, through a series of structured interviews. Appendices 1 and 2 present questionnaires that may be adapted for use in business analysis. Training needs analysis takes stock of the current skills and knowledge of employees and places it against the required skills and knowledge, gained from the business analysis. Data are collected in the form of staff lists, job descriptions, employment histories, training records and information from staff appraisal. Structured interviews are also conducted with all staff. Appendices 3 and 4 present questionnaires that may be adapted for use in training needs analysis. A typical BTNA 'solution' will comprise a training plan that will solve present skills shortage problems in line with business need. This is likely to focus as much on transferable skills, such as information technology and writing/presentation, as on science. It will also probably contain a 'sustainable training system', which is installed to ensure that all training activities are undertaken as part of a cycle of action, review and modification to allow continual adjustment of training to the changing business ofthe organisation. Business and training needs analysis takes place in a wider context of capacity building which is often funded by donor and lending organisations like the World Bank, DFID and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The influence of such organisations is often not as good as it might be, partly because aid of this kind tends to be a compromise between what the recipient organisation needs and what the aid donor wants to give, and partly because the integration and management of large aid projects is often not done primarily with the recipient organisation's needs in mind. In such cases a sound understanding of the aid donors' agendas and projects is needed, and strategies must be developed to mitigate and develop these in line with the needs of the organisation...|$|R
40|$|Staff, {{previously}} {{employed by}} Public Technical and Vocation Education and Training (TVET) Colleges, migrated (transferred) to the Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) {{in terms of}} Section 197 of the Labour Relations Act. This treatise investigates the legal consequences of the migration of the staff from the fifty (50) TVET Colleges to DHET and focuses on the different categories of staff. The conditions of service of all the categories of staff before migration are compared with that after the migration. Meaningful recommendations are made about negotiations that should {{take place in the}} respective bargaining chambers in order to ensure a smooth transition that will prevent unnecessary legal consequences in future. The treatise furthermore analyses the legal consequences of staff, employed by temporary employment services to perform outsourced functions at TVET Colleges, who did not migrate to DHET. The legal implications of these members of staff is debated and evaluated. The treatise also discusses the performance management system and the changes from the integrated quality management system of lecturers to the performance management development system of public servants. TVET Colleges absorb the employment costs (as a separate employer) to ensure that there is growth in the Full Time Equivalents of Ministerial programmes, funded by DHET. The treatise makes meaningful recommendations to the new employer (DHET) with regard to the appointment of staff to conduct ministerial programmes and the overtime remuneration of current staff that willingly agree to work overtime but are not fairly remunerated by DHET. The treatise also considers {{the second phase of the}} migration process, namely the development of a blueprint <b>organogram</b> and the development of job descriptions for the different functions identified on the <b>organogram.</b> The process should ideally be followed by a restructuring process where staff are placed in identified functions and must be capacitated to perform the functions adequately. This process will ensure alignment of functions in the fifty TVET Colleges. Finally, the treatise notes the issue of workplace discipline at the TVET College and the definition of the workplace. It offers a proposal to the DHET to negotiate with the unions about defining the workplace as this has a legal consequence for attaining the objective of sound labour relations. It make meaningful recommendations about the overlapping regulatory requirements applicable to the TVET College as a legal person and DHET as an employer...|$|E

40|$|The {{pectus excavatum}} {{treatment}} has two different approaches: non-surgical techniques (modified dynamic thoracic compressor, exercises and the vacuum bell) or surgical techniques (silastic or solid silicone implant, open surgical repair like sternochondroplasty and minimally invasive repair). The introduction of Nuss procedure improved the pectus excavatum treatment, but its low acceptance {{was due to}} the high complication rate (e. g. cardiac perfuration). The thoracoscopy use for bar mediastinal passage reduced the complication rate. In comparison with sternochondroplasty, the Nuss procedure has smaller incision, less blood loss and less operative time. However, it has more reoperations, complications, longer hospital stay and more readmission rates, more time of thoracic epidural catheter for postoperative analgesia and more need for analgesic after being discharged. Although Nuss procedure has been used in children, patients under ten years must be only observed. The Nuss procedure is applicable to moderate or light symmetrical pectus excavatum, without costal protrusion, in young and adolescents patients.
