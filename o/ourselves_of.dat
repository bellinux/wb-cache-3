25|$|As the war progressed, with no hope {{of joining}} the {{rebellion}} due to power of the Royal Navy (in the letter he had addressed to Bermudians soliciting the theft of the gunpowder, George Washington had written We would not wish to in volve you in an Opposition, in which from your Situation, we should be unable to support you: – We knew not therefore to what Extent to sollicit your Assistance in availing <b>ourselves</b> <b>of</b> this Supply), with increasing numbers of American loyalists in Bermuda (such as the privateer Bridger Goodrich), and with their economic opportunities dwindling, Bermudians overcame their sympathies for their erstwhile countrymen and unleashed their privateers (which, {{by the middle of}} the 18th century already outnumbered those of any of the mainland colonies) upon American shipping. The Bermudian effectiveness was such that, when the US sued British privateers for wrongful seizures in British courts, following the war, a sizable part of the damages they were awarded were to have come from Bermudians, like Hezekiah Frith (although, with the local authorities tasked with collecting these damages being in sympathy with the defendants, most of these damages were never paid).|$|E
500|$|Samuel Johnson {{pointed out}} that an appeal to {{conscience}} should not allow the law to bring unjust suffering upon another. Conscience, according to Johnson, {{was nothing more than}} a conviction felt by <b>ourselves</b> <b>of</b> something to be done or something to be avoided; in questions of simple unperplexed morality, conscience is very often a guide that may be trusted. But before conscience can conclusively determine what morally should be done, he thought that the state of the question should be thoroughly known. [...] "No man's conscience", said Johnson [...] "can tell him the right of another man... it is a conscience very ill informed that violates the rights of one man, for the convenience of another." ...|$|E
500|$|As Kostova explains, [...] "Dracula is {{a metaphor}} for the evil that is so hard to undo in history." [...] For example, he is shown {{influencing}} Eastern European tyrants and supporting national socialism in Transylvania. He is [...] "vainglorious, vindictive, [...] vicious". As Michael Dirda explains in The Washington Post, the novel conveys the idea that [...] "Most of history's worst nightmares result from an unthinking obedience to authority, high-minded zealotry seductively overriding our mere humanity." [...] It is in the figure of the vampire that Kostova reveals this, since [...] "our fear of Dracula lies in the fear of losing <b>ourselves,</b> <b>of</b> relinquishing our very identities as human beings". In fact, the narrator is never named in the novel, suggesting, as one critic explains, [...] "that the quest for the dark side of human nature is more universal than specific to a concrete character".|$|E

500|$|After its release, [...] "This Used to Be My Playground" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of , called the track a [...] "melancholic performance". Michelle Morgan, {{author of the}} book Madonna, described it as a [...] "beautiful ballad". Similarly, Humberto Quiroga Lavié called it one of Madonna's best ballads in his essay Secretos y Misterios de Hombres y Mujeres. Author Rikky Rooksby wrote in his book The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, that the song was appropriate for the film and its nostalgic moment towards the end, showing the characters grown up and reuniting at a museum opened for themselves and the titular league. He called it [...] "one of Madonna's very best recordings and most expressive single". While reviewing Something to Remember, author Chris Wade wrote in his book The Music of Madonna, that the song conjured up a [...] "strangely sad, nostalgic feel, reminding <b>ourselves</b> <b>of</b> memories from yesteryear". He commended Madonna's vocals calling it as the song's [...] "premier sound" [...] and adding that the way [...] "she sings and captures the melancholic melody is heartbreaking [...] it's one of her finest ever ballads." [...] Encyclopedia Madonnica writer and journalist Matthew Rettenmund noted in the book that the song's rise {{to the top of the}} charts was aided by its [...] "honest delivery and aching sense of loneliness, regret and nostalgia for friendship lost." ...|$|E

2500|$|Maimonides (1134–1204) {{says that}} as sins cannot be taken off one’s head and {{transferred}} elsewhere, the ritual is symbolic, enabling the penitent to discard his sins: “These ceremonies are of a symbolic character and serve to impress man with a certain idea and to lead him to repent, as if to say, ‘We have freed <b>ourselves</b> <b>of</b> our previous deeds, cast them behind our backs and removed them from us as far as possible’.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the next}} 30 years, Jewish composers in Palestine began to seek new rhythmic and melodic modes that would {{distinguish}} their {{songs from the}} traditional European music they had been brought up on. Leaders of this musical movement were Matityahu Shelem ("VeDavid Yefe Eynaim", [...] "Shibbolet Basadeh"), Yedidia Admon ("Shadmati"), and others. [...] These composers sought to imitate the sounds of Arabic and other Middle Eastern music. [...] They used simple harmonies, and preferred the natural minor to melodic and harmonic minors used by European music. [...] They especially eschewed the interval of the augmented second, part of the [...] "gypsy minor" [...] scale used typically in klezmer music. [...] "Its character is depressing and sentimental", wrote music critic and composer Menashe Ravina in 1943. [...] "The healthy desire to free <b>ourselves</b> <b>of</b> this sentimentalism causes many to avoid this interval." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lucas {{continues}} to advocate {{the use and}} understanding of PrEP {{in an effort to}} end the AIDS epidemic. In September 2015 he created his first public-service announcement where he explains the importance of PrEP. In September 2015 he followed up with his original Out.com writing by saying that PrEP works, and the backlash against the medication's use needs to stop. Lucas wrote the following in his column: [...] "Despite all the attempted distractions, the focus must remain on the simple message in the new study: If you take PrEP, you will not get HIV. Period. It is time to wake up, stop the endless debating, and take action. The war against HIV rages on, and when scientists actually win a battle, we must avail <b>ourselves</b> <b>of</b> the powerful weapon they have developed."

2500|$|Maimonides {{noted that}} the {{scapegoat}} that was sent into the wilderness in [...] served as an atonement for all serious transgressions {{more than any other}} sin-offering of the congregation. Maimonides explained that as it thus seemed to carry off all sins, the scapegoat was not accepted as an ordinary sacrifice to be slaughtered, burned, or even brought near the Sanctuary. Rather, it was removed as far as possible from the community. Maimonides wrote that {{there is no doubt that}} sins cannot actually be carried like a burden, and taken off the shoulder of one being to be laid on that of another being. But the ceremonies of the scapegoat were symbolic, and serve to impress upon people the need to repent, as if to say, we have freed <b>ourselves</b> <b>of</b> our previous deeds, have cast them behind us, and removed them as far as possible.|$|E
2500|$|Also in April 1815 was John Taylor Coleridge's {{review for}} the British Critic, which read, [...] "This {{is the first}} time that we have had an {{opportunity}} of paying Mr. Southey the attention which he deserves; and we avail <b>ourselves</b> <b>of</b> it gladly [...] Mr. Southey is eminently a moral writer; to the high purpose implied in this title, the melody of his numbers, the clear rapidity of his style, the pathetic power which he exercises over our feelings, and the interesting manner of telling his story, whether in verse or prose, are all merely contributive." [...] The review concluded: [...] "here is plenty of sword and dagger, war-horse and chariot, a bugle or two, some little love, several beauties, and even a marriage in prospectu, with all the other ingredients of a 'charming poem.' If any one doat so desperately on 'love and glory,' that this does not content him, we are very sorry, but we cannot honestly recommend Don Roderick to his attention." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nine U.S. {{states have}} issued {{commemorative}} or affinity license plates for the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV) {{as a result}} of a national campaign for approval of [...] plates commemorating the Confederate States of America.

Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans allowed states to remove the Confederate flag from plates finding that the plates were speech by the state. The use of the Confederate Battle Flag and other Confederate symbols on the plates has stirred controversy but Jay Barringer, commander of the Maryland Division of Sons of Confederate Veterans countered [...] "We're trying to divest <b>ourselves</b> <b>of</b> the negative associations" [...] with the Confederate flag.
