5|$|Stem {{cell therapy}} is the {{replacement}} of damaged neurons by transplantation <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> into affected regions of the brain. Experiments have yielded mixed results using this technique in animal models and preliminary human clinical trials. Whatever their future therapeutic potential, stem cells are already a valuable tool for studying Huntington's disease in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The {{cell lines}} of origin {{are not fully}} understood. The {{mechanism}} may involve abnormal activation <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> In the proximal airways, stem cells that express keratin 5 {{are more likely to}} be affected, typically leading to squamous-cell lung carcinoma. In the middle airways, implicated stem cells include club cells and neuroepithelial cells that express club cell secretory protein. Small-cell lung carcinoma may be derived from these cell lines or neuroendocrine cells, and may express CD44.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Magnusson {{established}} the use <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> from bone marrow {{with the first}} surgical debridement of an OCD lesion. These cells typically differentiate into fibrocartilage and rarely form hyaline cartilage. While small lesions can be resurfaced using this form of surgery, the repair tissue tends to have less strength than normal hyaline cartilage and must be protected for 6 to 12 months. Results for large lesions tend to diminish over time; this {{can be attributed to}} the decreased resilience and poor wear characteristics of the fibrocartilage.|$|E

5|$|The KIT gene encodes {{a protein}} called steel factor receptor, which is {{critical}} to the differentiation <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> into blood cells, sperm cells, and pigment cells. A process called alternative splicing, which uses the information encoded in the KIT gene to make slightly different proteins (isoforms) for use in different circumstances, may impact whether a mutation on KIT affects blood cells, sperm cells, or pigment cells. Steel factor receptor interacts chemically with steel factor or stem cell factor to relay chemical messages. These messages are used during embryonic development to signal the migration of early melanocytes (pigment cells) from the neural crest tissue to their eventual destinations in the dermal layer. The neural crest is a transient tissue in the embryo that lies along the dorsal line. Melanocytes migrate along the dorsal line to a number of specific sites: near the eye, near the ear, and the top of the head; six sites along each side of the body, and a few along the tail. At these sites, the cells undergo a few rounds of replication and differentiation, and then migrate down and around the body from the dorsal aspect towards the ventral aspect and the limb buds.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{progress}} in <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> research is opening a new hope for cell therapy in regenerative medicine. Two breakthroughs {{were made in}} the <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> era, one, new discoveries in multipotentiality <b>of</b> adult <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> beyond the traditionally appreciated extent, and the other, establishment <b>of</b> pluripotent <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> from human embryo. In addition to the newly identified multipotentiality <b>of</b> adult <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> their ability to be trans-differentiated toward other tissue types (<b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> plasticity) as well as to migrate toward the site of tissue damage make adult <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> particularly attractive choice for <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> based therapy. <b>Stem</b> <b>cell</b> therapy for organ regeneration, therefore, could be approached from three distinct dimensions: first, direct differentiation <b>of</b> multi-potent <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> toward desired tissue types; secondly, regeneration of specific tissues through in vivo <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> plasticity, and lastly, by tissue-specific <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> from many types of organs. While each approach in <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> therapy poses distinctive limitations for their successful clinical applications, understanding regulatory mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> selfrenewal and their in vivo engraftment will mostly extend their medical efficacy <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> based therapy...|$|R

25|$|The {{existence}} <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in {{the adult}} brain has been postulated following the discovery {{that the process of}} neurogenesis, the birth of new neurons, continues into adulthood in rats. The presence <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in the mature primate brain was first reported in 1967. It has since been shown that new neurons are generated in adult mice, songbirds and primates, including humans. Normally, adult neurogenesis is restricted to two areas of the brain – the subventricular zone, which lines the lateral ventricles, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. Although the generation of new neurons in the hippocampus is well established, the presence of true self-renewing stem cells there has been debated. Under certain circumstances, such as following tissue damage in ischemia, neurogenesis can be induced in other brain regions, including the neocortex.|$|E
25|$|Further {{evidence}} {{comes from}} histology. Many tumors are heterogeneous and contain multiple cell types {{native to the}} host organ. Heterogeneity is commonly retained by tumor metastases.
