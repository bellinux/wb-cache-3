40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of phosphatidylglycerol and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol has been {{measured in the}} leaves of 27 species of higher plants from six families whose members differed in their degrees of chilling sensitivity. The content {{of high melting point}} fatty acids (represented by the sum of hexadecanoic, trans- 3 -hexadecenoic and <b>octadecanoic</b> <b>acids)</b> in phosphatidylglycerols varied little between members of the same plant family and was not obviously related to the relative chilling sensitivity of members of that family.

50|$|Members of P. annularis have cuticular {{hydrocarbons}} on {{the surface}} of their bodies that may serve as social recognition factors. These are composed of a complex mixture containing dimethylalkanes, n-alkanes, and monomethylalkanes. They are straight-chain and have methyl branches. The most common chemicals are 13,17- dimethylhentriacontane (18%) 3-methyl-nonacosane (13%), 3-methylheptacosane (11%), and n-heptacosane (8%). These serve to protect the wasps from dehydration. Their composition tends to be unique to each species of wasp. Hydrocarbons are present {{on the surface}} of workers, males, eggs, and larvae, as well as the surface of the nest and its pedicel. The lipids in the nest paper probably function in kin recognition among workers, while those in the pedicel likely deter predators. The free fatty acids of the pedicel induce the necrophoric response in ants, which causes them to avoid the pedicel rather than cross over it and prey on the nest’s inhabitants. In ants, the necrophoric response is defined as the behavior of recognizing dead colony members and carrying them to a refuse pile away from the nest. Adult males have the hydrocarbon compounds as the workers, but they are present in different amounts. In males, the most common component is 3-methylnonacosane (21%); in eggs, 3-methylnonacosane makes up 23% of lipids; in larvae 13- and 15-methylnonacosane are the most common (15%). Nest paper and pedicel have much larger hydrocarbon units, between 27 and 31 carbons in length. The pedicel also contains hexadecanoic acid and <b>octadecanoic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E

[...] While not involving G2A receptor binding, some actions of LPCs are G2A-dependent. For example, LPCs increase the bactericidal activity of rodent neutrophils, enhance hydrogen peroxide production in rodent neutrophils {{triggered by the}} ingestion of bacteria, stimulate the chemotaxis of human monocytes, and protect mice from the lethal effects of experimentally induced bacterial sepsis endotoxin. G2A may similarly {{be responsible for the}} activities of other phospholipids which, like LPC have not been shown to bind to G2A but still require G2A for certain of their activities viz., lysophosphatidylserine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine; these two lyso-phospholipids stimulate calcium signaling pathways in human neutrophils by a G2A dependent mechanism. [...] Furthermore, activated neutrophils greatly increase their surface membrane content of lysophosphatidylserine. In a mouse model, mouse neutrophils with increased levels of lysophosphatidylserine on their surface membrane due to cell activation or artificial addition showed an increase in there engulfment by mouse macrophages in vitro that was dependent on the expression of G2A in the macrophages and an increased rate of clearance in mice by a mechanism that was dependent on the expression of G2A by the mice. [...] Lysophosphotidylserine-laden neutrophils stimulated the G2A-dependent production the anti-inflammatory mediator, prostaglandin E2, by macrophages in the in vitro studies and inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, interleukin-6 and keratinocyte chemoattractant, in in vivo studies. Taken together, these studies suggest that G2A, activated by certain phospholipids contributes not only to the development but also the resolution of certain inflammation and innate immune responses in mice and may also do so in humans.|$|E

The technical potential of producing biofuel from a naturally occurring macroalgae was studied. The algae grow in Jamaica Bay, New York City, in contaminated water. The process consisted of mechanical harvesting, drying, grinding, and acid hydrolysis to form an algal sugar solution. Clostridium beijerinckii and C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum were used in an acetone butanol ethanol (ABE) fermentation to make butanol. Fermentation was followed by distillation Butanol concentrations during fermentation reached 4 g/L. The recovery of reducing sugars in the media was 0. 29 g butanol/g sugar. Feedstock with greater than 7 g/L butyric acid caused death of the butanol-producing bacteria. The kinetics of the production of 1 -octadecanol from <b>octadecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> was investigated in a liquid-phase trickle-bed reactor by hydrogenation. The primary reactions occurring in the reactor were the desired conversion of <b>octadecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> to 1 -octadecanol and the subsequent undesired conversion of 1 -octadecanol to octadecane. A series-parallel kinetics model first order in acid and zero order in hydrogen was developed to predict these two reactions. The activation energies of the reactions were 63. 7. 8 and 45. 6 kJ/mole, respectively. The conversion of <b>octadecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> and the selectivity to the desired product as functions of temperature, space velocity, and inlet <b>octadecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration were then estimated. The model predicts maximum productivity of 1 -octadecanol at higher temperatures and short residence times. Parametric plots show productivity to be ≥ 0. 48 g 1 -octadecanol/g <b>octadecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> at 566 oF and a 0. 1 h residence time. The model from the 1 -octadecanoic acid study was fitted to several sets of data for the hydrogenation of butyric acid to butanol in the temperature regime of 300 - 400 oF and pressures of 700 - 1000 psig. The model failed to accurately predict the final concentrations of 1 -butanol and butane. Reasons for this are suggested and future work to fix this problem is presented and discussed...|$|E

The two species utilize (Z) 11 -hexadecenal as the major pheromone component, which is produced by ∆ 11 desaturation of hexadecanoic acid. H. subflexa also produced (Z) 11 -hexadecanol and (Z) - 11 -hexadecenyl acetate via ∆ 11 desaturation.

40|$|Chlorine gas {{bleaching}} was {{a common}} method used in pulp industries. As a consequence, significant amounts of chlorine were discharged into surrounding aquatic ecosystems, affecting the biota. Chlorinated organic pollutants are formed when chlorine react with organic material. <b>Octadecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (stearic acid) {{is one of the}} most common saturated fatty acids in aquatic biota. In a naturally occurring process two and four chlorine atoms, respectively, are added over the unsaturated bonds, forming 9, 10 -dichloro <b>octadecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> and 9, 10, 12, 13 -tetrachloro <b>octadecanoic</b> <b>acid.</b> These are the chlorinated fatty acids (ClFA) under investigation in this Bachelor’s Thesis. The methodological framework for measuring ClFA is investigated in this essay. The scope is to evaluate the method of isolating and quantifying the compounds as described in Åkesson-Nilsson’s (2004) dissertation. The method includes: extraction of the lipid, transesterification (where the fatty acids, including the ClFAs, are separated from the lipids and transformed into their respective methyl esters through two methods, acidic catalysis with BF 3 or H 2 SO 4), separation (by solid phase extraction) and determination of ClFA concentration with a halogen specific detector (GC-XSD/MS). Furthermore, the scope is to investigate collected fish samples (from Norrsundet) with the abovementioned method. By making a dilution series with known concentrations it was possible to establish calibration curves, to give in an indication of the effectiveness of the method. BF 3 is in need of updating due to being experienced as slower and less stable than the H 2 SO 4 -method. However, it was concluded that the H 2 SO 4 -method was more effective on the standard samples and that the BF 3 -method was more effective on the fish lipid samples. In one of the lipid samples (lavaret transesterified with BF 3) a detectable concentration of 9, 10, 12, 13 -tetrachloro <b>octadecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> was discovered. Therefore, we question SEPAs decision to cancel investigations in Norrsundet. Our results could indicate that ClFAs are still an issue that could affect the ecosystem’s biota. ...|$|E

As the temperature of growth is lowered, the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids (hexadecenoic and octadecenoic acids) increases. The increase in content of unsaturated acids with a decrease in temperature of growth occurs in both minimal and complex media. Cells harvested in the stationary phase contained large amounts of cyclopropane fatty acids (methylenehexadecanoic and methylene <b>octadecanoic</b> <b>acids)</b> in comparison with cells harvested during exponential growth. Cells grown in a chemostat, limited by the concentration of ammonium salts, show a much higher content of saturated fatty acids (principally palmitic acid) than do cells harvested from an exponentially-growing batch culture in the same medium. Cells grown in a chemostat, limited by the concentration of glucose, show a slightly higher content of unsaturated fatty acids than cells from the corresponding batch culture. The results do not indicate a direct relation between fatty acid composition and minimal growth temperature...|$|R
40|$|Fatty acid (FA) {{composition}} of suet oil (SO) {{was measured by}} precolumn methylesterification (PME) optimized using a Box–Behnken design (BBD) and gas chromatography/electron ionization-quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC–EI-qMS). A spectral library (NIST 08) and standard compounds were used to identify FAs in SO representing 90. 89 % of the total peak area. The ten most abundant FAs were derivatized into FA methyl esters (FAMEs) and quantified by GC–EI-qMS; the correlation coefficient of each FAME was 0. 999 and the lowest concentration quantified was 0. 01 μg/mL. The range of recovery of the FAMEs was 82. 1 %– 98. 7 % (relative standard deviation 2. 2 %– 6. 8 %). The limits of quantification (LOQ) were 1. 25 – 5. 95 μg/L. The number of carbon atoms in the FAs identified ranged from 12 to 20; hexadecanoic and <b>octadecanoic</b> <b>acids</b> were the most abundant. Eighteen samples of SO purchased from Qinghai, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces of China were categorized into three groups by principal component analysis (PCA) according to {{the contents of the}} most abundant FAs. The results showed SOs samples were rich in FAs with significantly different profiles from different origins. The method described here can be used for quality control and SO differentiation {{on the basis of the}} FA profile...|$|R
40|$|Most {{probiotic}} lactobacilli {{adhere to}} intestinal surfaces, a phenomenon influenced by free polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The present study investigated whether free linoleic acid, γ-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, α-linolenic acid, or docosahexaenoic acid {{in the growth}} medium alters the fatty acid composition of lactobacilli and their physical characteristics. The most abundant bacterial fatty acids identified were oleic, vaccenic, and dihydrosterculic acids. PUFA, especially conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers and γ-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic, and α-linolenic acids, also were identified in lactobacilli. When lactobacilli were cultured in MRS broth supplemented with various free PUFA, the incorporation of a given PUFA into bacterial fatty acids was clearly observed. Moreover, PUFA supplementation also resulted in PUFA-dependent changes in the proportions of other fatty acids; major interconversions were seen in <b>octadecanoic</b> <b>acids</b> (18 : 1), their methylenated derivatives (19 :cyc), and CLA. Intermittent changes in eicosapentaenoic acid proportions also were noted. These results were paralleled by minor changes in the hydrophilic or hydrophobic characteristics of lactobacilli, suggesting that PUFA interfere with microbial adhesion to intestinal surfaces through other mechanisms. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that free PUFA in the growth medium induce changes in bacterial fatty acids {{in relation to the}} regulation of the degree of fatty acid unsaturation, cyclization, and proportions of CLA and PUFA containing 20 to 22 carbons. The potential role of lactobacilli as regulators of PUFA absorption may represent another means by which probiotics could redirect the delicate balance of inflammatory mediators derived from PUFA within the inflamed intestine...|$|R

In contrast, octadecenoic acids (oleic and elaidic <b>acid)</b> and <b>octadecanoic</b> (stearic) <b>acid</b> were inactive. Octadecadienoic acid-induced platelet activation was suppressed by the protein kinase C inhibitor, polymyxin B, {{but not by}} the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin. OAG-induced activation was potentiated by octadecadienoic acids present at non-stimulatory concentrations. Our data suggest that octadecadienoic acids and diacylglycerol synergistically induce platelet activation via protein kinase C. Furthermore, linolelaidic acid may provide a useful experimental tool to study fatty acid regulation of protein kinase C in intact cells...|$|R

Detailed compositional information was obtained from ‘bog butter’ lipids using high temperature gas chromatography (HTGC) and GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results indicate the degree to which ‘bog butters’ have undergone diagenetic alterations during burial to form an adipocere like substance, consisting predominately of hexadecanoic (palmitic) and <b>octadecanoic</b> (stearic) <b>acids.</b> GC-combustion-isotope ratio MS (GC-C-IRMS) was used to determine δ 13 C values for the dominant fatty acids present, revealing {{for the first time that}} ‘bog butters’ were derived from both ruminant dairy fats and adipose fats.

40|$|AbstractFirefly {{luciferase}} emits a {{burst of}} light when mixed with ATP and luciferin (L) {{in the presence of}} oxygen. This study compared the effects of long-chain n-alcohols (1 -decanol to 1 -octadecanol) and fatty <b>acids</b> (decanoic to <b>octadecanoic</b> <b>acids)</b> on firefly luciferase. Fatty acids were stronger inhibitors of firefly luciferase than n-alcohols. Myristyl alcohol inhibited the light intensity by 50 % (IC 50) at 13. 6 μM, whereas the IC 50 of myristic acid was 0. 68 μM. According to the Meyer-Overton rule, fatty acids are ∼ 12, 000 -fold stronger inhibitors than corresponding alcohols. The Lineweaver-Burk plot showed that myristic acid inhibited firefly luciferase in competition with luciferin, whereas myristyl alcohol inhibited it noncompetitively. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that an irreversible thermal transition occurred at ∼ 39 °C with a transition ΔHcal of 1. 57 cal g− 1. The ligand effects on the transition were evaluated by the temperature where the irreversible change is half completed. Alcohols decreased whereas fatty acids increased the thermal transition temperature of firefly luciferase. Koshland's transition-state theory (Science. 1963. 142 : 1533 – 1541) states that ligands that bind to the substrate-recognition sites induce the enzyme at a transition state, which is more stabilized than the native state against thermal perturbation. The long-chain fatty acids bound to the luciferin recognition site and stabilized the protein conformation at the transition state, which resisted thermal denaturation. Eyring's unfolding theory (Science. 1966. 154 : 1609 – 1613) postulates that anesthetics and alcohols bind nonspecifically to interfacial areas of proteins and reversibly unfold the conformation. The present results showed that alcohols do not compete with luciferin and inhibit firefly luciferase nonspecifically by unfolding the protein. Fatty acids are receptor binders and stabilize the protein conformation at the transition state...|$|R
