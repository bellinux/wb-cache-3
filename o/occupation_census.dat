50|$|Most Common Occupations: 1881 The 1881 <b>Occupation</b> <b>Census</b> {{report shows}} that the most common occupations for men were Works in Dress {{employing}} 118 people, Works in Food and Lodging (123), Works in House Furniture and Decorations (245), Works in Mineral Substances (408) and Works in Transport and Communications (423). 269 men had their occupations reported as 'Works in General or Unspecified Commodities' while 29 were Without Specified Occupations. Ten men were reported with Unknown Occupations.The most common occupations for women at this time were Works in Food and Lodging employing 52 women, Works in Dress (158) and Domestic services or Offices (384). 484 Women were reported as Persons Without Specified Occupations while 1,172 were reported with Unknown Occupations.|$|E
50|$|As women {{entered the}} {{workforce}} in larger numbers since the 1960s, occupations have become segregated {{based on the}} amount femininity or masculinity presupposed {{to be associated with}} each <b>occupation.</b> <b>Census</b> data suggests that while some occupations have become more gender integrated (mail carriers, bartenders, bus drivers, and real estate agents), occupations including teachers, nurses, secretaries, and librarians have become female-dominated while occupations including architects, electrical engineers, and airplane pilots remain predominately male in composition. Based on the census data, women occupy the service sector jobs at higher rates than men. Women’s overrepresentation in service sector jobs, as opposed to jobs that require managerial work acts as a reinforcement of women and men into traditional gender roles that causes gender inequality.|$|E

5000|$|A {{bar graph}} {{can be seen}} on this page {{depicting}} the comparison between male and Female occupation statistics for Boyton in the year of 1881. One of the most recognisable features of the graph is the high proportion of females (44 specifically) that come under the 'unknown occupation' section. Reason for this may be that during the Victorian Era [...] "women’s work was not always accurately recorded within sources that historians rely on, due to much of women's work having been irregular, home-based or within a family-run business.". One other noticeable aspect of the occupational structure of Boyton in 1881 is the large proportion of males who worked in the agriculture sector, of the 61 males accounted for in the 1881 <b>occupation</b> <b>Census</b> for Boyton, 38 worked in agriculture. This may have been an issue for the Parish of Boyton in the late 19th century due to the occurrence of the agricultural depression (most probably linked to {{what is known as the}} long depression), with such a large proportion of Boyton's male population relying on agriculture, the [...] "series of wet summers, culminating in the wettest season in living memory in 1879 meant an alarmingly low yield in successive harvests". This downfall in crop yields and the resulting collapse in the agriculture sector may be accountable for the fall in Boyton's population towards the end of the 19th century (as visible in the population graph seen on the right hand side of this page).|$|E

The most popular occupation for males at this time, was 'Agriculture', with 208 males being employed. The least popular occupation for males was the 'Professionals' sector, with 1 male to 7 females. The majority of females came under the category of 'Unknown Occupation', indicating they may have been unemployed, along with 4 males.

In contrast, female earnings increase with within-couple age difference, but this is due to the fact that women with differently-aged spouses work more hours not because they command higher wages. We test for negative selection into differently-aged couples using three measures: average earnings per hour in <b>occupation</b> using <b>Census</b> data, cognitive skills assessments from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort (NLSY 79), and measures of physical appearance from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).

Results showed that mortality from ALS was higher in people who had medium or high ELF-MF exposure in both censuses (HR 1. 55 (95 % CI 1. 11 - 2. 15)), but closer to unity for electrical shocks (HR 1. 17 (95 % CI 0. 83 - 1. 65)). When both exposures were included in the same model, the HR for ELF-MF changed little (HR 1. 56), but the HR for electric shocks was attenuated to 0. 97.
