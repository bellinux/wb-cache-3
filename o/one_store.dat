40|$|The {{realization}} of an all-optical transistor where one 'gate' photon controls a 'source' light beam, is a long-standing goal in optics. By stopping a light pulse in an atomic ensemble contained inside an optical resonator, we realize a device in which <b>one</b> <b>stored</b> gate photon controls the resonator transmission of subsequently applied source photons. A weak gate pulse induces bimodal transmission distribution, corresponding to zero and one gate photons. <b>One</b> <b>stored</b> gate photon produces fivefold source attenuation, {{and can be}} retrieved from the atomic ensemble after switching more than one source photon. Without retrieval, <b>one</b> <b>stored</b> gate photon can switch several hundred source photons. With improved storage and retrieval efficiency, our work may enable various new applications, including photonic quantum gates, and deterministic multiphoton entanglement.

2500|$|In 1901, George Gilman died {{without a}} will, {{starting}} {{a legal battle}} among his numerous heirs. The senior Hartford stepped into the battle by asserting that, in 1878, Gilman gave him half of the company in an unwritten partnership agreement. Evidence provided to the court established that Hartford received half of A's profits starting in 1878 and that the company's leases were in his name. The heirs realized that without Hartford, the firm would quickly become unprofitable. Therefore, in 1902 they agreed to a settlement where A was to be incorporated, with $2.1 million in assets. Under this agreement, the Gilman heirs received $1,250,000 in preferred shares at 6% interest, while Hartford received $700,000 in common stock and {{the remainder of the}} preferred shares. This gave Hartford control of the voting stock. Over several years, Hartford was able to repurchase the preferred shares from the Gilman heirs. [...] A opened an average of <b>one</b> <b>store</b> every three weeks. A nine-story headquarters and warehouse was built in Jersey City; it later expanded to include a manufacturing plant and bakery.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{incorporated}} as Model Aircraft (Bournemouth) Ltd on 8 November 1937, {{the company}} started with <b>one</b> <b>store</b> in Brighton in the 1930s. When this was sold after about 40 years {{under the same}} ownership, the store was bought {{in order to be}} [...] "a showroom for the importers of many prestige model ranges". Following success at this store, the new owners then began to purchase other shops, in Crawley, Eastbourne, Guildford and Maidstone, and brand them as Model Aerodrome. During the mid-90s a computerised stock control system was implemented, and in 1995 and 1996 respectively, the company opened stores in Croydon and Plymouth. In March 1999, after the opening of their eighth branch in Bluewater, Kent, the company expanded its range to include Scalextric and Corgi products, and with this expansion of their product line, changed their name to Modelzone. They then eventually acquired a number of stores formerly owned by the Beatties chain of model shops (which had closed when its parent company, ERA Group, placed it into administration).|$|E
2500|$|Alan Baddeley's {{theory of}} working memory has yet another aspect to which memory {{can be stored}} short term. [...] The visuo-spatial sketchpad is this store that holds visual {{information}} for manipulation. [...] The visuo-spatial sketchpad {{is thought to be}} its own storage of working memory in that it does not interfere with the short term processes of the phonological loop. [...] In research, it has been found that the visuo-spatial sketchpad can work simultaneously with the phonological loop to process both auditory and visual stimuli without either of the processes affecting the efficacy of the other. [...] Baddeley re-defined the theory of short-term memory as a working memory to explain this phenomenon. [...] In the original theory of short-term memory, it is understood that a person only has <b>one</b> <b>store</b> of immediate information processing which could only hold a total of 7 items plus or minus two items to be stored in {{a very short period of}} time, sometimes a matter of seconds. [...] The digit-span test is a perfect example of a measurement for classically defined short-term memory. Essentially, if one is not able to encode the 7 plus or minus two items within a few minutes by finding an existing association for the information to be transferred into long-term memory, then the information is lost and never encoded.|$|E
