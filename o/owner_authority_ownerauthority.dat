5000|$|Nemo dat quod non habet: The basic {{rule that}} a person who does not own {{property}} (e.g. a thief) cannot confer it on another except with the true <b>owner's</b> <b>authority</b> (i.e. as his agent). Exceptions to this rule include sales under statutory powers, and cases where the doctrine of estoppel prevents a legal owner from denying a seller's right to sell.|$|R
5000|$|In this case, Maxwell's {{argued that}} the first sale {{doctrine}} [...] protected their right to operate the viewing booths. That is, their activities didn't require the copyright <b>owner's</b> <b>authority.</b> However, the court regarded the defendants' [...] "first sale" [...] argument as merely another aspect of their main argument that their activities were not public. This was because Maxwell's always maintained the ownership of the videotapes and the fees paid by patrons were for showcasing operation, {{but not for the}} physical dominion over the tapes.|$|R

50|$|Res aliena, {{things that}} are not the {{property}} of the seller, may also be the subject of a valid sale. It is not essential that the seller be the owner of the goods at the time of delivery. The sale is not void simply because the seller is not the owner of the res vendita, and has sold it without the <b>owner's</b> <b>authority.</b> What is essential is that the seller delivers the property to the buyer, and ensures that his possession is not thereafter interfered with by anyone with better title. The buyer in such circumstances is protected (at the very least) by the residual warranty against eviction.|$|R
50|$|For works first {{published}} on or after March 1, 1989, {{use of the}} copyright notice is optional. Before March 1, 1989, {{the use of the}} notice was mandatory on all published works. Omitting the notice on any work {{first published}} from January 1, 1978 to February 28, 1989 could have resulted in the loss of copyright protection if corrective steps were not taken within a certain amount of time. Works published before January 1, 1978, are governed by the 1909 Copyright Act. Under that law, if a work was published under the copyright <b>owner’s</b> <b>authority</b> without a proper notice of copyright, all copyright protection for that work was permanently lost in the United States.|$|R

40|$|It is {{increasingly}} recognised that land-use change processes are {{the outcome of}} decisions made by individual actors, such as land <b>owners,</b> <b>authorities,</b> firms and households. In order to improve the theoretical basis of land-use modelling and to represent land-use changes in a behaviourally more realistic way, we are developing PUMA (Predicting Urbanisation with Multi-Agents), a fully fledged multi-agent system of urban processes.

The land conversion module describes farmers’, authorities’, investors’ and developers’ decisions to sell or buy land and develop it into other uses.

40|$|We {{develop a}} model of {{hierarchies}} based on the allocation of <b>authority.</b> A firm's <b>owners</b> have ultimate <b>authority</b> over a firm's decisions, but they have limited time or capacity to exercise this <b>authority.</b> Hence <b>owners</b> must delegate <b>authority</b> to subordinates. However, these subordinates also have limited time or capacity and so further delegation must occur. We analyze the optimal chain of command given that different agents have different tasks: some agents are engaged in coordination and others in specialization. Our theory throws light {{on the nature of}} hierarchy, the optimal degree of decentralization, and the boundaries of the firm. ...|$|R

40|$|Intelligent {{mobile phones}} {{equipped}} with camera are {{very popular in}} human daily lives now. Face verification running on mobile phone provides not only a tool for protection of <b>owner’s</b> <b>authority</b> but also an approach for verification from a distance. The combination of biometrics and telecommunication technologies possesses broad application potentials in information exchanges. However, {{there are also some}} critical issues needed solving. Usually the processing power and memory size of a mobile phone system are limited, and the acquisition images are suffered from the illumination changes. Based on the invariant property of the ratio of illumination at a pixel to its surrounding neighbor illuminations, an illumination normalization technique was analyzed and adapted to the mobile system. A dedicated scheme composed with special wavelets called Gab features was proposed for representation of human faces. The number of Gabor nodes was effectively reduced by an optimization processing. A mobile based face verification system was developed and embedded in Lenovo ET 980 mobile phone. The experiments testing on FERET fafb dataset show that the performance of this system is quite well...|$|R

In addition, governments are forbidden from being members of the FSC and their only engagement with FSC is as land <b>owners.</b> The <b>authority</b> of the FSC is determined by the approval of external audiences, such as environmental NGOs.|$|R
