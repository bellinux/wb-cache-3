50|$|As in Acquisition, the {{defenders}} have assets which the attackers may destroy {{to take away}} their SL and PL abilities until they are repaired. These assets are located between the cooling towers and the lettered objectives. Taking down the AAA will again allow the attacking SLs and PLs to call in their abilities, and will unlock the forward spawns located between {{the defenders}}' bunkers and the cooling towers. In addition to Squad Leaders (16 per faction, per domination game) and Platoon Leaders (4 per faction), Domination introduces the Officer In Charge (OIC) leadership position. This is the highest ranking leadership position in the game, and each is assigned to lead his 128 players to Domination victory. <b>OICs</b> have very powerful abilities that can affect spawning rates of the defenders and replenish or block the abilities of SLs and PLs.

40|$|In this paper, an Ontology {{inference}} {{cloud service}} (<b>OICS)</b> with auto-scaling capability is designed and implemented for the CNC machine tool industry. The <b>OICS</b> is a knowledge-based cloud manufacturing system, {{and is used}} to recommend machine tools and cutting tools based on the Ontology inference techniques. Three core functional modules: the Ontology inference module, the VMT (Virtual Machine Tool) module, and the request filtering module, are developed to allow multiple users to perform inference service, and verify the recommended machine tools or cutting tools via VMT simulations. The <b>OICS</b> is implemented and hosted in a cloud virtual machine, called a worker. Furthermore, the worker controller (WCR), is designed to automatically adjust the number of virtual machines to provide users splendid service quality. Finally, we deploy the developed <b>OICS</b> to a public cloud platform, namely Windows Azure, to conduct integrated tests. Testing results of a case study physically applying the <b>OICS</b> to a machine tool factory show that the <b>OICS</b> can successfully recommend suitable machine tools and cutting tools for machining tasks, and support multiple users in a reasonable performance.

Vienna: WU Vienna; ICOPER. [contributors: Joris Klerkx, Michael Derntl, Jad Najjar, Bernd Simon, Gonzalo Parra, Bram Vandeputte, Jose Luis Santos, Robert John Robertson, Anh Vu Nguyen-Ngoc, Philipp Prenner, Gytis Cibulskis, Evaldas Karazinas, Andres Franco, Israel Gutiérrez Rojas, Derick Leony, Mikael Karlsson, Henning Eriksson, Martin Sillaots, Aili Madisson, Pjotr Savitski, Jacek Bubak, Elisabetta Parodi, Paolo Tenerini, Michele Dicerto, Roland Klemke, Marion Gruber, Stefaan Ternier, Sören Unruh, Birgit Schmitz, Patrick Pekczynski, Daniel Müller, Johannes Götzinger, Franz Müller, Fredrik Paulsson, Jenny Gray, Jukka Purma, Susanne Neumann, Natalie Masrujeh, Michael Aram, Andreas Mulley, Franz Penz, Bernd Simon, Gustaf Neumann]In {{the context}} of the ICOPER project, the Open ICOPER Content Space (<b>OICS)</b> has been defined as the umbrella combining a set of specialised interconnected repositories, content and tools, as a test bed for the specifications and standards {{that are part of the}} ICOPER Reference Model (IRM). The <b>OICS</b> has been conceived as an infrastructure for sharing educational resources, with sophisticated services for publication, enrichment, search and retrieval. Additionally the <b>OICS</b> provides the services for the management of learning outcome profiles. This deliverable documents the final status of the <b>OICS</b> as with end of January 2011. For the 1 st generation of the <b>OICS,</b> described in D 1. 1, we had concentrated on building an infrastructure for harvesting and aggregating content provided by members of the consortium. We are now able to use this infrastructure as the underlying framework for implementing prototypical interfaces that allow learners and learning facilitators to engage in processes of outcome based learning. This deliverables starts with describing the types of shareable educational resources that the <b>OICS</b> deals with and documents the data models implemented by the OICS: for users and groups, for repositories and collections, for learning content and instructional models, for learning outcomes, for achievement profiles and for learning opportunities. These data models have been defined in cooperation with other ICOPER work packages, mainly 2 and 3. For learning content and instructional models, we chose the LOM standard as base, since it provides the most complete set of attributes for describing educational properties of an object. The main challenge consisted in defining, implementing and validating an application profile (AP), which would allow us to capture information about learning content and instructional models needed in {{the context of}} processes of outcome-oriented education: The main features of the ICOPER LOM AP that extend the base LOM standard allow  to capture the relationships between instructional models;  to distinguish between different types of comments;  to link instructional models to learning outcome definitions;  to define the type of shareable educational resource according to the ICOPER terminology;  and to provide the packaging format of a learning design. Several technical challenges were met during the implementation of the ICOPER LOM AP, e. g. with respect to validating constraints for vocabularies, implementing persistent, stable and resolvable identifiers, and transforming custom formats used by content providers. In order to make the <b>OICS</b> content accessible from those environments where learning processes are implemented (learning management systems, personal learning environments and social networks), we have defined a Middle Layer API following the design principles of a Service Oriented Architecture. We argue how following these principles allowed us to achieve important quality attributes like interoperability, scalability, reliability, configurability and testability. We present a comprehensive, documentation for the Middle Layer API and three alternative bindings that are optimized for specific client requirements. Section 5 is dedicated to a series of Integration Mini Case Studies which together present the main achievements of WP 1 :  inclusion of six different sources for learning outcome definitions totalling 3, 781 distinct resources;  integration of 19 content providers totalling around 80, 000 resources, providing more than 17, 500 documented hours of instructional content;  experimental implementation of the Metadata for Learning Opportunities (MLO) specification and import of course catalogues from two universities;  implementation of <b>OICS</b> related functionality into 14 different client environments jointly covering a complex workflow of outcome-oriented education including the definition of learning outcomes, the authoring of instructional models, the delivery of learning designs through a learning management system and learners‘ management of learning needs, achievements and assessment records.  <b>OICS</b> search functionality has been integrated into the ICOPER project website. It allows searching and retrieving of all types of shareable educational resources and display of a user‘s achieved learning outcomes. The problems solved during the development of the <b>OICS</b> infrastructure, and some results of the end user evaluation of the <b>OICS</b> client applications lead us to formulate a set of recommendations (Section 7) that are grouped with respect to the development life cycle phase they address. We have learnt that the following key factors need to be taken into account during the design of a brokerage infrastructure for educational resources:  maintenance of consistent technical information through a registry service;  development of an interface specification through a managed community process that takes into account the requirements of different client contexts;  definition of an application profile and validation of all ingested resources;  user perception of relevancy, copyright and privacy;  integration of repository services with social networks which increasingly become part of educational processes. For the setup of the infrastructure, end-user evaluation showed that quantity and quality of content are most relevant for users. For a successful deployment of the infrastructure, we recommend the use of testing environments and monitoring services and of a service capable of managing persistent and unique identifiers for resources. The complete <b>OICS</b> infrastructure is made available as Open Source software. Installation instructions are provided on the ICOPER web site. The <b>OICS</b> infrastructure has been successfully transferred into a different context within the German SpITKom project as described in Section 6. 2. ICOPE...|$|E
40|$|Background: With several efforts {{being made}} by key {{stakeholders}} {{to bridge the gap}} between beneficiaries and their having full access to free supplies, frequent stock-out, pilfering, collection of user fees for health commodities, and poor community engagement continue to plague the delivery of health services at the primary health care (PHC) level in rural Nigeria. Objective: To assess the potential in the use of telecommunication technology as an effective way to engage members of the community in commodity stock monitoring, increase utilization of services, as well as promote accountability and community ownership. Methods: The pilot done in 8 PHCs from 4 locations within Nigeria utilized telecommunication technologies to exchange information on stock monitoring. A triangulated technique of data validation through cross verification from 3 subsets of respondents was used: 160 ward development committee (WDC) members, 8 officers-in-charge (<b>OICs)</b> of PHCs, and 383 beneficiaries (health facility users) participated. Data collection made through a call center over a period of 3 months from July to September 2014 focused on WDC participation in inventory of commodities and type and cost of maternal, neonatal, and child health services accessed by each beneficiary. Results: Results showed that all WDCs involved in the pilot study became very active, and there was a strong cooperation between the <b>OICs</b> and the WDCs in monitoring commodity stock levels as the <b>OICs</b> participated in the monthly WDC meetings 96 % of the time. A sharp decline in the collection of user fees was observed, and there was a 10 % rise in overall access to free health care services by beneficiaries. Conclusion: This study reveals the effectiveness of mobile phones and indicates that telecommunication technologies can play an important role in engaging communities to monitor PHC stock levels as well as reduce the incidence of user fees collection and pilfering of commodities (PHC) level in rural communities...|$|E
40|$|The phenomenon, channel segregates (CS) as {{a result}} of gravity-driven flow due to density {{contrast}} occurred in the solid-liquid mushy zones 1 during solidification, often causes the severe destruction of homogeneity and even some fatal damages. Investigation on its mechanism sheds light on the understanding and controlling of the formation of solidifying metals,earth's core, igneous rock and sea ice. Until now, it still remains controversial what composes the density contrasts and, to what extent, how it affects channel segregates. Here, we show that in experimental 500 kg and 100 ton commercial cast steel ingots CS originates from oxide Al 2 O 3 /MnS impurity clusters (<b>OICs)</b> initially nucleated from the oxide (Al 2 O 3) particles, which induce an extra flow due to sharp density contrast between clusters and melt. The results uncover that, as <b>OICs</b> enrich and grow, their driven flow becomes stronger than the traditionally recognized inter-dendritic thermo-solutal convection, dominating the subsequent opening of the channels. This study extends the classical macrosegregation theory, highlights a significant technological breakthrough to control CS, and could quickly yield practical benefits to the worldwide manufacture of over 50 million tons of ingots, super-thick slab and heavy castings annually, as well as has general implications for the elaboration of other related natural phenomena.
