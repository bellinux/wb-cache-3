5|$|Brodie's {{research}} was enlarged and critiqued by other students of Mormonism, most notably Dale L. Morgan (1914–1971), {{who became a}} lifelong friend, mentor, and sounding board. Brodie finally completed her biography <b>of</b> <b>Smith</b> in 1944, and it was published the following year by Knopf, when the author was thirty.|$|E

5|$|Destruction of the {{newspaper}} provoked a strident call to arms from Thomas C. Sharp, editor of the Warsaw Signal and longtime critic <b>of</b> <b>Smith.</b> Fearing an uprising, Smith mobilized the Nauvoo Legion on June 18 and declared martial law. Officials in Carthage responded by mobilizing their small detachment of the state militia, and Governor Thomas Ford appeared, threatening to raise a larger militia unless Smith and the Nauvoo city council surrendered themselves. Smith initially fled across the Mississippi River, but shortly returned and surrendered to Ford. On June 23, Smith and his brother Hyrum rode to Carthage to stand trial for inciting a riot. Once the Smiths were in custody, the charges were increased to treason.|$|E
5|$|Detectives also {{investigated}} {{the death of}} a woman who had been a colleague <b>of</b> <b>Smith</b> at the Rainbow. Patricia Lynott, a divorced mother of two from Ireland who had moved to Birmingham, had been found dead in her flat in October 2000. Police had not treated the death as suspicious, but after they discovered her connection to Smith, her body was exhumed for a second post mortem. This proved to be inconclusive, and in January 2003 a coroner's jury in Birmingham recorded an open verdict after hearing that the cause of her death could not be determined.|$|E
5|$|For much of {{its early}} life, the school {{consisted}} only of Nathan Smith and a small class of students, operating in borrowed space at Dartmouth College. Students <b>of</b> <b>Smith</b> were educated as apprentices, and received a Bachelor of Medicine degree upon graduation. Like Dartmouth College as a whole, the medical school had continual funding shortages. As time passed, however, the popularity of both the medical instruction and the basic sciences taught at the school drew undergraduates and training physicians alike. Soliciting funds {{from the state of}} New Hampshire, Smith was able to obtain medical equipment and, by 1811, a dedicated physical plant for the school.|$|E
5000|$|Membership {{was around}} 3,000 for many years, but grew rapidly under the {{leadership}} of John Thomson in the 1910s. He focused on mergers with smaller unions, bringing in the Combined <b>Smiths</b> <b>of</b> Great Britain and Ireland, the Co-operative Society <b>of</b> <b>Smiths,</b> the National United Society <b>of</b> <b>Smiths</b> and Hammermen, and the United <b>Smiths</b> Trade Union <b>of</b> Ireland. [...] This brought membership up to 13,500 by 1915, and made it the largest union of blacksmiths in the country, ahead of the Amalgamated Society <b>of</b> <b>Smiths</b> and Strikers.|$|R

40|$|Zadie Smith’s novel On Beauty {{confirms}} that the fiction of the second generation Caribbean diaspora has indeed arrived on the international scene, if indeed any confirmation was required after the phenomenal success <b>of</b> <b>Smith’s</b> first novel White Teeth. The status <b>of</b> <b>Smith’s</b> fiction in the Euro-American academy, {{which is also the}} setting of On Beauty, encourages an analysis of disciplinarity and institutionalization.

5|$|Having {{previously}} {{played football}} for Mitchell Main {{in the winter}} of 1912–13, Kilner played as a right-back for Preston North End F.C. while posted to Preston during the war. The team won promotion from the Second Division in 1915, and took their place in the First Division when league football resumed in 1919. Sometimes playing under the name <b>of</b> <b>Smith</b> to avoid detection (although it is not certain why he did so), Kilner's first certain appearance for the team was in September 1918. It is unclear how often he represented the club.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007, {{shortly after}} Brown {{retired from the}} Army, he joined the board of {{directors}} for Aurora Flight Sciences, which specializes in the scientific and military applications of robotic aircraft and aerospace vehicles. Brown is the president and founder of his own consultation firm, Tier 4 Consulting. He is an advisor to the Patriot Defense Group, LLC,a defense and intelligence contracting company that directly supports the training requirements of the defense and intelligence communities. He serves on {{the board of directors}} for the Special Operations Warrior Foundation, and the board of directors for The Protective Group, a company which specializes in developing composite armor for personnel, vehicles and aircraft. He is a senior advisor to the CEO <b>of</b> <b>Smith</b> & Wesson.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} <b>of</b> <b>Smith</b> beyond what she writes {{of herself in}} the preface. She spent her life working as a cook or {{housekeeper}} in wealthy households, and unlike Elizabeth Raffald who left service to run her own shop, continued in that profession despite the success of her book. It is possible that she worked at Beaulieu Abbey, Hampshire. She is critical of cookery books written by men who conceal their secrets, preventing readers from using their recipes successfully.|$|E
50|$|Also in 1996, Essman {{created his}} first special live event, {{a tribute to}} the {{greatest}} living makeup artist, Dick Smith. Created at the Beverly Garland's Holiday Inn in North Hollywood, the event was decorated with original posters <b>of</b> <b>Smith's</b> films and was attended by 40 <b>of</b> <b>Smith's</b> closest protégés, friends, and colleagues and included film footage <b>of</b> <b>Smith's</b> work, interviews, and tributes to Smith by all in attendance. In 1998, Essman created a 30-minute highlights video of the event, currently available on Amazon.|$|R
50|$|In 1942, {{three years}} after August Derleth founded Arkham House {{for the purpose of}} {{preserving}} the work of H.P. Lovecraft, Derleth published the first of several major collections <b>of</b> <b>Smiths</b> fiction, Out <b>of</b> Space and Time (1942). This was followed by Lost Worlds (1944). The books sold slowly, went out of print and became costly rarities. Derleth published five more volumes <b>of</b> <b>Smiths</b> prose and two of his verse, and at his death in 1971 had a large volume <b>of</b> <b>Smiths</b> poems in press.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>Smiths</b> {{stories were}} {{published}} in six hardcover volumes by August Derleth under his Arkham House imprint. For a full bibliography to 1978, see Sidney-Fryer, Emperor of Dreams (cited below). S.T. Joshi is working with other scholars to produce an updated bibliography <b>of</b> <b>Smiths</b> work.|$|R
5|$|Malhotra {{returned}} to the Wolf Pack the following season after failing to make the Rangers' roster out of training camp. With New York deep at the centre position, his AHL assignment was predicated on him learning to play wing. He received numerous call-ups to New York and finished the 2000–01 campaign with 11 points over 28 games in the AHL and 12 points over 50 games in the NHL. The season also marked a management change as Glen Sather took over as general manager, marking the departure <b>of</b> <b>Smith,</b> who had drafted Malhotra and regarded him as untradeable during his tenure.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to {{civilian}} life, Agnew resumed his legal studies, and secured {{a job as a}} law clerk with the Baltimore firm <b>of</b> <b>Smith</b> and Barrett. Until now, Agnew had been largely apolitical; his nominal allegiance had been to the Democratic Party, following his father's beliefs. The firm's senior partner, Lester Barrett, advised Agnew that if he wanted a career in politics he should become a Republican. There were already many ambitious young Democrats in Baltimore and its suburbs, whereas competent, personable Republicans were scarcer. Agnew took Barrett's advice; on moving with his wife and children to the Baltimore suburb of Lutherville in 1947, he registered as a Republican, though he did not immediately become involved in politics.|$|E
5|$|Parslow started 2013–14 {{in and out}} of the team, {{but when}} {{returning}} to the starting line-up for a 2–1 home defeat to Mansfield Town on 14 September 2013 was handed the captain's armband in the absence <b>of</b> <b>Smith.</b> He established himself in the centre of defence alongside McGurk, and retained the armband when Smith was recalled into the team. However, he sustained knee ligament damage when colliding into advertising hoardings as he sliced an attempted clearance during York's 2–1 defeat away to Southend on 23 November 2013. The injury ruled him out for the rest of the season, in which he had made 16 appearances. In his absence, York reached the play-offs with a seventh-place finish in League Two, although they were beaten 1–0 on aggregate by Fleetwood Town in the semi-final.|$|E

5|$|Production on the Smith Guns {{began in}} late 1941, but {{problems}} with their manufacture meant {{that it was not}} until mid-1942 that the first batch were delivered to the Home Guard; by the beginning of 1943, a total of 3,049 Smith Guns had been issued to Home Guard units. Production problems also affected the ammunition for the weapons; a delay in manufacturing anti-tank ammunition meant that each weapon was only supplied with six or seven rounds. A number <b>of</b> <b>Smith</b> Guns were also issued to regular army units tasked with guarding airfields. Soon after issue a malfunction causing an explosion resulting in the death of Corporal Maynard of 2819 Squadron, RAF Regiment. Similar incidents followed and all Smith Guns were withdrawn from RAF Regiment units in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Smith, {{a philosopher}} who forged the new {{discipline}} of economics, is, by contrast, depicted in contemporary attire, showing {{his concern for}} the practical matters of economic activity, a gown draped over his shoulder retains the connection to philosophy and academia. Smith's economic ideas are also encoded into the statue: the plough behind him represents the agrarian economics he supplanted, the beehive before, {{is a symbol of}} the industry he predicted would come. His hand, resting on a globe, is obscured by the gown: a literal presentation of Smith's famous metaphor of the invisible hand. The life-and-a-half size statue <b>of</b> <b>Smith,</b> is cast in bronze from a plaster model by the sculptor and was unveiled in 2008. It was funded by private subscriptions organised by the Adam Smith Institute.|$|E
5|$|The colour of the {{spore print}} is brownish, with pink, reddish, or rosy tints. Spores are {{somewhat}} fuse-shaped, smooth, and measure 11–17 by 3–5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 18–25.6 by 7.0–10.2µm. Cystidia {{on the walls}} of the tubes (pleurocystidia) are fuse-shaped with a central swelling, thin-walled, and have granular contents. They possess sharp to tapered tips, and have overall dimensions of 36–44 by 8.0–11.0µm. On the pore edges, the cheilocystidia are similar in shape to the pleurocystidia, measuring 24.8–44.0 by 7.3–11.0µm. The hymenium <b>of</b> <b>Smith</b> and Thiers's variety uliginosus, when mounted in Melzer's reagent, shows reddish globules of pigment measuring 2–8µm that appear in the hyphae and throughout the hymenium, and a large (8–12µm) globule in the pleurocystidia.|$|E

5|$|The {{rebellion}} {{took place}} {{a few months}} after the founding of the Anti-Slavery Society, and had a strong impact on Britain. Although public sentiment initially favoured the colonists, it changed with revelations. The abolitionist debate which had flagged, was galvanised by the deaths <b>of</b> <b>Smith</b> and the 250 slaves. The Martial law in Demerara was lifted on 19 January 1824. In Demerara and Berbice, there was considerable anger towards the missionaries that resulted in their oppression. Demerara's Court of Policy passed an ordinance giving financial assistance to a church that was selected by plantation owners in each district. The Le Resouvenir chapel was seized and taken over by the Anglican Church.|$|E
5|$|The signing <b>of</b> <b>Smith,</b> {{along with}} the youth policy adopted by Somerset's new first-team coach, Mark Garaway, meant that Burns had limited {{opportunities}} in 2005; he played nine first-class and eight List A matches during the season, and did not appear for the first team after July. He scored an early-season century, hitting eleven boundaries {{on his way to}} 107 runs against Warwickshire in the totesport League, but only scored 63 runs across his remaining seven one-day matches. As a result of his lack of first-team action, he opted to retire from first-class cricket {{at the end of the}} 2005 season. In all, he scored 7,648 first-class runs at an average of 32.68, and 4,802 List A runs at 25.81. He also took 68 first-class wickets and 58 in List A cricket.|$|E
5|$|Van der Byl {{had been}} elected unopposed to the new House of Assembly for Gatooma/Hartley and {{remained}} a close associate <b>of</b> <b>Smith,</b> becoming Vice-President of the 'Republican Front' (later renamed the Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe). At the 1985 general election the boundaries for the White Roll seats were altered and Van der Byl fought in Mount Pleasant, opposing Chris Andersen. Andersen had broken with the Rhodesian Front to sit as an Independent and became Minister of State for the Public Service in Robert Mugabe's government. Van der Byl lost the election heavily, polling only 544 votes to 1,017 for Andersen and 466 for a third candidate. The Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe still controlled the election of ten white Senators and Smith agreed to elect Van der Byl {{to one of the}} Senate seats.|$|E
50|$|In a {{paperback}} edition released a year later, Nugent used a new afterword {{to respond to}} his critics, revealing that his publisher had given him an option of two deadlines: either on the first anniversary <b>of</b> <b>Smith's</b> death, or on the release date <b>of</b> <b>Smith's</b> posthumous album From a Basement on the Hill.
