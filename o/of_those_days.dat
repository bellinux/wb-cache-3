5|$|The {{sadness of}} the harsh {{conditions}} <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>days</b> is {{captured by the}} simple epitaph on the gravestone of James Myers who is buried in the Methodist Cemetery at Yeadon behind the Town Hall. James was a married man just 22 years old who 'died by an accident in the Bramhope Tunnel on the 14th day of April, 1848'. Next to him lies the body of his 3 years old daughter who died two weeks later of some unspecified illness.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ginger was {{the second}} longest-lasting Atlantic {{hurricane}} on record. The eighth tropical cyclone and fifth hurricane of the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season, Ginger spent 27.25days as a tropical cyclone, lasting from September6 to October3. Twenty <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>days</b> (September 11 – September 30), Ginger was classified as a hurricane. The storm formed northeast of the Bahamas, {{and for the first}} nine days of its duration tracked generally eastward or northeastward while gradually strengthening to peak winds of 110mph (175km/h). On September14, Ginger slowed and turned to a general westward track, passing near Bermuda on September23. There, the hurricane produced gusty winds and high waves, but no damage.|$|E
5|$|On July 5, 2016, Manning {{was taken}} to a {{hospital}} after what media sources characterized as a suicide attempt. The following week, Manning confirmed through an attorney statement that she had attempted to end her own life. On July 28, 2016, the ACLU announced that Manning was under investigation and facing several possible charges related to her suicide attempt. She was not allowed to have legal representation at the disciplinary hearing for these charges. At the hearing, held on September 22, she was sentenced to 14 days in solitary confinement, with seven <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>days</b> suspended indefinitely. Manning emerged from solitary confinement on October 12, after serving seven days; she said that she was not given the opportunity to appeal the ruling before being placed in solitary.|$|E

25|$|However, {{because of}} the holiday rules, Rosh Hashanah cannot fall on a Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday, so if TM2 is one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>days,</b> Rosh Hashanah in year 2 is {{postponed}} by adding one day to year 1 (the second deḥiyyah). To compensate, one day is subtracted from year 2. It is to allow for these adjustments that the system allows 385-day years (long leap) and 353-day years (short ordinary) besides the four natural year lengths.|$|E
25|$|Broomfield has a {{semi-arid}} climate (Köppen climate classification BSk). The city {{seems to}} have a unique microclimate within the metro area.

In comparison, Denver sees just 31 days of 90°F (32°C) temperatures. Broomfield also experiences 8 fewer days of weather below 32°F (0°C) than Denver each year.

25|$|The Cornwall Railway was {{conceived}} because of fears that Falmouth would lose out, as a port, to Southampton. Falmouth had {{for many years}} had {{nearly all of the}} packet trade: dispatches from the Colonies and overseas territories arrived by ship and were conveyed to London by road coach. The primitive roads <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>days</b> made this a slow business and Southampton was developing in importance. The completion of the London and Southampton Railway in 1840 meant that dispatches could be taken on to London swiftly by train.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s the Czech {{poet and}} former Esperantist Ladislav Podmele (1920–2000), also known under his {{pseudonym}} Jiří Karen, worked {{for several years}} {{with a team of}} prominent interlinguists on an elaborate project, Mežduslavjanski jezik ("Interslavic language"). Among other things, they wrote a grammar, an Esperanto–Interslavic word list, a dictionary, a course and a textbook. Although none of those were ever published, the project gained some attention of linguists from various countries. Probably due to the political reality <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>days,</b> this language was primarily based on Russian.|$|E
25|$|There was {{an intense}} social {{activities}} on the islands with weekly meetings at the numerous clubs in the area. Weddings were celebrated either in the coastal villages, such as Campana or San Fernando, or in the island chapels. To facilitate religious service on the islands, a floating church to sail along the rivers was set up. As the service was rather expensive it was discontinued towards 1952. The bell tower is now exhibited at the Police Station in Paraná de las Palmas and Carapachay, as a remembrance <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{late night}} scenes caused {{issues with the}} cast. Garlan Wilde, a gaffer for the film, was injured during the scene between Brady and the Shape when he dropped a light and accidentally slit his wrists. He {{was rushed to the}} hospital. In addition, while filming the rooftop scene, Ellie Cornell cut her stomach open on a large nail while sliding down the roof, though she {{continued}} filming the scene despite losing a sizable amount of blood. During most of the night scenes, Donald Pleasence became so cold that he wore a hat for most of the scenes, unbeknownst to the crew. This caused over six hours of footage to be re-shot. The shoot lasted about 41 days and Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris were required to be on set for 36 <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
25|$|From 1975 to 1980 Harper {{worked with}} English {{musician}} and 'Black Sheep' member Andy Roberts sometimes performing as a duo. During this period, Harper spent considerable {{time in the}} United States and signed with the US division of Chrysalis Records, who released HQ under a different title – When an Old Cricketer Leaves the Crease – and with alternative artwork. Chrysalis considered the original Hipgnosis-designed album cover of Harper walking on water to be too offensive for an American release. Harper disagreed, but was given no choice by the label. Chrysalis also changed the title of Harper's next album, Bullinamingvase, to One <b>of</b> <b>Those</b> <b>Days</b> in England. In 1978, US Chrysalis reissued Harper's first five Harvest albums, only one of which (Flat, Baroque and Berserk) had been previously released in America.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half of the ninth century, the Slavic dialect spoken north of Thessaloniki, in the hinterlands of Macedonia, became the basis for the first written Slavic language, created by the {{brothers}} Cyril and Methodius who translated portions of the Bible and other church books. The language they recorded is known as Old Church Slavonic. Old Church Slavonic is not identical to Proto-Slavic, having been recorded at least two centuries after the breakup of Proto-Slavic, and it shows features that clearly distinguish it from Proto-Slavic. However, it is still reasonably close, and the mutual intelligibility between Old Church Slavonic and other Slavic dialects <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>days</b> was proved by Cyril and Methodius' mission to Great Moravia and Pannonia. There, their early South Slavic dialect used for the translations was clearly understandable to the local population which spoke an early West Slavic dialect.|$|E

25|$|Joffe {{was one of}} the Soviet delegates at the Genoa Conference in February 1922, an {{experience}} he described in a short book published later that same year. After the Soviet walkout, he was made ambassador to China, as the Soviet troubleshooter (or Kuznetsov) <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>days.</b> In 1923, Joffe signed an agreement with Sun Yat-Sen in Shanghai on aid to Kuomintang {{on the assumption that the}} latter would cooperate with Chinese Communists, presumably with Lenin's approval. While in China, Joffe traveled to Japan in June 1923 to settle Soviet-Japanese relations. The negotiations proved long and difficult and were aborted when Joffe became gravely ill and had to be sent back to Moscow. After a partial recovery, he served as a member of the Soviet delegation to Great Britain in 1924 and as Soviet representative in Austria in 1924–1926. In 1926 his declining health and disagreements with the ruling Bolshevik faction forced his semi-retirement. He tried to concentrate on teaching, but it also proved difficult due to his illness.|$|E
