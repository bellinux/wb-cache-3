The study explains the origins <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> in the nurse/patient encounter. This explanation broadens the thinking limits previously imposed by locating difficulty within the individual. Key elements of this explanation are: knowing the patient minimizes the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> in the encounter; and families, availability of supplies and equipment, who is working, and care space changes are contextual factors that contribute to the construction <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> in the nurse/patient encounter. Awareness of these findings has implications for the strategies nurses employ in difficult encounters...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Sudoku is a logic-based {{combinatorial}} puzzle game {{which people}} in different ages enjoy playing it. The challenging and addictive {{nature of this}} game has made it a ubiquitous game. Most magazines, newspapers, puzzle books, etc. publish lots of Sudoku puzzles every day. These puzzles often come in different levels <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> so that all people, from beginner to expert, can play the game and enjoy it. Generating puzzles with different levels <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> {{is a major concern}} of Sudoku designers. There are several works in the literature which propose ways of generating puzzles having a desirable level <b>of</b> <b>difficulty.</b> In this paper, we propose a method based on constraint satisfaction problems to evaluate the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> the Sudoku puzzles. Then we propose a hill climbing method to generate puzzles with different levels <b>of</b> <b>difficulty.</b> Whereas other methods are usually capable of generating puzzles with only few number <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> levels, our method can be used to generate puzzles with arbitrary number <b>of</b> different <b>difficulty</b> levels. We test our method by generating puzzles with different levels <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> and having a group of 15 people solve all the puzzles and recording the time they spend for each puzzle.

5|$|Proposals to {{establish}} a joint British airline, combining {{the assets of the}} British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British European Airways (BEA) were first raised in 1953 as a result <b>of</b> <b>difficulties</b> in attempts by BOAC and BEA to negotiate air rights through the British colony of Cyprus. Increasingly BOAC was protesting that BEA was using its subsidiary Cyprus Airways to circumvent an agreement that BEA would not fly routes further east than Cyprus, particularly to the increasingly important oil regions in the Middle East. The Chairman of BOAC, Miles Thomas, was in favour of merger as a potential solution to this disagreement and had backing for the idea from the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, Rab Butler. However, opposition from the Treasury blocked the proposal.|$|E

In late 2004, on the island, they debate whether to defect to the rival faction of {{survivors}} led by John Locke (Terry O'Quinn). Intercut throughout the episode, {{a series of}} off-island scenes show Sun about to give birth and Jin experiencing a series <b>of</b> <b>difficulties</b> {{in his efforts to}} reach the hospital with a gift of a stuffed panda. The ending shows that Jin's and Sun's scenes do not focus on the same birth; Jin's scenes are flashbacks to events before the plane crash, while Sun's are flashforwards to sometime after she escapes the island. A subplot follows Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) and Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) on board the Kahana, where they learn more about the freighter's mission and find somebody they once knew.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} {{consequence of}} the expedition was the establishment by Bruce, in Edinburgh, of the Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory, which was formally opened by Prince Albert of Monaco in 1906. The Laboratory served as a repository for the large collection of biological, zoological and geological specimens amassed during the Scotia voyages, and also during Bruce's earlier Arctic and Antarctic travels. It was also a base from which the scientific reports of the SNAE could be prepared, and it served as general headquarters where polar explorers could meet– Nansen, Amundsen and Shackleton all visited– and where other Scottish polar ventures could be planned and organised. Although Bruce continued to visit the Arctic for scientific and commercial purposes, he never led another Antarctic expedition, his plans for a transcontinental crossing being stifled through lack of funding. The SNAE scientific reports took many years to complete; most were published between 1907 and 1920, but one volume was delayed until 1992. A proposal to convert the Laboratory into a permanent Scottish National Oceanographic Institute failed to come to fruition and, because <b>of</b> <b>difficulties</b> with funding, Bruce was forced to close it down in 1919. He died two years later, aged 54.|$|E
5|$|After Denmark ceded Norway to Sweden in 1814, Aalborg {{lost its}} {{important}} {{role as the}} country's centre for Norwegian trade. Its former prosperity also suffered as a result <b>of</b> <b>difficulties</b> with the herring industry as the fish disappeared after the sea breached the Agger Tange (which had linked Thy {{with the rest of}} Jutland at the western end of Limfjord) in the 1825 North Sea storm. The after effects of the state bankruptcy in 1813 also contributed to widespread poverty in the city. In the mid-19th-century, Aalborg was overtaken by Aarhus as the largest city in Jutland. Towards the end of the 19th century there was however an upturn. In 1865, the pontoon bridge over Limfjord was completed, and in 1869, the railway reached the city with a railway bridge over the sound to Vendsyssel three years later. The harbour facilities were also improved, making Aalborg Denmark's second port. Aalborg became the country's main producer of tobacco products and spirits, followed in the 1890s by fertilisers and cement. By 1901, the population had increased to almost 31,500.|$|E
5|$|McConnel {{set about}} {{improving}} Bryn Eglwys {{to increase its}} output. He focused on providing rail transport for the isolated quarry, and in April 1864 he reached agreement with local landowners to purchase the land necessary to build a railway towards Tywyn and onwards to the port of Aberdyfi. Construction was well underway by July 1864. The standard gauge Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway was expanding rapidly from its base at Machynlleth, however, and in 1863 had reached Tywyn, so McConnel decided to build his line from the quarry to Tywyn, as the nearest point where slate could {{be transferred to the}} standard gauge railway. This was despite the line's initial isolation {{from the rest of the}} system because <b>of</b> <b>difficulties</b> in bridging the estuary of the Afon Dyfi to the south. An Act of Parliament (28 and 29Vict, cap cccxv) allowing the company to operate passenger trains as a public railway was given Royal Assent on 5 July 1865, and the company appointed James Swinton Spooner as engineer for the construction. He laid out plans for a relatively straight line climbing steadily from Tywyn to the quarry and work quickly got underway. By September 1866 construction had advanced to the point where the Board of Trade inspector Captain Henry Tyler could make an initial inspection and report.|$|E

5|$|Pierre-Simon Laplace {{independently}} {{developed and}} proposed a similar model in 1796 in his Exposition du systeme du monde. He envisioned that the Sun originally had an extended hot atmosphere throughout {{the volume of}} the Solar System. His theory featured a contracting and cooling protosolar cloud—the protosolar nebula. As this cooled and contracted, it flattened and spun more rapidly, throwing off (or shedding) a series of gaseous rings of material; and according to him, the planets condensed from this material. His model was similar to Kant's, except more detailed and on a smaller scale. While the Laplacian nebular model dominated in the 19th century, it encountered a number <b>of</b> <b>difficulties.</b> The main problem involved angular momentum distribution between the Sun and planets. The planets have 99% of the angular momentum, and this fact could not be explained by the nebular model. As a result, astronomers largely abandoned this theory of planet formation {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The divisional {{training}} exercise {{took place}} around Camp Mackall, North Carolina, and {{suffered from a}} number <b>of</b> <b>difficulties</b> and problems. Poor weather delayed {{the beginning of the}} exercise until the night of 25 September, and it was only then that the aircraft carrying the first three battalions of paratroopers could take off and attempt to drop the airborne troops on three separate drop zones. A combination of poor visibility, and a lack of sufficient training for the pilots of the transport aircraft, resulted in the paratroopers being dispersed widely when dropped. Only sixty-five percent of the airborne troops and equipment dropped on the first drop zone were ready for action ninety minutes later, and in the second drop zone the airborne troops were so scattered that by 10:00 the next morning the commander of the battalion only had control over twenty percent of his men. A similar number of paratroopers missed the third drop zone, although the majority were dropped in a relatively small area where they could gather. Further problems were encountered, as a plane crash killed eight paratroopers and four aircrew, and the glider-borne elements of the division due to land were delayed by poor weather. After the initial night, the exercise continued for a further three days and included a complex supply mission designed to test whether it was possible to supply an isolated battalion of airborne troops.|$|E
5|$|The road {{followed}} by Alboin to reach Italy {{has been the}} subject of controversy, as is the length of the trek. According to Neil Christie the Lombards divided themselves into migrational groups, with a vanguard scouting the road, probably following the Poetovio – Celeia – Emona – Forum Iulii route, while the wagons and most of the people proceeded slowly behind because of the goods and chattels they brought with them, and possibly also because they were waiting for the Saxons to join them on the road. By September raiding parties were looting Venetia, but it was probably only in 569 that the Julian Alps were crossed at the Vipava Valley; the eyewitness Secundus of Non gives the date as May 20 or 21. The 569 date for the entry into Italy is not void <b>of</b> <b>difficulties</b> however, and Jörg Jarnut believes the conquest of most of Venetia had already been completed in 568. According to Carlo Guido Mor, a major difficulty remains in explaining how Alboin could have reached Milan on September 3 assuming he had passed the border only in the May of the same year.|$|E

5|$|The island {{seems to}} have been held, in {{association}} with the local manors of Uphill and Christon, by the Bek family, who granted it to Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln. Although the mechanism is unclear, it next passed to the Berkeley family with Maurice de Berkeley, the second Baron Berkeley, holding it in 1315. The site was used again by warreners in the 14th and 15th centuries. They lived in one of the ruined priory buildings which was rebuilt. By 1453 the overlordship of the island was held by James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond, and in 1460 the advowson was exercised by Margaret Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury. In the years following, the ownership of a variety of estates, including Norton Beauchamp, to which Steep Holm was attached, was disputed. In the 16th century Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset took over, and then lost, large estates including Brean, to which Steep Holm was allied. The Seymour descendants recovered the estates, owning them into the 17th century, although the only activity on Steep Holm {{seems to have}} been the employment of gull watchers and fishermen. In 1684 the Norton Beauchamp estate was sold to Edward Ryder. It appears to have been auctioned by decree of the Court of Chancery 11years later in 1695, possibly because <b>of</b> <b>difficulties</b> in maintaining sea defenses along the Somerset coast; however, this {{seems to have been}} disputed in the light of outstanding mortgages. In 1699 the estates, including Steep Holm, were sold to Philip Freke of Bristol, whose descendants held it for the next 130 years. Freke's granddaughter married into the family of John Willes, who was Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas and Member of Parliament. During their ownership, probably around 1776, a new cottage was built on Steep Holm for fishermen. It was built using stones from the ruined priory. In 1830 the island was sold again, according to some sources this was to a cousin of John Freke Willes named William Willes; however, other sources suggest it was to a solicitor in Weston-super-Mare named John Baker.|$|E
