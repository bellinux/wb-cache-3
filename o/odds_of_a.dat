5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to traverse {{the asteroid belt}} was Pioneer 10, which entered the region on 16 July 1972. At the time there was some concern that the debris in the belt would pose a hazard to the spacecraft, but it has since been safely traversed by 12 spacecraft without incident. Pioneer 11, Voyagers 1 and 2 and Ulysses passed through the belt without imaging any asteroids. Galileo imaged 951 Gaspra in 1991 and 243 Ida in 1993, NEAR imaged 253 Mathilde in 1997, Cassini imaged 2685 Masursky in 2000, Stardust imaged 5535 Annefrank in 2002, New Horizons imaged 132524 APL in 2006, Rosetta imaged 2867 Šteins in September 2008 and 21 Lutetia in July 2010, and Dawn orbited Vesta between July 2011 and September 2012 and has orbited Ceres since March 2015. On its way to Jupiter, Juno traversed the asteroid belt without collecting science data. Due to the low density of materials within the belt, the <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> probe running into an asteroid are now estimated at less than one in a billion.|$|E

500|$|In August 2000, Mark Hunt, a {{politician}} from West Virginia, asked Boisselier to clone his late son, {{who had died}} as a child. Hunt paid Clonaid $500,000 and helped them rent a science laboratory from a school. Boisselier said that the laboratory would initially be used to clone cattle, {{before moving on to}} humans. She planned to use a number of Raëlian surrogates, who were willing to abort abnormal pregnancies, to bear clones; the high number of women would compensate for the low <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> healthy child for each implantation. In September 2000, Raël and Boisselier held a press conference with several aspiring surrogate mothers of clones. At the event, Boisselier announced the construction of a cloning laboratory and vaguely described Hunt, who wished to remain anonymous. Boisselier received significant media attention as an advocate of cloning. Some commentators initially accepted her work as a legitimate attempt at cloning; Margaret Talbot of the New York Times described her as a more credible spokesperson than Raël, projecting what she described as [...] "an air of cool, academic professionalism". Boisselier's striking physical appearance drew particular attention, and she developed an avant-garde, stylish reputation, contrary to popular images of scientists.|$|E

2500|$|In the 16th–19th centuries pion coiffé (capped or marked pawn) handicapping was {{sometimes}} used. The stronger player must checkmate {{with a particular}} pawn, which is usually marked {{at the start of}} play. The pawn cannot be promoted; [...] giving checkmate with any other pawn or piece loses the game. Pion coiffé is considered to be about equivalent to giving <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> queen. [...] Similarly, games have occasionally been played with a ringed piece, where a ring or band is placed around a particular piece, and the player giving odds must checkmate with that piece. This form of odds, along with pion coiffé, are very difficult for the odds-giver, who cannot allow the odds-receiver to sacrifice for the capped or ringed piece or pawn. For instance, in pion coiffé, after 1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5, Black already threatens to sacrifice the queen for the capped pawn if it is the a-, d-, or g-pawn, to play 3...Qe5+ followed by such a sacrifice if it is the b- or h-pawn, or to play 3...Qe4+ followed by a sacrifice if it is the c-pawn.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} the density of specialists and of the area-level percentage of highly educated individuals on the <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> consulting <b>a</b> specialist, and examined whether these variables could explain the observed urban/rural contrast in utilization of specialty care. STUDY DESIGN: The study sample, representative of the French population aged 18 - 75 years in 1999, comprised 12, 435 individuals. METHODS: Multilevel logistic models allowed us to investigate predictors <b>of</b> the <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> consulting <b>a</b> specialist occasionally, regularly and frequently over the previous 12 months. RESULTS: We observed a modest but significant clustering within areas of the utilization of specialty care, with higher levels of clustering for behaviours representing heavy consumption of care. After adjustment for individual factors, the <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> consulting <b>a</b> specialist were higher in larger cities compared with rural areas, but most of this effect was attributable to other area-level variables. These area-level effects were different in magnitude and nature among males and females. Among males, the <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> consulting <b>a</b> specialist increased with the area-level density of specialists. Among females, such an effect was not significant, but the <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> consulting <b>a</b> specialist increased with the area-level percentage of highly educated individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Further investigation is required to better understand the processes operating at the area level that were shown to affect healthcare utilization in a different way for males and females. Policies may be needed to address problems of geographical access to specialty care, as well as situations of overuse of specialty care without regular recourse to primary care...|$|R

This study profiled ACSC admissions for homeless patients. Methods Bivariate analyses and logistic regression were completed to investigate ACSC and non-ACSC admissions among homeless patients using the 2010 California State Inpatient Database. Results Homeless patients admitted for an ACSC were mostly male, non-Hispanic white, and on average 49. 9  years old. In the predictive model, the <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ACSC admission among homeless patients increased {{when they were}} black, admitted to the emergency department or transferred from another health facility.
