50|$|Working with Mao-Xi Zhang he is {{reported}} {{as having been}} the first to make <b>octanitrocubane</b> in 2000 or earlier. Because of its high density and highly strained C-C bonds <b>octanitrocubane</b> is a very powerful high explosive.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Octanitrocubane</b> (molecular formula: C8(NO2)8) {{is a high}} {{explosive}} that, like TNT, is shock-insensitive (not readily detonated by shock). [...] The <b>octanitrocubane</b> molecule has the same chemical structure as cubane (C8H8) except {{that each of the}} eight hydrogen atoms is replaced by a nitro group (NO2).|$|E
50|$|<b>Octanitrocubane</b> has a {{detonation}} velocity of 10,100 m/s, {{making it the}} fastest known explosive.|$|E
50|$|This enables {{engineers}} {{to determine the}} proper masses of different explosives when applying blasting formulas developed specifically for TNT. For example, if a timber-cutting formula calls for a charge of 1 kg of TNT, then based on <b>octanitrocubane's</b> RE factor of 2.38, it would take only 1.0/2.38 (or 0.42) kg of it {{to do the same}} job. Using PETN, engineers would need 1.0/1.66 (or 0.60) kg to obtain the same effects as 1 kg of TNT. With ANFO or ammonium nitrate, they would require 1.0/0.74 (or 1.35) kg or 1.0/0.42 (or 2.38) kg, respectively.|$|R
50|$|The R.E. {{factor of}} <b>octanitrocubane</b> is 2.38, {{making it the}} most {{effective}} chemical explosive known.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>octanitrocubane</b> is {{predicted}} {{to be one of}} the most effective explosives, the difficulty of its synthesis inhibits practical use. Philip Eaton's synthesis was difficult and lengthy, and required cubane (rare enough to begin with) as a starting point. As a result, <b>octanitrocubane</b> is more valuable, gram for gram, than gold. A proposed path to synthesis is the cyclotetramerization of the as yet undiscovered and presumably unstable dinitroacetylene.|$|E
50|$|<b>Octanitrocubane</b> {{is thought}} to have 20-25% greater {{performance}} than HMX (octogen). This increase in power is due to its highly expansive breakdown into CO2 and N2, {{as well as to the}} presence of strained chemical bonds in the molecule which have stored potential energy. In addition, <b>octanitrocubane</b> produces no water vapor making it less visible, and both the chemical itself and its decomposition products (nitrogen and carbon dioxide) are considered to be non-toxic.|$|E
50|$|Heptanitrocubane {{was first}} {{synthesized}} {{by the same}} team who synthesized <b>octanitrocubane,</b> Philip Eaton and Mao-Xi Zhang at the University of Chicago, in 1999.|$|E
50|$|Having {{high energy}} but kinetic {{stability}} makes cubane and its derivative compounds useful for controlled energy storage. For example, <b>octanitrocubane</b> and heptanitrocubane {{have been studied}} as high-performance explosives.|$|E
5000|$|... 4,4’-Dinitro-3,3’-diazenofuroxan (DDF) is a {{powerful}} experimental high explosive with performance {{comparable to that of}} other high-density high-explosives such as <b>octanitrocubane.</b> It is synthesised by oxidative couplingof 4-amino-3-(azidocarbonyl)furoxan followed by Curtius rearrangement and further oxidation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Octanitrocubane</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} by Philip Eaton (who {{was also the}} first to synthesize cubane in 1964) and Mao-Xi Zhang at the University of Chicago in 1999, with the structure proven by crystallographer Richard Gilardi of the United States Naval Research Laboratory.|$|E
5000|$|Heptanitrocubane {{is a new}} {{experimental}} {{high explosive}} based on the cubic eight-carbon cubane molecule and closely related to <b>octanitrocubane.</b> Seven of the eight hydrogen atoms {{at the corners of}} the cubane molecule are replaced by nitro groups, giving the final molecular formula [...]|$|E
5000|$|Octaazacubane is {{predicted}} to have an energy density (assuming decomposition into N2) of 22.9 MJ/kg, which is over 5 times the standard value of TNT. It has therefore been proposed (along with other exotic nitrogen allotropes) as an explosive, and {{as a component of}} high performance rocket fuel. [...] Its velocity of detonation {{is predicted}} to be 15,000 m/s, much (48.5%) more than <b>octanitrocubane,</b> the fastest known nonnuclear explosive.|$|E
50|$|As with <b>octanitrocubane,</b> {{not enough}} heptanitrocubane has been {{synthesized}} to perform detailed tests on its stability and energy. It is hypothesized to have slightly better performance than explosives such as HMX, the current high-energy standard explosive, based on chemical energy analysis. While in theory not as energetic as octanitrocubane's theoretical maximum density, the HNC {{that has been}} synthesized so far is a more effective explosive than any ONC that has been produced, due to more efficient crystal packing and hence higher density.|$|E
5000|$|Curtis employs an {{ever-increasing}} variety of Omnicannon shells for any possible situation. These include the following: Stun (that disorients with a blinding {{flash of light}} along with a deafening popping sound): Explosive/Incendiary (a high explosive charge accompanied by a blast of heat); <b>Octanitrocubane</b> (Earth's most powerful non-nuclear explosive that can breach enemy fortifications); Tear Gas; Armor Piercing Discarding Sabot (releases a solid sharpened rod of depleted uranium); Nanoacid (releases a swarm of armor-consuming nano-robots); Flame Retardant; HEAP (High Explosive Armor Piercing); Flechette (releases dozens of tiny razor-sharp darts); Anesthetic Flechette (releases darts coated with a fast-acting anesthetic drug); Bolo (releases a nylon-corded steel ball bolo to entangle opponents); Knockout gas (that renders anyone whoever inhales it unconscious for several minutes); Neural Net (releases a cohesive electrical field that painfully disrupts the nervous system of anyone it touches); Complex Polymer (a powerful adhesive that sticks to and immobilizes an opponent); and Cryonic (generates intense cold to place an opponent in suspended animation.).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The high densities and (strain-induced) enthalpies of {{formation}} of cage-type molecules have drawn {{attention to their}} polynitro derivatives as potential energetic materials. Several such compounds have been synthesized, including <b>octanitrocubane</b> and hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane. One {{that has not yet}} been prepared but has evoked continuing interest is 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetranitro- 2, 4, 6, 8 -tetraazacubane. Some years ago, {{on the basis of a}} very high estimated density (about 2. 19 g/cm 3), it was predicted to have detonation properties greatly superior to those of HMX. We have now used computational procedures developed since that time to reassess the expected detonation performance of this compound. We find: density, 1. 940 g/cm 3; solid phase enthalpy of formation at 298 K, 757 cal/g; detonation velocity, 9. 8 mm/μs; detonation pressure, 444 kbar; impact sensitivity, h 50 ~ 40 cm. These are all better than the corresponding values for HMX, but not by as much as had been estimated earlier...|$|E
40|$|The safe {{preparation}} and characterization (XRD, NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, DSC, mass spectrometry, sensitivities) {{of a new}} explosive dihydroxylammonium 5, 5 '-bistetrazole- 1, 1 '-diolate (TKX- 50) that outperforms all other commonly used explosive materials is detailed. While much publicized high-performing explosives, such as <b>octanitrocubane</b> and CL- 20, {{have been at the}} forefront of public awareness, this compound differs in that it is simple and cheap to prepare from commonly available chemicals. TKX- 50 expands upon the newly exploited field of tetrazole oxide chemistry to produce a material that not only is easily prepared and exceedingly powerful, but also possesses the required thermal insensitivity, low toxicity, and safety of handling to replace the most commonly used military explosive, RDX (1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazacyclohexane). In addition, the crystal structures of the intermediates 5, 5 '-bistetrazole- 1, 1 '-diol dihydrate, 5, 5 '-bistetrazole- 1, 1 '-diol dimethanolate and dimethylammonium 5, 5 '-bistetrazole- 1, 1 '-diolate were determined and presented. ...|$|E
