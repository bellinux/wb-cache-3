5|$|Human {{eyes have}} color receptors known as cone cells, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> three types.

5|$|A dwarf, in the Dungeons & Dragons (D) fantasy roleplaying game, is a {{humanoid}} race, one of {{the primary}} races available for player characters. The idea for the D dwarf comes from European mythologies and J. R. R. Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings (1954-1955), and has been used in D and its predecessor Chainmail since the early 1970s. Variations from the standard dwarf archetype of a short and stout demihuman are commonly called subraces, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> more than a dozen across many different rule sets and campaign settings.|$|E

In {{addition}} to this number, the association employs 198 full-time and part-time staff to support the work of its adult volunteers. Senior volunteers in The Scout Association are called 'Commissioners'. Every County/Area/Region and District is headed by a Commissioner {{who is responsible for}} ensuring the Districts/Groups under their jurisdiction meet the standards set by the association. They receive support from Regional Development Officers in England, who are employed by the Regional Development Service and deployed locally to help support the association's objectives. Commissioners in the other nations receive support from Field Commissioners, employed and directed differently. District Commissioners report to the County/Area/Regional Commissioner, who in turn report to the UK Chief Commissioner.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the general}} {{election}} in February 2011, and {{the election of the}} members of the 24th Seanad, only three political parties had the minimum 20 members of Oireachtas to nominate a candidate: Fine Gael (76 TDs and 19 senators), the Labour Party (37 TDs and 13 senators) and Fianna Fáil (19 TDs and 14 senators). Sinn Féin, the next largest party in the Dáil Éireann, have 14 TDs and 3 senators. For other candidates to be nominated, support from members of smaller parties, independents (<b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> currently 14 TDs and 11 senators) or excess members of the three larger parties was needed, or the support of four local authorities.|$|E
5|$|Genetics {{play a role}} in the {{development}} of COPD. It is more common among relatives of those with COPD who smoke than unrelated smokers. Currently, the only clearly inherited risk factor is alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (AAT). This risk is particularly high if someone deficient in alpha 1-antitrypsin also smokes. It is responsible for about 1–5% of cases and the condition is present in about 3–4 in 10,000 people. Other genetic factors are being investigated, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> likely to be many.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of a driven wheel, a torque must be applied to {{generate}} the locomotive force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many types, including electric, piston-driven, turbine-driven, pneumatic, and hydraulic. (Torque may also be provided by human power, as in {{the case of}} a bicycle.) In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of skeletal muscles, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food. Because these muscles are attached to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size.|$|E
5|$|Like the series, {{the game}} takes place over 24 hours {{and has the}} same start and end clocks for each hour, marking the start and end of {{each part of the}} game. The hours are broken down into 58 {{separate}} missions, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> three broad types, each described in further detail below. Some missions are objective based, while others have a time-restricted element. Each mission is graded out of 100 points, based on the quality of performance, number of objectives completed, shooting accuracy and so on. A grade of 90 points or higher rewards the player by unlocking some form of bonus feature, including three movies (interviews with cast about the game, TV promos), 98 images (wallpaper-like images of main characters) and 23 characters (3D models that the player can view).|$|E
5|$|Ritual {{scarification}} in Nri {{was known}} as Ichi <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> two styles; the Nri style, and the Agbaja style. In the Nri style, the carved line ran {{from the center of}} the forehead down to the chin. A second line ran across the face, from the right cheek to the left. This was repeated to obtain a pattern meant to imitate the rays of the sun. In the Agbaja style, circles and semicircular patterns are added to the initial incisions to represent the moon. These scarifications were given to the representatives of the eze Nri; the mbùríchi. The scarification's were Nri's way of honoring the sun that they worshiped and was a form of ritual purification.|$|E

5|$|Sheffield's {{museums are}} managed by two {{distinct}} organisations. Museums Sheffield manages the Weston Park Museum (a Grade II* listed Building), Millennium Galleries and Graves Art Gallery. Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust manages the museums dedicated to Sheffield's industrial heritage <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> three. Kelham Island Museum (located {{just to the}} North of the city centre) showcases the city's history of steel manufacturing. Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet (in {{the south of the}} city) is a Grade I Listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Shepherd Wheel (in the south-East of the city) is a former water-powered grinding workshop, Grade II listed and a Scheduled Ancient Monument.|$|E
5|$|The {{geographical}} {{isolation and}} recent glacial history of Shetland {{have resulted in}} a depleted mammalian fauna and the brown rat and house mouse are two of only three species of rodent present on the islands. The Shetland field mouse is the third and the archipelago's fourth endemic subspecies, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> three varieties on Yell, Foula and Fair Isle. They are variants of Apodemus sylvaticus and archaeological evidence suggests that this species was present during the Middle Iron Age (around 200 BC to AD 400). It is possible that Apodemus was introduced from Orkney where a population has existed since at the least the Bronze Age.|$|E
5|$|The mansion {{itself was}} {{originally}} constructed as a Federal-style {{home by the}} prominent family of iron masters; an 1895 remodeling transformed the structure {{with the addition of}} Victorian features. The mansion is constructed of locally quarried red sandstone, as are the outbuildings, which at one time numbered nearly 30. The grounds is also notable for its pre-1840 American formal garden, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> very few surviving.

5|$|The nest of the dusky woodswallow {{consists}} of twigs, roots {{and other similar}} foliage matted {{together to form a}} bowl shape, which is lined with grass. It is positioned safely, behind bark, and/or high in a tree branch, and sometimes in a hollowed out tree stump. The nest is made during the period from August to January, {{and with the help of}} several birds. The mated pair will then guard the nest, while others will help them take care of the babies. The female lays white eggs, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> usually no more than three or four. While the incubation period lasts for sixteen days, the amount of time taken for fledgling can be this long to around twenty days.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules and}} scoring in ski flying are mostly {{the same as}} they are in ski jumping, and events under the {{discipline}} are usually contested as part of the Ski Jumping World Cup season, but the hills (<b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> only five remaining, all in Europe) are constructed to a different standard in order to enable jumps of up to 66% longer in distance. There is also a stronger emphasis on aerodynamics and harnessing the wind, as well as an increased element of danger due to athletes flying much higher and faster than in ski jumping.|$|E
5|$|The true {{honey bees}} (genus Apis, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> seven currently-recognized species) are highly eusocial, and {{are among the}} best known of all insects.

There are 29 subspecies of one of these species, Apis mellifera, native to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Africanized bees are a hybrid strain of A. mellifera that escaped from experiments involving crossing European and African subspecies; they are extremely defensive.|$|E
