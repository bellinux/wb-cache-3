In the present study, a control strategy based on a power system auxiliary service for large-scale ESSs is described, in which the offset effect that occurs with multiple ESSs is demonstrated when smoothing wind power fluctuations in a distributed pattern. A quasi-automated generation control (QAGC) strategy is proposed for multiple ESSs, which satisfies the power system control requirements for electric power and relaxes the bottleneck to accommodate the wind power in the grid. This approach regulates the performance <b>of</b> <b>ESSs,</b> broadens the scale of wind power systems accepted by the grid, and optimizes the low-carbon benefits <b>of</b> <b>ESSs.</b>|$|R

40|$|Intermittent energy resources, {{including}} {{wind and}} solar power, continue to be rapidly added to the generation fleet domestically and abroad. The variable power of these resources introduces new levels of stochasticity into electric interconnections that must be continuously balanced {{in order to maintain}} system reliability. Energy storage systems (ESSs) offer one potential option to compensate for the intermittency <b>of</b> renewables. <b>ESSs</b> for long-term storage (1 -hour or greater), aside from a few pumped hydroelectric installations, are not presently in widespread use in the U. S. The deployment <b>of</b> <b>ESSs</b> would be most likely driven by either the potential for a strong internal rate of return (IRR) on investment and through significant benefits to system reliability that independent system operators (ISOs) could incentivize. To assess the potential <b>of</b> <b>ESSs</b> three objectives are addressed. (1) Evaluate the economic viability of energy storage for price arbitrage in real-time energy markets and determine system cost improvements for ESSs to become attractive investments. (2) Estimate the reliability impact of energy storage systems on the large-scale integration of intermittent generation. (3) Analyze the economic, environmental, and reliability tradeoffs associated with using energy storage in conjunction with stochastic generation. First, using real-time energy market price data from seven markets across the U. S. and the physical parameters <b>of</b> fourteen <b>ESS</b> technologies, the maximum potential IRR of each technology from price arbitrage was evaluated in each market, along with the optimal ESS system size. Additionally, the reductions in capital cost needed to achieve a 10 % IRR were estimated for each ESS. The results indicate that the profit-maximizing size <b>of</b> an <b>ESS</b> is primarily determined by its technological characteristics (round-trip charge/discharge efficiency and self-discharge) and not market price volatility, which instead increases IRR. This analysis demonstrates that few ESS technologies are likely to be implemented by investors alone. Next, the effects <b>of</b> <b>ESSs</b> on system reliability are quantified. Using historic data for wind, solar, and conventional generation, a correlation-preserving, copula-transform model was implemented in conjunction with Markov chain Monte Carlo framework for estimating system reliability indices. Systems with significant {{wind and solar}} penetration (25 % or greater), even with added energy storage capacity, resulted in considerable decreases in generation adequacy. Lastly, rather than analyzing the reliability and costs in isolation of one another, system reliability, cost, and emissions were analyzed in 3 -space to quantify and visualize the system tradeoffs. The modeling results implied that ESSs perform similarly to natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) systems with respect to generation adequacy and system cost, with the primary difference being that the generation adequacy improvements are less for <b>ESSs</b> than that <b>of</b> NGCC systems and the increase in LCOE is greater for ESSs than NGCC systems. Although ESSs do not appear to offer greater benefits than NGCC systems for managing energy on time intervals of 1 -hour or more, we conclude that future research into short-term power balancing applications <b>of</b> <b>ESSs,</b> in particular for frequency regulation, is necessary to understand the full potential <b>of</b> <b>ESSs</b> in modern electric interconnections.

Former low reliability rates and life-time are being dramatically improved {{in recent times}} due to the intensive research on battery and capacitor technologies. However, {{little research has been}} conducted on the optimization of railway system infrastructure by incorporating ESSs. This paper presents a method for designing the best possible deployment <b>of</b> <b>ESSs</b> in a Dcelectrified mass rapid transport system line by means of optimization, selecting number and location <b>of</b> <b>ESSs.</b> A detailed model of system load flow and energy storage devices for a given traffic scenario in a general DC railway system has been carried out, resulting in a MINLP optimisation model that minimises total energy consumption. Then, a linearization of load flow equations has been performed {{in order to get a}} fast-approximate solution of the system by converting the MINLP problem into a MIP one. This optimization method has been applied to a realistic railway system, yielding reasonable location and number <b>of</b> <b>ESSs</b> in the system. The error due to the approximation has been evaluated by comparing the results of the linear load flow against those of the non-linear load flow. The method has demonstrated to be a powerful tool to decide how many and where to place ESSs in a DC-electrified railway system. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
