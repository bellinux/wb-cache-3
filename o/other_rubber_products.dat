5000|$|While {{working at}} Goodyear, Spence altered the {{processes}} for vulcanization {{and the application}} of colored dyes to rubber. Traditionally, vulcanization was accomplished in air, with sulfur and other accelerators. [...] While observing devulcanization, Spence noticed that the decomposition products were dependent on the oxygen content in the system, and that, without oxygen, the rubber failed to devulcanize. Based on these observations, Spence developed an oxygen, sulfur, and accelerator free vulcanization process by using organic oxidizers such as quinones or organic peroxides. Spence's vulcanization process required placing the latex mixture in a pH 7 buffered solution, and applying an organic oxidizer agent to the mixture under an inert atmosphere of nitrogen.In addition to redeveloping the vulcanization process, Spence developed a method for applying dyes to raw rubber. Prior to Spence's method, the dyes were applied during the processing of the rubber. This proved too expensive and was limited by thermal decomposition of the dyes. Submerging the <b>rubber</b> <b>products</b> in an adsorbent bath of amine dye, sodium hydrate, sodium chloride, and sulfuric acid allowed for the dyes to be bound covalently to the rubber matrix. The amines in solution reacted with primary amines in the rubber matrix to form azo dyes on the rubber fibers. This methodology of dyeing rubber was found to be applicable to raw, vulcanized, and <b>other</b> manufactured <b>rubber</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract- With {{the recent}} {{increase}} {{and awareness of}} natural rubber latex protein allergies, {{it is very important}} for all health care workers to understand and recognize the need to decrease and/or eliminate latex exposure in the rubber gloves and <b>other</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>products</b> for those individuals who are allergic to natural rubber latex. This study is based on a series of Lowry method of protein analysis. The field latex was concentrated by centrifugation method. A laboratory scale latex centrifuge machine (model SPL- 100, Satio Separator Ltd, Japan) with a capacity of 5 liters was used for concentrating the latex. The process increased the solid content in rubber latex from 29 % to approximately 60 %, and also reduced the percentage of non-rubber content. The experimental results of UV spectrophotometer (UV- 2401 PC, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) showed that rubber films of higher TSC percentage got significant amount of water leachable protein. Furthermore, they showed different protein content for different dipping time in water. Another experiment was carried out for irradiated latex of different doses.
