For example, these can cause disruptive effects on endocrine systems; impair the reproductive system, and lower the immune system of individuals, leading to a higher number of deaths.

5|$|Marine mammal {{adaptation}} to an aquatic lifestyle varies considerably between species. Both cetaceans and sirenians are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate water dwellers. Seals and sea-lions are semiaquatic; they spend {{the majority of}} their time in the water, but need to return to land for important activities such as mating, breeding and molting. In contrast, both otters and the polar bear are much less adapted to aquatic living. Their diet varies considerably as well; some may eat zooplankton, others may eat fish, squid, shellfish, sea-grass and a few may eat other mammals. While the number <b>of</b> <b>marine</b> mammals is small compared to those found on land, their roles in various ecosystems are large, especially concerning the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>marine</b> ecosystems, through processes including the regulation of prey populations. This role in maintaining ecosystems makes them of particular concern as 23% <b>of</b> <b>marine</b> mammal species are currently threatened.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{research}} at Dalhousie {{has become a}} large focus of the university, {{with many of the}} university's faculty members involved in some form <b>of</b> <b>marine</b> research. Notably, Dalhousie is the headquarters of the Ocean Tracking Network, a research effort using implanted acoustic transmitters to study fish migration patterns. Dalhousie houses a number <b>of</b> <b>marine</b> research pools, a wet laboratory, and a benthic flume, which are collectively known as the Aquatron laboratory. Dalhousie is one of the founding members of the Halifax Marine Research Institute, founded on 2 June 2011. The institute, which is a partnership between a number of private industries, government, and post-secondary institutions, was designed to help increase the scale, quality, internationalization and impact <b>of</b> <b>marine</b> research in the region. In 2011, the university, along with WWF-Canada, created the Conservation Legacy For Oceans, which aimed at providing scholarships, funding, curriculum development, and work placements for students and academics dedicated to marine research, law, management, and policy making.|$|E

5|$|Chitinozoa (singular: chitinozoan, plural: chitinozoans) are a taxon of flask-shaped, organic walled marine microfossils {{produced}} by an as yet unknown animal. Common from the Ordovician to Devonian periods (i.e. the mid-Paleozoic), the millimetre-scale organisms are abundant {{in almost all}} types <b>of</b> <b>marine</b> sediment across the globe. This wide distribution, and their rapid pace of evolution, makes them valuable biostratigraphic markers.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} Jurassic, Europe was a dry, {{tropical}} archipelago {{at the edge}} of the Tethys Sea. The fine limestone in which the skeletons of Compsognathus have been found originated in calcite from the shells <b>of</b> <b>marine</b> organisms. Both the German and French areas where Compsognathus specimens have been preserved were lagoons situated between the beaches and coral reefs of the Jurassic European islands in the Tethys Sea. Contemporaries of Compsognathus longipes include the early avialan Archaeopteryx lithographica and the pterosaurs Rhamphorhynchus muensteri and Pterodactylus antiquus. The same sediments in which Compsognathus have been preserved also contain fossils of a number <b>of</b> <b>marine</b> animals such as fish, crustaceans, echinoderms and marine mollusks, confirming the coastal habitat of this theropod. No other dinosaur has been found in association with Compsognathus, indicating that these little dinosaurs might in fact have been the top land predator in these islands.|$|E
