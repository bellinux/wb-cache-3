25|$|The valvular {{event that}} causes such {{cavitating}} conditions to exist is the closing {{mechanics of the}} MHV. Several causes of cavitation relating to valve closure have been identified. Squeeze flow is cavitation that is said to occur as the <b>occluder</b> approaches the housing during closure and fluid is squeezed between the <b>occluder</b> and the valve housing causing a low pressure formation. Water hammer is cavitation caused by the sudden stop of the valve <b>occluder</b> as it contacts the valve housing. This sudden retardation of the fluid retrograde inertia is said to put the fluid under tension causing cavitation. Squeeze flow is said to form a cloud of bubbles at the circumferential lip of the <b>occluder</b> whereas water hammer {{is said to be}} seen as transient bubbles at the occlude housing.|$|E

25|$|The {{cavitation}} phenomenon {{can also}} be described using fluid mechanics. This can result from pressure oscillations, flow deceleration, tip vortices, streamline contraction, and squeeze jets. This last cause is the most contributive factor to cavitation. The squeeze jets are formed when the valve is closing and the blood between the <b>occluder</b> and valve housing is “squeezed” out to create a high-speed jet. This in turn creates intense vortices with very low pressures {{that can lead to}} cavitation.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a biologically-inspired model for partly <b>occluded</b> {{patterns}} is proposed. The model {{is based on}} the hypothesis that in human visual system <b>occluding</b> patterns {{play a key role in}} recognition as well as in reconstructing internal representation for a pattern’s <b>occluding</b> parts. The proposed model is realized with a bidirectional hierarchical neural network. In this network top-down cues, generated by direct connections from the lower to higher levels of hierarchy, interact with the bottom-up information, generated from the un-occluded parts, to recognize <b>occluded</b> patterns. Moreover, positional cues of the <b>occluded</b> as well as <b>occluding</b> patterns, that are computed separately but in the same network, modulate the top-down and bottom-up processing to reconstruct the <b>occluded</b> patterns. Simulation results support the presented hypothesis as well as effectiveness of the model in providing a solution to recognition of <b>occluded</b> patterns. The behavior of the model is in accordance to the known human behavior on the <b>occluded</b> patterns...|$|R

25|$|Soon after came tilting-disc valves. The first {{clinically}} available tilting disk valve was the Bjork-Shiley valve and {{has undergone}} several significant design changes since its introduction in 1969. Tilting disk valves {{have a single}} circular <b>occluder</b> controlled by a metal strut. They are made of a metal ring covered by an ePTFE fabric, into which the suture threads are stitched in order to hold the valve in place. The metal ring holds, by means of two metal supports, a disc which opens and closes as the heart pumps blood through the valve. The disc is usually made of an extremely hard carbon material (pyrolytic carbon), {{in order to allow}} the valve to function for years without wearing out. The Medtronic-Hall model is the most common tilting-disc design in the US. In some models of mechanical valves, the disc is divided into two parts, which open and close as a door.|$|E

[...] Impact wear usually occurs in the hinge regions of bileaflets, between the <b>occluder</b> and ring in tilting-discs, and between the ball and cage in caged-ball valves.

2500|$|Mechanical {{heart valves}} have been {{traditionally}} {{considered to be}} more durable in comparison to their bioprosthetic counterparts. [...] The struts and occluders are made out of either pyrolytic carbon or titanium coated with pyrolytic carbon, and the sewing ring cuff is Teflon (PTFE), polyester or dacron. [...] The major load arises from transvalvular pressure generated at and after valve closure, and in cases where structural failure does happen, it is usually {{as a result of}} <b>occluder</b> impact on the components.|$|E

Materials: twelve patients presenting with symptoms of lower limb ischaemia who had previously undergone infra-inguinal bypass surgery and in whom the bypass graft had <b>occluded.</b> These patients were treated by attempting subintimal angioplasty of the <b>occluded</b> native vessels. Results: there were seven technically successful procedures but after a median follow up of four weeks, only one case had persistent patency of the previously <b>occluded</b> segment.

40|$|Although 4 -month-olds {{perceive}} {{continuity of}} an object's trajectory through occlusion, {{little is known}} about the information specifying an <b>occluding</b> surface at this age. We investigated this in 3 experiments involving 84 participants. Testing the claim that 5 -month-olds are unable to perceive the Kanizsa figure as an <b>occluding</b> surface (Csibra, 2001), we demonstrated that 4 -month-olds perceived trajectory continuity behind this figure providing its horizontal extent was small. We demonstrated that the presence of visible <b>occluding</b> edges or occlusion of background was insufficient to specify an <b>occluding</b> surface but that their combination was sufficient. Thus, beyond object deletion and accretion, both visible <b>occluding</b> edges and occlusion of background are necessary for perception of <b>occluding</b> surfaces at this age...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{whether an}} agnosic {{patient with a}} deficit in early visual processing, HJA, completed <b>occluded</b> contours. We used matching tasks with stimuli composed of three superimposed or <b>occluded</b> shapes. Experiments 2 and 6 required superimposed or <b>occluded</b> shapes to be discriminated from distractors in which the position of one shape was changed. HJA was selectively impaired with <b>occluded</b> relative to superimposed shapes. His performance was affected by the spatial separation of the <b>occluded</b> contours rather than {{the area of the}} <b>occluded</b> surface. Experiments 3 and 5 required HJA to discriminate the central shape. Making <b>occluded</b> contours easier to compute (by reducing their spatial separation) facilitated discrimination of a central <b>occluded</b> shape (in the background), although it impaired discrimination of a central <b>occluding</b> shape (in the foreground). Free-choice shape judgements made to the central shape (Experiment 2) showed that HJA used both real and completed contours to segment foreground shapes inappropriately. When asked to copy overlapping shapes (Experiment 4), HJA drew in the <b>occluded</b> parts as if real contours were present, at least on some occasions. These drawings and a task requiring discrimination between real and <b>occluded</b> contours (Experiment 7), showed a tendency to continue contours inappropriately, an insensitiviy to junctions, and impaired integration of contours into more global shapes. The results suggest that <b>occluded</b> contours can be computed early on in visual processing, probably at the level where long-range mechanisms group collinear contour segments together. Our control experiment shows that HJA is not impaired in collinear contour grouping. These mechanisms are prior to processes in which contours are bound to shapes and in which foregroundbackground relationships between shapes are resolved. In visual agnosia, <b>occluded</b> contours can be computed even when there is impairment of both binding of contours to shapes and the computation of foreground-background relations in overlapping shapes...|$|R
2500|$|Percutaneous {{closure of}} an ASD is {{currently}} only indicated for {{the closure of}} secundum ASDs with a sufficient rim of tissue around the septal defect so that the closure device does not impinge upon the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, or the tricuspid or mitral valves.

5000|$|A pinhole <b>occluder</b> is an opaque disk {{with one}} or more small holes through it, used by ophthalmologists, orthoptists and optometrists to test visual acuity. The <b>occluder</b> is a simple way to focus light, as in a pinhole camera, {{temporarily}} removing the effects of refractive errors such as myopia. Because light passes only {{through the center of the}} eye's lens, defects in the shape of the lens (errors of refraction) have no effect while the <b>occluder</b> is used. In this way the ophthalmologist, orthoptist or optometrist can estimate the maximum improvement in a patient's vision that can be attained by lenses to correct errors of refraction. [...] This can be used to distinguish visual defects caused by refractive error, which improve when the <b>occluder</b> is used, from other problems, which do not. The pinhole <b>occluder</b> can also be used in testing visual acuity in mydriatic patients. In this case the pinhole <b>occluder</b> compensates for the inability to contract the iris assisting the eye in obtaining a retinal projection similar to that of a non-cycloplegic eye.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel method for {{handling}} <b>occluded</b> pixels in stereo images {{based on a}} probabilistic voting framework that utilizes a novel support-and-decision process. Occlusion handling aims to assign a reasonable disparity value to <b>occluded</b> pixels in the disparity maps. In an initial step, disparities and their corresponding supports at the <b>occluded</b> pixels are calculated using a probabilistic voting method using the disparities at visible pixels. In this way, the visible pixel information is propagated when the disparities and support at the <b>occluded</b> pixels are computed. The final disparities for <b>occluded</b> pixels are then computed through an iterative support-and-decision process to propagate the information inside the <b>occluded</b> pixel region.

40|$|According to the Norwegian cyclone model, {{whether a}} warm-type or cold-type <b>occluded</b> front forms de-pends upon which {{cold air mass}} is colder: the prewarm-frontal air mass or the postcold-frontal air mass. For example, a cold-type {{occlusion}} is said to occur when the <b>occluded</b> front slopes rearward with height because the prewarm-frontal airmass is warmer than the postcold-frontal airmass. This temperature difference and the resulting occluded-frontal structure in the Norwegian cyclone model {{is part of what}} is called the temperature rule. Paradoxically, no clear example of a rearward-sloping, cold-type <b>occluded</b> front has been found in the literature, even though the required temperature difference has been documented in several cases. This article presents the first documented, rearward-sloping, cold-type <b>occluded</b> front. This <b>occluded</b> front forms in a cy-clone over the North Atlantic Ocean on 3 – 5 January 2003 and is documented in model output from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Cross sections through the evolving cyclone show the <b>occluded</b> front forms as the less statically stable warm-frontal zone ascends over the more stable cold-frontal zone. Such a stability difference between the cold- and warm-frontal zones is consistent with a pre-viously published hypothesis that the less stable air is lifted by the more stable air to form <b>occluded</b> fronts, in disagreement with the temperature rule. Because warm-frontal zones and the cold air underneath tend to be more stable than cold-frontal zones and the postcold-frontal air, warm-type <b>occluded</b> fronts are much more common than cold-type <b>occluded</b> fronts, explaining why well-defined, rearward-sloping, cold-type <b>occluded</b> fronts are not common in the meteorological literature. 1...|$|R
40|$|The author {{reports on}} the {{visibility}} of spatial details located in those regions of a stereo pair which are seen by one eye only. In normal viewing, these regions correspond to areas of a scene which are <b>occluded</b> by nearer objects for one eye or the other-so called half <b>occluded</b> regions (or monocular regions).

If it were true, high spatial frequency components in half <b>occluded</b> regions could be reduced without impairment of the subjective image quality. A comparison test of the visual resolving power for spatially low-pass filtered and non-filtered patterns in half <b>occluded</b> regions was carried out.

40|$|The {{completion}} of partly <b>occluded</b> objects appears instantaneous and effortless, but empirically takes measurable time. The current study investigates how amount of occlusion affects the time course and mechanisms of visual completion. Experiment 1 used a primed-matching paradigm to determine completion times for objects <b>occluded</b> by various amounts. Experiments 2 and 3 used a dot-localization paradigm to probe completed contour representations for a qualitative shift above some spatial limit. The results demonstrate {{that time to}} completion rises with amount of occlusion. Nonetheless, the visual system can complete highly <b>occluded</b> objects, even when the occlusion renders visible contours nonrelatable. Furthermore, prolonged completion times for highly <b>occluded</b> objects do not result from a breakdown of low-level interpolation processes: The same contour completion mechanism operates on objects <b>occluded</b> by different spatial extents. The perception of objects is critical to one’s interpretation of the world. However, many of the objects that a person perceives are not fully specified by visual information because those objects <b>occlude</b> parts of themselves or are <b>occluded</b> by neighboring ob-jects.

40|$|This article {{develops}} the FACADE theory of 3 -D vision and figure-ground separation to explain data concerning how 2 -D pictures {{give rise to}} 3 -D percepts of <b>occluding</b> and <b>occluded</b> objects. These percepts include pop-out of <b>occluding</b> figures and amodal completion of <b>occluded</b> figures in response to line drawings, to Bregman-Kanizsa displays in which the relative contrasts of <b>occluding</b> and <b>occluded</b> surfaces are reversed, to White displays from which either transparent or opaque occlusion percepts can obtain, to Egusa and Kanizsa square displays in which brighter regions look closer, and to Kanizsa stratification displays in which bistable reversals of <b>occluding</b> and <b>occluded</b> surfaces occurs, and in which real contours and illusory contours compete to alter the reversal percept. The model describes how changes in contrast can alter a percept without a change in geometry, and conversely. More generally it shows how geometrical and contrastive properties of a picture can either cooperate or compete when forming the boundaries and surface representations that subserve conscious percepts. Spatially long-range cooperation and spatially short-range competition work together to separate the boundaries of <b>occluding</b> figures from their <b>occluded</b> neighbors. This boundary ownership process is sensitive to image T-junctions at which <b>occluded</b> figures contact <b>occluding</b> figures, {{but there are no}} explicit T-junction detectors in the network. Rather, the contextual balance of boundary cooperation and competition strengthens some boundaries while breaking others. These boundaries control the filling-in of color within multiple, depth-sensitive surface respresentations. Feedback between surface and boundary representations strengthens consistent boundaries while inhibiting inconsistent ones. It is suggested how both the boundary and the surface representations of <b>occluded</b> objects may be amodally completed, even while the surface representations of unocclucled objects become visible through modal completion. Distinct functional roles for conscious modal and amodal representations in object recognition, spatial attention, and reaching behaviors are discussed. Model interactions are interpreted in terms of visual, temporal, and parietal cortex. Model concepts provide a mechanistic neural explanation and revision of such Gestalt principles as good continuation, stratification, and non-accidental solution.
