40|$|Background Challenging {{behaviour}} {{of clients}} influences emotional wellbeing of staff; {{this in turn}} affects levels <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> engagement <b>and</b> avoidance within interactions with clients. The main goal {{of this study was}} to investigate to what extent levels <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> engagement <b>and</b> <b>staff</b> avoidance are related to challenging and desirable client behaviours and clients' initiatives for contact. Method Participants were 8 support <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> 3 clients. <b>Staff</b> <b>and</b> client behaviours were measured within moments of interaction in natural settings using systematic observational data. Results The results showed that general levels <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> engagement, avoidance, <b>and</b> client behaviours seem to be related. However, individual, sequential analyses do not support these relationships. Conclusions Future research should take a more individual <b>and</b> intrapersonal view <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> behaviour <b>and</b> staff–client interaction into account, in order to obtain a detailed and realistic image of individual patterns in interactions between support <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> clients.
