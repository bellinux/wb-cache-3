5|$|Grant, under protest, {{followed}} Johnson's order transferring Sheridan {{and another}} of the district commanders, Daniel Sickles, who had angered Johnson by firmly following Congress's plan.

5|$|Around {{the same}} time gay men were getting sick in the U.S., doctors in Paris, France, were {{receiving}} patients who were African <b>or</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> lived in Africa with the same symptoms as Americans. Parisian researchers Jean-Claude Chermann, Françoise Barre, Luc Montagnier, and doctor Willy Rozenbaum began taking biopsies of HIV-infected lymph nodes and discovered a new retrovirus. As a scientific necessity {{to compare it to}} the American version of HIV, French doctors representing the Pasteur Institute sent a colleague to the National Cancer Institute, where Robert Gallo was also working on the virus. The colleague switched the samples, Shilts reported, because of a grudge he had against the Pasteur Institute. Instead of Gallo comparing his samples with the French samples, he found the very same retrovirus as the French sample, putting back any new results in AIDS research for at least a year.|$|E
5|$|Benn {{continued}} his campaign outside Parliament. Within two years, though, the Conservative Government of the time, which had {{members in the}} same or similar situation to Benn's (i.e., {{who were going to}} receive title, <b>or</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> already applied for writs of summons), changed the law. The Peerage Act 1963, allowing lifetime disclaimer of peerages, became law shortly after 6pm on 31 July 1963. Benn was the first peer to renounce his title, doing so at 6.22pm that day. St Clair, fulfilling a promise he had made {{at the time of his}} election, then accepted the office of Steward of the Manor of Northstead, disqualifying himself from the House (outright resignation not being possible). Benn returned to the Commons after winning a by-election on 20 August 1963.|$|E

5|$|After Preston won an FA Cup {{match against}} Upton Park in 1884, the Londoners protested, seeking the result to be {{overturned}} due to professionalism in the Preston ranks. This sparked {{a series of}} events which threatened to split the FA. Under Sudell's instruction, Preston withdrew from the competition. Fellow Lancashire clubs Burnley and Great Lever followed suit. The protest gathered momentum, to the point where more than 30 clubs, predominantly from the north, announced that they would set up a rival British Football Association if the FA did not permit professionalism. At the FA conference called to discuss the issue, Sudell {{was a member of the}} committee. He argued passionately for the acceptance of professionalism, but met opposition from southern-based amateur clubs, who viewed sport solely as a pastime. Backed by figures such as the more moderate but influential William McGregor of Aston Villa, the advocates of professionalism won the day and secured its acceptance. However, each club was permitted to only pay players who had been born <b>or</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> lived within six miles of the home stadium for at least two years.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, German New Guinea was only lightly defended; even after all available reservists had reported for duty and the Melanesian police had been armed, the total strength was only 61German officers and non-commissioned officers, and about 240Melanesian police. To compound the defenders' problems, most of the Germans were reservists with either limited experience <b>or</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> {{served in the military}} many years earlier. The Bita Paka radio station itself was occupied by eight Germans and 60 Melanesians, under the command of Hauptmann (Captain) Hans Wuchert. Wuchert's force was assigned to defend against any hostile landing at a point near the coast, and was authorised to withdraw halfway between Toma and Bita Paka to Tobera if necessary, but only after demolishing the radio station. A company of 10Germans and 140Melanesians was also stationed at Herbertshöhe, commanded by Leutnant (Lieutenant) Mayer, while a squad of Melanesians at Toma under Leutnant Robert von Blumenthal ("Lord Bob") was charged with digging in and improving defences. Section outposts were established at various locations and monitored the coast from St. George's Channel to Rabaul. Despite the limits of manpower, such arrangements proved effective and the reconnaissance of the Australian Squadron on 12 August had been quickly detected, with German forces subsequently directed towards the coast to repel any invasion.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the award}} of the medal {{had to be}} applied for, it was not awarded posthumously. The {{next-of-kin}} of members {{who had been killed}} in action <b>or</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> died while on service therefore received no medal. The published medal roll shows that 5,252 medals were awarded to 5,156 individuals, which included 96 duplicate or triplicate awards. Nearly half of the awards, to 2,422 individuals, were for the Bechuanaland campaign.|$|E

25|$|When {{slavery was}} {{practiced in the}} United States, it was common for {{families}} to be separated through sale. Even during slavery, however, many African-American families managed to maintain strong familial bonds. Free African men and women, who managed to buy their own freedom by being hired out, who were emancipated, <b>or</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> escaped their masters, often worked long and hard to buy the members of their families who remained in bondage and send for them.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, George Craghead Gregory of Richmond was {{credited}} with discovering {{the foundation of the}} first brick statehouse (capitol) building, circa 1646, at Jamestown on the land owned by Preservation Virginia.

25|$|When {{writing the}} examination, {{candidates}} had {{to record the}} names and positions of their four great-grandfathers. The higher literary examination was restricted to those who either were already {{in a position of}} rank, <b>or</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> already passed the lower examination. The miscellaneous examinations were looked down upon by the yangban, and were generally restricted to the chungin class of hereditary technical workers. Criteria for the military examination varied, but over time it became open even to members of the lowest class (the cheonmin).|$|E

Eligibility for the award of the medal was subsequently extended to cover service in 1919 and 1920 in mine-clearing at sea as well as participation in operations in North and South Russia, the eastern Baltic region, Siberia, the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.|$|E
25|$|At {{the close}} of the Civil War, Dr. Howe entered into the work of the Freedmen's Bureau. His work with the Freemen’s Bureau served as an {{extension}} of his work as an abolitionist. It was the job of the Freedmen’s Bureau to help house, feed, clothe, educate and provide medical care to newly freed slaves in the South after the Civil War. In some instances, Bureau staff would also try to aid the freedmen to locate and reunite with relatives who had either fled north <b>or</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been sold away during slavery.|$|E

25|$|During the Korean War, the North Koreans {{developed}} {{reputation for}} severely mistreating {{prisoners of war}} (see Crimes against POWs). Their POWs were housed in three camps, according to their potential usefulness to the North Korean army. Peace camps and reform camps were for POWs that were either sympathetic to the cause <b>or</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> valued skills that could be useful {{in the army and}} thus these enemy soldiers were indoctrinated and sometimes conscripted into the North Korean army. The regular prisoners of war were usually very poorly treated. POWs in peace camps were reportedly treated with more consideration.|$|E
25|$|Central to Macquarie's {{policy was}} his {{treatment}} of the emancipists: convicts whose sentences had expired <b>or</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been given conditional or absolute pardons. By 1810 emancipists had outnumbered the free settlers, and Macquarie set the tone himself by appointing emancipists to government positions: Francis Greenway as colonial architect and Dr William Redfern as colonial surgeon. He scandalised settler opinion by appointing an emancipist, Andrew Thompson, as a magistrate, and by inviting emancipists to tea at Government House. In exchange, Macquarie demanded that the ex-convicts live reformed (Christian) lives. He required that former convicts regularly attend church services, and in particular, strongly encouraged formal Christian (Anglican) marriages.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 10th century, between the fall of Tang Dynasty and the rise of Song, there was brisk trading between the {{overseas}} world with the Fujian kingdom of Min and the rich Guangdong kingdom of Nan Han. Srivijaya undoubtedly benefited from this. Sometime around 903 CE, the Muslim writer Ibn Rustah was so impressed with the wealth of the Srivijayan ruler that he declared that one would not hear of a king who was richer, stronger <b>or</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> more revenue. The main urban centres of Srivijaya were then at Palembang (especially the Karanganyar site near Bukit Seguntang area), Muara Jambi and Kedah.|$|E
