40|$|What {{explains}} interest groups’ position alignments in the European Commission’s <b>open</b> <b>consultations?</b> The article {{argues that}} formal membership ties facilitate organisational coordination {{and the creation}} of lobbying coalitions among interest groups, which in turn affects their position alignments. This argument is supported by empirical evidence from five environmental consultations. Sharing a formal membership tie within an over-arching organisational structure has a stronger effect on position alignment than the fact of representing the same type of interest or having the same organisational form. Coordinated, coalition-based lobbying accounts to a significant extent for stakeholders’ position alignments in the EU <b>open</b> <b>consultations.</b> The ‘social’ embeddedness of lobbying has a direct effect on the advocacy strategies interest groups decide to employ during the early stages of EU policymakin...|$|R

Methods. An ecologic case-referent study design was used with data from the Netherlands Bureau of Statistics, the Ministry of Defence, the 1992 High-School Student Study, all of the youth health care departments in The Netherlands and relevant censuses. Results. Attention to mental and physical health and health compromising behaviour, either during screening, <b>open</b> <b>consultation</b> hours or during well-care visits seems to be ineffective and in some instances even detrimental to youth health. Of the 18 different outcome measurements, 5 were significantly negative and none were significantly positive. Conclusions. This four part study does not support the hypothesis that on a population level, the preventive activities of youth health care departments such as screening for scoliosis, (more) frequent well-care visits or offering <b>open</b> <b>consultation</b> hours at secondary schools, have a beneficial effect on prevention of (para) suicide, poor mental health, health compromising behaviour or obesity...|$|E

40|$|Background In {{this study}} {{the effect is}} {{assessed}} of (repeated) well-care visits and freely accessible consultation hours at secondary schools on the prevalence of adolescent health-compromising behaviour and later obesity. Methods An ecological case-referent study design was used with data from the Netherlands Bureau of Statistics, the Ministry of Defence, the 1992 High-School Student Study, all youth health care departments in The Netherlands and relevant census. Data from the High-School Student Study included 4569 students aged 12 - 18 years, of whom 4167 had answered all questions on health-compromising behaviour and eating habits. The data from the Ministry of Defence included 1004 cases with a body mass index greater than 27 {{of a total of}} 12 251 male conscripts. The census of 18 - and 19 -year-old males in the regions of the relevant youth health care departments served as referents. Results Except for the use of alcohol, the effect of more well-care visits was in all cases negative, and for the use of tobacco even significantly so [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 15, 95 per cent confidence interval (CI) = 1. 01 - 1. 33]. The availability of <b>open</b> <b>consultation</b> hours had an adverse effect on use of alcohol (OR = 1. 29, 95 per cent CI = 1. 11 - 1. 50). The OR for obesity in male conscripts showed an adverse effect of a greater number of well-care visits (OR = 2. 46, 95 per cent CI = 1. 74 - 3. 46) and the availability of <b>open</b> <b>consultation</b> hours (OR = 1. 97, 95 per cent CI = 1. 72 - 2. 25).
