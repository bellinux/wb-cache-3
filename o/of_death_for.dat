5|$|Japan {{suffers from}} a high suicide rate. In 2009, the number of suicides {{exceeded}} 30,000 for the twelfth straight year. Suicide {{is the leading cause}} <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>for</b> people under 30.|$|E
5|$|In {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by The Kennel Club, the primary cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>for</b> Fox Terriers was old age, causing 31.8% of reported deaths. The secondary cause was cancer of an unspecified type, which accounted for 22.7% of reports. The average lifespan of a Fox Terrier is around 15 years; however, the Kennel Club survey reported a median age at death of 13 years and 2 months.|$|E
5|$|One {{can also}} {{calculate}} auto fatalities per driver's license. From 1990 to 2009, this number {{has also been}} improving: from 1 death per 3,745 driver's licenses in 1990 to 1 per 6,200 driver's licenses in 2009. Crowded, traffic-choked Northeastern cities including Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Boston, Providence, Philadelphia, Newark, Hartford, New Haven, Springfield and Worcester, Massachusetts, {{were most likely to}} have car accidents. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration through its Fatality Analysis Reporting System stated that auto fatalities continue to be the leading cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>for</b> young adults.|$|E

30|$|For animal illness sensitivity, we again draw on households’ {{explanations}} for livestock mortality. As {{reported in the}} final column of Table  8, <b>of</b> all animal <b>deaths</b> reported, animal disease was cited as the cause <b>for</b> 31 % <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>for</b> the left out group, 40 % <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>for</b> the moving from group, 21 % <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>for</b> the staying with group, and 27 % <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>for</b> the combining group. The staying with group is less exposed to disease transmission relative to the more sedentary groups. We can also pair the relatively low drought loss for the moving from group reported in Table  4 with the relatively high animal disease exposure reported in Table  8 for this group to interpret their smaller herds and lower mobility exposing them differently to animal loss than {{may be the case}} for the other groups.|$|R

5|$|Since {{birds are}} highly visible and common animals, humans {{have had a}} {{relationship}} with them since the dawn of man. Sometimes, these relationships are mutualistic, like the cooperative honey-gathering among honeyguides and African peoples such as the Borana. Other times, they may be commensal, as when species such as the house sparrow have benefited from human activities. Several bird species have become commercially significant agricultural pests, and some pose an aviation hazard. Human activities can also be detrimental, and have threatened numerous bird species with extinction (hunting, avian lead poisoning, pesticides, roadkill, wind turbine kills and predation by pet cats and dogs are common sources <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>for</b> birds).|$|E
5|$|The 2014 {{maternal}} mortality rate per 100,000 births for Zimbabwe was 614 compared to 960 in 2010–11 and 232 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births was 75 in 2014 (94 in 2009).

Two of the victims, Anneli Alderton and Paula Clennell, were confirmed to have been killed by asphyxiation.

5|$|The {{bodies were}} brought to the local high school {{gymnasium}} to await autopsy and identification by an FBI fingerprinting team.

One of the victims was Vice Admiral Edward Orrick McDonnell, U.S. Navy (retired), a recipient of the Medal of Honor and a veteran of both World Wars. Other victims included {{a vice president of the}} Continental Bank of Cuba, a pharmacist, a student at the University of Miami, and an insurance adjuster. Three of the victims had been standby passengers and only made the flight due to others cancelling their reservations.|$|E
5|$|There {{was a bit}} of {{controversy}} surrounding the cover art used for this album. Sepultura had initially planned on using another Michael Whelan cover art, Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre. Monte Conner of Roadrunner sent the original artwork to Obituary, who used it on their album, Cause <b>of</b> <b>Death.</b> <b>For</b> years after the incident, Igor Cavalera was upset with Monte Conner for giving away their album cover. The artwork for Arise, however, was designed by Michael Whelan exclusively for the album.|$|E
5|$|According to the Board, Grissom {{suffered}} severe third degree {{burns on}} over one-third {{of his body}} and his spacesuit was mostly destroyed. White suffered third degree burns on almost half of his body and a quarter of his spacesuit had melted away. Chaffee suffered third degree burns over {{almost a quarter of}} his body and a small portion of his spacesuit was damaged. The autopsy report confirmed that the primary cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>for</b> all three astronauts was cardiac arrest caused by high concentrations of carbon monoxide. Burns suffered by the crew were not believed to be major factors, and it was concluded that most of them had occurred postmortem. Asphyxiation happened after the fire melted the astronauts' suits and oxygen tubes, exposing them to the lethal atmosphere of the cabin.|$|E

5|$|Almost 25% {{of women}} will {{experience}} {{mental health issues}} over their lifetime. Women are at higher risk than men from anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. Globally, depression is the leading disease burden. In the United States, women have depression twice as often as men. The economic costs of depression in American women {{are estimated to be}} $20 billion every year. The risks of depression in women have been linked to changing hormonal environment that women experience, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause. Women also metabolise drugs used to treat depression differently to men. Suicide rates are less in women than men (<1% vs. 2.4%), but are a leading cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>for</b> women under the age of 60.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{disease is}} listed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services {{as the number}} one cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>for</b> all women. Factors that add to {{risk of heart disease}} include obesity and smoking, both of which are more {{prevalent}} in lesbians. Studies show that lesbians have a higher body mass and are generally less concerned about weight issues than heterosexual women, and lesbians consider women with higher body masses to be more attractive than heterosexual women do. Lesbians are more likely to exercise regularly than heterosexual women, and lesbians do not generally exercise for aesthetic reasons, although heterosexual women do. Research is needed to determine specific causes of obesity in lesbians.|$|E
5|$|In {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by the Kennel Club (UK), the American Cocker Spaniels had a median age of death of ten years and four months, while the English Cocker Spaniel had a median age of eleven years and two months. According to the survey, the most common cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>for</b> both breeds was cancer, while old age was the second most common cause. The two modern breeds are susceptible to several health problems. Issues common to the two breeds include ear infections, and a variety of eye problems. A large number of breeds are susceptible to hip dysplasia. In {{a survey conducted}} by Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, the American Cocker Spaniel was ranked 115th out of 157 different breeds, with 1 being the highest percentage dysplastic and 157 being the lowest percentage dysplastic. The English Cocker was ranked 129th.|$|E

5|$|While in Lexington for a {{deposition}} on May 26, 2002, Wilkinson began to experience chest pains and {{was admitted to}} St. Joseph's Hospital. Doctors diagnosed him with arterial blockages and scheduled him for arterial bypass surgery. Before the surgery could be performed, however, doctors discovered another lymphatic mass. Wilkinson began taking chemotherapy, and doctors removed the mass on June 4, 2002. Wilkinson was placed on life support on June 26, 2002. He suffered a stroke on July 4, 2002. Wilkinson had previously instructed his family not to continue life support after all hope of recovery was gone; accordingly, they decided to withdraw life support, and Wilkinson died on July 5, 2002. He was originally buried at Blue Grass Memorial Gardens in Nicholasville, Kentucky. In August 2002, his coffin was moved to a locked mausoleum at Sarasota Memorial Park in Sarasota, Florida; the family chose July 4, 2002 as the date <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>for</b> his marker.
