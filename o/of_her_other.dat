5|$|As {{a popular}} and {{acceptable}} activity, botany {{had been taken}} up by many middle class ladies, and Darwin included these botany enthusiasts in his correspondence. On the recommendation of John Lindley, Darwin wrote to Lady Dorothy Nevill, who responded generously by sending numerous exotic orchids, and requested a signed photograph of him to hang in her sitting room next to portraits <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>other</b> notable friends, including Hooker.|$|E
5|$|Ralphie V {{took the}} field with the {{football}} team {{for the first time}} at the spring game on April 19, 2008. In her pre-game run Ralphie ran perfectly, but slipped out of her harness at the very start of the halftime run, bumping, but not trampling, one handler and shedding all but one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>other</b> handlers. Zeb Kopasz was the only handler to hold on to her. They were able to get her under control on the far 25-yard line and return her to her trailer.|$|E
5|$|Tashkent was {{assigned}} to the Far East Shipping Company (FESCO), but sailed with the Pacific Fleet of the Soviet Navy throughout the war. Tashkent was photographed at San Francisco {{at some point during the}} war, but most <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>other</b> movements are not known. However, in August 1945, Tashkent delivered troops and cargo in support of the Soviet invasions of Japanese-held Manchuria, Korea, Sakhalin, and the Kurile Islands. After the war's end, Tashkent returned to merchant operation with FESCO through 1966, when she was transferred to North Korea for use as a fish processing facility. The former Tashkent was scrapped in 1969.|$|E

5|$|Halperin {{cautioned that}} Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, {{and some of}} the {{statements}} about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>other</b> suitors ever quite measured up to him. The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical, as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen never saw him again. In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.|$|E
5|$|Mahesh {{played the}} role of Shankar, an {{encounter}} specialist similar to the one he played in Dookudu. This was the third time Mahesh {{played the role}} of a police officer in his career. Tamannaah was signed as the female lead and she {{played the role of}} a local sweet shop owner. She sported a traditional attire for her look in the film. Rajendra Prasad was chosen to play Mahesh's father in the film. Prakash Raj was selected to play a negative role in the film. He was later replaced with Sonu Sood due to his creative differences with Vaitla. Brahmaji played the role of an honest police constable. Shruti Haasan performed an item number in the film which was the first <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>other</b> similar special appearances. Brahmanandam was signed to play a supporting role. He performed a spoof of Racha (2011), Legend (2014) and Race Gurram (2014). Mahesh performed a spoof on the game show Meelo Evaru Koteeswarudu.|$|E
5|$|Mary's {{request to}} be buried in France was refused by Elizabeth. Her body was embalmed and left unburied in a secure lead coffin until her burial, in a Protestant service, at Peterborough Cathedral in late July 1587. Her entrails, removed as part of the {{embalming}} process, were buried secretly within Fotheringhay Castle. Her body was exhumed in 1612 when her son, King James VI and I, ordered that she be reinterred in Westminster Abbey, in a chapel opposite the tomb of Elizabeth I. In 1867, her tomb was opened in an attempt to ascertain the resting place of James I; he was ultimately found with Henry VII, but many <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>other</b> descendants, including Elizabeth of Bohemia, Prince Rupert of the Rhine and the children of Anne, Queen of Great Britain, were interred in her vault.|$|E

25|$|Then, {{there is}} the {{question}} of the last three poems that were found among her papers. They seem to be in her handwriting, which is why Killigrew’s father added them to her book. The poems are about the despair the author has for another woman, and could possibly be autobiographical if they are in fact by Killigrew. Some <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>other</b> poems are about failed friendships, possibly with Anne Finch, so this assumption may have some validity.|$|E

Suyuan survived, but was haunted by guilt {{in the loss of}} her daughters and never knew what happened to them.|$|E
25|$|The {{exact nature}} of her {{relationship}} with her royal sister-in-law is not clear either, and there is no evidence as to what she thought <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>other</b> sister-in-law, Mary Boleyn, who had been at court with Jane since they were both teenagers. It is generally assumed that Jane was not overly fond of Anne, allegedly because of Jane's jealousy of her. Regardless, Jane plotted with Anne to banish one of the King's young unnamed mistresses from court in 1534. When the King discovered her involvement, Lady Rochford was herself exiled for a few months.|$|E
