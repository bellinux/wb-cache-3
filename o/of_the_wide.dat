5|$|Cabbage was {{probably}} domesticated later in history than Near Eastern {{crops such as}} lentils and summer wheat. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> range of crops developed from the wild B.oleracea, multiple broadly contemporaneous domestications of cabbage may have occurred throughout Europe. Nonheading cabbages and kale were probably {{the first to be}} domesticated, before 1000 BC, by the Celts of central and western Europe.|$|E
5|$|Pet {{birds are}} kept in their millions, as are {{domestic}} fowls, bantams, and pigeons.

5|$|The {{principal}} receivers are {{the wide}} receivers (WR) and the tight ends (TE). Wide receivers line up {{on or near}} the line of scrimmage, split outside the line. The main goal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> receiver is to catch passes thrown by the quarterback, but they may also function as decoys or as blockers during running plays. Tight ends line up outside the tackles and function both as receivers and as blockers.|$|E
5|$|The reformers' {{propaganda}} {{claimed that}} England had been unified {{as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> acceptance of Benedictinism, and that the movement's greatest benefactor, King Edgar, had {{played a major role}} in the unification by his demands for adherence to the Benedictine Rule. Æthelwold probably tutored Edgar as a boy, and was very close to him; it is likely that Æthelwold was influential in persuading the king to carry through his reforms and support Benedictine monasticism. Monks became dominant on the bishops' bench during his reign.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{specific}} medical or screening tests {{that can be}} used in diagnosing Tourette's; it is frequently misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed, partly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> expression of severity, ranging from mild (the majority of cases) or moderate, to severe (the rare, but more widely recognized and publicized cases). Coughing, eye blinking, and tics that mimic unrelated conditions such as asthma are commonly misdiagnosed.|$|E

5|$|Various {{authors have}} {{proposed}} slightly different {{analyses of the}} Khmer vowel system. This may be in part because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> degree of variation in pronunciation between individual speakers, even within a dialectal region. The description below follows Huffman (1970). The number of vowel nuclei and their values vary between dialects; differences exist even between the Standard Khmer system {{and that of the}} Battambang dialect on which the standard is based.|$|E
5|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this method}} {{is that it can}} be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy. Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies {{are more likely to be}} considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like analogy and homology and if they can demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy. Both quantitative analyses and interpretations based on ethnographic analogies and other contextual evidence have recently been applied in systematic studies of architectural orientations in the Maya area and in other parts of Mesoamerica.|$|E

His role in the latter earned him an agent and his first professional jobs, Fresh Kills and On the Shore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wide</b> World. His new professional roles led him to seek an agreement with his university so that he could graduate without attending lectures in his final year.|$|E

5|$|Calcium ions may be {{complexed}} by proteins through binding the {{carboxyl groups}} of glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues; through interacting with phosphorylated serine, tyrosine, or threonine residues; or by being chelated by γ-carboxylated amino acid residues. Trypsin, a digestive enzyme, uses the first method; osteocalcin, a bone matrix protein, uses the third. Some other bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein use both {{the first and}} the second. Direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common; some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes. Calcium also binds to the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane, anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface. As an example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> range of solubility of calcium compounds, monocalcium phosphate is very soluble in water, 85% of extracellular calcium is as dicalcium phosphate with a solubility of 2.0mM and the hydroxyapatite of bones in an organic matrix is tricalcium phosphate at 100µM.|$|E
5|$|During the {{operations}} {{along the south}} coast of New Britain the AIB officers sought to discourage the Japanese from moving west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wide</b> Bay area by circulating rumours among the local population that a large Australian base had been established at Jacquinot Bay. In reality no such base existed at this time. The AIB force continued to make guerilla attacks on Japanese positions until early October, when it was ordered to cease offensive operations and concentrate on intelligence gathering ahead of the landing of Australian infantry and support units at Jacquinot Bay. The AIB's operations from June to October were assisted by occasional air attacks and naval bombardments conducted by elements of the Allied air forces and navies.|$|E
5|$|One-thousand years ago, the nomadic Timbisha (formerly called Shoshone {{and also}} known as Panamint or Koso) moved into the area and hunted game and {{gathered}} mesquite beans along with pinyon pine nuts. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> altitude differential between the valley bottom and the mountain ridges, especially on the west, the Timbisha practiced a vertical migration pattern. Their winter camps were located near water sources in the valley bottoms. As {{the spring and summer}} progressed and the weather warmed, grasses and other plant food sources ripened at progressively higher altitudes. November found them {{at the very top of}} the mountain ridges where they harvested pine nuts before moving back to the valley bottom for winter.|$|E

On the {{fifth of the}} month a patrol of American troops attacked the position at Awul, causing its garrison to retreat into {{the centre of the}} island. Other attacks by the AIB force followed, and by early September all of the Japanese observation posts west of Wide Bay had been destroyed. Japanese troops conducted small scale reprisals against the native population <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wide</b> Bay hinterland, and the AIB officers attempted to persuade the population of this area to move inland before more severe reprisals were conducted.|$|E
