5|$|Henry {{was born}} in late 1068, died 1 December 1135. King of England, married Edith of Scotland, {{daughter}} <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm</b> III of Scotland. His second wife was Adeliza of Louvain.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that a third daughter <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm</b> married Findláech mac Ruaidrí and that Mac Bethad was thus his grandson, but this rests on relatively weak evidence.|$|E
5|$|Malcolm II {{was born}} to Kenneth II of Scotland. He was {{grandson}} <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm</b> I of Scotland. In 997, the killer of Constantine is credited as being Kenneth, son <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm.</b> Since there is no known and relevant Kenneth alive at that time (King Kenneth having died in 995), it is considered an error for either Kenneth III, who succeeded Constantine, or, possibly, Malcolm himself, the son of Kenneth II. Whether Malcolm killed Constantine or not, {{there is no doubt}} that in 1005 he killed Constantine's successor Kenneth III in battle at Monzievaird in Strathearn.|$|E
50|$|Half <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm's</b> Additional Continental Regiment {{was drawn}} from New York and half from Pennsylvania.|$|R

5|$|In Macbett, Eugène Ionesco's 1972 stage adaptation, Fleance is {{merged with}} the Malcolm character. Macol (Malcolm), who {{is thought to be}} King Duncan's son, is {{revealed}} to be Banco's (Banquo's). Duncan, wanting a male heir, adopted Macol. Macol fills the role <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm</b> in taking the kingdom from Macbett (Macbeth) {{at the end of the}} play.|$|E
5|$|In Orson Welles's {{film version}} of Macbeth (1948), Fleance is briefly seen again {{at the very end}} of the movie. He does not speak in this scene, but he has {{returned}} to Scotland with the army <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm</b> and Macduff, and is shown along with those hailing Malcolm as the new king after the killing of Macbeth.|$|E
5|$|Later, in 1095, an English noble, Robert de Mowbray, who was Earl of Northumbria, {{challenged}} the bishop's {{authority in the}} north. When Mowbray rebelled again in 1095, St-Calais helped the king put down the rebellion, and Mowbray was captured. The death <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm</b> and the capture of Mowbray did much to make the north more secure.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about Macbeth's early life, {{although}} {{he was the son}} of Findláech of Moray and may have been a grandson <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm</b> II. He became Mormaer of Moray – a semi-autonomous lordship – in 1032, and was probably responsible for the death of the previous mormaer, Gille Coemgáin. He subsequently married Gille Coemgáin's widow, Gruoch, although they had no children together.|$|E
5|$|No {{consensus}} {{has been}} reached on {{who was responsible for}} the assassination. In August 2014, an online petition was started using the White House online petition mechanism to call on the government to release without alteration any files they still held relating to the murder <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm</b> X. The petition failed to attract enough signatures to mandate a White House response.|$|E
5|$|Sigurd left four sons: Brusi, Sumarlidi, Einar and Thorfinn, each of {{whom would}} also bear the title Earl of Orkney; the lands were {{initially}} divided amongst the three older brothers, Thorfinn being only five {{years old at the}} time. Thorfinn's mother is specifically stated to be a daughter <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm</b> II, the Norsemen's foe at Mortlach.|$|E
60|$|James started {{somewhat}} as {{he remembered}} overruling this objection <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm's</b> own making. 'She cannot have the insolence,' he said.|$|R
50|$|Founded by Rowena Moore, the {{organization}} {{is located on the}} site <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm's</b> first home in Omaha at 3448 Pinkney Street.|$|R
5000|$|Eraserhead, {{played by}} Will Jennings (12 episodes), is one <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm's</b> [...] "Krelboyne" [...] classmates who recurs {{throughout}} early episodes of the series.|$|R
5|$|William Rufus, King of England, opposed Donald's {{accession}} to the northerly kingdom. He sent {{the eldest son}} <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm,</b> David's half-brother Duncan, into Scotland with an army. Duncan was killed within the year, and so in 1097 William sent Donnchad's half-brother Edgar into Scotland. The latter was more successful, and was crowned King {{by the end of}} 1097.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Pinker wrote a mixed review <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm</b> Gladwell's {{essays in}} The New York Times criticizing his {{analytical}} methods. Gladwell replied, disputing Pinker's {{comments about the}} importance of IQ on teaching performance and by analogy, the effect, if any, of draft order on quarterback performance in the National Football League. Advanced NFL Stats addressed the issue statistically, siding with Pinker and showing that differences in methodology could explain the two men's differing opinions.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Avram Glazer – the son <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm</b> Glazer – {{was looking}} into {{investment}} in European football. The Glazer family already owned several {{businesses in the}} United States and had purchased the Tampa Bay Buccaneers National Football League franchise in 1995. They convinced the local government to fund a new stadium for the Buccaneers in 1998 and the franchise won its first Super Bowl in January 2003.|$|E

60|$|The consul {{was obliged}} again to protest that in so short an {{interview}} {{he had been}} unable to conceive <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm's</b> good fortune.|$|R
50|$|Early in 1777, Washington offered {{command of}} one of these {{additional}} regiments to William <b>Malcolm</b> <b>of</b> New York, who accepted. Malcolm had formerly commanded a New York militia unit. Half <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm’s</b> Regiment was drawn from New York and half from Pennsylvania.|$|R
5|$|The Autobiography <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm</b> X was {{published}} in 1965, {{the result of a}} collaboration between human rights activist MalcolmX and journalist Alex Haley. Haley coauthored the autobiography based on a series of in-depth interviews he conducted between 1963 and MalcolmX's 1965 assassination. The Autobiography is a spiritual conversion narrative that outlines MalcolmX's philosophy of black pride, black nationalism, and pan-Africanism. After the leader was killed, Haley wrote the book's epilogue. He described their collaborative process and the events at the end of MalcolmX's life.|$|E
5|$|The first {{reliable}} report <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm</b> II's reign is of {{an invasion}} of Bernicia in 1006, perhaps the customary crech ríg (literally royal prey, a raid by a new king made to demonstrate prowess in war), which involved a siege of Durham. This appears to {{have resulted in a}} heavy defeat by the Northumbrians, led by Uhtred of Bamburgh, later Earl of Bernicia, which is reported by the Annals of Ulster.|$|E
5|$|The {{house that}} once stood at 3448 Pinkney Street in North Omaha, Nebraska, {{was the first}} home <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm</b> Little with his birth family. The house was torn down in 1965 by new owners {{who did not know}} of its {{connection}} with MalcolmX. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 and is now identified by a historic marker. In 1987 the site was added to the Nebraska register of historic sites and marked with a state plaque.|$|E
50|$|They {{boys are}} brought {{together}} at the funeral <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm's</b> mother, where he is joined by Ethan in subtly announcing their relationship—"You Walk with Me".|$|R
50|$|Cynthia Sanders, {{played by}} Tania Raymonde (4 episodes), is one <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm's</b> classmates. She {{has a very}} {{extensive}} vocabulary, but has a difficult time making friends. Depicted as relatively cheerful, Cynthia becomes one <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm's</b> earliest crushes on the show, although a relationship never develops. Cynthia is last seen claiming to never have sex with Malcolm again (which never happened in the first place) to snap {{him out of a}} recent funk and keep him from pulling a prank meant to get him sent away like Francis.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What means this, {{my young}} lord?' said Dr. Bennet, pausing, while his brethren passed on. 'Are you sick?' he added, kindly, seeing the {{whiteness}} <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm's</b> face, and his startled eye.|$|R
5|$|By the 1030s Malcolm's sons, {{if he had}} any, were dead. The only {{evidence}} that {{he did have a}} son or sons is in Rodulfus Glaber's chronicle where Cnut is said to have stood as godfather to a son <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm.</b> His grandson Thorfinn would have been unlikely to be accepted as king by the Scots, and he chose the sons of his other daughter, Bethóc, who was married to Crínán, lay abbot of Dunkeld, and perhaps Mormaer of Atholl. It may be no more than coincidence, but in 1027 the Irish annals had reported the burning of Dunkeld, although no mention is made of the circumstances. Malcolm's chosen heir, and the first tánaise ríg certainly known in Scotland, was Duncan.|$|E
5|$|On 11 November 1100 Henry married Matilda, the {{daughter}} <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm</b> III of Scotland. Henry was now around 31 years old, but late marriages for noblemen were not {{unusual in the}} 11th century. The pair had probably first met earlier the previous decade, possibly being introduced through Bishop Osmund of Salisbury. Historian Warren Hollister argues that Henry and Matilda were emotionally close, but their union was also certainly politically motivated. Matilda had originally been named Edith, an Anglo-Saxon name, {{and was a member}} of the West Saxon royal family, being the niece of Edgar the Ætheling, the great-granddaughter of Edmund Ironside and a descendant of Alfred the Great. For Henry, marrying Matilda gave his reign increased legitimacy, and for Matilda, an ambitious woman, it was an opportunity for high status and power in England.|$|E
5|$|Some sources {{state that}} William the Lion had a royal castle at Urquhart in the 12th century, though Professor Alcock finds no {{evidence}} for this. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Meic Uilleim (MacWilliams), descendents <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm</b> III, staged a series of rebellions against David I and his successors. The last of these rebellions was put down in 1229, and to maintain order Alexander II granted Urquhart to his Hostarius (usher or door-ward), Thomas de Lundin. On de Lundin's death {{a few years later}} it passed to his son Alan Durward. It is considered likely that the original castle was built soon after this time, centred on the motte at the south-west of the site. In 1275, after Alan's death, the king granted Urquhart to John II Comyn, Lord of Badenoch.|$|E
50|$|A {{collection}} <b>of</b> <b>Malcolm's</b> papers, including series {{relating to}} his {{service in the}} Philippines and in Puerto Rico, is housed at the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan and open for research.|$|R
