5|$|Mount Osmond {{contains}} {{a number of}} historical attractions; notably in the former mines and mining infrastructure that remains <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hillside</b> {{as a reminder of}} its past. The mines continue up throughout the hills from Glen Osmond. While Wheal Gawler and Wheal Watkins are former open-cut mines (located in Glen Osmond), Mount Osmond contains more mineshafts which are up to sixty metres deep.|$|E
5|$|The {{phylloxera}} {{epidemic in}} the 19th century severely affected the Languedoc wine industry, killing off {{many of the}} higher quality Vitis vinifera that were susceptible to the louse. American rootstock that was naturally resistant to phylloxera did not take well to the limestone soil <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hillside.</b> In place of these vines, acres of the lower quality Aramon, Alicante Bouschet and Carignan were planted.|$|E
5|$|The {{stadium is}} divided into five all-seater stands, the JCT600 Stand, the Kop, the Midland Road Stand, the North West Corner and the TL Dallas Stand. All five stands are covered except for {{a small part of}} the main stand, and all but the Midland Road Stand being two-tiered. Most of the stands are {{cantilever}} structures, and because of the ground's location <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hillside,</b> the Midland Road Stand overhangs the road.|$|E

5|$|Whatever its origin, {{the giant}} {{has become an}} {{important}} part of the culture and folklore of Dorset. Some folk stories indicate that the image is an outline of the corpse of a real giant. One story says the giant came from Denmark leading an invasion of the coast, and was beheaded by the people of Cerne Abbas while he slept <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hillside.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>hillside</b> of the Colhugh Valley {{there are}} a row of houses {{situated}} at Hillhead in Llantwit Major. The houses {{were built in the}} early years of the 19th century for the poor of the parish. With the introduction of the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, a workhouse was opened in Bridgend. The houses became surplus to requirements and were then sold as private residences. Llantwit Major came under the Bridgend and Cowbridge Poor Law Union. Each unit was originally divided into two separate upper and lower accommodation, the upstairs entrance was from the west and the entrance to the lower accommodation came from the east.|$|E
5|$|On the surface, Ambrose thanks the Doctor for {{not letting}} the Silurians execute her for killing Alaya, and the Doctor asks {{her to help}} prepare {{humanity}} for their next encounter with the Silurians. The Doctor and Amy return to the TARDIS, where Amy sights her future self <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hillside</b> without Rory. The Doctor takes out the object he pulled from the crack: a burnt piece of the TARDIS's sign. He worriedly compares it to the real thing. Aside from the damage, they appear identical.|$|E

5|$|Worlebury Camp (also {{known as}} Worlebury Hillfort) {{is the site}} of an Iron Age hillfort on Worlebury Hill, north of Weston-super-Mare in Somerset, England. The fort was {{designed}} for defence, as is evidenced by the number of walls and ditches around the site. Several large triangular platforms have been uncovered around the sides of the fort, lower down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hillside.</b> Nearly one hundred storage pits of various sizes were cut into the bedrock, and many of these had human remains, coins, and other artefacts in them. During the 19th and 20th centuries the fort has suffered damage and been threatened with complete destruction on multiple occasions. The site has been designated a Scheduled monument; it falls within the Weston Woods Local Nature Reserve which was declared to Natural England by North Somerset Council in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Amidst {{the flames}} and rubble, Arenberg's and Ferdinand's troops tried to storm the castle, but {{found their way}} blocked by masses of debris created by their own explosives. Furthermore, {{although}} close to half of the garrison had perished in the explosion and subsequent collapse of the fortifications, those who remained offered staunch resistance by throwing rocks on the approaching attackers, causing {{a large number of}} casualties. In frustration, 40 or 50 of the attackers tied together two ladders and crawled through the sluice-ways of the garderobe (latrines) that emptied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hillside,</b> thus gaining access to the interior of the castle. There they killed around 20 of the defenders in fierce fighting; the remaining defenders, approximately 70 men, among them Buchner and Sudermann, the garrison commander and his lieutenant, sought refuge in the castle's keep. In this way, Ferdinand's infantry at last gained unopposed access to the fortress. Storming the castle had taken about two hours.|$|E
5|$|From {{around the}} 1860s to just before World War II {{passengers}} could ride to Kittanning Point station near the Curve. Two branch railroads {{connected to the}} main line at Horseshoe Curve in the early 20th century; the Kittanning Run Railroad and the railroad owned by the Glen White Coal and Lumber Company followed their respective creeks to nearby coal mines. The Pennsylvania Railroad delivered empty hopper cars to the Kittanning Point station which the two railroads returned loaded with coal. Across from the station, a spur track <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hillside</b> supplied a coal trestle, where trains could take on fuel and water during the early 1900s. A reservoir was built {{at the apex of}} the Horseshoe Curve in 1887 for the city of Altoona; a second reservoir, below the first, was finished in 1896. The third reservoir, Lake Altoona, was completed by 1913. A macadam road to the curve was opened in 1932 allowing access for visitors, and a gift shop was built in 1940.|$|E
40|$|Laurel {{forests are}} found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill between the Hoshoji-Temple and the Guzein-Temple. They were {{classified}} into Ardisio-Castanopsietum sieboldii and Polysticho-Machiletum thunbergii by Miyawaki et al. phytosociologically (1979). Based upon Br. -Bl. (1964) and Belt-transect methods (Tatewaki, 1952), the authors investigated the most typical community thereof. We also conducted tree census and flora census. In consequence, {{it turned out}} that <b>the</b> forests <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hillsides</b> facing <b>the</b> Hoshoji-Temple were mainly dominated by Castanopsis cuspidata var. sieboldii, while <b>the</b> forests <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hillsides</b> facing <b>the</b> Guzein-Temple consisted of many different kinds of deciduous broad-leaved trees...|$|R
50|$|İkizdere is an {{agricultural}} district, growing tea <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hillsides</b> and potatoes in the valley, {{and now some}} kiwi fruit are being planted also. Cattle and sheep are grazed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hillsides,</b> {{going up to the}} high pastures (yayla) in summer. Beekeeping is another important source of income, particularly in the village of Anzer. And this very attractive countryside is now attracting tourists, on trekking holidays. However, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> whole İkizdere is not a wealthy region and the younger generations migrate to Turkey's larger cities in search of jobs.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, archaeologists {{discovered}} {{the first evidence}} of possible Roman terracing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hillsides</b> of <b>the</b> Moselle valley: Land consolidation and the laying out of new farm tracks in vineyards <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Middle Moselle and the upper Lower Moselle exposed the foundations of ancient Celtic houses {{at the foot of}} <b>the</b> <b>hillsides.</b> <b>The</b> archaeological sites <b>on</b> <b>the</b> steep <b>hillsides</b> still being managed today could therefore be viewed as evidence of Roman terracing on these slopes in the 3rd century AD.|$|R
5|$|East of Eckhart Mines, Alt US40 {{passes through}} Clarysville, where it intersects MD55. It is near Clarysville that the terrain {{followed}} by Alt US40 changes: from Clarysville westward {{to the summit}} of Savage Mountain, the road runs uphill, while east of Clarysville, the road follows valleys, first following the valley around Braddock Run to Cumberland, and then following the valley around Wills Creek into Cumberland. Near the MD55 intersection is a stone arch bridge which was initially built in 1812 and rebuilt in the 1830s, and carried the National Road over Braddock Run, a tributary to Wills Creek. East of Clarysville, the highway passes through a gap carved by Braddock Run between Piney Mountain and Dan's Mountain. I-68, having been built later, is located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hillside</b> above Alt US40, on the Dan's Mountain side of the gap. Alt US40 then descends Red Hill into LaVale. At the bottom of Red Hill is the La Vale toll gate house. Built in 1836, tolls were collected there until the early 1900s, {{and it is the}} last original National Road toll gate house standing in Maryland. In LaVale, the route intersects MD53, which serves as a truck bypass for US 220 to Cresaptown. Alt US40 interchanges with westbound I-68 at exit 39, but eastbound access is only available via MD53 and MD658, which intersects Alt US40 east of the exit 39 interchange. The highway expands to a four-lane road near its intersection with MD53, then narrows to a two-lane road near its intersection with MD658. East of the intersection with MD658, Alt US40 turns northward, passing through LaVale toward the Narrows, bypassing Haystack Mountain to the north, as opposed to I-68, which passes directly over Haystack Mountain, paralleling Braddock Road (MD49).|$|E
5|$|US219 passes {{along the}} eastern edge of Mount Nebo Wildlife Management Area and crosses Hoop Pole Hill. North of Sand Flat Road, the highway passes Mayhew Inn Road, which leads west to Swallow Falls State Park. US 219 descends from Hoop Pole Ridge and reaches the southwestern shore of Deep Creek Lake in the hamlet of Thayerville. After passing Glendale Road, which heads east toward Deep Creek Lake State Park and other {{destinations}} {{on the east side of}} the lake, the highway turns northwest and parallels the west shore of the lake east of Roman Nose Hill. After passing Lakeshore Drive, US219 crosses the lake on the Deep Creek Bridge. The highway becomes a partially controlled access highway <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hillside</b> above the lake, while Deep Creek Drive follows the shore. US219 continues north through the unincorporated village of McHenry. In McHenry, the highway intersects Mosser Road, which provides access to Garrett College and Garrett County Airport, and Sang Run Road, which leads to Wisp Ski Resort. After meeting the northern end of Deep Creek Drive, the highway leaves Deep Creek Lake and curves northeast at its junction with MD42 (Friendsville Road). US219 continues northeast along Rocklick Creek and the South Branch of Bear Creek. After leaving the South Branch, the highway follows Main Street through the town of Accident. Within the town, the highway intersects Accident Friendsville Road and Accident Bittinger Road, which heads east toward the James Drane House.|$|E

25|$|Group Q4-1 {{has been}} {{investigated}} by archaeologists, they recovered ceramic remains dating to the Terminal Classic. Unusually for such a late date, Group Q4-1 is located low down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hillside</b> near agricultural terracing {{and one of the}} water sources.|$|E
50|$|The {{magnificent}} scenery, the balmy summer climate and, especially, {{the proximity}} to Madrid and Segovia {{have resulted in}} the erection of many striking buildings and monuments <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hillsides</b> of <b>the</b> Sierra de Guadarrama.|$|R
50|$|European ivy (Hedera helix) {{is found}} in the nature as creeper plant. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>hillsides,</b> {{flowering}} plants such as stonecrops (Sedum hispanicum) and (Sedum spurium), oleander (Nerium oleander), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) and nandina (Nandina domestica)).|$|R
