40|$|Liquidâ€“liquid coaxial swirl atomizers {{are used}} in liquid rocket engines to achieve an {{efficient}} mixing between the fuel and oxidizer sprays. The characteristics of the mixed spray are mainly controlled by the flow behavior of merged liquid sheet originating at the contact point of inner and <b>outer</b> swirling liquid <b>sheets.</b> With an intention of identifying various flow regimes of merged liquid sheet at different conditions of inner and <b>outer</b> liquid <b>sheets,</b> we report here a fundamental experimental investigation {{on the characteristics of}} merged liquid sheets using water as the experimental liquid. The physical processes involved in the formation and separation of a merged liquid sheet are described from the experimental measurements. For a given <b>outer</b> liquid <b>sheet</b> condition, the merged liquid sheet forms and separates at specific inner liquid sheet flow conditions. At low <b>outer</b> liquid <b>sheet</b> flow conditions with Weber number less than 50, the merged liquid sheet exhibits a self-sustaining periodic separation process, whose frequency increases with increasing inner liquid sheet Weber number for a given <b>outer</b> liquid <b>sheet</b> Weber number.

40|$|The thermal {{protection}} {{system of the}} windward surface of the X- 33 vehicle consists of metallic honeycomb sandwich panels. Thermal gradients experienced during the descent phase of the trajectory result in a different rate of thermal expansion between the inner and <b>outer</b> face <b>sheets</b> of the metallic panels.

5000|$|Nag Hammadi {{bindings}} {{were constructed}} with a textblock of papyrus sheets, assembled {{into a single}} section and trimmed along the fore edge after folding to prevent the inner sheets from extending outward beyond the <b>outer</b> <b>sheets.</b> Because the inner sheets were narrower than the <b>outer</b> <b>sheets</b> after trimming, the width of text varied through the textblock, {{and it is likely}} that the papyrus was not written on until after it was bound; this, in turn, would have made it a necessity to calculate the number of sheets needed for a manuscript before it was written and bound. [...] Covers of Nag Hammadi bindings were limp leather, stiffened with waste sheets of papyrus. The textblocks were sewn with tackets, with leather stays along the inside fold as reinforcement. These tackets also secured the textblock to the covers; on some of the Nag Hammadi bindings, the tackets extended to the outside of the covering leather, while on others the tackets were attached to a strip of leather which served as a spine liner, and which was in turn pasted to the covers. [...] A flap, either triangular or rectangular, extended from the front cover of the book, and was wrapped around the fore edge of the book when closed. Attached to the flap was a long leather thong which was wrapped around the book two or three times, and which served as a clasp to keep the book securely shut.|$|R

CNT sheets were observed to delaminate during uniaxial testing using an adbesive gripping method, {{resulting from a}} higher proportion of load bearing in the <b>outer</b> <b>sheets</b> versus internal sheets and an apparently low interlaminar shear strength. In response to this, a new spool-grip method was used to alleviate non-uniform through-thickness stresses, circumvent premature delamination, and allow the sheet material to sustain a 72 % increase in measured tensile strength. Furthermore, tension tests of CNT yarns showed that the yarn-structure was approximaiely 7 times stronger than the sheet structure, owing to a higher degree of CNT alignment in the test direction...|$|R

5000|$|The metal {{walls of}} the firebox are {{normally}} called sheets, which are separated and supported by stays. The stays support and brace the [...] "sheets" [...] (plates) against pressure. Ideally, they should be located {{at right angles to}} the sheets, but since the <b>outer</b> <b>sheet</b> (wrapper sheet) is radial and the top of the firebox (crown sheet) is relatively flat by comparison, such a relationship to both sheets is impossible. The actual location of the stays is a compromise. Since stay breakage is hidden, the stays have longitudinal holes, called tell-tales, drilled in them which will blow water and steam, revealing if they are broken. A boiler with more than 5 broken stays, or two next to each, other must be taken out of service and the stays replaced. The fusible plugs, usually located in the highest part of the crown sheet, have a soft metal alloy core which melts out if the water level in the boiler gets too low. Steam and water blowing into the firebox both alerts the locomotive crew to the low water condition and helps put out the fire. Not all locomotives are equipped with fusible plugs. Also, fusible plugs should be replaced at regular intervals, about every three months for a locomotive in regular service, because the soft metal alloy core will slowly melt out over time even if the boiler water is carried at proper levels. The [...] "mudholes," [...] or washout plugs, allow access to the interior of the boiler for washing and scraping away boiler mud and scale.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: E colicin {{proteins}} {{have three}} functional domains, {{each of which}} is implicated in one of the stages of killing Escherichia coli cells: receptor binding, translocation and cytotoxicity. The central (R) domain is responsible for receptor-binding activity whereas the N-terminal (T) domain mediates translocation, the process by which the C-terminal cytotoxic domain is transported from the receptor to the site of its cytotoxicity. The translocation of enzymatic E colicins like colicin E 9 is dependent upon TolB but the details of the process are not known. Results: We have demonstrated a proteinâ€“protein interaction between the T domain of colicin E 9 and TolB, an essential component of the tol-dependent translocation system in E. coli, using the yeast two-hybrid system. The crystal structure of TolB, a procaryotic tryptophanâ€“aspartate (WD) repeat protein, reveals an N-terminal Î±+Î² domain based on a five-stranded mixed Î² sheet and a C-terminal six-bladed Î²-propeller domain. Conclusions: The results suggest that the TolB-box residues of the T domain of colicin E 9 interact with the Î²-propeller domain of TolB. The proteinâ€“protein interactions of other Î²-propeller-containing proteins, the yeast yPrp 4 protein and G proteins, are mediated by the loops or <b>outer</b> <b>sheets</b> of the propeller blades. The determination of the three-dimensional structure of the T domainâ€“TolB complex and the isolation of mutations in TolB that abolish the interaction with the T domain will reveal fine details of the proteinâ€“protein interaction of TolB and the T domain of E colicins...|$|R
