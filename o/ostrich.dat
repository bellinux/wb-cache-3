5|$|Joust 2 is a 2D combat game {{taking place}} in the air and on landing platforms, like its predecessor. The player {{controls}} a yellow knight riding a flying <b>ostrich</b> and navigates the game world with a two-way joystick and a button. The joystick controls the horizontal direction that the knight travels, while pressing the button makes the <b>ostrich</b> flap its wings. The rate at which the player repeatedly presses the button causes the <b>ostrich</b> to fly upward, hover, or slowly descend. The objective is to defeat groups of enemy knights riding buzzards that populate each level, referred to as a wave. Upon completing a wave, a more challenging one will begin.|$|E

5|$|The player {{controls}} {{a yellow}} knight riding a flying <b>ostrich</b> or stork, from a third-person perspective. Using the two-way directional joystick and the button for flapping the ostrich's wings, the player flies the knight amidst the floating rock platforms and above pools of lava; when maneuvering {{off the screen}} to either side, the player will continue its path reappearing from the opposite side. The {{rate at which the}} player repeatedly presses the button causes the <b>ostrich</b> to fly upward, hover, or slowly descend.|$|E

50|$|Another {{link with}} Whitford was <b>ostriches.</b> These {{were brought to}} Whitford by the L.D. Nathan family, who had a large farm {{originally}} called Whit Forde and bred <b>ostriches</b> for feathers, which were a high-fashion article on hats in the 1890s. Some of the <b>ostriches</b> were bought by Alfred Buckland's family to Bucklands Beach, where they were grazed.|$|R
5|$|Joust 2: Survival of the Fittest is an arcade game {{developed}} by Williams Electronics and released in 1986. It is {{a sequel to}} Williams' 1982 game Joust. Like its predecessor, Joust 2 is a 2D aerial combat game with platforms to land on. The player uses a button and joystick to control a knight riding a flying <b>ostrich.</b> The object is to progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards. Joust 2 features improved audio-visuals and new features such as mutant buzzards created by eggs falling into lava, the ability to transform from an <b>ostrich</b> to a flying horse, and differently themed levels. Waves no longer seamlessly flow into each other; the gameplay is divided into separate screens with transitions between them.|$|E

50|$|In 1988-89, the <b>ostriches,</b> {{originally}} {{taken from}} Sudan, {{were introduced to}} National Wildlife Research Center in Saudi Arabia. A reintroduction project using the North African <b>ostriches</b> was set up at Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area in 1994. Currently, {{it is estimated that}} 90 to 100 individuals are living within the reserve. It was proposed that the North African <b>ostriches</b> should also reintroduced to Al-Khunfah Protected Area.|$|R
5|$|Nasreen Munni Kabir, {{author of}} The Immortal Dialogue of K. Asif's Mughal-e-Azam, {{compared}} {{the film to}} the Koh-i-Noor diamond for its enduring worth to Indian cinema.

5|$|Chicken now {{provides}} some 20% {{of the animal}} protein eaten by the world's human population {{in the form of}} meat and eggs. Chickens are often raised intensively in battery farms; this facilitates production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds. Other species including ducks, geese, pheasants, guineafowl and turkeys are significant economically around the world. Less commonly-raised species such as the <b>ostrich</b> are starting to be farmed for their meat, which is low in cholesterol; they have also been kept for their feathers, and for leather from their skin.|$|E
5|$|In the Quadrigae Tyrannorum (Four tyrants: The Lives of Firmus, Saturninus, Proculus and Bonosus), {{the author}} {{includes}} Firmus, {{said to have}} been a usurper in Egypt under Aurelian. There is no certainty that this person ever existed; however, there was a Corrector named Claudius Firmus stationed in Egypt in 274, about the time Zosimus states that Aurelian was dealing with some trouble in that province. Nevertheless, the History's wealth of detail about him is considered to be completely invented. For example, he would eat an <b>ostrich</b> a day, he had a carriage drawn by ostriches, he would swim among crocodiles, he built himself a house fitted with square panels of glass.|$|E

5000|$|Greve and Harrison (1980) {{described}} {{the first case}} of philophthalmiasis in captive reared <b>ostriches</b> in the United States. An outbreak of Philophthalmus gralli {{has been reported in}} 2005 in <b>ostriches</b> in Zimbabwe. 17 commercially reared <b>ostriches</b> were found to be infected by this parasite. The birds had swollen eyes and severe conjunctivitis and constant lacrimation accompanied by a purulent exudates. A fraction of the birds became semi-blind from the infection.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ostriches</b> are {{wild birds}} that occur {{naturally}} in Africa. There are well {{adapted to the}} dry conditions of Namibia and can go for long periods without water. Domesticated <b>ostriches</b> are normally smaller than the wild ones.|$|R
5|$|In the {{improved}} vigilance effect, groups {{are able to}} detect predators sooner than solitary individuals. For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, wood pigeon flocks are preyed upon by goshawks. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they are when attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger the flock size, {{the more likely it}} is that one bird will notice the hawk sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon flies off in alarm, the rest of the pigeons follow. Wild ostriches in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the <b>ostrich</b> group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises it head to look for predators decreases. Because ostriches are able to run at speeds that exceed those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an <b>ostrich</b> when its head is down. By grouping, the ostriches present the lions with greater difficulty in determining how long the ostriches' heads stay down. Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases.|$|E
5|$|Lucasfilm's Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) {{created the}} visual effects sequences. The script called for Willow to restore Fin Raziel (Patricia Hayes) from a goat to her human form. Willow recites {{what he thinks}} is the {{appropriate}} spell, but turns the goat into an <b>ostrich,</b> a peacock, a tortoise, and finally a tiger, before returning her to normal. ILM supervisor Dennis Muren considered using stop motion animation for the scene. He also explained that another traditional and practical way in the late-1980s to execute this sequence would have been through the use of an optical dissolve with cutaways at various stages.|$|E
5|$|Steaks {{are also}} cut from grazing animals, usually farmed, other than cattle, {{including}} bison, camel, goat, horse, kangaroo, sheep, <b>ostrich,</b> pigs, reindeer, turkey, deer and zebu {{as well as}} various types of fish, especially salmon and large pelagic fish such as swordfish, shark and marlin. For some meats, such as pork, lamb and mutton, chevon and veal, these cuts are {{often referred to as}} chops. Some cured meat, such as gammon, is commonly served as steak.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} verify the {{occurrence}} of antibodies againstToxoplasma gondii in rheas (Rhea americana) and <b>ostriches</b> (Struthio camelus) commercially breeding in Brazil. Blood samples from 20 rheas and 46 <b>ostriches</b> (young and adults) were serologically tested using a technique known as modified agglutination test (MAT) at an initial titration of 1 : 16 for <b>ostriches</b> and 1 : 25 for rheas. Antibodies against T. gondii were found in 50 % (10 / 20) of the rheas, with titers ranging from 1 : 25 to 1 : 6, 400. The incidence of antibodies against T. gondii in <b>ostriches</b> was 17. 4 % (8 / 46) with titers ranging from 1 : 16 to 1 : 256. Birds showing titers higher than 1 : 200 forT. gondii were mainly the young ones. Therefore, rheas and <b>ostriches</b> may be parasitized by T. gondii, showing high levels of antibodies against this parasite...|$|R

5|$|The emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) is {{the second-largest}} living bird by height, after its ratite relative, the <b>ostrich.</b> It is endemic to Australia {{where it is}} the largest native bird and the only extant member of the genus Dromaius. The emu's range covers most of {{mainland}} Australia, but the Tasmanian emu and King Island emu subspecies became extinct after the European settlement of Australia in 1788. The bird is sufficiently common for it to be rated as a least-concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|The raphines are {{sometimes}} separated {{as a distinct}} family Raphidae, and their affinities were for long uncertain. They were initially placed in the ratites due to their peculiar, flightlessness-related apomorphies, and a relationship to the Rallidae has also been suggested. Osteological and molecular data, however, agrees that placement in the Columbidae is more appropriate. Many different affinities have historically been suggested for the dodo, including {{that it was a}} small <b>ostrich,</b> a rail, an albatross, or a vulture.|$|E
5|$|This large kiwi {{is one of}} five {{species of}} kiwis {{residing}} in New Zealand. The other four are the tokoeka (Apteryx australis), Okarito brown kiwi (Apteryx rowi), little spotted kiwi (Apteryx owenii), and North Island brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli). Great spotted kiwis are related most closely to the little spotted kiwi. The kiwi genus, Apteryx, is endemic to New Zealand, 44% of the bird species native to New Zealand are endemic. Kiwis are placed in the ratite family, which also includes the emu, <b>ostrich,</b> rhea, and cassowary. All ratites are flightless. Kiwi are closely related to the extinct moa bird that once inhabited New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|It {{also has}} been reintroduced in the Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve from Israel as well and some will {{eventually}} be released in open fields of the Negev desert. However, the reintroduction failed, as the reintroduced <b>ostriches</b> vanished. The red-necked <b>ostriches</b> were previously found at the Eilat mountains, the Negev desert and the southern Arabah desert. It is thought that the vanished species may have left Israel for Egypt or the Nahal Seifim. The reintroduction project for the <b>ostriches</b> was on hiatus, but the authority might try again in the future. It is hoped that Jordan and Egypt would collaborate with Israel {{to ensure that the}} <b>ostriches</b> can live in a broader range.|$|R

5|$|Animals {{can be kept}} {{extensively}} or intensively. Extensive systems involve animals roaming at will, {{or under}} the supervision of a herdsman, often for their protection from predators. Ranching in the Western United States involves large herds of cattle grazing widely over public and private lands. Similar cattle stations are found in South America, Australia and other places with large areas of land and low rainfall. Similar ranching systems have been used for sheep, deer, <b>ostrich,</b> emu, llama and alpaca. In the uplands of the United Kingdom, sheep are turned out on the fells in spring and graze the abundant mountain grasses untended, being brought to lower altitudes late in the year, with supplementary feeding being provided in winter. In rural locations, pigs and poultry can obtain much of their nutrition from scavenging, and in African communities, hens may live for months without being fed, and still produce one or two eggs a week.|$|E
5|$|From 1962-70, {{he worked}} as a {{technician}} at the Chester Beatty cancer research laboratory in Fulham, looking after animals used in experimentation. Most of the technicians were socialists, and Livingstone helped found a branch of the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs to fight redundancies imposed by company bosses. Livingstone's leftist views solidified upon the election of Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson in 1964. With a friend from Chester Beatty, Livingstone toured West Africa in 1966, visiting Algeria, Niger, Nigeria, Lagos, Ghana and Togo. Interested in the region's wildlife, Livingstone rescued an infant <b>ostrich</b> from being eaten, donating it to Lagos children's zoo. Returning home, he took part in several protest marches {{as a part of the}} anti-Vietnam War movement, becoming increasingly interested in politics and briefly subscribing to the publication of a libertarian socialist group, Solidarity.|$|E
