5|$|All {{described}} {{specimens of}} Sinosauropteryx preserve integumentary structures (filaments {{arising from the}} skin) which most palaeontologists interpret as very primitive type <b>of</b> <b>feathers.</b> These short, down-like filaments are preserved along the back half of the skull, the arms, neck, back, and {{top and bottom of}} the tail. Additional patches <b>of</b> <b>feathers</b> have been identified {{on the sides of the}} body, and palaeontologists Chen, Dong and Zheng proposed that the density of the feathers on the back and the randomness of the patches elsewhere on the body indicated the animals would have been fully feathered in life, with the ventral feathers having been removed by decomposition.|$|E
5|$|Feathers are {{a feature}} {{characteristic}} of birds (though {{also present in}} some dinosaurs not currently considered to be true birds). They facilitate flight, provide insulation that aids in thermoregulation, and are used in display, camouflage, and signalling. There are several types <b>of</b> <b>feathers,</b> each serving {{its own set of}} purposes. Feathers are epidermal growths attached to the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called pterylae. The distribution pattern of these feather tracts (pterylosis) is used in taxonomy and systematics. The arrangement and appearance <b>of</b> <b>feathers</b> on the body, called plumage, may vary within species by age, social status, and sex.|$|E

5|$|Most {{of these}} eleven fossils include {{impressions}} <b>of</b> <b>feathers.</b> Because these feathers are of an advanced form (flight feathers), these fossils are {{evidence that the}} evolution <b>of</b> <b>feathers</b> began before the Late Jurassic. The type specimen of Archaeopteryx was discovered just two years after Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species. Archaeopteryx seemed to confirm Darwin's theories and has since become a key piece of evidence for the origin of birds, the transitional fossils debate, and confirmation of evolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} dromaeosaurid with {{definitive}} evidence <b>of</b> <b>feathers</b> was Sinornithosaurus, reported from China by Xu et al. in 1999. Many other dromaeosaurid fossils {{have been found}} with feathers covering their bodies, some with fully developed feathered wings. Microraptor even shows evidence of a second pair of wings on the hind legs. While direct feather impressions are only possible in fine-grained sediments, some fossils found in coarser rocks show evidence <b>of</b> <b>feathers</b> {{by the presence of}} quill knobs, the attachment points for wing feathers possessed by some birds. The dromaeosaurids Rahonavis and Velociraptor have both been found with quill knobs, showing that these forms had feathers despite no impressions having been found. In light of this, it is most likely that even the larger ground-dwelling dromaeosaurids bore feathers, since even flightless birds today retain most of their plumage, and relatively large dromaeosaurids, like Velociraptor, are known to have retained pennaceous feathers. Though some scientists had suggested that the larger dromaeosaurids lost some or all of their insulatory covering, the discovery <b>of</b> <b>feathers</b> in Velociraptor specimens has been cited as evidence that all members of the family retained feathers.|$|E

30|$|In the {{application}} <b>of</b> the treated <b>feather</b> as fertilizer, {{most of the}} previous works have been focused only on product analysis and nutrient release characteristics, but {{little is known about}} its effects and further applications on the plant growth.

In this study, the positive effect <b>of</b> <b>feather</b> hydrolysate on the productivity and product quality was reported.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present new {{insights}} and promising directions for future research on feather pecking in laying hens. Our starting point was a multidisciplinary research program on feather pecking in The Netherlands, in which ethological, physiological, ontogenetic and genetic approaches were combined. The four topics addressed in this paper are: (1) the relation between gentle and severe feather pecking, (2) feather pecking and coping strategy, (3) causation <b>of</b> <b>feather</b> pecking, and (4) the possibility to solve the problem <b>of</b> <b>feather</b> pecking through genetic selection. When the relationship between gentle and severe feather pecking was studied, it was found that both forms <b>of</b> <b>feather</b> pecking are related at the same age. Gentle feather pecking at young age, however, could not be used as a predictor <b>of</b> <b>feather</b> pecking at adult age. Birds from high and low feather pecking lines that showed differences in feather pecking also differed in other behavioural and physiological characteristics. This may reflect line differences in coping strategy. Relating coping strategy with feather pecking may help us to better understand the motivations and characteristics underlying the development <b>of</b> <b>feather</b> pecking. On the causation <b>of</b> <b>feather</b> pecking, there is some evidence that it is redirected ground pecking, deriving either from a foraging or a dustbathing background. However, evidence was found that early feather pecking could also be interpreted as social exploration. Finally, the use of molecular genetics to help solving the problem <b>of</b> <b>feather</b> pecking seems promising. Feather pecking has been shown to be heritable and the first genetic regions (QTL) involved in feather pecking have been identified. To search for a solution for the feather pecking problem it is of importance to identify the mechanisms involved in the development <b>of</b> <b>feather</b> pecking. In this paper, we have combined approaches from different disciplines in order to study feather pecking. The results indicate that combined efforts of multidisciplinary research can be very useful in looking for possible ways to reduce feather pecking in practic...|$|R
40|$|Several samples <b>of</b> <b>feather</b> meal {{evaluated}} at this laboratory {{during the}} past several years [I] were found to have metabolizable energy values far in excess of the 2360 kcal/kg (1073 kcalflb) reported by the National Re-search Council [2]. Values obtained were in reasonable agreement with the higher values for feather meal determined in both Europe [3] and Canada [4]. Because of the magnitude of difference between our initial results and NRC values, a broader investigation of the metabolizable energy <b>of</b> U. S. <b>feather</b> meals was initiated. The need for accurate information on the energy content <b>of</b> <b>feather</b> meals is <b>of</b> import-ance to both the renderer and the nutritionist. The feeding value <b>of</b> <b>feather</b> meal is affected not only by protein content, but also by energy. Thus, if the energy <b>of</b> <b>feather</b> meal is underval-ued at the present time, it {{is in the interest of}} the rendering industry to have this error cor-rected. For poultry nutritionists, the relation-ship between energy and nutrients is important: if the energy content <b>of</b> <b>feather</b> meal is underestimated, then its inclusion in poultry diets will lead to wider ca 1 orie:protein ratios, and may contribute to excess fat accu-mulation.

5|$|A {{small number}} of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their flight {{feathers}} at once, temporarily becoming flightless. As a general rule, the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair. Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae. The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers, in that it begins with the second innermost pair <b>of</b> <b>feathers</b> and finishes with the central pair <b>of</b> <b>feathers</b> so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail. The general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward, secondaries inward, and the tail from centre outward. Before nesting, the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly. The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation.|$|E

40|$|THE {{differences}} wich {{exist in}} rate <b>of</b> <b>feathering</b> <b>of</b> various breeds have be-come {{a major problem}} in the production of high quality broilers. The discrimina-tion of the market against "bare backs" has influenced poultry breeders to en-deavor to develop strains of heavy breeds that are well feathered at the bfpiler age. Observation of the growing chick has shown two major genetic types of feather-ing, namely, early and late. Serebrovsky (1922) reported evidence that a sex-linked gene affects the rate <b>of</b> <b>feathering.</b> Warren (1925) confirmed the findings of Sere-brovsky. The dominant gene is late feathering which is typical of most heavy breeds, and its recessive allelomorph, early feathering, is found in the Mediterranean breeds. The gene controls the rate <b>of</b> <b>feathering</b> from hatching throughout the growing period. Warren (1933) described another type, retarded feathering, which behaves as a simple autosomal recessive factor. Its in-fluence is to modify the number of second-aries of the day-old chick and inhibit the appearance <b>of</b> tail <b>feathers</b> for several weeks. Radi and Warren (1938) studied the <b>feathering</b> <b>of</b> a strain of Rhode Island...|$|R
5|$|As {{with other}} ratites, emus have a {{relatively}} low basal metabolic rate compared to other types of birds.

5|$|Clan chieftains, like clan chiefs, may {{wear their}} own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed with their own motto or slogan. Clan chieftains may also wear two small eagle feathers (unlike the chief's three). On certain occasions real eagle feathers may be worn behind the crest badge. If a clan chieftain {{is a member of}} the British Peerage or a feudal baron they are permitted to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their crest badge. Recently feudal barons have taken to wearing two eagle feathers behind their armiger's badge but there is no ancient tradition of this and it is solely based upon the fact that anciently feudal barons were most likely to have been chiefs or chieftains. If the feudal baron is a member of a clan it is advisable to consult the clan chief on clan customs and traditions. The Lord Lyon only gives guidance and not governance on the wearing <b>of</b> <b>feathers</b> and recommends consulting with a clan chief who approves the number <b>of</b> <b>feathers</b> worn by members of the clan.|$|E
