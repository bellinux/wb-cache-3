In addition, she cannot return to work until she is done with her training. Liz, however, cannot handle life without work, as she needs the stress. Her attitude changes when she meets one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbors,</b> Emily (Elizabeth Marvel). She understands how Liz feels because she was just like Liz and tells her there are better ways to live. Liz hangs out with Emily and her friends (Mary Catherine Garrison, Kerry Butler, and Christina Gausas), who spend majority of their time getting spa treatments and going shopping. Liz gets {{so caught up in}} their lifestyle that she forgets to watch her show, The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS). Not wanting to come back to work—as she is intrigued by her new friends' lifestyle—Liz sexually harasses her counselor, Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane). She goes back to hanging out with Emily and her friends, but soon discovers that they are a Girl Fight Club, which disappoints Liz. In order for her to get out, Liz needs to fight them.|$|E
25|$|Cason was {{represented}} {{by one of the}} first female lawyers in Florida, Kate Walton. Cason was reportedly profane indeed (one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbors</b> reported her swearing could be heard for a quarter of a mile), wore pants, had a fascination with guns, and was just as extraordinarily independent as Rawlings herself.|$|E

25|$|David and Paige Walling {{are best}} friends with Terry and Cathy Ostroff, their neighbors on Orange Drive in {{suburban}} West Orange, New Jersey. Their comfortable existence goes awry when prodigal daughter Nina Ostroff, newly {{broken up with}} her fiancé Ethan, returns home for Thanksgiving after a five-year absence. Rather than developing {{an interest in the}} successful son <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbors,</b> Toby Walling, which would please both families, it is David who captures Nina's attention. When the connection between Nina and David is discovered, everyone's lives are thrown into upheaval, particularly Vanessa Walling's, Nina's childhood best friend.

500|$|In 1656, Wilson and John Norton {{were the}} two ministers of the Boston church when the widow Ann Hibbins was convicted of {{witchcraft}} by the General Court and executed in Boston. [...] Hibbins' husband died in 1654, and the unhappy widow was first tried the next year following complaints <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbors</b> about her behavior. [...] Details of the event are lacking, because the great Boston journalist, John Winthrop was dead, and the next generations of note takers, Increase Mather and Cotton Mather had not yet emerged. [...] A 1684 letter, however, survives, written by a Reverend Beach in Jamaica to Increase Mather in New England. [...] In the letter Beach stated that he, Wilson and others were guests at Norton's table when Norton made the statement {{that the only reason}} Hibbins was executed was because she had more wit than her neighbors, thus implying her innocence. [...] The sentiments of Wilson are not specifically expressed in the letter, though several writers have inferred that his sentiments were the same as Norton's.|$|E
500|$|Although he {{was trying}} new things musically, Ochs did not abandon his protest roots. He was profoundly {{concerned}} with the escalation of the Vietnam War, performing tirelessly at anti-war rallies across the country. In 1967 he organized two rallies to declare that [...] "The War Is Over"—"Is everybody sick of this stinking war? In that case, friends, do what I {{and thousands of other}} Americans have done—declare the war over."—one in Los Angeles in June, the other in New York in November. He continued to write and record anti-war songs, such as [...] "The War Is Over" [...] and [...] "White Boots Marching in a Yellow Land". Other topical songs of this period include [...] "Outside of a Small Circle of Friends", inspired by the murder of Kitty Genovese, who was stabbed to death outside of her New York City apartment building while dozens <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbors</b> reportedly ignored her cries for help, and [...] "William Butler Yeats Visits Lincoln Park and Escapes Unscathed", about the despair he felt {{in the aftermath of the}} Chicago 1968 Democratic National Convention police riot.|$|E
5000|$|A third {{standalone}} single, [...] "Anti-Gravity," [...] {{was released}} in August 2012. The song was written by Curtis {{on the occasion of}} the death <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbor,</b> opera composer Daniel Catán.|$|R

500|$|Summed up by James Dinh of MTV News, [...] " [...] 'Party' takes viewers {{back to an}} old-school {{backyard}} celebration full {{of colorful}} bikinis, freestyle dancing and a few familiar faces. Throughout the video, [...] lets loose, playing a sort of party host. If she is not lounging in beach chairs, she is dancing among her friends or mowing the lawn." [...] The clip is centered around a trailer park hood and a subsequent soiree. It starts with a dog barking behind a fencing, followed by multiple intercut scenery, which includes two men engaged in a conversation, a woman leaning against a car, a little girl riding a bicycle and a saucepan caught in fire. Then, Beyoncé appears, dressed in bright colored as well as flashy garments, sporting neon-colored oval shaped nails, and bright-colored lipstick. She is cooking in a skillet while one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbors</b> drinks from a hose. As she sings, looking into the camera, she highlights and plays with her hair. The action shifts from the double wide to a sunny summer backyard barbecue, where Beyoncé and her friends dance as Solange is deejaying. This is followed by scenes of Beyoncé, floating in an above ground pool while singing and entertaining her guests. She is wearing a pink one-piece swimsuit, dropping earrings and her hair looks crimped. Other girls bask {{in the sun and}} splash in the pool as Solange works the turntables.|$|E
2500|$|Schlessinger was {{estranged from}} her sister for years, and many {{thought she was}} an only child. She had not spoken to her mother for 18 to 20 years before her mother's death in 2002 from heart disease. Her mother's remains were found in her Beverly Hills condo {{approximately}} two months after she died, and lay unclaimed for {{some time in the}} Los Angeles morgue before Schlessinger had them picked up for burial. Concerning the day that she heard about her mother’s death, she said: “Apparently she had no friends and none <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbors</b> were close, so nobody even noticed! How sad.” In 2006, Schlessinger wrote that she had been attacked in a [...] "vulgar, inhumane manner by media types" [...] because of the circumstances surrounding her mother's death, and that false allegations had been made that she was unfit to dispense advice based on family values. She said that she had not mourned the deaths of either of her parents because she had no emotional bond to them.|$|E

50|$|Until her death, {{she lived}} in Salt Lake City, Utah. On July 16, 2006, she {{disappeared}} from her home. Her body was found fewer than 100 feet {{from her home in}} the basement <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbor,</b> 20-year-old Craig Roger Gregerson.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think you'll soon {{be around}} agin," [...] she added, in the {{customary}} mockery {{of an attempt}} at cheer. The other woman started slightly, turned her head, and gazed on her old friend long and intently. The hollowness <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbor's</b> words stung <b>her.</b>|$|R
50|$|The book {{tells the}} story of Kate Malone, a preacher's {{daughter}} and high school student who is excellent in chemistry and aspires to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but faces multiple tragic situations ranging from rejection by MIT to the fire <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbor</b> Teri Litch at the end <b>of</b> <b>her</b> senior year.|$|R
6000|$|... "You shouldn't talk of my {{patients}} in that way, Kitty," [...] said the doctor; [...] "and {{in the opinion of}} a good many <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbors</b> the old lady is not bound for heaven." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Grant is an artist--a genius--in her way," [...] {{the hostess}} rejoined. [...] "She {{certainly}} understands semi-tropical opportunities, whereas some <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbors</b> seem only {{to think of}} the well-kept lawns of an Eastern city." ...|$|E
60|$|Here, {{to the consternation of}} Dane, who did {{not know}} that his underfed and overworked {{companion}} had done a courageous and, in the eyes <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbors,</b> a very suspicious thing, the girl broke out into half-choked sobbing.|$|E
50|$|She {{performs}} intermittent assassinations {{while trying}} to earn money and to have her passport returned to her so she can return to Ukraine and re-unite with her daughter. She is troubled, though, by the noise <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbor</b> constantly beating his wife Elinor (Ninette Tayeb). She reaches out to <b>her</b> <b>neighbor</b> and offers friendship, as she can relate to her situation having formerly also been a battered wife.|$|R
40|$|After {{the break}} up <b>of</b> <b>her</b> marriage, Kate is left {{living in the}} country with her daughter. Adding to her frustrations are the patronizing attitudes of the local farmers and the {{constant}} barking <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbor’s</b> dog. When <b>her</b> daughter is bitten, she opts for the practical rural solution, and sets out to kill the dog. Things do not go as planned. ...|$|R

Meanwhile, Logan (Jason Dohring) and Weevil (Francis Capra) have to deal with each other in detention.|$|R
60|$|Vane sat silent {{a moment}} or two. He had noticed the brief pause and fancied that she had changed one of the words that {{followed}} it. He {{did not think that}} it was the opinions <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbors</b> against which she chafed most.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Morris was {{apparently}} a widow who lived {{alone with her}} two boys, and, having this refugee in her house, she was naturally very nervous about {{the movements of the}} American troops and the actions <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbors</b> of the opposite party.|$|E
60|$|Looking back, she saw Lucretia lying at length, with {{closed eyes}} and hollow cheeks. She {{seemed to be}} sleeping, half buried in the grass. She {{did not look up}} nor reply to her sister-in-law, whose life was one of toil and trouble also, but not so hard and {{helpless}} as Lucretia's. By contrast with most <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbors,</b> she seemed comfortable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{there it}} is on your own nose. Don't you {{remember}} you put it there because you said mine was not {{big enough to hold}} it?" [...] laughed Jill, tweaking a large orange square off the round nose <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbor,</b> causing it to wrinkle up in a droll way, as the gum made the operation slightly painful.|$|R
60|$|Down {{between the}} rows of little tables tripped Medora, of the Green Mountains, after her escort.

50|$|Kimberly LaGayle McCarthy (May 11, 1961 - June 26, 2013) was an American {{death row}} inmate who was {{convicted and sentenced to}} death for the 1997 murder <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbor,</b> 71-year-old retired college {{professor}} Dorothy Booth, in her Lancaster, Texas (Dallas-Fort Worth area) home during a robbery. She was also a suspect in the murders of two other elderly Texas women, for which she was never tried.|$|R
60|$|There was {{an element}} of shrewdness and sell-analysis in Mrs. Folsom which saved her from being grotesque. She knew she was queer to Mrs. Bloom, {{but she did not}} resent it. She was still young in form and face, but her teeth were gone, and, like so many <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbors,</b> she was too poor to replace them from the dentist's. She wore a decent calico dress and a shawl and hat.|$|E
6000|$|Now it {{was early}} summer, and my {{grandmother}} and I were again in our dear home in the village. As I have said, she was sitting by the open window, where she could look out upon the flowers, the grass, and {{a little of the}} life <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbors.</b> I sat near her, and had been telling her of my three days in the Forest of Arden, and of the veritable Jaques whom I met there, when she remarked:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|This, {{by dint of}} Scottish economy, {{backed by}} filial reverence and pride, she accomplished, though in the effort, she {{subjected}} herself to every privation. Not content with this, she in certain instances refused to take pay for the tuition {{of the children of}} some <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighbors,</b> who had befriended her father in his need, and had since fallen into poverty. [...] "In a word," [...] added Scott, [...] "she is a fine old Scotch girl; and I delight in her, more than in many a fine lady I have known, and I have known many of the finest." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} part of the series, she lives on the Upper East Side, but ends up moving to an {{expensive}} apartment in the Meatpacking District. The move is provoked after one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> late-night visitors lets in a mugger who attacks one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> older female <b>neighbors</b> and Samantha incurs the wrath of a tribelike commune <b>of</b> <b>her</b> elderly <b>neighbors.</b>|$|R

Family and friends were initially outraged after the search ended, and accused authorities of mishandling the investigation.
