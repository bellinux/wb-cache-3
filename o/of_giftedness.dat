5|$|A major {{point of}} {{consensus}} among all scholars of intellectual giftedness {{is that there}} is no generally agreed definition <b>of</b> <b>giftedness.</b> Although there is no scholarly agreement about identifying gifted learners, there is a de facto reliance on IQ scores for identifying participants in school gifted education programs.

500|$|As {{long ago}} as 1937, Lewis Terman pointed out that error of {{estimation}} in IQ scoring increases as IQ score increases, {{so that there is}} less and less certainty about assigning a test-taker to one band of scores or another as one looks at higher bands. Current IQ tests also have large error bands for high IQ scores. As an underlying reality, such distinctions as those between [...] "exceptionally gifted" [...] and [...] "profoundly gifted" [...] have never been well established. All longitudinal studies of IQ have shown that test-takers can bounce up and down in score, and thus switch up and down in rank order as compared to one another, over the course of childhood. Some test-givers claim that IQ classification categories such as [...] "profoundly gifted" [...] are meaningful, but those are based on the obsolete Stanford–Binet Third Revision (Form L-M) test. The highest reported standard score for most IQ tests is IQ 160, approximately the 99.997th percentile (leaving aside the issue of the considerable error in measurement at that level of IQ on any IQ test). IQ scores above this level are dubious as there are insufficient normative cases upon which to base a statistically justified rank-ordering. Moreover, there has never been any validation of the Stanford–Binet L-M on adult populations, and there is no trace of such terminology in the writings of Lewis Terman. Although two current tests attempt to provide [...] "extended norms" [...] that allow for classification of different levels <b>of</b> <b>giftedness,</b> those norms are not based on well validated data.|$|E

The results of the study indicate that traces of resilient coping amongst the participating group of children do exist, and that these traces are closely related to the manifestation of emotional intelligence. Themes indicative of children’s resilient coping include a sense of self-worth (based on added responsibility and related to education), the presence of hope and optimism, a sense of security, comfort and belonging (based on knowledge of future caregivers and remaining in a familiar community), as well as selfregulation capacity.

That is, we want to investigate if variance in identification may be explained by variance in mathematical abilities exhibited by these individuals. To achieve these goals, this study proposes a new domain-specific identification instrument for the assessment <b>of</b> mathematical <b>giftedness,</b> assessing mathematical abilities and creativity. The study was conducted among 359 4 th, 5 th and 6 th grade elementary school students in Cyprus, using two instruments measuring mathematical ability and mathematical creativity and fluid intelligence.

Moreover, the analysis illustrated that intelligence is a predictor <b>of</b> mathematical <b>giftedness.</b> Furthermore, the analysis revealed that different groups of students are identified by each type of testing; that is, through the mathematical instrument and the intelligence instrument.

It examined the influence of levels <b>of</b> mathematical <b>giftedness</b> and levels <b>of</b> verbal <b>giftedness</b> on moral reasoning and identity development. The relationship between moral reasoning and identity status was also explored. This research used a non-experimental comparative design employing a survey questionnaire.

The comparison group of students not identified as gifted (n = 32) was recruited from independent secondary schools (Years 9 to 12) in New South Wales, through nomination by their teachers who were trained in gifted education. Student samples from both groups were administered the Defining Issues Test (DIT) and the Extended Objective Measure of Ego Identity Status- 2 (EOM-EIS- 2). Results showed that gifted adolescents scored significantly higher in the DIT postconventional index than their age peers not identified as gifted. Highly mathematically gifted students were more advanced in moral reasoning than moderately mathematically gifted students. Female adolescents who were highly verbally gifted had significantly higher scores on the postconventional index than did those who were moderately verbally gifted. In terms of ego identity status, gifted and non-identified groups did not differ in the development of ideological identity.
