25|$|Qantas Flight 32: an Airbus A380 {{flying from}} London Heathrow to Sydney (via Singapore) in 2010 had an {{uncontained}} failure in a Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine. The failure {{was found to}} have been caused by a misaligned counter bore within a stub <b>oil</b> <b>pipe</b> leading to a fatigue fracture. This in turn led to an oil leakage followed by an oil fire in the engine. The fire led to the release of the Intermediate Pressure Turbine (IPT) disc. The airplane, however, landed safely. This led to the grounding of the entire Qantas A380 fleet.|$|E
25|$|During the 2011 Avalon Airshow, Rolls-Royce faced {{questions}} concerning incidents with its Trent 900 Turbofan used {{to power the}} Airbus A380 aircraft. One of the engines suffered a partial power loss during a Qantas flight in February 2011. This followed an incident in November 2010 in which an engine disintegrated in flight causing Qantas Flight 32 to make an emergency landing in Singapore. The aircraft was extensively damaged and the airline grounded its fleet of A380s. The problem was traced to a fatigue crack in an <b>oil</b> <b>pipe</b> requiring the replacement of some engines and modifications to the design. Trent-powered A380s operated by Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines were also affected. Qantas gradually returned its A380s to service over several months. In June 2011 the airline announced it had agreed to compensation of US$100m from Rolls-Royce.|$|E

25|$|Qantas Flight 32 was a Qantas {{scheduled}} passenger {{flight that}} suffered an uncontained engine failure on 4 November 2010 {{and made an}} emergency landing at Singapore Changi Airport. The failure {{was the first of}} its kind for the Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger aircraft. It marked the first aviation occurrence involving an Airbus A380. On inspection it was found that a turbine disc in the aircraft's No.2 Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine (on the port side nearest the fuselage) had disintegrated. In addition to destruction of the engine, this caused damage to the nacelle, wing, fuel system, landing gear, flight controls, the controls for engine No.1 and a fire in the left inner wing fuel tank that self-extinguished. The failure was determined to have been caused by the breaking of a stub <b>oil</b> <b>pipe</b> which had been manufactured improperly.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} Vanwall Special (the Cooper T30, {{according to}} factory records) was {{built at the}} Cooper factory and used a similar front-engined chassis design to Cooper's own Formula Two machines, but was designed {{from the ground up}} by Maddock. The chassis was described by test driver Alan Brown as being much more taut and well engineered than previous Cooper products. Brown gave the car its race debut in May 1954 at the International Trophy meeting at Silverstone Circuit. He was running as high as third place before an <b>oil</b> <b>pipe</b> coupling failed and forced the car into retirement. For the Championship season Vandervell employed the up-and-coming Peter Collins to drive the car. Seventh place at the 1954 Italian Grand Prix and second in the non-Championship Goodwood Trophy race were the best he achieved, before he wrote the vehicle off during practice for the Spanish Grand Prix that October.|$|E
25|$|Marden {{remained}} in {{use as a}} civil Emergency Landing Ground. On 27 October 1919, a Handley Page O/400 of Handley Page Transport landed at Marden due to strong winds preventing it reaching Croydon. On 13 August 1923, de Havilland DH.34 G-EBBW of Instone Air Line landed at Marden due to a broken <b>oil</b> <b>pipe.</b> The aircraft was repaired and returned to Croydon. One Wednesday in September 1927, an Air Union aircraft on a flight from Paris to Croydon landed at Marden due to engine trouble. Another aircraft was sent from Croydon to collect the 11 passengers {{and take them to}} their destination. Marden was still in operation in 1934, when it was mentioned in Kelly's Directory for Kent. In August 1934, a de Havilland Leopard Moth on a flight from Heston to St Inglevert, France made a landing at Marden as a child passenger was suffering from airsickness. The flight was resumed after the child had recovered. Marden closed on 24 June 1935, and the land then reverted to farmland. A RAF wireless station was based on the site during the Second World War. The last aircraft to land at Marden was on 10 October 1940, during the Battle of Britain, when a Hawker Hurricane of 253 Squadron made a forced landing and overturned, the pilot escaping with a cut thumb.|$|E

Ebiere (Mbong Amata) is born in Warri during the Military era; she concludes high school and is offered scholarship by Western Oil to study oversea. A few years later, an <b>oil</b> <b>pipe</b> in the Niger Delta bursts {{and the people of}} the community go to fetch petrol from the pipe, Dede (Hakeem Kae-Kazim), a fisherman discovers that fishes in the river have been killed by the oil spillage. The police arrive at the spillage site and demand that the Villagers vacate the area, but no one listens to them. Ebiere arrives in the village â€” her home, and is told her mother and siblings are getting fuel from a spillage site. On her way to the site, the site explodes killing her mother and siblings. The explosion appears to have been an accident, caused after one of the police officers sent to disperse the oil collectors lights a cigarette after having failed to do so. He is killed as well. Ebiere speaks up at a consolation visit of Western Oil staff (An oil rig American company based in Warri) and is applauded by members of the Community. This establishes her as one of the speakers for the Niger Delta Community, she is approached by Kate Summers (Sarah Wayne Callies), a reporter who likes her speech and says Ebiere is {{different from the rest of}} the community people, Kate becomes one of Ebiere's friends and supporters. Ebiere starts to organize peaceful protests and mass rallies for their voice to be heard, fighting for the Niger Delta to be cleaned up and well maintained â€” they are sometimes beaten, killed and/or arrested by the Military in the process. Ebiere is offered bribes severally by Western Oil representatives to stop her from instigating the people, but she always declines.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{building}} of the causeway, a [...] landfill was built near the river. Various materials were disposed of in the area, including petroleum waste <b>oil,</b> <b>pipe</b> and foam insulation, sewage sludge, and medical waste. While the landfill was shut down in 1992, samples by the Environmental Bureau of Investigation and the Petitcodiac Riverkeeper showed that ammonium levels around the leachate exceeded Canadian quality guidelines by as much as 15 times, and contained heavy metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, and PCBs. A mortality rate of 100percent was found for test trout and daphnia when exposed to water samples. Gemtec Limited, the company responsible for planning and closing the landfill, and the City of Moncton were charged on 12 March 2002, for offences relating to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (1999) and the Fisheries Act. The city pleaded guilty on 23 September 2003, paid a $35,000 fine, and was ordered to help reduce the leachate flow from the landfill. Three years later, Gemtec Limited was fined a total of $6,000 and was ordered to contribute a total of $22,000 to the federal Environmental Damages Fund and the Jonathan Creek Committee.|$|E

Company officers had already identified a site in Kent of [...] alongside the Milwaukie-Union Pacific rail line near the I-405 freeway. Construction on the $1.5 million plant began in 1974, and by spring 1975, the merger was underway, with 75 employees joining together in the renamed Seattle-Tacoma Box Company. Both the Seattle and Tacoma properties were sold to help finance the new property.
