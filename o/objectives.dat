5|$|Design {{managers}} often {{operate in}} the area of design leadership; however, design management and design leadership are interdependent rather than interchangeable. Like management and leadership, they differ in their <b>objectives,</b> achievements of <b>objectives,</b> accomplishments, and outcomes. Design leadership leads from creation of a vision to changes, innovations, and implementation of creative solutions. It stimulates communication and collaboration through motivation, sets ambitions, and points out future directions to achieve long-term <b>objectives.</b> In contrast, design management is reactive and responds to a given business situation by using specific skills, tools, methods, and techniques. Design management requires design leadership to know where to go and design leadership requires design management to know how to get there.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{explore the}} {{potential}} of adding <b>objective</b> functions to OCL operation contracts. If an operation contract includes an <b>objective</b> function, the operation has the obligation to yield results that make the <b>objective</b> function assume an optimal value. Thus, an <b>objective</b> function expresses a preference among the possible operation results that conform to the postconditions of the operation contract and any class invariants. <b>Objective</b> functions strictly increase the expressiveness of OCL operation contracts. While <b>objective</b> functions arise naturally in application domains like operations research, we argue that <b>objective</b> functions are a useful general-purpose specification instrument and discuss several application examples. As tool support for operation contracts with <b>objective</b> functions, we present an animator for OCL operation contracts with optimization capabilities. We ensure tool interoperability by specifying <b>objective</b> functions in a UML profile...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{policy makers and}} social {{scientists}} have devoted considerable attention to wellbeing, a concept that refers to people’s capacity to live healthy, creative and fulfilling lives. Two conceptual approaches dominate wellbeing research. The <b>objective</b> approach examines the <b>objective</b> components of a good life. The subjective approach examines people’s subjective evaluations of their lives. In the <b>objective</b> approach how subjective wellbeing relates to <b>objective</b> wellbeing is not a relevant research question. The subjective approach does investigate how <b>objective</b> wellbeing relates to subjective wellbeing, but has focused primarily on one <b>objective</b> wellbeing indicator, income, rather than the comprehensive indicator set implied by the <b>objective</b> approach. This paper attempts to contribute by examining relationships between a comprehensive set of <b>objective</b> wellbeing measures and subjective wellbeing, and by linking wellbeing research to inequality research by also investigating how subjective and <b>objective</b> wellbeing relate to class, gender, age and ethnicity. We use three waves of a representative state-level household panel study from Queensland, Australia, undertaken from 2008 to 2010, to investigate how <b>objective</b> measures of wellbeing are socially distributed by gender, class, age, and ethnicity. We also examine relationships between <b>objective</b> wellbeing and overall life satisfaction, providing {{one of the first}} longitudinal analyses linking <b>objective</b> wellbeing with subjective evaluations. <b>Objective</b> aspects of wellbeing are unequally distributed by gender, age, class and ethnicity and are strongly associated with life satisfaction. Moreover, associations between gender, ethnicity, class and life satisfaction persist after controlling for <b>objective</b> wellbeing, suggesting that mechanisms in addition to <b>objective</b> wellbeing link structural dimensions of inequality to life satisfaction...|$|R

5|$|The World Is Not Enough is a first-person shooter {{based on}} MGM's 1999 James Bond {{film of the}} same name, where the player assumes the role of James Bond through 14 {{missions}} with three difficulty settings. The player {{has the ability to}} run, jump, crouch, swim and dive underwater {{for a short period of}} time. One mission is played as a rail shooter in which the player skis down a mountain. In each mission, the player must complete a number of <b>objectives</b> while defeating enemies controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. <b>Objectives</b> range from rescuing hostages to destroying vehicles and collecting items. Some <b>objectives</b> require the player to use numerous high-tech gadgets. For example, the Keypad Decrypter can be used to decode lock systems, while the ID scanner is useful to copy fingerprints.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{is divided into}} 14 missions in which the player plays as Joanna Dark. Each mission provides a number of <b>objectives</b> that the player has to complete to progress. To successfully clear a mission, the player must complete all primary <b>objectives,</b> and if Joanna is killed or fails an objective, the player will have to start the level again. The missions also feature optional <b>objectives</b> that are not critical but add to the player's overall completion score. Some <b>objectives</b> require the player to use numerous high-tech gadgets. For example, a device called Datathief allows the player to hack into electronic devices, while another called Loctopus {{can be used to}} open locked doors. Stealth is another important element of the gameplay, as the player is often given the freedom to kill enemies without being detected by sneaking up behind them. Unlike the original Perfect Dark, every mission contains a single checkpoint at which the player may restart if Joanna is killed or loses beyond that checkpoint. However, checkpoints are removed as the player plays through a higher difficulty. There are four difficulty settings through which a mission can be played: Agent, Secret Agent, Perfect Agent, and an extra one called Dark Agent, which becomes available once the player completes the entire game on Perfect Agent. As the player plays on higher difficulties, the game adds more <b>objectives</b> and makes enemies tougher to increase the challenge.|$|E

5|$|As a result, the Army Material Command (AMC) {{conducted}} a study {{to determine if the}} development <b>objectives</b> were feasible and also established a program office for the Fire-support Aerial System (FAS). AMC recommended to narrow the competition to compound helicopters, as they were considered the only helicopter configuration at the time capable of being developed to meet the <b>objectives.</b> In March 1964, the Secretary of the Army advised DDRE that modification of existing aircraft would not approach the required performance of the FAS program; the Army would continue using the armed UH-1B until development of the FAS could proceed.|$|E

The Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDRE) conditionally approved the changes to the development <b>objectives,</b> pending his review of the proposed program. He also directed the Army {{to determine whether or}} not any other helicopter could offer an improvement in performance over the UH-1B in the meantime.|$|E
40|$|<b>Objective</b> {{measures}} of performance are seldom perfect. In response, incentive contracts often include important subjective components that mitigate incentive distortions caused by imperfect <b>objective</b> measures. This paper explores the combined use of subjective and <b>objective</b> performance measures in (respectively) implicit and explicit incentive contracts. Naturally, <b>objective</b> and subjective {{measures of}}ten are substitutes, sometimes strikingly so: {{we show that}} if <b>objective</b> measures are sufficiently close to perfect then no implicit contracts are feasible (because the firm's fallback position after reneging on an implicit contact is too attractive). We also show, however, that <b>objective</b> and subjective measures can reinforce each other: if <b>objective</b> measures become more accurate then in some circumstances the optimal contract puts more weight on subjective measures (because the improved <b>objective</b> measures increase {{the value of the}} ongoing relationship, and so reduce the firm's incentive to renege). We also analyze the use of subjective weights on <b>objective</b> performance measures, and provide case-study evidence consistent with our analyses. ...|$|R
40|$|My {{research}} is about monitoring the software development process to assess Capability maturity level. Capability Maturity Model (CMM) {{was developed to}} improve the software process based on subjective assessment by teams of experts. We propose an <b>objective</b> CMM assessment, which replaces expensive and time-consuming human effort by a knowledge-based system. Compared to Subjective CMM assessment, <b>Objective</b> CMM assessment can be less expensive, takes less time, and is easy to estimate the software development environment maturity. The accuracy of <b>Objective</b> CMM assessment can {{be the same as}} Subjective CMM assessment if enough activities are represented as <b>objective</b> activities. For example, if subjective activities total 80 % and <b>objective</b> activities total 20 %, then the accuracy of <b>Objective</b> CMM assessment is not reliable. It would be reliable if the <b>objective</b> activity is increased up to 80 % from 20 %. This dissertation presents how to change from Subjective CMM assessment to <b>Objective</b> CMM assessment, and we will prove that <b>Objective</b> CMM Assessment is effective...|$|R

On 3 October, Serbian and Montenegrin representatives in the Yugoslav Presidency declared that they alone had become the acting federal presidency and assumed control of the JNA. Two days later, the JNA requested that the presidency authorize a general mobilization of forces needed for the campaign, but this was refused by Milošević.
