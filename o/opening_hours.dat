5|$|The Underground station {{underwent}} major reconstruction at {{the same}} time as the main line station, with the work being completed in 2012. From 14 December 2014, the station's <b>opening</b> <b>hours</b> changed significantly, with the station opening on Sundays and no longer closing early in the evenings. The station previously had restricted <b>opening</b> <b>hours</b> because it primarily served the local financial services sector, so there was low demand for services outside office hours. However, with the main line station's <b>opening</b> <b>hours</b> being extended due to the Thameslink Programme, the Underground station's <b>opening</b> <b>hours</b> were changed to accommodate the additional passengers.|$|E

These scenes were also a rarity for location filming; usually filming in public places was done on a Sunday during closing hours but the clubbing scenes in this episode were filmed during <b>opening</b> <b>hours</b> at the Music Box in Manchester.

40|$|Using {{the motor}} drived {{crankcase}} compression type two stroke cycle engine {{that has a}} piston valve type inlet port, the influence of inlet timing on the delivery ratio were studied. Conseqently, {{it became clear that}} : (1) Concerning the various inlet port area, the longer the inlet port <b>opening</b> <b>hour</b> is, the smaller the delivery ratio is. When the inlet port <b>opening</b> <b>hour</b> is short, the more increase the inlet port area ratio F_I 0 /F_I 42 ･ is, the larger the delivery ratio is. (2) When the inlet port area and the engine speed are constant. delivery ratio of the various inlet port opening time goes down linearly with the increase of time ratio t_ 0 /t_ 52 ･ about the inlet port timing. (3) When the inlet port <b>opening</b> area and <b>hour</b> are constant, it is considered that delivery ratio is nearly constant. When the inlet port <b>opening</b> <b>hour</b> is short, delivery ratio is nearly constant and when it is long, delivery ratio becomes smaller and smaller...|$|R

5|$|In the <b>opening</b> <b>hours</b> of the invasion, the Luftwaffe {{destroyed}} the Western Front's air {{force on the}} ground, and {{with the aid of}} Abwehr and their supporting anti-communist fifth columns operating in the Soviet rear paralyzed the Front's communication lines, which particularly cut off the Soviet 4th Army headquarters from headquarters above and below it. On the same day, the 2nd Panzer Group crossed the Bug River, broke through the 4th Army, bypassed Brest Fortress, and pressed on towards Minsk, while the 3rd Panzer Group bypassed most of the 3rd Army and pressed on towards Vilnius. Simultaneously, the German 4th and 9th Armies engaged the Western Front forces in the environs of Białystok. On the order of Dmitry Pavlov, the commander of the Western Front, the 6th and 11th Mechanized Corps and the 6th Cavalry Corps launched a strong counterstrike towards Grodno on 24–25 June in hopes of destroying the 3rd Panzer Group. However, the 3rd Panzer Group had already moved on, with its forward units reaching Vilnius on the evening of 23 June, and the Western Front's armoured counterattack instead ran into infantry and antitank fire from the V Army Corps of the German 9th Army, supported by Luftwaffe air attacks. By the night of 25 June, the Soviet counterattack was defeated, and the commander of the 6th Cavalry Corps was captured. The same night, Pavlov ordered all the remnants of the Western Front to withdraw to Slonim towards Minsk. Subsequent counterattacks to buy time for the withdrawal were launched against the German forces, but all of them failed. On 27 June, the 2nd and 3rd Panzer Groups met near Minsk and captured the city the next day, completing the encirclement of almost all of the Western Front in two pockets: one around Białystok and another west of Minsk. The Germans {{destroyed the}} Soviet 3rd and 10th Armies while inflicting serious losses on the 4th, 11th and 13th Armies, and reported to have captured 324,000 Soviet troops, 3,300 tanks, 1,800 artillery pieces.|$|E
