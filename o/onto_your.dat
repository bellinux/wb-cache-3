500|$|Monthly teen {{magazine}} Seventeen called Purr's bottle design [...] "cute". Miriam Lacey of Popsugar's spin-off website BellaSugar {{gave the}} perfume a favorable review {{and said it}} smelt [...] "like a fancier, less chemical-laden version" [...] of fruit-scented body sprays. In her review, Lacey also called Purr an [...] "upside-down" [...] fragrance, because unlike most perfumes which [...] "open with their prettiest notes and then end with a relatively generic bottom accord", Purr has a [...] "really nice caramel and sweet patchouli dry down that fans of Angel will adore, but to get there, you have to sit through a bunch of fruity opening notes". Lacey observed that its scent only lasted about 2 hours; {{she thought it would}} be better to spray it <b>onto</b> <b>your</b> hairbrush, [...] "since the oils on your scalp will help it last longer".|$|E
500|$|Percussionist Shawn Crahan {{said the}} band {{made an effort}} to pay more {{attention}} to detail than usual during the tour, noting, [...] "when you've got a microphone hanging <b>onto</b> <b>your</b> every note, you tend to give maybe 115 percent instead of 110 percent". The album begins with a staged vocal introduction which was recorded before a concert, informing the audience that the band would not be performing, in an effort to incite anger in the crowd. 9.0: Live includes tracks from the band's first three studio albums, and the banned track [...] "Purity" [...] which was removed from the band's debut album, Slipknot, due to copyright issues. It also contains tracks that are rarely played live, such as [...] "Iowa" [...] and [...] "Get This", as well as the only live performance of [...] "Skin Ticket".|$|E

500|$|Yours Truly is {{the result}} of three years of work. The project {{underwent}} significant conceptual and sonic changes throughout that time. Grande began working on the album in August 2010 while she was filming Victorious and formally started to work on it with a record label after she was signed to Republic Records on August 10, 2011. By September 10 of that year, Grande already had twenty songs prepared and was going through the process of narrowing it down to thirteen. The first single, a bubblegum pop song called [...] "Put Your Hearts Up", was released on December 12, 2011. The single was aimed at young audiences, perhaps intending to cater to Grande's core audience, which at that time was almost entirely made up by kids who knew her from Victorious. During an interview in June 2012, Grande described everything on the album as being [...] "50s, 60s doo-wop-inspired" [...] and revealed that two new singles were going to be released before the album, one of which was called [...] "Do You Love Me?" [...] and featured SkyBlu. Other songs that Grande had rights to, named and later leaked as being part of the album included [...] "Honeymoon Avenue", [...] "Voodoo Love", [...] "Pink Champagne", [...] "Boyfriend Material", [...] "Tattooed Heart", [...] "Daydreamin'" [...] and [...] "You're My Only Shawty". The latter never made it <b>onto</b> <b>Yours</b> Truly and was eventually given to Demi Lovato to record and include on her 2011 R album Unbroken. as [...] "You're My Only Shorty".|$|R
5000|$|Also in 2001 the {{subframe}} {{was changed}} from a steel to a blue painted aluminum style. In 2002 the blue painting was stopped and left to a bare aluminum look. Motorcycle.com says that [...] "The gas tank is reasonably thin and allows good forward and backward movement while providing something nicely shaped to hold <b>onto</b> with <b>your</b> knees. In fact, the entire ergonomic package on this YZF is well thought out. The handlebars have a nice bend to them and are well-placed for good rider control and legroom. The footpegs are well-made units with a wide platform and sit in a position that keeps them from dragging in ruts without cramping a rider's legs." ...|$|R
500|$|Amiga reviewers had {{a common}} grouse: the {{frequent}} disk swaps required were tedious. [...] Regardless, the game's tense atmospheregenerated by {{the combination of}} game mechanics, use of sounds, and artificial intelligenceprovided memorable moments to many reviewers. [...] As one of themSimon Clays of Amiga Computingput it, Space Hulk was [...] "a very difficult strategy-cum-3D dungeon-esque title with plenty of action and gripping play." [...] May said the game offered [...] "demented" [...] violence but was [...] "irresistibly exhiliarating when the action erupts in nonstop, heartpounding carnage." [...] A decade after the game's release, several reviewers mentioned Space Hulk as a Warhammer 40,000 video game worthy of praise. [...] Meer reflected on replaying the game fifteen years after its release, [...] "The panic and terror of facing 90 degrees away from your enemy, and knowing that you can't do a damn thing about it before your lower intestine spills <b>onto</b> <b>your</b> feet, is still something pretty special." ...|$|E
500|$|Cake {{was formed}} in 1991 when John McCrea, a Sacramento, California native who had moved to Los Angeles with a band only to see it [...] "quickly crumble around him", {{returned}} to Sacramento. He began {{looking for a new}} band to play with, having [...] "grown tired of Sacramento's coffeehouse circuit", and quickly attracted trumpet player Vince DiFiore, guitarist Greg Brown, bassist Shon Meckfessel and drummer Frank French. All were active in the music scene at the time; DiFiore notes that [...] " [...] came back and stole us from other bands". The band soon came up with the name [...] "Cake"; rather than referring to the foodstuff, the name is meant to be [...] "like when something insidiously becomes a part of your life... mean it more as something that cakes <b>onto</b> <b>your</b> shoe and is just sort of there until you get rid of it". McFessel soon left to attend college, and was replaced by Gabe Nelson. After touring and becoming part of the club scene in San Francisco, the band independently recorded and released Motorcade of Generosity in 1994, selling copies from their van as a method of paying touring expenses.|$|E
500|$|Lester {{was offered}} {{producing}} credit but refused, going uncredited for his work. Salkind felt that bringing a second director onto the set meant {{there would be}} someone ready {{in the event that}} Donner could not fulfill his directing duties. [...] "Being there all the time meant he [...] could take over," [...] Salkind admitted. [...] " [...] couldn't make up his mind on stuff." [...] On Lester, Donner reflected, [...] "He'd been suing the Salkinds for his money on Three and Four Musketeers, which he'd never gotten. He won a lot of his lawsuits, but each time he sued the Salkinds in one country, they'd move to another, from Costa Rica to Panama to Switzerland. When I was hired, Lester told me, 'Don't do it. Don't work for them. I was told not to, but I did it. Now I'm telling you not to, but you'll probably do it and end up telling the next guy.' Lester came in as a 'go-between'. I didn't trust Lester, and I told him. He said, 'Believe me, I'm only doing it because they're paying me the money that they owe me from the lawsuit. I'll never come <b>onto</b> <b>your</b> set unless you ask me; I'll never go to your dailies. If I can help you in any way, call me." ...|$|E

40|$|Wireless {{networking}} {{has become}} very popular in recent years due {{to the increase in}} adoption of mobile devices. As more and more employees demand for Wi-Fi access for their devices, more companies have been jumping <b>onto</b> the "Bring <b>Your</b> Own Device" (BYOD) bandwagon[1] to appease their employees. One such example of an enterprise wireless infrastructure is the George Washington University's GWireless. For this project, I will attempt to capture hashes of authentication credentials from users who are connecting to the GWireless network using what is commonly known as the "evil twin" attack. I will document the hardware, software used and steps taken to configure the devices. I will then evaluate the feasibility of such an attack, explore variations of the attack and document measures that can be taken to prevent such an attack...|$|R

5000|$|The Skannerz Racerz is {{the third}} in the Skannerz series, where you can scan barcodes, and race cars from three classes: [...] "Off-Road", [...] "Drag", and [...] "Street".There are 120 cars in total, which {{consists}} of 40 cars per class. The game also has 64 optional parts you can install <b>onto</b> any of <b>your</b> vehicles to upgrade them. You start {{the game with a}} basic vehicle known as the [...] "Gizmo" [...] and you must win a certain amount of races to progress in rank, from Rookie to Amateur to Pro. Cars and parts can be obtained by scanning barcodes and either receiving a car from the dealership or beating your opponent in a Pink Slip style race. Parts are also obtained the same as dealership cars, but are received from the Garage. Only one of each car and car part can be obtained. Hindrances can pop up anytime you scan a barcode in the form of losing your car to the police, being impounded or a modified car crashing into a tree and losing a part. Races involve beating the other opponent and also involve 5 Speed Gear changes. Each track has its own obstacles: Off-road has bumps you have to avoid, drag involves your car swaying from side to side along the track and street involves your car slowing and sliding around turns.|$|R

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the first two, Season 3 of the series was met with mostly negative reception. After the eventual cancellation of the show, Schwartz admitted that [...] "the whole {{first half of the}} third season was a total mess." [...] IGN faulted a season which, in their opinion, had [...] "far too much time and too many episodes spent with the less than beloved character Johnny." [...] IGN also noted that [...] "Kirsten and Sandy both suffered from unsatisfying stories," [...] and that the departure of character Caleb Nichol had been a mistake [...] "as he had been a great character to bounce off both of the elder Cohens." [...] In September 2007, Schwartz admitted in an interview for New York that the show [...] "went down the wrong road" [...] with Johnny. The season did, however, receive some praise. The new character Taylor Townsend was stated as being [...] "played to perfection by Autumn Reeser" [...] and her character was described as [...] "one of the greatest elements of The O.C." [...] Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk described the storylines as [...] "very intelligent and also incorporate a great deal of humor to keep your interest." [...] While looking back on the series in an interview for the complete series box-set, Schwartz explained that [...] "somewhere around Season 3, for reasons too numerous to discuss, I lost focus. The network wasn't really supporting the show." [...] Schwartz {{went on to say that}} Season 3 was probably [...] "the most important season, because it's where I learned the most. About television, about myself as a writer, about discipline and trying to hold <b>onto</b> <b>your</b> focus even if you're hearing a lot of opinions or being forced to add things creatively that you don't agree with. And I don't think Season 4 would have been as fun or as adventurous or as weird and zany and ultimately emotional if it weren't for that experience." ...|$|E

50|$|This {{track is}} {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most unforgiving R/C tracks in the world with a very fast and narrow driving line. The track's nickname, 'The Fort', has been earned over many years of battle with drivers. The 30-year-old galvanized steel 'boards' make a loud bang exaggerating every hit, but yielding little. In the late 90s, plastic guards were added to many of the most destructive corners in an effort to tame the track. If a car is on line through the large sweeper <b>onto</b> the straight <b>your</b> car will disappear briefly because of the concrete curbs that create the island. The chicane in front of the driver stand, 'aka Dead Mans Curve', is one of the toughest spots on the track as drivers try to negotiate this tight area without lifting. The dots (plow disks) on the carousel were recently tamed in 2005, when they were covered by a plastic loop. The start-finish lap timing loop is located just before the pits, requiring drivers to make almost a whole lap before starting their qualifying run. This makes the 5-minute qualifiers a battle between power and fuel mileage. Some drivers will make a pit stop during qualifying. Before the 2005 event new asphalt was laid, due to damage by Hurricane Charley, and for the first time Mike Swauger and Michael Salven were able to complete 26 laps during qualifying. In 2008, live scoring over the internet was added, to allow people from around the world to view the races in real time. In 2009, live video coverage and audio of the race announcers was added to the site without a fee. Thanks to good weather and lots of traction compound testing during the summer, DJ Apolaro was able to set the first 24 lap qualifier in a sedan and Mike Swauger turned the first 27 lap qualifier with a 1/8 scale car. Paolo Morganti would set a new track record for the sedan at 24 laps in 5:11.71 and Mike Swauger 27 laps in 5:10.97 with a 1/8 scale car.|$|R

60|$|I {{was to have}} {{an early}} breakfast, and start at dawn, for that was the usual way; but I had the demon's own time with my armor, and this delayed me a little. It is {{troublesome}} to get into, and {{there is so much}} detail. First you wrap a layer or two of blanket around your body, for a sort of cushion and to keep off the cold iron; then you put on your sleeves and shirt of chain mail--these are made of small steel links woven together, and they form a fabric so flexible that if you toss your shirt onto the floor, it slumps into a pile like a peck of wet fish-net; it is very heavy and is nearly the uncomfortablest material in the world for a night shirt, yet plenty used it for that--tax collectors, and reformers, and one-horse kings with a defective title, and those sorts of people; then you put on your shoes--flat-boats roofed over with interleaving bands of steel--and screw your clumsy spurs into the heels. Next you buckle your greaves on your legs, and your cuisses on your thighs; then come your backplate and your breastplate, and you begin to feel crowded; then you hitch onto the breastplate the half-petticoat of broad overlapping bands of steel which hangs down in front but is scolloped out behind so you can sit down, and isn't any real improvement on an inverted coal scuttle, either for looks or for wear, or to wipe your hands on; next you belt on your sword; then you put your stove-pipe joints <b>onto</b> <b>your</b> arms, your iron gauntlets <b>onto</b> <b>your</b> hands, your iron rat-trap <b>onto</b> <b>your</b> head, with a rag of steel web hitched onto it to hang over the back of your neck--and there you are, snug as a candle in a candle-mould. This is no time to dance. Well, a man that is packed away like that is a nut that isn't worth the cracking, there is so little of the meat, when you get down to it, by comparison with the shell.|$|E

"I don't {{know what}} I had {{expected}} to see, but I was never more surprised than when, getting there, I {{found that it was}} a trunk, and that in it, sitting up, was a child about eighteen months old. That was you, Harry. In the bottom of the trunk were a locket with a woman's likeness in it, a curious Indian bangle, and a few other articles of jewelry. How you got there we never knew, but the supposition was that when the pirate was overhauling the merchantman, and her true nature was ascertained, some mother, knowing the fate that awaited all on board, had put you in an open trunk, had thrown in what ornaments she had about her, and had dropped the trunk overboard, in hopes that it might drift away and be picked up by some passing ship. It was a wild venture, with a thousand to one against its success, but the Lord had watched over it, and there you were as snug and comfortable as if you had been laying in your own cot, though, by the way, you were squalling as loud as a litter of kittens, and I expect had missed your breakfast considerably.
