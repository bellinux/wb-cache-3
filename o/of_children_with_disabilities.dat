5|$|Nicholas Edmund Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 12th Earl of Shaftesbury (born 3 June 1979), {{a former}} DJ and house music {{promoter}} in New York and Privilege in Ibiza, Spain. A short time following his brother's death, Nicholas relocated {{to the family}} seat at Wimborne St Giles, returned to business school {{for a couple of}} years, and assumed the responsibilities of the earldom. He has shown an interest in supporting charitable organisations, primarily those addressing the needs <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities.</b> In December 2009, Nicholas suffered serious spinal injuries in a horse riding accident. He crushed his vertebrae in the fall. While he experienced initial paralysis necessitating the use of a wheelchair, physical therapy has helped restore his health {{to the point where he}} is able to walk, with limitations. With continued rehabilitation, doctors expect a full recovery.|$|E
25|$|Gender {{disparity}} is also {{visible in}} the education <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities,</b> {{a study in the}} 1990s revealed that only 37% of disabled females are literate compared to 57% for males. A reason for this situation is the cultural notion that the male will carry the family name while the female will marry. Also the option of street begging by young disabled girls in order to earn income can inhibit their attendance of classes.|$|E

25|$|Oftentimes, schools simply {{lack the}} {{resources}} to create an optimal classroom setting for those in need of special education. In the United States, it can cost between $6595 to $10,421 extra to educate a child with autism. In the 2011-2012 school year, {{the average cost of}} education for a public school student was $12,401. In some cases, the extra cost required to educate a child with autism nearly doubles the average cost to educate the average public school student. As the range of those with autism can widely vary, {{it is very difficult to}} create an autism program that is well suited to the entire population of autistics as well as those with other disabilities. In the United States, many school districts are requiring schools to meet the needs of disabled students, regardless of the number <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> there are in the school. This combined with a shortage of licensed special education teachers has created a deficiency in the special education system. The shortage has caused some states to give temporary special education licenses to teachers with the caveat that they receive a license within a few years.|$|E
25|$|The unusual {{lifestyle}} and growth pattern of Kiryas Joel {{has led to}} litigation {{on a number of}} fronts. In 1994, the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet that the Kiryas Joel school district, which covered only the village, was designed in violation of the Establishment Clause of the 1st Amendment, because the design accommodated one group on the basis of religious affiliation. Subsequently, the New York State Legislature established a similar school district in the village that has passed legal muster. Further litigation has resulted over what entity should pay for the education <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> in Kiryas Joel, and over whether the community's boys must ride buses driven by women. A case against the village is currently pending in federal district court; plaintiffs, who are asking for the village to be dissolved, say that Kiryas Joel is a theocracy whose existence violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, where local government leaders abuse the laws, such as those for tax-exempt status, zoning, and sanitation, to favor members of their own sect and persecute other Orthodox Jews. They also say that the leaders commit vote fraud by intimidating dissident voters and busing in non-residents.|$|E
25|$|Aiken {{has been}} a {{dedicated}} advocate for education and for children's causes. His interest in autism issues led him, along with Diane Bubel (whose son Michael is diagnosed with autism and was tutored by Aiken), to found the National Inclusion Project (formerly the Bubel/Aiken Foundation), which supports the integration <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> into the life environment of their non-disabled peers. The Foundation runs summer camps which reflect its mission, and also presents Able to Serve awards to support the volunteer efforts of children with physical and mental disabilities. In July 2005, Raleigh's WRAL-TV reported on an internet campaign mounted by critics questioning how Aiken's foundation used its money. WRAL news hired an independent accountant who reported that program services totaled $920,000 in 2004—around 85 cents on every dollar donated—which is considered a solid percentage compared to other charities. CNN picked up the story, and Aiken appeared on Showbiz Tonight to provide details about the Foundation's programs. In late 2004, the Foundation was awarded a $500,000 grant by the US government to develop a K–12 model for inclusion in community service projects {{to be used in}} schools across the country. In addition, State Farm granted $1.5million to the Foundation to help develop a primary education curriculum focused on teaching social and life skills through service to children of all levels of ability.|$|E
40|$|Objective This study {{examined}} predictors of excess psychological morbidity in parents <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> intellectual <b>disabilities.</b> Methods Thirty-two parents <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> intellectual <b>disabilities</b> and 29 parents <b>of</b> typically developing <b>children</b> completed the Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale, and measures <b>of</b> social support, <b>child</b> problem behaviors, sleep quality, and perceived caregiver burden. Results Parents <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> intellectual <b>disabilities</b> registered high {{depression and anxiety}} scores, and the majority met the criteria for possible clinical depression and/or anxiety. The strongest predictor of psychological morbidity was caregiver burden. Analyses of its component dimensions indicated that feelings of guilt held the greatest consequence for depression and anxiety. Conclusions Caregiver burden, in general, and its guilt component, in particular, predicted symptoms of depression and anxiety in parents <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> intellectual <b>disabilities.</b> Assisting such parents to resolve their feelings of guilt should benefit their psychological status.

40|$|While {{there is}} {{increasing}} international interest in disability inclusive development, people <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> largely remain ‘unseen, unheard and uncounted’ (UN ESCAP 2012 : 1). <b>Children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability,</b> particularly, remain excluded from research informing development, {{and there is a}} paucity of information that is drawn directly from the self-report <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> living in developing countries. This exclusion occurs across all stages of research, including access to research findings. When child research is conducted in such countries, to gain further evidence to support disability inclusive development and advance human rights, researchers must question how findings will be reported back to participants and their communities, and seek a method that is both accessible and culturally relevant. This paper reports on the Voices <b>of</b> Pacific <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> research project about the human rights <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> in Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea (PNG), and focuses on film as a dissemination method.

Mothers <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> intellectual <b>disability</b> reported similar levels of parental warmth, and less use of reasoning and autonomy support compared with mothers <b>of</b> typically developing <b>children.</b> Parenting efficacy contributed uniquely to three dimensions of authoritative parenting for mothers <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> intellectual <b>disability.</b> By comparison, parenting efficacy did not contribute to use of reasoning and autonomy support for mothers <b>of</b> typically developing <b>children.</b> Social support made a unique but small contribution to parental warmth but not to parental reasoning and autonomy support for mothers <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> intellectual <b>disability.</b> For mothers <b>of</b> typically developing <b>children,</b> social support was associated with both parental warmth and autonomy support.

40|$|Informal caregiving denotes {{care that}} is {{provided}} by {{a family member or}} friend rather than by a professional who is reimbursed for services. Assuming a caregiving role can be stressful and burdensome. The effects of caregiving on the caregiver's health are moderated by individual differences in resources and vulnerabilities, such as socioeconomic status, prior health status, and level of social support. This work describes the determinant of psycho-social well-being of informal caregivers <b>of</b> physically challenged <b>children</b> in southwest <b>of</b> Nigeria. This study is guided theoretically by Ryff”s psychosocial well-being theory, The study adopted expo facto research design. Multistage samplings involving the use of random and purposive techniques were used to select 812 respondents who are informal caregivers. Social support questionnaire, Social support satisfaction level, Ryff’s psychological well-being scale were used. Findings indicated that social support predicted psycho-social well-being of informal caregivers <b>of</b> physically challenged <b>children.</b> Social support and satisfaction level combine together have impact on psycho-social well-being of informal caregivers <b>of</b> physically challenged <b>children.</b> More also, socio-economic factors such as occupation, educational level and income also predict psycho-social well-being of informal caregivers. Finally, marital status and gender also contribute to well-being of caregivers. It was therefore, recommended that social inclusion should be pursued <b>with</b> de-institutionalization <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> Parents <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> should be encouraged to form support group and as well as encouraging fathers <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> to take an active part in ensuring their <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> well-being.
