5|$|Hemingway's {{marriage}} to Hadley deteriorated {{as he was}} working <b>on</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> Also Rises. In early 1926, Hadley became aware of his affair with Pfeiffer, who came to Pamplona with them that July. On their return to Paris, Hadley asked for a separation; in November she formally requested a divorce. They split their possessions while Hadley accepted Hemingway's offer of the proceeds from The Sun Also Rises. The couple were divorced in January 1927, and Hemingway married Pfeiffer in May.|$|E

5|$|Launched in 1991, Japan's Yohkoh (Sunbeam) {{satellite}} observed solar flares at X-ray wavelengths. Mission data allowed {{scientists to}} identify several {{different types of}} flares, and demonstrated that the corona away from regions of peak activity was much more dynamic and active than had previously been supposed. Yohkoh observed an entire solar cycle but went into standby mode when an annular eclipse in 2001 caused it to lose its lock <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> It was destroyed by atmospheric re-entry in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Sleeping Dogs {{is set in}} a {{contemporary}} Hong Kong, which is split into four districts named after regions of the city. The game reveals the story of Wei Shen (Will Yun Lee), a former San Francisco police officer who was transferred to the Hong Kong Police Force and assigned the task to infiltrate and destroy a Triad organization known as the Sun On Yee (based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> Yee On). The main storyline features two sub-plots: Shen's balance between completing his police mission whilst committing crimes to prove himself to the Triads, and missions assigned by a Triad lieutenant, including assassination of Triad members loyal to other lieutenants.|$|E
5|$|The Persian polymath Avicenna {{claimed to}} have {{observed}} Venus as a spot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> This is possible, as there was a transit on May 24, 1032, but Avicenna did not give the date of his observation, and modern scholars have questioned whether he could have observed the transit from his location at that time; he may have mistaken a sunspot for Venus. He used his transit observation to help establish that Venus was, at least sometimes, below the Sun in Ptolemaic cosmology, i.e. the sphere of Venus comes before the sphere of the Sun when moving out from the Earth in the prevailing geocentric model.|$|E

5|$|Dead reckoning, {{navigating}} from a known position {{using only}} information about one's own speed and direction, was suggested by Charles Darwin in 1873 {{as a possible}} mechanism. In the 20th century, Karl von Frisch showed that honey bees can navigate by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth's magnetic field; of these, they rely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> when possible. William Tinsley Keeton showed that homing pigeons could similarly make use {{of a range of}} navigational cues, including the sun, earth's magnetic field, olfaction and vision. Ronald Lockley demonstrated that a species of small seabird, the Manx shearwater, could orient themselves and fly home at full speed, when released far from home, provided either the sun or the stars were visible.|$|E
5|$|The first story-driven game expansion, Nightmare in North Point, was {{released}} in October 2012. Its theme is based on Chinese horror and folklore, and features Chinese vampires known as the jiangshi. In the expansion's plot, Shen's girlfriend is abducted by the ghost of Smiley Cat, a former gangster killed by Uncle Po, who has risen up from the underworld as a ghost to take his vengeance <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> On Yee. Shen fights Smiley Cat's army of jiangshi, Yaoguai and possessed gangsters, {{as well as the}} ghosts of Dogeyes, Johnny Ratface and Ponytail, who reveals that Wei can defeat Smiley Cat by burning the last remnant of his original body. After incinerating his little finger, Cat returns to the underworld and Shen's girlfriend is freed.|$|E
5|$|The second movie Cagney's company {{produced}} was Blood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> Insisting {{on doing}} his own stunts, Cagney required judo training from expert Ken Kuniyuki and Jack Halloran, a former policeman. The Cagneys {{had hoped that}} an action film would appeal more to audiences, but it fared worse {{at the box office}} than Johnny Come Lately. At this time, Cagney heard of young war hero Audie Murphy, who had appeared on the cover of Life magazine. Cagney thought that Murphy had the looks to be a movie star, and suggested that he come to Hollywood. Cagney felt, however, that Murphy could not act, and his contract was loaned out and then sold.|$|E

5|$|Wolf 359 {{is one of}} {{the faintest}} and lowest-mass stars known. At the {{light-emitting}} layer called the photosphere, it has a temperature of about 2,800 K, which is low enough for chemical compounds to form and survive. The absorption lines of compounds such as water and titanium(II) oxide have been observed in the spectrum. The surface has a magnetic field that is stronger than the average magnetic field <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> As a result of magnetic activity caused by convection, Wolf 359 is a flare star that can undergo sudden increases in luminosity for several minutes. These flares emit strong bursts of X-ray and gamma ray radiation that have been observed by space telescopes. Wolf 359 is a relatively young star with an age of less than a billion years. No companions or disks of debris have been detected in orbit around it.|$|E
5|$|Although accurate, shadow clocks relied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun,</b> {{and so were}} useless {{at night}} and in cloudy weather. The Egyptians {{therefore}} developed a number of alternative timekeeping instruments, including water clocks, and a system for tracking star movements. The oldest description of a water clock is from the tomb inscription of the 16th-century Egyptian court official Amenemhet, identifying him as its inventor. There were several types of water clocks, some more elaborate than others. One type consisted of a bowl with small holes in its bottom, which was floated on water and allowed to fill at a near-constant rate; markings {{on the side of}} the bowl indicated elapsed time, as the surface of the water reached them. The oldest-known waterclock was found in the tomb of pharaoh Amenhotep I (1525–1504), suggesting that they were first used in ancient Egypt. Another Egyptian method of determining the time during the night was using plumb-lines called merkhets. In use since at least 600, two of these instruments were aligned with Polaris, the north pole star, to create a north–south meridian. The time was accurately measured by observing certain stars as they crossed the line created with the merkhets.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} studies give two thermoregulatory roles for the sail of Dimetrodon: one {{as a means of}} warming quickly in the morning, and another as a way to cool down when body {{temperature}} becomes high. Dimetrodon and all other Early Permian land vertebrates are assumed to have been cold-blooded or poikilothermic, relying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> to maintain a high body temperature. Because of its large size, Dimetrodon had high thermal inertia, meaning that changes in body temperature occurred more slowly in it than in smaller-bodied animals. As temperatures rose in the mornings, the small-bodied prey of Dimetrodon could warm their bodies much faster than could something the size of Dimetrodon. Many paleontologists including Haack have proposed that the sail of Dimetrodon may have allowed it to warm quickly in the morning in order to keep pace with its prey. The sail's large surface area also meant heat could dissipate quickly into the surroundings, useful if the animal needed to release excess heat produced by metabolism or absorbed from the sun. Dimetrodon may have angled its sail away from the sun to cool off or restricted blood flow to the sail to maintain heat at night.|$|E

Shakira's official website first announced the three initial venues of the North American leg of the tour, on 3 May 2010, and subsequently 22 more venues were listed. After a special tour preview show held in Montreal, Canada, on 2 August 2010, the North American leg of the tour commenced at Uncasville, Connecticut, on 17 September, and closed at Rosemont, Illinois, on 29 October 2010. The initial dates for the European leg of the tour were announced on 28 June 2010, and subsequently 22 more shows were listed. The European leg of the tour was planned to commence at Lyon, France, on 16 November, and end in London, England, on 20 December 2010. The tickets for the initial dates of the European leg were soon sold out, and Shakira extended the tour into 2011, beginning by announcing a show at Paris, France; venues at countries such as Croatia, Russia, Spain and Switzerland were soon added. The Latin American leg of the tour {{was a part of}} the Pop Festival, which was heralded as an initiative to bring international music stars to Latin America. Initial tour dates for the leg were announced on 3 December 2010, and soon venues at countries like Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico were added to the tour dates.|$|E
