However, Lamna teeth that closely {{resemble those of}} the porbeagle {{have been found in}} the La Meseta Formation on Seymour Island off the Antarctic Peninsula, which date to the middle to late Eocene epoch (50–34 Ma). There is much taxonomic confusion regarding Lamna in the fossil record due to the high degree <b>of</b> <b>variability</b> in adult tooth morphology within species.|$|E

Loss-of-function mutations in SLC2A9 and SLC22A12 cause hereditary hypouricaemia by reducing urate absorption and unopposed urate secretion. The rare genetic disorders familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy, medullary cystic kidney disease, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency as seen in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, are complicated by gout.|$|E

5|$|The current taxonomic {{arrangement}} of the Banksia genus is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B.marginata is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, because its inflorescences {{take the form of}} Banksias characteristic flower spikes, section Banksia because of its straight styles, and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. In a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994, Kevin Thiele placed it as the most basal member of a newly described subseries Integrifoliae, within the series Salicinae. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George. George did concede that major work is needed on Banksia marginata, which shows such a high degree <b>of</b> <b>variability</b> over its range.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the houses}} at Gedi vary in size, their number of rooms, and their layout, the basic {{house at the}} site is a three-room structure, which usually {{contained}} a forecourt and domestic court. With the three-room layout, there was usually a long main room with two storage and sleeping quarters towards {{the back of the}} house. One of the back rooms usually had a storage compartment near the roof with access through a trapdoor. Latrines, usually located {{toward the back of the}} main room, were also present in many of the houses, while wells were present in the courtyards of some of the houses. One of the oldest stone houses dates to the fourteenth century and has a long narrow sunken court, which contrasts the wider and deeper courts found in houses constructed during the fifteenth century. The entrances of houses have a greater deal <b>of</b> <b>variability</b> in the configuration of their passageways, since many of the houses were highly concentrated and laid out to maximize the use of available space.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of Sumatran rhino populations has identified three distinct genetic lineages. The channel between Sumatra and Malaysia {{was not as}} significant a barrier for the rhinos as the Barisan Mountains {{along the length of}} Sumatra, for rhinos in eastern Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia are more closely related than the rhinos {{on the other side of}} the mountains in western Sumatra. In fact, the eastern Sumatra and Malaysia rhinos show so little genetic variance, the populations were likely not separate during the Pleistocene, when sea levels were much lower and Sumatra formed part of the mainland. Both populations of Sumatra and Malaysia, however, are close enough genetically that interbreeding would not be problematic. The rhinos of Borneo are sufficiently distinct that conservation geneticists have advised against crossing their lineages with the other populations. Conservation geneticists have recently begun to study the diversity of the gene pool within these populations by identifying microsatellite loci. The results of initial testing found levels <b>of</b> <b>variability</b> within Sumatran rhino populations comparable to those in the population of the less endangered African rhinos, but the genetic diversity of Sumatran rhinos is an area of continuing study.|$|E

40|$|With the {{emergence}} of aspect-oriented (AO) techniques, crosscutting concerns can be now explicitly modularized and exposed as additional variabilities in program families. Hence, the development of highly customizable software family architectures requires the explicit handling <b>of</b> crosscutting <b>variabilities</b> through domain engineering and application engineering steps. In this context, this paper presents a generative model that addresses the implementation and instantiation <b>of</b> <b>variabilities</b> encountered in AO software family architectures. The use of our model allows for an early specification and preparation <b>of</b> AO <b>variabilities,</b> which in turn can be explicitly customized by means of domain engineering activities. All the <b>variabilities</b> <b>of</b> the architecture are modeled using feature models. In application engineering, developers can request an instance of the AO architecture {{in a process of}} two stages: (i) the definition of a feature model instance which specifies the resolution <b>of</b> <b>variabilities</b> for the AO family architecture; and (ii) the definition of a set of crosscutting relationships between features. 1...|$|R
5|$|The {{chromosomal}} region that encodes an antibody {{is large and}} contains several distinct gene loci for each domain of the antibody—the chromosome region containing heavy chain genes (IGH@) is found on chromosome 14, and the loci containing lambda and kappa light chain genes (IGL@ and IGK@) are found on chromosomes 22 and 2 in humans. One of these domains is called the variable domain, which is present in each heavy and light chain of every antibody, but can differ in different antibodies generated from distinct B cells. Differences, between the variable domains, are located on three loops known as hypervariable regions (HV-1, HV-2 and HV-3) or complementarity determining regions (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3). CDRs are supported within the variable domains by conserved framework regions. The heavy chain locus contains about 65 different variable domain genes that all differ in their CDRs. Combining these genes {{with an array of}} genes for other domains of the antibody generates a large cavalry of antibodies with a high degree <b>of</b> <b>variability.</b> This combination is called V(D)J recombination discussed below.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of an analogous RMS in humans {{has been difficult to}} identify, possibly because the olfactory bulb is significantly less developed in humans than in rodents and thus harder to study, and much of the previous scientific work has been called into question concerning the RMS in humans. In the developing fetal brain and in young postnatal infants, chains of immature neurons typical of the RMS were observed. However, there was little evidence for the existence of a migrating chain along the SVZ or olfactory peduncle to the bulb in the adult human brain, even though there was a distinct population of adult neuronal stem cells in the SVZ. These researchers studied subjects from 0 to 84 years of age by analyzing brain sections that had been removed during surgery or during autopsies. They discovered that cells that expressed DCX (doublecortin) and PSA-NCAM are present in the brain sections taken from infants, but have disappeared by 18 months. Yet further studies indicated the {{presence of}} a small population of migrating immature neurons, which originate solely from the SVZ. These neuroblasts appear singly or in pairs without forming chains, in contrast to the elongated chains of neuroblasts observed in the rodent RMS. This suggests that the RMS is drastically reduced beyond infancy and especially into adulthood, but is not absent. However, a direct correlation between stem cell quiescence and age has not yet been defined due to a high level <b>of</b> <b>variability</b> between individuals. Thus an RMS analogous structure in the adult human brain remains highly controversial.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a new method of likelihood ratio computation for score-based biometric recognition systems given {{a small number}} of samples in the within-source variability dataset (also called target set). Generally the number of samples in the within-source variability dataset is less than the number of samples in the between-source variability dataset (also called non-target set) and therefore the probability density function (pdf) <b>of</b> the within-source <b>variability</b> dataset cannot be estimated reliably compared to the pdf <b>of</b> the between-source <b>variability.</b> The proposed method estimates the pdf <b>of</b> within-source <b>variability</b> from estimates <b>of</b> the within-source <b>variability</b> mean and variance and the pdf <b>of</b> between-source <b>variability</b> by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler distance [1] of the pdf <b>of</b> the within-source <b>variability</b> to that <b>of</b> the between-source <b>variability</b> given within-source variability mean and variance.

25|$|Spontaneous {{fluctuations}} in global climate might explain past variability. It {{is very difficult}} to know what the true level <b>of</b> <b>variability</b> from only internal causes might be since other forcings, as noted above, exist whose magnitude may not be known either. One approach to evaluating internal variability is to use long integrations of coupled ocean-atmosphere global climate models. They have the advantage that the external forcing is known to be zero, but the disadvantage is that they may not fully reflect reality. The variations may result from chaos-driven changes in the oceans, the atmosphere, or interactions between the two. Two studies have concluded that the demonstrated inherent variability is not great enough to account for the Little Ice Age.|$|E
