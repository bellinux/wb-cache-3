The first discovery of gold, at Rancho San Francisco {{in the mountains}} north of present-day Los Angeles, had been in 1842, six years before Marshall's discovery, while California was still part of Mexico. However, these first deposits, and later discoveries in Southern California mountains, attracted little notice and were of limited consequence economically.|$|E

Trekbokken is still observed occasionally in Botswana, though <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> smaller scale than earlier.|$|E
5|$|Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen, {{also built}} by Christian IV, {{is another example}} of the Dutch Renaissance style. In 1606, the king first had a two-storey summerhouse built on a site he used as a park for relaxation. He then decided to start work <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> more ambitious building, the castle, which {{developed}} in stages until a Dutch Renaissance masterpiece was completed in 1624. Predating the castle, the Renaissance-style park, is Denmark's oldest royal garden.|$|E
5|$|Some of this retreat has {{resulted}} in efforts {{to slow down the}} loss of glaciers in the Alps. To retard melting of the glaciers used by certain Austrian ski resorts, portions of the Stubai and Pitztal Glaciers were partially covered with plastic. In Switzerland plastic sheeting is also used to reduce the melt of glacial ice used as ski slopes. While covering glaciers with plastic sheeting may prove advantageous to ski resorts on a small scale, this practice is not expected to be economically practical <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> larger scale.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} GE invention by Tracy Hall {{uses the}} belt press wherein {{the upper and}} lower anvils supply the pressure load to a cylindrical inner cell. This internal pressure is confined radially by a belt of pre-stressed steel bands. The anvils also serve as electrodes providing electric current to the compressed cell. A variation of the belt press uses hydraulic pressure, rather than steel belts, to confine the internal pressure. Belt presses are still used today, but they are built <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> larger scale than those of the original design.|$|E

5|$|A {{reversible}} {{cellular automaton}} is a cellular automaton {{in which every}} configuration has a unique predecessor. That is, it is a regular grid of cells, each containing a state drawn from a finite set of states, with a rule for updating all cells simultaneously based on the states of their neighbors, such that the previous state of any cell before an update can be determined uniquely from the updated states of all the cells. The time-reversed dynamics of a reversible cellular automaton can always be described by another cellular automaton rule, possibly <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> larger neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|After the Nika Revolt {{destroyed}} much of {{the city}} of Constantinople in 532, including the churches of Hagia Sophia ("Holy Wisdom") and Hagia Irene ("Holy Peace"), Justinian had the opportunity to rebuild. Both had been basilica plan churches and both were rebuilt as domed basilicas, although the Hagia Sophia was rebuilt <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> grander scale. Built by Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus in Constantinople between 532 and 537, the Hagia Sophia has been called the greatest building in the world. It is an original and innovative design with no known precedents in the way it covers a basilica plan with dome and semi-domes. Periodic earthquakes in the region have caused three partial collapses of the dome and necessitated repairs. The precise shape of the original central dome completed in 537 was significantly different from the current one and, according to contemporary accounts, much bolder.|$|E
5|$|An {{adaptation}} of the comics was originally envisioned by producer Tonino Cervi. Cervi hired director Seth Holt and began producing the film as an international co-production, with a cast that included Jean Sorel, Elsa Martinelli and Gilbert Roland. After producer Dino De Laurentiis saw the footage that had been shot, he halted production on the film, had a new screenplay developed, and hired a new director and cast. This resulted in Bava directing the film <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> lower budget, with more well-known actors taking smaller roles. Many of {{the cast and crew}} members were brought in from Barbarella, De Laurentiis' other comic book {{adaptation of}} that year.|$|E
5|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{influential}} factor shaping this new class was the competitive nature of scholarly candidates entering civil service through the imperial examinations. Although not all scholar-officials came from the landholding class, sons of prominent landholders had better access to higher education, and thus greater ability to pass examinations for government service. Gaining a scholarly degree by passing prefectural, circuit-level, or palace exams in the Song period {{was the most important}} prerequisite in being considered for appointment, especially to higher posts; this was a departure from the Tang period, when the examination system was enacted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> smaller scale. A higher degree attained through the three levels of examinations meant a greater chance of obtaining higher offices in government. Not only did this ensure a higher salary, but also greater social prestige, visibly distinguished by dress. This institutionalized distinction of scholar-officials by dress included the type and even color of traditional silken robes, hats, and girdles, demarcating that scholar-official's level of administrative authority. This rigid code of dress was especially enforced during the beginning of the dynasty, although the prestigious clothing color of purple slowly began to diffuse through the ranks of middle and low grade officials.|$|E

5|$|As {{a gateway}} to the west, and Persia in particular, Lahore had a strong {{regional}} style which was heavily influenced by Persian architectural styles. Earlier mosques, such as the Wazir Khan Mosque, were adorned in intricate kashi kari, or Kashan style tile work, from which the Badshahi Mosque would depart. Aurangzeb chose an architectural plan {{similar to that of}} Shah Jehan's choice for the Jama Masjid in Delhi, though built the Badshahi mosque <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> larger scale. Both mosques feature red sandstone with white marble inlay, which is a departure from typical mosque design in Lahore, in which decoration is done by means of intricate tile work.|$|E
5|$|Civil service examinations: In the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD), the xiaolian {{system of}} {{recruiting}} government officials through formal recommendations {{was the chief}} method of filling bureaucratic posts, although there was an Imperial Academy to train potential candidates for office and some offices required its candidates to pass formal written tests before appointment. However, {{it was not until}} the Sui Dynasty (581–618) that civil service examinations became open to all adult males not belonging to the merchant class (although having wealth or noble status were not requirements) and were used as a universal prerequisite for appointments to office, at least in theory. The civil service system was implemented <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> larger scale during the Song Dynasty (960–1279), when an elite core of dynastic-founding and professional families lost their majority in government to a broad strata of lesser gentry families from throughout the country.|$|E
5|$|Danebury was {{abandoned}} around 100BC, {{in common with}} the trend across Britain for hill forts to fall out of use around that time.

The site continued in use, but <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> smaller scale than before. Buildings were left to decay and the interior of the fort became used for grazing. By the start of the 1st centuryAD, the settlement of Danebury was probably nothing more than a single farm.|$|E

5|$|From the mid-20th century, {{the docks}} {{declined}} in use and were finally closed in 1980, {{leading to the}} setting up of the London Docklands Development Corporation in 1981. London's main port is now at Tilbury, further down the Thames estuary, outside the boundary of Greater London. The dock had been established in 1886 to bring bulk goods by rail to London, but being nearer the sea and able to accommodate vessels of 50,000tons, they were more easily converted {{to the needs of}} modern container ships in 1968, and so they survived the closure of the inner docks.

5|$|On March 9, 1842, Francisco Lopez, {{the uncle}} of Antonio's second wife, Jacoba Feliz, took a rest under {{an oak tree}} in Placerita Canyon and had a dream that he was {{floating}} on a pool of gold. When he awoke, he pulled a few wild onions from the ground finding flakes of gold in the roots. Contrary to some portraits {{of him as a}} farmer who stumbled upon his discovery by dumb luck, Lopez had studied mineralogy at the University of Mexico and had been actively searching for gold. Evidence suggests that gold had previously been found in the area about thirty years prior, but the Lopez gold find was the first popularly documented incident in the area. This sparked a gold rush <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> smaller scale than the 1849 California Gold Rush. About 2,000 people, mostly from the Mexican state of Sonora, came to Rancho San Francisco to mine the gold.|$|E
