2500|$|Kevin Lonergan at Information Age, a business-technology magazine, has {{referred}} to the terms surrounding IoT as a “terminology zoo”. The lack of clear terminology is not “useful from a practical point of view” and a “source of confusion for the end user”. A company operating in the IoT space could be working in anything related to sensor technology, networking, embedded systems, or analytics. According to Lonergan, the term IoT was coined before smart phones, tablets, and devices {{as we know them}} today existed, and there is a long list of terms with varying degrees of overlap and technological convergence: Internet of things, Internet of everything (IoE), industrial Internet, pervasive computing, pervasive sensing, ubiquitous computing, cyber-physical systems (CPS), wireless sensor networks (WSN), smart objects, cooperating objects, machine to machine (M2M), ambient intelligence (AmI), <b>operational</b> <b>technology</b> (OT), and information technology (IT). Regarding IIoT, an industrial sub-field of IoT, the Industrial Internet Consortium's Vocabulary Task Group has created a [...] "common and reusable vocabulary of terms" [...] to ensure [...] "consistent terminology" [...] across publications issued by the Industrial Internet Consortium. IoT One has created an IoT Terms Database including a New Term Alert to be notified when a new term is published. As of March 2017, this database aggregates 711 IoT-related terms, however, without any attempts to reduce terminological ambiguity and complexity.|$|E

40|$|Innovation {{depends on}} new ideas {{entering}} an organization and being translated into something implemented and used. This article identifies {{the determinants of}} this knowledge acquisition and transfer. Knowledge is diffused {{through a variety of}} networks. One potentially important network is formed by professional associations, which diffuse a specific body of knowledge to practitioners and create informal networks of weak ties, linking members from different organizations. A survey of a particular association's members is used to identify the variables that predict the level of two types of technological innovation. Results show that professional association networks are important for innovation in specific, <b>operational</b> <b>technologies,</b> although infernal communication factors and organization size are also significant predictors For more complex technologies that have implications for the overall philosophy of operations, different predictors-the existence of a technology strategy, the level of external communication, and the level of influence of individuals-are relevant. ...|$|R

Introducing new technologies into Smart Grid raises new issues, mainly security issues. Therefore, in this paper, after presenting the Smart Grid and the smart metering system, we present the security requirements of the Smart Grid and we highlight the user privacy concern as well as the different techniques proposed in literature to deal with it.

Proposed paper presents a detailed methodology for the substantiated choices of transport infrastructure development in case of long distance haul and high speed passenger travel, adequate for efficient resources consume (space, energy, finances). Practical aspects are revealed in the present comparative study regarding space and equivalent energy consumption, conducted for two land infrastructures, highway and high speed rail, connecting the same origin and destination points. As a result, although both services have their benefits and costs, high speed rail is recommended as a sustainable development action, ranking better than highway infrastructure. Recommendations concerning methodological clarifications and practical aspects are made in order to insure the best practice considering a sustainable network based transport infrastructure assessment process...|$|R
