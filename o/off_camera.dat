5|$|Rik Mayall {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Peeves, a {{poltergeist}} who likes to prank students in the novel.

Tom Felton portrays Draco Malfoy, the trio's enemy. Zoë Wanamaker portrays Madam Hooch, the flying teacher of Hogwarts. Sean Biggerstaff portrays Oliver Wood, captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. James and Oliver Phelps appear as Fred and George Weasley, Ron's older twin brothers.

Matthew Lewis, Devon Murray and Alfred Enoch portray Neville Longbottom, Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, respectively.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} aspect {{that led}} to disagreement amongst {{the cast and crew}} was the genuine killing of animals. Kerman stormed off the set while the death of the coatimundi was filmed, and Yorke refused to participate in the killing of a pig, which he was originally scripted to execute, leaving the duty to Luca Barbareschi. When it was shot, the squeal of the pig subsequently caused Yorke to botch a long monologue, and retakes were not an option because they had no access to additional pigs. Perry Pirkanen cried after filming the butchering of a turtle, and crew members vomited <b>off</b> <b>camera</b> when a squirrel monkey was killed for the film. Actress Francesca Ciardi also objected to the film's sexual content {{and did not want to}} bare her breasts during the sex scene between her and Carl Yorke. When she refused to comply with Deodato's direction, he dragged her off the set and screamed at her in Italian. She had earlier suggested that she and Yorke actually have sex in the jungle before filming in order to relieve the tension of the upcoming scene. When Yorke declined, she grew upset with him, alienating him for the rest of the shoot.|$|E

25|$|The show's {{unprecedented}} {{access to}} police departments has generated some controversy because such access is not typically given to traditional local news media. Moreover, {{the show has}} been criticized for putting witnesses in danger by revealing their faces and their voices on a nationally televised program and for not being sensitive to what might happen to them in the form of retaliation. In response to such criticism, witnesses often ask producers to have their faces blurred out and voices changed or to speak <b>off</b> <b>camera.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bea Arthur and Betty White {{worked well}} {{together}} in shared mutual respect {{but they did}} not pursue a personal friendship with one another outside of The Golden Girls set. However, both were close to Rue McClanahan <b>off</b> <b>camera.</b> Arthur and White were consummate professionals and thoroughly enjoyed their experiences on the show despite having only a work relationship with one another. Betty White has always expressed nothing but love and admiration for Bea Arthur. Only after Arthur's death in 2009 did she reveal the fundamental personality clash between Arthur and herself. White's positive, perky demeanor would sometimes irritate Arthur.|$|E
25|$|Very {{nearly as}} {{visually}} evocative are the scenes involving Astor, {{almost all of}} which suggest prison.

Huston and Edeson crafted each scene to make sure the images, action and dialog blended effectively, sometimes shooting closeups of characters with other cast members acting with them <b>off</b> <b>camera.</b>|$|E

During <b>OFF</b> PLUS <b>CAMERA</b> the solemn premiere of Janusz Majewski’s [...] "Little Baccaulaureate 1947" [...] (Mała matura 1947) was also held. What was new during that edition of <b>OFF</b> PLUS <b>CAMERA</b> was [...] "Roofing in Kraków".

25|$|The film {{cemented}} {{a strong}} {{personal and professional}} connection between Bogart and Huston. Bogart admired and somewhat envied Huston for his skill as a writer. Though a poor student, Bogart was a lifelong reader. He could quote Plato, Pope, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and over a thousand lines of Shakespeare. He subscribed to the Harvard Law Review. He admired writers, {{and some of his}} best friends were screenwriters, including Louis Bromfield, Nathaniel Benchley, and Nunnally Johnson. Bogart enjoyed intense, provocative conversation and stiff drinks, as did Huston. Both were rebellious and liked to play childish pranks. Huston was reported to be easily bored during production, and admired Bogart (also bored easily <b>off</b> <b>camera)</b> not just for his acting talent but for his intense concentration on the set.|$|E
25|$|Fabrizio ruled for {{the state}} that News 12 had {{to turn over the}} complete, {{unedited}} interview. While News 12 had argued that the state had failed to demonstrate any basis for supposing that Bonie had confessed to the crime <b>off</b> <b>camera,</b> the judge said that the prosecution sought to learn whether he had made admissions relevant to the case. Raimundi's narration described Bonie making positive statements about his relationship with Moore. Even the defense agreed the issue of the Section 8 applications was a central and relevant one in the case. The judge did not find that Bonie had been promised confidentiality by News 12, and there was no possible other way {{for the state}} to find out what he might have said that was not broadcast. The judge's one concession to News 12 was that he would review the recorded interview in camera and release to the prosecution only those sections that discussed Bonie and Moore's landlord-tenant relationship and/or the Section 8 issue.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the first}} 35 minutes, there were {{technical}} difficulties with the Fort Worth TV relay {{as well as}} with the phone link MacNeil was using to report from the hospital. When the coverage began, McGee was waiting for MacNeil to call in with information. While Ryan and Huntley were recounting the information, McGee got MacNeil on the line and told him to recount chronologically what happened. However, NBC was using a studio that wasn't equipped to patch calls through to the air and thus only McGee could hear MacNeil. While the studio crew worked on a solution, McGee improvised and told MacNeil to relay the information in fragments, which he would then repeat for the audience. While they were talking, Huntley was handed a speaker from <b>off</b> <b>camera</b> and took the receiver from McGee so he could attach it to the earpiece, this enabling MacNeil to be heard. However, by that time there was no further information to report; MacNeil had a medical student from Parkland hold the phone line for him so that he could return to the emergency ward for the latest developments.|$|E

25|$|The January 22, 1973 {{broadcast}} of the CBS Evening News saw Cronkite break {{the news of the}} death of another notable American political figure: former president Lyndon B. Johnson. At approximately 6:38pm Eastern Time, while a pre-recorded report that the Vietnam peace talks in Paris had been successful was being played for the audience, Cronkite received a telephone call in the studio while <b>off</b> <b>camera.</b> The call was from Tom Johnson, former spokesman to Lyndon Johnson (no relation), who at the time was also in charge of KTBC, CBS' Austin, Texas affiliate, which the former president owned. During the conversation the production staff cut away from the report back to the live camera in studio as Cronkite was still on the phone. After he was made aware that he was back on camera, Cronkite held up a finger to let everyone watching know he required a moment to let Johnson finish talking. Once Cronkite got what he needed, he thanked Johnson and asked him to stay on the line. He then turned to the camera and began to relay what Johnson had said to him.|$|E

[...] "I {{was just going to}} do it <b>off</b> <b>camera,</b> but the student extras laughed so hard when they heard my voice that (Hughes) said do it on camera, improvise, something you know a lot about. When I gave the lecture about supply-side economics, I thought they were applauding. Everybody on the set applauded. I thought they were applauding because they had learned something about supply-side economics. But they were applauding because they thought I was boring...It was the best day of my life", Stein said.|$|E
500|$|Como's CBS {{contract}} was {{to expire on}} July 1, 1955. The year before, he {{had been asked to}} be the master of ceremonies and narrator of the NBC Radio 35th anniversary special. That April, Perry Como signed a 12-year [...] "unbreakable" [...] contract with NBC. On his last CBS show, June 24, 1955, Como was in high spirits, bringing all those who worked <b>off</b> <b>camera</b> on the air for introductions. Perry tried his hand at camera work, getting a picture on the air but one that was upside-down. In appreciation for the 11-year association, his sponsor, Chesterfield, presented him with all the musical arrangements used during this time as a parting gift.|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 990 feet long, {{was released}} on February 28, 1911. The film received mixed reviews by critics with the sharpest criticism of the improbable and illogical feats the [...] "little mother" [...] would perform. The Billboard said, [...] "There is {{too much of the}} made-to-order situations in this film, causing the spectator to stretch his imagination to the straining point. That a little tot can accomplish in a way of detective work the feat set to 'kid' actor in this film performs, is hardly logical. The acting of the Thanhouser tot is great, giving the picture the greater part of the interest it contains. The other players acquit themselves well." [...] The Moving Picture World largely agreed, but stated that the film only had one or two parts of the film were weak and the photography and acting were good. The Morning Telegraph found that the film would have been more logical should a scene with a police court to release the artist, for the police {{would not have been able}} to release them otherwise after the charges had been brought forth. The New York Dramatic Mirror review however states that this scene did occur with Marie acting outside the room and being consulted by an officer, whereupon the action take place <b>off</b> <b>camera.</b> The reviewer also stated that the production was admirably staged and acted.|$|E
