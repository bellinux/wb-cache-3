30|$|Transport {{of toxic}} {{substances}} is connected with a rather high risk because traffic accidents are quite common and because easily flammable substances can be released (e.g., fuel). However, the transported amounts of ENM are currently rather small, compared to {{the total amount of}} produced material in any size (compare 5 Mio t of produced TiO 2 of which only 47, 000 [*]t are nano-TiO 2 [17], {{and this is one of}} the nanomaterials with the highest production amounts). Although there is currently no nano-specific <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>label,</b> we propose that the containers for transport of ENM should be labeled as a hazardous material and that containers of the highest safety standards be used. An accident during transport could lead to the spilling of dispersions/powder or a fire through which ENM could reach air, soil, wastewater, or natural waters (Figure  1).|$|E
40|$|Dietetic {{foods are}} {{foodstuffs}} intended to satisfy particular nutritional requirements. The German legislation on dietetic foods (Verordnung über diätetische Lebensmittel) defines which regulations these foods are subject to. In Germany, the current discussion {{focuses on the}} removal of the regulation for specific dietetic foods for diabetics and to replace the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>label</b> carbohydrate exchanges with a uniform European nutrition labelling on packaged foods. BfR has already stated in several opinions that in terms of nutritional physiology, diabetic foods which, for example, advertise with a low glycaemic index, are unnecessary. In addition, the Institute is working on recommendations for standardised nutrition labelling. In light of recent discussion, the present BfR opinion asses whether the aspired alterations are contrary to the special dietary needs of individuals with a glucose metabolism disorder. Specifically in its opinion on the Jenkins study (BfR, 2009), BfR already looked into the current study results from 2008 - 2009. In the present opinion, the Institute assesses the international study results from 2002 - 2007. BfR again concludes that a diet with a low glycaemic index does not necessitate any special dietary requirements for diabetics since the vast amount of study results lead to different conclusions. This result corresponds to the draft of an EFSA opinion published just recently. The concept of carbohydrate exchanges (BE or KE) is unique in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Yet the concept offers no precisely defined values but rather provides estimated units that are applied differently in each country. Many European diabetes associations are thus asking for uniform and extended nutrition labelling on packaged foods...|$|E

In 1976, Stephen Stills and Neil Young invited the duo to a recording session for their album Long May You Run. Crosby and Nash were forced to leave the recording session because they had time constraints for completing their second album for ABC Records, so Stills and Young wiped their vocals, releasing it as The Stills-Young Band.

5000|$|After his {{resurgence}} on {{the country}} charts, Lewis and producer Jerry Kennedy opted to record two albums worth of classic country songs in four sessions spread over two days as a way <b>to</b> fulfill his <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> his record <b>label,</b> Smash, for 1969. As country music historian Colin Escott notes in his essay for the 1986 retrospective The Killer: The Smash/Mercury Years, [...] "Not only did this avoid the problem of screening new material but it also gained Jerry some instant credibility in his new found quest {{to be viewed as}} a country artist." [...] The album includes country standards such as [...] "Sweet Dreams", made famous by Patsy Cline, and the classic Hank Williams lament [...] "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry". The duet [...] "Jackson" [...] features Linda Gail Lewis. Critics have often cited the rushed nature of the sessions as a reason for the album's uniform feel when compared to Lewis's previous albums Another Place, Another Time and She Still Comes Around, but in truth the tight schedule likely had little impact since Lewis would usually record no more than two takes of a song if he could get away with it. The album soared to number 2 on the Billboard country albums chart.|$|R
