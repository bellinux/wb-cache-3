40|$|In {{order to}} discuss the {{aesthetics}} <b>of</b> <b>sport</b> I shall start with some metaphysical considerations: instead of using the notion of essence (definition) <b>of</b> <b>sport,</b> understood {{as a set of}} necessary and sufficient conditions, I shall try to base these considerations on the notion of the nature <b>of</b> <b>sport.</b> In my understanding, the nature <b>of</b> <b>sport</b> is a very basic phenomenon that lies at the origin and shapes the history <b>of</b> <b>sport.</b> It is a technology of training and mastering physical skills valued for themselves. Now, the aesthetic dimension <b>of</b> <b>sport</b> is based on the technically valuable qualities <b>of</b> <b>sports,</b> which are the consecutive properties <b>of</b> <b>sport.</b> Such qualities are present in all types <b>of</b> <b>sport,</b> not only in the so-called ‘aesthetic sports’ (Best) or ‘performances’ (Suits). Finally, I advance a thesis that although sport is not a form of art, its aesthetic dimension is closer to the nature <b>of</b> <b>sport</b> than its ethical dimension...|$|R

5|$|Red, {{white and}} blue have been the colours of every jersey design in the club's history; however, the jersey design has {{undergone}} several alterations.

Eastern Suburbs Rugby League club adopted these colours in 1908, with its predecessor Rugby Union club, also known as Eastern Suburbs in the Sydney club Rugby Union, having played in the tri-colours.

Although the width and the order of these stripes have changed, the basic design has always been maintained.|$|E

5|$|Scotland's home matches are {{presently}} {{covered by the}} pay-TV broadcaster Sky Sports. Television rights to away games vary; Sky Sports currently hold the rights to both home and away qualifiers for Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup. The arrangements to show Scotland matches on pay-TV have been criticised by the Scottish Government, who have argued that qualifying matches {{should be included in}} the list <b>of</b> <b>sporting</b> events which can only be broadcast on free-to-air television. The SFA have argued that limiting the rights to free-to-air broadcasters would severely reduce the amount of revenue that they could generate. An independent advisory panel recommended that qualifying matches played by all four Home Nations be added to the list, but UK Sports Minister Hugh Robertson deferred a decision until the completion of the digital switchover.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} super Barcelona {{has often been}} political. Though it is a club created and run by foreigners, Barcelona {{gradually}} became a club associated with Catalan values. In Spain's transition to autocracy in 1925, Catalonia became increasingly hostile towards the central government in Madrid. The hostility enhanced Barcelona's image as {{a focal point for}} Catalonism, and when Francisco Franco banned the use of the Catalan language, the stadium of Barcelona became {{one of the few places}} the people could express their dissatisfaction. The Spanish transition to democracy in 1978 has not dampened the club's image of Catalan pride. In the 2000s – a period <b>of</b> <b>sporting</b> success in the club and an increased focus on Catalan players – club officials have openly called for Catalonia to become an independent state.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the name}} piping shrike, the white-backed magpie was {{declared}} the official {{emblem of the}} Government of South Australia in 1901 by Governor Tennyson, and has featured on the South Australian flag since 1904. The magpie is a commonly used emblem <b>of</b> <b>sporting</b> teams in Australia, and its brash, cocky attitude has been likened to the Australian psyche. Such teams tend to wear uniforms with black and white stripes. The Collingwood Football Club adopted the magpie from a visiting South Australian representative team in 1892. The Port Adelaide Magpies would similarly adopt {{the black and white}} colours and Magpie name in 1902. Other examples include Brisbane's Souths Logan Magpies, and Sydney's Western Suburbs Magpies. Disputes over who has been the first club to adopt the magpie emblem have been heated at times. Another club, Glenorchy Football Club of Tasmania, was forced to change uniform design when placed in the same league as another club (Claremont Magpies) with the same emblem.|$|E
