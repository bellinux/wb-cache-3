40|$|A 5 -week {{trial was}} {{conducted}} to compare various fat sources for the weaned pig. A total of 150 pigs were weaned at 19 days of age and allotted, by weight, to five dietary treatments. Treatments consisted of a control with no added fat and four fat sources (choice white grease, coconut oil, soybean oil and tallow). During the first 2 weeks, 10 % fat was added, and 5 % fat was added during the last 3 weeks. Average daily gain and feed/gain of weaned pigs were improved {{with the addition of}} dietary fat. During the first 2 weeks, pigs fed soybean oil had superior performance to <b>other</b> <b>pigs</b> fed additional <b>fat.</b> During the last 3 weeks and over the entire 5 week study pigs fed choice, white grease and soybean oil had a faster rate of gain and were more feed efficient than <b>pigs</b> fed the <b>other</b> <b>fat</b> sources. Among the four fat sources, tallow appeared to be least effective at improving pig performance...|$|R

It is a semi-soft white fat with a high saturated fatty acid content and no transfats. Refined lard is usually sold as paper-wrapped blocks.|$|R
50|$|Several {{months of}} {{increasing}} tensions coupled with various incidents preceded the actual rebellion.

60|$|This famous mutiny {{occurred}} {{while the}} reins of British rule in India were {{in the hands of}} Lord Canning. Chupattees (cakes of flour and water) were circulated among the natives, placards protesting against British rule were posted at Delhi, and when the Enfield rifle with its greased cartridges was introduced among the Sepoy soldiers serving the Queen it was rumored that the cartridges were smeared with the forbidden <b>pig's</b> <b>fat,</b> so that the power of the Sepoys might forever be destroyed.|$|R

50|$|After {{several years}} of {{increasing}} tension among the sepoys (Indian soldiers) of the British East India Company's Bengal Army, the sepoys at Meerut, 43 mi northeast of Delhi, openly rebelled against their British officers. The flashpoint was {{the introduction of the}} Pattern 1853 Enfield rifle. The cartridges for this were widely believed to be greased with a mixture of cow and <b>pig</b> <b>fat,</b> and to bite them open when loading the rifle (as required by the drill books) would defile both Hindu and Muslim soldiers.|$|R
50|$|Gordon and Pandey's {{friendship}} is challenged following {{the introduction of}} a new rifle: the Enfield rifled musket. Rumours spread among the sepoys that the paper cartridges, which hold the powder and ball for the rifle, are greased with either <b>pig</b> <b>fat</b> or beef tallow. The process of loading the rifle requires the soldier to bite the down on the cartridge, and the soldiers believe that this would cause them to consume pork or beef — acts abhorrent to Muslim and Hindu soldiers for religious reasons.|$|R

The defenders retreated behind the great stone diving wall {{in the center of}} the keep. On 30 November the defenders finally surrendered.|$|R

The precision of the HPLC system was excellent, showing RSD values of repeatability lower than 5. 27 % for detector response and 0. 12 % for retention times.

The fatty acid compositions of total lipids, TG, and PL in the tissues studied were characterized for high concentrations of oleic (18 : 1, n- 9), palmitic (16 : 0), and stearic (18 : 0) acids.
