5|$|In {{the case}} of mothers of young children, Russian law allows for {{deferment}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>prison</b> sentence until the child reaches the age of 14.

5|$|Talbot, a Republican, {{served in}} the Massachusetts {{legislature}} beginning in 1851, {{and sat in the}} governor's council from 1864 to 1869. In 1872, he was elected Lieutenant Governor, serving two terms under William B. Washburn. On the selection of Washburn to the United States Senate by the state legislature in early 1874, he became acting governor. One item of unfinished business Washburn left to Talbot was a bill mandating a ten-hour workday. This matter had been the subject of labor agitation in the state, and Washburn had been opposed to the bill. Talbot, despite his mill ownership, was an advocate, and signed the bill into law. He also refused to authorize construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>prison</b> in Concord, and signed legislation allowing women to vote for members of local school committees.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} produced {{heavy rainfall}} along the coastline, including {{a total of}} 19.1inches (486mm) measured in a 48‑hour period in Acapulco. Totals of over 2inches (50mm) spread across much of Guerrero and Oaxaca, causing flash flooding and mudslides. The storm partially flooded about 40houses, {{and a total of}} 72people were forced to leave their homes. In Acapulco, floodwaters washed trash from street corners onto the beaches. Elsewhere in Guerrero, the flooding and mudslides blocked several highways, which stranded dozens of vehicles. The wall <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>prison</b> collapsed due to the rainfall. Also in Acapulco, the rainfall downed trees and power lines, causing power outages and sparking a fire when a transformer exploded. No deaths were reported.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, the {{government}} allocated $5.1 billion for new prison space.

25|$|Many {{youngsters who}} had {{experienced}} the living conditions in China's slum {{had grown up in}} a culture of poverty and often saw criminal offences, such as petty theft, as {{the only way to get}} regular meals.

However, neither text is referenced in any of Gongsun's documents, and his actions don't seem to reflect the Gongyang. His family being poor, he did not learn much of the Annals until he was forty, and the Shiji considers his ability secondary to that of Dong Zhongshu.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the roles}} castles {{commonly}} filled was that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>prison.</b> From the late 17thcentury onwards this became Portchester's most important function. In 1665, 500prisoners from the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665–1667) were held at the castle. Some were housed in {{the church in the}} outer bailey. They damaged the building by setting it on fire. The church was not repaired until some 40years later. Between 1702 and 1712 the Crown leased Portchester Castle from the Uvedales to incarcerate prisoners from the War of the Spanish Succession. The first detailed accounts of the prisoners' conditions come {{from the middle of the}} century.|$|E
25|$|On February 16, 1862, the Union Army under then Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant {{captured}} Fort Donelson, on the Cumberland River, and Fort Henry, on the Tennessee River, near Dover.

Colonel Tucker told General Grant's superior, Major General Henry W.
