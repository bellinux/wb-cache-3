40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the mechanical behavior of buried steel pipeline crossing subsidence strata. The investigation {{is based on}} numerical simulation of the nonlinear response of the pipeline-soil system through finite element method, considering large strain and displacement, inelastic material behavior of buried pipeline and the surrounding soil, as well as contact and friction on the pipeline-soil interface. Effects of key parameters on the mechanical behavior of buried pipeline were investigated, such as strata subsidence, diameter-thickness ratio, buried depth, internal pressure, friction coefficient and soil properties. The {{results show that the}} maximum strain appears on the outer transition subsidence section of the pipeline, and its cross section is concave shaped. With the increasing of strata subsidence and diameter-thickness ratio, the <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>roundness,</b> longitudinal strain and equivalent plastic strain increase gradually. With the buried depth increasing, the deflection, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>roundness</b> and strain of the pipeline decrease. Internal pressure and friction coefficient have little effect on the deflection of buried pipeline. <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>roundness</b> is reduced and the strain is increased gradually with the increasing of internal pressure.
