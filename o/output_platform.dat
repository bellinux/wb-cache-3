The 'Mixed Object' moniker refers {{to the fact that}} a MO:DCA file can contain multiple types of objects, including text, images, vector graphics, and even objects marked as 'barcodes'. An application can simply include a string of digits along with controls that identify a specific type of barcode, and the rendering of bars will be done on the <b>output</b> <b>platform</b> (physical printer hardware or software emulation). A MO:DCA file consists of a sequential, ordered hierarchy of independent objects - documents, pages, data objects, and resource objects such as fonts and ICC profiles. Each object is delimited by begin/end structures, and objects to be rendered specify presentation parameters and resource requirements in structures called [...] "environment groups". Since the pages in MO:DCA documents appear in sequential order, presentation can start as soon as the first page is received. The MO:DCA format is comparable to other PDLs that specify distinct pages such as PDF. MO:DCA-P is sometimes called AFPDS (AFP Data Stream).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A new three {{degrees of}} freedom (3 -DOF) transla-tional {{parallel}} manipulator (TPM) constructed only with pris-matic (P), cylindrical (C), revolute (R) joints has been proposed in this paper. The mobility of the 3 -PCR TPM is analyzed via screw theory. Afterwards, the inverse kinematics, forward kine-matics, and velocity analysis are performed and the singularity problems are investigated. In addition, the reachable workspace has been determined analytically and compared with and without consideration of mechanical constraints. It is shown that the 3 -PCR TPM owns a smaller size <b>output</b> <b>platform</b> than the existing 3 -PRC one, and then has more wide applications. In view of applications, the 3 -PCR TPM is adopted as a CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) medical robot, and another new 3 -PCR TPM with an orthogonal architecture is presented and its application in micro/nano scale manipulation has been exhibited through the employment into an automatic biological cell injection system.

40|$|Recent {{technological}} advances in input sensing, {{as well as}} ultra-small projectors, have opened up new opportunities for interaction – {{the use of the}} body itself as both an input and <b>output</b> <b>platform.</b> Such on-body interfaces offer new interac-tive possibilities, and the promise of access to computation, communication and information literally in the palm of our hands. The unique context of on-body interaction allows us to take advantage of extra dimensions of input our bodies naturally afford us. In this paper, we consider how the arms and hands can be used to enhance on-body interactions, which is typically finger input centric. To explore this op-portunity, we developed Armura, a novel interactive on-body system, supporting both input and graphical output. Using this platform as a vehicle for exploration, we proto-typed many applications and interactions. This helped to confirm chief use modalities, identify fruitful interaction approaches, and in general, better understand how interfaces operate on the body. We highlight the most compelling techniques we uncovered. Further, this paper is the first to consider and prototype how conventional interaction issues, such as cursor control and clutching, apply to the on-body domain. Finally, we bring to light several new and unique interaction techniques. ACM Classification: H. 5. 2 [Information interfaces an...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} applies {{a commercial}} flow simulation software package together with common signal processing techniques {{to the task}} of accurately detecting leakage in a large commercial gas pipeline. The techniques developed significantly improved the ability to produce accurate, reliable and stable leak detection predictions for the gas transmission pipeline studied and can be applied generally to other pipelines as well. Recommendations for minimum pipeline requirements to implement successful leak detection are also detailed. There are several commercial software packages available that perform some form of leak detection via system modelling. However, due to the commercial aspects of these products, vendors do not publish the detailed methods of leak detection. This thesis identifies the fundamental techniques required to have accurate and reliable leak detection on a gas transmission pipeline, whilst taking into account the lack of measurement data typically encountered on most gas pipelines. The investigation confirmed that a mass balance technique could be successfully used to produce stable leak detection results for compressible flow in gas transmission pipelines. This leak detection [using mass balance] can be achieved without flow measurement along the pipeline, instead, using only pressure and temperature measurements. Although it is recognized that flow measurement data will greatly improve the ability to detect leaks, the focus of this work is on pipelines where this flow measurement data at intermediate points along the pipeline is not available. It was also demonstrated the reliability of the leak detection was improved by the application of on-line signal processing techniques at various stages of the data processing. It was clear early into the investigation {{that the majority of the}} errors within the leak detection model were created by random errors from the input field data. These non-systematic errors from the measurement data that included pressure and temperature, produced interference with model output. This interference resembled random “white” noise that was removed by a combination of well established data filtering techniques. The most appropriate process of calculating leak detection flow was determined after analysing the results of different techniques applied to large quantities of actual pipeline operating data. The validation of the on-line techniques developed provides a valuable resource for those wishing to implement similar leak detection schemes elsewhere. Furthermore a software environment was chosen which incorporated an open input and <b>output</b> <b>platform</b> for data that could be interfaced with any operating system. Therefore these techniques can be applied to the numerous Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems in operation throughout the gas transmission industry, to provide a low cost solution to leak monitoring...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Much {{has been}} written about how the medical home model can enhance patient-centeredness, care continuity, and follow-up, but few {{comprehensive}} aids or resources exist to help practices accomplish these aims. The complexity of primary care can overwhelm those concerned with quality improvement. Methods The RE-AIM planning and evaluation model was used to develop a multimedia, multiple-health behavior tool with psychosocial assessment and feedback features to facilitate and guide patient-centered communication, care, and follow-up related to prevention and self-management of the most common adult chronic illnesses seen in primary care. Results The Connection to Health Patient Self-Management System, a web-based patient assessment and support resource, was developed using the RE-AIM factors of reach (e. g., allowing input and output via choice of different modalities), effectiveness (e. g., using evidence-based intervention strategies), adoption (e. g., assistance in integrating the system into practice workflows and permitting customization of the website and feedback materials by practice teams), implementation (e. g., identifying and targeting actionable priority behavioral and psychosocial issues for patients and teams), and maintenance/sustainability (e. g., integration with current National Committee for Quality Assurance recommendations and clinical pathways of care). Connection to Health can work on a variety of input and <b>output</b> <b>platforms,</b> and assesses and provides feedback on multiple health behaviors and multiple chronic conditions frequently managed in adult primary care. As such, it should help to make patient-healthcare team encounters more informed and patient-centered. Formative research with clinicians indicated that the program addressed a number of practical concerns and they appreciated the flexibility and how the Connection to Health program could be customized to their office. Conclusions This primary care practice tool based on an implementation science model has the potential to guide patients to more healthful behaviors and improved self-management of chronic conditions, while fostering effective and efficient communication between patients and their healthcare team. RE-AIM and similar models can help clinicians and media developers create practical products more likely to be widely adopted, feasible in busy medical practices, and able to produce public health impact. </p...|$|R

From this specification we can produce <b>output</b> for <b>platforms</b> such as stand-alone applications, Webbased user interfaces or formatted print output.

Modifications and/or extensions of the underlying data structure require an adaptation of each single view realized in a certain technology. This results in considerable modification and migration effort. The key idea of our approach is to separate the elements that are identical in each view in a platformindependent description.

A 3 -axis {{parallel}} loading mechanism, which {{works as a}} multi-axis load simulator, is proposed for reliability test of multi-axis CNC machine tools by exerting specific load spectrums on the spindle. To achieve efficient loading force control, dynamic model of the 3 -DOF translational parallel robot is derived via the virtual work principle and is embedded into the control strategy to build a model-based control scheme. A mass distribution factor is introduced and the rotating inertia of the limbs is neglected to simplify the dynamics equations for better real-time control performance. This simplification method is verified by comparison with the complete dynamics model. Then the simplified dynamic model is integrated with a PI (proportional–integral) controller with feedforward to control the moving <b>platform’s</b> <b>output</b> force in the task space and this control strategy is verified through co-simulations with MATLAB/Simulink and ADAMS.

The methodology starts with the thermal hydraulic analysis of the NPP with a system code (such as Relap 5, Cathare 2, etc.), during a selected transient scenario, in order to calculate the cooling loads induced on the internal RPV wall surface by the Emergency Core Coolant (ECC) injection. The results so obtained are then processed to provide boundary conditions for the next step, i. e. a CFD calculation of the mixing phenomena occurring at small scale on the RPV welding lines region of the down-comer.
