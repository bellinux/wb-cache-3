50|$|It is {{a member}} of the {{subfamily}} Satyrinae in the family Nymphalidae. A similar species is the meadow brown; the two species can be difficult to distinguish with closed wings since the underwing markings are very similar. However, the gatekeeper tends to rest with its wings open, whereas the <b>meadow</b> <b>brown</b> usually rests with its wings closed. The gatekeeper is also smaller and more orange than the <b>meadow</b> <b>brown</b> and has double pupils on its eyespots.|$|R

50|$|The {{butterfly}} loosely {{resembles a}} small <b>meadow</b> <b>brown,</b> but the brown of the wings appears noticeably paler in flight. Unlike the <b>meadow</b> <b>brown</b> and other common members of Satyrinae, the small heath is a lateral basker, only ever resting with its wings closed and angled at 90° to the sun. It more closely resembles Coenonympha caeca (forewing without apical spots), Coenonympha tullia (forewing apical spot smaller), Coenonympha symphita (underside of hindwing without white spot {{and almost always}} with a complete row of spots on the forewing).|$|R
50|$|The Sardinian <b>meadow</b> <b>brown</b> (Maniola nurag) is a {{butterfly}} {{belonging to the}} family Nymphalidae. It is a small butterfly with orange and brown colouring. The butterfly is only found in Sardinia.|$|R

50|$|The {{site has}} woodland, a pond, scrub and grassland. Flora include blackthorns, hawthorns and bee orchids, there are birds such as blackcaps and willow warblers, and common blue and <b>meadow</b> <b>brown</b> butterflies.|$|R
50|$|The <b>meadow</b> <b>brown</b> is {{univoltine}} {{and adults}} emerge {{over a long}} period (spring, summer and autumn). Some individuals have a short larval development time and produce late adults. This is genetically controlled.|$|R
50|$|In the wet {{woodland}} {{the typical}} species are {{great spotted woodpecker}} and musk beetle. Cuckoo {{can be heard in}} the summer. In the meadows of Magor Marsh the common butterflies are orange tip and <b>meadow</b> <b>brown.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hyponephele lycaon, the dusky <b>meadow</b> <b>brown,</b> is a {{butterfly}} species {{belonging to the}} family Nymphalidae. It is broadly distributed in the temperate zone of the Palearctic from Portugal {{in the west to}} the Russian Far East in the east.|$|R

50|$|These traditionally-managed species-rich meadows {{support a}} neutral {{grassland}} {{community of the}} nationally rare common knapweed crested dog's-tail type.

50|$|As {{indicated}} by its alternate name, the gatekeeper butterfly prefers the habitat of meadow margins and hedges; field gates {{are often in}} such locations, and thus the gatekeeper can be found much more frequently in such locations than the <b>meadow</b> <b>brown</b> for example.|$|R
50|$|The park {{is home to}} 17 {{species of}} {{butterflies}} which include regal Apollo (Parnassius charltonius), common blue Apollo (Parnassius hardwickii), common red Apollo (Parnassius epaphus), brown argus (Ypthima hyagriva), <b>meadow</b> <b>brown</b> (Hyponephele pulchra), narrow-banded satyr (Aulocera brahminus) and large tortoiseshell (Nymphalis xanthomelas).|$|R
50|$|This meadow {{has never}} been {{ploughed}} and it is managed in a traditional way to encourage uncommon plants, such as great burnet and pepper-saxifrage.
