25|$|The mouth lies in {{the centre}} of the <b>oral</b> <b>surface</b> in regular urchins, or towards one end in {{irregular}} urchins. It is surrounded by lips of softer tissue, with numerous small, bony pieces embedded in it. This area, called the peristome, also includes five pairs of modified tube feet and, in many species, five pairs of gills. On the upper surface, opposite the mouth, is the periproct, which surrounds the anus. The periproct contains a variable number of hard plates, depending on species, one of which contains the madreporite. The structure of the mouth and teeth {{have been found to be}} so efficient at grasping and grinding that their structure has been tested for use in real-world applications.|$|E
500|$|The gut of a starfish {{occupies}} most of {{the disc}} and extends into the arms. The mouth {{is located in the}} centre of the <b>oral</b> <b>surface,</b> where it is surrounded by a tough [...] membrane and closed with a sphincter. The mouth opens through a short oesophagus into a stomach divided by a constriction into a larger, [...] cardiac portion and a smaller pyloric portion. The cardiac stomach is glandular and pouched, and is supported by ligaments attached to ossicles in the arms so it can be pulled back into position after it has been everted. The pyloric stomach has two extensions into each arm: the pyloric caeca. These are elongated, branched hollow tubes that are lined by a series of glands, which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients from the food. A short intestine and rectum run from the pyloric stomach to open at a small anus at the apex of the aboral surface of the disc.|$|E
500|$|The {{next stage}} in {{development}} is a brachiolaria larva and involves the growth of three short, additional arms. These are [...] at the anterior end, surround a sucker and have adhesive cells at their tips. Both bipinnaria and brachiolaria larvae are bilaterally symmetrical. When fully developed, the brachiolaria settles on the seabed and attaches itself with a short stalk formed from the ventral arms and sucker. Metamorphosis now takes place with a radical rearrangement of tissues. The {{left side of the}} larval body becomes the <b>oral</b> <b>surface</b> of the juvenile and the right side the aboral surface. Part of the gut is retained but the mouth and anus move to new positions. Some of the body cavities degenerate but others become the water vascular system and the visceral coelom. The starfish is now pentaradially symmetrical. It casts off its stalk and becomes a free-living juvenile starfish about [...] in diameter. Starfish of the order Paxillosida have no brachiolaria stage, with the bipinnaria larvae settling on the seabed and developing directly into juveniles.|$|E

All 33 isolates were found to be hydrophobic. Variation of type of suspension medium and incubation time and repeated subculturing had no effect on hydrophobicity results.

500|$|The {{body length}} of Z. ferox varies from [...] The head in Z. ferox is broad and {{crescent-shaped}} when viewed dorsally. The frons (upper {{part of the}} insect face) is strongly convex, meaning it curves outwards and the vertexal margin concaves (curves in); it concaves either regularly or strongly. When viewing the full face, the clypeal margin (the border of the clypeus) is broad and concave. The sides are convex and small, yet protruding eyes are present. The posterior corners are round and {{the base of the}} ants' mandibles are concealed by the large expansion of the gena (area below the compound eyes, the insect equivalent to human cheeks). The clypeus is shallow and transverse, and 48 denticles that decrease in length can be seen on the clypeal margin. The denticles are peg-shaped with rounded apices. Dense spine-like setae cover the labrum (a flap-like structure in front of the mouth); these setae are organised into three rows. Each row, on average, contains around 20 setae which increase in length when they are ventral to the clypeus. The mandibles barely overlap medially, with a single large apical tooth and smaller subapical tooth present. The <b>oral</b> <b>surface</b> is covered in spicule-like setae, in which the inner setae are four times longer than the outer setae. The palps are short and the maxillary palps (sensory organs used for tasting and manipulating food) have five segments. The labial palps (counterparts of the maxillary palps used in sensory function for eating) presumably have three segments. The frontal carinae (a pair of cuticular ridges or flanges on the head) are absent in Z. ferox. The antennae are well separated and contain 12 antennomeres, and the scalps are also short; the toruli (socket in which the antenna of an insect articulates) is not significantly raised. The antennal scrobes (grooves {{in the side of the}} head) are shallow and project outwards from the antennal base and towards the ventral margin of the eyes.|$|E
500|$|The broad, {{flattened}} head of Z. tonsora is [...] {{in length}} and [...] wide (excluding eyes). It is apparently prognathous (it has a projecting lower jaw or chin), with the cervical connection found near the head. The occipital margin (around the posterodorsal region) is irregular in dorsal view and also emarginate. The postocciput (posterior rim of the insect cranium) is concave. The eyes are small but protrude from the head, and appear drop-shaped when viewed laterally. The eyes are [...] and [...] wide and are found on the posterior half of the head. The ocelli are large, being [...] in diameter. A pair of oval-shaped, melanized patches of rugose cuticles are found on the vertex. The dorsofrontal side of the ants' head has fine, sparse setulae. A protruding gena can be seen, with a narrow but extended apex well past the clypeal denticles. The dorsoventral portion of the frons has shallow V-shaped grooves that extend over the antennae bases. There {{is no evidence of}} any frontal carinae. The protruding toruli obscures the base of the antenna; the antennal bases project underneath the toruli. Shallow antennal scrobes are seen and project outwards from the antennal bases and towards the ventral margin of the eyes. The antenna is [...] long, and has a total of 12 antennomeres, with the flagellum (an antennal segment) composed of ten flagellomeres. The scapes are short, measuring , and the pedicel (the second segment of the antenna) is [...] The flagellomeres vary in length, ranging between [...] The clypeus is shallow and measures [...] (when excluding the denticles). It is broad, and the distance between its lateral-most denticles is [...] It is also more concave-shaped than it is straight. The oral margin of the clypeus is lined with a row of 30 denticles, which are peg-shaped. They also have rounded apices. The row of clypeal margin denticles is composed of two short rows. Each row is composed of 15 denticles each. The mandibles are short and barely overlap medially. The mandibles measure [...] The dentition is simple, with a large apical tooth and subapical tooth present. The masticatory margin contains no teeth, and the outside areas of the mandibles are concave. The <b>oral</b> <b>surface</b> of the mandibles has dense brushes of stiff, sharp and spicule-like setae. The labrum is covered in setae; the setae found here are longer, yet more narrow than the setae found on the clypeus. The palps are short.

2500|$|The {{lower half}} of a sea urchin's body is {{referred}} to as the <b>oral</b> <b>surface,</b> because it contains the mouth, while the upper half is the aboral surface. The internal organs are enclosed in a hard shell or [...] "test" [...] composed of fused plates of calcium carbonate covered by a thin dermis and epidermis. The test is rigid, and divides into five ambulacral grooves separated by five interambulacral areas. Each of these areas consists of two rows of plates, so the sea urchin test includes 20 rows of plates in total. The plates are covered in rounded tubercles, to which the spines are attached. The inner surface of the test is lined by peritoneum. Sea urchins convert aqueous carbon dioxide using a catalytic process involving nickel into the calcium carbonate portion of the test.|$|E
50|$|Colonies of Alveopora verrilliana are {{composed}} {{of a number of}} irregularly arranged lobes. The corallites are up to 2 mm in diameter, and the septa bear short, blunt spines.

40|$|A {{group of}} streptococci {{possessing}} {{the characteristics of}} Streptococcus miteor (S. mitis) was found to predominate on nonkeratinized human oral mucosa. These organisms averaged from 76 to 89 % of the total flora cultivable on anaerobically incubated blood agar plates from cheek, lip, and ventral tongue surfaces. They averaged 34, 40, and 18 % of the streptococci in dental plaque, in saliva, and on the tongue dorsum, respectively. Their ability to adhere to <b>oral</b> <b>surfaces</b> was studied by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains of S. miteor, S. salivarius, and S. mutans into the mouths of volunteers. Samples of <b>oral</b> <b>surfaces</b> taken 1 hr later indicated S. miteor adhered far {{better than the other}} streptococci to buccal mucosa and to teeth, but S. salivarius showed a higher affinity to the tongue dorsum. Glucose-grown cells of S. mutans adhered feebly to all <b>oral</b> <b>surfaces</b> studied and were rapidly cleared from the mouth. Cells of S. miteor and S. salivarius present naturally in saliva adhered to cleaned teeth comparable to in vitro cultivated strains. Electron microscopy of cells of S. miteor attached to buccal epithelial cells obtained from germfree rats indicated that the organisms possessed a fibrillar “fuzzy” coat which appeared to mediate their attachment to the epithelial cell membrane. This “fuzzy” coat was removed by treatment with trypsin, and it appears to be similar to that previously observed on cells of S. pyogenes and S. salivarius...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} {{the distribution of}} Veillonella and Neisseria species in the human oral cavity and indicates that their ability to attach to <b>oral</b> <b>surfaces</b> correlates with their proportions found in various sites of the mouth. The mean percentages of Veillonella and Neisseria of the total flora cultivable on anaerobic blood-agar plates was found to be: plaque, 0. 75 and < 0. 13, respectively; lip, 0. 38 and < 0. 05; cheek, 0. 66 and < 0. 14; tongue dorsum, 9. 4 and < 0. 12; saliva, 5. 0 and < 0. 9. The ability of Veillonella and Neisseria species to attach to tooth surfaces was studied by cleaning the labial surfaces of incisors to render them relatively free of viable bacteria. Samples taken 1 hr later contained < 0. 27 % Veillonella and < 0. 4 % Neisseria, whereas saliva to which these teeth were exposed contained 20 -fold higher proportions of Veillonella. These data indicate that Veillonella and Neisseria species possess a feeble ability to attach to cleaned teeth. The ability of these organisms to adhere to other <b>oral</b> <b>surfaces</b> was determined by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains into the mouths of volunteers for 5 min. Labeled strains of Streptococcus sanguis and S. salivarius were included for comparative purposes. Analysis of samples obtained from <b>oral</b> <b>surfaces</b> after 45 min indicated that Veillonella and Neisseria adhere very poorly to preformed dental plaque as compared to S. sanguis. In contrast, Veillonella adhered to the tongue dorsum markedly better than Neisseria, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius. The greater ability of Veillonella {{to adhere to the}} tongue in relation to the other organisms studied correlates with the high proportions of Veillonella found on this site. The feeble ability of Neisseria to attach to <b>surfaces</b> in the <b>oral</b> cavity is reflected by their low proportions found on these surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Lactobacilli {{were found}} in saliva, on teeth, and on the dorsum of the tongue, the {{vestibular}} mucosa, and the hard palate in humans. Their proportions in saliva, expressed as percentage of the anaerobically cultivable flora, were 10 - to 100 -fold higher than those on the tooth surface, but were comparable to those on the epithelial surfaces. The adherence of Lactobacillus casei and L. fermenti to <b>oral</b> <b>surfaces</b> was {{compared with that of}} streptomycin-labeled Streptococcus sanguis and S. salivarius by using in vitro-cultivated cells. The affinity of both Lactobacillus species for the tooth surface was very low compared with that of S. sanguis but was somewhat higher than that of S. salivarius. The lactobacilli and both Streptococcus species adhered to a similar extent to the dorsum of the tongue, whereas the affinity of the lactobacilli and S. salivarius for the vestibular mucosa was about one-half of that of S. sanguis. The results suggest that the affinity of lactobacilli for <b>oral</b> <b>surfaces</b> significantly influences their proportional distribution in the mouth. The relatively low affinity of lactobacilli for the tooth surface suggests that their recognized association with carious lesions and mechanical appliances under certain conditions may be due primarily to mechanical retention rather than unique growth conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background To {{understand}} the relationship between our bacterial microbiome and health, it is essential to define the microbiome in the absence of disease. The digestive tract includes diverse habitats and hosts the human body's greatest bacterial density. We describe the bacterial community composition of ten digestive tract sites from more than 200 normal adults enrolled in the Human Microbiome Project, and metagenomically determined metabolic potentials of four representative sites. Results The microbiota of these diverse habitats formed four groups based on similar community compositions: buccal mucosa, keratinized gingiva, hard palate; saliva, tongue, tonsils, throat; sub- and supra-gingival plaques; and stool. Phyla initially identified from environmental samples were detected throughout this population, primarily TM 7, SR 1, and Synergistetes. Genera with pathogenic members were well-represented among this disease-free cohort. Tooth-associated communities were distinct, but not entirely dissimilar, from other <b>oral</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The Porphyromonadaceae, Veillonellaceae and Lachnospiraceae families were common to all sites, but the distributions of their genera varied significantly. Most metabolic processes were distributed widely throughout the digestive tract microbiota, with variations in metagenomic abundance between body habitats. These included shifts in sugar transporter types between the supragingival plaque, other <b>oral</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and stool; hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide production were also differentially distributed. Conclusions The microbiomes of ten digestive tract sites separated into four types based on composition. A core set of metabolic pathways was present across these diverse digestive tract habitats. These data provide a critical baseline for future studies investigating local and systemic diseases affecting human health...|$|R
40|$|Fimbriae {{have been}} {{reported}} {{to play an important role}} in the adherence of Porphyromonas gingivalis to <b>oral</b> <b>surfaces</b> and possibly in triggering host responses. A structural subunit of the fimbriae, fimbrillin, has been shown to be important in binding of the bacterium to saliva-coated <b>oral</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In the present study, a coding region of the fimbrillin gene from P. gingivalis 2561 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pET- 11 d vector. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL 21, and protein expression was induced with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside. The expressed protein was purified from insoluble inclusion bodies after solubilization with urea and gel filtration chromatography. The purified recombinant fimbrillin polypeptide, r-fim 10 - 337, corresponded to amino acid residues 10 to 337 of the deduced amino acid sequence of fimbrillin. In immunoblot analysis, r-fim 10 - 337 reacted with antibodies to fimbrillin purified from P. gingivalis, as well as with antibodies to synthetic peptides corresponding to the amino acid sequence of fimbrillin. The apparent molecular mass of r-fim 10 - 337 was estimated to be 41 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The r-fim 10 - 337 polypeptide was capable of inhibiting the binding of P. gingivalis 2561 to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads. These results suggest that the fimbrillin subunit polypeptide plays an important role in binding of P. gingivalis cells to saliva-coated surfaces.
