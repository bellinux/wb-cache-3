40|$|Abstract. The {{north-eastern}} Serbia {{is one of}} {{the most}} important <b>ore</b> <b>bearing</b> areas in Yugoslavia and Balkan. The Bor and Majdanpek are world-wide known copper ore deposits. Mineralization is connected with the Upper Cretaceous magmatism. The main ore controlling factor is fracture pattern. The investigations of structural and morphological characteristics carried out in the wider Majdanpek area supplied new data on disjunctive structures and indicated an intensive neotectonic activity. A high degree of correspondence between the older fracture pattern and neotectonically active ruptures has been discovered. Tectonic activity that produced the Upper Cretaceous magmatism was prolonged through the Tertiary and Quaternary. The older ruptures were neotectonically reactivated, changing many times the sense and intensity of vertical movements. The obtained results are a reliable base for selection of perspective <b>ore</b> <b>bearing</b> areas and rational planning of further detailed field structural and metallogenic investigations...|$|R

The results from a reservoir characterization study give insight into rock and fluid properties which can optimize the choice of drilling locations and reduce risk and uncertainty. Delineating hydrocarbon <b>bearing</b> <b>zones</b> within a reservoir is the main objective of any seismic reservoir characterization study. In the current study, using limited well control and seismic data, an attempt was made to predict the productive zones of a reservoir using elastic impedance inversion. Elastic impedance logs at near and far angles of incidence have been crossplotted to find the desired productive parts of the formation. Two partial angle stack seismic data have been inverted using a model-based post-stack seismic inversion. The crossplot of the two inverted volumes is interpreted based on the results from the well location. Finally, the hydrocarbon <b>bearing</b> <b>zones</b> of the reservoir was delineated according to the seismic crossplot analysis...|$|R

50|$|Beverley is a paleaochannel uranium deposit. The uranium {{mineralisation}} (mainly coffinite) is {{hosted by}} loose sands in the channel {{of a former}} river. The <b>ore</b> <b>bearing</b> horizon is now {{at a depth of}} about 100 to 150m. The deposit is estimated to contain 21,000 tonnes of uranium oxide for a mine life of 15 to 30 years. Uranium is extracted by in-situ leaching, involving the injection of a fluid containing sulphuric acid and hydrogen peroxide into the ore-bearing permeable horizon to mobilise the uranium. The fluid is then recovered and uranium is extracted at a central plant using ion-exchange. The final concentrate is trucked to Port Adelaide and then shipped to international customers.|$|R

40|$|The large Cerro de Pasco Cordilleran {{base metal}} deposit in central Peru {{is located on}} the eastern margin of a middle Miocene diatreme-dome complex and {{comprises}} two mineralization stages. The first stage consists of a large pyrite-quartz body replacing Lower Mesozoic Pucará carbonate rocks and, to a lesser extent, diatreme breccia. This body is composed of pyrite with pyrrhotite inclusions, quartz, and black and red chalcedony (con-taining hypogene hematite). At the contact with the pyrite-quartz body, the diatreme breccia is altered to pyrite-quartz-sericite-pyrite. This body was, in part, replaced by pipelike pyrrhotite bodies zoned outward to carbonate-replacement Zn-Pb <b>ores</b> <b>bearing</b> Fe-rich sphalerite (up to 24 mol % FeS).
