The methodology consists of a literature review, a documentary research of the two magazines, and an analysis of the media representations of youth culture, values and practices. This leads to the establishment of several possible ideal-type categories that are present in the advertising narrative. Throughout the analysis, one finds that the media uses positive values attributed to youth, while contributing to cement the opposition between youth and adult...|$|E

The prepa-ration of the manuscript is completely based on electronic tools. No paper has to be produced by the authors. The default text processing system to use for preparing the manuscript is LATEX 2 ε. When the electronic manuscript is ready, please transform it in PDF format. Remember to include all the fonts in your PDF file and use only Type 1 or TrueType fonts, but, if possible, don’t use TrueType fonts. Please avoid Type 3 fonts since they are resolution-dependent. Authors should send their contributions to the editor(s) of the volume. Editors should collect all the papers and prepare a two-page preface and a table of contents, both according to the template files available via the CISM web site. Please remember that each contribution should start on a right (recto) page. Right pages have <b>odd</b> <b>page</b> numbers, and the first contribution should start on page 1.

40|$|Merle Upton's book. Capitalism and Apartheid, has excited general {{attention}} essentially {{for three}} reasons. One is Its {{engagement with the}} radical line of questioning about South African society that has been debated heatedly since the 1970 s. The second Is that It functions as an historical apologia for South African capitalism; thirdly, it contains a plea for the continued centrality of white liberals and of a middle-of-the-road politics that will crosscut the racial divide in which capitalists will play the major part. Upton thinks that capitalism and apartheid can be disengaged and she herself opts for a solution in which South Africa could "get rid of apartheid, i. e. have multi-racial (or non-racial) capita-lism 1 because she believes [...] . it could be achieved with less vio lence {{than any of the}} other [...] . (solutions); it does not rule out subsequent movement towards more egalitarian, welfare-oriented politics; and It is the only option corapat ible with the revival of the remnants of liberty and democracy: the degree of coercion required to enforce each of the other options seems incompatible with this (1986 : 12). This Is a book with which critics of the South African system have to engage seriously. It contains substantial research 1 n certain areas and Is full of insights of considerable value and originality through its 400 <b>odd</b> <b>page</b> length, nonetheless it 1 s a hard book with which to come to terms. Capitalism and Apartheid needs to be characterised but eludes easy dis-cussion. It 1 s divided Into three unbalanced parts. The middle and most substantial section, which Upton herself points out was finished basically by 1978, Is a structural and historical analysis which looks sectorally at South African capitalism, taking agriculture, mining, secondary Industry and white labour, each of which deserves substantial attention from histo-rians and economists.

30|$|More recently, Giannetti [9] {{described}} {{a model for}} linking elements from one or more streams of content over a set of page templates.

The letter came too late to be used in preparing the body of the second edition of Scrivener's work. Abbot's studies largely argumented the number of suggestions, particularly in those portions of the book devoted to describing the extant manuscripts. They were accumulated in great part to the older and well-known authorities - such as Griesbach, Matthaei, Scholz (particularly his work Biblisch-kritische Reise, Leipzig 1823), Bianchini, Montfaucon, Silvestre, Bandini, Laubecius, and Zaeagni. Part of suggestions were a result of Abbott's studies of recent edited Catalogues of the ancient Greek Manuscripts held in the British Museum, Bodleian Library, Oxford Catalogues, Kitchin's Catalogue of the manuscripts in the Library of Christ Church College (Oxrofd, 1867). Abbott added numerous references to facsimile editions.|$|R

LocoScript automatically avoided widows and orphans, ensuring that, if a paragraph of four or more lines split across pages at least two lines appeared on each page.

40|$|The Austrian theorist Joseph Schumpeter (1883 – 1950) is not {{generally}} included {{in discussions of}} classical sociology, although {{he was part of}} the political generation that included Max Weber, Georg Simmel, Gustav von Schmoller and the German Historical School. An economic theorist whose project was to synthesize insights from sociology, social psychology, and cultural and historical studies of economics, he has perhaps not been centrally established within any disciplinary boundary. His best-known work, Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (1942), has been read more in political science and sociology than economics, and for a long time his work was eclipsed by his contemporary and rival, John Maynard Keynes. However, Schumpeter’s works, and especially his concept of ‘creative destruction’, are currently receiving enthusiastic interest in business schools, which is illustrated by Thomas McCraw’s major intellectual biography (Professor of Business History in the Harvard Business School). McCraw’s volume is scholarly, thorough and systematically grounded in a comprehensive range of Schumpeter’s published works, personal papers and diaries as well as the recollections of both colleagues and intimate friends. This was possible in part because, after his death, Schumpeter’s widow and co-researcher, Elizabeth Boody, donated to Harvard his personal papers unexpurgated (p. 494). McCraw’s study is bursting with documentation, anecdotes and elaboration, and there is no sign here of the alleged decline and fall of annotation – of the 700 <b>odd</b> <b>pages,</b> around 200 are endnotes, which will probably please some and annoy others, although the endnote material is often essential reading...|$|R
