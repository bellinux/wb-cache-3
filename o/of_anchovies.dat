5|$|In January and February 2015, 1450 {{malnourished}} or sick {{sea lion}} pups {{have been found}} {{on the coast of}} California, and estimations give a higher number of dead pups. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has pointed the cause to unprecedentedly warm PDO in the North American west coast {{as a result of a}} failed attempt at El Niño, which has reduced the abundance <b>of</b> <b>anchovies,</b> sardines and mackerel, principal components of the sea lion diet just in the pups nursery season. Pups are leaving the rookeries in search of food long before they are capable of hunting fish. The outcome is pups really malnourished washed out on the shores. These conditions lead some of these pups to death if not rescued in time.|$|E
5|$|The {{leopard shark}} captures prey by {{expanding}} its buccal cavity {{to create a}} suction force, which is facilitated by its labial cartilages swinging forward to form the mouth into a tube. Simultaneously, the shark protrudes its jaws forward to grip the prey between its teeth. As with other sharks, {{the teeth of the}} leopard shark are periodically shed and replaced; it takes 9ndash&12 days for a replacement tooth to move into position. Leopard sharks have been caught with stomachs filled with clam siphons, which the sharks seize before the clams can retract and break off with a levering motion of their bodies. On occasion, the shark tears the entire clam body out of its shell this way. Other sharks examined have had stomachs containing whole innkeeper worms with no bite marks, suggesting that the sharks sucked them out of their burrows. Under a hollow bridge support in San Francisco Bay, a group of leopard sharks and spiny dogfish have been observed feeding on a dense school <b>of</b> <b>anchovies</b> by slowly swimming counterclockwise through the clockwise-swimming school, and swallowing any anchovies that accidentally entered their open mouths.|$|E

40|$|The {{role that}} {{juvenile}} anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) {{play as a}} food resource for the demersal community in the southern Bay of Biscay is assessed using 21 years <b>of</b> <b>anchovy</b> abundance data and demersal predator diets. During the study period, a total of 26 fish and elasmobranch species preyed on anchovy either frequently or occasionally. Predators with a crustacean-based diet targeted the smaller anchovy individuals. The size range <b>of</b> <b>anchovy</b> juveniles (centred at 7. 5 – 8. 9 cm) was {{comparable to that of}} the largest nektonic–benthic crustaceans, but generally smaller than other demersal and pelagic fish prey. Hake (Merluccius merluccius) and megrim (Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis) were the predators that consumed the highest number <b>of</b> <b>anchovy,</b> one <b>of</b> the main prey items driving the variability <b>of</b> their diets. <b>Anchovy</b> consumption conformed only partially to the abundance <b>of</b> <b>anchovy</b> in the southern Bay of Biscay, suggesting that factors other than abundance might condition its availability to demersal predators. Prey size could be one of them, as the size <b>of</b> the <b>anchovy</b> preyed on proved to be significantly smaller than the individuals collected with bottom trawls. However, other factors, such as the vertical position of the shoals <b>of</b> <b>anchovy</b> juveniles, could also constrain anchovy availability to demersal predators...|$|R

25|$|The diet of the {{inhabitants}} of El Paraíso consisted of a mix of domesticated and gathered resources. El Paraíso had a rather simple subsistence economy. There is a high amount of non-domesticated foods found in the archaeological record, which supports that there were sufficient resources that could be hunted or collected. Wild plants such as the roots of sedges, groundcherry and cat tails may have accounted for {{a substantial portion of}} the diet. More than 90% of their protein came from marine resources, predominantly bony fishes and molluscs. Based on minimum number of individuals (MNI) results, the bony fishes mainly consisted <b>of</b> <b>anchovies</b> and the most common molluscs were mussels. There is almost a complete absence of terrestrial fauna found at El Paraíso. The predominance of marine resources may have prevented any need for a complex agricultural subsistence economy.

40|$|Introduction: Anchovy {{sauce is}} a known appetizer in many Asian’s cuisines. Based on the bio-physical content <b>of</b> <b>anchovy</b> sauce, {{there is a}} {{possibility}} of the frequent consumption can affect severity and progression of glaucoma. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the association <b>of</b> <b>anchovy</b> sauce intake in severity and progression of glaucoma. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 91 primary glaucoma patients who were compliance and achieved target intraocular pressure, non-smoker and without a family history of glaucoma. Direct face-to-face interview on the dietary recall <b>of</b> <b>anchovy</b> sauce consumption was conducted between May 2013 and December 2013. The complete ocular examination was performed including intraocular pressure measurement. Hoddap-Parrish-Anderson criterion was used to assess the severity of glaucoma based on the latest reliable and reproducible of two consecutive Humphrey visual fields 24 - 2. The association between anchovy sauce and glaucoma severity was determined using Fisher’s exact test. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association <b>of</b> <b>anchovy</b> sauce intake with glaucoma progression. Results: A total of 46 male and 45 female with primary glaucoma were recruited with a mean age of 66. 4 (SD 10. 1) years old. 56 patients consumed anchovy sauce with 19 % occasionally, 44. 6 % weekly, 16. 1 % daily and 5. 4 % in every meal. There was no significant association <b>of</b> <b>anchovy</b> sauce intake with severity and progression of primary glaucoma after a mean of 6. 4 years <b>of</b> follow-up. Conclusion: <b>Anchovy</b> sauce has potential protective effect against progression and severity of glaucoma. However, it was not reflected in this study due to small sample size and poor quantification of the amount <b>of</b> <b>anchovy</b> sauce as a condiment to the main dish...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: pages 181 - 205. In the {{southern}} Benguela upwelling system, anchovy spawn serially between September and February each year. It {{has been suggested}} that this energy-intensive reproductive strategy requires continual ingestion of copepods, which dominate the diet <b>of</b> <b>anchovy</b> at this time. This thesis investigates the spatial and temporal variability of copepod abundance and growth, and their impact upon the spawning <b>of</b> <b>anchovy.</b> Sampling was conducted monthly between August-March 1993 / 94 and 1994 / 95 [...] It is noteworthy that the primary spawning ground <b>of</b> <b>anchovy,</b> the western Agulhas Bank, had a significantly smaller biomass of copepods than the adjacent West Coast region. In terms of the growth rates of copepods, the effect of food-limitation on fecundity and somatic growth outweighed that of temperature...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Anchovy oil {{is a very}} {{suitable}} supplementary ingredient {{for fish}} feeds due to the essential fatty acid composition. Almost all <b>of</b> <b>anchovy</b> oil produced in Turkey is used by aquatic/fish feed producers. In this research we determined fatty acids contents <b>of</b> <b>anchovy</b> oil produced in Tur-key during the commercial catching season. The total saturated fatty acids (SFA) content <b>of</b> <b>anchovy</b> oil was determined as 32. 33 %, 31. 65 %, 31. 59 % in November, December and January, respectively. Within the saturated fraction, the major fatty acid was palmitic acid (C 16 : 0) with 18. 74 %, 18. 27 %, 18. 20 % ratios during the catching season. The monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) content ranged from 23. 32 % to 24. 07 %. Concerning the MUFA, oleic acid (C 18 : 1 n- 9) constituted the larger percentage than others. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (C 22 : 6 n 3) and ei-cosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (C 20 : 5 n 3) contents <b>of</b> <b>anchovy</b> oil were found as average 15. 64 % and 9. 39 %, respectively. n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were higher than n- 6 PUFA...|$|R
