50|$|In 2008, Culberson faced his stiffest {{challenge}} {{to date in}} businessman Michael Skelly in the November 2008 election. Skelly, a former executive of Horizon Wind Energy, also served in the Peace Corps and earned an MBA from Harvard University. Skelly served on Mayor Bill White's Green Building Advisory Committee. Culberson led with 56 {{percent of the vote}} with about two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>precincts</b> <b>counted.</b> Skelly had 43 percent of the vote. This was the closest a Democratic candidate had come to winning the district since it was created in 1967.

40|$|The second {{significant}} digits of precinct-level (or polling station-level) vote counts follow regular patterns {{when voters}} are acting strategically {{and when there}} are partisan imbalances of voters in districts (when there is a gerrymander). The digits often follow distinctive patterns when vote counts are affected by coercion. The patterns are illustrated by a simulation exercise that generates individual preferences that, when aggregated into <b>precincts,</b> have <b>counts</b> whose second but not first significant digits approximately satisfy Benford’s Law (2 BL). Deriving sincere, strategic, gerrymandered and coerced votes from these preferences under a plurality voting rule shows that the second digits <b>of</b> the <b>precinct</b> <b>counts</b> are sensitive to differences in how the counts are derived. The patterns in the simulations {{are similar to those}} in real data from German Bundestag elections and from American presidential, House and state legislative elections.

50|$|This {{left only}} three {{candidates}} {{to run in}} the Democratic primary: Osborn, Sutter and Colter. On September 10, early returns showed Sutter with a slight lead over Colter.

It was felt that Osborn and Sutter split the anti-Hunt vote, which allowed Colter to win the nomination.|$|R

After his winning the nomination, his eligibility was questioned due to his involvement in the state legislature in raising the salary of the office of the governor during the prior year.

5|$|With 100 percent <b>of</b> <b>precincts</b> reporting, initial <b>counts</b> {{from the}} {{election}} had Murphy leading by about 60 votes out of over 150,000 cast. Columbia County's Board of Elections amended its tally the following day, reducing Murphy's lead to 25 votes.

By April 2, Tedisco was ahead by 12 votes. He resigned the position of Assembly Minority Leader on April 5 in preparation for a transition to Congress, and was replaced by Brian Kolb the following day. On April 7, Tedisco was ahead by 97 votes. The close tally meant that absentee ballots would decide the race.|$|R
50|$|A total <b>of</b> over 76,340 <b>precinct</b> <b>count</b> {{optical scanner}} (PCOS) machines, about 5,000 back-up units, and about 1,700 servers were {{deployed}} in the country's first nationwide fully automated elections—from counting of votes to transmission and canvassing of election results. Election day had live full coverage from GMA 7 and ABS-CBN. Besides logistical problems, {{during the last few}} days prior to the election poll machine and services supplier Smartmatic-Total Information Management (TIM) found cases of PCOS machine failures. Nonetheless, it was decided not to postpone elections since the technical issues were resolved quickly and the solution could be deployed by the day of election. Despite the fact that some provinces reported issues in the election process, these did not surpass the 0.50% {{of the total number of}} PCOS machines, and most were replaced on time, as planned for. As a result of the delays, the COMELEC extended voting hours from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. and continued through the night transmitting the votes from every precinct scattered across the country.|$|R

50|$|The {{towns in}} which the six fairs of the annual circuit were held had some {{features}} in common, but none that would have inexorably drawn the commerce of the fairs: each was situated at an intersection or former way-station of Roman roads and near a river, but only Lagny-sur-Marne had a navigable one. Troyes and Provins had been administrative centers in Charlemagne's empire that developed into the central towns of the County of Champagne and the Brie Champenoise; the fair at Bar-sur-Aube was held just outside the <b>precincts</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Count's</b> castle there, and that at Lagny in the grounds of a Benedictine monastery.

40|$|Votes in an {{election}} are often counted by machines. Winners are legally determined by what a full hand count would show. Risk-limiting election audits can help validate correct election outcomes. Moreover, when hand-count winners differ from machine-count winners, regardless {{of the source of}} the differences, these audits have a guaranteed pre-specified chance of escalating to a full hand-count thereby correcting the election outcome. Most states that have election audits require each county to independently select a random set <b>of</b> <b>precincts</b> for audit. For contests that span multiple counties, this amounts to a stratified random sample <b>of</b> <b>precincts.</b> Ballots in each audited <b>precinct</b> are <b>counted</b> by hand and differences between the hand count and the machine count are recorded.

50|$|In early 1918, Sutter {{was once}} again {{approached}} by leaders of the Democratic party to consider running in the Democratic primary for the governorship. He directly confronted the sitting governor over a dispute regarding the I.W.W., which the governor supported, and local mining operators in Bisbee, Sutter's hometown. On {{the floor of the}} legislature Sutter delivered what was considered a very impressive speech condemning the Governor's actions, and supporting the local miners. Sutter went on to successfully curtail Hunt's power to make appointments to the Arizona Council for Defense, the state body responsible for coordinating Arizona projects relating to the war effort. Hunt had been appointing liberal democrats, as he himself was one, to the board. Sutter led a movement which resulted in the number of members of the council was reduced from 50 to 14, one from each county, and any nominee by Hunt had to be approved by that county's board of supervisors. Sutter publicly announced his attention to seek the Democratic nomination in June. By the time the Democratic primary occurred, only three candidates were left: Sidney Osborn, Sutter and Fred Colter. On September 10, early returns showed Sutter with a slight lead over Colter. With only 29 <b>of</b> 82 statewide <b>precincts</b> <b>counted,</b> Sutter had 772 votes to Colter's 755, with Osborn a distant third with 71. However. by the time 79 precincts had tallied their votes, Colter had pulled into a commanding lead, with the three final <b>precincts</b> to be <b>counted</b> being small. Colter won the Democratic primary in September 1918, garnering 44% of the total votes, 14,539 to Sutter's 10,108 and Osborn's 8,390. Post-election analysis felt that the anti-Hunt faction of the party had split their vote between Osborn and Sutter allowing Colter to win the nomination. During the general election, supporters of Colter approached Sutter to request he write a public letter endorsing Colter. Sutter agreed, but with the provision that the letter also include his feelings towards Hunt and the I.W.W. issue. Not wishing the negative publicity, Colter's supporters withdrew their request.|$|R

40|$|Three {{options are}} {{explored}} for bringing Connecticut’s voting systems into compliance with two Title III {{requirements of the}} 2002 Help America Vote Act (HAVA) [1]: 1.

Each voting system used in Federal elections must produce a permanent paper record with a manual audit capacity for such system. Both of these requirements take effect January 1, 2006. The three options considered are: (1) An all-DRE system that replaces all lever machines with accessible DRE machines. (2) A mixed system that puts one accessible DRE machine in each voting district and replaces the lever machines with <b>precinct</b> <b>count</b> optical scan systems. (3) An all-optical scan system that replaces the lever machines with <b>precinct</b> <b>count</b> optical scan systems and provides accessibility through the use of ballot marking devices.
