Foreign nationals were confined throughout the war. As the regional capital Mỹ Tho is the main market dealing in all the produce from the region as well as fish and seafood from Mỹ Tho's large <b>ocean-going</b> <b>fishing</b> fleet. The very large and exuberant market is one of South Vietnam's biggest sources for dried fish and other dried seafood products such as Kho Muc (dried squid). At night the market {{is dedicated to the}} dealing and sorting of Mekong River fish, particularly catfish for Hồ Chí Minh City's wholesale markets. Produce, especially fruit and vegetables, watch, is delivered by boat directly to markets. It is a popular starting point for tourists to take a boat trip on the Mekong River.|$|E

40|$|While most {{commercial}} fisheries in the North Atlantic are strictly regulated through total allowable quotas, licenses and vessel quotas {{to limit the}} catch rates, the fishing for blue whiting represents an exception. Today, the blue whiting fishery is out of control; catch rates far exceed what the management authorities propose for a sustainable fishery {{and there is a}} real danger for collapse of the stock. The driving force in this development refers {{to the fact that the}} coastal states that are involved in the blue whiting fisheries, are not able to agree on the distribution of the migrating blue whiting stock. In Norway, the strong increase in both catch capacity and catch rates, also refers to a liberalization of the institutional framework for the renewal and design of new vessels, but also to structural politics concerning the <b>ocean-going</b> <b>fishing</b> vessels. This article presents the management conflict within the international fisheries for blue whiting and the driving forces behind the capacity increase in the Norwegian blue whiting fleet. However, a future agreement among the coastal nations within the framework of a sustainable fishery, inefficient overcapacity emerges when total quotas and allocation are put on the agenda. This results in allocation conflicts at different management levels that prevent a future solution. The question now is whether regional management organizations like the NEAFC (North East Atlantic Fisheries Committee) should have a more prominent position in the management of resources that migrate through the different coastal states' economic zones.

500|$|Tuna {{and other}} fast-swimming <b>ocean-going</b> <b>fish</b> {{maintain}} their muscles at higher temperatures than their environment for efficient locomotion. Tuna achieve muscle temperatures [...] or even higher above the surroundings {{by having a}} counterflow {{system in which the}} metabolic heat produced by the muscles and present in the venous blood, pre-warms the arterial blood before it reaches the muscles. Other adaptations of tuna for speed include a streamlined, spindle-shaped body, fins designed to reduce drag, and muscles with a raised myoglobin content, which gives these a reddish colour and makes for a more efficient use of oxygen. In polar regions and in the deep ocean, where the temperature is a few degrees above freezing point, some large fish, such as the swordfish, marlin and tuna, have a heating mechanism which raises the temperature of the brain and eye, allowing them significantly better vision than their cold-blooded prey.|$|R
5000|$|The European bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is a {{primarily}} <b>ocean-going</b> <b>fish</b> {{native to}} the waters off of Europe's western and southern and Africa's northern coasts, though {{it can also be}} found in shallow coastal waters and river mouths during the summer months. It is one of only six species in its family, Moronidae, collectively called the temperate basses.

40|$|General {{concepts}} of larval fish ecology in temperate oceans predominantly associate dispersal and survival to exogenous mechanisms such as passive drift along ocean currents. However, for tropical reef fish larvae and species in inland freshwater systems behavioural aspects of habitat selection are evidently important components of dispersal. This study {{is focused on}} larval Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) distribution in a Baltic Sea retention area, free of lunar tides and directed current regimes, considered as a natural mesocosm. A Lorenz curve originally applied in socio-economics to describe demographic income distribution was adapted to a 20 year time-series of weekly larval herring distribution, revealing size-dependent spatial homogeneity. Additional quantitative sampling of distinct larval development stages across pelagic and littoral areas uncovered a loop in habitat use during larval ontogeny, revealing a key role of shallow littoral waters. With increasing rates of coastal change, our findings {{emphasize the importance of}} the littoral zone when considering reproduction of pelagic, <b>ocean-going</b> <b>fish</b> species; highlighting a need for more sensitive management of regional coastal zones...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, ecologists have {{witnessed}} vast improvements {{in our ability}} to collect animal movement data through animal-borne technology, such as through GPS or ARGOS systems. However, more data does not necessarily yield greater knowledge in understanding animal ecology and conservation. In this paper, we provide a review of the major benefits, problems and potential misuses of GPS/Argos technology to animal ecology and conservation. Benefits are obvious, and include the ability to collect fine-scale spatio-temporal location data on many previously impossible to study animals, such as <b>ocean-going</b> <b>fish,</b> migratory songbirds and long-distance migratory mammals. These benefits come with significant problems, however, imposed by frequent collar failures and high cost, which often results in weaker study design, reduced sample sizes and poorer statistical inference. In addition, we see the divorcing of biologists from a field-based understanding of animal ecology to be a growing problem. Despite these difficulties, GPS devices have provided significant benefits, particularly in the conservation and ecology of wide-ranging species. We conclude by offering suggestions for ecologists on which kinds of ecological questions would currently benefit the most from GPS/Argos technology, and where the technology has been potentially misused. Significant conceptual challenges remain, however, including the links between movement and behaviour, and movement and population dynamics...|$|R

40|$|The upper Cowlitz {{was once}} home to native salmon and steelhead. But the {{combined}} impacts of overharvest, farming, logging and road building hammered fish runs. And in the 1960 s, {{a pair of}} hydroelectric dams blocked the migration path of ocean-returning and <b>ocean-going</b> <b>fish.</b> The lower Cowlitz still supports hatchery runs of chinook, coho and steelhead. But some 200 river miles in the upper river basin [...] much of it prime spawning and rearing habitat [...] have been virtually {{cut off from the}} ocean for over 26 years. Now the idea is to trap-and-haul salmon and steelhead both ways and bypass previously impassable obstacles in the path of anadromous fish. The plan can be summarized, for the sake of explanation, in three steps: (1) trap and haul adult fish [...] collect ocean-returning adult fish at the lowermost Cowlitz dam, and truck them upstream; (2) reseed [...] release the ripe adults above the uppermost dam, and let them spawn naturally, at the same time, supplement these runs with hatchery born fry that are reared and imprinted in ponds and net pens in the watershed; (3) trap and haul smolts [...] collection the new generation of young fish as they arrive at the uppermost Cowlitz dam, truck them past the three dams, and release them to continue their downstream migration to the sea. The critical part of any fish-collection system is the method of fish attraction. Scientists have to find the best combination of attraction system and screens that will guide young fish to the right spot, away from the turbine intakes. In the spring of 1994 a test was made of a prototype system of baffles and slots on the upriver face of the Cowlitz Falls Dam. The prototype worked at 90 % efficiency in early tests, and it worked without the kind of expensive screening devices that have been installed on other dams. Now that the success of the attraction system has been verified, Harza engineers and consultants will design and build the appropriate collection part of the system...|$|R

5000|$|Historically, the estuary gave seaborne {{access to}} castles such as Pembroke and Carew, {{allowing}} these {{to be used}} as depots in the Norman invasion of Ireland. It was important in the early Industrial Revolution, shipping anthracite from Llangwm, Landshipping and Crescelly, and limestone from Lawrenny and West Williamston. A small fishing industry operated from harbours such as Pill, Angle and Dale, but in 1790 the building of the new town of Milford commenced, and a large herring fishery grew up based on its docks. [...] In its heyday, it became the UK’s seventh largest fishing port, operating several hundred fishing trawlers, but with exhaustion of inshore fishing grounds, the docks were too small for large <b>ocean-going</b> trawlers, and <b>fishing</b> is now virtually totally non-existent. Milford was originally built for a naval dockyard, but this project was transferred in 1814 to Pembroke Dock {{on the opposite side of}} the estuary, where it operated until closure in 1926. The town of Neyland, originally known as New Milford, was also purpose-built, this time by the Great Western Railway as a transatlantic shipping terminal. Its functions were largely transferred to Fishguard in the early 20th century.|$|R
