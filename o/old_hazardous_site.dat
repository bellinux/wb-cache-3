40|$|Thesis (M. A., Sociology) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{was created}} in 1970 to {{establish}} and enforce environmental protection standards in accordance with national goals. The EPA is also charged with gathering data on pollution and determining issues of environmental justice. To {{deal with the problems}} associated with the most <b>hazardous</b> <b>sites,</b> the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), better known as the Superfund Act, was passed by Congress in 1980. While many environmental justice studies have focused on whether minorities or lower socioeconomic status populations are disproportionately affected by proximity to less <b>hazardous</b> <b>sites</b> such as facilities for the treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous wastes (TSDFs) and the siting process for such sites, Superfund sites have largely been ignored. Yet, these sites are the worst of the <b>hazardous</b> <b>sites</b> and present the greatest dangers to the populations living in proximity to them. This study will focus on the populations living near Superfund sites. Previous studies of less <b>hazardous</b> <b>sites</b> have concluded that those affected by proximity to these sites have been either minorities, of lower socioeconomic status, or both. Using census tract data, this study will examine whether race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status are factors in determining which groups are disproportionately affected by living in proximity to Superfund sites. The expectation is that minorities and persons of lower socioeconomic status are significantly more likely to live near Superfund sites. Sociolog...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAccidents {{can occur}} in both <b>hazardous</b> <b>sites</b> and during {{transportation}} of dangerous goods. Separate risk assessments for <b>hazardous</b> <b>sites</b> and dangerous goods transportation can lead to incoherent decisions that may increase global risk rather than reduce it. ''GLOBAL'' is a research project that started three {{years ago with the}} ambition of addressing the issue of dangerous goods logistics. As a result, a risk assessment approach that takes into account the risk generated by a whole supply chain of dangerous goods has been elaborated. Thus, the risks generated by the packaging, loading, storage and transportation of dangerous goods can be assessed within a unique and coherent framework. The relevance of such an approach can be justified in numerous ways. Firstly, it allows the industrial stakeholders to identify the best supply chains regarding, among other criteria, the resulting societal risks. It also makes it possible to have an homogeneous basis for land use planning regarding the risks generated by <b>hazardous</b> <b>sites</b> as well as logistics infrastructures of dangerous goods. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present the GLOBAL risk assessment approach and its scientific foundations in a first part, its limits and development perspectives in a second par...|$|R

40|$|Unequal Exposure to Ecological Hazards 2005 {{documents}} Massachusetts residents' unequal {{exposure to}} environmental hazards. More specifically, the report analyzes both income based and racially-based disparities in the geographic distribution of some 17 {{different types of}} environmentally <b>hazardous</b> <b>sites</b> and industrial facilities in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This report provides evidence that working class communities and communities of color are disproportionately impacted by toxic waste disposal, incinerators, landfills, trash transfer stations, power plants, and polluting industrial facilities. In some cases, not only are new toxic facilities and dump sites located in poorer neighborhoods and communities of color, but {{as in the case}} of the public housing development and playgrounds near the Alewife station in Cambridge, housing for people of color and low income populations is sometimes located on top of preexisting <b>hazardous</b> waste <b>sites</b> and/or nearby polluting facilities. We conclude that striking inequities in the distribution of these environmentally <b>hazardous</b> <b>sites</b> and facilities are placing working class families and people of color at substantially greater risk of exposure to human health risks.

40|$|The {{dynamic effect}} of a <b>hazardous</b> waste <b>site</b> is {{analyzed}} by investigating the causal relationship between housing appreciation rates and house location {{in relation to a}} <b>hazardous</b> waste <b>site</b> using resale data from individual sales transactions in Dallas County, Texas. The results indicate that in the period in which the <b>hazardous</b> waste <b>site</b> was identified and cleanup occurred, residential property owners in close proximity to the <b>hazardous</b> waste <b>site</b> experienced lower housing appreciation rates. In the first post-cleanup period, they gained some of the lost ground with a higher appreciation rate. In a subsequent post-cleanup period, their appreciation fell in line with property owners whose properties are located farther away from the <b>hazardous</b> waste <b>site.</b> This suggests that a long-run equilibrium has been reached since appreciation rates were not significantly different across the Dallas housing market in the second post-cleanup period. Although the results indicate that adjustment takes time, an equilibrium is eventually reached for the houses in this repeat sales data set. An important implication of our analysis is that since the post-cleanup recovery was not immediate, property owners should be compensated for their loss of liquidity...|$|R

This {{investigation}} used a two-source capture-recapture method (CRM) {{for determining}} ascertainment and undercounts of non-national priority listed <b>hazardous</b> waste <b>sites</b> {{in the states}} of Arizona, Maine and Pennsylvania. These findings suggest that ascertainment of <b>hazardous</b> waste <b>sites</b> vary greatly, with some more accurate (i. e., Maine) than others (i. e., Pennsylvania). These data suggest that nontraditional manufacturing states (e. g., Maine) have a higher ascertainment rate than traditional manufacturing states (e. g., Pennsylvania). These results indicate that resources for locating <b>hazardous</b> waste <b>sites</b> should be more heavily allotted to industrialized areas.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the first national}} study on environmental inequalities in France. It applies the Anglo-American concept of environmental justice, focusing {{on the distribution of}} environmental burdens, to the French setting and tests the hypothesis that poor and immigrant communities are disproportionately exposed to environmental risks. The location of eight types of <b>hazardous</b> <b>sites</b> (industrial and nuclear sites, incinerators, waste management facilities) and the socio-economic characteristics of populations are associated at the commune, or town, level for all 36 � 600 French towns. The analysis, descriptive and multivariate, uses simple and spatial regression techniques. It shows that towns with high proportions of immigrants tend to host more <b>hazardous</b> <b>sites,</b> even controlling for population size, income, degree of industrialization of the town and region. The study establishes the presence of environmental inequities in France and raises new public policy questions. However, it does not investigate the mechanisms that may explain inequities, which could include procedural injustices, land market dynamics and historical patterns of industrial and urban development. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the social and}} geographic distribution of ecological hazards across 368 communities in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Combining census data {{with a variety of}} environmental data, we tested for and identified both income-based and racially based biases to the geographic distribution of 17 different types of environmentally <b>hazardous</b> <b>sites</b> and industrial facilities. We also developed a composite measure of cumulative exposure to compare the relative overall risks characteristic of each community. To the best of our knowledge, this point system makes this the first environmental justice study to develop a means for measuring and ranking cumulative exposure for communities. The study also controls for the intensity of hazards in each community by accounting for the area across which hazards are distributed. The findings indicate that ecologically <b>hazardous</b> <b>sites</b> and facilities are disproportionately located and concentrated in communities of color and working-class communities. The implication of this research for policymakers and citizen advocates is that cumulative exposure of residents to environmentally <b>hazardous</b> facilities and <b>sites</b> should receive greater consideration regarding community demographics and environmental health indicators. We conclude that the provision of additional resources for environmental monitoring and ranking, as well as yearly progress reports, is necessary for communities and state agencies to achieve equal access to clean and healthy environments for all residents.
