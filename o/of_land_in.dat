5|$|According to Di Tella and Zymelman (1967), {{the main}} {{difference}} between Argentina and other settler societies such as Australia and Canada was its failure to seek adequate alternatives to compensate for the end of geographical expansion with the definitive closing of the frontier. Solberg (1985) noted the differences between the land distribution in Canada, which led to a rising number of small farmers, and the small number of landowners each with large areas <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> Argentina.|$|E

5|$|Among Harrison's most {{enduring}} legacies is {{the series of}} treaties that he either negotiated or signed with Native American leaders during his tenure as the Indiana territorial governor. As part of the treaty negotiations, the native tribes ceded large tracts <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> the west that provided additional acreage for purchase and settlement. Harrison's chief presidential legacy lies in his campaigning methods, which {{laid the foundation for}} the modern presidential campaign tactics.|$|E

5|$|Burton {{remained}} a Senator while {{each of his}} appeals were pending. Allegedly, his colleagues made it known that they would move to expel him if he appeared in the Senate.

5|$|By the 1870s, Chicago {{had become}} the main {{financial}} center for the West, but in October 1871 the Great Chicago Fire destroyed {{the majority of the}} wooden structures within city. The city was rebuilt on large plots <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> a new grid network and followed new city ordinances that prohibited construction in wood. These factors encouraged the building of taller properties in new innovative designs, which, like New York, saw a range of businesses and services being packed into single buildings.|$|E
5|$|Claimants {{from the}} line of Moana Wahine made {{petitions}} to the court under the act of 1874 to quite land titles.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{analyzed}} the interdecadal variation {{by applying the}} statistical change-point analysis to {{the frequency of the}} tropical cyclone (TC) that <b>landed</b> <b>in</b> the Korean Peninsula (KP) for the recent 54 years (1951 to 2004) and performed cluster classification of the Korea-landfall TC tracks using a Fuzzy Clustering Method (FCM). First, in the interdecadal variation analysis, frequency <b>of</b> TC that <b>landed</b> <b>in</b> the KP was largely categorized into three periods: high frequency period from 1951 to 1965, low frequency period from 1966 to 1985, and high frequency period from 1986 to 2004. The cluster analysis result of the Korea-landfall TC tracks produced the optimum number of clusters as four. In more detail, Cluster A refers to a pattern <b>of</b> <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> the southern coast in the KP starting from East China Sea followed by heading north while Cluster B refers to a pattern <b>of</b> <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> the west coast of the Korean Peninsula, also starting from East China Sea followed by heading north. Cluster C refers to a pattern <b>of</b> <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> the southern region of the west coast in the KP moving from mainland China while Cluster D refers to a pattern <b>of</b> <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> the mid-north region of the west coast in the Korean Peninsula, also moving from mainland China...|$|R

He built the Magen David Synagogue in Kolkata in 1861; this was in addition to the older Magen Hasidim synagogue. His son, Abdulla Sassoon, transformed the weaving industry in Bombay. To cater to the increasing need of the Baghdadi Jews, Knesset Eliyahoo synagogue was constructed on a premium piece <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> the hub of Bombay's commercial area by Jacob Sassoon, grandson of David Sassoon, commemorating his father, Eliyahoo Sassoon.
