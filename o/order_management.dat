40|$|The {{intent of}} this project was to design and {{evaluate}} a Graphic User Interface (GUI) that would enhance user performance compared to an existing TEXT-based system used for nursing orders. Ninety-eight nurses (48 females, 50 males) volunteered {{to participate in the}} study, which required the completion of four types of nursing orders (Activate, Change, Discontinue, and Create) using each interface. Data collection software was developed to record the time necessary to complete each assigned order and to accumulate the number of keystrokes used to complete each trial. Each participant completed 5 training trials, 4 practice trials, and 40 test trials using each interface. A three-way Interface (2) X Block (4) X Order Type (4) within group design analysis was completed. The GUI interface was significantly easier to learn and faster to use for nursing <b>orders</b> <b>management.</b> Tasks were completed using the GUI display nearly hvice as fast as the TEXT-based interface, even after substantial practice on both systems. Most importantly, using the GUI also produced significantly fewer errors than using the TEXT-based interface. It is clear that a GUI interface saves nursing time and reduces errors compared to a TEXT-based interface for nursing <b>orders</b> <b>management.</b> In fact, potentially 1 -I. 5 hours per day per nurse could be saved using- a GUI display...|$|R

30|$|Although {{reciprocity}} {{is fundamental}} to all social <b>orders,</b> <b>management</b> research offers few reviews of the concept’s theoretical origins and current applications. To help bridge this gap, we elucidate the dominant understandings of reciprocity, ask which areas of research emerge from them, and explore how they interconnect. Our bibliometric methodology detects four clusters of management research on reciprocity. Across these clusters, authors subscribe mainly to substantialist ontology, marginalize morally oriented motives consistent with relational ontology, and largely assume that benefit-oriented motives underlie reciprocity. We outline the advantages of a moral-oriented relationalist concept of reciprocity and discuss potential areas for its development in management research.|$|R
