It was further uprated to 2.0litres as the season progressed. For the P261's 1967 trip to the Antipodes the engine capacity was stretched yet further, providing the ultimate [...] version, which also saw service in a few Formula One races later in the year. In an attempt to keep the P261 competitive into 1968, the fifth chassis was fitted with the new, 3-litre V12 BRM engine, but without success.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Oversquare</b> engines (a.k.a. [...] "short stroke engines") {{are very}} common, as they allow higher rpm (and thus more power), without {{excessive}} piston speed.|$|E
5000|$|Horizontally opposed, {{also known}} as [...] "Boxer" [...] or [...] "flat", engines {{typically}} feature <b>oversquare</b> designs since any increase in stroke length would result in twice the increase in overall engine width. This is particularly so in Subaru's front-engine layout, where the steering angle of the front wheels is constrained by {{the width of the}} engine. Although <b>oversquare</b> engines have a reputation for being high-strung, [...] low-torque machines, the Subaru EJ181 engine develops peak torque at speeds as low as 3200 rpm.|$|E
50|$|Tresilian {{designed}} an <b>oversquare</b> twin-cam 2.5-litre four-cylinder for the BRM P25 Formula One car. Tresilian subsequently {{designed the}} BRM P48, BRM's first rear-engined Formula One car.|$|E

50|$|The 2.0 L (1995 cc) was an <b>oversquare</b> {{design with}} a single belt driven {{overhead}} camshaft, an 88 mm (3.5 in) bore, and an 82 mm (3.2 in) stroke.|$|E
50|$|The reduced {{stroke length}} {{allows for a}} shorter {{cylinder}} and sometimes a shorter connecting rod, generally making <b>oversquare</b> engines less tall but wider than undersquare engines of similar engine displacement.|$|E
50|$|The EN05 was {{the first}} engine in the EN series. Variants include a {{naturally}} aspirated model with a carburetor, and the EMPi equipped with a supercharger. Cylinder dimensions are slightly <b>oversquare.</b>|$|E

50|$|Large {{increases}} in stroke can decrease an engine's {{ability to perform}} optimally at high rpm. Engines used at sustained high rpm usually will be better with less stroke and more bore (<b>oversquare).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Ducati Panigale {{motorcycle}} {{engine is}} massively <b>oversquare</b> with a bore/stroke ratio of 1.84:1. It {{was given the}} name [...] "SuperQuadro" [...] by Ducati, roughly translated as [...] "super-square" [...] from Italian.|$|E

5000|$|The Giulietta was {{launched}} in November 1977. Two models were available: Giulietta 1.3, with an <b>oversquare</b> [...] 1357 cc engine, and Giulietta 1.6, with a [...] 1570 cc engine, both Alfa Romeo Twin Cam inline-fours fed by two twin-choke carburettors.|$|E
50|$|Extreme <b>oversquare</b> {{engines are}} found in Formula One racing cars, where strict rules limit displacement, thereby necessitating that power be {{achieved}} through high engine speeds. Stroke ratios approaching 2.5:1 are allowed, enabling engine speeds of 18,000 RPM while remaining reliable for multiple races.|$|E
50|$|The M102 {{engine family}} was a straight-4 {{gasoline}} automobile engine from Mercedes-Benz in the 1980s and early 1990s. It {{is a relatively}} <b>oversquare</b> engine with a large bore and short stroke. Compare to the M115 engine which was used {{during the same time}} frame.|$|E
50|$|The new Superquadro {{engine is}} {{exceptionally}} <b>oversquare,</b> with a bore:stroke ratio of 1.84:1. Whereas previous Ducatis had belt-driven overhead cams, this engine's valvetrain uses gears and chain. The engine {{serves as a}} stressed member, making the Panigale smaller and lighter than a conventionally framed motorcycle.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>oversquare</b> engine {{allows for}} more and larger valves in {{the head of the}} cylinder, higher {{possible}} RPM by lowering maximum piston ring speed and lower crank stress due to the lower peak piston acceleration for the same engine speed. Due to the increased piston and head surface area, the heat loss increases as the bore/stroke ratio is increased. Thus an excessively high ratio can lead to a decreased thermal efficiency compared to other engine geometries. Because these characteristics favor higher engine speeds, <b>oversquare</b> engines are often tuned to develop peak torque at a relatively high speed. The large size/width of the combustion chamber at ignition can cause increased inhomogeneity in the air/fuel mixture during combustion, resulting in higher emissions.|$|E
5000|$|The G-18 was a 1.8 L (1815 cc/110 in³) variant. Its 85 mm bore was {{the largest}} in the range, and the 80 mm stroke gave it good <b>oversquare</b> dimensions. It was an SOHC cross flow {{cylinder}} head design like the G-15 and produced [...] and 115 lbft Nm.|$|E
50|$|The M111 {{engine family}} is a straight-4 {{automobile}} engine from Mercedes-Benz, produced from 1992 to 2003. Debuted in the 1992 Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W124), this engine family is relatively <b>oversquare</b> and uses 4 valves per cylinder. All engines in the family use a cast iron engine block and aluminum alloy cylinder head.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "square engine" [...] is {{an engine}} with a bore {{diameter}} equal to its stroke length. An engine where the bore diameter {{is larger than}} its stroke length is an <b>oversquare</b> engine, conversely, an engine with a bore diameter that is smaller than its stroke length is an undersquare engine.|$|E
50|$|While {{most modern}} {{motorcycle}} engines are square or <b>oversquare,</b> some are undersquare. The Kawasaki Z1300's straight-six engine was made undersquare to minimise engine width, more recently, a new straight-twin engine for the Honda NC700 series used an undersquare design to achieve better combustion efficiency {{in order to}} reduce fuel consumption.|$|E
5000|$|The 2.0 L (1991 cc) 2000 {{version was}} the {{ultimate}} Flavia engine. Bore was 89 mm and stroke was 80 mm for a good <b>oversquare</b> ratio. In 1971, the 2.0 L produced , and in the HF Coupe in 1972 it produced [...] This engine was produced from 1968 through 1974.|$|E
5000|$|Undersquare {{engines are}} {{typically}} tuned to exhibit peak torque at lower RPM than an <b>oversquare</b> engine {{due to their}} longer crank throw and high piston speed at high RPM. While the surface area of the cylinder in an undersquare engine may be {{higher than that of}} a square engine cylinder, heat exchange through the cylinder wall is lessened compared to heat exchange through the cylinder head and piston since the cylinder wall is not in constant contact with the expanding gasses. Since each unit of area of cylinder wall permits less heat loss to the engine than through the cylinder head or piston, undersquare engines generally exhibit improved thermal efficiency compared to <b>oversquare</b> engines. For these reasons, diesel truck engines which require low RPM torque and high thermal efficiency more than high power density most commonly adopt an undersquare engine geometry.|$|E
50|$|The 1071 cc {{version was}} another one-off, {{this time for}} the Mini Cooper S. It used a new 70.6 mm bore size and the 68.26 mm stroke from the 848. It was only {{produced}} in 1963-1964. Paired with the even rarer 970 cc version, below, it became that rarest of things: an <b>oversquare</b> A-series engine.|$|E
50|$|The {{situation}} persisted {{for several}} generations of four- and six-cylinder British engines: for example, Jaguar's 3.4-litre XK engine of the 1950s had six cylinders with a bore of 83 mm and a stroke of 106 mm, where most American automakers had long since moved to <b>oversquare</b> (large bore, short stroke) V-8s (see, for example, the early Chrysler Hemi).|$|E
50|$|The engine {{had three}} {{horizontal}} cylinders, the outer {{two of which}} were power cylinders and the centre cylinder used as a scavenging pump. Each power cylinder contained two slightly <b>oversquare</b> opposed pistons with uniflow piston-porting. Unusually for a small two-stroke, there was no reliance on the Kadenacy effect. The transfer ports though were angle-drilled to encourage swirl.|$|E
50|$|This {{new engine}} was a {{water-cooled}} V-12 with a 50° angle between the banks. Ideal balance usually favours an angle of 60°, but this choice made the engine narrower overall. Cylinder bore was 140 mm and stroke was 130 mm, for {{a capacity of}} 24.02 litres. This <b>oversquare</b> geometry was a first for Sunbeam, but encouraged a high-revving and thus more powerful engine.|$|E
50|$|The 1956 Opel Kapitän was {{the next}} vehicle from the company with a straight-6 engine. This was a 2605 cc unit with 12 {{overhead}} valves. Bore and stroke were now <b>oversquare</b> for high power output at 85.0 mm (3.3 in) by 76.5 mm (3 in). A single Opel-designed carburetor and 7.8:1 compression yielded 91 PS (90 hp/67 kW) and 186 N·m (137 lb·ft).|$|E
5000|$|In roadgoing trim,the 2.3 L 16-valve engine made [...] " [...] at 6,200 rpm and 174 lbft Nm at 4,500 rpm. The <b>oversquare</b> 95.50 x 80.25 mm bore {{and stroke}} {{dimensions}} ensuring that it revs easily up to the 7000 rpm redline". Acceleration from 0-100 km/h (62 mph) was less than eight seconds, and the top speed was 230 km/h (143 mph).|$|E
50|$|While the Rekord B {{consisted}} {{of only a}} mild facelift compared to the A, it received Opel's new, more <b>oversquare</b> four-cylinder CIH (cam in head) engines (1500, 1700 S, 1900 S). The CIH engines were used in all subsequent Rekord generations until 1986, when Rekord {{was replaced by the}} Opel Omega. The 2,600 cc six-cylinder engine remained unchanged. The line-up was identical to the Rekord A.|$|E
