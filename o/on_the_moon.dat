5|$|Hergé had {{developed}} {{the idea of}} setting an Adventure of Tintin <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> while producing Prisoners of the Sun.

In September 1950, Hergé broke off the story, feeling the need for a break from work, having fallen back into clinical depression. He and Germaine went on holiday to Gland before returning to Brussels in late September. Many readers sent letters to Tintin asking why Explorers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> was no longer being serialised, with a rumour emerging that Hergé had died. Explorers of the Moon would resume after an eighteen month hiatus, returning in April 1952.|$|E

5|$|When Shea {{was hired}} by NASA, President John F. Kennedy's {{commitment}} to landing men <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> was still only seven months old, {{and many of the}} major decisions that shaped the Apollo program were yet to be made. Foremost among these was the mode that NASA would use to land <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon.</b> When Shea first began to consider the issue in 1962, most NASA engineers and managersincluding Wernher von Braun, the director of the Marshall Space Flight Centerfavored either an approach called direct ascent, where the Apollo spacecraft would land <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> and return to the Earth as one unit, or Earth orbit rendezvous, where the spacecraft would be assembled while still in orbit around the Earth. However, dissenters such as John Houbolt, a Langley engineer, favored an approach that was then considered to be more risky: lunar orbit rendezvous, in which two spacecraft would be used. A command/service module (CSM) would remain in orbit around the Moon, while a lunar module would land <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> and return to dock with the CSM in lunar orbit, then be discarded.|$|E

5|$|Cernan {{turned down}} the {{opportunity}} to walk <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> as Lunar Module Pilot of Apollo 16, preferring to risk missing a flight altogether {{for the opportunity to}} command his own mission. After the cancellation of Apollo 18, NASA decided to send a scientist, Harrison Schmitt, to the Moon. This decision meant the original Lunar Module (LM) pilot, Joe Engle, never had the opportunity to walk <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon.</b> Cernan fought to keep his crew together; however, public pressure from the scientific community cemented Schmitt's position on the crew. Even though Cernan wanted to keep his crew together, he had a positive evaluation of Schmitt's abilities. For example, he believed Schmitt was an outstanding LM pilot and that Engle was merely an adequate one.|$|E
