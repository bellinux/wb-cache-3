40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between the proposed Common European Sales Law (CESL) and <b>mandatory</b> <b>provisions</b> of national law. It is argued that the embedding of this optional sales regime in the conflict of laws makes the application of <b>mandatory</b> <b>provisions</b> inevitable. In particular the application of <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> <b>provisions</b> might disturb the planned operation of CESL and render the desired harmonisation illusory. This should be taken as a reason to rethink the overly broad definition of <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> <b>provisions</b> under the Rome I Regulation and rationalise this intruder into the conflict of laws system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract__ The Rome I Regulation {{on the law}} {{applicable}} to contractual obligations contains several provisions aimed explicitly at the protection of ‘weaker’ contracting parties, such as consumers and employees. However, in addition to this, the interests of weaker parties are sometimes also safeguarded {{through the application of}} ‘overriding mandatory provisions’, which are superimposed on the law {{applicable to}} the contract to protect a fundamental interest of a Member State. This article is an attempt to clarify {{the extent to which the}} concept of <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> <b>provisions</b> may serve as a vehicle for weaker party protection. To do this, it examines the definition and limitations of the concept and its relation to conflict of laws rules based on the protective principle. Finally, the article seeks to establish whether the doctrine of <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> <b>provisions</b> remains relevant in the case of harmonisation of substantive law at the EU level, for which it will differentiate between full and minimum harmonisation...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} of the proposed Common European Sales Law (CESL) and the rules on <b>mandatory</b> and <b>overriding</b> <b>provisions</b> in private international law. The author argues that the CESL will not achieve its stated aim of taking precedence over these provisions of national law and therefore not lead to an increase in cross-border trade. It is pointed out how slight changes in drafting can overcome the collision with <b>mandatory</b> <b>provisions.</b> The clash with <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> <b>provisions,</b> the author argues, should be taken as an opportunity to rethink the definition of these provisions...|$|R

It provides as follows: 1. These Principles shall not prevent a court from applying <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> <b>provisions</b> of the law of the forum which apply irrespective of the law chosen by the parties. 2. The law of the forum determines when a court may or must apply or take into account <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> <b>provisions</b> of another law. 3. A court may exclude application of a provision of the law chosen by the parties only if {{and to the extent that}} the result of such application would be manifestly incompatible with fundamental notions of public policy (ordre public) of the forum. 4. The law of the forum determines when a court may or must apply or take into account the public policy (ordre public) of a State the law of which would be applicable in the absence of a choice of law. 5. These Principles shall not prevent an arbitral tribunal from applying or taking into account public policy (ordre public), or from applying or taking into account <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> <b>provisions</b> of a law other than the law chosen by the parties, if the arbitral tribunal is required or entitled to do so. In brief summary, therefore, the first and third paragraphs address the relationship between the chosen law and certain laws and policies of the forum, the second paragraph addresses the relationship between the chosen law and certain laws of legal systems other than the forum, the fourth paragraph addresses the relationship between the chosen law and the certain policies of the legal system whose laws would have applied but for the parties’ choice under Art. 2 (1) and the fifth paragraph addresses the limits of the application of the chosen law in arbitration proceedings. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{mobility}} of posted workers both within the EU and at an international level. From the first point of view a fundamental role is played by the p. i. l. rules on the applicable law contained {{not only in the}} Rome I Regulation but also in the Directive No. 96 / 71 on posted workers. The latter, in particular, integrates the p. i. l. rules by establishing a core of <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> <b>provisions</b> aimed at guaranteeing a minimum level of protection to posted workers. In the free trade and investment agreements concluded by the EU, on the contrary, p. i. l. provisions are absent and the only tool that can be referred to in order to ensure workers the highest protection possible is a dynamic interpretation of the social chapters of new generation contained in such agreements {{in the light of the}} ILO core labour standards...|$|R

40|$|European Union Law and Private International Law both {{attempt to}} resolve a {{conflict}} of laws. There is however a certain {{tension between the two}} disciplines. The present book proposes suggestions to enhance their mutual understanding. The Rome I Regulation on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations has unified the conflict of laws rules of the Member States. The influence of the European Union upon Private International Law goes however beyond positive harmonisation. There is a certain tension between European law and PIL. European law is concerned with whether the imposition of a rule constitutes a restriction to the internal market whereas PIL does not seek to neutralise the disadvantages that result from differences between national laws but instead tries to locate the geographical centre of the legal relationship. The present book attempts to identify the methodological disharmony between the two legal disciplines in the regulation of cross border contracts and proposes suggestions to enhance their mutual understanding.

40|$|Peremptory {{rules in}} {{international}} business transactions The topic of this diploma thesis covers {{the issue of}} peremptory or rather <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> rules in international business transactions. <b>Overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> rules are rules which shall apply despite the choice of law made by the parties of the contract. These rules, which are usually of a public nature, serve to implement some crucial public interests and may have important impacts on business relationships. The objective of this thesis is to, firstly, characterize <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> rules and secondly, to analyze the system of regulation of foreign trade with certain specific kinds of goods, where these rules are typically to be found. This thesis is divided into 12 chapters and also includes a general introduction and a final conclusion. The first chapters aim to provide a complex definition of <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> rules including one on what distinguishes these rules from public policy. The process of application of these rules based on their origin is examined in detail. The closest attention {{is given to the}} process of applying these rules when {{they are part of the}} law of a third country. The following chapters then focus on an area of law of which the use of <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> rules is characteristic., i. e. the regulation of [...] ...|$|R

40|$|LL. M. (International Commercial Law) Abstract: Due to {{globalization}} consumers nowadays readily {{enter into}} cross-border transactions, {{and it is}} therefore almost universally acknowledged that these transactions will be governed by the law chosen by the parties, albeit that {{this may not be}} the domestic law of the consumer’s home country. Choice-of-law agreement is an incidence of the doctrine of party autonomy, and in the field of private international law the latter gives expression to the principle of freedom of contract. Party autonomy allows the parties to select the law that will govern their contract, but it is not unrestricted, and is limited to protect the consumer. This is done by, for example the application of <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> statutes. If the consumer legislation in Australia and South Africa are <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> statutes, Australian and South African consumers will be protected. The Australian Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) Schedule 2, commonly referred to as the Australian Consumer Law, is an <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> statute, and cannot be excluded by the foreign law chosen by the parties in consumer contracts falling within the ambit of the Australian Consumer Law. The South African Consumer Act 68 of 2008 is not an <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> statute, but nonetheless protects South African consumers if the consumer contract falls within the ambit of the Consumer Protection Act. This is done by either curtailing the effects of party choice-of-law agreement by preferring the law (whether the chosen foreign law or the domestic law of the consumer’s home country) providing greater protection to the consumer as compared to the other, or by disallowing the parties from waiving the statutory protective measures in the Consumer Protection Act. In Australia and in South Africa both natural persons and, in certain instances juristic persons are protected by the Australian Consumer Law and the Consumer Protection Act, respectively, thus taking the field of consumer protection into the commercial sphere...|$|R

The special emphasis is given to <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> rules, the importance and impacts of these rules of law on civil and commercial relations with international element. This thesis is composed of four parts {{and each of them}} is subdivided into further sections and paragraphs. In the first part, we introduce the general theory as theoretical base of the subject and we define the key terms. The question concerning the role of Czech courts in the application of foreign law is also mentioned. Subsequently, we analyze national Czech legislation and we focus on the relevant provisions contained in the draft of new Private International Law Act. By becoming Member State of the European Union in 2004, Czech Republic undertook to accede to the 1980 Rome Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations. Second chapter is dedicated to this international treaty which has clarified the concept of "mandatory rules" but has also given rise to some qualification problems.
