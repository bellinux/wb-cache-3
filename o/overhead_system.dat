25|$|At its {{inception}} Line 12 operated four-motor Sprague-Thomson trains, equipped with 600 volt pantographs and scrubbers, the <b>overhead</b> <b>system</b> which supplies the trains with electricity. After {{the integration of}} the line into the CMP network, the overhead lines and pantographs were removed. The trains remained unique, using a grey and blue colour scheme for the 2nd class cars and red and yellow for 1st class until 1972.|$|E
25|$|The LBSCR scheme, {{authorised}} in 1903, pioneered main-line rail electrification in the UK, and {{the first}} electric train ran on 1 December 1909. For the following three years, steam trains alternated with electrics, the latter operating every 15 minutes from 7.30am to midnight. Passenger numbers had fallen on introducing electric tramways in South London by 1.25million in six months. In {{the first year of}} the rival line's electric operation passengers increased from 4million to 7.5million. The electrification used the <b>overhead</b> <b>system</b> at 6700 V AC, supplied by a power station at Deptford. After creation of the Big Four railway companies, the Southern Railway installed standard third-rail 660 V DC supply on 17 June 1928.|$|E
25|$|Melbourne's tram system {{operates}} on 600 volt DC electricity, {{provided to the}} over head lines by a network of 50 substations spread across the network. Electricity is supplied to these substations in either 6,600, 11,000, or 22,000 volt AC and is then stepped down, and rectified to 600 volt DC. The <b>overhead</b> <b>system</b> is further separated into 100 sections, this is done for two reasons, one is to maintain voltage and current across the network, and two is to isolate disruptions when issues relating to the electrical transmission system occur. The most common disturbances to the supply system are over height vehicles, falling tree limbs, damaged poles, and fires nearby to overhead wires.|$|E

In addition, total <b>system</b> <b>overhead</b> is also measured. A methodology, which estimates the MP overhead present in real workloads, is illustrated with real measurents. It is found that MP overhead usually consumes between 10 and 23 percent of the processing power available to parallel programs. The mean MP overhead is determined to be 16 percent which is well over half the total <b>system</b> <b>overhead</b> executed on the system (the mean <b>system</b> <b>overhead</b> is determined to be 24 percent of the processing power).

25|$|The {{original}} Thameslink {{rail network}} {{was created by}} joining the electrified network south of the Thames with the then recently electrified line between Bedford and St Pancras to the north via the Snow Hill tunnel, allowing passengers to travel between stations {{to the north and}} south of London, including Bedford, Luton Airport, Gatwick Airport and Brighton, without changing trains or using the London Underground. New dual-voltage rolling stock was required for the service on account of differing electrification standards north and south of London; lines south of the river are electrified using a 750-volt third rail and those to the north by the more modern 25kV <b>overhead</b> <b>system.</b> Services began in 1988 and the route was fully inaugurated in May 1990.|$|E
25|$|All {{units were}} formed of four cars. When {{originally}} built, units were numbered {{in the range}} 01s-32s, and were composed of two outer driving trailers, an intermediate trailer composite (i.e. with some first-class seating), and an intermediate motor brake. The units were constructed to operate off the 1,500 V direct current (DC) overhead power system used on Eastern Region suburban lines. However, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, these lines were converted to the 6.25 kV/25 kV alternating current (AC) <b>overhead</b> <b>system,</b> which was adopted as standard, and coincided {{with the introduction of}} new Class 302 (AM2) units. Therefore, from 1960-1962 the entire AM7 fleet was extensively rebuilt at Eastleigh Works to allow units to operate from the new voltage system. The work including moving the guard's compartment from the motor coach to one of the driving trailers. At the same time, units were renumbered into the range 101-132.|$|E

With water and labor perennial concerns in California, the suitability of <b>overhead</b> <b>systems</b> merits consideration. From 2008 through 2013, in studies near Five Points, California, we evaluated overhead irrigation for wheat, corn, cotton, tomato, onion and broccoli as an alternative to furrow and drip irrigation. With the exception of tomato, equal or increased yields were achieved with overhead irrigation. Many variables are involved in the choice of an irrigation system, but our results suggest that, with more research to support best management practices, overhead irrigation may be useful to a wider set of California farmers than currently use it. ...|$|R
