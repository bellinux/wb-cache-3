5|$|Colleagues have testified that, {{far from}} feeling bound or stifled by the Whiteman orchestra, as Green {{and others have}} suggested, Bix often {{felt a sense of}} exhilaration. It was like {{attending}} a music school, learning and broadening: formal music, especially the synthesis of the American vernacular idiom with a more classical orientation, so much sought-after in the 1920s, were calling <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} novels in the series, aspects of Thunderball come from Fleming's own experiences: the visit to the health clinic was inspired by his own 1955 trip to the Enton Hall health farm and Bond's medical record, as read <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> by M, is a slightly modified version of Fleming's own. The name of the health farm, Shrublands, was taken {{from that of a}} house owned by the parents of his wife's friend, Peter Quennell. Fleming dedicates a quarter of the novel to the Shrublands setting and the naturalist cure Bond undergoes.|$|E
5|$|Besides Big K.R.I.T. and Ashthon Jones, {{the album}} also {{features}} appearances by The Voice finalist Mathai, Mali Music, and Reach Records artists Trip Lee and Tedashii.

In an interview with AllHipHop, Lecrae mentioned that both he and Big K.R.I.T. have similar backgrounds, having both {{grown up in the}} Southern United States and struggled with religion under the influence of a religious grandmother.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, {{members of}} the Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit {{conducted}} a measured survey of the monument. In 2005, Ashbee noted {{that he had found}} evidence of recent metal detectoring activity at the site. On 15 May 2007, the Kentish archaeologist Brian Philp was conducting his regular inspection of the monument when the property owner, Mrs Bygrave, pointed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> an area where the road was beginning to subside. He alerted Kent County Council, who organised for contractors to investigate the reason for the subsidence, which proved to be decades of rabbit burrowing beneath the tarmac. Archaeologists from Kent Archaeological Unit visited the site during the work, discovering a buried sarsen; comparison with older records revealed that this stone had once been upright but had been buried where it stood in the 19th century by workmen who were replacing the trackway with a paved road.|$|E

25|$|Upon arrest, Acremant {{confessed to}} the Ellis and Abdill murders, {{claiming}} that his motive was robbery.

Although Andrew Carnegie advised her to sell <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> she refused and retained ownership in businesses which led to rapid rises in her personal wealth {{over the next several}} decades.|$|E
25|$|Huang Gai {{was hit by}} a stray arrow {{during the}} battle and fell into the river.

With tears in his eyes, Han Dang helped Huang Gai remove his clothing so that the wound can be treated, and Huang survived.|$|E
25|$|Payton is {{well known}} for his trash-talk. His {{trademark}} open-mouth, bobbing-head style on the court (combined with his 17 years in the league) led to Payton receiving the third-most technical fouls of all time (behind Jerry Sloan and Rasheed Wallace). This, along with other factors, earned Payton a reputation as a difficult, volatile, and somewhat egotistical presence in the locker room, which was further fueled by various fines and suspensions handed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> by team management during Payton's last few years in Seattle.|$|E

Narayanan {{became the first}} sitting President to vote (16 February 1998), casting his vote at a polling booth in a school within the Rashtrapati Bhavan complex after standing in a queue like an ordinary citizen. He insisted on casting his vote, despite the departure from precedent being pointed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Narayanan sought to change what was a long-standing practice of Indian presidents not voting during general elections. He also exercised his franchise as President in the 1999 general elections.|$|E
25|$|On 2 September 1951, UN {{offensive}} {{operations in}} the vicinity of the Punchbowl kicked off. Despite his parent X Corps being supported by two-thirds of the CAS sorties flown, Marine General Gerald C. Thomas believed his 1st Division was shortchanged. On 2 October, he complained and claimed his division needed 40 of the 96 sorties of CAS allocated every day. It was pointed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that when Marine pilots checked in with the JOC that they were forwarded to support Marine ground units as much as possible, and that he received on-call support from Air Force sorties.|$|E

25|$|The sale of {{the team}} to a large {{corporation}} drew the ire of Colorado U.S. Senator Edwin C. Johnson, who introduced {{a bill that would}} have exempted teams owned by beer or liquor manufacturers from the antitrust exemption granted to Major League Baseball by the Supreme Court. He argued that Busch had bought the team solely to sell beer, and that as a result other companies would have to buy baseball teams to remain competitive, leading to monopolies in both businesses. When it was pointed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that no one had objected to brewer Jacob Ruppert's ownership of the New York Yankees, he responded that Ruppert had always kept both businesses separate.|$|E
25|$|The ensuing trial {{saw more}} than forty {{witnesses}} testify against Šakić. His defense lawyers asked that he be acquitted; they claimed that the prosecution had failed to prove his guilt and stated that Šakić was merely obeying orders while serving at the camp. On 4 October 1998, Šakić {{was found guilty of}} war crimes and crimes against humanity and sentenced to twenty years in prison. Šakić applauded mockingly as the guilty verdict was read <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> The presiding judge confirmed that Šakić had personally shot prisoners and had overseen the hanging of at least twenty inmates.
