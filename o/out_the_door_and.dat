5|$|After {{destroying}} his workshop, Hoffman is {{attacked and}} subdued by three pig-masked figures, {{one of whom}} is Lawrence. Flashbacks show that John Kramer found him unconscious by the steam pipe and nursed him back to health, and Lawrence has assisted him ever since. This was known only by Jill, who delivered a package to him at the hospital, a videotape in which John asked him to watch over Jill and take action if anything happened to her. To this end, Lawrence has Hoffman brought to the disused bathroom and shackled by the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence appears, throws the hacksaw he used to sever his own foot <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> then turns off the lights and seals the door, leaving Hoffman to die.|$|E

She pleads with him, telling him she realizes now that she has loved him all along and that she never really loved Ashley, but Rhett says that with Bonnie's death went any chance of reconciliation. Scarlett begs him to stay but Rhett rebuffs her and walks <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> into the early morning fog, leaving her weeping on the staircase and vowing to one day win back his love.|$|E
5|$|The same day, Mary Margaret (Goodwin) rushes <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> gives Emma {{an excuse}} {{that she has}} to make a volcano. In truth she has been going to Granny's at 7:15 every morning to see David (Dallas) getting coffee for himself and Kathryn (Griffith). Emma, who can always spot a lie, follows Mary Margaret to call out her {{stalking}} behavior and suggests she stop seeing him.

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E
25|$|Lisa shows Homer {{her school}} science project, a robot named Linguo, who corrects grammar. Homer breaks it by pouring beer down its throat, and Lisa runs upstairs frustrated. Meanwhile, Marge accidentally severs Homer's thumb {{as she is}} cutting brownies. They drive to the hospital, but Dr. Hibbert claims that the {{insurance}} will not cover the cost, so they instead drive off for Dr. Nick's clinic. Since Homer's thumb is starting to shrivel up, he stops by at Moe's, where he gets a pickle brine solution. He gets distracted when Moe offers him a beer. Homer rushes <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> sees Marge is gone. He hitchhikes with Cletus who drives him to Dr. Nick's, but they discover the clinic is on fire. Homer asks Cletus to drive him to Shelbyville Hospital, but his truck gets stolen and Homer leaves for the hospital on foot. His thumb is almost completely shrivelled up now, and he is just about to throw it away when an explosion sends Linguo's severed head flying {{up into the air}} and it lands next to him.|$|E

And {{literally}} we came <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> it was like just hundreds of people sort of coming around us. People everywhere, cameras, people yelling her name. It was incredible, I have never experienced anything like that. It was really reportage, loose, not planned, we went with feeling, we went with instinct... It's a beautiful cycle of energy." ...|$|E

2500|$|In many of {{his more}} humorous essays, Dijkstra {{described}} a fictional company of which he served as chairman. The company was called Mathematics, Inc., a company that he imagined having commercialized the production of mathematical theorems {{in the same way}} that software companies had commercialized the production of computer programs. [...] He invented a number of activities and challenges of Mathematics Inc. and documented them in several papers in the EWD series. The imaginary company had produced a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis but then had great difficulties collecting royalties from mathematicians who had proved results assuming the Riemann Hypothesis. The proof itself was a trade secret. Many of the company's proofs were rushed <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> then much of the company's effort had to be spent on maintenance. A more successful effort was the Standard Proof for Pythagoras' Theorem, that replaced the more than 100 incompatible existing proofs. Dijkstra described Mathematics Inc. as [...] "the most exciting and most miserable business ever conceived". EWD 443 (1974) describes his fictional company as having over 75 percent of the world's market share.|$|E
2500|$|In 1937, {{there were}} reports of quirky events. Louis Garrison, owner of the farm that {{included}} the Bell Witch Cave, heard unexplained noises coming from inside. Bell descendants described the sound of something rubbing against a house, a paper like object that flew <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> reentered through a side door, and faint music heard from a piano. A group from the local Epworth League were reported to have attended a wiener roast in a rock quarry near the Bell Witch Cave on July 29, 1937. The group were joking about the legend when they saw a figure of a woman sitting on top of the cliff over the cave causing many to flee. According to the newspaper, a minister in the group later claimed to have investigated and discovered it was moon light on a rock. The second report concluded with a weather report that the moon was barely noticeable that night. Jim Brooks published in 2015 that his mother was in attendance at the roast, and relates that the minister caught up to the youth on the road to town after discovering no explanation for the figure.|$|E

60|$|Gulden {{backed away}} stolidly, {{apparently}} dazed {{by his own}} movements; then he plunged <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> the ruffians who had given silent but sure expression of their loyalty tramped after him.|$|E
6000|$|Paula drooped, {{and sighed}} inaudibly, and, {{as she went}} down the room and <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> as Bonbright stepped eagerly forward with the telegrams, {{she could hear the}} {{beginning}} of her husband's conversation: ...|$|E

60|$|He went <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> {{across the}} field, empty handed. There {{were a lot}} of them {{standing}} around, gathered together, waiting. They expected a good fight; they knew he had something. They had heard about the incident at the fountain.|$|E
60|$|There was a stir {{behind the}} {{partition}} and {{a sound of}} chairs scraping the floor. Patsy slid <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> flew down the stairs at the imminent danger of breaking her neck. James was seated in the buggy outside, engaged in rumination.|$|E

60|$|And she {{proceeded}} {{to prepare the}} meal. The ladies rose; they seemed about to withdraw to the parlour. Till this moment, I had been so intent on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it recurred to me. More desolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from contrast. And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this house with concern on my behalf; to make them believe in the truth of my wants and woes--to induce them to vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings! As I groped <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> knocked at it hesitatingly, I felt that last idea to be a mere chimera. Hannah opened.|$|E
