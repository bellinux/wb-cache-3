25|$|When {{there is}} a high {{temperature}} differential (e.g., when an air-source heat pump is used to heat a house with an <b>outside</b> <b>temperature</b> of, say, 0°C (32°F)), it takes more work to move the same amount of heat to indoors than on a milder day. Ultimately, due to Carnot efficiency limits, the heat pump's performance will decrease as the outdoor-to-indoor temperature difference increases (<b>outside</b> <b>temperature</b> gets colder), reaching a theoretical limit of 1.0 at −273°C. In practice, a COP of 1.0 will typically be reached at an outdoor temperature around −18°C (0°F) for air source heat pumps.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} endeavours {{to investigate}} the nature {{and the extent of}} the emotional responses elicited to same colour, and music under two different <b>outside</b> environment <b>temperatures</b> called hot and mild. To analyse the emotional responses elicited to colour and music under hot and mild <b>outside</b> environment <b>temperatures,</b> data were collected from two clusters of sample where each consisted of 50 respondents. One cluster of sample represented customers of a supermarket where its <b>outside</b> environment <b>temperature</b> is hot and other cluster of the sample consisted of customers of a supermarket where its <b>outside</b> environment <b>temperature</b> is mild. The study found that when <b>outside</b> environment <b>temperature</b> changes, customers exhibit different emotional responses to same colour, and music. It was found that a warm colour, red produces positive emo-tional responses under mild <b>outside</b> environment <b>temperature</b> while in contrast, the same colour produces negative emotional responses under hot <b>outside</b> environment <b>temperature.</b> Moreover, it was recognized that fast-tempo music is capable of evoking positive emotional responses under mild <b>outside</b> environment <b>temperature</b> whilst evoking negative emotional responses under hot <b>outside</b> environment <b>temperature.</b> Ul-timately, the results proved that the extent {{and the nature of the}} emotional responses elicited to same co-lour, and music are different between hot <b>outside</b> environment <b>temperature</b> and mild <b>outside</b> environmen...|$|R

25|$|Migratory Lepidoptera are, in most cases, {{excellent}} flyers. Species {{like the}} Vanessa atalanta {{are capable of}} managing a fierce headwind. In case of headwind, they usually fly low and are more goal-oriented. During migration, some species {{can be found at}} high altitudes, ranging to up to two kilometers. This is especially noteworthy for day-flying species like Vanessa atalanta, since the temperatures on these altitudes are low and day-flying species depend on the <b>outside</b> <b>temperature</b> to stay warm. It is thought that Vanessa atalanta produces enough body warmth during flight since it has also been recorded migrating at night.|$|E
25|$|When an area's albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature {{feedback}} results. A {{layer of}} snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no <b>outside</b> <b>temperature</b> change affects this area (e.g., a warm air mass), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback. However, because local weather is dynamic {{due to the}} change of seasons, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher insolation) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.|$|E

25|$|Kangaroo rats live {{in complex}} burrow systems. The burrows have {{separate}} chambers for specific purposes like sleeping, living and food storage. The spacing of the burrows {{depends on the}} number of kangaroo rats and the abundance of food. Kangaroo rats also live in colonies that range from six to several hundred dens. The burrow of a kangaroo rat is important in providing protection from the harsh desert environment. To maintain a constant temperature and relative humidity in their burrows, kangaroo rats plug the entrances with soil during the day. When the <b>outside</b> <b>temperature</b> is too hot, a kangaroo rat stays in its cool, humid burrow and leaves it only at night. To reduce loss of moisture through respiration when sleeping, a kangaroo rat buries its nose in its fur to accumulate a small pocket of moist air. The burrows of Merriam's kangaroo rats are simpler and shallower than those of banner-tailed kangaroo rats. Banner-tailed kangaroo rats also mate in their burrows, unlike Merriam's kangaroo rats.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{a variety}} of {{influence}} factors, <b>outside</b> dry-bulb <b>temperature</b> takes on a systematic and random fluctuation. If a deterministic model is used to forecast the dry-bulb temperature, the predicted result often has a rough accuracy. Neural network can learn the internal regularity of the sample data by sample training; therefore it has very much adaptability and advantage in the aspects of forecast. The influence factors of <b>outside</b> dry-bulb <b>temperature</b> exist difference in the daytime and the nighttime, which makes the fluctuant regularity of <b>outside</b> dry-bulb <b>temperature</b> inconsistent.

500|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the indoor-outdoor {{thermometer}} is to allow the <b>outside</b> <b>temperature</b> to be indicated inside a building, thus removing the need to go outside to take a temperature reading. [...] They are also used in vehicles, and are particularly useful for municipal vehicles involved in snow and ice clearance. Building maintenance engineers can use an indoor-outdoor thermometer that has not been installed to get a quick reading of air temperature in a location inside a building. [...] This is done by swinging the bulb of the outdoor sensor in the air while still attached to the instrument. This will get a faster reading because the bulb will come up to temperature much more quickly than the indoor sensor built into the instrument.|$|E
500|$|Ambient {{corrections}} {{are difficult}} to achieve with this system and are not usually done. So {{it is not as}} accurate as a conventional precision thermometer. [...] Rather, it is typically used for low-cost applications such as private houses. [...] The main issue with accuracy is that if the bulb and the stem are at different levels, there is a change in reading due to the change in pressure head. [...] A further problem is that changes in the ambient temperature of the indoor part of the device can cause a change in reading as well as the temperature of the outdoor part of the device. [...] This effect can be minimised by making the bulb large and the capillary a small diameter. [...] This ensures that changes in the <b>outside</b> <b>temperature</b> produce large changes in the column of liquid in the stem and will tend to swamp the smaller changes caused by the changes in the indoor temperature.|$|E
