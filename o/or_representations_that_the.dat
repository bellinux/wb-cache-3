40|$|A {{number of}} authors has {{described}} predominant discourses {{on climate change}} as profoundly depoliticised. At the same time, however, other scholars have challenged this ‘post-political thesis’ for not taking the multiplicity of voices and actually existing forms of contestation enough into account. In this paper, I will investigate the tension between these two positions and show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> existence of diverging voices does not disprove the post-political thesis as such. Admittedly, focusing primarily on processes of depoliticisation bears the risk of shifting attention away from movements <b>that</b> have <b>the</b> potential to repoliticise. Nevertheless, post-politics remains a useful, critical notion that does not deny {{the existence of these}} forms of contestation. On the contrary, even in so far oppositional voices are present, predominant representations can still be criticised as they make their political nature invisible. In this paper, I will elaborate upon contemporary debates with regard to the post-political in relation to climate change, both from a theoretical and an empirical point of view. Theoretically, the paper draws on the work of Chantal Mouffe, Ernesto Laclau, Jacques Rancière en Slavoj Žižek. Empirically, the paper is based on research concerning two grassroots climate movements, namely the Transition Towns and Climate Justice Action movement, both of which arose {{a few years ago and}} have variably been depicted as profoundly political and depoliticised by different scholars. As I will argue, in many of these debates it is overlooked that it is on the level of discourse <b>or</b> <b>representation</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> diagnosis of post-politics should be made. It is not reality as such which is post-political, but the way reality is portrayed. On this basis I will argue that post-politics is a real problem for climate movements, from the perspective of both effectiveness and democracy, and the attempt to overcome it is not only a necessity but also a profound challenge for them. status: publishe...|$|R

In three experiments we assessed the eVect of manipulating task irrelevant static context features in a serial reaction-time task. Experiment 1 demonstrated impaired performance after simultaneously changing display color, placeholder shape, and placeholder location. Experiment 2 showed that this eVect was mainly caused by changing placeholder shape. Finally, Experiment 3 indicated that changing context aVected both the application of sequence knowledge and the selection of individual responses.

40|$|Multi-modal image {{registration}} {{is needed to}} align medical images collected from different protocols or imag-ing sources, thereby allowing the mapping of complementary information between images. One challenge of multimodal {{image registration}} is that typical similarity measures rely on statistical correlations between im-age intensities to determine anatomical alignment. The use of alternate image representations could allow for mapping of intensities into a space <b>or</b> <b>representation</b> such <b>that</b> <b>the</b> multimodal images appear more similar, thus facilitating their co-registration. In this work, we present a spectral embedding based registration (SERg) method that uses non-linearly embedded representations obtained from independent components of statistical texture maps of the original images to facilitate multimodal image registration. Our methodology comprises the following main steps: 1) image-derived textural representation of the original images, 2) dimensionality reduction using independent component analysis (ICA), 3) spectral embedding to generate the alternate representations, and 4) image registration. The rationale behind our approach is that SERg yields embedded <b>representations</b> <b>that</b> can allow for very different looking images to appear more similar, thereby facilitating improved co-registration. Statistical texture features are derived from the image intensities and then reduced to a smaller set by using independent component analysis to remove redundant information. Spectral embedding generates a new repre...|$|R
