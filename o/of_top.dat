40|$|The {{relationship}} between sodium contents <b>of</b> <b>tops</b> and transpiration rates was studied in two rice varieties with different sodium exclusion rates in roots; Kala-Rata 1 - 24 (KR 1;low exclusion rate) and IR 28 (high exclusion rate). Seedlings at 7 th leaf stage grown in culture solution {{were subjected to}} saline water(100 mM sodium chloride) and transpired for 12 hours. Various transpiration rates were obtained under different humidity, light intensity and temperature conditions. Transpiration stream concentration factor of Na+ (TSCFNa+), which denotes the sodium exclusion rate in the root, decreased with increase in the transpiration rate under different humidity and light intensity conditions. On the other hand, TSCFNa+ was lower in KR 1 than in IR 28 under different temperature conditions. There were no different in the sodium exclusion rates at high transpiration rates. Sodium contents <b>of</b> <b>tops</b> initially increased with the transpiration rates but afterwards decreased with the transpiration rates. Sodium contents <b>of</b> <b>tops</b> were higher in KR 1 than in IR 28 at low transpiration rates under high humidity and low light intensity conditions, but it was higher in IR 28 under low temperature conditions. There were no varietal differences in the sodium contents <b>of</b> <b>tops</b> at high transpiration rates. These {{results indicated that the}} varietal differences in sodium exclusion rates were detectable at low transpiration rates and affected the sodium contents <b>of</b> <b>tops,</b> but there were no differences in the sodium contents <b>of</b> <b>tops</b> at high transpiration rates. イネでは、ナトリウム（Na) 含有率が高いほど光合成速度、苗の生存率および相対生長速度が低下することから、塩ストレス下における体内Na含有率の品種間差異に着目した研究が進められてきた。しかし、塩ストレスに対する体内Na含有率の品種による反応は、研究によって異なる。Makiharaらは、幼苗期にNa含有率が異なるとされる品種を成熟まで栽培したところ、Na含有率に大きな差異を見出さなかった。また、Makiharaらの研究でNa含有率が低かった品種が、森田らの研究では高かった。イネは、根においてナトリウムイオン（Na+）を分離排除する能力をもし、その程度は品種によって異なる。この能力は体内に入り込む水のNa+濃度に影響を与えるのが、体内に取り込まれるNa+の質は、流れる水の総量に影響される。すなわち、イネのNa含有率は、蒸散量と蒸散流に含まれるNa+濃度によって決まり、後者は根におけるNa+排除率によって変わる。蒸散と排除率はいずれも環境条件によって変わると考えられ、それによって体内Na含有率も変わるであろう。したがって、研究によってNa含有率の反応が異なるのは、両者の相互作用によると考えられえる。しかし、蒸散量とNa+排除率の変化が体内Na含有率にどのように影響を与えるのかは知られていないので、本研究で調べた...|$|R

40|$|Kruglovskiy {{field is}} a quite simple {{geological}} structure of small thickness of productive layers, {{and includes a}} small amount of karstic and off-grade rocks. We analyzed the spatial distribution of the following parameters and indicators of deposit: thickness of gypsum strata, the average content of gypsum in the well, thickness of overburden, the thickness of karst intervals, thickness of the substandard grade rock, elevation of surface relief, and elevation <b>of</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> gypsum and the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> anhydrite layers. There was observed close and very close correlation between the pairs of indicators.

Negative correlation was revealed between overburden thickness and elevation <b>of</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> gypsum layer, overburden thickness and elevation <b>of</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> anhydrite layer, and between overburden thickness and thickness of gypsum stratum. The correlation results indicated that gypsum deposit has, in general, sheet-like shape, a groundwater table elevation changed in the process of hydration of anhydrite relative to the earth's surface, the big thickness of overburden brought a negative effect on the formation of deposit, and its total thickness of gypsum strata was relatively small...|$|R
