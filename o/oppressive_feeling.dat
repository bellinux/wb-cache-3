60|$|All {{this went}} on in her with the rapidity of a sick dream; and her start into {{resistance}} was {{very much like a}} waking. Suddenly from out the gray sombre morning there came a stream of sunshine, wrapping her in warmth and light where she sat in stony stillness. She moved gently and looked round her--there was a world outside this bad dream, and the dream proved nothing; she rose, stretching her arms upward and clasping her hands with her habitual attitude when she was seeking relief from <b>oppressive</b> <b>feeling,</b> and walked about the room in this flood of sunbeams.|$|E
6000|$|He looked {{round at}} the meeting. They {{were no longer}} antagonists; they were spectators. He {{would have to go}} through with it now. But this tone of {{personal}} aggression on the maker of the remark had somehow got rid of the <b>oppressive</b> <b>feeling</b> of Hoopdriver contra mundum. Apparently, he would have to fight someone. Would he get a black eye? Would he get very much hurt? Pray goodness it wasn't that sturdy chap in the gaiters! Should he rise and begin? What would she think if he brought a black eye to breakfast to-morrow? [...] "Is this the man?" [...] said Mr. Hoopdriver, with a business-like calm, and arms more angular than ever.|$|E
40|$|This article covers one of {{the most}} {{important}} anthropological insights into thinking Viktor Frankl and Karl Jaspers: limit situations which generate confusion and anguish, and the chan- ces of finding meaning in suffering. These ex- treme situations confront the person with his particular world generating a host of existential questions that lead to skepticism and empty nonsense to not seeing behind them no posi- tivity for life. However, in suffering every indi- vidual can truly conquer their existence to find a positive way beyond the <b>oppressive</b> <b>feelings</b> that accompany these experiences. Thus limit situations, with its paradoxical nature, stimula- tes original processes of struggle and choice of individual destiny amid a hostile, confusing and often incomprehensible world...|$|R
60|$|It was {{a relief}} to the party when they emerged from the forests into the little clearings where villages had once stood, for the gloom and quiet of the great forest weighed upon the spirits. The {{monotonous}} too too of the doves--not a slow dreamy cooing like that of the English variety, but a sharp quick note repeated in endless succession--alone broke the hush. The silence, the apparently never ending forest, the monotony of rank vegetation, the absence of a breath of wind to rustle a leaf, were most <b>oppressive,</b> and the <b>feeling</b> was not lessened by the dampness and heaviness of the air, and the malarious exhalation and smell of decaying vegetation arising from the swamps.|$|R

The women in the group were initially just part of a group I joined. Now they’ve become a family I’m a part of. These new-found mothers and sisters have become the wind beneath my wings, keeping me afloat, keeping me away from drugs and the slippery slope that leads to suicide. ” —ROAD member At the heart of a social justice perspective generally, and a feminist perspective more specifically, is a recognition that the individual struggles experienced by so many people are rooted in oppressive social, political, and cultural forces (Atkinson, Thompson, & Grant, 1993; Morrow & Hawxhurt, 1998). According to this view, helping clients from oppressed communities to explore the psychodynamic or cog- 267 266 GOODMAN ETAL. nitive contributors to their emotional difficulties, although potentially valuable, can do no more than help people adjust to an <b>oppressive</b> status quo; <b>feelings</b> of alienation...|$|R
60|$|I {{find much}} relief in that thought. It at once lifts from my {{shoulders}} the <b>oppressive</b> <b>feeling</b> of responsibility that was weighing me down. After all, {{what does it}} matter what I say? What does it matter what any of us says about anything? Nobody takes much notice of it, luckily for everybody. This reflection must be of great comfort to editors and critics. A conscientious man who really felt that his words would carry weight and influence with them would be almost afraid to speak at all. It is the man who knows that it will not make an ounce of difference to anyone what he says, that can grow eloquent and vehement and positive. It will not make any difference to anybody or anything what I say about the Ober-Ammergau Passion Play. So I shall just say what I want to.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was awake}} last night. I had an <b>oppressive</b> <b>feeling,</b> perhaps a presentiment. Anyway, I couldn't sleep. I heard that wind blow through the forest, and thought my blood would freeze. The moan {{is the same}} as the night wind, the same soft sigh, only louder and somehow {{pregnant}} with superhuman power. To speak of it in broad daylight one seems superstitious, but to hear it in the darkness of this lonely forest, it is fearful! I hope I am not a coward; I certainly know I was deathly frightened. No wonder I was scared! Look at these dead Indians, all killed in a moment. I heard the moan; I saw Silvertip disappear, and the other two savages rise. Then something huge dropped from the rock; a bright object seemed to circle round the savages; they uttered one short yell, and sank to rise no more. Somehow at once I suspected that this shadowy form, with its lightninglike movements, its glittering hatchet, was Wetzel. When he plunged into the midst of the other savages I distinctly recognized him, and saw that he had a bundle, possibly his coat, wrapped round his left arm, and his right hand held the glittering tomahawk. I saw him strike that big Indian there, the one lying with split skull. His wonderful daring and quickness seemed to make the savages turn at random. He broke through the circle, swung Nell under his arm, slashed at my bonds as he passed by, and then was gone as he had come. Not until after you were struck, and Silvertip came up to me, was I aware my bonds were cut. Wetzel's hatchet had severed them; it even cut my side, which was bleeding. I was free to help, to fight, and I did not know it. Fool that I am!" ...|$|E
60|$|On this object, {{and on this}} alone, Hans's {{eyes and}} {{thoughts}} were fixed. Forgetting the distance he had to traverse, he set off at an imprudent rate of walking, which greatly exhausted him before he had scaled the first range of the green and low hills. He was, moreover, surprised, on surmounting them, to find that a large glacier, of whose existence, notwithstanding his previous knowledge of the mountains, he had been absolutely ignorant, lay {{between him and the}} source of the Golden River. He entered on it with the boldness of a practiced mountaineer, yet he thought he had never traversed so strange or so dangerous a glacier in his life. The ice was excessively slippery, and out of all its chasms came wild sounds of gushing water--not monotonous or low, but changeful and loud, rising occasionally into drifting passages of wild melody, then breaking off into short, melancholy tones or sudden shrieks resembling those of human voices in distress or pain. The ice was broken into thousands of confused shapes, but none, Hans thought, like the ordinary forms of splintered ice. There seemed a curious EXPRESSION about all their outlines--a perpetual resemblance to living features, distorted and scornful. Myriads of deceitful shadows and lurid lights played and floated about and through the pale blue pinnacles, dazzling and confusing the sight of the traveler, while his ears grew dull and his head giddy with the constant gush and roar of the concealed waters. These painful circumstances increased upon him as he advanced; the ice crashed and yawned into fresh chasms at his feet, tottering spires nodded around him and fell thundering across his path; and though he had repeatedly faced these dangers on the most terrific glaciers and in the wildest weather, it was with a new and <b>oppressive</b> <b>feeling</b> of panic terror that he leaped the last chasm and flung himself, exhausted and shuddering, on the firm turf of the mountain.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{something}} akin to this <b>oppressive</b> <b>feeling</b> may have weighed upon you in watching this old-fashioned family life {{on the banks of}} the Floss, which even sorrow hardly suffices to lift above the level of the tragi-comic. It is a sordid life, you say, this of the Tullivers and Dodsons, irradiated by no sublime principles, no romantic visions, no active, self-renouncing faith; moved by none of those wild, uncontrollable passions which create the dark shadows of misery and crime; without that primitive, rough simplicity of wants, that hard, submissive, ill-paid toil, that childlike spelling-out of what nature has written, which gives its poetry to peasant life. Here one has conventional worldly notions and habits without instruction and without polish, surely the most prosaic form of human life; proud respectability in a gig of unfashionable build; worldliness without side-dishes. Observing these people narrowly, even when the iron hand of misfortune has shaken them from their unquestioning hold on the world, one sees little trace of religion, still less of a distinctively Christian creed. Their belief in the Unseen, so far as it manifests itself at all, seems to be rather a pagan kind; their moral notions, though held with strong tenacity, seem to have no standard beyond hereditary custom. You could not live among such people; you are stifled for want of an outlet toward something beautiful, great, or noble; you are irritated with these dull men and women, as a kind of population out of keeping with the earth on which they live,--with this rich plain where the great river flows forever onward, and links the small pulse of the old English town with the beatings of the world's mighty heart. A vigorous superstition, that lashes its gods or lashes its own back, seems to be more congruous with the mystery of the human lot, than the mental condition of these emmet-like Dodsons and Tullivers.|$|E
6000|$|Longmore {{sank back}} with a sigh and an <b>oppressive</b> <b>feeling</b> that it was vain to guess at such a woman's motives. He only felt that those of this one were buried deep in her soul and {{that they must be}} of the noblest, must contain nothing base. He had his hard {{impression}} that endless constancy was all her law--a constancy that still found a foothold among crumbling ruins. [...] "She has loved once," [...] he said to himself as he rose and wandered to his window; [...] "and that's for ever. Yes, yes--if she loved again she'd be COMMON!" [...] He stood for a long time looking out into the starlit silence of the town and forest and thinking of what life would have been if his constancy had met her own in earlier days. But life was this now, and he must live. It was living, really, to stand there with such a faith even in one's self still flung over one by such hands. He was not to disappoint her, he was to justify a conception it had beguiled her weariness to form. His imagination embraced it; he threw back his head and seemed to be looking for his friend's conception among the blinking mocking stars. But it came to him rather on the mild night-wind wandering in over the house-tops which covered the rest of so many heavy human hearts. What she asked he seemed to feel her ask not for her own sake--she feared nothing, she needed nothing--but for that of his own happiness and his own character. He must assent to destiny. Why else was he young and strong, intelligent and resolute? He mustn't give it to her to reproach him with thinking she had had a moment's attention for his love, give it to her to plead, to argue, to break off in bitterness. He must see everything from above, her indifference and his own ardour; he must prove his strength, must do the handsome thing, must decide that the handsome thing was to submit to the inevitable, to be supremely delicate, to spare her all pain, to stifle his passion, to ask no compensation, to depart without waiting and to try to believe that wisdom is its own reward. All this, neither more nor less, {{it was a matter of}} beautiful friendship with him for her to expect of him. And what should he himself gain by it? He should have pleased her! Well, he flung himself on his bed again, fell asleep at last and slept till morning.|$|E
6000|$|One may at the blest end of May say without {{injustice}} {{to anybody}} {{that the state}} of mind of many a forestiero in Rome is one of intense impatience for the moment when all other forestieri shall have taken themselves off. One may confess to this state of mind and be no misanthrope. The place has passed so completely for the winter months {{into the hands of the}} barbarians that that estimable character the passionate pilgrim finds it constantly harder to keep his passion clear. He has a rueful sense of impressions perverted and adulterated; the all-venerable visage disconcerts us by a vain eagerness to see itself mirrored in English, American, German eyes. It isn't simply that you are never first or never alone at the classic or historic spots where you have dreamt of persuading the shy genius loci into confidential utterance; it isn't simply that St. Peter's, the Vatican, the Palatine, are for ever ringing with the false note of the languages without style: it is the general <b>oppressive</b> <b>feeling</b> that the city of the soul has become for the time a monstrous mixture of watering-place and curiosity- shop and that its most ardent life is that of the tourists who haggle over false intaglios and yawn through palaces and temples. But you are told of a happy time when these abuses begin to pass away, when Rome becomes Rome again and you may have her all to yourself. [...] "You may like her more or less now," [...] I was assured at the height of the season; [...] "but you must wait till the month of May, when she'll give you all she has, to love her. Then the foreigners, or the excess of them, are gone; the galleries and ruins are empty, and the place," [...] said my informant, who was a happy Frenchman of the Académie de France, [...] "renait a ellememe." [...] Indeed I was haunted all winter by an irresistible prevision of what Rome must be in declared spring. Certain charming places seemed to murmur: [...] "Ah, this is nothing! Come back at the right weeks and see the sky above us almost black with its excess of blue, and the new grass already deep, but still vivid, and the white roses tumble in odorous spray and the warm radiant air distil gold for the smelting-pot that the genius loci then dips his brush into before making play with it, in his inimitable way, for the general effect of complexion." ...|$|E

Her eyes can't seem to focus but she thinks she sees two transparent figures walking towards her through the mist that hovers over the lawn. She panics, screams and runs to Jamie who returns with her to investigate. Everything appears normal until, suddenly, they both {{become aware of the}} <b>oppressive</b> <b>feeling</b> and the repeating, hypnotic blackbird song. The two figures are walking towards them through the mist and as they draw near, the figures solidify into a young girl, about their age and a younger boy. Jamie and Lucy are relieved to meet what appear to be two ordinary children, albeit that their clothes seem a little old-fashioned.

50|$|The fourteenth of the {{alphabet}} novels takes place mainly in the small-town mountain community of Nota Lake, California (population 2,356, elevation 4,312) where Kinsey has inherited a client called Selma Newquist from her periodic boyfriend Robert Dietz, temporarily out of action back home in Carson City, where Kinsey has reluctantly been {{taking care of him}} following knee surgery. Through much of the novel there is an <b>oppressive</b> <b>feeling</b> of both physical and metaphorical cold as Kinsey tries to cope with being out of her Santa Teresa comfort zone. Selma's brief is vague: she fears her husband Tom, a sheriff's officer who {{died of a heart attack}} a few weeks before, had something on his mind at the time of his death, and she wants Kinsey to find out what it was.|$|E
5000|$|Stylistically, {{the film}} {{achieves}} a surprisingly {{high degree of}} realism, especially in the trench and battle scenes. The monotony of dying reinforces the <b>oppressive</b> <b>feeling</b> of authenticity. In addition, there are [...] "small" [...] silent scenes, such as when the student almost incidentally observes grave markers being made {{in a range of}} carpentry on the assembly line, or when Karl's mother is reluctant to leave their place in the food queue when they again see her son. But Pabst wanted more than just [...] "Realism" [...] : [...] "I a realist? From my very first movie I have chosen realistic themes, but with the intention resolutely to be a stylist. ... Realism must be a trampoline from which you jump higher and higher; in itself it has no value. The point is to overcome reality. Realism is a means, not an end." [...] (Quoted in : Tape Man / Hembus, p. 21). So it is not through the combat scenes, but the individual stories of four soldiers that Pabst illustrates pacifist sentiment: belief {{in the power of the}} international solidarity of ordinary people. After the Nazis had seized power in 1933, the film was banned because it was considered [...] "a very one-sided and therefore false representation of war" [...] that would jeopardize [...] "the vital interest of the state to affirm, maintain and strengthen the military will of the people" [...] (text of the prohibition application at the German Film Institute).|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to examine the {{creative}} ways in which John Tzetzes (c. 1110 – after 1160) uses the figure of Cato the Elder within his Chiliads. In appropriating Cato’s care for his son’s education to his own pedagogical relationship with his father, Tzetzes departs significantly from Plutarch’s original (Life of Cato Maior). This recreation leads him, as I argue, to engage with notions of Hellenism in twelfth-century Byzantium, to uncover his anxieties stemming from the <b>oppressive</b> <b>feeling</b> of poverty, and to castigate current social conditions that irritated him, for instance the corruption of the ecclesiastical establishment. I additionally cast light on Tzetzes’ scholarly inventiveness; that is manifested in the way he infuses his own self-portrait with Cato’s qualities in an attempt to exonerate it from public censure...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} {{the characteristics of a}} new developed five-fingered haptic interface robot named HIRO II. The haptic interface can present force and tactile feeling at the five fingertips of the human hand. It is designed to be completely safe and similar to the human upper limb both in shape and motion ability. Its mechanism consists of a 6 DOF arm and a 15 DOF hand. The interface is placed opposite to the human hand, which brings safety and no <b>oppressive</b> <b>feeling,</b> but this leads to difficulty in controlling the haptic interface because it should follow the hand poses of the operator. A redundant force control method in which all the joints of the mechanism were force controlled simultaneously to present the virtual force is studied. Experimental results to show high potential of a multi-fingered haptic interface are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{available}} {{literature on}} various side-effects occurring at theadministration of Antabuse all deals mainly {{with the development}} of severe psychotic symptoms. as for the causes of such side-effect systemic poisoning or the cerebral organic disturbances accompaning it or the activation of dormant factor can be pointed out, but in the present investigation the auther studied mild side-effects that usually appear transiently; namely drowsiness, malaise loss of appetite, sweating, headache, fever, and <b>oppressive</b> <b>feeling</b> by means of electroencephalogram. In 37 cases given Antabuse severe psychotic symptoms appear in one case, and mild sideeffect in 15 cases. Of them abnormal encephalographic waves appeared in 12 cases. One case indicated the existence of organic damages, and two cases the organic damages reactivating dormant epileptic factor or inducing epilepsy. The electroencepharogram of epilepsy in the case not revealing severe clinical symptoms was also reactivated; and in 4 cases the electroencephalogram of epilepsy or abnormal wave close to it appeared. The electroencephalogram was not reactivated in two cases with organic damages. In the other two cases the so-called transitional wave appeared. From these, the fact that 7 out of 12 cases had organic damages or revealed abnormal waves suggesting the existence of such damages indicates that the toxicity of Antabuse is virulent and that during the intoxication it will generally inflict damages to the brain...|$|E
40|$|Xenomelia is the <b>oppressive</b> <b>feeling</b> {{that one}} or more limbs of one's body {{do not belong to}} one's self. We present the results of a {{thorough}} examination of the characteristics of the disorder in 15 males with a strong desire for amputation of one or both legs. The feeling of estrangement had been present since early childhood and was limited to a precisely demarcated part of the leg in all individuals. Neurological status examination and neuropsychological testing were normal in all participants, and psychiatric evaluation ruled out the presence of a psychotic disorder. In 13 individuals and in 13 pair-matched control participants, magnetic resonance imaging was performed, and surface-based morphometry revealed significant group differences in cortical architecture. In the right hemisphere, participants with xenomelia showed reduced cortical thickness in the superior parietal lobule and reduced cortical surface area in the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, in the inferior parietal lobule, {{as well as in the}} anterior insular cortex. A cluster of increased thickness was located in the central sulcus. In the left hemisphere, affected individuals evinced a larger cortical surface area in the inferior parietal lobule and secondary somatosensory cortex. Although of modest size, these structural correlates of xenomelia appear meaningful when discussed against the background of some key clinical features of the disorder. Thus, the predominantly right-sided cortical abnormalities are in line with a strong bias for left-sided limbs as the target of the amputation desire, evident both in our sample and in previously described populations with xenomelia. We also propose that the higher incidence of lower compared with upper limbs (∼ 80 % according to previous investigations) may explain the erotic connotations typically associated with xenomelia, also in the present sample. These may have their roots in the proximity of primary somatosensory cortex for leg representation, whose surface area was reduced in the participants with xenomelia, with that of the genitals. Alternatively, the spatial adjacency of secondary somatosensory cortex for leg representation and the anterior insula, the latter known to mediate sexual arousal beyond that induced by direct tactile stimulation of the genital area, might play a role. Although the right hemisphere regions of significant neuroarchitectural correlates of xenomelia are part of a network reportedly subserving body ownership, it remains unclear whether the structural alterations are the cause or rather the consequence of the long-standing and pervasive mismatch between body and sel...|$|E
