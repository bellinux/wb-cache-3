40|$|Urine {{specimens}} from 23 {{children and}} 9 adults who were undergoing treatment for malignancy {{as well as}} urines from 40 normal individuals were concentrated and examined for evidence of papovavirus infection. Papovavirus particles were detected in 6 <b>of</b> 64 <b>urines</b> examined by electron microscopy. Three <b>of</b> the particle-positive <b>urines</b> induced BK virus-specific immunofluorescence after inoculation of WI 38 cells, and three isolations of BK virus were made by inoculation <b>of</b> <b>urines</b> from virus-excreting patients into Vero cells. BK virus-specific hemagglutination-inhibiting and immunofluorescence neutralizing antibodies were found in a majority <b>of</b> <b>urines</b> from adult patients, in {{about a fifth of}} pediatric patients, and less often in normal <b>urines.</b> <b>Urines</b> <b>of</b> virus-excreting patients generally had antibodies. In indirect fluorescent antibody tests, BK virus-specific antibodies of the immunoglobulin G class were found in five urine specimens from patients; immunoglobulin A antibodies were not detected in any urine. These data suggest that activation of BK virus is related to immunosuppression and not to transplantation itself and that the occurrence of virus-specific antibodies in urine may be indicative of virus multiplication in the urinary tract...|$|R

5|$|A {{determination}} {{of whether or}} not the person has dehydration is an important part of the assessment, with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases. In children, the most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged capillary refill, poor skin turgor, and abnormal breathing. Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth. A normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring. Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration. Thus the use <b>of</b> <b>urine</b> testing or ultrasounds is generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|In {{medieval times}} trades {{were carried out}} in {{workshops}} {{in and around the}} owners' premises in the City. By the time of the Great Fire these were becoming industries and some were particularly noisome, such as the processing <b>of</b> <b>urine</b> to perform tanning; or required large amounts of space, such as drying clothes after process and dying in fields known as tentergrounds; and rope making. Some were dangerous, such as the manufacture of gunpowder or the proving of guns. These activities came to be performed outside the City walls in the near suburbs of the East End. Later when lead making and bone processing for soap and china came to be established, they too located in the East End rather than the crowded streets of the City.|$|E
5|$|Poisoning {{symptoms}} are rapid in onset, consisting initially of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and associated decreased blood volume. Shortly after these initial symptoms appear, hemolysis develops, resulting in reduced urine output, hemoglobin {{in the urine}} or outright absence <b>of</b> <b>urine</b> formation, and anemia. Medical laboratory tests consist of testing {{for the presence of}} increasing bilirubin and free hemoglobin, and falling haptoglobins. Hemolysis may lead to numerous complications including acute renal failure, shock, acute respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. These complications can cause significant morbidity with fatalities having been reported.|$|E

5|$|Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) {{kidney failure}} {{is the result}} of {{ethylene}} glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12–24 hours after getting into antifreeze; in dogs, at 36–72 hours after getting into antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetance may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production <b>of</b> <b>urine,</b> elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.|$|E
5|$|Systemic {{symptoms}} {{resulting from}} anaphylaxis can be dramatic. These may appear within 5 minutes post bite, {{or can be}} delayed for many hours.

5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} {{at or above}} the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs and hips, genitourinary system, and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles. Bowel and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region. It is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury, as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including fecal and urinary incontinence. It is also possible for the bladder to fail to empty, leading to a potentially harmful buildup <b>of</b> <b>urine.</b> One sign of spinal cord injury that emergency providers may find is priapism, an erection of the penis.|$|E

40|$|Crystal {{agglomeration}} is a {{major element}} in calcium oxalate urinary stone formation. The effects <b>of</b> <b>urines</b> from 36 healthy subjects and 86 calcium oxalate renal stone formers on calcium oxalate monohydrate crystallization kinetics were studied using a seeded crystal growth method in which the solubility, the growth and the agglomeration of the crystals are measured as three separate and system-independent parameters. The <b>urines</b> <b>of</b> healthy subjects were found to increase the solubility and to strongly inhibit the growth and the agglomeration of calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals. The <b>urines</b> <b>of</b> stone formers had a similar effect on the solubility, but a significantly lower ability to inhibit the crystal growth and the crystal agglomeration. Of these two kinetic processes the inhibition of crystal agglomeration was more clearly affected, with 55 % of the stone formers having abnormally low values, while the changes in crystal growth inhibition occurred within the normal range. The defect in crystal agglomeration inhibition was related to stone frequency, and urines from patients with very high stone frequency rates had also the most severely impaired ability to inhibit the agglomeration of the calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals. The inhibitory effect <b>of</b> <b>urines</b> on crystal agglomeration {{was found to be}} related to its citrate content (r = 0. 68, P < 0. 001). All patients with hypocitraturia, except two, had also abnormally low values for crystal agglomeration inhibition. In a group of 15 hypocitraturic stone formers, alkali treatment for a mean period of 18 months resulted in a parallel increase in urinary citrate excretion and in the ability <b>of</b> <b>urines</b> to inhibit crystal agglomeration (r = 0. 77, P < 0. 001). These results show that defective inhibition of the kinetic process of crystal agglomeration constitutes a major physicochemical mechanism of calcium oxalate renal stone formation, which appears to be modulated by urinary citrate concentrations...|$|R

5|$|Frogs {{have served}} as {{experimental}} animals {{throughout the history of}} science. Eighteenth-century biologist Luigi Galvani discovered the link between electricity and the nervous system by studying frogs. In 1852, H. F. Stannius used a frog's heart in a procedure called a Stannius ligature to demonstrate the ventricle and atria beat independently of each other and at different rates. The African clawed frog or platanna (Xenopus laevis) was first widely used in laboratories in pregnancy tests {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. A sample <b>of</b> <b>urine</b> from a pregnant woman injected into a female frog induces it to lay eggs, a discovery made by English zoologist Lancelot Hogben. This is because a hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, is present in substantial quantities in the urine of women during pregnancy. In 1952, Robert Briggs and Thomas J. King cloned a frog by somatic cell nuclear transfer. This same technique was later used to create Dolly the sheep, and their experiment was the first time a successful nuclear transplantation had been accomplished in higher animals.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have sought}} to find the precise {{function}} of Mups in pheromone communication. Mup proteins {{have been shown to}} promote puberty and accelerate the estrus cycle in female mice, inducing the Vandenbergh and Whitten effects. However, in both cases the Mups had to be presented to the female dissolved in male urine, indicating that the protein requires some urinary context to function. In 2007 Mups normally found in male mouse urine were made in transgenic bacteria, and therefore created devoid of the chemicals they normally bind. These Mups were shown to be sufficient to promote aggressive behaviour in males, even in the absence <b>of</b> <b>urine.</b> In addition, Mups made in bacteria were found to activate olfactory sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), a subsystem of the nose known to detect pheromones via specific sensory receptors, of mice and rats. Together, this demonstrated that Mup proteins can act as pheromones themselves, independent of their ligands.|$|E

In Kishima area, livestock's urine is reused as liquid fertilizer with a kind of simple process, by which livestock's urine simply mixed with some phosphoric acid and silicone is used as one kind of liquid fertilizer in paddy fields. The merits of the disposition process to livestock farmers can be concluded as : firtly, the cost <b>of</b> livestock's <b>urine</b> disposition can be cut considerably, secondly, farmland can be reserved by recirclar use <b>of</b> livestock's <b>urine,</b> and thidly, the labor burdan bearing with livestock's urine disposition can be lightened greatly. As well the merits to cultivation farmers include : to lighten the labor burdan of fertilizer spreading, to cut the cost of the chemical fertilizer, to improve the quality of rice and to stabilize the yield of rice, to provide the high value-added agricultural products.
