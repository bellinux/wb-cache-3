5|$|The {{characteristics}} <b>of</b> <b>boulder</b> problems depend {{largely on}} the type of rock being climbed. Granite, for example, often features long cracks and slabs. Sandstone rocks are known for their steep overhangs and frequent horizontal breaks. Other common bouldering rocks include limestone and volcanic rock.|$|E
5|$|The harbour and {{the mouth}} of the River Esk are on a {{geological}} fault. On the east side the cliff is tall, , and consists of alternating layers of shale, sandstone and clay. On the west side the cliff is much lower and has a deep capping <b>of</b> <b>boulder</b> clay over a sandstone base making it less stable and liable to slippage. Both cliffs are being eroded quite rapidly.|$|E
5|$|The soils of {{the islands}} reflect the diverse geology. Bute has the most {{productive}} land, and a pattern of deposits that {{is typical of the}} southwest of Scotland. There is a mixture <b>of</b> <b>boulder</b> clay and other glacial deposits in the eroded valleys, and raised beach and marine deposits elsewhere, especially to the south and west which result in a machair landscape in places, inland from the sandy bays, such as Stravanan.|$|E

Three potbelly monuments were found resting on a large terrace in Santa Leticia in El Salvador, a site near Chalchuapa consisting of various mounds and platforms. These monuments were large and especially obese. Santa Leticia Monuments 1 and 3 were important in securely dating the potbelly style of sculpture.

5|$|Greater Manchester {{is mainly}} urban, {{and is one}} of the most densely {{populated}} regions in Europe. In the second half of the 18thcentury, the Industrial Revolution played an important role in the growth and development of Manchester and its surrounding area, and industry continues to be a major part of the region's economy. There are few buildings surviving from before the Industrial Revolution, but many from the 19th and 20thcenturies. The bedrock consists mainly of Carboniferous sandstones, including millstone grit, which is a major source of building material for the region's churches. The superficial deposits are <b>of</b> <b>boulder</b> clay, which provides material for making bricks.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the last}} ice age the eastern {{coastline}} of the area was located along the eastern foot of the Yorkshire Wolds where remnants of beaches have been discovered. The North Sea ice sheet deposited huge amounts <b>of</b> <b>boulder</b> clay as it retreated and this subsequently formed a wet and swampy area which became the plain of Holderness. Another ice sheet in the Vale of York retreated at the same time leaving thick glacial deposits and two prominent moraines {{to the west of the}} Wolds. These Vale of York deposits also formed wetlands. The Wolds themselves were largely ice-free, well drained, chalk uplands. Gradually the tundra conditions that had existed as the ice retreated gave way to vegetation that could support grazing fauna. Because a lot of water was still locked in the northern ice sheets, sea level was much lower than in the present day and an area of land stretched eastwards to the low countries.|$|E

30|$|The {{surface of}} {{asteroid}} 25143 Itokawa {{is covered with}} numerous boulders although gravity is very small {{compared with that of}} other asteroids previously observed from spacecraft. Here we report the size-frequency statistics <b>of</b> <b>boulders</b> on the entire surface of Itokawa based on high-resolution images (1 pixel ≈ 0.4 m) obtained by the Hayabusa spacecraft. There are 373 boulders larger than 5 m in mean horizontal dimension on the entire surface— 0.393 km 2 —and the number density is nearly 103 /km 2. The cumulative boulder size distribution on the entire surface has a power-index of − 3.1 ± 0.1. For the east and west sides and the head and body portions of Itokawa, the power-index of the size distributions and the number densities <b>of</b> <b>boulders</b> <b>of</b> these areas are thought to be similar from the statistical point of view. A global mapping <b>of</b> <b>boulders</b> shows that there is no apparent correlation in the locations <b>of</b> <b>boulders</b> and craters. The ratio of the total volume <b>of</b> the <b>boulders</b> to the total excavated volume of the craters on Itokawa is ≈ 25 % when only craters larger than 50 m in mean diameter are considered, and this ratio is extremely larger than that on Eros and the Moon, respectively. The origin <b>of</b> <b>boulders</b> on the surface of Itokawa was examined quantitatively by calculating the number <b>of</b> <b>boulders</b> and the size <b>of</b> the largest <b>boulder</b> using a model based on impact cratering experiments. The result indicated that the boulders on the surface of Itokawa cannot solely be the product of craters. Our results suggest that the boulders originated from the disruption of the larger parent body of Itokawa, as has been described in previous papers (Fujiwata et al., Science, 312, 1330 – 1334, 2006; Saito et al., Science, 312, 1341 – 1344, 2006).|$|R
5|$|In {{common with}} most of the Orkney isles, Shapinsay has a bedrock formed from Old Red Sandstone, which is {{approximately}} 400 million years old and was laid down in the Devonian period. These thick deposits accumulated as earlier Silurian rocks, uplifted by the formation of Pangaea, eroded and then deposited into river deltas. The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of these eroding mountains, stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth. The composition of Shapinsay is mostly of the Rousay flagstone group from the Lower Middle Devonian, with some Eday flagstone in the southeast formed in wetter conditions during the later Upper Devonian. The latter is regarded as a better quality building material than the former. At Haco's Ness in the south east corner of the island is a small outcrop of amygdaloidal diabase. The island is overlain with a fertile layer <b>of</b> <b>boulder</b> clay formed during the Pleistocene glaciations.|$|E
5|$|At 08:20 on {{the morning}} of 25 July the Chinese again {{assaulted}} the US Marines on Hill 119 in company strength but were soon halted by American artillery and mortar fire which inflicted heavy losses; skirmishing continued {{for the remainder of the}} day. While no major assaults against Hill 111 occurred, a heavy barrage by the Chinese targeted the position at 11:00. F9F Panthers provided air support to the Marines throughout the day, while American tanks continued to engage Chinese targets in support of the defenders on Hill 111 and Boulder City. Finally, at 13:35 the last of the Chinese infantry were forced off the forward slopes <b>of</b> <b>Boulder</b> City by the US Marines. Chinese casualties were estimated by the Americans to have included another 75 killed and 425 wounded. The Chinese continued to heavily shell the American positions, and by late afternoon 13,500 mortar and artillery rounds had fallen on the sector held by US 7th Marine Regiment. The Americans fired many counter-battery missions in response, firing 36,794 rounds. The ongoing relief of the US 7th Marine Regiment continued throughout the day. Meanwhile, the Australian positions on The Hook were also heavily shelled throughout the day, forcing many of the defenders underground into the network of tunnels then being extended by a team of New Zealand sappers.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In December 2015 the Dawn {{spacecraft}} {{moved into}} the Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (LAMO) around Ceres, encircling the dwarf planet {{at a distance of}} 400 km to the surface below. At this altitude, images of the on-board framing camera have a resolution of 36 meters per pixel, high enough to distinguish large boulders on the surface. Indeed, LAMO images show a multitude <b>of</b> <b>boulders</b> around what seem to be fresh craters. The average life-time <b>of</b> <b>boulders</b> on Dawn's previous target, Vesta, was estimated to be similar to that <b>of</b> Lunar <b>boulders,</b> as may be expected from the basaltic surface composition. The bulk composition of Ceres may be carbonaceous chondrite-like with significant contributions of clays, salt, and water ice. As such, the abundance and distribution <b>of</b> <b>boulders</b> on Ceres may be different from that on Vesta. We mapped, counted, and measured the diameter <b>of</b> <b>boulders</b> over the entire surface of Ceres. Our analysis of the data in combination with crater age estimates may provide clues to the physical nature and composition of the surface...|$|R

25|$|Bradgate Park and its {{surrounding}} areas were heavily overlain in the (geologically) recent past by glacial deposits <b>of</b> <b>Boulder</b> Clay. The Quaternary period includes the last ice age. As the ice melted, some 10,000 years ago, the solid material within the ice settled over the 'natural' rocks below. This material includes unsorted clay and sand particles, small and large pebbles and large stones and boulders. It travelled great distances within the ice sheets and glaciers, so individual rocks, whether on the ground, or within the great lengths of stone walls of the Park, may be local stone, or may be a specimen from northern Britain or even from northern Europe.|$|E
