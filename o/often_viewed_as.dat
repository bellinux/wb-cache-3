5|$|Hannibal's double envelopment at Cannae is <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> {{one of the}} {{greatest}} battlefield maneuvers in history, and is cited as the first successful use of the pincer movement within the Western world to be recorded in detail.|$|E
5|$|Many of the NSS {{agents have}} close {{personal}} ties to one another, {{and the floor}} supervisor and head of security resources, Yang Jung-in (Kim Hye-jin), is no exception. She is <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a dependable and accommodating authority figure and remains a very close friend to colleague Choi Seung-Hee.|$|E

2500|$|Following the 13th Congress, another power {{struggle}} {{with a different}} focus began; this time socio-economic policies were the prime motivators for the struggle. Trotsky, Zinoviev and Kamenev supported rapid industrialisation and a planned economy, while Bukharin, Rykov and Tomsky supported keeping the NEP. Stalin, {{in contrast to the}} others, has <b>often</b> been <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> standing alone; as Jerry F. Hough explained, he has <b>often</b> been <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> [...] "a cynical Machiavellian interested only in power." ...|$|R
5|$|Twentieth-century feminist critics {{embraced the}} work, {{integrating}} {{it into the}} history of the novel and feminist discourse. It is most <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a fictionalized popularization of the Rights of Woman, as an extension of Wollstonecraft's feminist arguments in Rights of Woman, and as autobiographical.|$|E
5|$|Lycian {{architecture}} and sculpture {{are on the}} same level as Greek, but to the Greeks, the Lycians, along with other non-Greek peoples of S.W. Anatolia, were <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> barbarians. From c.550BC Greek pottery is found in quantity in Lycia; the Lion Tomb, Pillar of the Wrestlers, and the pillars at Isinda and Trysa are all distinctly Greek in style with little eastern symbolism.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its range, {{the giant}} otter interacts with {{indigenous}} groups, who often practice traditional hunting and fishing. A study of five indigenous communities in Colombia suggests native {{attitudes toward the}} animal are a threat: the otters are <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a nuisance that interferes with fishing, and are sometimes killed. Even when told {{of the importance of}} the species to ecosystems and the danger of extinction, interviewees showed little interest in continuing to coexist with the species. Schoolchildren, however, had a more positive impression of the animal.|$|E

5|$|Ways of life <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> more rigid, such as {{soldiers}} and religious cultures, frequently have explicit rules regarding hair length. For example, Buddhist monks shave their heads {{as part of}} their order of worship. Similarly, religious men with long hair include the Nazarites of the Hebrew Bible (Samson being a famous example) and the Sikhs. Subservient cultures may view male long hair negatively, and are sometimes detected by their rulers through hair length, {{as was the case with}} the Gaelic Irish under English rule and the Moors under Spanish rule in Medieval Spain.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{key points}} {{stressed}} in this interpretation is that salvation is an individual experience difficult to communicate to outsiders. In his depiction of Camelot, the poet reveals a concern for his society, whose inevitable fall will bring about the ultimate destruction intended by God. Gawain was written {{around the time of}} the Black Death and Peasants' Revolt, events which convinced many people that their world was coming to an apocalyptic end and this belief was reflected in literature and culture. However, other critics see weaknesses in this view, since the Green Knight is ultimately under the control of Morgan le Fay, <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a figure of evil in Camelot tales. This makes the knight's presence as a representative of God problematic.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to turning}} onto Rutgers Street, CR-506 runs along Washington Street {{concurrent}} {{with the northern}} section of Route 7. Though the northern section of Route 7 begins a few blocks south, it is not readily recognized (minimal signing). As CR-506 runs concurrently with it here, and then turns down Rutgers for the short distance that bridges {{the gap between the}} two Route 7 sections, Rutgers/506 is <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> if it continues Route 7, while the short portion of the northern section that lies south of Rutgers is sometimes seen as a spur, even though {{it is part of the}} main route.|$|E

5000|$|... "Lies" [...] (...) {{is a song}} {{performed}} by the South Korean boy band Big Bang. The song was written and composed by rapper G-Dragon. It was released on August 16, 2007 by YG Entertainment as the first single from Big Bang's first extended play Always (2007). It became the group's breakout hit, topping several charts in their home country. The song remains {{one of their most}} critically acclaimed song to date and is <b>often</b> <b>view</b> <b>as</b> one of their signature songs.|$|R
5|$|Bulgarian {{historians have}} had mostly {{negative}} assessments of Ivan Shishman. He is <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> having intruded onto the throne {{due to the}} intrigues {{of his mother and}} thus taking the place of the rightful successor, his elder brother Ivan Sratsimir. This eventually resulted in the division of the country {{on the eve of the}} Ottoman invasion. There are no direct historical sources to suggest any significant attempts by Ivan Shishman to fight off the Turks. The inconsistent policy of Ivan Shishman has been described as revealing his weakness and inability to cope with the situation. His rule, however, was still remembered in the 16th century. In a treaty signed in 1519 between the Ottoman sultan Selim I and Louis II of Hungary, some of the lands in question were referred to as terra cesaris Sysman, “the land of emperor Shishman”.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} Kerala is <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> the ideal {{progressive}} {{leader in the}} women’s rights movement in India among states. Kerala maintains very high relative levels of female literacy and women’s health, as well as greater female inheritance and property rights. For example, a 1998 study conducted by Bina Agarwal found that while only 13% of all women in India with landowning fathers inherited that land as daughters, 24% of such women {{were able to do}} so in the state of Kerala. This is important because it has been shown that measures to improve such access to property and economic independence through channels such as education not only directly improve women’s wellbeing and capabilities, but also reduce their risk of exposure to marital or any sort of domestic violence.|$|E
5|$|Thedas is a {{world in}} which race and class combine to {{determine}} social class. Elves are <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> second-class citizens by humans, while human nobles are treated with respect. Mages, on the other hand, are cloistered by the Chantry: they have access to the Fade, the unconscious realm that is the home of spirits, and a single lapse in vigilance could cause them to be possessed by demons. Apostate mages, who live outside the Chantry's control, are considered extremely dangerous, and the Chantry has a militant wing, the Templars, to seek them out and subdue them by any means necessary. Dwarves live in the Deep Roads, their kingdom a shadow of what it once was before the first Blight. Their society is rooted in tradition and a rigid caste system.|$|E

5|$|After {{his brother}} Virgil was maimed in an ambush and Morgan was assassinated by hidden assailants, the men {{suspected}} of involvement were provided alibis by fellow Cowboys and released without trial. Wyatt {{and his brother}} Warren {{set out on a}} vendetta ride to locate and kill those they felt were responsible. Wyatt has been portrayed in a number of films and books as a fearless Western hero. He is <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> the central character and hero of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, at least in part because {{he was the only one}} who was not wounded or killed. In fact, his brother, Tombstone Marshal and Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp had considerably more experience with weapons and combat as a Union soldier in the Civil War, and in law enforcement as a sheriff, constable, and marshal. As city marshal, Virgil made the decision to disarm the Cowboys in Tombstone and requested Wyatt's assistance. But because Wyatt outlived Virgil and due to a creative biography, Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal published two years after Wyatt's death, Wyatt became famous and the subject of various movies, television shows, biographies and works of fiction.|$|E
