5|$|Late August, 1996– Hurricane Edouard {{produces}} strong swells to the coastline, causing two {{deaths from}} drowning. In addition, one computer model predicts the hurricane would strike near Atlantic City with winds of over 111mph (178km/h) <b>on</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Day.</b> This causes Cape May County officials to contemplate ordering an evacuation for the busiest tourist {{weekend of the}} year, though the order never occurs.|$|E

He raced in over one hundred events in 1963. Andretti won three feature races at two different tracks <b>on</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Day</b> in 1963. He won an afternoon feature at Flemington, New Jersey, and swept twin features at Hatfield, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|The {{threat of}} the storm {{prompted}} hurricane warnings in the southeastern United States, resulting in the evacuation of tourists <b>on</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Day</b> Weekend. Able produced heavy rainfall from Florida through New England, which caused widespread flooding. The city struck by the hurricane was heavily damaged and briefly isolated due to downed power and telephone lines. Overall damage in the United States totaled $2.75million (1952USD, $ USD), mostly from crop damage in South Carolina. Further north, Able produced flooding and gusty winds, which washed out {{a portion of the}} Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.|$|E

5|$|A high {{pressure}} system over New England {{resulted in the}} possibility that Edouard would track {{to the west and}} strike the United States. One computer model predicted the hurricane would strike near Atlantic City, New Jersey with winds of over 111mph (178km/h) <b>on</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Day.</b> This caused Cape May County officials to contemplate ordering an evacuation for the busiest tourist weekend of the year, though an evacuation never occurred. Due to the possibility for a landfall on the East Coast of the United States, officials at the National Hurricane Center issued Tropical Storm and Hurricane Watches and Warnings from Cape Lookout, North Carolina to Eastport, Maine at various times. Tropical storm warnings existed from North Carolina to Watch Hill, Rhode Island and {{from the mouth of the}} Merrimack River to the United States/Canada border, while hurricane warnings existed from Watch Hill, Rhode Island to Merrimack River, Massachusetts. Hurricane watches were also issued for the tropical storm warning area.|$|E

Lara Flynn Boyle filmed scenes from The Temp in the South Park Blocks in 1992, and The Hunted was filmed partially in the South Park Blocks in 2003, including a crash scene by Benicio del Toro.|$|E
5|$|Sheridan Road {{was created}} in the early 20th century {{connecting}} Chicago with Fort Sheridan north of the city. Both the road and the fort were named in honor of Philip Sheridan, Union general during the Civil War. Sheridan, who served as colonel of the 2nd Michigan Cavalry in 1862, was later promoted to the rank of major general during the war. The Greater Sheridan Road Association started to promote an extension of the road south to St. Louis and north through Wisconsin and Michigan to end at Fort Wilkins in Copper Harbor by 1922. The roadway followed US41's predecessor, M-15, and included numerous road signs bearing Sheridan's silhouette mounted on his horse Rienzi. Towns along the way were encouraged to rename city streets as Sheridan Road <b>on</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Day</b> 1923. The road was promoted until the Great Depression in the 1930s. All that remains are signs in Menominee noting that First Street was once Sheridan Road.|$|E

5|$|Eldred did {{not have}} a troop board of review, a review by the adult troop leaders to ensure eligibility. Instead, Eldred had a {{thorough}} National Board of Review consisting of West, Baden-Powell, Ernest Thompson Seton, Daniel Carter Beard, Arthur R. Forbush, and Wilbert E. Longfellow, who wrote in the Handbook for Boys on life-saving and swimming. At the time there had still not been a council-level system for Eagle Scouts boards of review. Largely due to delays caused by Baden-Powell's visit, the National Court of Honor did not convene until March 29, 1912. A press announcement was released on or about April 10, 1912, leading to a century of confusion wherein it was believed Eldred's Board of Review had been held in April. West informed Eldred of his Eagle award in a letter dated August 21, 1912. Another reason for the delays was that the Boy Scouts of America felt no one would ever earn the Eagle Scout award and at the time of Eldred's Board of Review, the Eagle Scout medal had not yet been designed. This letter also informed Eldred of the delay in the medal, caused {{by the fact that the}} design of the Eagle Scout medal had not been finalized. Eldred was presented Eagle Scout <b>on</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Day,</b> September 2, 1912, becoming the first to earn Scouting's highest rank, just two years after the founding of the BSA itself.|$|E
5|$|Stengel, hired {{only days}} before spring training, had but a limited {{opportunity}} to shape his new ballclub. The Dodgers quickly settled into sixth place, {{where they would}} end the season. Stengel, in later years, enjoyed discussing one 1934 game in Philadelphia's Baker Bowl: with Dodger pitcher Boom-Boom Beck ineffective, Stengel {{went out to the}} mound to take out the angry pitcher, who, instead of giving Stengel the baseball, threw it into right field, where it hit the metal wall with a loud noise. The right fielder, Hack Wilson, lost in thought, heard the boom, assumed the ball had been hit by a batter, and ran to retrieve it and throw it to the infield, to be met by general laughter. Stengel got the last laughs on the Giants as well. The Giants, six games ahead of the Cardinals <b>on</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Day,</b> dissipated that lead, and with two games in the season were tied with St. Louis—with the final two games against Brooklyn at the Polo Grounds, games played in front of raucous crowds, who well remembered Terry's comments. Brooklyn won both games, while the Cardinals won their two games against the Cincinnati Reds, and won the pennant. Richard Bak, in his biography of Stengel, noted that the victories over the Terry-led Giants represented personal vindication for the Dodger manager.|$|E
