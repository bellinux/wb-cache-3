5|$|Though Han wooden {{structures}} decayed, some Han-dynasty ruins made <b>of</b> <b>brick,</b> stone, and rammed earth remain intact. This includes stone pillar-gates, brick tomb chambers, rammed-earth city walls, rammed-earth and brick beacon towers, rammed-earth {{sections of the}} Great Wall, rammed-earth platforms where elevated halls once stood, and two rammed-earth castles in Gansu. The ruins of rammed-earth walls that once surrounded the capitals Chang'an and Luoyang still stand, along with their drainage systems <b>of</b> <b>brick</b> arches, ditches, and ceramic water pipes. Monumental stone pillar-gates, twenty-nine of which survive from the Han period, formed entrances of walled enclosures at shrine and tomb sites. These pillars feature artistic imitations of wooden and ceramic building components such as roof tiles, eaves, and balustrades.|$|E
5|$|As far {{as can be}} determined, between arches 2 to 21, {{the outer}} facing of the {{superstructure}} consists of four layers <b>of</b> <b>brick,</b> followed by layers of rough stonemasonry bound with mortar. In contrast, between arches 22 and 26, {{as well as in}} both ramps on either end, the facing consists of ashlar blocks. The two repaired arches 27a and 27b are differentiated from the earlier work through the use of smaller unworked stones and the incorporation of irregularly placed brick tiles. In arch 26, the lower side of the arch still features a projecting bearing used for the placement of the falsework.|$|E

5|$|Brettingham was {{commissioned}} in 1742 to redesign Langley Hall, a mansion standing {{in its own}} parkland in South Norfolk. His design {{was very much in}} the Palladian style of Holkham, though much smaller: a large principal central block linked to two flanking secondary wings by short corridors. The corner towers, while similar to those later designed by Brettingham at Euston Hall, were the work of a later owner and architect. The neoclassical entrance lodges were a later addition, by Sir John Soane. In 1743, Brettingham began work on the construction of Hanworth Hall, Norfolk, also in the Palladian style, with a five-bay facade <b>of</b> <b>brick</b> with the centre three bays projected with a pediment.|$|E
5|$|Businesses in Chinatown {{attempted}} to raise $200,000 {{to build an}} 11-story bell tower pagoda {{at the south end}} of the park. The tower was planned to be constructed <b>of</b> <b>brick</b> and stone with a hollow interior. While visitors would not have been able to climb the structure, they would have been able to walk through an entrance at its base. Chicago Sun-Times writer Lee Bey believed the bell tower to be the park's most important feature. Despite the Taiwanese government making an early commitment to help finance the tower, it was never constructed.|$|E
5|$|Denmark's first churches {{from the}} 9th century were built of timber {{and have not}} survived. Hundreds of stone churches in the Romanesque style {{were built in the}} 12th and 13th centuries. They had a flat-ceilinged nave and chancel with small rounded windows and round arches. Granite {{boulders}} and limestone were initially the preferred building materials, but after brick production reached Denmark {{in the middle of the}} 12th century, brick quickly became the material of choice. Among the finest examples <b>of</b> <b>brick</b> Romanesque buildings are St. Bendt's Church in Ringsted (c. 1170) and the unique Church of Our Lady in Kalundborg (c. 1200) with its five tall towers.|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{physical}} properties and mechanical properties of Oil Palm Trunk (OPT) fibre and Oil Palm Fruit Bunches (OPFB) fibre reinforced laterite bricks. For comparison purposes, the properties such as dimension, density, water absorption and the compressive strength of both types <b>of</b> <b>bricks</b> were determined. The effects of the incorporation of various amounts of fibres on the above properties were analysed. The tests were carried out according to BS 3821 : 1985 for clay bricks. The samples were pressed at the factory Majpadu Bricks Sdn. Bhd., Malaysia and tested at the Material Testing Laboratory, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Malaysia. The findings of this research were, firstly, the dimension <b>of</b> <b>bricks</b> content with OPFB fibres were less accurate than bricks with OPT fibres. Secondly, the density <b>of</b> <b>bricks</b> with OPFB fibres was higher than the density <b>of</b> <b>bricks</b> with OPT fibres. Thirdly, in compressive strength <b>of</b> the <b>bricks</b> with OPFB fibres was higher than bricks with OPT fibres, with the maximum fibre content identified as 3 percent fibres. Finally, the water absorption <b>of</b> <b>bricks</b> with OPFB fibres was lower than the water absorption <b>of</b> <b>bricks</b> with OPT fibres. It can be concluded that the bricks with OPFB fibres had better physical and mechanical properties than bricks with OPT fibres. </p...|$|R

5|$|During {{the first}} years border fortifications inside the city mostly {{consisted}} <b>of</b> <b>brick</b> walls with a top made of barbed wire. Clay bricks and concrete slabs were used for construction. Further obstacles of barbed wire and upstate walls delimitated the East and at some places, like Bernauer Straße, bricked-up buildings formed the boundary line. The buildings were situated on East-Berlin territory, whereas the pavement {{in front of the}} houses belonged to West-Berlin. In many places safety installations of West-Berlin's outer ring consisted of metal fences and barbed wire barriers. Technologically advanced upgrading took place later on and only in 1975 L-shaped concrete segments that were known from the fall of the Wall were added.|$|E

40|$|This diploma thesis {{focuses on}} the {{weathering}} <b>of</b> firing <b>bricks</b> used for construction of the walls at the Regional Maternity Hospital U Apolináře in Prague. This wall shows significant marks of weathering, such as black crusts of gypsum on the original bricks surface, blistering, spalling and powdering in the worst cases. The poor quality <b>of</b> the <b>bricks</b> {{is caused by a}} low firing temperature (aprox. 800 - 900 řC). This leads to a lack of pores bigger than 3 μm, which have positive influence on high performance <b>of</b> <b>bricks</b> against freeze-thaw cycles and effect of water soluble salts. This thesis aims to find the source of raw material for production <b>of</b> <b>bricks,</b> determination <b>of</b> their mineralogical composition and their basic geotechnical survey, as well as determination of weathering forms and their intensity by detailed field study of the wall. The relationship between properties <b>of</b> <b>bricks</b> and weathering forms will be studied by optical microscopy, XR diffraction, which allows to estimate mineralogal composition <b>of</b> <b>bricks</b> and their firing temperature.
