25|$|Oxidative {{cleavage}} of olefins by <b>ozonolysis,</b> potassium permanganate, or potassium dichromate.|$|E
25|$|Ozone is a reagent in many organic {{reactions}} {{in the laboratory}} and in industry. <b>Ozonolysis</b> is the cleavage of an alkene to carbonyl compounds.|$|E
25|$|Alkenes can be oxidatively cleaved by ozone, in {{a process}} called <b>ozonolysis,</b> giving alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and {{carboxylic}} acids, depending on the second step of the workup.|$|E
25|$|The {{process can}} be {{extended}} to give to aldehydes in the Lemieux–Johnson oxidation, which uses periodate to achieve diol cleavage and to regenerate the catalytic loading of OsO4. This process is equivalent to that of <b>ozonolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thiourea is {{also used}} in the reductive workup of <b>ozonolysis</b> to give {{carbonyl}} compounds. Dimethyl sulfide is also an effective reagent for this reaction, but it is highly volatile (b.p.) and has an obnoxious odor whereas thiourea is odorless and conveniently non-volatile (reflecting its polarity).|$|E
25|$|Asymmetric allylboration {{demonstrates}} another useful {{application of}} organoboranes in carbon–carbon bond formation. In this example from Nicolaou's {{synthesis of the}} epothilones, asymmetric allylboration (using an allylborane derived from chiral alpha-pinene) is {{used in conjunction with}} TBS protection and <b>ozonolysis.</b> Overall, this provides a two-carbon homologation sequence that delivers the required acetogenin sequence.|$|E
25|$|Usually <b>ozonolysis</b> {{is carried}} out in a {{solution}} of dichloromethane, at a temperature of −78oC. After a sequence of cleavage and rearrangement, an organic ozonide is formed. With reductive workup (e.g. zinc in acetic acid or dimethyl sulfide), ketones and aldehydes will be formed, with oxidative workup (e.g. aqueous or alcoholic hydrogen peroxide), carboxylic acids will be formed.|$|E
25|$|In {{combination}} with sodium periodate, OsO4 {{is used for}} the oxidative cleavage of alkenes (Lemieux-Johnson oxidation) when the periodate serves both to cleave the diol formed by dihydroxylation, and to reoxidize the OsO3 back to OsO4. The net transformation is identical to that produced by <b>ozonolysis.</b> Below an example from the total synthesis of Isosteviol.|$|E
25|$|The {{ethyl ester}} of propionic acid (1) was {{brominated}} and then converted to the Wittig reagent using triphenylphosphine. Aldehyde 6 {{was obtained from}} allyl alcohol (4) by protection as the tert-butyldiphenylsilyl ether (5) followed by <b>ozonolysis.</b> Wittig reagent 3 and aldehyde 6 reacted in a Wittig reaction to give unsaturated ester 7, which was deprotected to give dienophile 8 (Scheme 1, compound 1).|$|E
25|$|When inhaled, ozone {{reacts with}} {{compounds}} lining the lungs to form specific, cholesterol-derived metabolites that {{are thought to}} facilitate the build-up and pathogenesis of atherosclerotic plaques (a form of heart disease). These metabolites have been confirmed as naturally occurring in human atherosclerotic arteries and are categorized into a class of secosterols termed atheronals, generated by <b>ozonolysis</b> of cholesterol's double bond to form a 5,6 secosterol {{as well as a}} secondary condensation product via aldolization.|$|E
25|$|Alkenes are {{oxidized}} with a {{large number}} of oxidizing agents. In the presence of oxygen, alkenes burn with a bright flame to produce carbon dioxide and water. Catalytic oxidation with oxygen or the reaction with percarboxylic acids yields epoxides. Reaction with ozone in <b>ozonolysis</b> leads to the breaking of the double bond, yielding two aldehydes or ketones. Reaction with concentrated, hot KMnO4 (or other oxidizing salts) in an acidic solution will yield ketones or carboxylic acids.|$|E
25|$|Polymer {{oxidation}} {{has caused}} accidents involving medical devices. One {{of the oldest}} known failure modes is ozone cracking caused by chain scission when ozone gas attacks susceptible elastomers, such as natural rubber and nitrile rubber. They possess double bonds in their repeat units which are cleaved during <b>ozonolysis.</b> Cracks in fuel lines can penetrate the bore of the tube and cause fuel leakage. If cracking occurs in the engine compartment, electric sparks can ignite the gasoline and can cause a serious fire. In medical use degradation of polymers can lead to changes of physical and chemical characteristics of implantable devices.|$|E
500|$|They {{are widely}} used to prevent the {{oxidative}} degradation of polymers such as rubbers, plastics and adhesives that causes a loss of strength and flexibility in these materials. Polymers containing double bonds in their main chains, such as natural rubber and polybutadiene, are especially susceptible to oxidation and <b>ozonolysis.</b> They can be protected by antiozonants. Solid polymer products start to crack on exposed surfaces as the material degrades and the chains break. The mode of cracking varies between oxygen and ozone attack, the former causing a [...] "crazy paving" [...] effect, while ozone attack produces deeper cracks aligned {{at right angles to}} the tensile strain in the product. [...] Oxidation and UV degradation are also frequently linked, mainly because UV radiation creates free radicals by bond breakage. The free radicals then react with oxygen to produce peroxy radicals which cause yet further damage, often in a chain reaction. Other polymers susceptible to oxidation include polypropylene and polyethylene. The former is more sensitive owing to the presence of secondary carbon atoms present in every repeat unit. Attack occurs at this point because the free radical formed is more stable than one formed on a primary carbon atom. Oxidation of polyethylene tends to occur at weak links in the chain, such as branch points in low-density polyethylene.|$|E
2500|$|The {{starting}} {{material for the}} synthesis of ring C [...] was chiral (+)-camphorquinone 38 [...] which {{can be converted to}} the acetoxy trimethylcyclohexene carboxylic acid ester 39 [...] by addition of trifluoroborane in acetic anhydride, a reaction pioneered by Manasse & Samuel in 1902. Ester hydrolysis to carboxylic acid 40 and amidation to amide 41 was followed by <b>ozonolysis</b> to peroxide 42 that was reduced to succinimide 43 by zinc and methanol. treatment with methanolic hydrochloric acid gave lactam 44 and pyrolysis gave the complete C ring 45.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{protective}} {{group in}} 26 (acetal, acid hydrolysis) was reconverted to the ketone in 27. The monooxime 28 (at the more hindered ketone group) was synthesised from the dioxime by selective hydrolysis (nitrous acid / acetic acid [...] ). The new nitrogen atom {{is also the}} second nitrogen atom required for the AD building block. Both the cyclopentene ring and the cyclohexenone ring were oxidized next in an <b>ozonolysis</b> (ozone) forming triketone 29, an aldol condensation of the 1,5-dicarbonyl unit (pyrrolidine acetate) formed cyclohexene 30 with tosylation of the oxime group, a second oxidation with periodic acid cleaves the cyclohexene ring and diazomethane esterifies the resulting carboxylic acid group in 31. A Beckmann rearrangement (methanol, sodium polystyrene sulfonate 2 hrs, 170°C) took place next to lactam 32 (not isolated) which reacted further to the tetracycle 33 called alpha-corrnorsterone in an amine-carbonyl condensation - aldol condensation cascade. This compound resisted [...] ring-opening of the lactam group due to incorrect stereochemistry of the propionic ester side-chain. The alpha compound was therefore converted its epimer 34 by first equilibrating in excess base followed by reacidifiying and diazomethane treatment. This epimer was then converted to the 35 by the simultaneous action of methanol and thiophenol. This ensured the differentiation of what will become the imidazole tail. [...] The [...] <b>Ozonolysis</b> gave aldehyde 36 with ammonia converting the thioester into an amide group and aldehyde reduction (sodium borohydride) followed by mesylation and bromination (lithium bromide) gave the bromide 37 with conversion of the amide group into a nitrile group as the completed AD section.|$|E
2500|$|Giardia lamblia {{infection}} {{can occur}} through ingestion of dormant microbial cysts in contaminated water or food, {{or by the}} fecal–oral route (through poor hygiene practices). The cyst can survive for weeks to months in cold water, so can be present in contaminated wells and water systems, especially stagnant water sources, such as naturally occurring ponds, storm water storage systems, and even clean-looking mountain streams. [...] Giardia lamblia is a microscopic parasite that causes the diarrheal illness known as giardiasis. Can also be found on surfaces, soil, food, or water that has been contaminated with feces from infected humans or animals. They may also occur in city reservoirs and persist after water treatment, as the cysts are resistant to conventional water treatment methods, such as chlorination and <b>ozonolysis.</b> Zoonotic transmission is also possible, so Giardia infection is a concern for people camping in the wilderness or swimming in contaminated streams or lakes, especially the artificial lakes formed by beaver dams (hence the popular name for giardiasis, [...] "beaver fever").|$|E
