5|$|By {{tradition}} dated {{back to the}} Byzantine era, {{the king}} was regarded by the Church {{as part of her}} head. On the issue of Church's Autocephaly and his role as king within the Church, Otto was <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> arcana of Orthodox Church doctrine and popular discontent with his Roman Catholicism (while the Queen was Protestant).|$|E
5|$|July 1940to October 1943: A {{total ban}} on air operations, and {{a release of}} interned German {{aircraft}} and pilots, resulting from the encirclement of Swiss territory by the Axis, {{the implementation of the}} Réduit strategy, and recognition that the Air Force would be <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Germans in a sustained campaign.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine {{victory was}} {{ultimately}} a pyrrhic one, as the devastating {{impact of the}} war left the Byzantines in much weakened state. Within a few years both empires were <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> onslaught of the Arabs who had become newly united by Islam, ultimately leading to the Muslim conquest of Persia in 644 and {{the fall of the}} Sasanian dynasty in 651.|$|E

Through Noguchi, she befriended the industrial designer Isamu Kenmochi, who wrote that, [...] "Her work has great vision, grandeur rather than beauty: <b>overwhelming</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> vigorous power flowing forth from within ... poetry wrung from the body.' [...] She had solo exhibitions in Kyoto and Tokyo.|$|R

5|$|The insurgents were poorly armed, and {{eventually}} were <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> tsarist regular military. Most of the barricades fell by 24 June; {{the last of}} the barricades (in the Źródliska park and Wschodnia street) were captured by Russian troops by the end of 24 June or by midday on 25 June (sources vary), but unrest—including occasional shots at police or military patrols—would continue for days afterwards.|$|E
5|$|At this time, Ueno Hikoma and Horie Kuwajirō also {{received}} photographic instruction from Rossier. Apparently Ueno had {{originally intended to}} learn not only the practice of photography but also the manufacture of cameras. The encounter with Rossier seems to have convinced Ueno to pursue photography as a career, {{but he was so}} <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> technology of the camera that he quickly dropped the notion of making one himself. Within a few months, he and Horie had purchased a French camera and chemicals, thereafter launching their independent photographic careers.|$|E
5|$|In late 1993 Shonekan's {{caretaker}} {{regime was}} <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> military coup of General Sani Abacha, who used military force {{on a wide}} scale to suppress the continuing civilian unrest. He shifted money to offshore accounts in western European banks and defeated coup plots by bribing army generals. In 1995 the government hanged environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa on trumped-up charges {{in the deaths of}} four Ogoni elders. Lawsuits under the American Alien Tort Statute against Royal Dutch Shell and Brian Anderson, the head of Shell's Nigerian operation, settled out of court with Shell continuing to deny liability.|$|E

5|$|In the whaleboat, Melville had, like De Long, ridden out {{the storm}} {{by means of a}} sea anchor. The boat's course was far to the south of De Long's; they finally reached land at one of the main mouths of the Lena, and were able to {{navigate}} upriver. Within a few days they encountered a native fishing camp, and by September 25 had reached the settlement of Arrhu. Chipp's cutter never reached land; <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> storm, it presumably foundered, with the loss of all eight on board.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Macedonian phalanx on {{the left}} flank engaged the Spartan phalanx and mercenaries. During the initial assault, the Macedonian phalanx gave a {{considerable}} amount of ground before its weight drove back the Spartan phalanx. The Spartans, <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> deeper ranks of Macedonian phalanx, were routed, but Cleomenes managed to escape {{with a small group of}} men. The battle was very costly for the Spartans; most of their army was routed with only 200 of the 6,000 Spartans that fought surviving the battle.|$|E

She expresses her distaste about growing older than her boyfriend Edward Cullen, a human with vampire powers, who stopped aging {{physically}} at seventeen. Despite her lack of enthusiasm, Edward's adoptive family host Bella a birthday party. While unwrapping a gift, Bella receives a paper cut. Edward's brother, Jasper, becomes <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> scent of Bella's blood, and attempts to attack her. Realizing the danger {{that he and his}} family pose to Bella, Edward ends their relationship, and the Cullens leave Forks, Washington.|$|E

2500|$|Iran is a seismically active zone, lying {{between the}} {{converging}} Eurasian and Arabian Plates.

5|$|The Egyptians, {{under heavy}} and {{effective}} {{fire from the}} Israelis inside the bunkers, ceased entering the fort. The Sa'iqa company to the east, under concentrated Israeli tank fire and aerial bombardment, was finally <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Israeli reinforcements, which proceeded towards the fort, opening fire on the main force. Consequently, all Egyptian forces east of the fort attempted to retreat through the marshes. The Israelis attempted to hamper the retreat by dropping smoke capsules over the area from four A-4 Skyhawks. The lack of visibility caused injuries as men tripped and were trampled during the retreat through the marshes.|$|E
5|$|The Gengshi Emperor (r.23–25 AD), a {{descendant}} of Emperor Jing (r.157–141 BC), attempted to restore the Han dynasty and occupied Chang'an as his capital. However, he was <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Red Eyebrow rebels who deposed, assassinated, and replaced him with the puppet monarch Liu Penzi. Emperor Gengshi's brother Liu Xiu, known posthumously as Emperor Guangwu (r.25–57 AD), after distinguishing himself at the Battle of Kunyang in 23 AD, was urged to succeed Gengshi as emperor.|$|E
5|$|The four group winners, Argentina, Yugoslavia, Uruguay and the United States, {{moved to}} the semi-finals. The two semi-final matches saw {{identical}} scores. The first semi-final was played between the USA and Argentina on a rain-drenched pitch. The United States team, which featured six British-born players, lost midfielder Raphael Tracy after ten minutes to a broken leg as the match became violent. A Monti goal halfway through the first half gave Argentina a 1–0 half-time lead. In the second half, {{the strength of the}} United States team was <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pace of the Argentinian attacks, the match finishing 6–1 to Argentina.|$|E

5|$|The hostage-takers {{and their}} cause were largely {{forgotten}} after the Iran–Iraq War broke {{out later that}} year and the hostage crisis in Tehran continued until January 1981. Nonetheless, the operation brought the SAS to the public eye {{for the first time}} and bolstered the reputation of Thatcher. The SAS was quickly <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> number of applications it received from people inspired by the operation and experienced greater demand for its expertise from foreign governments. The building, having suffered major damage from a fire that broke out during the assault, was not reopened as the Iranian embassy until 1993.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1967, North Vietnamese units {{increased}} the tempo of their operations around Phou Pha Thi, and by 1968 several attacks were launched against Lima Site 85. In the final assault on 10March1968, elements of the VPA 41st Special Forces Battalion attacked the facility, {{with support from the}} VPA 766th Regiment and one Pathet Lao battalion. The Hmong and Thai forces that were defending the facility were <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> combined North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces.|$|E
5|$|After {{the three-year}} {{transition}} period ended with Nasser's official assumption of power, his domestic and independent foreign policies increasingly {{collided with the}} regional interests of the UK and France. The latter condemned his strong support for Algerian independence, and the UK's Eden government was agitated by Nasser's campaign against the Baghdad Pact. In addition, Nasser's adherence to neutralism regarding the Cold War, recognition of communist China, and arms deal with the Eastern bloc alienated the United States. On 19 July 1956, the US and UK abruptly withdrew their offer to finance construction of the Aswan Dam, citing concerns that Egypt's economy would be <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> project.|$|E

5|$|A few {{physicists}} {{persisted in}} developing semiclassical models in which electromagnetic radiation is not quantized, but matter appears {{to obey the}} laws of quantum mechanics. Although the evidence from chemical and physical experiments {{for the existence of}} photons was <b>overwhelming</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 1970s, this evidence could not be considered as absolutely definitive; since it relied on the interaction of light with matter, and a sufficiently complete theory of matter could in principle account for the evidence. Nevertheless, all semiclassical theories were refuted definitively in the 1970s and 1980s by photon-correlation experiments. Hence, Einstein's hypothesis that quantization is a property of light itself is considered to be proven.|$|R

5|$|Although {{his suicide}} is often {{linked to the}} Foundation’s {{financial}} difficulties, the letter clearly shows Favaloro <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> corruption of the health system and feeling {{that he could not}} fight against this powerful organization. In some parts of the letter, he refers to himself as “Don Quijote” in his lonely battle against the giants. Aggravating this situation was that Favaloro had never recovered from the death of his wife in 1998. Following her death, he had resolved to marry one of his longtime colleagues and coauthors, Diana Truden; she lived with Favaloro during his final days and was in his Palermo neighborhood house when he committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 6 April, the JNA {{launched}} a fresh attack towards Kupres and Kupreška Vrata, leaving {{the bulk of}} the 13th Partisan Brigade in reserve and employing the rest of the force at the plateau. The artillery was used so intensely that the 30th Partisan Division had to request resupply of its depleted stocks. The most effective part of the advance was the 9th Tank Company, which quickly pushed through the defensive positions, bypassed Zlosela and reached Olovo. In contrast, the Bosnian Croat TO command in Kupres was <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> complexity of the situation and could not track which units it had at its disposal—even losing track of units physically near the command post.|$|E
5|$|Bill Fulcher supplanted Bud Carson. Fulcher {{appeared}} to be the right choice but quit after two seasons, <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Tech fan base. Fulcher's tenure included a terrible feud with Eddie McAshan, which peaked before the 1972 UGA game. McAshan had requested additional tickets for the game so that his family could attend. Fulcher refused the ticket request and McAshan sat out of practice in protest. Fulcher responded by suspending the quarterback for the UGA game and the upcoming Liberty Bowl. The story exploded on the national scene when Jesse Jackson attended the UGA game, allowing McAshan to sit with him outside of the stadium in protest.|$|E
