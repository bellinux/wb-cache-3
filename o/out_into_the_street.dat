5|$|The {{woman is}} {{revealed}} to be a genie. Stokes is angry that he wasted his first two wishes; Stokes had previously wished for his boss to stop talking (which caused Gilmore's mouth to disappear) and for a boat. The boat, however, was not placed in water and Stokes is still forced {{to pay taxes on}} it. The genie suggests that Anson should give his physically handicapped brother the ability to walk as his third wish; but he instead wishes for the ability to be turned invisible. Anson, now invisible, runs <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and is killed by a truck as he crosses the road.|$|E

Kathy Barnes (Sarah Jane Buckley) begins to suspect an affair between Zoe and Mike, and throws all Zoe's clothes <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Mike then asks Kathy to move out. He and Zoe sleep together, unknowingly {{recorded}} by Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson), who exposes them. Sarah lashes out at Mike and Zoe. She flaunts her older boyfriend Roger Kiddle (Quentin Tibble) in Mike's face, which backfires when Roger makes a pass at Zoe and they become an official couple. Sarah is able to forgive Zoe, and comforts her when she has a pregnancy scare. Mike is very upset about the idea of Zoe being pregnant.|$|E

Lou finally realizes that his son actually has been kidnapped and heads out to look for him. Now at Lee's house, Crystal asks Lee to help stop the kidnapping scheme, {{but he does not}} comply. Crystal goes to Dean's house for help, where she finds him hallucinating about Troy's death and finally expressing his grief. Meanwhile, a paranoid Lee, encouraged by Billy, tries to kill Charlie Bratley to avoid being caught, but Charlie fights back and slices the knife through Billy's eye. Billy runs <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> screaming in pain, and is hit by Lou's police car.|$|E

5|$|Waters {{includes}} a historical {{reference to the}} medical profession starting to acknowledge and identify female homosexuality in the 19th century when a friend of Diana's named Dickie reads aloud during a party from a medical text describing the histories of several acknowledged lesbians, including Dickie's own. One story discussed among the wealthy women at the party is about {{a young woman with}} a large clitoris, which they consider congenital in lower-class women. They attempt to prove their point with Diana's maid Zena, but Nan prevents this humiliation, which precipitates her final rift with Diana. Using Dickie's book to strike Nan across the face, Diana gives her a black eye and bloody cheek before throwing her <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> with Zena. Nan goes to Florence's house, which is filled with socialist literature. Although Diana is a supporter of women's suffrage, she discourages Nan from reading such literature, confiscating any political material Nan picks up. In contrast, Nan feels hopelessly uninformed when Florence and her friends engage in heated political debates. She asks questions, but feels stupid about not knowing the answers. Florence introduces her to the writings of Walt Whitman, Eleanor Marx, and Edward Carpenter, which they sexualise by using as an introduction to intimacy.|$|E
25|$|The Prince {{then goes}} into the streets and into the Swank Bar, a 1970s-style disco, in Scenes Five and Six. Here is where the choreography veers from {{classical}} ballet, with jazz forms and modern dance dominating. The Prince gets into a fight with sailors at the bar, and he is thrown <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> In Scene Seven, he sees the Girlfriend being paid off by von Rothbart, and he is totally shattered {{to discover that the}} only person who appeared to love him is a fake. This increases his desperation and he vows to kill himself.|$|E
25|$|Captain George Walling of the Metropolitans was {{assigned}} to carry {{out one of the}} warrants. He arrived at City Hall by himself and was allowed to speak with Mayor Wood in his private office. Learning the purpose of his visit, Wood refused to accompany Walling, who then attempted to take him out of the building by force. Over 300 Municipal officers were stationed at City Hall, and Walling was stopped and thrown <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> He attempted several times to re-enter, arguing with Captain Abraham Ackerman, until the arrival of Captains Jacob Sebring and Coroner Perry, leading fifty Metropolitans, to serve the second warrant.|$|E

25|$|One {{morning in}} 1948, soon after Burma gained her {{independence}} from Britain, however, the Kyipwa Yay Press in Mandalay was dynamited to rubble by government troops who were angry that the Ludu couple {{appeared to be}} sympathetic to the Communists. This {{was a time when}} regime change happened quite often with the city falling into the hands, in turn, of the Karen rebels, Communists and the new Socialist government under U Nu. The entire family, including two pregnant women, was thrown <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> lined up and was about to be gunned down when a number of monks and locals successfully intervened to save their lives.|$|E

She went to New York City and became involved with Saul Lapidus. On Sept. 9, 1977, Maddux returned to the apartment she had once shared with Einhorn to collect her things (Einhorn had reportedly threatened to throw her things <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> as trash), and was never seen again. Several weeks later, the Philadelphia police questioned Einhorn about her disappearance. He claimed that Maddux had gone out to the neighborhood co-op to buy some tofu and sprouts, and never returned.|$|E
25|$|On that occasion, Reles dragged Irving {{from the}} hallway of his home <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Reles beat, kicked, and then shot Irving {{numerous}} times, killing him. Two months later, Reles met Meyer Shapiro {{on the street and}} killed him by shooting him in the face. Another three years elapsed before Reles finally got the last Shapiro brother, William. William was abducted off the street and taken to a gang hideout. Once there, he was beaten nearly to death, stuffed into a sack, and driven out to the Canarsie section of Brooklyn and buried. Before the gang could finish burying William, a passerby spotted them and they had to flee the scene. William Shapiro's body was exhumed shortly thereafter, and after being autopsied it was determined that he had been buried alive.|$|E

25|$|Caseros {{was used}} as a place to {{dismantle}} stolen cars during the 1990s. At the time there was also a mysterious episode in which two inmates were allowed <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> for a night to go on a robbing spree. They shot and killed someone {{in the course of the}} night, and their faces were caught on camera. The next morning they were safely back in their cells, but the police identified them through the videotapes and began to investigate. Within the next three weeks, one of the inmates was found dead in his cell, apparently as a result of suicide. But his fellow inmates doubted the possibility of suicide, since he hadn't shown any signs of being suicidal. The guards who had let them out for a night in exchange for a cut of the booty were obvious suspects. Eventually all the guards were arrested as a part of the investigation, and held in custody for nearly a year. One guard was tried and found guilty of murder, receiving a sentence of twenty years in prison.|$|E
25|$|One {{morning in}} 1948, soon after Burma gained her {{independence}} from the British, however, the Kyipwa Yay Press in Mandalay was dynamited to rubble by government troops who were angry that the Ludu couple appeared to be sympathetic to the Communists. This {{was a time when}} regime change happened quite often with the city falling into the hands, in turn, of the Karen rebels, Communists and the new nationalist government under U Nu. The entire family, including two pregnant women, was thrown <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> lined up and was about to be gunned down when a number of monks and locals successfully intervened to save their lives. Although only an ardent reformist, if left-leaning, and recognised as such from the early days by his friends and colleagues, the accusing finger of being a Communist by successive governments was never to leave him, even when many in the ruling party of the day, including Ne Win, knew him personally. Hardline leftists, on the other hand, regarded him as weak and indecisive, lacking in revolutionary commitment.|$|E
25|$|Before {{releasing}} the jury for deliberation, Judge Learned Hand altered {{the charges against}} the defendants and attempted to preface the jury of their constitutional duties. Hand dismissed all the charges against Josephine Bell, and dismissed the first count – “conspiracy to cause mutiny and refusal of duty”—against the remaining defendants. Prior to {{releasing the}} jurors, Judge Hand stated, “I {{do not have to}} remind you that every man has the right to have such economic, philosophic or religious opinions as seem to him best, whether they be socialist, anarchistic or atheistic.” After deliberating from Thursday afternoon to Saturday, the jury returned with two decisions. First, the jury was unable to come to a unanimous decision. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the jurors seeking to convict the defendants blamed one juror for being unable to conform to the majority opinion, as he was also a socialist and, consequently, un-American. Not only did the other eleven jurors demand the prosecutor to levy charges against the lone juror) but moved to drag the socialist supporter <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and lynch him. Judge Hand, given the uproar, declared a mistrial.|$|E

25|$|However, the Sotenos {{are best}} known for Tree of Life sculptures. The {{time it takes to}} {{complete}} a Tree depends on size and complexity, anywhere from a day to two months of 15-hour workdays. Sizes can range from twenty centimeters to over a meter in height. The sculptures are made from the reddish and yellow clays found in a nearby community called Ocotitlán. The mined clay is left out to dry and the clumps broken up, sometimes but putting them <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> for cars to roll over. As needed, the powdered clay is mixed with water and a flower called “tule” to soften and whiten the clay. The small details may be made with molds, but a number of artisans in the family, including Oscar, prefer to do it all by hand. Details and branches may be attached or reinforced by wire, but both Oscar and Tiburcio avoid the use of wire as it can break over time. The piece is carefully dried and fired. The largest trees may be fired in separate parts and in stages. Then they painted with anilines, natural pigments, acrylics and sometimes enamel.|$|E
500|$|On 13June 1917, P.C. Alfred Smith, {{an officer}} of the Metropolitan Police, was patrolling Central Street in Finsbury, {{approximately}} [...] directly north of Postman's Park. At about noon, fifteen German aircraft began a bombing raid, devastating the area. Around 150 women and girls working in the nearby Debenhams factory panicked in the explosions, and ran <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> while the air raid was still in progress. PC Smith and the manager of the factory shepherded them back to safety in the building, but Smith was caught by the blast of one of the bombs and died.|$|E
500|$|In the pandemonium that followed, Bellingham {{sat quietly}} {{on a bench}} as Perceval was carried into the Speaker's quarters.

As it was, an official who had seen the shooting identified Bellingham, who was seized, disarmed, manhandled and searched. He remained calm, submitting to his captors without a struggle. When asked to explain his actions, he replied that he was rectifying a denial of justice {{on the part of the}} government.|$|E

500|$|The Medieval Merchant's House is a {{restored}} late-13th-century building in Southampton, Hampshire, England. Built in about 1290 by John Fortin, a prosperous merchant, the house survived many centuries {{of domestic and}} commercial use largely intact. German bomb damage in 1940 revealed the medieval interior of the house, and in the 1980s it was restored to resemble its initial appearance {{and placed in the}} care of English Heritage, to be run as a tourist attraction. The house is built to a medieval right-angle, narrow plan design, with an undercroft to store wine at a constant temperature, and a first-storey bedchamber that projects <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> to add additional space. The building is architecturally significant because, as historian Glyn Coppack highlights, it is [...] "the only building of its type to survive substantially as first built"; it is a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins at}} a press conference where Spears, wearing a cropped Mickey Mouse top (paying homage to her days in The New Mickey Mouse Club), is being asked {{inappropriate}} questions by news reporters, such as [...] "Is it true you banned junk food, smiles, candy, sunshine and laughter from your Femme Fatale tour?" [...] Angered by the questions, Spears replies (albeit censored): [...] "Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool, fuck you – I'm out", referencing a scene from the film Half Baked. After leaving the press conference, Spears walks out of the building and <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> wearing a white leather jacket and a black skirt with matching with studded combat boots. She signs a fan's copy of Femme Fatale and then blows a kiss to a baby as he whistles the melody of the chorus. As Spears walks along the street, she flashes several men, including a policeman (played by Adrien Galo). As a criminal offence, the policeman searches Spears, feeling up and down her legs, as she is bent over a car. Spears later walks away from the policeman, swinging handcuffs around her finger while he buttons his shirt.|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on November 25, 1910. The film had a wide national release, known advertising theaters include those in Nebraska, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Indiana, Montana, and Oklahoma, The New York Dramatic Mirror was neutral to slightly praising the production. The reviewer stated, [...] "It is a discursive narrative, not bound by laws of cause and effect, although it does not contradict them. It is amusing to see the rapidity with which a motion picture hero goes West. He throws a toothbrush and his pajamas into a suitcase, takes his hat over his arm, and breaks the news to his father before stepping {{from the living room}} <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> The special point of this film is the aviation exhibition, which is well handled. The hero is a very jocose gentleman, who smiles broadly with and without provocation. Other parts are adequately filled." [...] The Moving Picture World spared three roughly three sentences surrounding the focus of the plot, [...] "A love story built up around the invention of a new type of aeroplane. The machine flies and the inventor gets the girl of his choice. The picture has, therefore, a pleasant ending." ...|$|E
