5|$|In 2011, The Royal Park {{embarked}} on {{the restoration of}} the Serpentine to combat growing concerns about the status of the water {{and the quality of the}} aquatic environment. The project resulted in a substantial change to the hydrology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> which had a turnover time of 10 years, and is now reduced to 4–5 months as a result of new borehole water being pumped into the lake. The three boreholes, drilled into the Upper Chalk, now supply the lake with up to 900,000 cubic metres of water per annum ensuring that the lake remains fresh and does not stagnate. In addition, the historically contaminated sediments have been treated and nutrients within the sediments chemically neutralised. Thirdly, the oxygen status of the water and the overall mixing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> is now controlled by a series of 24 aeration pumps fixed to the base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> These ensure that the dissolved oxygen levels in the lake do not fall and result in chronic ecological stress. Finally, the overall ecology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> was reviewed and some of the large bream and carp were removed in February 2012 to reduce their disturbance of the sediment and vegetation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> These measures were implemented over the period October 2011 to June 2012. The resultant water quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> was excellent and proved to be an extremely popular venue for the swimming portion of the London 2012 Triathlon and the Marathon Swim events in August 2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to studies and accounts {{that showed the}} bad condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> the state restored the fish population <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> in 1978. In 1985, a study recommended ecological restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> and forest, which had been overtaken by invasive species introduced during highway construction. Since then, there have been seven plans for restoring natural elements of the park, as well as three plans for park restoration. Gradual improvements began {{taking place in the}} late 1980s, including the addition of new pathways, signage, and security, as well as the restoration of playgrounds and other recreational facilities. In January 1988, NYC Parks conducted a study to determine the specific elements of the park that needed restoration. Highway structures were also reconfigured to clean runoff from these structures. An excavation in the 1990s yielded over 2,500 artifacts.|$|E

5|$|The {{northern}} arm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> has a {{much higher}} salinity, {{to the point that}} the native brine shrimp cannot survive in its waters. In the southern portion, where the vast majority of the fresh water inlets are found, the salt level can dip below what is necessary for the brine shrimp to survive, while water in the northern bay is too salty. The salinity of northern arm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> will likely drop as lower salinity from the southern arm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> flows into the northern arm. The brine shrimp harvesting industry could benefit from the causeway allowing a freer flow of water. There were concerns from the brine shrimp harvesting industry that the lake conditions in the southern arm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> were becoming too saline for the brine shrimp due to several years of lower precipitation in the lake's watershed. The precipitation in the watershed has been above normal for the current water year that begins its tracking October 1, 2016. This additional precipitation has allowed the levels of both arms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> to rise, and at least for the near future the conditions for a healthy brine shrimp population seem good.|$|E
5|$|The {{proliferation}} of phumdis, coupled with severe infestation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> by water hyacinth, has substantially impeded water circulation and caused {{an increase in}} siltation and deposit of pollutants in the lake ecosystem. The building materials used to build huts on the phumdi blocks sunlight from reaching the lower depths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> water, which has resulted in formation of vertical profiles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> water body and decomposition. Further, pesticides and insecticides are used for catching fish or as insect repellent. Degradation {{is in the form}} of benthal, which, as it decays, releases toxic gases such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and reduces dissolved oxygen (DO). This causes the lake water to degenerate into a eutrophic condition, creating a dead water zone called the hypolimnion. Above the hypolimnion is a thin layer, known as epilimnion, where fish survive to some degree. The benthal is becoming increasingly thick, causing not only pollution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> water, but an increase in the shallow part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b>|$|E
