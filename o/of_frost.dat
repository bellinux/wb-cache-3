5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Aberdaron can have quite extreme weather, the number of frosts per year is very low, at around 7.2 days per year. This is {{comparable}} with coastal areas of Devon and Cornwall. The region, England NW and Wales N, averages 52.3 days, with December alone exceeding the average yearly amount <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> for Aberdaron. The village is generally quite windy throughout the year, particularly in Autumn and Winter. Sunshine amounts are lower than the UK average. Rainfall is well below the Wales average.|$|E

5|$|Cordyline australis is a light-demanding pioneer species, and {{seedlings}} die when overtopped {{by other}} trees. To grow well, young plants require open space {{so they are}} not shaded out by other vegetation. Another requirement is water during the seedling stage. Although adult trees can store water and are drought resistant, seedlings need a good supply of water to survive. This stops the species from growing in sand dunes unless there are wet depressions present, and from hillsides {{unless there is a}} seepage area. The fertility of the soil is another factor—settlers in Canterbury used the presence of the species to situate their homesteads and gardens. The fallen leaves of the tree also help to raise the fertility of the soil when they break down. Another factor is temperature, especially the degree <b>of</b> <b>frost.</b> Young trees are killed by frost, and even old trees can be cut back. This is why C.australis is absent from upland areas and from very frosty inland areas.|$|E
5|$|Crawley {{lies within}} the Sussex Weald, {{an area of}} highly {{variable}} terrain, so that many microclimates <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> hollows, sun traps and windswept hilltops will be encountered over a short distance. During calm, clear periods of weather this allows for some interesting temperature variations, {{although most of the}} time, when mobile westerly airstreams persist, the weather is typically Oceanic {{like the rest of the}} British Isles. Gatwick is the nearest weather station that publishes long-term averages that give an accurate description of the climate of the Crawley area, although more recently the Met Office has also published data for its nearby weather station at Charlwood. Both weather stations are about 3 miles north of Crawley town centre and at similar altitudes.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, {{observations}} from Earth {{were made of}} Triton's limb as it passed in front of stars. These observations indicated {{the presence of a}} denser atmosphere than was deduced from Voyager 2 data. Other observations have shown an increase in temperature by 5% from 1989 to 1998. These observations indicate Triton is approaching an unusually warm summer season that happens only once every few hundred years. Theories for this warming include a change <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> patterns on Triton's surface and a change in ice albedo, which would allow more heat to be absorbed. Another theory argues the changes in temperature are a result of deposition of dark, red material from geological processes. Because Triton's Bond albedo is among the highest within the Solar System, it is sensitive to small variations in spectral albedo.|$|E
5|$|In January 1971, with Bobby Moore, Brian Dear and Clyde Best, Greaves was {{involved}} in late-night drinking, against the wishes of manager Ron Greenwood, prior to an FA Cup tie away to Blackpool. On arriving in Blackpool, Greaves and his teammates had been informed {{by members of the}} press that the game, the following day, was unlikely to go ahead due to a frozen pitch and the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> that night. Believing {{that there would be no}} game the following day, Greaves drank 12 lagers in a club owned by Brian London and did not return to the team hotel until 1.45am. In fact, the match went ahead and West Ham lost 4–0. Greaves claimed the defeat was not a result of the late night, the drinking or the frozen pitch, but because the West Ham team in which he was playing was not good enough. As a result, the players were fined and dropped by the club.|$|E
5|$|In {{neighboring}} {{areas of}} Russia {{there are significant}} numbers of Norway spruce, but they only exist sporadically within Øvre Pasvik, {{with no more than}} 40 trees in one place. The lack of spruce is caused by a combination <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> occurring as late as June, and wildfire. There is also a limited amount of birch, specifically dwarf birch and silver birch. Aspen is uncommon largely because its bark and roots are popular food for animals. Along some creeks there are bird cherry and grey alder. The area is too dry to allow the latter to grow away from creeks and lake sides. There are eight to ten species of willow within the national park.|$|E

25|$|Spring {{and fall}} are {{characterized}} by mild temperatures {{during the day and}} cool to cold nights. Normally, the last frost occurs on 1 October while the first frost occurs on 9 May although frosts have been recorded as early as 16 March and as late as 8 November. Although the majority <b>of</b> <b>frosts</b> occurs in June–August, the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>frosts</b> in Spring and Fall can potentially damage crops.|$|R
5|$|The mild seas that {{surround}} Portland act to keep night-time temperatures above freezing, making winter frost rare: on average 9.6 days per year— {{this is far}} below the United Kingdom's average annual total of 55.6 days <b>of</b> <b>frost.</b> Days with snow lying are equally rare: on average zero to six days per year; almost all winters have {{no more than one}} day with snow lying. It may snow or sleet in winter, yet it almost never settles on the ground—coastal areas in South West England such as Portland generally experience the mildest winters in the UK. Portland is less affected by the Atlantic storms that Devon and Cornwall experience. The growing season lasts for more than 310 days per year, and the borough is in Hardiness zone 9.|$|E
5|$|The {{ranges of}} the American and Chinese {{alligator}} extend into regions that sometimes experience periods <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> in winter. Being ectothermic, the internal body temperature of crocodilians falls {{as the temperature}} drops, and they become sluggish. They may become more active on warm days, but do not usually feed at all during the winter. In cold weather, they remain submerged with their tails in deeper, less cold water and their nostrils just projecting through the surface. If ice forms on the water, they maintain ice-free breathing holes, {{and there have been}} occasions when their snouts have become frozen into the ice. Temperature sensing probes implanted in wild American alligators have found that their core body temperatures can descend to around , but as long as they remain able to breathe they show no ill effects when the weather warms up.|$|E

25|$|California {{is a very}} geologically diverse {{region and}} varies greatly {{in the range of}} climates and terroirs that can be found. Most of the state's wine regions are found between the Pacific coast and the Central Valley. The Pacific Ocean and large bays, like San Francisco Bay, serve as {{tempering}} influences to the wine regions nearby providing cool winds and fog that balance the heat and sunshine. While drought can be a vinicultural hazard, most areas of California receive sufficient amounts of rainfall with the annual rainfall of wine regions north of San Francisco between 24-45inches (615–1150mm) and the more southern regions receiving 13-20inches. Winters are mild with little threat <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> damage though springtime. To curb the threat <b>of</b> <b>frost,</b> vineyard owners will often employ the use of wind machines, sprinklers and smudge pots to protect the vines.|$|E
