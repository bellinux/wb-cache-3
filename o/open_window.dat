He screams for the nurse, but she has already been bitten and opens the window to let the monster in. Scully tries to visit Mulder but the nurse refuses access. Suddenly Scully sees the nurse as a corpse, realizes that Mulder is in danger, and runs into Mulder's room. There she sees the monster {{on the wall and}} shoots at it. It leaps through the partially <b>open</b> <b>window,</b> breaking the glass and wooden frame.|$|E
5|$|The song {{has been}} well-received, with many complimenting its {{inspirational}} lyrical content, and {{described it as}} an <b>open</b> <b>window</b> into Carey's personal life for listeners. Commercially it was Carey's lowest charting lead single {{to date on the}} US Billboard Hot 100, and her first lead single to that point to not reach the top ten in the United States. Though stalling at number 81, it became successful on the Billboard dance charts, hitting number 1 for a week in the United States. The song also achieve higher placements in international markets, reaching the top in Spain and peaking within the top ten in Canada, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.|$|E

Director Singh also drew inspiration from the Italian painter Caravaggio and the video is laden with religious imagery such as Saint Sebastian, the Biblical episode of the Incredulity of Thomas and Hindu deities, portrayed in a series of tableaux.|$|E

5|$|Ann {{discovers that}} her predecessor, Emily Jessel (Lightfoot), {{is buried in}} Bly's church, and is told that Jessel killed herself. She also begins to see the figures {{of a young man}} and a young woman around Bly. Mrs Grose dismisses Ann's stories, but one maid, Carla (Walker), tells Ann of the sexually abusive former valet Peter Quint (MacLiam). Mrs Grose reveals that Carla had been badly {{affected}} by the War, and is prone to flights of fancy. Later, Ann is woken at night by the figure of the woman, and follows her to find Flora standing next to an <b>open</b> <b>window.</b> The pair see Carla fall from the roof, landing near Miles, who is in the garden. Ann rushes outside, and sees the male figure on the roof. Inside again, Mrs Grose assures Ann that she must be confused.|$|E
5|$|On July 19, 1848, {{the morning}} of the first day of convention, the {{organizing}} committee arrived at the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel shortly before ten o'clock on a hot, sunny day to find a crowd gathered outside and the church doors locked—an overlooked detail. Stanton's young nephew Daniel was lifted through an <b>open</b> <b>window</b> so that he could unbar the doors from the inside. Even though the first session had been announced as being exclusively for women, some young children of both sexes had been brought by their mothers, and about 40 men were there expecting to attend. The men were not turned away, but were asked to remain silent. Mary Ann M'Clintock, Jr., 26 years old, was appointed secretary, to take notes.|$|E
5|$|The heat is made {{tangible}} by the flustered {{appearance of}} the woman as she fans herself (the fan itself displays a classical scene—perhaps Venus, Adonis and Cupid); the sluggish pregnant dog that looks longingly towards the water; and the vigorous vine growing {{on the side of}} the tavern. As is often the case in Hogarth's work, the dog's expression reflects that of its master. The family rush home, past the New River and a tavern with a sign showing Sir Hugh Myddleton, who bankrupted himself financing the construction of the river to bring running water into London in 1613 (a wooden pipe lies by the side of the watercourse). Through the <b>open</b> <b>window</b> other refugees from the city can be seen sheltering from the oppressive heat in the bar. While they appear more jolly than the dyer and his family, Hogarth pokes fun at these people escaping to the country for fresh air only to reproduce the smoky air and crowded conditions of the city by huddling in the busy tavern with their pipes.|$|E

A shelter shed with an enclosed office in its south-east corner is located between the siding and the main line. The shed has an earth floor and a hipped roof, and the timber walls and posts are mounted on concrete wall and post bases. The timber framed walls of the office section are single skinned, and are clad with chamferboards. The office has <b>open</b> <b>window</b> frames on the south and west sides, a pivoting timber window to the east side and a timber door on the north side.

The reaction of spectators inside the theater to the news that the theater was under terrorist attack was not uniform: some people remained calm, some reacted hysterically, and others fainted.

40|$|Active {{noise control}} (ANC) is a {{potential}} technique to mitigate environmental noise through <b>open</b> <b>windows</b> of dwellings, leaving a small visual footprint (as opposed to passive barriers). Existing studies on ANC of <b>open</b> <b>windows</b> have shown that noise attenuate (up to 10 dB) is attainable under certain scenarios. The physical limits of this technique, however, are not clearly defined. Does ANC of <b>open</b> <b>windows</b> result in effective noise control in the whole room? How many anti-noise sources are needed to achieve satisfactory attenuation? How does the separation distance between anti-noise sources affect attenuation? To answer these questions, the physical limits of ANC of <b>open</b> <b>windows</b> have been investigated using finite element modelling in two dimensions. Various numbers of secondary sources are positioned in {{the plane of the}} window and optimised to minimise the sound power transmitted through the window due to an incident plane wave. Our simulations show that global control of noise is possible with ANC of <b>open</b> <b>windows</b> at low frequencies, regardless of noise incidence angles. By plotting the relationship between maximum attenuation {{as a function of the}} wavenumber, k, and window width, w, (i. e. attenuation against kw) for different angles of incidence, the optimised number of secondary sources (for different window sizes) can be decided based on the required level of attenuatio...|$|R
