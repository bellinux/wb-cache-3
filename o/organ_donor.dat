While she was an NCMP, Parliament debated the Human Organ Transplant (Amendment) Bill 2009 which would permit an <b>organ</b> <b>donor</b> to receive a reasonable amount of payment as a reimbursement for medical checks, insurance and other medical expenses, and loss of income. Lim spoke of her worry that the bill might lead to a backdoor organ trading and profiteering.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, after being in a car accident, Reyes awakens in a surreal hospital. Doggett and a comatose Reyes struggle to prevent her <b>organ</b> <b>donor</b> card from being acted upon. The two, however, soon discover a unique woman, Audrey Pauley, who {{has the ability to}} communicate with both those conscious and unconscious.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) tells John Doggett (Robert Patrick) that Reyes is braindead, a {{fact that}} Doggett refuses to believe. Preijers informs Doggett and Scully that, since Reyes was an <b>organ</b> <b>donor,</b> {{in a few days}} her life-support will be pulled and the {{hospital}} will harvest her remains. In the floating hospital, Reyes sees a woman (Tracey Ellis), standing in the hallway, whom Monica follows, but then the woman disappears. At that moment, Barreiro begins screaming and is engulfed in blue electricity before disappearing. In the real world, it is revealed that Barreiro, a fellow comatose patient, has had his life support removed by Preijers. Nearby stands the mystery woman that Reyes encountered: Audrey Pauley.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting Holby City origins as a {{spin-off}} from Casualty and the {{closely related}} premises {{of the two}} programmes, the BBC has screened occasional crossover mini-dramas entitled Casualty@Holby City, featuring a number of characters {{from each of the}} two casts. Prior to the commissioning of Casualty@Holby City, the two shows had occasionally crossed-over storylines and cast members before; for instance developing a romance between Holby City Ben Saunders (David Paisley) and Casualty Tony Vincent (Lee Warburton). The first full crossover was spearheaded by Casualty executive producer Mervyn Watson, and Holby City McHale. Logistical difficulties arose from the fact the two series are usually produced 120 miles apart, and work on both shows had to be halted for two weeks to release a number of cast members to appear in the special. A second crossover was commissioned in 2005 as part of the BBC's DoNation season, aiming to raise public awareness of organ donation and help viewers make an informed decision about whether to sign up to the <b>Organ</b> <b>Donor</b> Register. An interactive episode of Casualty@Holby City was one of the headlining shows of the season, allowing viewers to vote by phone to determine the outcome of a fictional organ donation. The third Casualty@Holby City crossover aired in October 2005. The four-part storyline tackled the issue of youth violence, following the events of a turbulent A demonstration at an inner-city school. Based on the success of the 2004 Casualty@Holby City Christmas special, another crossover was ordered for Christmas 2005. Rather than dividing the episodes between the two series' crews as had previously been standard, this crossover operated as an entirely separate production, with Kyle producing and Paul Harrison directing.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if bacterial translocation and endotoxin absorption occur in <b>organ</b> <b>donors</b> with an anatomically intact gastrointestinal tract. Design: Case series. Setting: Intensive care units {{in general and}} university hospitals. Patients: Twenty-one (multiple) <b>organ</b> <b>donors.</b> Intervention: None. Main Outcome Measures: Occurrence of factors that may promote bacterial translocation and/or endotoxin absorption. Bacterial concentration in mesenteric lymph nodes, abdominal fluid, blood, liver, lung, and spleen. Endotoxin level in abdominal fluid, peripheral blood, and portal blood. Anatomical integrity of the bowel wall. Results: Factors that may promote bacterial translocation and/or endotoxin absorption were present in all <b>organ</b> <b>donors.</b> Culture specimens revealed bacteria in 14 <b>Organ</b> <b>donors</b> (67 %). In 210 (81 %) of 260 culture specimens, the bacteria isolated were identical to those isolated from the bowel content, demonstrating bacterial translocation. Endotoxin was found in nine (53 %) of 17 abdominal fluid samples, in four (19 %) of 21 peripheral blood samples, and in two (10 %) of 21 portal blood samples. Light- and electron-microscopic examination of the bowel wall showed no anatomical abnormalities. Conclusion: Bacterial translocation and endotoxin absorption are frequent among <b>organ</b> <b>donors</b> and may adversely influence organ function in transplant recipients and other critically ill patients...|$|R

25|$|Within the European Union, organ {{donation}} is regulated by member states. As of 2010, 24 European countries {{have some form}} of presumed consent (opt-out) system, with the most prominent and limited opt-out systems in Spain, Austria, and Belgium yielding high donor rates. In the United Kingdom {{organ donation}} is voluntary and no consent is presumed. Individuals who wish to donate their organs after death can use the Organ Donation Register, a national database. The government of Wales became the first constituent country in the UK to adopt presumed consent in July 2013. The opt-out organ donation scheme in Wales went live on December 1, 2015 and is expected {{to increase the amount of}} donors by 25%. In 2008, the UK discussed whether to switch to an opt-out system in light of the success in other countries and a severe British <b>organ</b> <b>donor</b> shortfall. In Italy if the deceased neither allowed nor refused donation while alive, relatives will pick the decision on his or her behalf despite a 1999 act that provided for a proper opt-out system.

40|$|Background. We studied {{previously}} {{patterns of}} organ donation in a teaching hospital. Eleven years later we repeated {{the study to}} investigate how patterns had changed. We also wanted to see whether non-heart beating donation was being practised in our intensive care units. Methods. All deaths were prospectively audited to identify potential heart beating and non-heart beating <b>organ</b> <b>donors.</b> The actual <b>organ</b> <b>donors</b> and reasons for not donating were identi®ed. Results. Overall, there was a signi®cant {{reduction in the number}} of potential <b>organ</b> <b>donors</b> in the 11 -yr period. This was accompanied by an increase in refusal rates by relatives from 10 to 29 %, and a decrease in refusal rates by the coroner from 28 to 11 %. Conclusions. In this hospital the number of potential and actual <b>organ</b> <b>donors</b> has fallen in 11 yr. This is a combination of decreasing numbers of patients becoming brain dead and increased relative refusal rate. It has only been partially offset by a more liberal attitude of the coroner and non-heart beating donors...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of the complement system in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury and acute rejection is widely recognized, however its contribution to the pathogenesis of tissue damage in the donor remains underexposed. Brain-dead (BD) <b>organ</b> <b>donors</b> are still {{the primary source of}} organs for transplantation. Brain death is characterized by hemodynamic changes, hormonal dysregulation, and immunological activation. Recently, the complement system {{has been shown to be}} involved. In BD <b>organ</b> <b>donors,</b> complement is activated systemically and locally and is an important mediator of inflammation and graft injury. Furthermore, complement activation can be used as a clinical marker for the prediction of graft function after transplantation. Experimental models of BD have shown that inhibition of the complement cascade is a successful method to reduce inflammation and injury of donor grafts, thereby improving graft function and survival after transplantation. Consequently, complement-targeted therapeutics in BD <b>organ</b> <b>donors</b> form a new opportunity to improve organ quality for transplantation. Future studies should further elucidate the mechanism responsible for complement activation in BD <b>organ</b> <b>donors.</b> (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
