25|$|The 1991 Halloween {{blizzard}} was {{a powerful}} storm that caused a period of heavy snowfall and ice accumulation, which affected parts of the Upper Midwest of the United States, from October 31 to November 3, 1991. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of October 1991 a large storm system over the Atlantic Ocean (1991 Perfect Storm) blocked most of the weather patterns over {{the eastern half of}} the United States, and in turn moisture from the Gulf of Mexico was funneled straight northward over the affected region. By the time the precipitation stopped falling many cities in the eastern half of Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin had witnessed record early-season snowfall accumulations, while parts of southern Minnesota and northern Iowa were crippled by a large ice storm. Arctic air that was pulled southward behind the storm had combined with the heavy snow pack to produce many record low temperatures. Between the blizzard and the ice storm 22people were killed and over 100 were injured.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2001, {{as soon as}} {{it became}} known that the Ames strain of anthrax had been used in the attacks, {{longtime}} anti-nuclear, anti-biological warfare defense activist Barbara Hatch Rosenberg and others began suggesting that the attack might be the work of a [...] "rogue CIA agent", and they provided the name of the [...] "most likely" [...] person to the FBI. On November 21, 2001, she made similar statements to the Biological and Toxic Weapons convention in Geneva. In December 2001, she published [...] "A Compilation of Evidence and Comments on the Source of the Mailed Anthrax" [...] via the web site of The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) suggesting the attacks were [...] "perpetrated with the unwitting assistance of a sophisticated government program". She discussed the case with reporters from The New York Times. On January 4, 2002, Nicholas Kristof of The New York Times published a column titled [...] "Profile of a Killer" [...] stating [...] "I think I know who sent out the anthrax last fall."

On June 13, 2002, Rosenberg posted [...] "The Anthrax Case: What the FBI Knows" [...] to the FAS site. [...] On June 18, 2002, Rosenberg presented her theories to senate staffers working for Senators Daschle and Leahy. One week later, on June 25, the FBI publicly searched Hatfill's apartment. He becomes a household name. [...] "The FBI also pointed out that Hatfill had agreed to the search and is not considered a suspect." [...] American Prospect and Salon.com report, [...] "Hatfill is not a suspect in the anthrax case, the FBI says." [...] On August 3, 2002, Rosenberg tells the media that the FBI asked her if [...] "a team of government scientists could be trying to frame Steven J. Hatfill". In August 2002, Attorney General John Ashcroft labeled Steven Hatfill a [...] "person of interest" [...] in a press conference, no charges were brought against him. Hatfill, a virologist, vehemently denied he {{had anything to do with}} the anthrax (bacteria) mailings and sued the FBI, the Justice Department, John Ashcroft, Alberto Gonzales, and others for violating his constitutional rights and for violating the Privacy Act.
