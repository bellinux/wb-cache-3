Especially common are selenides (R2Se, analogues of thioethers), diselenides (R2Se2, analogues of disulfides), and selenols (RSeH, analogues of thiols). Representatives of selenides, diselenides, and selenols include respectively selenomethionine, diphenyldiselenide, and benzeneselenol. The sulfoxide in sulfur chemistry is represented in selenium chemistry by the selenoxides (formula RSe(O)R), which are intermediates in organic synthesis, {{as illustrated by the}} selenoxide elimination reaction. Consistent with trends indicated by the double bond rule, selenoketones, R(C=Se)R, and selenaldehydes, R(C=Se)H, are rarely observed.|$|E

30|$|A {{number of}} {{interesting}} works {{have described the}} application of HRMAS NMR to edible vegetables. For example, seeds, peel, flesh, and puree of tomatoes were studied by HRMAS to produce a metabolomic profiling of Spanish Almeria tomatoes and identify the molecular markers correlated to ripening process [59]. Later, the same research group used HRMAS to differentiate three varieties of tomatoes and {{the basis of their}} composition [60]. In particular, they observed that the content in metabolites relevant for the tomato taste, such as fructose and organic acids, depended on the specific variety [60]. Ritota et al. [61] reported the use of HRMAS to differentiate Italian sweet peppers (Capsicum annum L.) as a function of both cultivar and geographical origin [61]. Later, the same research group used a similar 1 H- and 13 C-HRMAS approach to characterize two Italian cultivars of garlic (Allium sativum L.) [62]. They found several <b>organosulfurs,</b> allicin, and some allyl-organosulfurs in garlic samples and confirmed their presence by SPE-GC-MS analysis. Lam et al.

40|$|Garlic {{has been}} used {{worldwide}} for centuries for its taste, but also for its health benefits. The therapeutic compounds are mostly <b>organosulfurs,</b> and can be formed when an enzyme, alliinase, gets in contact with its substrate, alliin. Both are separated in an entire cell, and react when the plant is damaged. The product of the enzymatic reaction, allicin, turns quickly into different molecules with potential beneficial effects. The way garlic is processed has {{a major influence on}} the released products. Indeed, an aqueous or oily medium, as far as the temperature, can emphasize the formation of specific compounds. Vinyldithiins are one of the active molecules, and are part of the garlic’s organoleptic properties. Their effects against obesity have been recently proven. This study aims to describe the conditions of vinyldithiins formation, as well as its extraction, purification and analyse. Vinyldithiins are mostly produced when garlic is crushed in edible oil, at low temperature. Extraction conditions (garlic/oil ratio, oil and garlic source, temperature and extraction time) were optimized. Analysis of the results were performed by HPLC. Finally, a purification process was set up. These results allow better knowledges on vinyldithiins formation that can be applied in garlic-based nutraceuticals. They might also lead to new uses of garlic in the production of highly valuable compounds. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Background: Previous results {{demonstrated}} dietary 2 -mercaptoethanol (2 -ME) delayed {{appearance of}} cancer in certain murine strains. In addition, it had a benefit not found with other <b>organosulfurs,</b> in that it completely prevented spontaneous development {{of cancer in}} BXSB-Yaa + over an entire lifespan. Aims: These benefits raise the question: What, if any, alteration of radiation-induced tumorigenesis would 2 -ME impart that may differ from that of other sulfur antioxidants? This is relevant based on the extensive use of radiation in diagnoses and therapy and 2 -ME′s superior in vitro and in situ immune enhancement properties. Materials and Methods: This was addressed by exposing long-lived, B 10. A (4 R) mice to sublethal, 5. 5 Gy ionizing gamma-rays and then tumor development monitored over a lifetime. Statistical Analysis: Two-tailed P-values were determined using the Fischer′s Exact Test. Results: The only tumors detected were mammary and only in animals that were both exposed to radiation and not treated with 2 -ME. The 43 % incidence differed significantly from the absence of tumors in non-irradiated mice that were or were not exposed to 2 -ME and in those irradiated and treated daily with 2 -ME, irrespective of whether treatment was started prior to or post irradiation. However, quite unexpectedly, radiation shortened longevity 29 % from undefined causes, including cancer, in animals pretreated with 2 -ME; longevity was not altered in those not pretreated or if treatment was started post-irradiation. Conclusions: The findings have relevance for cancer prevention and the controversy relative to ′′long term survival/safety′′ of currently used antioxidants as free radical scavengers in humans undergoing radiotherapy...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} {{advantage of}} using a short-term pre-aeration of municipal solid waste (MSW) with high organic fractions prior to landfilling is that it intensively decomposes a part of organic matter, especially easily biodegradable fractions in waste, and thus regulates the subsequent anaerobic degradation of MSW under landfill conditions, meanwhile conserving the bio-methane potential as much as possible. However, this organic matter degraded during the pre-aeration process is converted by aerobic microorganisms into high concentrations of organic leachate and exhausted gases (e. g. NH 3 and volatile organic compounds), which are also potential pollution sources to the surrounding environment. In this study, the emission characteristics of leachate and odorous gases generated during a short-term pre-aeration process of MSW are investigated in a laboratory reactor. It is found that MSW, pre-treated aerobically for 7 days, results in ~ 28. 1 % of weight loss and ~ 30. 3 % of capacity loss, respectively. Due to the initial hydrolysis, acidification and leaching of organic solids, TOC concentrations in leachate generated during the pre-aeration process increase rapidly at the beginning, and then are maintained at relatively stable levels, averaging from 16, 700 to 26, 000 mg/L. A certain amount of VFAs, mainly butyric acid (50 - 75 %) and acetic acid (20 - 50 %), is detected in leachate, with the concentration range of 1, 000 - 18, 000 mg/L, which can increase the odorous risk from leachate storage and treatment operation. NH 3 emission in the exhaust gases is highly consistent with the degradation of proteins and temperature evolution, with the maximum release capacity of ~ 37. 6 mg/(kg DM. h) occurring at day 4. Compared to the initial untreated waste, the release strength of halocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons from the pre-aerated waste is obviously decreased, whereas higher concentrations of <b>organosulfurs,</b> such as ethanethiol and dimethyl disulfide, and alkanes are observed (~ 10 times higher). This finding suggests that more attention should be paid to control the odorous charge during the subsequent storage, transportation and landfilling operation of the pre-aerated waste...|$|R
