2500|$|In his book, Meditations on First Philosophy, René Descartes postulates three classifications for {{our ideas}} when he says, [...] "Among my ideas, some {{appear to be}} innate, some to be adventitious, and others to have been invented by me. My {{understanding}} of what a thing is, what truth is, and what thought is, seems to derive simply from my own nature. But my hearing a noise, as I do now, or seeing the sun, or feeling the fire, comes from things which are located outside me, <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> have hitherto judged. Lastly, sirens, hippogriffs and the like are my own invention." ...|$|E

According to producer Spikings, Cimino {{said he wanted to}} work again with Washburn. According to producer Deeley, he only heard from office rumor that Washburn was contracted by Cimino to work on the script. [...] "Whether Cimino hired Washburn as his sub-contractor or as a co-writer was constantly being obfuscated," [...] wrote Deeley, [...] "and there were some harsh words between them later on, <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> was told." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 3 January 2017 Cartwright was {{presented}} his baggy green cap by former Australian cricketer Tom Moody {{to make his}} debut in third Test match against Pakistan, replacing Nic Maddinson. Cartwright averaged over 44.50 with the bat and had taken 15 wickets from 16 games at 44. Captain Steve Smith said Cartwright's bowling had [...] "improved a lot {{over the last year}} <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> remember facing him a little while ago and I think since then he's probably gained 10ks and got a lot more consistent with his areas. I think he's improved a lot. I guess it depends how much we'll use him, how the game goes. But he's certainly improved over the last year." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We went to Pendlebury in 1909 from a {{residential}} side of Manchester, and we didn't like it. My father {{wanted to go}} to get near a friend for business reasons.

Then I began to wonder if anyone had ever done it. Seriously, not one or two, but seriously; and it seemed to me by that time that it was a very fine industrial subject matter. And I couldn't see anybody at that time who had done it – and nobody had done it, it seemed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cheung {{distinguished}} {{himself as}} a Canto-pop singer through embodying the politics, sexual and gender identity of a queer subject position. He announced his gay relationship with Daffy Tong during a concert in 1997, earning him prestige in LGBT communities in China, Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. In a 2001 interview with Time magazine, Cheung said: [...] "It's more appropriate to say I'm bisexual. I've had girlfriends. When I was 22 <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> asked my girlfriend Teresa Mo (...) to marry me.", but was unsuccessful. In two interviews in 1992 and 2002, Cheung also stated that [...] "My mind is bisexual. It's {{easy for me to}} love a woman. It's also easy for me to love a man too" [...] and [...] "I believe that a good actor would be androgynous, and ever changing," [...] referencing his performance of intersexuality, androgynous dressing, and gay femininity in his music videos and films.|$|E

2500|$|Ellison recalls [...] "I {{had played}} in the winning tour to India of 1984–85 and bowled well, <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> thought. But I was injured for {{the early part of}} the 1985 season, which was {{incredibly}} frustrating. I knew that if fit, I could make a compelling case for my inclusion in the Ashes team." [...] His determination to get back into the Test squad was not deterred by not being selected for the first three Tests, but he then had an opportunity to impress the then England captain, David Gower. Ellison's recollection is that [...] "Kent, my county, were playing a game against Leicestershire in July and I approached [...] David Gower and said: 'I'm going to make you pick [...] me.' I soon started to take wickets and was called into the squad for the fourth Test in Manchester." [...] Ellison took 3–58 in the first-class match, including Gower's wicket in the only innings in which he bowled.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of World War I at the young age of 16, Brodovitch {{abandoned}} his dream of entering the Imperial Art Academy and {{ran away from home}} to join the Russian army. Not long after, his father had him brought home and hired a private tutor to help Alexey finish school. Upon graduating, Brodovitch ran away again on several occasions. He recalls: After a week <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> ran away to the front line to kill Germans. But my father, now a military general {{at the head of a}} Red Cross hospital train, had plenty of influence, and I was soon brought back to him. On the train back I was employed as a nurses' aid. In East Prussia I ran away again and joined a nearby regiment. Once again I was caught, and this time I was sent to an officers' school, the Corps de Pages. During the Russian Civil War, Brodovitch served with the White Army. While fighting against the Bolsheviks in Odessa, he was badly wounded and was hospitalized for a time in Kislovodsk, in the Caucasus. [...] In 1918, the town was surrounded by the Bolsheviks, forcing Brodovitch into exile. It was during this retreat to the south through Caucasus and Turkey that he met his future wife, Nina.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973 she was {{a student}} at the University of the Witwatersrand when she met her first husband, the finance magnate and art collector, Gordon Schachat. They married in Mauritius in 1982 and shared a home {{together}} in Linksfield Ridge, an upscale Jewish area in Johannesburg's northern suburbs. Their two-year marriage ended in divorce in 1984. Allan attributed her burgeoning career as a factor: [...] "I was obsessed with my column. I was intent on becoming the best journalist in the country." [...] They remained friends and Schachat supported Allan's testimony in the 1992 libel suit she brought against Channel 4 in London. Allan told a London court that eight years after their marriage breakup, Schachat was her closest friend and described their union as [...] "the right people at the wrong time." [...] Allan writes about the marriage to Schachat in her 2015 memoir, Jani Confidential: [...] "I keep thinking about what happened and what I would have done differently. Pretty much everything I suppose. Gordon had to live through the weekly angst about the column. It was like reinventing the wheel every week. My validity as a partner hinged - <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> thought - on my success as a columnist. I couldn't have got it more wrong. The column was the all-consuming Moloch, when it had been put to bed, there was nothing left of me." ...|$|E
