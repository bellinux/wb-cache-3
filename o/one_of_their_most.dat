5|$|Before {{moving to}} the collegiate level, Watanabe {{attended}} Jinsei Gakuen High School in Zentsūji, Kagawa. He later transferred to St. Thomas More Preparatory School in Oakdale, Connecticut in 2013. Watanabe rose to fame with this high school program, and was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>most</b> valuable players in the National Prep School Invitational as a senior in 2014. He also gained attention from several different newspapers, including The New York Times.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} their rivalry, the two sides {{previously}} contemplated ground-sharing {{as part of the}} SFA's unsuccessful bid to host Euro 2008. Perhaps <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>most</b> notable meetings was in the 1980 Scottish League Cup Final played at Dens Park when United won 3–0 to claim their second League Cup in successive seasons.|$|E
5|$|A {{video game}} {{distribution}} service, GOG.com {{was established by}} CD Projekt to help players find old games. Its mission is to offer games free of digital rights management (DRM) to players and its service was expanded to cover new AAA and independent games. The company opposes DRM in video games, and hopes that free downloadable content becomes an industry standard. CD Projekt considers maintaining their independence <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>most</b> important strategies. As of September 2017, {{it is the largest}} publicly-traded game company in Poland, and also became the fifth largest game company in the Americas and Europe in terms of revenue and market capitalization after Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Take-Two Interactive, and Ubisoft.|$|E

5|$|After Malky MacDonald {{took charge}} of two games on a {{caretaker}} basis, Bobby Brown was appointed manager. Brown was the first Scotland manager to be given full control of the team, as until then the SFA selection committee had continued to choose the players. Scotland achieved <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>most</b> famous victories {{in his first game}} in charge, a 3–2 win against 1966 World Cup winners England at Wembley. The team generally performed well under Brown, but were drawn with West Germany in 1970 FIFA World Cup qualification. Scotland needed to avoid defeat in Hamburg to keep their qualification hopes alive, but lost 3–2.|$|E
5|$|He was {{replaced}} by former player Billy Bonds. In Bonds' first full season, 1990–91, West Ham again secured promotion to Division One. Now back in the top flight, Bonds saw West Ham through <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>most</b> controversial seasons. With the club planning to introduce a bond scheme, there was crowd unrest. West Ham finished last and were relegated back to Division Two after only one season. However, they rebounded strongly in 1992–93. With Trevor Morley and Clive Allen scoring 40 goals, they guaranteed themselves second place {{on the last day}} of the season with a 2–0 home win against Cambridge United, and with it promotion to the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|His loyalty {{the crown}} {{was such that}} in 1460 the Yorkists proclaimed him <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>most</b> mortal enemies among the king's supporters. They also claimed that Beaumont, along with the earls of Wiltshire and Shrewsbury, orchestrated the Yorkists' {{attainder}} at the 1459 Coventry parliament, in order to seize the Yorkists' lands. It is likely {{that they were the}} public focus of the Yorkists' enmity in a way that Henry VI's queen (to whom he was a personal adviser), Margaret of Anjou could not be.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, {{the band}} {{released}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>most</b> popular, controversial and acclaimed albums, The Number of the Beast. The artwork and title track led to Christian {{groups in the}} United States branding the band as Satanists, encouraging people to destroy copies of the release. The band's manager, Rod Smallwood, later commented that Christians initially burnt the records, but later decided to destroy them with hammers through fear of breathing in the melting vinyl's fumes. The protests were not restricted to the US, with Christian organisations preventing Iron Maiden from performing in Chile in 1992.|$|E
5|$|One day, the Philistine leaders {{assemble}} in {{a temple}} for a religious sacrifice to Dagon, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>most</b> important deities, for having delivered Samson into their hands. They summon Samson {{so that people}} can watch him perform for them. The temple is so crowded that people are even climbing onto the roof to watch—and all the rulers of the entire government of Philistia have gathered there too, some 3,000 people in all. Samson is led into the temple, and he asks his captors to let him lean against the supporting pillars to rest. He prays for strength and God gives him strength to break the pillars, causing the temple to collapse, killing him and the people inside.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{planning}} for Bodyguard and Ironside rested with John Bevan and the London Controlling Section (LCS). The LCS {{had been set}} up in 1942 following successes in deception in the Middle East by Dudley Clarke. After initial attempts at deception planning the department was tasked with bringing Bodyguard to fruition. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>most</b> useful deception channels was through double agents. During {{the early stages of the}} war, the Abwehr (German intelligence) had sent spies to Britain, but all of them either surrendered or were captured. Some, along with other volunteers, were used as an extensive misinformation network under the control of the Twenty Committee.|$|E

5|$|The 747 was {{conceived}} while air travel was increasing in the 1960s. The era of commercial jet transportation, {{led by the}} enormous popularity of the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, had revolutionized long-distance travel. Even before it lost the CX-HLS contract, Boeing was asked by Juan Trippe, president of Pan American World Airways (Pan Am), <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>most</b> important airline customers, to build a passenger aircraft {{more than twice the}} size of the 707. During this time, airport congestion, worsened by increasing numbers of passengers carried on relatively small aircraft, became a problem that Trippe thought could be addressed by a larger new aircraft.|$|E
5|$|When the Second World War began, Bethe {{wanted to}} {{contribute}} to the war effort, but was unable to work on classified projects until he became a citizen. Following the advice of the Caltech aerodynamicist Theodore von Kármán, Bethe collaborated with his friend Teller on a theory of shock waves which are generated by the passage of a projectile through a gas. Bethe considered it <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>most</b> influential papers. He also worked on a theory of armor penetration, which was immediately classified by the Army, making it inaccessible to Bethe, who was not an American citizen at the time.|$|E
5|$|At Auschwitz, {{the actual}} {{delivery}} of gas {{to the victims}} was always handled by the SS, {{on the order of}} the supervising SS doctor. Many of the SS doctors also conducted inhumane medical experiments on camp prisoners. The most infamous SS doctor, Josef Mengele, served as a medical officer at Auschwitz under the command of Eduard Wirths of the camp's medical corps. Mengele undertook selections even when he was not assigned {{to do so in the}} hope of finding subjects for his experiments. He was particularly interested in locating sets of twins. In contrast to most of the doctors, who viewed undertaking selections as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>most</b> stressful and horrible duties, Mengele undertook the task with a flamboyant air, often smiling or whistling a tune. After the war, many SS doctors were charged with war crimes for their inhumane medical experiments and for their role in gas chamber selections.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of Joan of Arc, Etty's health continued to deteriorate. He continued to paint and exhibit, but his retirement plans grew firmer. In April 1846 he {{bought a house in}} Coney Street, central York, as a retirement home, and in December 1847 he formally resigned from the Council of the Royal Academy. Following structural alterations to give him a better view of the river, Etty moved into the house in June 1848, completing the move in September of that year, although he retained his London apartments. His move from London caused some consternation among that city's models, who were losing <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>most</b> regular customers, as well as concerns from Etty who was worried that working with nude models might cause a scandal in York.|$|E
5|$|In 1988–89 the Panthers enjoyed <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>most</b> {{successful}} seasons. They {{finished third}} in the league and were not only able to register their first win in the playoffs but also advance to the finals at Wembley for the first time. Nottingham met Whitley Warriors in the semi final, winning the match 8–6. In the final the following day the Panthers defeated the Ayr Bruins 6–3, clinching their first Championship title. Another Autumn Cup followed in 1991 but Dampier left the club during the 1992–93 season to join the newly formed Sheffield Steelers. He was replaced by Kevin Murphy who coached the team {{for the remainder of the}} campaign. Murphy was in turn replaced by Mike Blaisdell during the close season of 1993.|$|E
5|$|Manning was incensed {{that the}} British Council did not {{immediately}} find a job for Reggie, whom she considered <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>most</b> brilliant teachers. She took her revenge by writing scurrilous verse about the Council's representative, C.F.A. Dundas, later immortalised as the ineffectual Colin Gracey in Fortunes of War. Manning's characters were often based on real people though she never drew precisely from life. Her mocking portrait of the British Council lecturer Professor Lord Pinkrose was loosely based on Lord Dunsany, sent to occupy the Byron Chair of English at Athens University in 1940. She also resented that Amy Smart, wife of Walter Smart and frequent patron of artists, poets and writers in Cairo, paid so little attention to her and Reggie; she later took revenge in a similar way.|$|E

They have contested some close matches and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>most</b> notable matches was in the 2009 Wimbledon fourth round which Murray won in five sets {{and was the first}} men's match to be played under the Wimbledon roof, having the latest finish for a Wimbledon match at the time. Wawrinka also ended Murray's title defense at the 2013 US Open quarterfinals with a {{comfortable}} straight sets victory. Other close matches the two have contested include the 2010 US Open which Wawrinka won in four sets. Murray won the 2008 Canada Open and 2011 Shanghai Masters.|$|E
5|$|The First French Republic {{had long}} planned an {{invasion}} of the British Isles, but their ambitions had been repeatedly thwarted by other factors, including other fronts of the Revolutionary Wars, the War in the Vendée and the parlous state of the French Navy. This latter problem was a major cause for concern: the Navy had suffered heavily from the removal of its officer corps during the Revolution and then endured a series of military setbacks, culminating in the tactical defeat at the Glorious First of June in 1794 and the disastrous Croisière du Grand Hiver in 1795. After securing peace on several fronts in 1795, the new French Directory decided that Britain was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>most</b> dangerous remaining opponents, and they determined to defeat it through invasion.|$|E

They have also played festivals across the United States, including New York’s Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, The Folk Alliance Festival, the New England Folk Festival and Seattle’s Bumbershoot. The Paperboys have also performed at other music festivals, including Toronto's Harbourfront, the Milwaukee Irish Fest, and Wintergrass. The band has been asked to return almost every year to several festivals across Europe, headlining at the United Kingdom's Warwick and Trowbridge festivals, as well as at festivals in Germany and Denmark. The band has also toured in Switzerland, Norway, Scotland, Ireland, France, and Austria. According to Landa, their European travels are some of their most successful and popular performances, explaining why they travel to Europe so frequently for long musical tours.|$|E
