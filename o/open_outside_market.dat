50|$|Although {{the people}} of this tribe are not {{extremely}} rich they are not poor either. There were times way back about 200 to 300 years back when there were famines due to failure of crops but lately the economy of the tribe is strong enough. Although it may not reflect in the lifestyle of the people or the government records {{a close look at the}} possessions and individual earnings of the people prove the point. Every family has enough resources or means to sustain. Laziness has been the biggest obstacle in the economic growth of the tribe. Men folk are seldom involved in any aggressive pursuit of economy, it is the women in the tribe who play a dominating role in any economic activities. The recent 20 to 30 years have seen a massive growth of rich people in the tribe owing to exposure with outside world. The agricultural and horticultural productions having got potential passage to be supplied to <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>outside</b> of the state, it has contributed immensely to the affluence of the tribesmen.|$|R
40|$|For decades, the development, construction, track {{ownership}} {{and operation of}} mainline railways in China have been overseen by the state-owned authorities. From mid- 90 ’s, the mainline railway management has undergone revamps to revitalize the intra-modal competitiveness of railway transportation and to steer it toward the direction of modern business management. With the rapid economic growth; the large-scale expansion of the mainline network; and the increasing expectation on service, the mainline railways in China require further restructuring. Inevitably, a sustainable approach to ensure business viability and service quality {{in the next few}} decades is an imminent challenge. This paper reviews the operations and management of mainline railway in China and discusses the possibility of introducing open access market. Drawing the experiences on railway <b>open</b> <b>markets</b> <b>outside</b> China, the discussions include the need and feasibility of railway open market in China; and the suitability and limitations of different models. Particular considerations will be given to the unique characteristics of the mainline railways in China, where the developments across neighbouring regions are unbalanced; freight and passenger services are of similar demands; and the high-speed train operations are operated with low-speed ones in mixed traffic...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} flow of fund around the holding company (headquarters) of Mitsubishi Zaibatsu during the Second World War. From the late 1930 s, the Mitsubishi holding company started to raise fund from the <b>outside</b> capital <b>market</b> through selling the shares of its {{affiliated}} companies, and invested the fund to other affiliated companies. In this sense, Mitsubishi Zaibatsu was no more a semi-closed internal capital market {{as it used to}} be. In 1940, the holding company took another step, namely, public offering of its own shares. After that, while raising fund more from the <b>outside</b> <b>market,</b> it invested to wider range of firms.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the efficiency of}} the <b>outside</b> labor <b>market</b> in inducing optimal managerial behavior in the presence of learning. It shows that the incentives provided by the market can be more efficient than the original analysis of Holmström [6] would suggest. Moreover, under a mild additional assumption, the existence of an ε -efficient equilibrium can be guaranteed if a manager is patient. This result supports Fama's [4] original idea that the <b>outside</b> labor <b>market</b> can be efficient in disciplining top managers. These results also suggest that the empirically documented low levels of explicit incentives for managers might be due to the presence of implicit incentives provided by the <b>outside</b> <b>market.</b> Managerial labor market, Career concerns, Efficiency. ...|$|R
