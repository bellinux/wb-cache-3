5|$|After his Test debut, Hunt was {{expected}} to be the Queensland fullback in the first match of the three game State <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> series. However, Queensland selectors decided to stay with incumbent Origin fullback Matt Bowen. The selectors reconsidered after Queensland lost the first game, selecting Hunt for the second match. In his State <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> debut, Hunt ran with the ball seventeen times, making 196 metres. He missed the third Origin game because of a foot injury, sustained in the Broncos' Round 15 match, and was replaced by Clinton Schifcofske.|$|E
