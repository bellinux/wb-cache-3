5|$|Crop {{rotation}} is, {{however, the}} most important cultural control of L. decemlineata. Rotation may delay the infestation of potatoes and can reduce the build-up <b>of</b> <b>early</b> season beetle populations because the adults emerging from diapause can only disperse to new food sources by walking. One 1984 study showed that rotating potatoes with non-host plants reduced the density <b>of</b> <b>early</b> season adults by 95.8%.|$|E

All <b>of</b> <b>Early's</b> headquarters equipment was captured, as were 11 pieces of artillery.

5|$|Early Classic ceramic finds {{are scarce}} at Motul de San José {{and those that}} have been found were a minor {{component}} in mixed fill deposits.
