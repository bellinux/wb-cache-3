The reason, it would seem, was … because {{he was convinced that}} any split between the two would be exploited by the politicians to further their own agendas”.|$|E
25|$|Since {{there was}} so little {{literacy}} in northeastern Anatolia until the Persian and Hellenistic era, one can <b>only</b> <b>speculate</b> as to the other languages spoken here. Given that Kartvelian languages remain spoken {{to the east of}} Pontus, some are suspected to have been spoken in eastern Pontus during the Iron Age: the Tzans are usually associated with today's Laz.|$|E
25|$|By {{manoeuvring}} {{in close}} to Kormoran, Burnett removed the advantage provided by his longer-ranged primary armament, and put Sydney {{in a position where}} the raider's main guns could penetrate the cruiser's armour. Because there were no Australian survivors, Burnett's decision is inexplicable; writers on the subject can <b>only</b> <b>speculate</b> on his reasoning, and indicate what factors they believe influenced him. Up until the 1980s, most of the material published relating to the loss of Sydney accepted the German interpretation of events (that Burnett was deceived by Kormorans disguise, and placed his ship in a tactically unsound position) and assigned Burnett various levels of blame {{for his role in the}} cruiser's demise.|$|E

50|$|Much {{is known}} about the dynamic {{polymerization}} activities of tubulin and microtubules, but little {{is known about}} these activities in FtsZ. While it is known that single-stranded tubulin protofilaments form into 13 stranded microtubules, the multistranded structure of the FtsZ-containing Z-ring is not known. It is <b>only</b> <b>speculated</b> that the structure consists of overlapping protofilaments.|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth {{thought of}} it as for a moment she stood in the passage, and a cold hungry light came into her neutral tinted eyes and shone upon her pale face. But she choked back the thought; she was {{scarcely}} wicked enough to wish that her sister had not been brought back to life. She <b>only</b> <b>speculated</b> on what might have happened if this had come about, just as one works out a game of chess from a given hypothetical situation of the pieces.|$|R
25|$|The {{history of}} the Forcade-Biaix branch is {{complicated}} by the publication of false information concerning its origins in several affluent publications on the topic of nobility in Prussia and Europe. The first known publication of such information was in 1767, about 80 years after immigration in Prussia. The same information was reproduced in various forms in publications {{during the first half of}} the 19th century. One can <b>only</b> <b>speculate</b> if the information was knowingly furnished as false, or if it was the innocent result of confusing names that had been handed down verbally from two earlier generations already deceased. Claims published in the same publications that they held the rank of Marquis were, however, deliberately false.|$|E
25|$|Abhinavagupta {{remained}} unmarried all his life, we do however {{know him}} to be an adept of Kaula and as such, used his energy (ojas, or internally sublimated semen) as a vital force, {{a constant source of}} shakti to power the spiritual nervous system he outlined in his works. This system involves ritual union between Purusha as (Shiva) and shakti, yet this union is essentially non-physical and universal, and thus for a master such as Abhinavagupta, he was always in communion with Shiva-Shakti. We can <b>only</b> <b>speculate</b> about whether he was physically chaste, and either answer to this question is not very meaningful in the context of his life and teachings. Abhinavagupta parallels Shiva as both ascetic and enjoyer.|$|E
500|$|The two clearest {{examples}} of traditional power are {{the cases of}} [...] "kingly power" [...] and [...] "priestly power". Russell traces both back historically to certain roles which served some function in early societies. The priest is akin to the medicine man of a tribe, who {{is thought to have}} unique powers of cursing and healing at their disposal (Russell 1938:36). In most contemporary cases, priests rely on religious social movements grounded in charismatic authority, which have been more effective at usurping power than those religions that lack iconic founders (Russell 1938:39–40). The history of the king is more difficult to examine, and the researcher can <b>only</b> <b>speculate</b> on their origins. At the very least, the power of kingship seems to be advanced by war, even if warmaking was not the king's original function (Russell 1938:56).|$|E
5000|$|In systems ecology, {{researchers}} sometimes {{consider the}} exergy {{of the current}} formation of natural resources from {{a small number of}} exergy inputs (usually solar radiation, tidal forces, and geothermal heat). This application not only requires assumptions about reference states, but it also requires assumptions about the real environments of the past that might have been close to those reference states.

5000|$|Dollard {{originally}} {{wrote that}} {{he was unaware of}} how the term [...] "Dozens" [...] developed, although he suggested a popular twelve-part rhyme may have been the reason for its name. He <b>only</b> <b>speculated</b> on how the game itself grew to such prominence. Other authors following Dollard have added their theories. Author John Leland describes an etymology, writing that the term is a modern survival of an English verb—"to dozen"—dating back at least to the fourteenth century and meaning [...] "to stun, stupefy, daze" [...] or [...] "to make insensible, torpid, powerless".|$|R

500|$|Elliott {{argues that}} [...] "shamanism contributed to Manchu identity... by {{constructing}} a very obvious boundary between Manchu and Han." [...] Chinese residents and visitors, who {{were forbidden to}} observe the rituals performed at the shamanic shrine, saw these rites as [...] "different and mysterious" [...] or [...] "secret and alien." [...] A visitor to Beijing in the early Qing remarked that the Tangzi {{was one of the}} three things one didn't ask about in the capital. The difference between shamanic rites and Chinese rituals still [...] "aroused significant interest." [...] Korean visitors from Joseon, for instance, often [...] "asked questions about the secret Manchu rites in the Tangzi." [...] Writers who wanted to satisfy their readers' curiosity about these exotic practices could <b>only</b> <b>speculate</b> or rely on the late eighteenth-century Shamanic Code. This is why nineteenth-century Chinese accounts about Manchu rituals are [...] "fragmentary and often error-prone," [...] while their explanations of ritual language are [...] "positively confusing." ...|$|E
500|$|Lisa Henderson {{commented on}} the {{intersection}} between social class and gender in the film, particularly Brandon's working-class status: [...] "My reading of Boys [...] {{through the lens of}} class representation is not born of a univocal search for so-called positive images, but I do recoil at what appears {{to me to be a}} new instalment in a long history of popular images of working-class pathology. [...] But that is not the whole story. Within this universe of feeling and reaction structured by lack and tinted blue by country lyrics and a protective and threatening night-time light, characters imbricate gender and class through their longings for love, acceptance and a better life." [...] Jennifer Devere Brody {{commented on the}} film's exclusion of Philip DeVine, a disabled African-American man who was another victim of the shooting. [...] "Perhaps one can <b>only</b> <b>speculate</b> about the motivations behind this decision. But the effects are familiar ones in the history of racist representations.|$|E
500|$|On November 11, 2004, it was {{reported}} that a number of the inflatables had been stolen from Burger King roofs nationwide. Burger King chief marketing officer Russ Klein said, [...] "As to the motives behind these apparent 'spongenappings', we can <b>only</b> <b>speculate.</b> We did receive one ransom note related to an inflatable SpongeBob disappearance in Minnesota." [...] The chain offered a year's supply of Whopper sandwiches as a reward for information leading to the return of inflatables stolen in November. One was found attached to a railing at the football-field 50-yard line at an Iowa college, and another under a bed in Virginia. A ransom note was found for a third: [...] "We have SpongeBob. Give us 10 Krabby Patties, fries, and milkshakes." [...] Steven Simon and Conrad (C.J.) Mercure Jr. were arrested after stealing an inflatable from a Burger King in St. Mary's County, Maryland. While facing up to 18 months in jail and a $500 fine, Simon and Mercure said they were proud of what they did; Simon said, [...] "Once we got caught by the police, we were like, now we can tell everybody." [...] The following year Burger King took [...] "extra security precautions", when Stormtroopers from George Lucas' Star Wars guarded the delivery of Star Wars toys to a Burger King in North Hollywood.|$|E

25|$|The dark-coloured or melanic {{form of the}} {{peppered}} moth (var. carbonaria) was not known before 1811. After field collection in 1848 from Manchester, an industrial city in England, {{the frequency of the}} variety was found to have increased drastically. By the end of the 19th century it almost completely outnumbered the original light-coloured type (var. typica), with a record of 98% in 1895. The evolutionary importance of the moth was <b>only</b> <b>speculated</b> upon during Darwin's lifetime. It was 14 years after Darwin's death, in 1896, that J.W. Tutt presented it as a case of natural selection. Due to this, the idea widely spread, and more people believed in Darwin's theory.|$|R
30|$|AgNPs can be {{ingested}} by H. azteca, {{independent of}} {{their degree of}} transformation. It can be <b>only</b> <b>speculated</b> whether ingested AgNPs are bioavailable, e.g., by formation and adsorption of Ag+ in the gut, and how {{and to what extent}} they contribute to the body burden. Animals collected {{at the end of the}} study were not kept under control conditions for a certain time to evacuate their gut contents. The measured body burden of the animals may therefore partly represent ingested AgNPs. Further studies are required to elucidate the dietary uptake and accumulation of AgNPs by H. azteca, as well as to clarify the order of magnitude of gut contents contributing to the measured body burden.|$|R
500|$|When {{originally}} used in Olney, it {{is unknown}} what music, if any, accompanied the verses written by John Newton. Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune [...] "Hephzibah" [...] by English composer John Jenkins Husband. Common meter hymns were interchangeable {{with a variety of}} tunes; more than twenty musical settings of [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named [...] "New Britain", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies ("Gallaher" [...] and [...] "St. Mary") first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's Centre College, compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy [...] "the wants of the Church in her triumphal march". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but [...] "Gallaher" [...] and [...] "St. Mary" [...] had not. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can <b>only</b> <b>speculate</b> that they are possibly of British origin. A manuscript from 1828 by Lucius Chapin, a famous hymn writer of that time, contains a tune very close to [...] "St. Mary", {{but that does not mean}} that he wrote it.|$|E

2500|$|At the onset, the NTSB {{determined}} that the captain had flown an unstable approach, descending steeply and {{too close to the}} runway. As a result, the captain would not have had sufficient time to correct problems as they arose. Furthermore, the plane's flaps were found to be in the up position, which is improper procedure. The NTSB could <b>only</b> <b>speculate</b> that either the pilots forgot to set the flaps or that they incorrectly retracted the flaps while attempting to go-around. The flap setting error could have contributed to a stall.|$|E
40|$|The Qing Period (1644 – 1911) {{has been}} {{recognised}} {{as one of}} the most important eras in China’s demographic history. However, factors that determined and contributed to the rise in the Qing population have remained unclear. Most works so far have <b>only</b> <b>speculated</b> at what might have caused the population to increase so significantly during the Qing Period. This study uses substantial amounts of quantitative evidence to investigate the impact of changes in China’s resource base (farmland), farming technology (rice yield level and spread of maize-farming), social welfare (disaster relief), peasant wealth (rice prices), cost of living (silver’s purchasing power), as well as exogenous shocks (wars and natural disasters) on the Qing population...|$|R
40|$|The {{main idea}} of this {{bachelor}} thesis is to close the phylogenetic relation of Homo neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens species issue.

Both ships featured technology thought to have been developed historically much later. It has been stated that the emperor was influenced by the lavish lifestyles of the Hellenistic rulers of Syracuse and Ptolemaic Egypt. Recovered from the lake bed in 1929, the ships were destroyed by artillery fire during World War II in 1944.|$|R
2500|$|The {{book was}} priced at one drachma, {{far below the}} cost of production, and {{immediately}} began to sell steadily. [...] There were no public protests or demonstrations.

2500|$|The {{ubiquity of}} cameras and on-line photos since {{the rise of}} {{cellphone}} cameras and personal websites is actively changing the tradition of family photos and photo albums. The availability of video recordings and teleconferencing allows for a daily log of family growth and minutiae to be saved and transmitted to family near and far, in real time. Grandparents can get a daily or weekly update on children's growth or milestone events. Family members can video-conference with each other, making geographic distance much less significant in family relations.

2500|$|In a June 1960 {{letter to}} Allen Ginsberg, Kerouac {{said that he}} was pleased that Burroughs had {{credited}} him with the title. He states that Ginsberg misread [...] "Naked Lust" [...] from the manuscript, and only he noticed. Kerouac did not specify which manuscript and critics could <b>only</b> <b>speculate</b> until 2003 when Burroughs scholar Oliver Harris established that, in his Lower East Side apartment in fall 1953, Ginsberg had been reading aloud to Kerouac from the manuscript of Queer, which Burroughs had just brought with him from Mexico City. For the next five years, Burroughs used the title to refer to a three-part work made up of 'Junk,' 'Queer' and 'Yage,' corresponding to his first three manuscripts, before it came to describe the book later published as Naked Lunch, which was based largely on his 1957 'Interzone' manuscript.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{accepted}} by most historians that first contact by Europeans {{was made by}} Giovanni da Verrazzano, an Italian explorer who entered the bay in his ship La Dauphine in 1524 after visiting New York Bay. Verrazzano called the bay Refugio, the [...] "Refuge". It has several entrances, however, and historians can <b>only</b> <b>speculate</b> as to the exact route of his voyage and the location where he laid anchor, along with a corresponding uncertainty over which tribe made contact with him. Verrazzano reported that he found clearings and open forests suitable for travel [...] "even by a large army," [...] {{a far cry from}} the impenetrable tangle that resulted when the English suppressed controlled burns in the seventeenth century.

2500|$|The Thetford assemblage, {{in spite}} of the sadly {{inadequate}} details of its discovery and provenance, {{remains one of the most}} intriguing and unusual of the many late-Roman precious-metal hoards from Britain. [...] Although the combination of silver tableware and gold personal ornament (with or without coins) is common enough in precious-metal hoards of this period from Britain, the fact that the inscriptions, supported by the visual imagery, allude to pagan, rather than Christian, belief towards the end of the 4th century, is important. [...] Attempts have been made to interpret the hoard as Christian, but remain somewhat unconvincing when applied to objects current at a period when paganism, rather than Christianity, was out of favour. In the present state of knowledge, we can still <b>only</b> <b>speculate</b> about the status of the objects, that is, whether they belonged to an individual or family, or to some organisation, such as a religious one.|$|E

[...] Ross and visual effects supervisor Sheena Duggal were keen to use the omniscient view that the setting provided to justify the literal dei ex machina Katniss experiences in the arena; Duggal explained that [...] "we really didn't want to have to explain things... how do you get compelled by these [...] that just appear {{at the end of the}} movie?
