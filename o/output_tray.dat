5000|$|The {{shockwave}} {{of light}} spreads {{to cover the}} entire Earth, then grows in brightness and intensity such that it causes the entire screen to remain white for a few seconds. This effect ends with a fade to the printer in Alexander's facility, the <b>output</b> <b>tray</b> of which bears a freshly-printed page with Rostenburg's final code, deciphered as follows: [...] "0000 ... Dawn of New Millennium".|$|E
5000|$|A {{feature of}} the 4+, and 4Si {{particularly}} dear to graphic designers was the straight paper feed. Unusually thick paper could be run through the printers without jamming by setting the <b>output</b> <b>tray</b> to [...] "Lower (face up)" [...] and having it come {{out the back of}} the printer. (Note: This is not a {{feature of the}} original 1992 Laserjet 4.) Similar models of earlier HP laser printers had this feature, but it became less common with the later models.|$|E
5000|$|Copiers {{typically}} feed {{paper from}} a roll, {{where it is}} given a static electric charge, after which it is exposed to light reflected from the original document, and focused through a lens; zinc oxide particles either preserve or discharge the electric charge, depending {{on the amount of}} light reaching them. After exposure, the paper is passed through a toner station: toner is typically carbon black suspended in an organic liquid known as a dispersant, then spread over the paper. Black toner particles adhere to areas on the paper that remain charged; discharged areas do not attract toner particles. A knife then cuts the paper to the proper length (typically letter or legal size). The subsequently independent sheet of paper then passes from the toner station, where excess dispersant is wiped off. Typically, the paper is finally sent to an <b>output</b> <b>tray</b> where any remaining dispersant evaporates, leaving copies with a faint [...] "kerosene" [...] odor.|$|E

5000|$|A great {{advantage}} of digital copier technology is [...] "automatic digital collation." [...] For example, when copying {{a set of}} 20 pages 20 times, a digital copier scans each page only once, then uses the stored information to produce 20 sets. In an analog copier, either each page is scanned 20 times (a total of 400 scans), making one set at a time, or 20 separate <b>output</b> <b>trays</b> are used for the 20 sets.|$|R
40|$|Dala Energi Elnät is {{a smaller}} grid company with network {{operations}} {{consisting of the}} distri-bution and measurement of electricity. The company is interested in acquiring greater know-ledge of the error detection equipment that can in a early stage detect errors in the medium-voltage network. Which hopefully results in faster fault location and cost savings for the company. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the fault-detection equipment that would fit into the Dala Energys medium voltage grid and what experiences others electricity companies have with fault-detection equipment. Fault detection equipment used in the study has been limited to equipment from the companies Protrol AB and dLaboratory AB. Structure and function of the equipment are investigated and empirical experience obtained through a telephone interview and a visit on the electricity network companies Kraftringen respectively Falu Elnät AB. Protrols fault-detection equipment consists of error detectors that measure only the current for detecting ground faults and over currents and mainly used in substations. Communication to the control center can be made by fiber, Ethernet or signal cable. The simplest detectors have no communication link without signals with LED indicator on the substation if the fault current passed. Configuration, settings, and registered error events must be downloaded by USB connection on site. dLaboratorys concept is that the industrial PC installed in a distribution substation, where the current and voltage are measured in each <b>output</b> <b>tray,</b> to detect ground faults and overcurrents. Relay Protection functions are available on the PC, which means that both fault detection and protection equipment available. Information from the measurements sent to dLaboratorys serves for analysis and transmitted to power grid owner. On dLaboratorys website the information can then be reviewed with a convenient interface. Selection of fault-detection equipment is affected by electricity network design with radial or meshed networks, existing grid equipment, relay protection, geographical distance and communication facilities etc. Where a comprehensive solution from a longer term perspective should be taken into account. Recording options in error-detection equipment can be used to better understand the reasons why a protection relay trips, where the events before and after the fault can be analyzed. A financial investment in fault-detection equipment do not always pay for itself, but also provides greater customer benefits and opportunities to identify weak points in the grid. Benefiting from successful experience of other grid companies have had with fault-detection equipment. For the fault-detection equipment included in the study, recommended Protrols equipment to be used on radial parts of the network, where the error detectors are not placed in each substation but strategically where geographical distances are great to reduce troubleshooting time substantially. dLaboratorys fault detection equipment is best suited to distribution stations with many exhausting tray and where it is possible that if sectioning out the fault with remote-controlled switch or circuit breaker. dLaboratory relay protection has worked well in conducted tests on the other hand it remains to be seen how it manages in normal operation.
