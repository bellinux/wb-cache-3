5|$|Diffusion {{may also}} have had a {{significant}} effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> primordial cosmic magnetic fields, fields which may have been amplified over time to become galactic magnetic fields. However, these cosmic magnetic fields may have been damped by radiative diffusion: just as acoustic oscillations in the plasma were damped by the diffusion of photons, so were magnetosonic waves (waves of ions travelling through a magnetised plasma). This process began before the era of neutrino decoupling and ended at the time of recombination.|$|E

5|$|The K–Pg {{extinction}} had {{a profound}} effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> life on Earth. The elimination of dominant Cretaceous groups allowed other organisms to take their place, spurring a remarkable series of adaptive radiations in the Paleogene. The most striking example is the replacement of dinosaurs by mammals. After the K–Pg extinction, mammals evolved rapidly to fill the niches left vacant by the dinosaurs. Also significant, within the mammalian genera, new species were approximately 9.1% larger after the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{selection}} {{may have}} played a role in the diversification of skin color and pattern in poison frogs. With female preferences in play, male coloration could evolve rapidly. Sexual selection is influenced by many things. The parental investment may shed some light <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> coloration in relation to female choice. In Oophaga pumilio, the female provides care for the offspring for several weeks whereas the males provides care for a few days, implying a strong female preference. Sexual selection increases phenotypic variation drastically. In populations of O. pumilio that participated in sexual selection, the phenotypic polymorphism was evident. The lack of sexual dimorphism in some dendrobatid populations however suggests that sexual selection is not a valid explanation.|$|E

5|$|Winckelmann’s {{theories}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> art {{culminated in}} the Sublime period of Greek art, which had been conceived {{during a period of}} complete political and religious liberty. The theories idealised Ancient Greece and increased people’s desire to travel to contemporary Greece. It was seductive to believe, as he did, that 'good taste' was born beneath the Greek sky. He convinced 18th-century Europe that life in Ancient Greece was pure, simple and moral, and that classical Hellas was the source from which artists should draw ideas of “noble simplicity and calm grandeur”. Greece became the “motherland of the arts” and “the teacher of taste”.|$|E

25|$|A social {{networks}} perspective <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> large scale interfirm organizational networks was presented by Braha et al. who propose micro-dynamic models that reproduce actual large-scale interfirm perceived competition networks. Several evolutionary mechanisms of organizational networks are identified: spatial locations of firms are {{positively correlated with}} the population density; interfirm competition is governed by cumulative advantage rules and geographic distance; and competition network formation and firm size dynamics are closely intertwined.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} the welding {{mechanical}} heterogeneity <b>on</b> <b>the</b> damage <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> notched round-bar tensile specimens were investigated numerically using a fully coupled elastic-plastic damage finite element method. Some parameters reflecting the welding mechanical heterogeneity such as strength mismatching, rupture strain and weld metal width were taken into account to study their effects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> damage <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weld metal. The calculation results show that <b>the</b> damage <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weld metal is affected strongly by the welding mechanical heterogeneity. <b>The</b> damage <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weld metal becomes larger with the decrease of both the rupture strain and yielding stress of the base metal.
