40|$|In {{order to}} achieve the largest laser intensities, a plasma might {{be used as the}} {{amplification}} medium, thereby avoiding the material limits of conventional materials. The technique considered is resonant backward Raman amplification in plasma, wherein a short counter-propagating seed pulse, with frequency downshifted from a long pump pulse by the plasma frequency, absorbs the pump energy through a resonant decay interaction of the two counter-propagating light waves and a plasma wave. In the pump-depletion regime, the counter-propagating seed pulse assumes a self-contracting self-similar form, capturing the pump energy in a pulse of far shorter duration. This technique encounters limitations both at high laser seed <b>output</b> <b>intensities</b> and high pump laser intensities. At high seed <b>output</b> <b>intensities,</b> there are modulation instabilities that break up the output seed.

40|$|We {{applied the}} optimal control theory to {{substantially}} reduce transition times between in-phase and out-of-phase states in coupled solid state lasers. The {{control is a}} time-varying optical field that is injected into the cavities of each laser. Numerical simulations indicate that the transient times can be reduced by {{an order of magnitude}} when increasing briefly the injection strength by a factor of three. Laser arrays are promising for space communication applications. Such applications require compact sources with high optical intensities and fast switching times [1]. Recently, both solid state and semiconductor laser arrays have been investigated, and various relevant aspects of their dynamical behavior such as chaotic synchronization, chaotic communication, and amplitude drop-out have already been reported. The most efficient mode of operation of the array is realized when its elements are synchronized to an in-phase (IP) state, such that the output interferes constructively and the light intensity at the central lobe scales as N 2, where N is the number of lasers in the array. Unfortunately, the IP state is unstable; in general, the system is driven to the stable out-of-phase (OP) state, whose destructive interference pattern results in low <b>output</b> <b>intensities</b> at the central lobe. The IP behavior can be stabilized by injecting a common driving field into the laser array elements.

The individual phase of the light waves in each mode is not fixed, and may vary randomly due to such things as thermal changes in materials of the laser.
