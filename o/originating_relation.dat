50|$|Opheliamachine is a postmodernist drama by the Polish-born American {{playwright and}} dramaturg, Magda Romanska. Written {{in the span}} of ten years, from 2002 to 2012, the play is a {{response}} to and polemic with the German playwright Heiner Mueller’s Hamletmachine (in German, Die Hamletmaschine). Like Hamletmachine, Opheliamachine is loosely based on Hamlet, by William Shakespeare. The play <b>originated</b> in <b>relation</b> to Romanska’s doctoral dissertation on representation of death and femininity.|$|R

50|$|Hamletmachine (in German, Die Hamletmaschine) is a postmodernist drama by German {{playwright and}} theatre {{director}} Heiner Müller. Written in 1977, {{the play is}} loosely based on Hamlet by William Shakespeare. The play <b>originated</b> in <b>relation</b> to a translation of Shakespeare's Hamlet that Müller undertook. Some critics claim the play problematizes the role of intellectuals during the East German Communism area; others argue that the play should be understood in relation to wider post-modern concepts.

50|$|This social-cultural {{perspective}} {{is derived from}} the Vygotskian view that higher cognitive functions <b>originate</b> in <b>relations</b> between individuals. The strict version of this view is that these functions are social actions that have been internalized. Pointing, according to Vygotsky, starts out as an attempt to grab a desired object. Then, a transitional gesture develops in which the individual reaches toward the object when it is desired as a cue to another to retrieve it. This transitional gesture, says Vygotsky, is an important step toward language in that participation in these social interactions are internalized and become an understanding of the psychological functions of others. Thus, pointing {{is an example of the}} internalization process that occurs over a long series of developmental events. These gestures help children to gain an understanding of triadic interactions, as the gestures go from being simply about the objects to being specifically directed at people and conveying intention toward others.|$|R

40|$|Europa’s {{chaos and}} lenticulae {{may have been}} <b>originated</b> in <b>relation</b> to thermal diapirs linked to {{convective}} upwellings. Thermal convection and diapirism starts if the ice shell is thicker than a critical value (with details depending on the dominant ice rheology, grain size, and intensity of tidal straining). Previously to the onset of convection, possible biological forms living in, or close to, the shell/ocean interphase could result trapped and dormant in ice, due to satellite cooling and thickening of the ice shell. Some biological substances are used to optimize cellular functioning under low water activity conditions, such as low temperature and high osmotic conditions. Trehalose is an example that is frequent in halophilic microorganisms, which could be present on Europa. This kind of compounds can reduce the water melting point to ~ 230 K, a temperature similar to that at the stagnant lid base. Thus, the onset of thermal diapirism could cause an event of reactivation of dormant biological forms close {{to the base of}} the stagnant lid, since diapirs may warm the neighbor ice by tens of thousand of years...|$|R

As this would often recur, and as nerve-force readily passes along accustomed channels, a slight irritation would ultimately suffice to cause a free secretion of tears.|$|R

It is conjectured that an iterative application of this conversion procedure to finite families of polytopes results in a cycle of length at most two.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} interlingual lexical {{homonymy}} in the Croatian and Belarusian languages. The {{core of the}} thesis is a Croatian-Belarusian dictionary of homonyms. The preceding, theoretical part focuses first on the denomination of the linguistic phenomenon of interlingual homonymy and on the existing research {{in the sphere of}} homonymy among the Slavic languages. A following section of the thesis is devoted to the various types of intralingual and interlingual homonyms and to some differences in their classification. The thesis also looks at the ways in which interlingual homonyms <b>originate,</b> in <b>relation</b> to the origin of the lexical units that make pairs of homonyms. Two principal ways in which pairs of homonyms can originate are described: coincidental formal agreement and agreement as a result of common development or of the borrowing of the same foreign word. Depending on their origin, homonyms are divided into pairs representing the common Slavic lexical stock and pairs of foreign origin. The next part of the thesis presents the principles under which lexicographic material for the dictionary was collected, the lexicographic sources used in the process, and the structure of the dictionary entries. The dictionary of Croatian-Belarusian interlingual homonyms contains 1, 048 entries, which represent all [...] ...|$|R

It is made entirely from information found on the worldwide web and was specially commissioned by Brighton Photo-biennial 2012. October is a portrait of a protest movement - one that rapidly propagated itself across the world through its use of the Internet, replicating its own language, methods and behaviours worldwide to encompass a diverse range of issues surrounding social and economic inequality. On one gallery wall, a short documentary montage focuses on two key events -the global day of action that took place on October 15 th 2011, where Occupy Wall Street spread almost spontaneously to over 900 cities worldwide, and then a systematic crackdown on many of the camps that had emerged taking place from November 2011.

For all but very simple cases the patterns are not understandable because the textual descriptions are lengthy and unstructured. We present the Time Series Knowledge Representation (TSKR), a new hierarchical language for interval patterns to express the temporal concepts of coincidence and partial order.

Such an abstraction, a special case of domain abstraction, comes down to a change in granularity: extensions are now considered as union of abstract instances, i. e. union of predefined subsets of instances.

Planation surfaces are the most debatable and vague landforms and can be defined as parts of terrain formed by long-lasting erosion-denudation processes under the stagnant erosion base conditions. In terms of denudation chronology they can be considered as morphological indicators of different evolution stages of area. In karst areas planation surfaces and river terraces are mostly correlated with cave levels, which <b>originated</b> in <b>relation</b> to the same stagnant erosion base. Because there is no general method of delineation of planation surfaces, the main objective of the study was to find a suitable method for semi-automated recognition of flat landforms in the Aggtelek Karst, which should correspond to different phases of the Jósva River incision and therefore could be correlated to the multilevel cave system of the study area. Several methods for semi-automated landform classification were tested for recognition of flat surfaces in a relatively objective way. Slope gradient thresholding tool, and r. param. scale and r. geomorphon modules implemented in GRASS GIS were tested. As a result, the r. geomorphon module was proven as the most suitable method for delineation of relatively flat surfaces.
