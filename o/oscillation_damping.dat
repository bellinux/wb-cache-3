40|$|One of {{the main}} {{drawbacks}} of the existing <b>oscillation</b> <b>damping</b> controllers that are designed based on offline dynamic models is adaptivity to the power system operating condition.

Such a model could capture all dominant oscillation modes for adaptive and coordinated <b>oscillation</b> <b>damping</b> control. This paper describes a comprehensive approach to identify a low-order transfer function model of a power system using a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) autoregressive moving average exogenous (ARMAX) model.

The proposed method is validated by using ambient data and ring-down data in the 16 -machine 68 -bus Northeast Power Coordinating Council system. The results demonstrate that the measurementbased model using MIMO ARMAX can capture all the dominant oscillation modes. Compared with the MIMO subspace state space model, the MIMO ARMAX model has equivalent accuracy but lower order and improved computational efficiency.

Power and frequency <b>oscillation</b> <b>damping</b> mechanism improve the reliability. Because of power system stabilizer (PSS) low speed response against of major fault such as three phase short circuit, FACTs devise that can control the network condition in very fast time, are becoming popular. But FACTs capability can be seen in a major fault present when nonlinear models of FACTs devise and power system equipment are applied. To realize this aim, the model of multi-machine power system with FACTs controller is developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK using Sim Power System (SPS) blockiest. Among the FACTs device, Static synchronous series compensator (SSSC) due to high speed changes its reactance characteristic inductive to capacitive, is effective power flow controller.

Both families of methods {{are based on the}} formulation of the control problem as a discrete-time optimal control problem. The considered MPC approach exploits an analytical model of the system dynamics and cost function and computes open-loop policies by applying an interior-point solver to a minimization problem in which the system dynamics are represented by equality constraints. The considered RL approach infers in a model-free way closed-loop policies from a set of system trajectories and instantaneous cost values by solving a sequence of batch-mode supervised learning problems.
