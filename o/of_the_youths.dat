25|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>youths</b> {{who becomes}} {{a member of the}} Legion is Lar Gand, a {{teenager}} whom Superboy first knows as Mon-El when he crash-lands on Earth in Superboy's era. The teenager, who has powers identical to Superboy, initially has amnesia, and because he carries a message from Jor-El, Superboy believes him to be his big brother and dubs him Mon-El. When Mon-El is exposed to lead, his memory returns. He reveals that he is actually a Daxamite named Lar Gand, and for Daxamites, lead is more deadly than Kryptonite. To save his life, Superboy projects Mon-El into the Phantom Zone, where Mon-El would linger for a millennium before being freed by the Legion. In the Legion, the two teens remain close friends. The alternate Superboy from the Pocket Universe would die in Mon-El's arms.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} praised for its {{political}} satire. Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict called the episode a [...] "biting political satire {{in the guise}} of a children's oratory contest", that [...] "signifies that this season of the series will be all over the map, both emotionally and logically." [...] Gibron added: [...] "Everything, from the Reader's Digest rants to the formulaic speeches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>youths,</b> has a resounding ring of truth. And once the story moves to Washington D.C, our nation's capital is in for a royal reaming as well." [...] Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend said the episode solidified the series' politically satirical voice as it [...] "bitch slapped the Bush administration" [...] that would later badmouth The Simpsons. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson, however, gave the episode a more negative review, stating that it [...] "has its moments but never seems like one of the series’ better programs. Part of that stems from its somewhat icky ending. The show exhibits a tone that feels more appropriate to a less biting and cynical series. It starts well with Homer’s obsession with Reading Digest. After that, the show seems more erratic, and it remains pretty average overall." ...|$|E

A third friend, Tunny, joins the two and they party until they run out of beer, prompting them to pick up more at the local 7-Eleven. Tunny soon exposes the do-nothing go-nowhere quicksand of their lives ("City of the Damned"). They get riled up, and Johnny challenges his friends to engage ("I Don't Care"). Will's girlfriend, Heather, soon makes an appearance. She is pregnant and doesn't know what to do ("Dearly Beloved"). Johnny borrows money and buys bus tickets to the city for the three young men, eager to escape suburbia. Before the boys are able to leave, Heather tells Will of her pregnancy. With no other choice, he stays home ("Tales of Another Broken Home"). Johnny and Tunny depart for the city with a group of other jaded youths ("Holiday").|$|E
