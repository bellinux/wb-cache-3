5|$|The Atlanta Journal {{wrote that}} {{a crowd of}} men, women, and {{children}} arrived on foot, in cars, and on horses, and that souvenir hunters cut away parts <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> sleeves. According to The New York Times, one of the onlookers, Robert E. Lee Howellrelated to Clark Howell, editor of The Atlanta Constitutionwanted to have the body cut into pieces and burned, and began to run around, screaming, whipping up the mob. Judge Newt Morris tried to restore order, {{and asked for a}} vote on whether the body should be returned to the parents intact; only Howell disagreed. When the body was cut down, Howell started stamping on Frank's face and chest; Morris quickly placed the body in a basket, and he and his driver John Stephens Wood drove it out of Marietta.|$|E
5|$|In the 2009 close season, {{there were}} rumours linking Žigić with moves to clubs {{including}} Sunderland, Monaco, and Bordeaux, but the player insisted his intention was and {{always had been}} to be successful with Valencia. He made 26 appearances for the club in 2009–10 in all competitions, {{more than in the}} previous two seasons combined, but only 5 were league starts. Within four minutes of replacing the injured David Villa in the league match against Racing in October, he took advantage of a defensive error to score the only goal of the game; out of respect for his former club, he did not celebrate. On 2 January 2010, his 93rd-minute header against Espanyol took Valencia third in the table, and his double against Deportivo La Coruña in the 2009–10 Copa del Rey put Valencia 2–0 up at half-time; the game finished 2–2 and Valencia lost 4–3 on aggregate. With four minutes left of the Europa League quarter-final second leg, Valencia were denied a penalty when an Atlético Madrid defender pulled Žigić to the ground so forcefully that a large hole was torn in the front <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt,</b> apparently unnoticed by referee or goalline official; the tie ended goalless, so Atlético progressed on away goals from the first leg and {{went on to win the}} competition. Away to Espanyol on 1 May, again as a substitute for Villa, he scored both goals in a 2–0 win that secured Valencia a place in the next season's Champions League.|$|E
25|$|On 8 January 2017, {{making his}} first start for Chelsea since an EFL Cup defeat to West Ham United in October 2016, Terry was given a {{straight}} red card for a foul on Lee Angol as Chelsea beat Peterborough United 4–1 in the FA Cup third round. On 17 April, {{he announced that he}} would be leaving Chelsea {{at the end of the}} 2016–17 season. After Chelsea celebrated their Premier League victory, Terry played his 717th and final match for Chelsea on 21 May in a 5–1 home win over Sunderland, coming off in the 28th minute (the substitution board went up in the 26th minute, the same as that <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> number), and received a guard of honour from his teammates.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> humour, {{but also}} because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{athletic}} achievements and his combative playing style, Klinsmann quickly became extremely popular in England; over 150,000 <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirts</b> were sold. He now holds legendary status at Spurs and was inducted into Madame Tussauds Wax Museum.|$|R
50|$|On 1 January 2017, Nike {{announced}} that Day was joining Nike Golf {{ahead of the}} SBS Tournament of Champions at Kapalua the following week. It was {{announced that}} he will wear Nike clothes, shoes and gloves, following the brand's decision to stop making clubs and balls. Nike Golf unveiled a commercial to announce the multi-year sponsorship deal worth a reported $10m a year. Day was known to have the RBC logo on the collar <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirts,</b> but because Nike does not allow other sponsorships to be seen on their apparel, his sponsorship contract with RBC was not renewed. He continues to wear the Lexus logo on the left sleeve <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirts,</b> as he previously did before using Nike apparel.|$|R

25|$|While {{the main}} event saw two of CMLL's top Rudo factions face off as La Peste Negra faced off against Los Invasores, the storyline {{centered}} more around the building rivalry between Mr. Niebla of La Peste Negra and Volador Jr. of Los Invasores. At the previous week's Super Viernes the two had teamed up, but due to infighting between the two their team lost the match. Mr. Niebla allied himself with El Felino and Negro Casas while Volador Jr. teamed up with Mr. Águila and Psicosis, pitting two experienced teams against each other. La Peste Negra took the first fall, while Los Invasores cheated their way to taking the second fall. During the third fall Mr. Niebla began tearing Volador Jr.'s super hero inspired outfit apart, almost stripping Volador Jr. <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> as well as tearing at Volador Jr.'s mask. After {{a long period of}} the advantage switching {{back and forth between the}} two teams La Peste Negra distracted the referee, allowing Mr. Niebla to use an illegal low blow on Volador Jr. and pin him for the third and final fall. After the match an enraged Volador Jr. openly challenged Mr. Niebla to aLucha de Apuestas match where both wrestlers would risk their Masks. Like the previous week Mr. Niebla declined the challenge at that point in time.|$|E
500|$|The song's lyrics {{describe}} a magical date. Like many of Swift's songs, the lyrics invoke princess imagery with lines such as [...] "Today was a fairytale/ You were the prince/ I {{used to be}} a damsel in distress." [...] Bertoldi said the lyrics were [...] "driven more by sweeping emotion than [...] specific, youth-focused imagery". Occasionally, Swift does interrupt the fairytale construct with modern day, real world details like the time her date arrives or the color <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt.</b>|$|E
500|$|After some time, Jenner {{joined the}} Royal Navy, but deserted in New York City, United States. He soon joined the United States Navy. Jenner's {{daughter}} stated {{in an interview}} after his death that {{he learned how to}} gamble during this time and he soon developed the impulse control disorder of problem gambling. He became particularly attached to the game craps, which was popular in the United States at the time. He started to keep a rabbit's foot in the left upper pocket <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt,</b> and would rub it with his left hand while he rolled the dice with his right. His shipmates therefore began calling him [...] "Bones", a nickname that he retained {{for the rest of his}} navy career.|$|E

500|$|Audio {{tracks were}} mixed with {{recorded}} sounds from real subway cars, {{as well as}} PA system announcements, to make the episode sound more authentic. In the original episode, Pembleton grabbed Biedron by the collar <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> while Biedron {{sat in the back}} of a squad car during one of the final scenes. The scene was modified so that Pembleton only looked at Biedron, because Yoshimura felt that the scene was just as effective without him grabbing Biedron. During the last scene of the episode, in which Lange's girlfriend jogs by the subway station and ignores the emergency vehicles, Rabinowitz was originally instructed to include a musical score. He tried many different types of music, including rock music, Irish music, classical music, jazz, and piano riffs. When none of the music worked, Fontana suggested including no music at all, and it was agreed the silence was the most effective solution. Fontana said that after watching the episode repeatedly during the editing process, he liked the final product but doubted he would watch it again for a long time because it was [...] "too emotionally draining".|$|E

5000|$|Hathaway's {{original}} {{name was}} Jameson Babcock, and {{he grew up}} in Chester, Pennsylvania. In his youth, he was given the nickname Nick, which is short for [...] "nickname." [...] When he started writing songs, the name clicked, because he got most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ideas by borrowing (or [...] "nicking") from songwriters with talent. His stage name Hathaway came from the label <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirts</b> or a shirt he borrowed (or [...] "nicked") from a friend.|$|R

2500|$|In April 1987, Purdy and his {{half-brother}} Albert {{were arrested}} for firing a semi-automatic pistol at trees in the Eldorado National Forest. At the time, {{he was carrying a}} book about the white supremacist group Aryan Nations. He told the County Sheriff that it was his [...] "duty to help the suppressed and overthrow the suppressor." [...] In prison he twice attempted suicide, once by hanging himself with a rope made out of strips <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt,</b> and a second time by cutting his wrists with his fingernails. A subsequent psychiatric assessment found him to suffer from very mild mental retardation, and to be a danger to himself and others.|$|E
2500|$|Hussey has the {{nickname}} Mr Cricket, {{due to his}} encyclopaedic knowledge of his sport. He has repeatedly stated that he dislikes {{the nickname}} finding it [...] "a bit embarrassing". England rival Andrew Flintoff and Graeme Swann's brother Alec were reportedly responsible for coining it. The soubriquet appeared on the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> in the Twenty20 international against South Africa in 2006, {{in which all the}} players displayed their nicknames. During the 2007 Twenty20 against England, however, he was seen with [...] "Huss" [...] on his shirt instead, further suggesting he is fed up with the tag Mr Cricket. Nevertheless, the nickname features prominently in his television ads for the national real estate chain L.J. Hooker.|$|E

[...] He soon had it as by a spell. [...] I never saw men more delighted. [...] He began to bubble out with humor. [...] For plain pungency of humor, it would have been difficult to surpass his speech. [...] The speech ended in a half-hour. [...] The bell that called to the steam cars sounded. [...] Mr. Lincoln instantly stopped. [...] ‘I am engaged to speak at Cambridge tonight, and I must leave.’ [...] The whole audience seemed to rise in protest. [...] ‘Go on! [...] Finish it!’ was heard on every hand. [...] One gentleman arose and pledged to take his horse and carry him across country. [...] But Mr. Lincoln was inexorable.|$|E
2500|$|The WPA also interviewed {{another former}} slave, Lucinda Vann, who {{told a story}} about Jim Vann, an {{engineer}} or fireman aboard the steamboat who was forced by Captain Vann at gunpoint to toss slabs of meat into the boiler since the fat was supposed to superheat the boiler water and thus increase steam pressure. Vann had been drinking, and was engaged in a race to New Orleans with a steamboat that had left Louisville with the Lucy Walker [...] [...] It is known from sailing notices in a Louisville newspaper that the steamboat Minerva was scheduled to depart for New Orleans {{at the same time}} as Lucy Walker. [...] According to Lucinda Vann's account, Jim Vann threw in the meat into the firebox, and then leaped overboard just before the boilers exploded [...] [...] Essentially the same story was also told by Robert P. Vann, grandson of [...] "Rich Joe." [...] R.P. Vann talked with, but did not name the Negro fireman, who was supposed to be the only survivor of the explosion. [...] Also killed in the explosion was 20-year-old Preston Mackey, uncle of Robert P. Vann and son-in-law of [...] "Rich Joe". Lucinda Vann recounted that an arm of Preston Mackey was recovered (recognized by the design <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> sleeve) and placed in an alcohol-filled container and sent to Webber's Falls. [...] There a doctor would occasionally display poor Mackey's appendage for the curious (including Lucinda Vann).|$|E
