25|$|While the {{earthquake}} {{quickly became the}} only subject on talkback radio, other early coverage relied on comments from Police and other 24-hour services who were immediately affected and needed {{to communicate with the}} media. Because {{the earthquake}} occurred early <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>morning,</b> with only overnight staff on duty, it took several hours for some media outlets to give the event full live coverage. So it took until mid-morning for some media outlets to have sufficient stories and staff on duty to allow them to commence continuous live broadcasts. One television producer later observed that if the earthquake had happened just a few hours earlier, or later, they would have had a full studio crew on duty and have been able to go live immediately.|$|E

25|$|<b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>morning</b> in 1852 a {{town meeting}} decided to {{continue}} the railway down to the sea, to the harbour. The people at the meeting imagined Torquay as an industrial town, importing raw materials through the harbour and transporting finished articles inland. This decision caused great controversy, and in {{the afternoon of the}} same day another meeting was held cancelling the decision of the morning and deciding to continue the railway to the sea but not to the harbour. As a result, Torquay kept its character as a tourist town and became the place it is today. The new railway station was opened on 2 August 1859 with the line to Paignton, but remained a distance away from the town centre and harbourside, although ideally placed for Torre Abbey Sands.|$|E
