40|$|With {{the coming}} {{enlargement}} of the ED, and with the ongoing dispute over the national incidence of the ED-budget, budgetary discipline {{with respect to the}} general ED-budget will become of increasing importance. Budgetary discipline can be achieved by commitment to numerical targets, or by procedural strategic dominance of a party that is sympathetic to the efficient use of public resources (like a Minister of Finance on the national level). As for the ED-budget, at this moment a range of numerical targets is used, such as the VAT-call-up-rate and -ceiling, the <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> <b>ceiling,</b> and the agricultural guideline. As a result of Agenda 2000 these targets have been supplemented by rules concerning the structural policies, and regarding pre-accession and accession expenditure. In addition to these numerical rules, various procedural rules are used, mostly relating to the division of budgetary competence between Commission, Council, and Parliament, in stead of rules that institute strategic dominance of one of these parties. In this paper these rules as well as their application are critically assessed, focusing on the period 1977 - 1999. It is concluded that both Commission and Council have wrongfully stayed clear of introducing new procedural budgetary rules. Instead of that, they rely heavily on new numerical targets, that give cause to rigidity and creative budgeting...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} debated {{problems}} of the EU enlargement to the Central and Eastern European countries is the financing of the candidate countries. As they are much poorer and much more agricultural than the present EU members, they will be entitled to major financial transfers from the EU budget. Given the limited size of the EU budget, this will imply to redesign the current EU policies and financial transfers. The paper examines the framework (Agenda 2000 and the Berlin European Council) within which the present pre-accession and accession appropriations have been determined. Remarkable differences {{can be observed in}} the financial transfers to the current and future member States: however, given the Agenda 2000 accession hypothesis (first and second wave accessions), the estimated cost of eliminating this unequal treatment would be affordable under the current financial provisions. The recent change in the EU accession negotiation strategy opens the possibility that nearly all the candidate countries join the EU before 2006 : the additional financial burden could be sustained without changing the present <b>Own</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>ceiling,</b> provided a difference in treatment could be accepted between the EU incumbents and the new members. The paper finally presents the estimated costs of enlarging the EU to eight or ten new members, while granting them, under the current policy regime, a level of transfers comparable to what is granted to the poorer EU incumbents. budgetary costs of EU Eastern enlargement, EU financial perspectives 2000 - 2006. ...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, several {{synchronization}} protocols for {{resource sharing}} {{have been presented}} {{for use in a}} Hierarchical Scheduling Framework (HSF). An initial comparative assessment of existing protocols revealed that none of the protocols is superior to the others and that the performance of a protocol heavily depends on system parameters. In this paper, we aim at efficiency improvements of the synchronization protocol SIRAP [5] and its associated schedulability analysis, where efficiency refers to calculated CPU resource needs. The contribution of the paper is threefold. Firstly, we present an improvement of the schedulability analysis for SIRAP, which makes SIRAP more efficient. Secondly, we generalize SIRAP by distinguishing separate <b>resource</b> <b>ceilings</b> for self-blocking and resource access. Using a separate <b>resource</b> <b>ceiling</b> for self-blocking enables a reduction of the interference from lower priority tasks, which can result in efficiency improvements. The efficiency improvement depends on both subsystem characteristics and the value selected for the <b>resource</b> <b>ceiling</b> for self-blocking, however. The third contribution of this paper is therefore an algorithm that given a subsystem selects for each globally shared resource an optimal value in terms of efficiency for its <b>resource</b> <b>ceiling</b> for self-blocking. The efficiency improvement gained by the algorithm compared to the original SIRAP approach is evaluated by means of simulation...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} serious criticisms of the status quo with respect to the EU budget {{represents}} the lack of a link between the EU policy and the system of <b>own</b> <b>resources.</b> Strengthening the link between reaching smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and the EU system of <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> by introducing tax-based <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> could contribute to decrease the existing sustainability gaps in taxation in the European Union. This research demonstrates that the introduction of the Common (Consolidated) Corporate Tax Base (hereinafter as C(C) CTB) could be an important contribution to close the existing sustainability gaps in tax regimes in the EU. To research the revenue potential of the C(C) CTB, a model based on a remittance system was designed. The system foresees the replacement of the VAT-based <b>own</b> <b>resource</b> (resp. GNI-based <b>own</b> <b>resource)</b> through the transfer of a part of the corporate tax revenues based on the C(C) CTB raised on the national level to the EU budget. The results of the research show that the C(C) CTB-based <b>own</b> <b>resource</b> would be able to fully replace the VAT-based <b>own</b> <b>resource,</b> with the only exception of Cyprus. However, the C(C) CTB-based <b>own</b> <b>resource</b> cannot be considered to be a sufficient resource to fully replace the GNI-base <b>own</b> <b>resource.</b> Therefore, we recommend C(C) CTB only in connection with the replacement of the VAT-based <b>own</b> <b>resource.</b> FairTa...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} various flavors {{of the stack}} resource policy (SRP) for arbitrating access to shared resources in a hierarchical scheduling framework (HSF) upon a uni-processor. We propose algorithms for exploring and selecting the (local) <b>resource</b> <b>ceilings</b> within components, such that it results in an optimal composition of resource-sharing components in an HSF. Existing methods are non-optimal, because (i) they optimize just the length of global non-preemptive execution of tasks and (ii) they do not detect whether or not resources are shared globally (i. e., between tasks of different components). Lifting these limitations leads to an exponential growth of the design space. This paper contributes a fast three-step methodology which lifts these limitations, i. e., we apply the SRP at each level of the HSF to just the resources being shared. Our algorithm selects those component interfaces (i. e., by fixing the local <b>resource</b> <b>ceilings</b> of each component) that minimize the system load...|$|R

40|$|Although  the  responsibility  for  realizing  the  Europe   2020  strategy  is  shared  between the EU and its 28 member states, {{the main}} {{criticism}} of the current EU budget relates {{to the lack of}} a link between the budget and Europe 2020  strategy.  Therefore a new  budget design as well as alternative revenue sources is currently explored within a  mid-term review. One of the possible candidates is a Financial Transaction Tax (FTT). To research FTT revenue potential, a model based on  a remittance system was designed. We analyse full or partial replacement of VAT- and GNI-based <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> by the transfer of the tax revenues from a FTT raised on a national level to the EU budget. The research reveals that FTT-based <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> would be able to fully replace GNI-based <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> and VAT-based <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> only for some EU member states. However, the results also show that, from the EU 11 (28) perspective, the tax is sufficient to fully replace VAT- or GNI-contributions if levied on the EU 11 (28) level (not on the national level) as a direct payment to the EU budget without tracking the source Member State.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the EU financing reform, where the lump-sum tax is considered as an alternative source of revenue. The purpose of this study stems out of the current debate related to the EU budget reform, where tax-based own-resources are required to replace the current system of <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> of the EU budget. The novelty of this research arises from the evaluation of a hypothetical EU lump-sum tax as a future replacement of GNI and VAT-based EU budget own sources. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze the potential of a lump-sum tax as a source of future EU funding. We consider lump-sum tax as an EU per capita charge applicable to all citizens of 28 EU member states. In order to assess the lump-sum tax potential we simulate five different lump-sum tax rates and compare the obtained yield to current EU <b>own</b> <b>resources.</b> The results of the research show that a charge per capita in the EU does not have the capacity to fully replace GNI or VAT-based EU <b>own</b> <b>resources.</b> Therefore, we consider the EU per capita charge as a form of complementary source to fund the EU own budget, with no real potential to fully replace the current EU <b>own</b> <b>resources...</b>|$|R
