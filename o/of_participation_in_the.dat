5|$|After {{fallout from}} the {{unsuccessful}} Ogaden campaign of the late 1970s, the Barre administration began arresting government and military officials under suspicion <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> abortive 1978 coup d'état. Most {{of the people who}} had allegedly helped plot the putsch were summarily executed. However, several officials managed to escape abroad and started to form the first of various dissident groups dedicated to ousting Barre's regime by force.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman Conquest of England, Pantulf held {{lands in}} Shropshire from Earl Roger de Montgomery. The earl settled {{a number of}} his Norman vassals, {{including}} Pantulf, on his new lands in Sussex and Shropshire. Pantulf was probably not present at the Battle of Hastings, likely due to Earl Roger's lack <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> campaign of conquest. Pantulf's grants totalled eleven manors located in Hodnet Hundred. Pantulf's lands in England were centered on Wem, and are considered a feudal barony, making Pantulf the first Baron of Wem. Although he had substantial lands in England, Pantulf continued to spend most of his time on the continent.|$|E
5|$|Tech's {{fortunes}} declined dramatically {{following the}} victory over Miami. The {{week after that}} win, Tech lost 31–28 to Pittsburgh, then escaped with a one-point win in overtime against Temple University, which had just one win that season. Tech's win against Temple was its last in the regular season. The Hokies lost their final two regular-season games, dropping their overall record to 8–4. To some Virginia Tech fans, the Insight Bowl invitation accepted on December1 was a disappointment after a season that began with hopes <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> national championship game.|$|E

5|$|The {{shift in}} support by the Soviet Union {{motivated}} the Barre regime to seek allies elsewhere. It eventually settled on Russia's Cold War arch-rival, the United States, {{which had been}} courting the Somali government for some time. The U.S. eventually gave extensive military support. Following the disastrous Ogaden War, Barre's government began arresting government and military officials under suspicion <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> abortive 1978 coup d'état. Most {{of the people who}} had allegedly helped plot the putsch were summarily executed. However, several officials managed to escape abroad where they formed the Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF), the first of various dissident groups dedicated to ousting Barre's regime by force. Among these opposition movements were the Somali Patriotic Movement (SPM) and Somali Democratic Alliance (SDA), a Gadabuursi group which had been formed in the northwest to counter the Somali National Movement (SNM) Isaaq militia.|$|E

In January 2014, Batista returned to WWE after having left in May 2010, and promptly won the 2014 Royal Rumble match for a slot in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXX. Batista's win and Daniel Bryan's lack <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Royal Rumble match was heavily booed by the live crowd at the event. At Elimination Chamber, Randy Orton successfully defended his championship in the Elimination Chamber match to set up Orton versus Batista (who still received a negative fan reaction at Elimination Chamber when he defeated Alberto Del Rio) for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXX. Daniel Bryan also participated in the Elimination Chamber match, but was the last wrestler eliminated due to interference by Director of Operations Kane, who was affiliated with the Authority.|$|E

A study conducted by economist Aamer Abu-Qarn determined that the most significant barriers to women’s employment are lack of education, lack of experience, and poor infrastructure in Bedouin towns.

His parents were José Luís Mena Barreto and Ana Emília da Silveira Sampaio. José Luís belonged to a wealthy family of Portuguese descent and military background, who owned ranches and large cattle herds.

25|$|Due {{to lack of}} evidence, Zoran Stojanović was pardoned in 2007 and {{released}} from custody. In late 2009, President of Serbia Boris Tadić pardoned Zoran Stojanović, declaring that the trial was unjust, which opened {{the question as to}} whether he had jurisdiction because Stojanović was sentenced by an international High court. Stojanović's ethnic Albanian wife and their two children have been exposed to intensified intimidation, most notably because other Albanians consider her a traitor for marrying a Serb. As of 2011, no one has been found guilty <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Račak massacre and no known investigations are currently being held.|$|E

The Half-Way Covenant, adopted by the synods of 1657 and 1662, had made baptism alone the condition to the civil privileges of church membership, but not <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sacrament of the Lord's Supper. Edwards's grandfather and predecessor in the pastorate, Solomon Stoddard, had been even more liberal, holding that the Supper was a converting ordinance and that baptism was a sufficient title to all the privileges of the church.|$|E

25|$|Below {{the level}} of the 3. Liga, leagues are {{generally}} subdivided on a regional basis. For example, the Regionalligen are currently made up of Nord (North), Nordost (Northeast), Süd (South), Südwest (Southwest) and West divisions. Below this are thirteen parallel divisions, most of which are called Oberligen (upper leagues) which represent federal states or large urban and geographical areas. The levels below the Oberligen differ between the local areas. The league structure has changed frequently and typically reflects the degree <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sport {{in various parts of the}} country. In the early 1990s, changes were driven by the reunification of Germany and the subsequent integration of the national league of East Germany.|$|E
25|$|At {{that time}} Turkey had two {{competing}} governments in Constantinople and Ankara. The government in Constantinople supported the Turkish trials with {{more or less}} seriousness depending on the current government. While Grand Vizier Damat Ferid Pasha (4 March - 2 October 1919 and again 5 April - 21 October 1920) stood behind the prosecuting body, the government of Grand Vizier Ali Riza Pasha (2 October 1919 - 2 March 1920) barely made a mention of the legal proceedings against the war criminals. The trials had also blurred the crime <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Turkish National Movement with the crime of the Armenian Genocide, and ultimately resulted in increasing support for the government in Ankara that would be led later on by Atatürk.|$|E
