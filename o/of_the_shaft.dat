40|$|In this study, a {{parametric}} {{study is}} performed to investigate <b>the</b> squeal noise <b>of</b> an automobile water pump.

5|$|The humerus is very robust with {{strongly}} expanded {{upper and}} lower ends. Humerus specimen OUMNH J.13575 has a length of 388 millimetres.

40|$|Multiaxial fatigue {{failures}} of welded coupling flanges of stirrers in a fertilizer plant required an investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{reasons for the}} failures and <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> an improved design.

Emerging near Black Mesa's classification yards, Calhoun learns that Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues plan to escape the facility using teleportation technology. After freeing Rosenberg from the captivity of the US Marines detachment sent to silence the facility, Calhoun escorts him to a decommissioned prototype teleportation laboratory, where several Black Mesa employees have already gathered. Rosenberg then teleports Calhoun to the Xen border world to calibrate research equipment needed to pinpoint a teleport destination outside of Black Mesa. Upon his return, Rosenberg informs Calhoun that the teleporter's battery power has been exhausted, and contact has been lost with a team sent to acquire a new power cell.|$|E

5|$|With the {{inclined}} plane, {{the problems}} {{stemmed from a}} mis-calculation. Power was provided by a large tank, filled with water, which descended in a shaft, raising one boat on a trolley and allowing another to descend as it did so. When the tank reached the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft,</b> the water discharged, and the second tank was used to reverse the process. Green had been the engineer on the Bude Canal, where this design had been used successfully, but {{the size of the}} tanks at Wellisford were much too small. On the Bude Canal, a tank holding 15tons of water was required to raise a boat weighing six tons. The Grand Western Canal used boats holding eight tons, but the tanks only held ten tons of water, whereas tests indicated that about 25tons was needed. It was for this reason that the steam engine was obtained to supply the power.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{unbalanced}} {{magnetic pull}} (UMP) of hydro turbine generating sets (HTGS) is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main reason induced vibration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HTGS {{and the power}} plant.

5|$|According to Novas (1993), Herrerasaurus can be {{distinguished}} based on the following features: {{the presence of a}} premaxilla-maxilla fenestra, and the dorsal part of laterotemporal fenestra is less than a third as wide as the ventral part; the presence of a ridge on the lateral surface of the jugal bone, and a deeply incised supratemporal fossa that extends across the medial postorbital process; the subquadrate ventral squamosal process has a lateral depression, and the quadratojugal bone overlaps the posterodorsal quadrate face; the pterygoid process of the quadrate has an inturned, trough-shaped ventral margin, and the presence of a slender ribbed posterodorsal dentary process; the surangular bone has a forked anterior process for articulation with the posterodorsal dentary process; the humerus' internal tuberosity is proximally projected and separated from the humeral head by a deep groove (also present in coelophysoids); possesses enlarged hands, which are 60% {{of the size of the}} humerus+radius, and the humeral entepicondyle is ridge-like with anterior and posterior depressions; and the posterior border of the ilial peduncle forms a right angle with the dorsal border <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> on the ischium.|$|E
5|$|The innominate {{is known}} from seven examples, {{but most are}} quite incomplete. It {{includes}} a narrow ilium and long ischium. The ischial tuberosity, a narrow rough piece of bone in most placentals, is broad and smooth in Plesiorycteropus. With 17 specimens, the femur is the best represented long bone. It is distinctive in its long neck, similar only to the gymnure Echinosorex according to MacPhee. A projection known as the third trochanter is larger in P.madagascariensis. The tibia and fibula are extensively fused into a tibiofibula, of which eight examples are known. This bone resembles that of armadillos in the extensive fusion, the compression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> of the tibia, the narrowness of the articulation surface at the distal end, and the broad space between the bones. Unlike in armadillos, the tibia and fibula are not inclined relative to each other, but about parallel. The astragalus, which is known from four examples, is wide and short and contains a uniquely large posteromedial process. Seven metapodials (middle hand or foot bones) are known, rather variable in size, but MacPhee was unable to separate metacarpals (from the hand) and metatarsals (from the foot). All are rather short and are broad proximally and narrow distally. Among the few known phalanges, the proximal phalange is shorter than the middle one and the distal phalanges are narrow and clawlike.|$|E
5|$|The thighbone is {{straight}} in front view. Seen {{from the same}} direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft, seen from above it is orientated 20° to the front. The greater trochanter is relatively wide and separated from the robust lesser trochanter in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the lesser trochanter a low accessory trochanter is present. At {{the lower end of}} the thighbone a distinct front, extensor, groove separates the condyles. At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The shinbone, or tibia, is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively flattens from front to rear, resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about an eighth of its length the front lower end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> is covered by a vertical branch of the astragalus. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth metatarsals are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three weight-bearing toes. They are straight and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more flexible joint, allowing for a modicum of horizontal movement. The top inner side of the third metatarsal carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second metatarsal, causing a tighter connection.|$|E

40|$|Additive manufacturing, more {{specifically}} 3 D printing using fused filament fabrication (FFF), {{is a valuable}} technique; however, little {{has been done in}} developing a new mechanism for driving filament through <b>the</b> hot end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 3 D printer. This investigation focuses on a prototype extruder mechanism that utilizes two counter rotating motors to force filament through the nozzle. The plastic passes through <b>the</b> armateurs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two motors and <b>the</b> oppositely-threaded <b>shafts</b> drive <b>the</b> filament while balancing each others torque. This design provides better protection against jamming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nozzle. A bench top prototype was able to extrude filament at a rate much greater than traditional mechanisms allow, but the threads on <b>the</b> aluminum <b>shafts</b> wore down with very little use. An abrasive wear model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extruder <b>shafts</b> was developed in order to determine <b>the</b> theoretical lifetime <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> given a certain material hardness. <b>The</b> wear rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> is proportional to <b>the</b> hardness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material and <b>the</b> square <b>of</b> <b>the</b> velocity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extruded filament. Based on this model as well as experiments done with various materials, it is estimated that steel shafts will have a lifetime that is 3 to 10 times longer than aluminum shafts. Still, this lifetime is still far too short for a part meant to be used 24 / 7. The wear on <b>the</b> threads <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> is so severe that no feasible material could survive an adequate lifetime before failure. by Joseph Sandoval. Thesis: S.

40|$|Braided sleeve {{composite}} shafts {{are produced}} and their torsional behavior is investigated. The braided sleeves are slid over an Al tube to create {{very strong and}} rigid tubular form shafts {{and they are in}} <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> 2 / 2 twill biaxial fiber fabric that has been woven into a continuous sleeve.

25|$|In {{the eastern}} United States, the shafts of {{mattocks}} are often {{fitted with a}} screw below the head and parallel with it to secure the head from slipping down the shaft, but in the western United States, where tools are more commonly dismantled for transport, this is rarely done.
