5|$|Despite closer {{co-operation}} {{and improvements}} {{made to the}} Bakerloo stations and {{to other parts of}} the network, the Underground railways continued to struggle financially. The UERL's ownership of the highly profitable London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the UERL group, through the pooling of revenue, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways. However, competition from numerous small bus companies during the early 1920s eroded the profitability of the LGOC and had a negative impact on the profitability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> UERL group.|$|E
