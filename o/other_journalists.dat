5|$|According to {{journalist}} , Enderlin's {{coverage of}} the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was respected by <b>other</b> <b>journalists</b> but was regularly criticized by pro-Israel groups. As {{a result of the}} al-Durrah case, he received death threats, his wife was assaulted in the street, his children were threatened, the family had to move home, and at one point they considered emigrating to the United States.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} San Luis Potosí, Blancornelas {{began his career}} as a {{journalist}} for El Sol de San Luis in April 1955, working as a sportswriter. In 1960, he moved to Tijuana, Baja California, where he became active in reporting on corruption and the drug trade. He was promoted to news editor at the daily newspaper El Mexicano before moving to the daily La Voz de la Frontera, of which he became editor-in-chief. Unlike several <b>other</b> <b>journalists</b> during his time, Blancornelas was eager to write about drug trafficking and corruption, leading to his firing from three newspapers before deciding to create his own.|$|E
5|$|Enderlin {{responded to}} Leconte and Jeambar in January 2005 in Le Figaro. He thanked them for rejecting that the scene had been staged. He had {{reported}} that the shots were fired by the Israelis because, he wrote, he trusted the cameraman, {{who had worked for}} France 2 since 1988. In the days following the shooting, other witnesses, including <b>other</b> <b>journalists,</b> offered some confirmation, he said. He added that the Israeli army had not responded to France 2's offers to cooperate with their investigation.|$|E

5|$|In 1948, De Mauro {{moved to}} Palermo in Sicily under an assumed name, {{and worked for}} local {{newspapers}} such as Il Tempo di Sicilia, and Il Mattino di Sicilia. In 1959 he started working for L'Ora, a Communist-oriented paper. <b>Other</b> <b>journalists</b> were puzzled about De Mauro's presence at the newspaper: {{he had been a}} supporter of Mussolini until the bitter end and fought in the brutal war against the anti-Fascist partisans. Rumour had it that his nose had been broken by partisans.|$|E
5|$|Jackie's account {{generated}} much media attention, and UVA {{suspended the}} fraternity. After <b>other</b> <b>journalists</b> investigated the article's claims and found significant discrepancies, Rolling Stone issued multiple apologies for the story. Further investigation concluded that Jackie had fabricated the incident. According to multiple media, Jackie may have invented the gang rape story in an unsuccessful attempt {{to win the}} affections of a fellow student {{that she had a}} romantic interest in; other sources suggested that PTSD might be a factor in Jackie's creation of the story. Later, Jackie herself said that she believed her story at the time.|$|E
5|$|On April 20, 2011, it was {{reported}} that customers had launched a protest against perceived shortcomings of Portal 2. Users complained that the game was too shortsome saying that it is only four hours long, about the existence of paid, downloadable content for some versions at launch, and that the Windows and OS X versions were ports of the console version. <b>Other</b> <b>journalists</b> countered that the quality of the graphics on the Windows and Mac versions did not suggest a simple console port. Stephen Totilo of Kotaku wrote that the game lasted nine hours and that the downloadable content consisted purely of cosmetic add-ons. Some journalists said that the minimal impact of The Potato Sack alternative reality game on the early release of Portal 2 may be influencing the user scores.|$|E

5|$|While still a cricketer, Fender {{wrote for}} several London {{newspapers}} and magazines, and also broadcast on the radio. Although remaining in England, he {{commented on the}} 1924–25 Ashes series for the Sunday Express and became involved in an argument which arose during the tour over the merits of professional captaincy; Fender believed professionals would make good captains. He also wrote about the 1926 series, and drew criticism from Australians when he called their sportsmanship into question. He later wrote regularly for the Evening News and The Star; to the irritation of <b>other</b> <b>journalists,</b> {{he became the first}} man to use a typewriter in the press box.|$|E
5|$|In the December 11, 1892 Sunday paper, Dunne wrote another dialect column, {{this time}} {{set in the}} upscale Dearborn Street saloon of Colonel Malachi McNeary (in all columns but the first spelled McNeery). That barkeeper was based on James McGarry, owner of a saloon near Chicago's {{newspaper}} district; Dunne and <b>other</b> <b>journalists</b> would drink there and write their stories. Beginning in the second McNeery column, the listener for his monologues is Johnny McKenna, a real-life figure, who was a Republican in a mostly Democratic Irish community, and who often received government jobs as a token of bipartisanship. The World's Columbian Exposition was the major event of 1893 in Chicago, and McNeery {{was used as a}} mouthpiece for Dunne's commentary on the events and sights of the fair. For example, McNeery views a meeting of the fair's Board of Lady Managers, chaired by Bertha Palmer, who in the column proves incapable of stopping an argument between the members.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately decided {{under the}} title O'Grady v. Superior Court, the suit filed by Apple against unnamed bloggers raised the issue {{for the first time}} of whether bloggers hold the same protections against {{revealing}} sources that journalists have. In November 2004, three popular weblog sites featuring Apple rumors publicly revealed information about two unreleased Apple products, the Mac mini and an as yet unreleased product code-named Asteroid, also known as Project Q97. Apple subpoenaed three sites to force them to identify their confidential sources: Apple Insider, Power Page, and, separately, Think Secret, which did no original reporting on the case and thus had no sources to reveal. In February 2005, a trial court in California decided that website operators {{do not have the same}} shield law protection as do <b>other</b> <b>journalists.</b> The journalists appealed and, in May 2006, the California Court of Appeal reversed the trial court's decision, ruling that activities in question were covered by the shield law.|$|E

To be member of the Journalistic Collective (Verband der Journalisten der DDR, VDJ) provided advantages to the members, and made it possible to achieve better positions.

25|$|Milner has {{the ability}} to pass {{accurately}} and shoot from a great distance from goal. As a result, he usually goes forward for set pieces and is often a candidate to take corners and free kicks. Critical opinion is divided as to Milner's crossing ability.

25|$|The channel {{has also}} {{come in for}} {{criticism}} from several corners, {{the most prominent of}} which are some of the BBC's long-standing presenters.
