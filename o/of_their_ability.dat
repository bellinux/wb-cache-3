5|$|Character {{development}} is a primary element of Oblivion. At {{the beginning of the}} game, players select one of many human or anthropomorphic races, each of which has different natural abilities, and customize their character's appearance. A perpetual objective for players is to improve their character's skills, which are numerical representations <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> in certain areas.|$|E

As such they are models for Batesian mimicry by non-stinging insects such as bee-flies, robber flies and hoverflies, all of which gain a measure of protection by superficially looking and behaving like bees.|$|E

In contrast, a priestess-type companion might support the player character by casting beneficial spells, while a paladin-type would give support by attacking the player character's target, and then healing the protagonist after the battle or if he or she came close to dying.|$|E
5|$|Jamie Pearson was {{responsible}} for editing the episode. The sequence where Lucas rescues Harry and Ruth near the end were made in slow motion, because the producers felt it would add to the tension. The incidental music was composed by Paul Leonard-Morgan. The computer graphics on the episode were designed by Mark Doman. The producers ended up being receptive of both Morgan and Doman's work, because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to help interpret the story via the music, and computers, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Today, shetland sheep {{are mainly}} {{kept in the}} Shetland isles {{and a handful of}} other locales. This is because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to survive on {{infertile}} land that would otherwise be agriculturally useless. Their good-natured temperament is also a major attraction in keeping Shetland sheep. They are most commonly farmed for their prized wool, but they also may be kept for their meat.|$|E

5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> {{to quickly}} grow and the {{relative}} ease with which they can be manipulated, bacteria are the workhorses for the fields of molecular biology, genetics and biochemistry. By making mutations in bacterial DNA and examining the resulting phenotypes, scientists can determine the function of genes, enzymes and metabolic pathways in bacteria, then apply this knowledge to more complex organisms. This aim of understanding the biochemistry of a cell reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of enzyme kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. This is achievable in some well-studied bacteria, with models of Escherichia coli metabolism now being produced and tested. This understanding of bacterial metabolism and genetics allows the use of biotechnology to bioengineer bacteria {{for the production of}} therapeutic proteins, such as insulin, growth factors, or antibodies.|$|E
5|$|By 1913, Large Black had by {{then spread}} {{throughout}} most of Britain, and had been exported to most of mainland Europe and to North and South America, Africa and Oceania. The first exports to Australia were in 1902 or 1903, with the Large Black being chosen over the Berkshire pig because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to thrive in hot weather, their foraging abilities and their fecundity. By 1930, Large Blacks represented only 1 percent of Australia pig population, and were raised mainly by breeders in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. The breed population continued to hover around 1 {{percent of the total}} population, with a slight increase after World War II and a decrease to almost zero new registrations in the 1980s. The first exports to the US were in the 1920s, but the population in that country dwindled to the point where imports were again necessary in 1985. Today, small herds {{can be found in the}} US that descend from the pigs imported in 1985 and 1990, and there are also herds in Canada, Australia, and South Africa.|$|E
5|$|For {{almost all}} of their history, Serjeants at Law and King's Serjeants were the only advocates given rights of {{audience}} in the Court of Common Pleas. Until the 17th century they were also first {{in the order of}} precedence in the Court of King's Bench and Court of Chancery, which gave them priority in motions before the court. Serjeants also had the privilege of being immune from most normal forms of lawsuit â€“ they could only be sued by a writ from the Court of Chancery. It was held as an extension of this that servants of Serjeants could only be sued in the Common Pleas. As part of the Court of Common Pleas the Serjeants also performed some judicial duties, such as levying fines. In exchange for these privileges, Serjeants were expected to fulfil certain duties; firstly, that they represent anybody who asked regardless <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to pay, and secondly that, due to the small number of judges, they serve as deputy judges to hear cases when there was no judge available.|$|E

5|$|Limousins {{have become}} popular {{because of their}} low birth weights (ease of calving), higher than average {{dressing}} percentage (ratio of carcase to live weight) and yield (ratio of meat to carcase), high feed conversion efficiency, {{and their ability to}} produce lean, tender meat. A major multi-breed study reported that Limousins converted feed into saleable meat more efficiently and significantly faster than popular British breeds, and marginally faster than other popular continental European cattle breeds. Conversely, the other cattle breeds produced proportionally more low-cost by-product and waste, which resulted in their live weight growth being faster than Limousins. Limousins are especially favoured for crossbreeding with cattle such as Angus, Hereford and Shorthorn because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to contribute hybrid vigour, and improve the yield and feed conversion efficiency of these British breeds, which produce higher levels of fat and marbled meat.|$|E
5|$|Male {{grasshoppers}} {{spend much}} of the day stridulating, singing more actively under optimal conditions and being more subdued when conditions are adverse; females also stridulate, but their efforts are insignificant when compared to the males. Late-stage male nymphs can sometimes be seen making stridulatory movements, although they lack the equipment to make sounds, demonstrating the importance of this behavioural trait. The songs are a means of communication; the male stridulation seems to express reproductive maturity, the desire for social cohesion and individual well-being. Social cohesion becomes necessary among grasshoppers because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to jump or fly large distances, and the song can serve to limit dispersal and guide others to favourable habitat. The generalised song can vary in phraseology and intensity, and is modified {{in the presence of a}} rival male, and changes again to a courtship song when a female is nearby. In male grasshoppers of the family Pneumoridae, the enlarged abdomen amplifies stridulation.|$|E
5|$|Settlement on the Mendip Hills {{appears to}} fall into two types. The first, {{apparent}} in the Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain periods, and repeated {{on a small scale}} in the Middle Ages and post-medieval era, comprised occupation by self-sufficient groups in small communities or isolated farms. The second was represented in the Iron Age Britain and Roman periods by large sites with specialist functions, existing by virtue <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to exert power over lowland producers. From the Iron Age onward the ownership of land took on increasing importance, with large landholdings based on the mines or on stock grazing, denying settlers access to the plateau or forcing them off the hills.|$|E

5|$|The British {{engineering}} firm Atelier One and freelance engineer Chris Hornzee-Jones (who later {{went on to}} form the {{engineering firm}} Aerotrope in 2005) provided the sculpture's structural design, and Performance Structures, Inc. (PSI) was chosen to fabricate it because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to produce nearly invisible welds. The project began with PSI attempting to recreate the design in miniature. A high-density polyurethane foam model was selected by Kapoor, which was then used to design the final structure, including the interior structural components. Initially, PSI planned to build and assemble the sculpture in Oakland, California, and ship it to Chicago through the Panama Canal and St. Lawrence Seaway. However, this plan was discarded after park officials deemed it too risky, so {{the decision was made}} to transport the individual panels by truck and to assemble the structure on-site, a task undertaken by MTH Industries.|$|E
5|$|While {{studying}} naturally fluorescing minerals in 1896, the French physicist Henri Becquerel {{discovered that}} they emitted radiation without any exposure to an external energy source. These radioactive materials {{became the subject of}} much interest by scientists, including the New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford who discovered they emitted particles. He designated these particles alpha and beta, on the basis <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to penetrate matter. In 1900, Becquerel showed that the beta rays emitted by radium could be deflected by an electric field, and that their mass-to-charge ratio was the same as for cathode rays. This evidence strengthened the view that electrons existed as components of atoms.|$|E
5|$|Yichang was keen for {{his eldest}} son to gain a basic {{education}} rooted in Confucianism, the dominant moral ideology of Chinese society; he deemed a knowledge of Confucian teaching to be essential in allowing his son to develop key business and administrative skills. His hope was that Zedong would gain an apprenticeship with a Xiangtan rice merchant before taking over the family business and supporting his parents during their old age. Yichang was particularly adamant {{on the need to}} learn about Confucianism after losing a lawsuit over a parcel of land; he believed that his opponent had been victorious in the dispute as a result <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to quote the sayings of ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius throughout their argument.|$|E

5|$|Agriculture {{remained}} by far {{the most}} important part of the English economy during the 12thand 13th centuries. There remained a wide variety in English agriculture, influenced by local geography; in areas where grain could not be grown, other resources were exploited instead. In the Weald, for example, agriculture centred on grazing animals on the woodland pastures, whilst in the Fens fishing and bird-hunting was supplemented by basket-making and peat-cutting. In some locations, such as Lincolnshire and Droitwich, salt manufacture was important, including production for the export market. Fishing became an important trade along the English coast, especially in Great Yarmouth and Scarborough, and the herring was a particularly popular catch; salted at the coast, it could then be shipped inland or exported to Europe. Piracy between competing English fishing fleets was not unknown during the period. Sheep were the most common farm animal in England during the period, their numbers doubling by the 14th century. Sheep became increasingly widely used for wool, particularly in the Welsh borders, Lincolnshire and the Pennines. Pigs remained popular on holdings because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to scavenge for food. Oxen remained the primary plough animal, with horses used more widely on farms in the south of England towards the end of the 12th century. Rabbits were introduced from France in the 13th century and farmed for their meat in special warrens.|$|E
5|$|Doubtful <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> {{to capture}} the redoubt alone, at 13:15 Meldrum asked for reinforcements; he was {{informed}} {{there were no more}} available. The Canterbury Mounted Rifles, advanced into a gap between the Wellingtons and the 5th Mounted Brigade, which eased the pressure. By 15:00 the superior Turkish numbers and their strong defences, forced Meldrum to commit his reserve, the 2nd Squadron and a section of the Machine-Gun Squadron. At the same time, the horses were moved further to the rear so that they would be out of artillery range. At 15:15 the regiment's right was counter-attacked by three or four hundred Turkish troops. Fifteen minutes later Meldrum again asked for reinforcements; he was again refused. Supported by their artillery, the regiment held out until 17:00, when the Turks retired, having suffered heavy losses. An hour later the regiment was ordered to withdraw at nightfall. The 2nd Squadron reported that they had gained a position which allowed them to assault the redoubt. Meldrum, aware that the redoubt would have to be abandoned even if they were successful, refused to allow the assault. At 18:30 the Royal Horse Artillery withdrew. Then, confusingly, the regiment was ordered to remain where they were, until the yeomanry to their left had moved back. So it was not until 20:15 that the regiment left the front line. At 01:00 20 April the regiment reached the night camp at El Jemme. Their casualties during the battle amounted to one dead and twenty-three wounded. The same night, this second attempt to capture Gaza was called off.|$|E
