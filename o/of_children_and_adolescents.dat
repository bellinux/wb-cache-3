40|$|Objective: The {{national}} shortage <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrists {{has prompted}} {{efforts to improve}} recruitment. It is uncertain whether these efforts will be sufficient to address this shortage {{and its impact on}} youth mental health services. Method: Data were compared from 1990 to 2001 by state, county characteristics, number of youths, and percentage of youths living in poverty to determine any changes in the number <b>and</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrists. Trends in the number of residents <b>and</b> age distribution <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrists were also analyzed. Results: The number <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrists has increased, but it still falls below estimates projected to adequately serve youth mental health needs. Disparities in <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrist distribution persist, with significantly fewer in rural counties or counties with a high percentage <b>of</b> <b>children</b> living in poverty. The age <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrists has shifted, with fewer below age 35. The number of residents in training has not changed significantly since 1995. Conclusions: The shortage <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrists remains <b>and</b> is still accentuated for those living in rural areas or in poverty. Despite the increased number <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrists, the number of residents and changes in workforce age indicate that the shortage will continue. J. Am.

25|$|Posttraumatic stress {{reactions}} {{have not}} been studied as well {{in children and adolescents}} as adults. The rate of PTSD may be lower in children than adults, but in the absence of therapy, symptoms may continue for decades. One estimate suggests that the proportion <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> having PTSD in a non-wartorn population in a developed country may be 1% compared to 1.5% to 3% of adults, and much lower below the age of 10 years. On average, 16% of children exposed to a traumatic event develop PTSD, varying according to type of exposure and gender.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} that a helmet fit the cyclist properly – in one study <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> aged 4 to 18 years, 96% {{were found to be}} incorrectly fitted. Efficacy of incorrectly fitted helmets is reckoned to be much lower; one estimate states that risk is increased almost twofold. The Snell Memorial Foundation recommends that any helmet that has sustained a substantial blow should be discarded and replaced, including any helmet involved in a crash in which the head has hit a hard surface or in which a fall has resulted in marks on the shell. Because some helmet materials deteriorate with age, the Snell Memorial Foundation recommends that a helmet be replaced at least every 5 years, or sooner if the manufacturer recommends it.|$|E
25|$|In Brazil, {{the minimum}} working age has been {{identified}} as fourteen due to continuous constitutional amendments that occurred in 1934, 1937, and 1946. Yet due to a change in the dictatorship by the military in the 80’s, the minimum age restriction was reduced to the age of twelve but was reviewed due to reports of dangerous and hazardous working conditions in 1988. This led to the minimum age being raised once again to 14. Another set of restrictions was passed in 1998 that restricted the kinds of work youth could partake in, such as work that was considered hazardous like running construction equipment, or certain kinds of factory work. Although many steps were taken to reduce the risk and occurrence of child labour, there is still a high number <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> working under the age of fourteen in Brazil. It was not until recently in the 80’s that it was discovered that almost nine million children in Brazil were working illegally and not partaking in traditional childhood activities that help to develop important life experiences.|$|E
