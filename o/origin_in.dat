40|$|Abstract Background While {{multiple}} replication origins {{have been}} observed in archaea, considerably less is known about their evolutionary processes. Here, we performed a comparative analysis of the predicted (proved in part) orc/cdc 6 -associated replication <b>origins</b> <b>in</b> 15 completely sequenced haloarchaeal genomes to investigate the diversity and evolution of replication <b>origins</b> <b>in</b> halophilic Archaea. Results Multiple orc/cdc 6 -associated replication <b>origins</b> were predicted <b>in</b> all of the analyzed haloarchaeal genomes following the identification of putative ORBs (origin recognition boxes) {{that are associated with}} orc/cdc 6 genes. Five of these predicted replication <b>origins</b> <b>in</b> Haloarcula hispanica were experimentally confirmed via autonomous replication activities. Strikingly, several predicted replication <b>origins</b> <b>in</b> H. hispanica and Haloarcula marismortui are located in the distinct regions of their highly homologous chromosomes, suggesting that these replication origins might have been introduced as parts of new genomic content. A comparison of the origin-associated Orc/Cdc 6 homologs and the corresponding predicted ORB elements revealed that the replication <b>origins</b> <b>in</b> a given haloarchaeon are quite diverse, while different haloarchaea can share a few conserved origins. Phylogenetic and genomic context analyses suggested that there is an original replication origin (oriC 1) that was inherited from the ancestor of archaea, and several other origins were likely evolved and/or translocated within the haloarchaeal species. Conclusion This study provides detailed information about the diversity of multiple orc/cdc 6 -associated replication <b>origins</b> <b>in</b> haloarchaeal genomes, and provides novel insight into the evolution of multiple replication <b>origins</b> <b>in</b> Archaea. </p...|$|R

5|$|Born 22 September 1905 into {{a family}} of Finnish <b>origin</b> <b>in</b> Oslo (then named Kristiania), he was baptized Håkon Steen Lie. He would later change the {{spelling}} to Haakon during World War II. His father was fireman Andreas Lie (1870-1942) {{and his mother was}} homemaker Karen Halvorsdatter Gunderud (1871-1952). Though he describes his childhood as a happy one, his family was poor and, until 1916, his father had to work 120 hours a week. With his parents, two brothers, and two sisters, he grew up at his fathers fire-station sharing one room and a kitchen in the St. Hanshaugen neighborhood. Lie got involved with the labour movement at the age of sixteen, in 1921.|$|E

5|$|Both written {{history and}} {{molecular}} genetic {{studies indicate that}} the domestic carrot has a single <b>origin</b> <b>in</b> Central Asia. Its wild ancestors probably originated in Persia (regions of which are now Iran and Afghanistan), which remains the centre of diversity for the wild carrot Daucus carota. A naturally occurring subspecies of the wild carrot was presumably bred selectively over the centuries to reduce bitterness, increase sweetness and minimise the woody core; this process produced the familiar garden vegetable.|$|E
5|$|Crocus cartwrightianus is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the family Iridaceae, native to Greece and Crete.

Saffron is the triploid form of a species found in Eastern Greece, Crocus cartwrightianus; it probably appeared first in Crete. An <b>origin</b> <b>in</b> Western or Central Asia, although often suspected, has been disproved by botanical research.|$|E
5|$|Dungeon Keeper {{took over}} two years to develop, and an {{expansion}} pack, a Direct3D version, and a level editor were released. Midway through development, Molyneux decided to leave Bullfrog when the game was complete, which was the motivation for its success. Versions for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation were in development, but cancelled. The game received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the uniqueness and depth. Dungeon Keeper was re-released on gog.com in 2011, and on <b>Origin</b> <b>in</b> 2016. A fan-made mod, KeeperFX, was released, which fixes bugs and adds features. Dungeon Keeper {{was followed by a}} sequel, Dungeon Keeper 2, in 1999, and influenced games such as Lego Rock Raiders and Ghost Master.|$|E

5|$|Hume has {{suggested}} that the Mascarene parrots have a common <b>origin</b> <b>in</b> the radiation of the Psittaculini tribe, basing this theory on morphological features and the fact that Psittacula parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean. The Psittaculini may have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Haifa al 'Atiqa was {{repopulated}} with many Arab Christians in an overall neighborhood {{in which many}} Middle Eastern Jews were established inhabitants, as Haifa expanded outward from its new location. The ultimate origin of the name Haifa remains unclear. One theory holds it derives from {{the name of the}} high priest Caiaphas. Some Christians believe it was named for Saint Peter, whose Aramaic name was Keiphah. Another theory holds it could be derived from the Hebrew verb root חפה (hafa), meaning to cover or shield, i.e. Mount Carmel covers Haifa; others point to a possible <b>origin</b> <b>in</b> the Hebrew word חוֹף (hof), meaning shore, or חוֹף יָפֶה (hof yafe), meaning beautiful shore.|$|E
5|$|Linguistically, {{the text}} of Rawlinson B 512 is similar to Harley 5280, {{especially}} at the beginning; {{and there are also}} innovations in common with the Book of Leinster, showing that the redactor clearly had more than one manuscript at his disposal.
