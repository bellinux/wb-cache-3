5|$|By {{the time}} Grace celebrated his 30th {{birthday}} in July 1878, he was {{arguably the most}} famous man in England; {{but he was also}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>controversial</b> on account of his gamesmanship and moneymaking. Both of these aspects were subject to serious challenge in the light of events in 1878.|$|E
5|$|Abortion activist Henry Morgentaler's {{appointment}} to the order on 1 July 2008 not only {{marked the first time}} the Advisory Council had not been unanimous in its decision, but also proved to be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>controversial</b> appointments in the order's history, drawing both praise from abortion rights groups and the ire of Members of Parliament, groups opposing abortion, and religious leaders. The latter organized protests outside of Rideau Hall on 9 July, while compatriots did the same in front of Government House in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, the official residence of that province's lieutenant governor.|$|E

5|$|As an {{independent}} production, it {{was picked up}} for distribution by Peace Arch Entertainment and premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival where it received polarized reactions from critics. It later went into limited theatrical release in the United States on March 28, 2008. Chapter 27 was cited as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>controversial</b> films of 2007. It won the Debut Feature Prize for Schaefer at the Zurich Film Festival, where Leto also received the Best Performance award for his portrayal of Chapman.|$|E
5|$|Breyer has {{consistently}} {{voted in favor}} of abortion rights, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>controversial</b> areas of the Supreme Court's docket. He has also defended the Supreme Court's use of foreign law and international law as persuasive (but not binding) authority in its decisions. However, Breyer is also recognized to be deferential to the interests of law enforcement and to legislative judgments in the Supreme Court's First Amendment rulings. Breyer has also demonstrated a consistent pattern of deference to Congress, voting to overturn congressional legislation at a lower rate than any other Supreme Court justice since 1994.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>controversial</b> {{aspects of}} Landis's commissionership is the {{question}} of race. From 1884, black ballplayers were informally banned from organized baseball. No black ballplayer played in organized baseball during Landis's commissionership; Rickey (then running the Brooklyn Dodgers) broke the color line by signing Jackie Robinson to play for the minor league Montreal Royals in 1946, after Landis's death; Robinson became the first black in the major leagues since the 19th century, playing with the Dodgers beginning in 1947.|$|E

5|$|The 2005 United States Grand Prix was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>controversial</b> Formula One motor {{races in}} modern history. It {{was held on}} June 19, 2005 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and was the ninth race of the 2005 FIA Formula One World Championship. Out of the 20 cars that entered the race, only the six cars from the teams using Bridgestone tyres (Ferrari, Jordan and Minardi) competed. The {{remaining}} fourteen entrants, all using Michelin tyres, completed the parade lap (thus having technically taken part in the race, avoiding punishment), but retired to the pits before the race started.|$|E
5|$|While Aronofsky's {{other movies}} have evoked {{significant}} emotional response, {{they were still}} far from the turmoil aroused by Noah. It was screened {{for the first time}} on March 28, 2014, and despite its PG-13 rating, it has quickly been recognized by Box Office Mojo as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>controversial</b> movies of the last 35 years along with such titles as The Passion of the Christ or The Da Vinci Code. Noah has been banned in United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Indonesia on religious grounds with other countries following suit.|$|E
5|$|Beauregard's {{decision}} was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>controversial</b> of the Civil War. Numerous veterans and historians have wondered {{what might have}} happened if the assault had gone forward into the night. Beauregard believed that the battle was essentially won and his men could finish off Grant in the morning. He knew the terrain to be crossed (a steep ravine containing a creek named Dill Branch) was extremely difficult and Grant's defensive line was heavy with massed artillery and supported by gunboats in the river. Unbeknownst to Beauregard, Buell's Army of the Ohio began arriving that afternoon, and he and Grant launched a massive counterattack on April 7. Overwhelmed, the Confederates retreated to Corinth.|$|E

5|$|Studio {{executives}} did {{not like}} the film and restructured Fincher's intended marketing campaign to try to reduce anticipated losses. Fight Club failed to meet the studio's expectations at the box office and initially received polarizing reactions from critics, becoming <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>controversial</b> and talked-about films of the year. Critics praised the acting, directing, themes and messages but debated the explicit violence and moral ambiguity. Over time, however, reception towards the film has become largely positive with critics and audiences, finding critical and commercial success with its DVD release, which established Fight Club as a cult film. It is now regarded by many {{as one of the greatest}} films of the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Teller {{was one of}} {{the strongest}} and best-known advocates for {{investigating}} non-military uses of nuclear explosives, which the United States explored under Operation Plowshare. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>controversial</b> projects he proposed was a plan to use a multi-megaton hydrogen bomb to dig a deep-water harbor more than a mile long and half a mile wide to use for shipment of resources from coal and oil fields through Point Hope, Alaska. The Atomic Energy Commission accepted Teller's proposal in 1958 and it was designated Project Chariot. While the AEC was scouting out the Alaskan site, and having withdrawn the land from the public domain, Teller publicly advocated the economic benefits of the plan, but was unable to convince local government leaders that the plan was financially viable.|$|E
5|$|The Shooting Star was a {{commercial}} success and {{was published in}} book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion; the first Tintin volume to be originally published in the 62-page full-colour format. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with The Secret of the Unicorn, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The Shooting Star has received a mixed critical reception and has been <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>controversial</b> instalments in the series due to the anti-Semitic portrayal of its villain. The story was adapted for both the 1957 Belvision animated series, Hergé's Adventures of Tintin, and for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|E

5|$|During {{the months}} leading up to the battle, Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston had {{repeatedly}} retreated from Sherman's superior force. All along the Western and Atlantic Railroad line, from Chattanooga, Tennessee, to Marietta, Georgia, a pattern was played and replayed: Johnston took up a defensive position, Sherman marched to outflank the Confederate defenses, and Johnston retreated again. After Johnston's withdrawal following the Battle of Resaca, the two armies clashed again at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, but the Confederate senior leadership in Richmond was unhappy with Johnston's perceived reluctance to fight the Union army, even though he had little chance of winning. Thus, on July 17, 1864, as he was preparing for the Battle of Peachtree Creek, Johnston was relieved of his command and replaced by Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood. The dismissal and replacement of Johnston remains <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>controversial</b> decisions of the civil war. Hood, who was fond of taking risks, lashed out at Sherman's army at Peachtree Creek, but the attack failed with more than two thousand five hundred Confederate casualties.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>controversial</b> {{measures}} Daniels successfully {{pushed through}} {{was the state}} adoption of Daylight Saving Time, which Daniels argued would save the state money on energy costs. Although the state is in the Eastern Time Zone, Indiana's counties had adopted their own time zone practices, and in practice the state effectively observed two different times, and {{the central part of}} the state maintained a single time—Eastern Standard—year round. Interests for both EST and CST time zones had prevented the official adoption of daylight saving since the 1930s, and had led to decades of debate. Daniels pressed for the entire state to switch to Central Time, but the General Assembly could not come to terms. Ultimately after a long debate, they adopted Eastern Daylight Saving Time in April 2005, the measure passing by one vote, putting all but northwestern and southwestern Indiana on the same time for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The 1986 SQL {{standard}} basically adopted Codd's proposal {{after an}} implementation prototype in IBM System R. Although Don Chamberlin recognized nulls (alongside duplicate rows) as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>controversial</b> features of SQL, he defended {{the design of}} Nulls in SQL invoking the pragmatic arguments {{that it was the}} least expensive form of system support for missing information, saving the programmer from many duplicative application-level checks (see semipredicate problem) {{while at the same time}} providing the database designer with the option not to use Nulls if he so desires; for example, in order to avoid well known anomalies (discussed in the semantics section of this article). Chamberlin also argued that besides providing some missing-value functionality, practical experience with Nulls also led to other language features which rely on Nulls, like certain grouping constructs and outer joins. Finally, he argued that in practice Nulls also end up being used as a quick way to patch an existing schema when it needs to evolve beyond its original intent, coding not for missing but rather for inapplicable information; for example, a database that quickly needs to support electric cars while having a miles-per-gallon column.|$|E

5|$|The American {{official}} most {{associated with}} the conflict in Laos was Ambassador William H. Sullivan, who served from December 1964 until June 1969. He was also <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>controversial.</b> Considered brilliant by most and tyrannical by many, Sullivan was despised by the American high command (both Army and Air Force) in Saigon, Sullivan's demand that he alone maintain complete control over every aspect of American military operations in Laos and the stringent restrictions that he imposed upon those operations, earned him few friends among the military. Few of his detractors, however, considered the difficulties of the ambassador's position. He had to balance the competing interests of the CIA, the Seventh Air Force, MACV, and the Thais, and {{this had to be}} done without alienating Souvanna Phouma, an ally in all but name who acquiesced to almost every U.S. action within his country, short of outright invasion.|$|E
5|$|The {{right to}} privacy is not {{explicitly}} identified in the U.S. Constitution, but the ACLU led the charge to establish such rights in the indecisive 1961 Poe v. Ullman case, which addressed a state statute outlawing contraception. The issue arose again in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), {{and this time the}} Supreme Court adopted the ACLU's position, and formally declared a {{right to privacy}}. The New York affiliate of the ACLU pushed to eliminate anti-abortion laws starting in 1964, a year before Griswold was decided, and in 1967 the ACLU itself formally adopted the right to abortion as a policy. The ACLU led the defense in United States v. Vuitch which expanded the right of physicians to determine when abortions were necessary. These efforts culminated in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>controversial</b> Supreme Court decisions of all time, Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion {{in the first three months}} of pregnancy. The ACLU successfully argued against state bans on interracial marriage, in the case of Loving v. Virginia (1967).|$|E
5|$|Craig {{retired from}} {{first-class}} cricket at just 26years {{of age in}} 1962, but continued playing for Mosman in Sydney grade cricket on weekends until 1969. His marriage to Rosslyn Carroll in 1962 and his pharmaceutical career prevented him from applying himself fully to cricket. The couple had {{a boy and a}} girl, as well as an adopted son. Craig joined the Australian subsidiary of the British pharmaceutical firm Boots, rising to the position of managing director. He later served {{on the board of directors}} of the Bradman Museum in Bowral and later became its chairman. He was a board member of the New South Wales Cricket Association (NSWCA) for three years and served on the Trust of the Sydney Cricket Ground for varying periods from 1968 to 1996, totalling 18years. Upon first being appointed in 1968 to replace Stan McCabe, Craig was the youngest ever trustee of the SCG. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>controversial</b> incidents during this time occurred in 1977–78 during the period of the breakaway World Series Cricket, which wanted to install floodlights at the SCG. The NSWCA opposed this, while the government sided with WSC. As a result of Craig's support of the NSWCA, the government dismissed him. Craig retired as the managing director of Boots' Australian subsidiaries. Craig was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 1997 for his contributions to cricket as a player and administrator. He died in Bowral from cancer on 16 November 2014.|$|E
