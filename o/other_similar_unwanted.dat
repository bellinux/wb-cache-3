The objective was to study an attack system to perform the dangerous [...] "suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD)" [...] mission, or in other words to destroy enemy anti-aircraft gun and SAM sites. The project was known as HAVE LEMON, a somewhat odd choice of name, since in US slang a [...] "lemon" [...] is a troublesome and worthless automobile, or <b>similar</b> <b>unwanted</b> machine.|$|R
