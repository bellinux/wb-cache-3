During multiplayer games, each player will only see their respective screen (in full HD) appear on the television through their respective 3D glasses, instead <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>a</b> split screen (e.g. player 1 will only see player 1's screen displayed through their 3D glasses).|$|E

25|$|Some {{authors have}} speculated that a few Megalapteryx didinus may have persisted in remote corners of New Zealand until the 18th and even 19th centuries, but this view is not widely accepted. Some Māori hunters claimed to be {{in pursuit of the}} moa as late as the 1770s. Whalers and sealers {{recalled}} seeing monstrous birds along the coast of the South Island, and in the 1820s, a man named George Pauley made an unverified claim <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>a</b> moa in the Otago region of New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Soras forage {{while walking}} or swimming. They are omnivores, eating seeds, insects and snails. Although soras {{are more often}} heard than seen, they are {{sometimes}} seen walking near open water. They are fairly common, despite a decrease in suitable habitat in recent times. The call is a slow whistled ker-whee, or a descending whinny. The use of call broadcasts greatly increases the chances of hearing a sora. Call broadcasts can also increase the chances <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>a</b> sora, as they will often investigate {{the source of the}} call.|$|E

25|$|Georges Dumézil on {{the other}} hand {{proposed}} the theory of the irreducibility and interdependence of the three aspects (sovereignty, war, fertility) in goddesses that he interprets as an original, irreducible structure as hypothesised in his hypothesis of the trifunctional ideology of the Indoeuropeans. While Dumézil's refusal <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>a</b> Greek influence in Italic Junos looks difficult to maintain {{in the light of the}} contributions of archaeology, his comparative analysis of the divine structure is supported by many scholars, as M. Renard and J. Poucet. His theory purports that while male gods incarnated one single function, there are female goddesses who make up a synthesis of the three functions, as a reflection of the ideal of woman's role in society. Even though such a deity has a peculiar affinity for one function, generally fertility, i. e. the third, she is nevertheless equally competent in each of the three.|$|E
25|$|Inside {{the cortex}} vault, Clara manages to awaken Rusty's memory <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>a</b> star's {{creation}}. The Doctor then links {{his mind to}} Rusty's consciousness, showing him the beauty of creation and life, along with the destruction the Daleks caused. However, Rusty not only regains his morality, he also assimilates the Doctor's own deep-rooted hatred towards the Dalek race. He exterminates his fellow Daleks {{as they attempt to}} destroy the rebel ship. After leaving the inside of the Dalek, the Doctor parts with Rusty, disturbed that the Dalek saw only darkness within him; he'd hoped for a 'victory' in creating a 'good' Dalek. Rusty's response is that the Doctor himself is a good Dalek, while Rusty is not. Rusty sends a signal to the Dalek mothership, causing it to believe the Aristotle has self-destructed, and vows to continue with his mission to destroy the Daleks.|$|E

500|$|The David Sheldrick Trust runs a {{sanctuary}} {{in the park}} that hand-rears orphaned elephant and rhinoceros calves, and later releases them back into secure sanctuaries. Orphaned and sick animals are brought to the sanctuary from all over Kenya. The sanctuary is located close to the park's main entrance. It was opened in 1963. It {{was set up by}} Daphne Sheldrick after the death of her husband David Sheldrick, the anti-poaching warden of Tsavo National Park. Nairobi National Park is sometimes called Kifaru Ark, which means [...] "Rhinoceros Sanctuary".

500|$|The {{landscape}} {{paintings of}} Dutch painter Johan Barthold Jongkind (18191891) influenced both Boudin and Monet {{and contributed to}} the development of early Impressionism. After meeting Jongkind in Sainte-Adresse in 1862, Monet began to cultivate an interest in Jongkind's perspective on the changing conditions of the landscape. From Jongkind, Monet learned to substitute optical color for local color. [...] "Complementing the teaching I received from Boudin, Jongkind was from that moment my true master," [...] Monet later reminisced. [...] "It was he who completed the education of my eye". This new way <b>of</b> <b>seeing,</b> <b>a</b> shift from a conceptual to a perceptual approach, formed the basis for Monet's Haystacks (1890-1891), a series of 25 works showing the effects of dynamic atmospheric conditions over time on a single haystack motif.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{generally}} agreed that Ensemble re-created the Halo universe's aesthetic well. Gillen said knowledge of the game universe could alleviate some issues of player ignorance regarding units' actions: [...] "It's not just the geek thrill <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>a</b> Scarab in action—it's that you understand what the Scarab means on the battlefield (trouble)," [...] he wrote. [...] "We know which characters are best against tanks, and which are probably best in special vehicles." [...] Nguyen said that, although the core units meshed well, the inclusion of Ensemble-developed units gave Halo Wars {{the feeling of a}} generic science-fiction title. While giving the game a mixed review, Anderson said that the authentic-looking units and environments went a long way to integrating the game {{with the rest of the}} series. Wilcox commented that with the Halo-inspired menu system and Rippy's score, [...] "before the campaign even begins, the message is clear: this is still very much a Halo game." [...] Overall, Halo Wars was judged a fitting final game for Ensemble.|$|E
500|$|Historian Allan Nevins, in his {{foreword}} to Walters' {{biography of}} Foraker, suggested that Foraker did not attain the presidency, {{as he had}} hoped, because of the ambitions of other Ohio politicians. While Foraker might have secured the nomination in 1888 as a compromise candidate, had not his pledges to Sherman prevented it, having [...] "stood aside for an older man year after year he was compelled to stand aside for younger leaders. [...] First McKinley, with Hanna at his side, was given precedence; then Taft, whom Foraker had given a start in public life, scaled the peak. [...] Foraker, for all his administrative capacity, his wide popular appeal, and his unflinching courage, had the tragic lot <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>a</b> succession of associates go above him." [...] Even Foraker's final defeat, in 1914, proved {{to be part of}} the political rise of another president from Ohio, Harding. Nevins noted the aggressive nature of Foraker's political style, and commented, [...] "How much of his failure to reach high office was attributable to ill fortune and how much to some of his traits, readers … may judge for themselves." [...] Cincinnati editor Murat Halstead, a contemporary, attributed the fact that Foraker did not get nominated in 1888 to the surplus of ambitious Ohio men at the convention: [...] in addition to Sherman, Foraker, and McKinley, even Harrison had been born in Ohio.|$|E
500|$|The episode has {{received}} mixed to positive responses from critics. Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, rated the episode an A, calling it [...] "utterly bad-ass". Handlen {{felt that the}} episode effectively toyed with the series' usual narrative structure, making lead character Fox Mulder seem [...] "nearly {{as much of an}} antagonist" [...] as The Smoking Man; Handlen also felt that [...] "Zero Sum" [...] gave significant insight into the character of Walter Skinner. Paula Vitaris, writing for Cinefantastique, rated [...] "Zero Sum" [...] one-and-a-half stars out of four, noting that its [...] "pacing and tone are off". Vitaris felt that [...] "Duchovny and Pileggi give good performances", despite Pileggi seeming [...] "unintentionally comic" [...] at times; though she noted that [...] "an episode without Scully feels pretty empty". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, noting that [...] "Pileggi looks much more comfortable here than he did in last year's showcase [...] ". Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode's attempts to tie into the wider storylines—the appearance of Marita Covarrubias in particular—are where it [...] "really stumbles"; noting that its success lies [...] "in the shock value <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>a</b> deliberately familiar story through the fractured view of another character".|$|E
