5|$|Quantitatively, of all {{elemental}} chlorine produced, about 63% {{is used in}} the manufacture of organic compounds, and 18% in the manufacture of inorganic chlorine compounds. About 15,000 chlorine compounds are used commercially. The remaining 19% of chlorine produced is used for bleaches and disinfection products. The most significant of organic compounds in terms of production volume are 1,2-dichloroethane and vinyl chloride, intermediates in the production of PVC. Other particularly important <b>organochlorines</b> are methyl chloride, methylene chloride, chloroform, vinylidene chloride, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, allyl chloride, epichlorohydrin, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzenes, and trichlorobenzenes.

5|$|Human {{activities}} have affected stocks of {{many species of}} teleost, through overfishing, pollution and global warming. Among many recorded instances, overfishing caused the complete collapse of the Atlantic cod population off Newfoundland in 1992, leading to Canada's indefinite closure of the fishery. Pollution, especially in rivers and along coasts, has harmed teleosts as sewage, pesticides and herbicides have entered the water. Many pollutants, such as heavy metals, <b>organochlorines,</b> and carbamates interfere with teleost reproduction, often by disrupting their endocrine systems. In the roach, river pollution has caused the intersex condition, in which an individual's gonads contain both cells that can make male gametes (such as spermatogonia) and cells that can make female gametes (such as oogonia). Since endocrine disruption also affects humans, teleosts are used to indicate the presence of such chemicals in water. Water pollution caused local extinction of teleost populations in many northern European lakes {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{presence}} of <b>organochlorine</b> pesticides {{in the environment}} is {{a serious threat to}} human health and requires continuous monitoring. Therefore, in the present systematic review, the residual amount of different <b>organochlorine</b> pesticides in human samples has been investigated. Methods: All accessible databases in English and Farsi were searched by using <b>organochlorine</b> and related pesticides keywords in Farsi databases including SID, Iranmedex, magiran and Medlib and English databases including PubMed and Google Scholar. All articles which had evaluated one of the <b>organochlorine</b> pesticides were included. Data including the research data, sample size, location, biologic sample, pesticide type and the amount of <b>organochlorine</b> pesticide measured were extracted. Results: A total of 17 documented cases were extracted from 10 primary studies in which mean residual <b>organochlorine</b> pepticides in human had been determined. The studied samples were 5 samples of pregnant women's hair, 10 samples of maternal milk, and 2 samples of fat tissue.

25|$|Many {{pesticides}} can {{be grouped}} into chemical families. Prominent insecticide families include <b>organochlorines,</b> organophosphates, and carbamates. Organochlorine hydrocarbons (e.g., DDT) could be separated into dichlorodiphenylethanes, cyclodiene compounds, {{and other related}} compounds. They operate by disrupting the sodium/potassium balance of the nerve fiber, forcing the nerve to transmit continuously. Their toxicities vary greatly, {{but they have been}} phased out because of their persistence and potential to bioaccumulate. Organophosphate and carbamates largely replaced <b>organochlorines.</b> Both operate through inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, allowing acetylcholine to transfer nerve impulses indefinitely and causing a variety of symptoms such as weakness or paralysis. Organophosphates are quite toxic to vertebrates and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates. Thiocarbamate and dithiocarbamates are subclasses of carbamates. Prominent families of herbicides include phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides (e.g. 2,4-D), triazines (e.g., atrazine), ureas (e.g., diuron), and Chloroacetanilides (e.g., alachlor). Phenoxy compounds tend to selectively kill broad-leaf weeds rather than grasses. The phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides function similar to plant growth hormones, and grow cells without normal cell division, crushing the plant's nutrient transport system. Triazines interfere with photosynthesis. Many commonly used pesticides are not included in these families, including glyphosate.|$|E

Beginning in 1999, studies made by Greenpeace and others from soil, groundwater, well water and vegetables from the residential areas around UCIL and from the UCIL factory area show contamination with a range of toxic heavy metals and chemical compounds. Substances found, according to the reports, are naphthol, naphthalene, Sevin, tarry residues, alpha naphthol, mercury, <b>organochlorines,</b> chromium, copper, nickel, lead, hexachlorethane, hexachlorobutadiene, pesticide HCH (BHC), volatile organic compounds and halo-organics.

2500|$|Since before 2000 BC, {{humans have}} {{utilized}} pesticides {{to protect their}} crops. The first known pesticide was elemental sulfur dusting used in ancient Sumer about 4,500 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia. The Rig Veda, which is about 4,000 years old, mentions the use of poisonous plants for pest control. By the 15th century, toxic chemicals such as arsenic, mercury, and lead were being applied to crops to kill pests. In the 17th century, nicotine sulfate was extracted from tobacco leaves for use as an insecticide. The 19th century saw the introduction of two more natural pesticides, pyrethrum, which is derived from chrysanthemums, and rotenone, which {{is derived from the}} roots of tropical vegetables. Until the 1950s, arsenic-based pesticides were dominant. [...] Paul Müller discovered that DDT was a very effective insecticide. <b>Organochlorines</b> such as DDT were dominant, but they were replaced in the U.S. by organophosphates and carbamates by 1975. Since then, pyrethrin compounds have become the dominant insecticide. Herbicides became common in the 1960s, led by [...] "triazine and other nitrogen-based compounds, carboxylic acids such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and glyphosate".|$|E

40|$|Despite {{widespread}} {{usage of}} <b>organochlorine</b> insecticides in the Queensland sugar industry from 1947 to 1987, there is remarkably little {{information on the}} use and environmental consequences of their usage. This thesis explores three aspects of <b>organochlorine</b> insecticide use in two significant sugarcane growing regions in North Queensland, the Herbert and Burdekin River regions. The first is the distribution of <b>organochlorine</b> insecticide residues in sugarcane soils and coastal and riverine sediments in both regions to assess the current distribution of <b>organochlorine</b> insecticide residues and provide information on historical inputs to coastal sediments.

So, {{in an attempt to}} access the impacts of pesticides usage in agriculture in Benin, research of some residual organochloride pesticides have been conducted both in rainy and dry seasons in two cotton growing areas: the northern and central part of Benin. The analytical technique used is GC-ECD. During the dry season we notice that the DDT and its metabolites (DDE and DDD) represent 36 % of all <b>organochlorine</b> pesticides (POCs) against 64 % of cyclodiens. Endosulfan comes first representing 57 % of all <b>organochlorine</b> pesticides (POCs), then follows DDT with 17 %.
