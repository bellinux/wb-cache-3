5|$|Poveiros have {{migrated}} {{to other places}} and this attenuated the population growth. One should notice that the Poveiros tended {{to create their own}} associations abroad, there are Casa dos Poveiros (Poveiros House) in Brazil (Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo), Germiston in South Africa and Toronto in Canada. In Rio de Janeiro, the community was known by not wanting other peoples of <b>other</b> <b>origins,</b> including Portuguese born in other regions, within their community. In 1920, many Poveiros emigrated in Brazil returned, as many refused to lose Portuguese nationality. The governor of Angola, with an ambition to develop fisheries, suggested the creation of a Povoan colony in Porto Alexandre. Due to fisher classes affairs, the fisher areas of Vila do Conde, Esposende and Matosinhos have strong Povoan cultural influence and half of the population of Vila do Conde and Matosinhos are of Povoan descent.|$|E

25|$|Lacquerware is {{a longstanding}} {{tradition}} in Japan, {{and at some}} point kintsugi may have been combined with maki-e as a replacement for other ceramic repair techniques. One theory is that kintsugi may have originated when Japanese shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa sent a damaged Chinese tea bowl back to China for repairs in the late 15th century. When it was returned, repaired with ugly metal staples, it may have prompted Japanese craftsmen to look for a more aesthetic means of repair. Collectors became so enamored with the new art that some were accused of deliberately smashing valuable pottery so it could be repaired with the gold seams of kintsugi. Kintsugi became closely associated with ceramic vessels used for chanoyu (Japanese tea ceremony). While the process is associated with Japanese craftsmen, the technique was also applied to ceramic pieces of <b>other</b> <b>origins</b> including China, Vietnam, and Korea.|$|E
25|$|Most autopsy {{findings}} {{relate to}} asphyxia {{and are not}} specific to drowning. The signs of drowning are degraded by decomposition. Large amounts of froth will be present around the mouth and nostrils and in {{the upper and lower}} airways in freshly drowned bodies. The volume of froth is generally much greater in drowning than from <b>other</b> <b>origins.</b> Lung density may be higher than normal but normal weights are possible after cardiac arrest reflex or vaso-vagal reflex. The lungs may be over inflated and waterlogged, filling the thoracic cavity, and the surface may have a marbled appearance, with darker areas associated with collapsed alveoli interspersed with paler aerated areas. Fluid trapped in the lower airways may block the passive collapse that is normal after death. Haemorrhagic bullae of emphysema may be found. These are related to rupture of alveolar walls. These signs, while suggestive of drowning, are not conclusive.|$|E

500|$|It is also {{possible}} that the mound is actually a cenotaph rather than a grave, the only sign of body was a chemical stain which could have had <b>other</b> <b>origins,</b> indeed the site includes burials of both meat and companion animals. [...] Further {{there is a lack of}} shroud ties, and no clear evidence of items which might have adorned a body being left in the expected places in relation to the stain. [...] The cenotaph theory may be consistent with the transition from pagan burial to Christian burial, certainly as far as Rædwald is concerned, he could have received a Christian burial, and the mound, whether completed before or after his conversion being used as a memorial and as symbol of the status of the Kingship of East Anglia.|$|E
500|$|However, the Joker's {{unreliable}} {{memory has}} allowed writers to develop <b>other</b> <b>origins</b> for the character. [...] "Case Study", a Paul Dini-Alex Ross story, describes the Joker as a sadistic gangster who creates the Red Hood identity {{to continue the}} thrill of small-time criminality. He has his fateful first meeting with Batman, which results in his disfigurement. It is suggested that the Joker is sane, and feigns insanity to avoid the death penalty. In Batman Confidential (#7–12), the character, Jack, is a talented criminal who is bored with his work. He encounters (and becomes obsessed with) Batman during a heist, embarking on a crime spree to attract his attention. After Jack injures Batman's girlfriend, Batman scars Jack's face with a permanent grin and betrays him {{to a group of}} mobsters, who torture him in a chemical plant. Jack escapes, but falls into an empty vat as gunfire punctures chemical tanks above him. The flood of chemicals (used in anti-psychotic medication) alters his appearance and completes his transformation. The superhero Atom sees the Joker's memory of burning his parents alive (after they find him killing animals) in The Brave and the Bold #31, and Snyder's [...] "" [...] (2013) suggests that the pre-disfigured Joker was a criminal mastermind leading a gang of Red Hoods.|$|E

2500|$|Shabbat ( [...] ; [...] , [...] "rest" [...] or [...] "cessation") or Shabbos ( [...] , [...] ) or the Sabbath is Judaism's day of {{rest and}} seventh day of the week, on which {{religious}} Jews and certain Christians (such as Seventh Day Adventists and Seventh Day Baptists) remember the Biblical creation of the heavens and the earth in six days and the Exodus of the Hebrews, {{and look forward to}} a future Messianic Age. Shabbat observance entails refraining from work activities, often with great rigor, and engaging in restful activities to honor the day. Judaism's traditional position is that unbroken seventh-day Shabbat originated among the Jewish people, as their first and most sacred institution, though some suggest <b>other</b> <b>origins.</b> Variations upon Shabbat are widespread in Judaism and, with adaptations, throughout the Abrahamic and many other religions.|$|E

2500|$|Gargish is the {{language}} of the gargoyles of Britannia and {{the language}} used in spellcasting within the game. Unlike the runic script, which is usually used simply as a visual cipher for English, the Gargish script encodes a genuine constructed language, based on (but expanding greatly upon) the magical words of power that first saw use in , as well as the mantras for each of the Shrines of Virtue, which had remained consistent since [...] The lexicon mostly comprises deformed or truncated Latinate stems (flam [...] "fire" [...] ← Latin flamma; lap [...] "stone" [...] ← Latin lapis; leg [...] "to read" [...] ← Latin legō), but <b>other</b> <b>origins</b> are also apparent (uis [...] "wisdom" [...] ← English wise; kas [...] "helmet" [...] ← French casque).
