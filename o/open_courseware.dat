40|$|Abstract: The {{internet}} {{has become an}} accepted medium of instruction for distance education and independent learning. However, {{there is still a}} lack of appropriate course material. Even when the material is available, it is often highly priced, of uncertain quality and very rarely in local languages. Hence, {{there is a need for}} good quality, cost effective courseware available in multiple languages, with large scale dissemination. With this perspective, Project OSCAR (<b>Open</b> Source <b>Courseware</b> Animations Repository) aims to create a large repository of web-based, interactive animations of various concepts and technologies. This paper intends to highlight the development methodology and the efforts in making these animations available. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{field of}} {{information}} technology extends continuously. This implies an increased number of IT professionals as well as rapidly evolving technologies. In universities, {{the challenge is to}} manage increasingly large student groups, {{while at the same time}} the teachers need to use a lot of time in developing new IT courses and updating the old courses. Unfortunately, many universities face the lack of teaching resources to deal with the situation. To address these problems we have started an <b>Open</b> Source <b>Courseware</b> (OSCu) project. The fundamental goal of the project is to increase cooperation between universities in course development. In this project we produce open source course materials, and use these materials for distributing courses to several universities. The distributed course model offers universities an easy and inexpensive way to broaden their course selection and to distribute knowledge between teaching personnel from different universities. This paper introduces the principles of the course material production and the distributed course organization in the OSCu project. We also discuss the issues noticed when planning and implementing our first course according these principles during spring 2002...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Open</b> Source <b>Courseware</b> Initiative (OSCINZ) was {{a project}} funded through the e-Learning Collaborative Development Fund. It {{was led by}} the Waikato Institute of Technology and {{included}} representation from Wellington Institute of Technology, Northland Polytechnic and BEST Training. The project was formulated {{as a response to}} the clear direction from Government and the Tertiary Education Commission that the tertiary sector must increase the level of collaboration to avoid wasteful duplication of effort and ensure greater consistency in the development of new resources. Three distinct elements were integrated within the project to maximise the benefits of the project to the tertiary sector. In essence the three elements of the project were; •	The creation of a robust, financially-viable open source learning management system that meets the needs of the cultural populations of Aotearoa. •	The creation of learning opportunities for staff, students and communities in the concepts of e-learning e-teaching and e-environments. •	The creation of a foundation course to test the system's robustness and engage students in authentic e-activities. The applicants believe the support provided from the e-Learning Collaborative Development Fund has enabled them to have the infrastructure and mechanisms in place to ensure a continued, coordinated and collaborative approach to the development of open source e-Learning capability in New Zealand...|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} this small panel {{discussion}} {{will focus on the}} long-term curation of open and mostly <b>open</b> access <b>courseware</b> assets; however, this focus is centered on balancing student engagement through re/mixed and re/used media and their respective tools and knowledge management principles. This panel will seek to open a dialogue with all levels of instruction from the students and online staff and faculty to the departments of Administration and Information Technology. In the rapid advance toward the worthwhile goal of offering equal access to education and providing more opportunities for non-traditional students through online classes and MOOC’s there is little on how to better curate and preserve the increasing number of born-digital assets and information about how to balance this with the growing number of mixed media tools available is sparse at best. How can online instructors and professors integrate new tools and methodologies into their curriculum to better engage with their students? How will these new tools and methods like gamification, video sharing and hangout sites, and other social media platforms be effectively used, curated, archived and accessed by both student and instructor alike? Additionally, what are the logistical, intellectual property and academic freedom issues that might and will continue to rise in the future with online classes? This panel will touch on all of these questions briefly in the hope that this conversation will continue to encourage further debate on these issues...|$|R

40|$|The Best Practices for Biomedical Big Data {{project is}} a two year {{collaboration}} between Harvard Medical School and University of Massachusetts Medical School, funded by the NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD 2 K) Initiative for Resource Development. The Best Practices for Biomedical Research Data Management Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) provides training to librarians, biomedical researchers, undergraduate and graduate biomedical students, and other interested individuals on recommended practices facilitating the discoverability, access, integrity, reuse value, privacy, security, and long term preservation of biomedical research data. This poster highlights {{lessons learned from the}} first year of this project. Built upon the New England Collaborative Data Management Curriculum, the development team sought to use existing curricular materials to create a fully online course. The course is designed with an open course platform, WordPress Learning Management System (WPLMS), in order to facilitate broad access. Each of the MOOC’s nine modules is dedicated to a specific component of data management best practices and includes video lectures, presentation slides, research teaching cases, readings, activities, and interactive quizzes. The project team overcame multiple challenges related to creating an open online course: curriculum, audience and software. Working towards overcoming these, the Best Practices for Biomedical Research Data Management MOOC development team has moved slowly and deliberately, created additional content, and added content experts to provide guidance. These lessons learned will assist course development beyond this project, adding to best practices for creating massive <b>open</b> online <b>courseware.</b> Lessons learned include: teaching method influences the curriculum and content should not be developed in isolation from the teaching method; content is dependent on audience and supplementary content can be used to bridge audience gaps; and implementing new or unfamiliar technologies is challenging so allow more time in the timeline for project team to work with open source platform...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a project for}} providing the students of Structural Engineering with the flexibility to learn outside classroom schedules. The goal is a framework for adaptive E-learning based on a repository of <b>open</b> educational <b>courseware</b> {{with a set of}} basic Structural Engineering concepts and fundamentals. These are paramount for students to expand their technical knowledge and skills in structural analysis and design of tall buildings, arch-type structures as well as bridges. Thus, concepts related to structural behaviour such as linearity, compatibility, stiffness and influence lines have traditionally been elusive for students. The objective is to facilitate the student a teachinglearning process to acquire the necessary intuitive knowledge, cognitive skills and the basis for further technological modules and professional development in this area. As a side effect, the system is expected to help the students improve their preparation for exams on the subject. In this project, a web-based open-source system for studying influence lines on continuous beams is presented. It encompasses a collection of interactive user-friendly applications accessible via Web, written in JavaScript under JQuery and Dygraph Libraries, taking advantage of their efficiency and graphic capabilities. It is performed in both Spanish and English languages. The student is enabled to set the geometric, topologic, boundary and mechanic layout of a continuous beam. While changing the loading and the support conditions, the changes in the beam response prompt on the screen, so that the effects of the several issues involved in structural analysis become apparent. This open interaction with the user allows the student to simulate and virtually infer the structural response. Different levels of complexity can be handled, whereas an ongoing help is at hand for any of them. Students can freely boost their experiential learning on this subject at their own pace, in order to further share, process, generalize and apply the relevant essential concepts of Structural Engineering analysis. Besides, this collection is being added to the "Virtual Lab of Continuum Mechanics" of the UPM, launched in 2013 ([URL]...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the rationale, common practices, challenges, and some personal anecdotes from a journal editor on the production, use, and re-use of peer-reviewed scholarly articles as {{open educational resources}} (OER). The scholarly and professional discourse related to open educational resources has largely focused on <b>open</b> learning objects, <b>courseware,</b> and textbooks. However, especially in graduate education, articles published in scholarly journals are often {{a major component of}} the course content in formal education. In addition, open access journal articles are critical to expanding access to knowledge by scholars in the developing world and in fostering citizen science, by which everyone has access to the latest academic information and research results. In this article, I highlight some of the challenges, economic models, and evidence for quality of open access journal content and look at new affordances provided by the Net for enhanced functionality, access, and distribution. In the 17 years since I graduated with a doctorate degree, the climate and acceptance of open access publishing has almost reversed itself. I recall a conversation with my PhD supervisor in which he argued that publishing online was not a viable option as the product would not have permanency, scholarly recognition, or the prestige of a paper publication. His comments reflect the confusion between online resources and those described as open access, but as well illustrate the change in academic acceptance and use of open access products during the past decade. The evolution from paper to online production and consumption is a disruptive technology in which much lower cost and increased accessibility of online work opens the product to a completely new group of potential users. In the case of OER these consumers are primarily students, but certainly access to scholars {{from all parts of the}} globe and the availability to support citizen science (Silvertown, 2009) should not be underestimated...|$|R
