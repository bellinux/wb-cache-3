5|$|Confessions Tour was {{the seventh}} concert tour by American singer-songwriter Madonna. It {{supported}} her tenth studio album, Confessions on a Dance Floor. Madonna confirmed the possibility <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> {{on a tour}} as early as November 2005. Jamie King, Madonna's longtime collaborator, was then hired on to direct. The set list consisted of mainly songs from the supporting studio album and rehearsals started during 2006. As with many of her prior tours, the Confessions Tour {{did not go to}} Australia, prompting Madonna to release an apology statement on her website.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary Theravada orthodoxy regards samatha as a {{preparation}} for vipassanā, pacifying {{the mind and}} strengthening the concentration {{in order to allow}} the work of insight, which leads to liberation. In contrast, the Vipassana Movement argues that insight levels can be discerned without the need for developing samatha further due to the risks <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> of the course when strong samatha is developed.|$|E

25|$|Standard Gravure was a {{prominent}} printing company founded in 1922 by Barry Bingham Sr. Reduced revenues led to an employee wage freeze in 1982, and in 1986 the Bingham family sold the company. Standard Gravure's customers were retailers, {{many of which were}} in the process <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> of business, and at the same time, paper shortages were occurring in the marketplace.|$|E
25|$|In postwar cricket, the happy-go-lucky Somerset {{attitude}} {{was no longer}} sustainable, and the side finished bottom of the Championship for four consecutive seasons from 1952. With the strong possibility <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> of business, drastic change was inevitable. Somerset recruited heavily from other countries, taking Colin McCool and Bill Alley from Australia, and from other counties. In 1958, under the captaincy of the first professional cricketer to captain the team, Maurice Tremlett, the side again finished third, and this was repeated in 1963 and 1966 under different captains, Harold Stephenson and Colin Atkinson, who later became headmaster at Millfield School.|$|E

25|$|The word koladera {{initially}} {{referred to}} the act <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> and singing the colá. According to the oral tradition, a new musical genre appeared in the 1930s when the composer Anton’ Tchitch’ intentionally speeded up the tempo of a morna. Someone in the crowd {{is said to have}} shouted “já Bocê v’rá-’l n’um coladêra” (you have transformed it in a coladeira), i.e., a morna performed with the tempo and liveliness of a koladera. Technically, the coladeira appeared as a division in half of the length of the notes of the morna, through the acceleration of the tempo.|$|E
25|$|Toadie tells Sonya {{that he has}} {{received}} poison pen letters about her and she becomes fearful <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>out.</b> Mark suspects that Patricia might be sending the letters, as Toadie is representing Josh Willis (Harley Bonner), who attacked her son. Sonya dismisses Mark's suspicions. After Nell has an accident at the local park, Sonya receives {{a visit from the}} DHS after someone makes a formal complaint against her. Sonya then realises someone is watching her. When she worries that another complaint to the DHS could result in Nell being taken into care, Sonya is tempted to drink some wine. Sonya's stalker breaks into her bedroom where Nell is sleeping and hits Mark over the head. The stalker breaks in again and is revealed to be Sonya's former best friend Erin Rogers. Erin blames Sonya for introducing her to drugs and the subsequent loss of her daughter to the DHS. Sonya feels guilty and pays Erin's bail. She also offers her a job at her nursery and gets her into a drug treatment program. Sonya lends Erin money to buy a dress, but she suspects Erin is meeting a drug dealer and follows her. She is assaulted and her bag is stolen. Erin later tells Sonya she did not buy drugs. Erin's daughter Cat (Maleeka Gasbarri) visits Erin and Sonya reveals that Erin was present at Cat's cricket games; Cat becomes upset as Erin did not reveal herself and leaves, causing Erin to fallout with Sonya again. Cat later returns and things go much better, but the pressure gets to Erin and she flees. Cat asks to live with Toadie and Sonya, but Sonya helps her reconcile with her foster mother instead. Sonya befriends Amy Williams (Zoe Cramond) and invites her and her son to stay at Number 30.|$|E

The Disney Channel promos for Phineas and Ferb describe him as someone who [...] "thinks big", refusing to let any day be ordinary. Povenmire also characterizes him as assertive, someone so secure in his abilities that others assume he is a prodigy. Povenmire and Marsh wanted the series to reflect their own childhood memories <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> {{during the summer and}} have fun, digging trenches and building tunnels, forts, and tree houses.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{before the}} end of the 1982–83 Football League season, Robert Maxwell, the then-owner and {{chairman}} of Oxford United Football Club, announced that he had made a deal with the owners of nearby Reading to amalgamate the two teams to create a new club he proposed to name [...] "Thames Valley Royals". This appellation combined a loose term for the geographical region, [...] "Thames Valley", with the Reading team's nickname, [...] "the Royals". With each team having financial problems, Maxwell claimed that both were on the verge <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> of business and that uniting them was necessary for the region to retain a Football League club.|$|E
500|$|Former Gillingham player Damien Richardson {{became the}} club's next manager, with veteran goalkeeper Ron Hillyard as his assistant, but the club's {{financial}} situation was {{poor and the}} pair struggled to produce results with a squad composed of ageing journeymen and untried youngsters, and both men were sacked in September 1992, with Glenn Roeder taking over as manager. [...] Gillingham's league status was in jeopardy {{for most of the}} 1992–93 Division Three campaign, with relegation to the Football Conference a distinct possibility until the last home match of the season, when a 2–0 win over Halifax Town ensured the club's survival. [...] Nonetheless, the financial crisis continued at Priestfield, and steadily improving league form over the next two seasons did little to disguise the fact that the club was in real danger <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> of existence.|$|E
500|$|Film {{director}} Kevin Smith, who {{had been}} a fan of Degrassi from the early 1990s when he worked at a convenience store in Leonardo, New Jersey, has paid homage to Degrassi by making reference to it in several of his films. For example, he named a Clerks character Caitlin Bree after Caitlin Ryan, his favorite Degrassi character, wrote Shannen Doherty's character Rene wearing a Degrassi jacket throughout his Mallrats film, and had Jason Lee's character in Chasing Amy specifically mention Degrassi Junior High as the television show he would rather be watching, instead <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>out.</b> At the press conference for the new series, Schuyler announced that Smith would appear in [...] "Mother and Child Reunion" [...] as Caitlin's boyfriend, but due to scheduling conflicts he was unable to film the role and it was passed on to Don McKellar. Smith and his View Askewniverse sidekick Jason Mewes later guest starred in Degrassi: The Next Generation for three episodes of season four, two episodes of season five, and four episodes of season eight.|$|E

500|$|The {{title of}} the album, The Hunting Party, is a contextual metaphor. The album, {{a return to the}} band's {{original}} harder rock-centric sounds, represents the band's desire to not only create something different from other rock bands, but to also bring back the [...] "energy and soul" [...] of rock itself, and that Linkin Park are the party that will hunt for that energy and soul. Shinoda elaborated on the {{title of the}} album in an interview with Kerrang! explaining: [...] "We got so sick of other bands trying to be other bands and playing it safe the whole time, so the album name comes from a theory about culture becoming too passive, everyone just standing around waiting for opportunities to come to them instead <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> and getting theirs. I'm aware there {{are always going to be}} heavier bands than us, but The Hunting Party is Linkin Park going out and getting it for ourselves." [...] The inspiration for the title came from a news article Shinoda read online about a Japanese writer's concerns about today's growing society. The writer described the young men of today as [...] "herbivores", and explained how they are essentially grazing, waiting for an opportunity to come to them, rather than hunting for it.|$|E

2500|$|London's fiction {{featured}} several suicides. [...] In his autobiographical memoir John Barleycorn, he claims, as a youth, to have drunkenly stumbled overboard {{into the}} San Francisco Bay, [...] "some maundering fancy <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> with the tide suddenly obsessed me". He said he drifted and nearly succeeded in drowning before sobering up and being rescued by fishermen. In the dénouement of The Little Lady of the Big House, the heroine, {{confronted by the}} pain of a mortal gunshot wound, undergoes a physician-assisted suicide by morphine. Also, in Martin Eden, the principal protagonist, who shares certain characteristics with London, drowns himself.|$|E

But I'm more into the empowerment <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>out,</b> because it's always been the place where I could be myself and get inspired. Even if I'm sad, dancing {{is a way to}} let stuff out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Iacocca was {{strongly}} courted by the Chrysler Corporation, {{at a time}} when the company appeared to be on the verge <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> of business and had just sold its loss-making Chrysler Europe division to Peugeot in an effort to generate cash because the company was losing millions already in North America. This was largely due to recalls of its Dodge Aspen and Plymouth Volare, both of which Iacocca later said should never have been built. [...] Iacocca joined Chrysler and began rebuilding the entire company from the ground up, laying off many workers, and bringing in many former associates from his former company.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, Zevon {{released}} the self-produced Mutineer. The title track was frequently covered by Bob Dylan on his U.S. fall tour in 2002. Zevon's cover of cult artist Judee Sill's [...] "Jesus Was a Crossmaker" [...] predated the wider rediscovery {{of her work}} a decade later. The album, however, suffered the worst sales of Zevon's career, in part because his label, superagent Irving Azoff's short-lived Giant Records, {{was in the process}} <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> of business. Rhino Records released a Zevon [...] "best-of" [...] compilation in 1996, I'll Sleep When I'm Dead. Zevon also appeared on the Larry Sanders Show on HBO, in 1993, playing himself as a guest on the show, promoting Learning to Flinch. Zevon also played himself on two episodes of Suddenly Susan in 1999, along with singer and actor Rick Springfield.|$|E
