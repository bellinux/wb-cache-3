500|$|Dina Meyer starred as Barbara Gordon in the {{television}} series Birds of Prey (2002). It became the first adaptation to show the character's progression from Batgirl to Oracle, which included her paralysis {{at the hands of}} the Joker. Meyer commented on her character's complex history stating: [...] "She's multidimensional. She was a former superhero. She was extremely active physically for years, fighting alongside Batman. The unfortunate incident with the Joker took away the use of her legs... but rather than give up and throw in the towel, as she could've done so easily, she went and studied escrima (a martial art), got stronger in her mental state and, while helping out her father on a case one day, realized she had a knack for solving mysteries. And all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>she</b> became this computer genius." [...] Overall, the series received criticism for its emphasis on aesthetics over plot. It aired for one season before receiving cancellation. In the fourth season of the TV series Arrow, after Felicity Smoak suffered a similar paralyzing injury, Oliver Queen gives her the codename Overwatch while commenting that [...] "Oracle" [...] was taken. Although, in the comic books Barbara Gordon was never a member of the Teen Titans she was slated to appear in the live-action Titans series for TNT. This version of the character will be a wheelchair-bound computer expert, but will not yet be known as Oracle. This series has since been abanndoned ...|$|E

60|$|It is {{said that}} {{familiarity}} breeds contempt. It was obvious that the awesome feeling passed from the infant's mind as she gazed. Under the impulse <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> inspiration <b>she</b> entered the hut, {{went up to the}} nose, and tweaked it.|$|R
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> when <b>she</b> {{was at her}} worst, all the materiality--if {{there be}} such a word--which {{circumstances}} and innate tendency had woven about her as a garment, seemed to melt away, and she became aware of something vast in which she floated like an insect in the atmosphere--some surrounding sea which she could neither measure nor travel.|$|R

500|$|Yeah, I {{really felt}} {{at that point}} she was pretty strung out. Her whole world was rocked.

[...] the realisation that as soon as the baby's born the soul's going to go away, and it's the first time she really experienced true love, so she was going through a lot emotionally. I just didn't think that she would have time to really think about how she looked. I don't think it was a priority, and so for me as an actor it was important that I reveal that. Not get caught up in my own vanity as an actress, and portray the character as where she really was.|$|R

6000|$|... "At last, as {{the winter}} drew on, she altered so much, and {{got such a}} strange look in her face, which never seemed to leave it, that Joshua became alarmed, and said he must send for the doctor.

5000|$|The {{decision}} to announce Southerlyn's homosexuality {{only as the}} character left the show was widely denounced both by fans and critics. Slates Dana Stevens called the line [...] "a cheap stunt", as did USA Todays Robert Bianco and numerous fans. The media director for the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) stated to Chicago Tribune television critic Maureen Ryan, [...] "For a show that usually employs gay and lesbian characters as sensational plot devices, it's really disappointing {{to have one of}} the leads come out five seconds before she exits the show," [...] and Ryan cited as [...] "typical" [...] a fan comment from Universal Television's fan forum that read, [...] "They have never discussed her sexuality on the show before and all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> <b>she's</b> gay in her last two lines? Terrible writing decision." [...] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle joined those calling the move a [...] "cheap stunt", adding, [...] "but here's why it didn't work: Anyone who knows anything about gay people knows that no lesbian could ever be that bad <b>of</b> <b>an</b> actress." [...] Diane Holloway of the Austin American-Statesman was one of many critics who chose to answer Southerlyn's on-screen question, while citing her as third runner-up for <b>a</b> list <b>of</b> [...] "the most annoying actors on television".|$|R

60|$|I {{caught the}} glance in her eyes, {{and they were}} {{literally}} glowing with mischief.

I could only gasp. Astonishment, not to say admiration, at her pluck literally took my breath away.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{when she}} heard these words Noma shrieked aloud, for <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>she</b> felt {{that the power of}} the will of Hokosa, from which she had been freed by him, had once more fallen upon her, and that come what might she was doomed to obey his last commands.|$|E
6000|$|Indeed, {{they all}} {{began to talk}} {{of this or that}} at hazard, but she was not to be put off by such interruptions.

5000|$|... "Guten Morgen!" [...] {{is another}} good example. It is {{possible}} that Son'ka invented this famous method of hotel thefts. The method was simple and insolent - beautifully dressed, elegant Son'ka gets into the hotel room of her potential victim {{early in the morning}} and begins to steal his valuables. If the lodger all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> awakes, <b>she</b> would pretend that she mistook the door, she was confused, but rarely departed empty-handed. For the benefit of the matter she could even spend a night with the rich cavalier, and then already quietly would clean his pockets. She had lots of other [...] "professional" [...] tricks that she used throughout her crime life, some of which are still used by thieves around the world today, more than 100 years later.|$|R
60|$|Britannia, sitting meditating {{one fine}} day (perhaps in the {{attitude}} {{in which she}} is presented on the copper coinage), discovers all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> that <b>she</b> wants Veneering in Parliament. It occurs to her that Veneering is 'a representative man'--which cannot in these times be doubted--and that Her Majesty's faithful Commons are incomplete without him. So, Britannia mentions to <b>a</b> legal gentleman <b>of</b> her acquaintance that if Veneering will 'put down' five thousand pounds, he may write <b>a</b> couple <b>of</b> initial letters after his name at the extremely cheap rate of two thousand five hundred per letter. It is clearly understood between Britannia and the legal gentleman that nobody is {{to take up the}} five thousand pounds, but that being put down they will disappear by magical conjuration and enchantment.|$|R
6000|$|He sang other songs--tunes {{not worthy}} of him--but ended with a ballad called [...] "Fair Springtide," [...] by MacDowell--a song so stern, so strange, so inexorably sad that the singer himself grew grave at last and rose to his best. Bertha was thrilled to the heart, saddened yet exalted by his voice. Her horizon--her {{emotional}} horizon--was <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> extended, and <b>she</b> caught glimpses of strange lands and dim peaks of fabled mountains; and when the singer declared himself at an end she sat benumbed while the others cheered--her hands folded on her lap. It seemed a profanation to applaud.|$|R
