5|$|Although often {{assumed to}} be a debate of recent origins, local Washington, D.C. {{newspapers}} have published news items on the controversy many times since at least 1971, all in response to Native American individuals or organizations asking for the name to be changed.

There was a protest of about 2,000 people at the 1992 Super Bowl between the Redskins and the Buffalo Bills; the American Indian Movement's (AIM) Vernon Bellecourt {{was one of the main}} <b>organizers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protest.|$|E

5|$|Astana was {{at first}} not invited to the Giro. Six days before the race began, RCS Sport (the <b>organizers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Giro) went back on the {{decision}} to exclude Astana and extended them a late invitation. This change of heart was at least partly contingent on Contador, Leipheimer, and Klöden participating in the race. Having thought for two months prior {{that they would not}} compete in the Giro, most of Astana's riders had planned to take a break during the Tour of Italy, and Contador was actually vacationing on a beach when Bruyneel called him to tell him the team was headed to the Giro.|$|E

5|$|In August 1915, Spinks {{was tapped}} {{to join a}} consultative panel of notable players and major billiard hall proprietors to help develop a new handicapping system for balkline billiards, {{organized}} by the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company, {{at that time the}} <b>organizers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World Championships. The inspiration for the new system was simply making it possible for the newly ascendant Willie Hoppe to be meaningfully challenged – his near-unassailability was hurting billiard tournament revenues, because the outcome was considered foreordained by many potential ticket-buyers. The system was expected {{to level the playing field}} in other ways, especially making it easier for skilled amateurs to enter the professional ranks.|$|E

5|$|Andrei Rublev {{was invited}} to the Cannes Film Festival in 1967 {{as part of a}} planned {{retrospective}} of Soviet film on occasion of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution.

A second invitation was made by the <b>organizers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cannes Film Festival in 1969. Soviet officials accepted this invitation, but they only allowed the film to screen at the festival out of competition, and it was screened just once at 4 A.M. {{on the final day of}} the festival. Audience response nevertheless was enthusiastic, and the film won the FIPRESCI prize. Soviet officials tried to prevent the official release of the film in France and other countries, but were not successful as the French distributor had legally acquired the rights in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Kamo, {{none of the}} <b>organizers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robbery {{were ever}} brought to trial, and {{initially}} {{it was not clear}} who was behind the raid, but after the arrest of Kamo, Litvinov and others, the Bolshevik involvement became obvious. The Mensheviks felt betrayed and angry; the robbery proved that the Bolshevik Centre operated independently from the unified Central Committee and was taking actions explicitly prohibited by the party congress. The leader of the Mensheviks, Georgi Plekhanov, called for separation from the Bolsheviks. Plekhanov's colleague, Julius Martov, said the Bolshevik Centre was something between a secret factional central committee and a criminal gang. The Tiflis Committee of the party expelled Stalin and several members for the robbery. The party's investigations into Lenin's conduct were thwarted by the Bolsheviks.|$|E
