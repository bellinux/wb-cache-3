40|$|Therapeutic {{cannabis}} {{administration is}} increasingly used in Western countries {{due to its}} positive role in several pathologies. Dronabinol or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) pills, ethanolic cannabis tinctures, <b>oromucosal</b> <b>sprays</b> or table vaporizing devices are available but other cannabinoids forms can be used. Inspired by the illegal practice of dabbing of butane hashish oil (BHO), cannabinoids from cannabis were extracted with butane gas, and the resulting concentrate (BHO) was atomized with specific vaporizing devices. The efficiency of "cannavaping," defined as the "vaping" of liquid refills for e-cigarettes enriched with cannabinoids, including BHO, was studied as an alternative route of administration for therapeutic cannabinoids. The results showed that illegal cannavaping would be subjected to marginal development due to the poor solubility of BHO in commercial liquid refills (especially those with high glycerin content). This prevents the manufacture of liquid refills with high BHO concentrations adopted by most recreational users of cannabis to feel the psychoactive effects more rapidly and extensively. Conversely, "therapeutic cannavaping" could be an efficient route for cannabinoids administration because less concentrated cannabinoids-enriched liquid refills are required. However, the electronic device marketed for therapeutic cannavaping should be carefully designed to minimize potential overheating and contaminant generation...|$|R

40|$|Background: Individuals with {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS) spasticity present {{with a range}} of symptoms and disability levels that are frequently challenging to manage. Summary: Clinical case reviews in treatment-resistant MS spasticity were presented in five country-specific sessions conducted in parallel at the MS Experts Summit. Attendees at the Norwegian session discussed early response to new treatments for severe spasticity and highlighted the importance of titrating THC:CBD <b>oromucosal</b> <b>spray</b> (Sativex ®) when adding it to baclofen. The French group focussed on MS symptoms and patient characteristics that interact with spasticity and agreed on a list of minimum ratings for diagnosis of MS spasticity symptoms. Attendees at the Spanish session concurred that THC:CBD <b>oromucosal</b> <b>spray</b> is effective and well tolerated as add-on therapy in treatment-resistant MS spasticity, particularly for pain, spasms and gait disturbances. The Italian group discussed the use of add-on THC:CBD <b>oromucosal</b> <b>spray</b> and other possible combination therapies for treatment-resistant MS spasticity. Attendees at the German session highlighted the need to address trigger factors for MS spasticity to reduce the potential for impact on activities of daily living (ADL) and quality of life (QoL). Three innovative studies of MS spasticity from the poster session were selected for closer review. The MOVE 1 EU epidemiological study indicated that, across western Europe, patients with MS spasticity continue to have unmet management needs. A literature review demonstrated that symptomatic relief of MS spasticity in patients who respond to THC:CBD <b>oromucosal</b> <b>spray</b> translates into sustainable improvements in ADL and QoL. Enriched-design studies of medications targeting the endocannabinoid system require careful interpretation due to possible pharmacodynamic 'priming', i. e. carry-over effects of successful active treatment during the enrichment phase.

40|$|Rationale Cognitive {{symptoms}} {{have increasingly}} {{been recognized as}} an important target {{in the development of}} future treatment strategies in schizophrenia. The nicotinergic neurotransmission system has been suggested as a potentially interesting treatment target for these cognitive deficits. However, previous research yielded conflicting results, which may be explained by several methodological limitations, such as the failure to include both a group of smoking and non-smoking schizophrenic patients, the use of only a single nicotine dose, and the inclusion of a very limited cognitive battery. Objectives The present study aims at investigating the cognitive effects of nicotine in schizophrenia while addressing these methodological issues. Methods In a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized crossover design, cognitive effects are assessed in smoking (n[*]=[*] 16) and non-smoking (n[*]=[*] 16) schizophrenic patients after receiving active (1 or 2 mg) or placebo <b>oromucosal</b> nicotine <b>spray.</b> Results A modest improving effect of nicotine on attention in the smoking but not the non-smoking group was found. No enhancing effects were found on measures of visual memory, working memory, processing speed, psychomotor speed, or social cognitive functioning in either patient group. Conclusions These findings suggest that the nicotinic receptor only has limited value as a cognitive treatment target in schizophrenia...|$|R
40|$|Schizophrenia {{patients}} {{are characterized by}} severe social impairments. Recently, social cognition has been put forward as an important mediator in schizophrenia between the often-reported neurocognitive deficits and functional outcome and is thus an important target for treatments. Nicotine {{has been reported to}} improve neurocognitive processes in schizophrenia patients but no studies have investigated possible nicotine-induced facilitation of social cognition. The current placebo-controlled crossover study aimed at bridging this gap by investigating whether the administration of active (1 mg or 2 mg) or placebo <b>oromucosal</b> nicotine <b>spray</b> resulted in improved social decision-making in non-smoking (N = 15) and smoking (N = 16) schizophrenia patients. All patients played the role of responder in a variant of the ultimatum game that allowed detailed measurements of fairness and intentionality considerations. The results showed impaired social decision-making in the non-smoking patients under placebo, but not in the smoking patients. Interestingly, this impairment normalized after administration of 1 mg of nicotine, but not after 2 mg of nicotine. Nicotine had no effect on performance in the smoking patients. The present study indicates that nicotine improves social decision-making in non-smoking patients. The present results suggest that acute nicotine effects may result in a facilitation of proactive control through improved attentional processes. However, the efficacy seems limited and although nicotine may thus be an interesting target for (social) cognitive enhancement in the subset of patients that do not smoke, more research is needed on the long-lasting effects of nicotine-based treatments...|$|R

40|$|Background: The prospective, non-interventional Mobility Improvement (MOVE) 2 {{study was}} {{designed}} to provide real life data on clinical outcomes of patients with treatment-resistant multiple sclerosis (MS) spasticity receiving routine treatment with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) :cannabidiol (CBD) <b>oromucosal</b> <b>spray</b> (Sativex®), subsequent to its approval in European countries. Methods: This interim analysis reports on MOVE 2 patients from Italy. Results: Interim data from 322 patients (58. 3 % female; mean age 51. 1 ± 10. 2 years) were analyzed. From baseline to month 3 of treatment (Visit 3), the mean 0 - 10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score decreased by - 19. 1 % (- 1. 6 points, p < 0. 0001) and the mean modified Ashworth score decreased from 2. 6 to 2. 3 points (p < 0. 0001). At Visit 3, 24. 6 % of 203 patients with available data were clinically relevant responders (≥ 30 % improvement from baseline NRS score; p < 0. 001 vs. baseline). The mean reported dose of THC:CBD <b>oromucosal</b> <b>spray</b> was 6. 1 ± 2. 5 sprays/day at Visit 1 (1 month) and 5. 1 ± 2. 6 sprays/day at Visit 3 (range 1 - 12 sprays/day at both timepoints).

40|$|The {{complexity}} of the endocannabinoid (eCB) system is becoming better understood and new drivers of eCB signaling are emerging. Modulation of {{the activities of the}} eCB system can be therapeutic in a number of diseases. Research into the eCB system has been paralleled by the development of agents that interact with cannabinoid receptors. In this regard it should be remembered that herbal cannabis contains a myriad of active ingredients, and the individual cannabinoids have quite distinct biological activities requiring independent studies.

40|$|Spasticity {{arises from}} {{hyperexcitability}} of the neural stretch reflex arc secondary to injury of the corticospinal tract. In response to injury, {{the density of}} glutamatergic inputs from afferent 1 A fibers to motor neurons increases dramatically and adaptive changes occur in the morphology of microglia cells in the spinal cord. SUMMARY: Involvement of the endocannabinoid system in pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for spasticity has been demonstrated in animal models of MS. Stimulation of cannabinoid (CB) 1 receptors reduces the hyperglutamatergic drive from sensory afferents to spinal cord motor neurons and blocks the synaptic effects of activated microglia and pro-inflammatory mediators (e. g. TNF-α) on glutamatergic transmission. Enhancing corticospinal tract excitability through intermittent theta burst stimulation inhibits the stretch reflex and spasticity by promoting long-term potentiation, a form of synaptic plasticity that requires stimulation of CB 1 receptors. Evidence indicates that the antispasticity effects of THC:CBD <b>oromucosal</b> <b>spray</b> (Sativex®) are associated with enhanced cortical long-term potentiation. Key Messages: Glutamatergic and GABAergic pathways {{are involved in the}} regulation of muscle tone. CB 1 receptors, which are associated with movement, postural control, and pain and sensory perception, influence glutamatergic pathways. THC:CBD <b>oromucosal</b> <b>spray</b> was shown to reverse motor cortex plasticity from long-term depression through long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission, thereby restoring, at least in part, effective corticospinal inputs to spinal circuits...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{observational}} study {{was to assess the}} efficacy of a tetrahydrocannabinol-cannabidiol (THC: CBD) <b>oromucosal</b> <b>spray</b> on spasticity using the stretch reflex in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Numeric rating scale (NRS) for spasticity, modified Ashworth scale (MAS), and the stretch reflex were assessed before and during treatment in 57 MS patients with spasticity eligible for THC: CBD treatment. A significant reduction in stretch reflex amplitude as well as significant reductions of NRS and MAS scores were observed. There was a low concordance between the three measures (stretch reflex, NRS, and MAS), likely related to the different aspects of muscle hypertonia assessed. Stretch reflex responders were taking a significantly higher number of puffs, whereas no differences were found in the responders by the other scales, suggesting that a higher dosage would add benefit if tolerated. The present study confirms the efficacy of cannabinoids in reducing spasticity in patients with MS, suggesting a higher sensitivity and specificity of the stretch reflex compared with other measures. As an objective and quantitative measure of spasticity, the stretch reflex is particularly useful to assess the effects of cannabinoids on spinal excitability and {{may play a role in}} future pharmacological studies...|$|E
40|$|Sativex is an {{emergent}} treatment {{option for}} spasticity in patients affected by multiple sclerosis (MS). This <b>oromucosal</b> <b>spray,</b> {{acting as a}} partial agonist at cannabinoid receptors, may modulate the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, leading to muscle relaxation that is in turn responsible for spasticity improvement. Nevertheless, since the clinical assessment may not be sensitive enough to detect spasticity changes, other more objective tools should be tested to better define the real drug effect. The aim of our {{study was to investigate}} the role of Sativex in improving spasticity and related symptomatology in MS patients by means of an extensive neurophysiological assessment of sensory-motor circuits. To this end, 30 MS patients underwent a complete clinical and neurophysiological examination, including the following electrophysiological parameters: motor threshold, motor evoked potentials amplitude, intracortical excitability, sensory-motor integration, and Hmax/Mmax ratio. The same assessment was applied before and after one month of continuous treatment. Our data showed an increase of intracortical inhibition, a significant reduction of spinal excitability, and an improvement in spasticity and associated symptoms. Thus, we can speculate that Sativex could be effective in reducing spasticity by means of a double effect on intracortical and spinal excitability...|$|E

40|$|Regulatory {{authorities}} admit {{clinical studies}} {{with an initial}} enrichment phase to select patients that respond to treatment before randomization (Enriched Design Studies; EDSs). The trial period aims to prevent long-term drug exposure risks in patients with limited chances of improvement while optimizing costs. In EDSs for symptom control therapies providing early improvements and without a wash-out period, {{it is difficult to}} show further improvements and thus large therapeutic gains versus placebo. Moreover, in trials with cannabinoids, the therapeutic gains can be further biased in the postenrichment randomized phase because of carryover and other effects. The aims of the present review article are to examine the placebo effects in the enrichment and postenrichment phases of an EDS with Δ(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol (THC/CBD) <b>oromucosal</b> <b>spray</b> in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) spasticity and to discuss the possible causes of maintained efficacy after randomization in the placebo-allocated patients. The overall mean therapeutic gain of THC/CBD spray over placebo in resistant MS spasticity after 16 weeks can be estimated as a ~ 1. 27 -point improvement on the spasticity 0 - 10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS; ~- 20. 1 % of the baseline NRS score).

40|$|Although {{clinical}} {{studies show that}} cannabinoids improve central pain in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) neurophysiological studies are lacking to investigate whether they also suppress these patients' electrophysiological responses to noxious stimulation. The flexion reflex (FR) in humans is a widely used technique for assessing the pain threshold and for studying spinal and supraspinal pain pathways and the neurotransmitter system involved in pain control. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study we investigated cannabinoid-induced changes in RIII reflex variables (threshold, latency and area) {{in a group of}} 18 patients with secondary progressive MS. To investigate whether cannabinoids act indirectly on the nociceptive reflex by modulating lower motoneuron excitability we also evaluated the H-reflex size after tibial nerve stimulation and calculated the H wave/M wave (H/M) ratio. Of the 18 patients recruited and randomized 17 completed the study. After patients used a commercial delta- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol mixture as an <b>oromucosal</b> <b>spray</b> the RIII reflex threshold increased and RIII reflex area decreased. The visual analogue scale score for pain also decreased, though not significantly. Conversely, the H/M ratio measured before patients received cannabinoids remained unchanged after therapy.

40|$|CONTEXT: Chronic pain in {{patients}} with advanced cancer poses a serious clinical challenge. The Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) /cannabidiol (CBD) <b>oromucosal</b> <b>spray</b> (U. S. Adopted Name, nabiximols; Sativex(®)) is a novel cannabinoid formulation currently undergoing investigation as an adjuvant therapy for this treatment group. OBJECTIVES: This follow-up study investigated the long-term safety and tolerability of THC/CBD spray and THC spray in relieving pain {{in patients}} with advanced cancer. METHODS: In total, 43 patients with cancer-related pain experiencing inadequate analgesia despite chronic opioid dosing, {{who had participated in}} a previous three-arm (THC/CBD spray, THC spray, or placebo), two week parent randomized controlled trial, entered this open-label, multicenter, follow-up study. Patients self-titrated THC/CBD spray (n= 39) or THC spray (n= 4) to symptom relief or maximum dose and were regularly reviewed for safety, tolerability, and evidence of clinical benefit. RESULTS: The efficacy end point of change from baseline in mean Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form scores for "pain severity" and "worst pain" domains showed a decrease (i. e. improvement) at each visit in the THC/CBD spray patients. Similarly, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C 30 scores showed a decrease (i. e. improvement) from baseline in the domains of insomnia, pain, and fatigue. No new safety concerns associated with the extended use of THC/CBD spray arose from this study. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the long-term use of THC/CBD spray was generally well tolerated, with no evidence of a loss of effect for the relief of cancer-related pain with long-term use. Furthermore, patients who kept using the study medication did not seek to increase their dose of this or other pain-relieving medication over time, suggesting that the adjuvant use of cannabinoids in cancer-related pain could provide useful benefit.
