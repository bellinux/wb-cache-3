The Bosphorus and the Dardanelles owe their existence to the fault lines running through Turkey that {{led to the creation of}} the Black Sea. The North Anatolian Fault Line runs across the north of the country from west to east, along which major earthquakes took place in history. The latest <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>big</b> earthquakes was the 1999 İzmit earthquake.|$|E

500|$|... "Margaritaville" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-founder Trey Parker. It first aired on March 25, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central. Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone said they had long planned to do an episode about the global recession, and they argued over whether to start the season with an episode about the economy, or [...] "The Ring," [...] an episode mocking the Jonas Brothers, a boy band which had recently grown in popularity. Stone argued the season premiere should focus on the economy because it was the biggest news item at the time, but Parker felt they needed more time to craft the script, and that the Jonas Brothers would be a funny season opener. Stone ultimately agreed, and later admitted it was the right decision. During an interview {{a few weeks before the}} episode aired, Stone said, [...] "That's one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>big</b> things we want to get right. We'll be talking about what kind of social commentary we want to make and do it right." ...|$|E

5000|$|The ambitious {{quality of}} the album's content was {{representative}} of the band's desire to [...] "do whatever we wanted," [...] according to Urie. The band was heavily inspired by music groups Third Eye Blind, Counting Crows, Arcade Fire and the Decemberists during rehearsals, and also by Danny Elfman and Jon Brion film scores. Urie specifically cited the Beatles, Queen, the Smiths, Name Taken, and the Keane song [...] "Everybody's Changing" [...] as influences on the album.

500|$|... "Everybody's Fool" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee, Ben Moody and David Hodges and {{produced}} by Dave Fortman. The Millennium Choir performed background vocals for the song. According to Lee, the song talks about celebrities who have completely false images. It has been misinterpreted as a message against Christian faith, due to the band's denial of being a Christian band. During an interview, Lee explained: [...] "My little sister was really getting into these, I don't want to offend anyone, but like really fake, cheesy, slutty female cracker-box idols, and it really pissed me off. She started dressing like them and she was like 8 years old. So I gave her the talk and I wrote a song." [...] She later revealed that the song was written for American pop singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera adding, [...] "At this point, everybody knows that Britney is fake. The song is not about Britney Spears; it's {{about a lot of}} people in this industry. It's so fake, the whole Hollywood thing. 'Look at how perfect I am!' Nobody looks like that. It's all fake and it's really hurting a lot of girls' and women's self images. Where are all the normal people?". According to the sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing at the website Musicnotes.com, [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] is written in the key of F major. It is set in a time signature of common time and performed in a tempo of 92 beats per minute. Lee's vocals in the song range from the note of A3 to the note of D5. After the third single from Fallen, [...] "My Immortal" [...] continued to grow successfully, Lee revealed that [...] "Imaginary" [...] would become the band's next and final single from the album stating, [...] "I think it's very epic. It's one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>big</b> Aerosmith or Black Sabbath kind of songs. It's like an opus, with the choir and the rock and the programming. I love that song." [...] However, the release of [...] "Imaginary" [...] was scrapped and [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] was released as the fourth single from Fallen on June 4, 2004, while a maxi single was released on April 28, 2004.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} and interprets the conceptions of pat, neopaganism, Russia, language and philosophy {{in the works}} of contemporary Russian philosopher Fedor Girenok and shows Girenok/ s position {{in the context of the}} Russian philosophy and shortly also in the context of European philosophy. Girenok/s analysis of pat and neopaganism bring the critique of the euroamerican civilization, mainly of its rationalism and relativism. Girenok finds the alternative to the European values in deliberate effort to resist the consequences of the world globalization, in attaching to the tradition, in staying in long term at the constant place (cultivating home), in cautious relation to the language and finaUy in protecting the space for experiencing experience. This position, as Girenok believes, is reminded by Russian philosophy and it is this position that can open (through fuUy experiencing the experience) the way to the authentic human live. FuUy experiencing the experience involves the ability of quietening the own voice, it means the ability of listening, which is also the key moment of realizing one/s position in bigger wholes, the key moment of understanding human being as the part <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>bigger</b> wholes.

60|$|Now, {{no doubt}} Mr. Jerome is writing with {{emphasis}} here. But {{there is sufficient}} truth in the passage for it to stand here as a rough symbol of another factor in this question. John Smithism, that manly and individualist element in the citizen, stands over against and resists all the forces of organisation that would subjugate it to a collective purpose. It is careless of coming national cessation and depopulation, careless of the insurgent spirit beneath the acquiescences of Mrs. Smith, careless of its own inevitable defeat in the economic struggle, careless because it can understand none of these things; it is obstinately muddle-headed, asserting what it conceives to be itself against the universe and all other John Smiths whatsoever. It is a factor with all other factors. The creative, acquisitive, aggressive spirit <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>bigger</b> John Smiths who succeed as against the myriads of John Smiths who fail, the wider horizons and more efficient methods of the educated man, the awakening class-consciousness of women, the inevitable futility of John Smithism, the sturdy independence that makes John Smith resent even disciplined co-operation with Tom Brown to achieve a common end, his essential incapacity, indeed, for collective action; {{all these things are}} against the ultimate triumph, and make for the ultimate civilisation even of John Smith.|$|R
