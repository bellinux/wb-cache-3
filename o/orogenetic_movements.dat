40|$|In {{the central}} thrust sheets of the Inner Magura Flysch, the {{magnetic}} fabric is relatively strongly affected by ductile defor-mation {{represented by a}} combination of simple shear and lateral shortening, probably associated with creation and motion of the thrust sheets driven by a push from the rear side. The ductile de-formation is generally stronger in the frontal areas of the indivi-dual thrust sheets than in their central areas. The Krosno lithofacies, mostly occurring in the Outer Krosno [...] Menilite Flysch, represents the youngest synorogenic flysch se-diments largely terminating the last depositional history in the Flysch Belt, embracing the interval from the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene. The deposition of this flysch lithofacies replaced the euxinic sedimentation of underlying Menilite Formation. This change in deposition was connected with Neoalpine <b>orogenetic</b> <b>movements</b> during the Oligocene, which evoked the fundamental re-arrangement of the orogenic belt. In terms of plate tectonics...|$|E
40|$|IN THIS WORK IT IS STUDIED THE PRESENCE OF POSSIBLE OIL SOURCE ROCKS IN THE IONIAN ZONE, THE PREAPOULIAN AND THE GAVROVO ZONES, THE DEPOSITION IN RELATION TO THE PALEOGEOGRAPHIC EVOLUTION OF THE FORMATIONS, THE ORGANIC MATTER MATURITY AND THE TIMING OF OIL GENERATION, AS WELL AS THE ORIGIN OF THE OIL SHOWS IN THE WESTERN GREECE. GEOCHEMICAL METHODS ARE APPLIED FOR THE DETERMINATIONS, AS ROCK EVAL PYROLYSIS, MICROSCOPIC DETERMINATION OF THE VITRINITE REFLECTANCE (RO), EXTRACTION-HYDROCARBON SEPARATION, GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY OF SATURATED HYDROCARBONS, BIOMARKERS AND CARBON 'ISOTOPES' DETERMINATION, AND BASIN MODELS FOR MATURITY DETERMINATION. FROM THE STUDY 5 SOURCE ROCK HORIZONS ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE ALPINE FORMATIONS OF IONIAN ZONE. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ARE THE TRIASSIC SHALES, THE LOWER POSIDONIA BEDS (TROARCIAN-AALENIAN) AND THE VIGLA SHALES (CENOMANIAN-TURONIAN). ONE SOURCE HORIZON THERE IS UPPER JURASSIC OF PREAPOYLIAN, WHILE IN GAVROVO NO SOURCE ROCKS ARE FOUND. THE ORGANIC MATTER MATURATION IS LOCATED IN GREAT DEPTHS, ESPECIALLY IN THE CENTRAL PARTS ÎŸF THE BASINS, DUE TO LOW GEOTHERMAL GRADIENTS. AS A RESULT,RELATIVELY LOW OIL QUANTITIES ARE GENERATED IN SOME BASINS, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT FAVORS THE OIL PRESERVATION IN REASONABLE DEPTHS UNDER THE EVAPORITES. THE OIL GENERATION FOR THE MAIN SOURCE ROCK HORIZONS BEGINS AFTER THE <b>OROGENETIC</b> <b>MOVEMENTS</b> AND FAVORS THE MIGRATION- ACCUMULATION OF THE OIL. THE WESTERN GREECE OIL SHOWS ARE CLASSIFIED IN 5 GROUPS AND THEIR SOURCE ROCK HORIZONS ARE AS FOLLOWS:OIL GROUP A :LOWER POSIDONIA BEDS, B:VIGLA SHALES, C: TRIASSIC SHALES, D:POSSIBLE OIL SOURCE OF...|$|E
