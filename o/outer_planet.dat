5|$|Astrometric {{observations}} {{made with}} the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that the <b>outer</b> <b>planet</b> 55 Cancri d is inclined at 53° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. The inner planets b and e are inclined at 85°. The inclination of f is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Even {{when this}} inner planet, {{with a mass}} at least 78% times that of Jupiter was {{accounted}} for, the star still showed a drift in its radial velocity. This {{eventually led to the}} discovery of the <b>outer</b> <b>planet</b> 55 Cancri d in 2002.|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to discover the planet is that only a lower limit on the mass can be obtained. Further astrometric observations with the Hubble Space Telescope on the <b>outer</b> <b>planet</b> 55 Cancri d suggest that planet is inclined at 53° to {{the plane of the}} sky; but innermost b and e are inclined at 85°. Planet c's inclination is unknown.|$|E
50|$|Project LONGSTOP (Long-term Gravitational Study of the <b>Outer</b> <b>Planets)</b> was a 1982 {{international}} {{consortium of}} Solar System dynamicists led by Archie Roy. It involved {{creation of a}} model on a supercomputer, integrating the orbits of (only) the <b>outer</b> <b>planets.</b> Its results revealed several curious exchanges of energy between the <b>outer</b> <b>planets,</b> but no signs of gross instability.|$|R

50|$|The Ravigneaux set has two sun gears, a large sun {{and a small}} sun, and {{a single}} planet carrier, holding two sets of {{planetary}} gears, inner <b>planets</b> and <b>outer</b> <b>planets.</b> The carrier is one sub-assembly but has two radii to couple with the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>planets,</b> respectively. The two sets of planet gears rotate independently of the carrier but co-rotate with a fixed gear ratio with respect to each other. The inner planets couple with the small sun gear and co-rotate at a fixed gear ratio with respect to it. The <b>outer</b> <b>planets</b> couple with the large sun gear and co-rotates with a fixed gear ratio with respect to it. Finally, the ring gear also couples and co-rotates with the <b>outer</b> <b>planets</b> in a fixed gear ratio with respect to them.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Jupiter Europa Orbiter led by NASA and the Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter {{led by the}} ESA were {{proposed}} together as an <b>Outer</b> <b>Planet</b> Flagship Mission to Jupiter's icy moons called Europa Jupiter System Mission, with a planned launch in 2020. In 2009 it was given priority over Titan Saturn System Mission. At that time, there was competition from other proposals. Japan proposed Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of discovery, Gliese 876 was already known to host an extrasolar planet {{designated}} Gliese 876 b. In 2001, further analysis of the star's radial velocity revealed {{the existence of a}} second planet in the system, which was designated Gliese 876 c. The orbital period of Gliese 876 c was found to be exactly half that of the <b>outer</b> <b>planet,</b> which meant that the radial velocity signature of the second planet was initially interpreted as a higher eccentricity of the orbit of Gliese 876 b.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 b is in a 1:2:4 Laplace {{resonance}} {{with the}} inner planet Gliese 876 c and the <b>outer</b> <b>planet</b> Gliese 876 e: {{in the time}} it takes planet e to complete one orbit, planet b completes two and planet c completes four. This is the second known example of a Laplace resonance, the first being Jupiter's moons Io, Europa and Ganymede. As a result, the orbital elements of the planets change fairly rapidly as they dynamically interact with one another. The planet's orbit has a low eccentricity, similar to the planets in the Solar System. The semimajor axis of the orbit is only 0.208 AU, less than that of Mercury in the Solar System. However Gliese 876 is such a faint star that this puts it in the outer part of the habitable zone.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} of magnetic field investigations on missions to the <b>outer</b> <b>planets</b> {{were defined as}} well as an instrumentation system, a program of studies and instrument development tasks was proposed for the mission definition phase of the <b>Outer</b> <b>Planets</b> Grand Tour project. A report on the status of this program is given. Requirements were also established for the spacecraft and the mission which would insure their compatibility with the magnetic field investigation proposed for the <b>outer</b> <b>planets</b> missions and developed figures of merit for encounter trajectories. The spacecraft-instrumentation interface and the on-board data handling system were defined in various reports by the Project Team and in the reports by the Science Steering Group. The defining program for exploring the <b>outer</b> <b>planets</b> within the more restrictive constraints of the Mariner Jupiter-Saturn project included defining a limited magnetic field investigation...|$|R
5|$|The first scientifically useful {{observation}} of Neptune from ground-based telescopes using adaptive optics, was commenced in 1997 from Hawaii. Neptune is currently entering its {{spring and summer}} season and {{has been shown to}} be heating up, with increased atmospheric activity and brightness as a consequence. Combined with technological advancements, ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics are recording increasingly more detailed images of it. Both Hubble and the adaptive-optics telescopes on Earth have made many new discoveries within the Solar System since the mid-1990s, with a large increase in the number of known satellites and moons around the <b>outer</b> <b>planet,</b> among others. In 2004 and 2005, five new small satellites of Neptune with diameters between 38 and 61 kilometres were discovered.|$|E
5|$|Astrometric {{observations}} {{with the}} Hubble Space Telescope measured an inclination of 53° of the <b>outer</b> <b>planet</b> d, though this result {{relies on the}} precise orbital parameters which have been substantially revised since this was published. The observed transits of e suggest an orbit normal inclined within 9° to the line-of-light, and a possible detection of the transit of an extended atmosphere around 55 Cancri b would, if confirmed, imply that it too is in an orbit that is close to edge-on. Between them, no measurement of c's nor f's inclination has been made. It had been thought that with five planets, the system cannot deviate far from coplanar {{in order to maintain}} stability. An attempt to measure the spin-orbit misalignment of the innermost planet reported that it was in a nearly polar orbit, but this interpretation of the data has since been challenged by a subsequent study, with noted inconsistencies between the implied and measured stellar rotation.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{now widely}} {{accepted}} that the Solar System was initially more compact {{and that the}} <b>outer</b> <b>planets</b> migrated outward to their current positions. The planetesimal-driven migration of the <b>outer</b> <b>planets</b> was first described in 1984 by Fernandez and Ip. This process {{is driven by the}} exchange of angular momentum between the planets and planetesimals originating from an outer disk. [...] Early dynamical models assumed that this migration was smooth. In addition to reproducing the current positions of the <b>outer</b> <b>planets,</b> these models offered explanations for: the populations of resonant objects in the Kuiper belt, the eccentricity of Pluto's orbit, the inclinations of the hot classical Kuiper belt objects and the retention of a scattered disk, and the low mass of Kuiper belt and the location of its outer edge near the 2:1 resonance with Neptune. However, these models failed to reproduce the eccentricities of the <b>outer</b> <b>planets,</b> leaving them with very small eccentricities {{at the end of the}} migration.|$|R
25|$|NASA {{performed}} a study called HOPE (Revolutionary Concepts for Human <b>Outer</b> <b>Planet</b> Exploration) regarding the future {{exploration of the}} Solar System.

25|$|In the 26th century, {{humanity}} {{has left}} an overpopulated Earth to colonize a new solar system.

Consequently, a top Alliance agent known only as the Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is tasked with recapturing her.|$|E
25|$|Announced in 2008, the {{eclipsing binary}} system HW Virginis, {{comprising}} a subdwarf B star {{and a red}} dwarf, was claimed to also host a planetary system.

The proposed <b>outer</b> <b>planet</b> is sufficiently massive {{that it may be}} considered to be a brown dwarf under some definitions of the term, but the discoverers claimed that the orbital configuration implies it would have formed like a planet from a circumbinary disc. Both planets may have accreted additional mass when the primary star lost material during its red giant phase.|$|E

25|$|The first {{modifications}} to the Nice model were the initial positions of the giant planets. Investigations {{of the behavior of}} planets orbiting in a gas disk using hydrodynamical models reveal that the giant planets would migrate toward the Sun. If the migration continued it would have resulted in Jupiter orbiting close to the Sun like recently discovered exoplanets known as hot Jupiters. Saturn's capture in a resonance with Jupiter prevents this, however, and the later capture of the other planets results in a quadruple resonant configuration with Jupiter and Saturn in their 3:2 resonance. A late instability beginning from this configuration is possible if the outer disk contains Pluto-massed objects. The gravitational stirring of the outer planetesimal disk by these Pluto-massed objects increases their eccentricities and also results in the inward migration of the giant planets. The quadruple resonance of the giant planets is broken when secular resonances are crossed during the inward migration. A late instability similar to the original Nice model then follows. Unlike the original Nice model the timing of this instability is not sensitive to the distance between the <b>outer</b> <b>planet</b> and the planetesimal disk. The combination of resonant planetary orbits and the late instability triggered by these long distant interactions has been referred to as the Nice 2 model.|$|E
500|$|Upsilon Andromedae d orbits {{its star}} nearly every 3.5 years (about 1,276 days) in an {{eccentric}} orbit, more eccentric {{than that of}} any of the known planets in the Solar System. To explain the planet's orbital eccentricity, some have proposed a close encounter with an now-lost <b>outer</b> <b>planet</b> of Upsilon Andromedae A.
