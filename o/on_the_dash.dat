5|$|The {{first officer}} was 31 {{years old and}} held a C-{{certificate}} which limited him to being first officer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dash</b> 7. The certificate was issued on 5 January 1987 and had been valid for the Dash 7 since 23 February 1988. He had started his flight training in 1977 and had completed it in the United States in 1979. He {{was hired as a}} pilot for Widerøe on 6 February 1986, where he had originally served on the de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter. He was checked out as first officer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dash</b> 7 in February 1988. He had a total flight time of 6,458 hours, of which 85 were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dash</b> 7. The flight attendant was 28 years old and had worked for Widerøe since 1983.|$|E
5|$|The Leaf's {{electric}} warning sound had to {{be removed}} for cars delivered in the U.K., as the country's law mandates that any hazard warning sound must be capable of being disabled between 11:00 pm and 6:00 am, and the Leaf's audible warning system does not allow for such temporary deactivation. For the 2014 UK model of the car, the VSP system is enabled by default, though a button <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dash</b> permits drivers to disable the system until the next time the car is switched on.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Renault {{launched}} the Clio Williams as a limited edition of 3,800 cars (1,300 {{more than they}} needed for homologation purposes) with each car bearing a numbered plaque <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dash.</b> These sold out so quickly that Renault ended up building 1,600 more.|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} of the new Ford Mustang Shelby GT-H {{is based on the}} standard Mustang GT. Only a few features sets the two models interior styling apart. They include “GT-H” logos on the headrests, customized sill plates featuring “Hertz Shelby GT-H” lettering and a numbered plaque <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dash.</b> The floor mats also feature “GT-H’ logos.|$|E
25|$|On the exterior, {{was a new}} 11-spoke wheel design, new fog lights, {{and smoked}} {{surrounding}} trim for the headlights and taillights. On the interior, a new 2-position memory function was added for the driver seat, a maintenance indicator light, automatic drive-away door locking system, a new storage compartment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dash</b> (for models without the navigation system) and new trim highlights.|$|E
25|$|In-field {{environmental}} data is still popular among some storm chasers, especially temperature, moisture, and wind speed and direction data. Many {{have chosen to}} mount weather stations atop their vehicles. Others use handheld anemometers. Rulers or baseballs may be brought along for measuring hail and for showing as a comparison object. Vehicle mounted cameras, such as on the roof or more commonly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dash,</b> provide continuous visual recording capability.|$|E

30|$|Figure  6 (bottom row) {{illustrates}} {{the distribution of}} the x- and y- component of the gradient for the off-axis vortex in Cartesian coordinates. Here, this distribution again exhibits lobes similar to Fig.  6 (top row). In the off-axis case, <b>the</b> <b>dashed</b> lines in <b>the</b> x- and y - gradient distribution are curved and not perpendicular to the zero lines. The gradient distribution exhibits no mirror symmetry. This represents the anisotropy and correlates with the results indicated in Fig.  5. The amount of the x-component of the gradient in Cartesian coordinates does not equal the azimuthal phase gradient <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dashed</b> line in this case, neither does <b>the</b> y-component <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other <b>dashed</b> line. This is owed to the fact of an off-axis vortex which requires a coordinate transformation for further investigation. Here, we concentrate on an qualitative considerations.|$|R

25|$|As an option, {{an active}} limited slip {{differential}} was available instead of the standard viscous LSD. This new unit locked the rear differential if it detected that traction was lost {{by one of the}} wheels. A light <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dash</b> also lit up if the LSD engaged. Active LSD came standard on all V-Spec R33 GT-R Skylines and was also available on some ECR33 GTS-25t models; these can be identified by the A-LSD and SLIP lights on the tachometer.|$|E
25|$|Inside, {{headrests}} {{were now}} standard equipment {{and a new}} instrument panel included square instruments replacing the round instruments of previous years along with a push-button operated ashtray and rotary glove compartment knob, as well as heating/air conditioning controls relocated {{from the center of}} the dash to the left of the steering wheel near the lights and wiper switches. The high-beam lights indicator was a red rocket located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dash.</b> Also new was a steering column-mounted ignition switch that also locked the steering wheel when not in use – a feature found on all 1969-model General Motors passenger cars, a year before locking steering columns were required by federal mandate starting in 1970.|$|E

2500|$|Innovations for 1937 {{included}} built-in defroster vents, safety type interior hardware (such as {{flexible door}} handles and recessed controls <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dash)</b> and seat back padding, and fully insulated engine mounts. Brakes were 13" [...] drums, then in 1939 they expanded to 14", but shrunk to 12" [...] drums in 1940. Front suspension was independent.|$|E
2500|$|In 2016, Norfolk Southern began a rebuild program <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dash</b> 9-40C units. The rebuild {{involved}} {{overhaul of}} the engine, emissions upgrades, a new cab (featuring GE Trip Optimizer, PTC, and NS Cab Signals / [...] Locomotive Speed Limiter), new electronics, DPU and ECP capabilities, increased weight, and an electric parking brake. Norfolk Southern plans on rebuilding all of the Dash 9-40Cs {{and some of the}} Dash 9-40CWs. The new locomotives are being classified as GE AC44C6M.|$|E

5000|$|A moritat (from mori meaning [...] "deadly" [...] and tat meaning [...] "deed") is {{a medieval}} {{version of the}} murder ballad {{performed}} by strolling minstrels. In The Threepenny Opera, the moritat singer with his street organ introduces and closes the drama with {{the tale of the}} deadly Mackie Messer, or Mack the Knife, a character based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dashing</b> highwayman Macheath in John Gay's The Beggar's Opera (who was in turn based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> historical thief Jack Sheppard). The Brecht-Weill version of the character was far more cruel and sinister, and has been transformed into a modern anti-hero.|$|R
2500|$|Interior {{lighting}} {{is available in}} a variety of form factors, ranging from flat LED panels under the sun visors, to halogen or strobe lights mounted on the rear deck, to ‘cherry’ or oscillating ‘teardrop’ lights mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dash.</b> These may be permanently mounted and wired into the vehicle’s electrical system, or they may be temporarily mounted and plug into the vehicle’s cigarette lighter. [...] They are often fitted with shields which direct the light through the window, but prevent reflections in to the cab.|$|E
2500|$|The 1954 Nash {{models were}} the first American {{automobiles}} to have a front-end, fully integrated heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning system. This was the first mass market system with controls <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dash</b> and an electrically-engaged clutch. This [...] "first true refrigerated air conditioner system" [...] for automobiles was also compact and easily serviceable {{with all of its}} components installed under the hood or in the cowl area. With a single thermostatic control, the Nash passenger compartment air cooling option was described as [...] "a good and remarkably inexpensive" [...] system.|$|E
2500|$|... 1985 models {{received}} minor updates while styling remained unchanged. The {{interior was}} updated for 1985, marking its most significant update since 1977. The simulated woodgrain appliqué used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dash</b> {{was replaced with}} a simulated silver metallic appliqué. The shaft-style radio was replaced with a more modern DIN-and-a-half style radio, while the pull-out headlight switch {{was replaced by a}} push button style switch. The climate controls were updated with rotary switches for the fan and rear window defroster replacing the toggle style switches. The instruments were updated to have a more modern appearance, with a horizontal speedometer while a round speedometer was included with the optional gauge package.|$|E
50|$|Open to three-year-olds {{willing to}} race six furlongs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dirt, <b>the</b> <b>Dash</b> is an {{ungraded}} stakes event but carries a purse of $250,000. This race {{is also known}} as <b>the</b> Ocala Stud <b>Dash</b> Stakes.|$|R

60|$|The races came next. Kintuck took first money <b>on</b> <b>the</b> straightaway <b>dash,</b> {{but lost}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> long race around the pole. It nearly broke his heart, {{but he came}} in second to Denver Dan's sorrel twice in succession.|$|R
2500|$|In August 1996 the retro-look Cervo C (for [...] "Classic") appeared, {{following}} {{the success of}} Subaru's Vivio Bistro and Mitsuoka's original Viewt. The Cervo C came as a well-equipped five-door with the [...] F6A engine (55PS in the automatic 4WD version). A high-powered AM/FM cassette stereo was standard, as were power windows and locks as well as wooden details <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dash</b> and steering wheel. Automatic transmission and/or four-wheel drive were optional. The metal bodywork {{was the same as}} on the Cervo Mode, but the front assembly was entirely different and chromed bumpers, mirrors and doorhandles added to the classic look. In May 1997 a three-door version joined the lineup. Production ended in October 1998, when the Cervo Mode sister model was discontinued. Also launched in India as the [...] "Zen Classic" [...] it was not well received, becoming a huge flop in the Indian market.|$|E
2500|$|The first Pontiac GTO was {{an option}} {{package for the}} Pontiac Tempest, {{available}} with the two-door coupe, hardtop, and convertible body styles. The US$295 package included a [...] V8 rated at [...] at 4800rpm with a single Carter AFB four-barrel carburetor and dual exhaust, chromed valve covers and air cleaner, seven-blade clutch fan, a floor-shifted three-speed manual transmission with Hurst shifter, stiffer springs, larger diameter front sway bar, wider wheels with 7.50 × 14 redline tires, hood scoops, and GTO badges. Optional equipment included a four-speed manual, Super Turbine 300 two-speed automatic transmission, more powerful [...] "Tri-Power" [...] carburetion (three two-barrel Rochester 2G carburetors) rated at , metallic drum brake linings, limited-slip differential, heavy-duty cooling, ride and handling package, and the usual array of power and convenience accessories.

2500|$|The 1948 Citroen 2CV was {{launched}} in France with a manual headlamp leveling system, controlled by the driver with a knob through a mechanical rod linkage. This allowed the driver to adjust the vertical aim of the headlamps {{to compensate for the}} passenger and cargo load in the vehicle. In 1954, Cibié introduced an automatic headlamp leveling system linked to the vehicle's suspension system to keep the headlamps correctly aimed regardless of vehicle load, without driver intervention. The first vehicle to be so equipped was the Panhard Dyna Z. Beginning in the 1970s, Germany and some other European countries began requiring remote-control headlamp leveling systems that permit the driver to lower the lamps' aim by means of a dashboard control lever or knob if the rear of the vehicle is weighted down with passengers or cargo, which would tend to raise the lamps' aim angle and create glare. Such systems typically use stepper motors at the headlamp and a rotary switch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dash</b> marked [...] "0", [...] "1", [...] "2", [...] "3" [...] for different beam heights, [...] "0" [...] being the [...] "normal" [...] (and highest) position for when the car is lightly loaded.|$|E
50|$|The car used a single-cylinder engine, and {{was based}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> curved <b>dash</b> Oldsmobile An unusual feature {{was the lack}} of brakes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wheels. To stop the car, the driver used the reverse pedal of the {{epicyclic}} transmission.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, Privett {{played for}} <b>the</b> Houston <b>Dash</b> {{as an amateur}} player. Privett made <b>the</b> Houston <b>Dash's</b> amateur squad after paying a $75 fee to attend an open tryout. After getting an {{invitation}} to attend <b>the</b> <b>Dash</b> pre-season, she cancelled her plans {{to try out for}} other squads and focused <b>on</b> making <b>the</b> <b>Dash.</b> Between injuries, trades, and the Women's World Cup, Privett became needed in the midfield and made her NWSL debut as a 58th minute substitute against FC Kansas City on May 2.|$|R
