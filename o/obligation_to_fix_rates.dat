40|$|In a three-stage game {{in which}} banks can obtain {{liquidity}} through open market operations, interbank transactions or standing facilities we compare the equilibrium outcomes of <b>fixed</b> and variable <b>rate</b> tenders in the primary market. We focus on bidding behavior, induced allotment ratios, functioning of the secondary market and resorting to standing facilities, under several scenarios, among which collateral shortage and credit rationing. It is shown that overbidding is inherent <b>to</b> the <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> auction, but can be very mitigated under a variable rate procedure. Due {{to the existence of}} a finite number of equilibria, variable rate tenders allow keeping the informational content of quantity bids, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> tenders. ...|$|R

50|$|In the UK variable-rate {{mortgages}} {{are more}} common than in the United States. This is in part because mortgage loan financing relies less on fixed income securitized assets (such as mortgage-backed securities) than in the United States, Denmark, and Germany, and more on retail savings deposits like Australia and Spain. Thus, lenders prefer variable-rate mortgages <b>to</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> ones and whole-of-term <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> mortgages are generally not available. Nevertheless, in recent years <b>fixing</b> the <b>rate</b> of the mortgage for short periods has become popular and the initial two, three, five and, occasionally, ten years of a mortgage can be <b>fixed.</b> From 2007 <b>to</b> the beginning of 2013 between 50% and 83% of new mortgages had initial periods fixed in this way.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{begins by}} {{reviewing}} {{the debate about}} exchange rate regimes in the transition countries of Eastern and Central Europe (CEECs), and suggests that prototypically such countries move through three stages: from <b>fixed</b> <b>rates</b> <b>to</b> flexible rates or, typically, managed floats, and then back <b>to</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>rates</b> again in preparation for adopting the euro. The paper then analyzes dilemmas associated with managed floats, or, more generally, “intermediate ” regimes. It then looks at de facto adoption of foreign currencies in CEECs (i. e. dollarization and euroization), and analyzes the incentives for unilateral adoption of the euro: that is, without endorsement by the EU. Finally, it explores some implications for the embryonic debate about “currency cooperation ” in East Asia...|$|R

5000|$|Capped rate - a {{variable}} interest rate, {{but there is}} also a guarantee that the interest rate will not rise above a stated maximum. In order to provide this, the lender would probably need to purchase a derivative contract to protect itself against market interest rates rising above the cap, and would need to pass the cost of this on to the borrower.
