5|$|The MSE {{derives from}} an {{approach}} to psychiatry known as descriptive psychopathology or descriptive phenomenology, which developed {{from the work of}} the philosopher and psychiatrist Karl Jaspers. From Jaspers' perspective it was assumed {{that the only way to}} comprehend a patient's experience is through his <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> description (through an approach of empathic and non-theoretical enquiry), as distinct from an interpretive or psychoanalytic approach which assumes the analyst might understand experiences or processes of which the patient is unaware, such as defense mechanisms or unconscious drives.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of her visions is {{problematic}} since {{the main source}} of information on this topic is the condemnation trial transcript in which she defied customary courtroom procedure about a witness' oath and specifically refused to answer every question about her visions. She complained that a standard witness oath would conflict with an oath she had previously sworn to maintain confidentiality about meetings with her king. It remains unknown to what extent the surviving record may represent the fabrications of corrupt court officials <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> possible fabrications to protect state secrets. Some historians sidestep speculation about the visions by asserting that her belief in her calling is more relevant than questions about the visions' ultimate origin.|$|E

A full meeting of the Privy Council was also held on 6 February 1811, when George, Prince of Wales was sworn in as Prince Regent by Act of Parliament. The current statutes regulating the establishment of a regency in the case of minority or incapacity of the sovereign also require any regents to swear their oaths before the Privy Council.|$|E
5|$|In 1823, a {{year after}} independence, slaves made up 29% of the {{population}} of Brazil, a figure which fell throughout the lifetime of the Empire: from 24% in 1854, to 15.2% in 1872, and finally to less than 5% in 1887—the year before slavery was completely abolished. Slaves were mostly adult males from southwestern Africa. Slaves brought to Brazil differed ethnically, religiously and linguistically, each identifying primarily with his <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> nation of origin, rather than by a shared African ethnicity. Some of the slaves brought to the Americas had been captured while fighting intertribal wars in Africa and had then been sold to slave dealers.|$|E
5|$|In September 2013, Steam {{introduced}} {{the ability to}} share most games with family members and close friends by authorizing machines to access one's library.

When the main player initiates a game while a shared account is using it, the shared account user is allowed {{a few minutes to}} either save their progress and close the game or purchase the game for his <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> account. Within Family View, introduced in January 2014, parents can adjust settings for their children's tied accounts, limiting the functionality and accessibility to the Steam client and purchased titles.|$|E

The sport originated in Southern California, USA, in the early 1980s but is now practiced in many places with several sanctioning organizations including the Single Action Shooting Society (SASS), Western Action Shootists Association (WASA), and National Congress of Old West Shooters (NCOWS), as well as others in the USA and in other countries. There are different categories shooters can compete in. There's the gunfighter, frontiersman, classic cowboy and duelist - each with its own specifications.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is played}} by first {{introducing}} the central character.

The central contestant also has a piece of baggage of his <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own,</b> which is only revealed {{at the end of}} the show.

5|$|In the Adventure Mode, the {{characters}} {{compete in a}} race for the Super Big Power Crystal. This race {{is made up of}} six stages, each containing smaller sub-maps.

5|$|In the Republic of India, a {{governor}} is the constitutional head {{of each of}} the twenty-nine states. The governor is appointed by the President of India for a term of five years, and holds office at the President's pleasure. The governor is de jure head of the state government; all its executive actions are taken in the governor's name. However, the governor must act on the advice of the popularly elected council of ministers, headed by the chief minister, who thus hold de facto executive authority at the state-level. The Constitution of India also empowers the governor to act upon his <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> discretion, such as the ability to appoint or dismiss a ministry, recommend President's rule, or reserve bills for the President's assent. Over the years, the exercise of these discretionary powers have given rise to conflict between the elected chief minister and the central government–appointed governor.|$|E
5|$|Mario & Sonic brings {{together}} the two title characters and fourteen more from both franchises {{to participate in}} environments based on the official venues of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. These environments are stylized to fit the futuristic and cartoon-like art styles of the Sonic and Mario franchises respectively. Each playable character has his <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> statistics which can serve as an advantage or disadvantage depending on the event. The characters are divided into four categories: all-around, speed, power, and skill. The Wii version has additional in-game characters taken from the console's Mii Channel, which allows the user to create a Mii, a customized avatar, that can be imported into games that support the feature. Both games have non-playable characters who serve as referees for particular events.|$|E
