Comparison {{with the}} <b>overall</b> Wiener <b>index,</b> a novel set of <b>overall</b> Wiener <b>indexes</b> (m RW, m RWp, m RWpc, and m RWc) were defined, which named the reduced <b>overall</b> Wiener <b>indexes.</b> The {{potential}} {{usefulness of the}} reduced <b>overall</b> Wiener <b>indexes</b> in QSAR/QSPR is evaluated by its correlation {{with a number of}} C 3 -C 8 alkanes and by a favorable comparison with models based on the <b>overall</b> Wiener <b>index</b> and molecular connectivity indexes. This can extend the usefulness of the Wiener number, and can make the Wiener number {{to be a kind of}} widely used topological index in practice. Method. The present communication attempts to correlate boiling point, surface tension, critical Temperature and critical pressures of 38 diverse functional acyclic compounds with the reduced <b>overall</b> Wiener <b>indices</b> and to compare those with relations of the <b>overall</b> Wiener <b>index</b> and molecular connectivity indices to explore the diagnostic Results. The results show that considerably better statistics is obtained when using the reduced <b>overall</b> Wiener <b>index.</b> The reduced <b>overall</b> Wiener <b>indexes</b> provided even the same statistical results as the molecular connectivity indexes in all models with five variables, and the standard deviations provided by these two sets of indexes are rather closed. Conclusions. Summarized the results, one may conclude that the reduced <b>overall</b> Wiener <b>index</b> examined shows a good potential for QSAR and QSPR studies. It denotes some information of molecular structure, and make up for the pitfalls of Wiener index. This can extend the usefulness of the Wiener number, and can make the Wiener number to be a kind of widely used topological index in practice...|$|R

For this purpose we use a procedure that we recently developed that guarantees a full profile of non-zero weights, or "multipliers.

Here we also utilize the flexibility of DEA by introducing bounds on the allowable values to reflect the views of coaches, trainers and other experts on the basketball team for which evaluations are being conducted. Finally we show how these combinations can be extended by taking account of team as well as individual considerations.

40|$|Biodiversity {{conservation}} strategies commonly target {{areas of}} high species richness and/or high endemism. However, {{the correlation between}} richness and endemism at scales relevant to conservation is unclear; these two common goals of conservation plans may therefore be in conflict. Here the spatial concordance between richness and endemism is tested using five taxa in North America: butterflies, birds, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles. This concordance is also tested using <b>overall</b> <b>indices</b> of richness and endemism (incorporating all five taxa). For all taxa except birds, richness and endemism were significantly correlated, with amphibians, reptiles, and the <b>overall</b> <b>indices</b> showing the highest correlations (rs = 0. 527 - 0. 676). However, 'priority sets' of ecoregions (i. e., the top 10 % of ecoregions) based on richness generally overlapped poorly with those based on endemism (< 50 % overlap for all but reptiles). These results offer only limited support for the idea that richness and endemism are correlated at broad scales and indicate that land managers will need to balance these dual, and often conflicting, goals of biodiversity conservation...|$|R
