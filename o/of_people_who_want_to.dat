25|$|If {{you could}} {{demonstrate}} that the BBC was grossly extravagant {{there might be a}} case for saying OK take it away. But in fact the BBC per minute in almost every category is as cheap as you can find anywhere in the world and produces the best quality. If you take the money away, which part of the BBC will you remove? The BBC has gone through swingeing staff cuts. It has been cut to the bone, if you divert licence fee money elsewhere, you cut quality and services. There is always that threat from politicians who will say your licence fee is up for grabs. We will take it. There is a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see the BBC weakened. They talk of this terrible tax of the licence fee. Yet it is the best bargain that is going. Four radio channels and god knows how many TV channels. It is piffling.|$|E
500|$|Meyer has {{dismissed}} such criticisms, arguing {{both that}} the books center around Bella's choice, which she perceives {{as the foundation}} of modern feminism, and that Bella's damsel in distress persona is due only to her humanity. Meyer also added, [...] "Just because [...] doesn't do kung fu and she cooks for her father doesn't make her worthy of that criticism". Shannon Simcox of The Daily Collegian has similarly dismissed the criticism surrounding Bella, commenting, [...] "While Bella plays the perfect damsel in distress that gets herself into sticky situations, she is also very in control of herself. She chose to move to Forks and be in a new place; she constantly faces a bunch <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> suck the life right out of her, and she is constantly pleading to become a vampire, too, so she can take care of herself and Edward." ...|$|E
500|$|The deal {{attracted}} mass {{attention from}} the media. Neil Harman, then of the Daily Mail, questioned the power broadcasters and Premier League chairman now had over fixture scheduling. He concluded his piece with a warning: [...] "The game has already reached saturation coverage, now {{it is likely to}} be choked. Football on six days out of seven per week will be good for no-one." [...] The Independent noted that this was a [...] "remarkable coup" [...] for BSkyB, given the company's fluctuating fortunes. The Guardian correspondent David Lacey suggested that fans were the biggest losers: [...] "A lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> watch matches regularly in future are going to have to buy a bond or a dish." [...] Bryan Davies, Baron Davies of Oldham described the arrangement as [...] "absolutely appalling" [...] and Football Supporters' Association chairman Craig Brewin criticised the [...] "obscene" [...] amounts of money clubs earned as part of the deal.|$|E

500|$|During {{the height}} of the Daddies' popularity, Perry found the band's {{mainstream}} notoriety was causing an alienating effect on his personal life, claiming it to have negatively changed his relationships with friends and even subjected him to occasional heckling from strangers who recognized him in public. He would later recall, [...] "It's a total cliché, but [...] doesn't make you happy. There's a lot missing. Success has given people the right to yell at me on the street, but I don't really feel like it's given me any dignity". Already feeling burnt out from the Daddies' constant touring, Perry's frustration was only exacerbated by the media's persistent dismissal of the Daddies as a retro novelty act, though he later claimed to have felt pressured to maintain the image due to audience and media expectations. When the band began to face criticism and accusations of selling out from their Northwest fanbase, the Daddies fought to further push themselves away from their mainstream typecasting: in a 1999 interview, responding to their place in the swing scene, Perry retorted [...] " [...] unapologetically play ska right in the face <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hear swing".|$|E
2500|$|In February 2009, Lauder and the WJC {{were highly}} {{critical}} of the Vatican’s decision to revoke the excommunication of Bishop Richard Williamson, {{a senior member of the}} dissident Catholic group Society of St. Pius X. Williamson, in an interview with Swedish television, had denied the existence of gas chambers in Nazi concentration camps. Lauder said: [...] "The Vatican was badly advised to revoke the excommunication of the four bishops...Therefore, we call on Pope Benedict XVI to urgently address these concerns and to ensure that the achievements of four decades of Catholic-Jewish dialogue are not being damaged by a small minority <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> divide rather than unite." [...] Lauder later praised Benedict XVI for writing a personal letter to Catholic bishops in which the Pope explained himself. [...] "The Pope has found clear and unequivocal words regarding Bishop Williamson's Holocaust denial, and he deserves praise for admitting that mistakes were made within the Vatican in the handling of this affair," [...] the WJC president was quoted as saying.|$|E

For Mick's announcement, Treadwell-Collins said: [...] "I'm so excited to have actors of Danny and Kellie's calibre joining what is an already strong and talented company of actors." [...] Dyer said at the time of the announcement, [...] "I am so excited about starting a new chapter in my career and cannot wait to become part of the East End family." [...] Later in the same month, Dyer said that becoming the new pub landlord was [...] "like the perfect marriage. To take over The Queen Vic on Christmas Day, to be on primetime TV on the BBC's flagship show... I want to show people what I can do." [...] Dyer said in the Daily Star that he was not nervous joining EastEnders, but that he was excited and [...] "can't wait for everyone to see me in the Vic", joking that he hoped his character would not have sex with Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace). The programme had suffered falling ratings in 2013, and Dyer told Inside Soap that he wanted to [...] "help turn EastEnders around". When asked by Heat if he would be [...] "the saviour" [...] of EastEnders, he said that he would, and said, [...] "a lot of people were excited about me going to EastEnders [...] there's a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see me fail", adding that it was a risk that [...] "could work or couldn't work". Controller of BBC One, Charlotte Moore, said in December 2013 that Dyer [...] "is an extraordinary presence on the set of EastEnders—it's very exciting. He's just a big, big character and bringing him into the Vic is going to change a lot of the dynamics of EastEnders". Shane Richie, who plays previous landlord Alfie Moon, said Mick and the rest of the Carters would [...] "change the dynamics of the Queen Vic", confirming that their arrival was [...] "the big Christmas storyline".|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Bellamy {{has many}} ingenious {{arrangements}} {{to meet the}} needs <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be singers or actors or writers,--in other words, who do not want to work. They may sing or act as much as they like, provided that enough other people will hand over enough of their food cards to keep them going. But if no one wants to hear them sing or see them act they may starve,--just as they do now. Here the author harks back unconsciously to his nineteenth century individualism; he need not have done so; other socialist writers would have it that one of the everlasting boards would [...] "sit on" [...] every aspiring actor or author before he was allowed to begin. But we may take it either way. It is not the major point. There is no need to discuss {{the question of how to}} deal with the artist under socialism. If the rest of it were all right, no one need worry about the artist. Perhaps he would do better without being remunerated at all. It is doubtful whether the huge commercial premium that greets success to-day does good or harm. But let it pass. It is immaterial to the present matter.|$|E
