40|$|The <b>ruddy</b> <b>duck</b> (<b>Oxyura</b> <b>jamaicensis)</b> was {{introduced}} to wildfowl collections in the United Kingdom (UK) in the 1940 s and subsequently escaped into the wild. Estimated numbers have increased rapidly in the UK from 20 wintering birds in 1962 to 5, 946 in January 2000.

40|$|Ducks nesting on {{seasonal}} and semi-permanent wetlands near Flagstaff, Arizona {{were studied}} during 1978, 1979, and 1980 to determine factors limiting {{the production of}} waterfowl.

40|$|Native to North America, <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> <b>Oxyura</b> <b>jamaicensis</b> now {{occur in}} 21 {{countries}} in the western Palaearctic (including Iceland) and their expanding population threatens the native white-headed duck, Oxyura leucocephala, through hybridization and possibly competition for food and nest sites. We used mitochondrial DNA sequences and nuclear microsatellites to test whether the European <b>ruddy</b> <b>duck</b> population is descended solely from the captive population in the UK, which traces to seven individuals imported from the USA in 1948, or, alternatively, has been augmented by natural dispersal of birds from North America. Limited genetic diversity in the European population {{is consistent with a}} founder population as small as seven birds. In addition, shifts in allele frequencies at several loci, presumably due to genetic drift in the founding population, result in significant differentiation between the European and North American populations. Despite the recent separation of these populations, almost all individuals could be unambiguously assigned based on their composite genotypes, to one of two distinct populations, one comprising all of the European <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> we sampled (including those from Iceland and captive birds in the UK) and the other comprising all North American samples.

40|$|The <b>ruddy</b> <b>duck</b> (<b>Oxyura</b> <b>jamaicensis),</b> a stifftail {{native to}} the Americas, was {{introduced}} to the UK in the 1950 s and has since been recorded in 22 western Palearctic countries. By 2000, the UK popu- lation peaked at nearly 6, 000 individuals. In 1991, hybridisation with the native and globally threatened (IUCN Endangered) white-headed duck (Oxyura leu- cocephala), a stifftail restricted to the Mediterranean and Asia, was recorded in Spain and culling of hybrids and <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> began. Here we report on a series of genetic studies that have enabled and supported management decisions to the benefit of the white- headed duck. First, genetic data confirmed that these are two distinct species, each of which is more closely related to other stifftail species. Second, molecular studies indicated that <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> in Spain, Iceland and elsewhere in Europe were of captive origin and not descendants from vagrants from their native North America. Third, genetic methods were used to distin- guish among different hybrid generations in Spain and detected no <b>ruddy</b> <b>duck</b> introgression in birds identi- fied morphologically as white-headed ducks. Collec- tively, these results supported management decisions to eradicate <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> from Europe. Subsequently, a control programme reduced the UK population by over 95 % by 2010, and the arrival of <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> to Spain decreased from 21 birds in 2003 to two sightings in 2010 – 2011. However, increased efforts to control small <b>ruddy</b> <b>duck</b> populations elsewhere in Europe and Morocco are still required to ensure conservation of the white-headed duck. This case of invasion by hybridization demonstrates that successful control is feasible given early detection followed by a rapid response plan; it also shows the contribution of research to management and that to guarantee the conservation of an endangered native species action may be required in countries outside its distribution range.

40|$|Andean uplift {{played a}} key role in Neotropical bird diversification, yet past {{dispersal}} and genetic adaptation to high-altitude environments remain little understood. Here we use multilocus population genetics to study population history and historical demographic processes in the <b>ruddy</b> <b>duck</b> (<b>Oxyura</b> <b>jamaicensis),</b> a stiff-tailed diving duck comprising three subspecies distributed from Canada to Tierra del Fuego and inhabiting wetlands from sea level to 4500 m in the Andes. We sequenced the mitochondrial DNA, four autosomal introns and three haemoglobin genes (αA, αD, βA) and used isolation-with-migration (IM) models to study gene flow between North America and South America, and between the tropical and southern Andes. Our analyses indicated that <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> dispersed first from North America to the tropical Andes, then from the tropical Andes to the southern Andes. While no nonsynonymous substitutions were found in either α globin gene, three amino acid substitutions were observed in the βA globin. Based on phylogenetic reconstruction and power analysis, the first βA substitution, found in all Andean individuals, was acquired when <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> dispersed from low altitude in North America to high altitude in the tropical Andes, whereas the two additional substitutions occurred more recently, when <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> dispersed from high altitude in the tropical Andes to low altitude in the southern Andes. This stepwise colonization pattern accompanied by polarized βA globin amino acid replacements suggest that <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> first acclimatized or adapted to the Andean highlands and then again to the lowlands. In addition, <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> colonized the Andean highlands via a less common route as compared to other waterbird species that colonized the Andes northwards from the southern cone of South America. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

The substrate consisted of a 4 x 4 array of wooden trays (1. 0 -m long, 0. 5 -m wide, and 0. 1 -m deep) which contained 6 cm of sand. Any tray could {{be removed from the}} aquarium and “loaded” with a known number of prey. One bird foraged in the aquarium at a time; thus, by removing a food tray after a trial ended and counting the remaining prey, I calculated the number of prey consumed by the bird. I designed several experiments to determine if <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> abandoned a food patch {{in a manner consistent with}} the predictions of a simple, deterministic, patch depletion model. This model is based on the premise that a predator should maximize its rate of net energy intake while foraging. To accomplish this, a predator should only remain in a food patch as long as its rate of energy intake from that patch exceeds the average rate of intake from the environment. In the majority of comparisons, the number of food items consumed by the <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> in these experiments was consistent with the predictions of the foraging model. When the birds did not forage as predicted by the model, they stayed in the patch longer and consumed more prey than predicted by the model. An examination of the relation between rate of net energy intake and time spent foraging in the food patch indicated that by staying in a patch longer than predicted, the <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> experienced only a small deviation from maximum rate of net energy intake. These results provided quantitative support for the prediction that <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> maximize their rate of net energy intake while foraging...|$|R
40|$|In many taxa, females {{lay eggs}} in the nests of other conspecifics. To {{determine}} {{the conditions under which}} conspecific brood parasitism develops, it is necessary to identify parasitic offspring and the females who produce them; however, for most systems parasitism can be difficult to observe and most genetic approaches have relatively low resolving power. In this study, we used protein fingerprinting from egg albumen and 10 microsatellite loci to genetically match parasitic ducklings to their mothers in a population of <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> (<b>Oxyura</b> <b>jamaicensis).</b> We found that 67 % of nests contained parasitic offspring, and we successfully identified their mothers in 61 % of the cases. Of the parasitic females identified, 77 % also had nests of their own (i. e. a dual tactic, where females both nest and lay parasitically), and we found no evidence that parasitic females pursued a specialist (parasitism only) tactic. We also found that parasitic egg laying was not influenced by nest loss, predation or female condition. Thus, in contrast to most waterfowl studied to date, female <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> appear to lay parasitic eggs whenever the opportunity arises. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 In 1976 and 1977 I {{examined}} {{three broad}} {{problems associated with}} the recruitment of young mallards, Anas platyrhynchos, in the Prairie Pothole Region of North Dakota. The three problems studied were: the effects of interspecific nest parasitism on production; the chronology and magnitude of total-brood loss during the brood-rearing period; and, mobility, home range, and habitat utilization of broods. Nest parasitism occurred only in mallard nests that were in marsh habitat. Of 24 active mallard nests located in marsh habitat during 1976, 46 % were parasitized. Forty-two percent were parasitized by redheads, Aythya americana, and 8 % by <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks,</b> <b>Oxyura</b> <b>jamaicensis.</b> Only three mallard nests were found in marsh habitat in 1977, presumably because of a severe drought, and none were parasitized. Nest parasitism by redheads or <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> did not significantly decrease mallard nest success (P> 0. 05). Parasitism by redheads reduced mallard clutch-size by about 1. 5 eggs; parasitism by <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> had no significant effect on mallard clutch-size. In successful nests, nest parasitism by redheads significantly reduced mallard egg success (P< 0. 05), primarily through host egg displacement. Due to a small sample size, the effect nest parasitism by. <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> had on mallard egg success was not determined. Nest parasitism by redheads could potentially reduce the number of mallards produced in the Prairie Pothole Region during some years. Survival of mallard broods was estimated from data obtained from 25 radio-marked broods monitored during 1976 and 1977. Radio-equipped mallard hens fledged at least one duckling in 44 % of broods initially hatched in 1976 and 55 % in 1977. Combined brood survival for 1976 and 1977 was 48 %. Eighty-five percent of the loss of entire broods occurred within the first two weeks after hatching and all losses occurred in wetlands. Few ducklings and no broods were lost during overland travel. The primary predators on ducklings in wetlands were mink, Mustela vison. Mallard broods were quite mobile during the first few weeks after hatching, but mobility varied greatly between 1976 and 1977. Of 16 broods monitored in 1976, 12 made major overland moves among wetlands and utilized from 2 to 10 different wetlands during the brood-rearing period. In 1977 only 2 of 9 radio-marked broods made major habitat shifts. The reason for the difference in brood mobility between 1976 and 1977 appeared to be related to drought conditions. The area of the corrected 'home range of radio-marked broods increased rapidly until broods were about one week old; by two weeks the home range of most broods was stable. Cumulative home ranges varied among broods but averaged 11. 0 ± 4. 7 ha (mean±SD). Broods used {{only a small portion of}} the home range in any one week period. Generally, the home range of a brood on a particular wetland ranged in size from 4 to 6 ha. Habitats utilized by broods varied greatly between 1976 and 1977. In 1976, when many types of wetlands contained water, mallard hens with broods demonstrated a significant preference for whitetop ponds, but rejection was indicated for other types of seasonal wetlands. In 1976 overall use of semipermanent wetlands was significantly less than expected; but in 1977, when drought conditions prevailed on the study area, semipermanent wetlands were used by mallard broods directly in proportion to their availability. Mallard hens with broods used brood-rearing areas with high standing crops of benthic invertebrates...|$|R

Location The US portion of Bird Conservation Region 11 (US-BCR 11, the Prairie Potholes), which encompasses six states within the United States: Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota and Iowa. Methods We used data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (NABBS), the National Land Cover Data Set, and the National Climatic Data Center to model the effects of environmental variables on waterbird abundance. We evaluated land-use covariates at three logarithmically related spatial scales (1000, 10, 000 and 100, 000 ha), and constructed hierarchical spatial count models a priori using information from published habitat associations. Model fitting was performed using a hierarchical modelling approach within a Bayesian framework. Results Models with the same variables expressed at different scales were often in the best model subset, indicating that the influence of spatial scale was small. Both land-use and climate variables contributed strongly to predicting waterbird abundance in US-BCR 11. The strongest positive influences on waterbird abundance were the percentage of wetland area across all three spatial scales, herbaceous vegetation and precipitation variables. Other variables that we included in our models {{did not appear to}} influence waterbirds in this study. Main conclusions Understanding the relationships of waterbird abundance to climate and land use may allow us to make predictions of future distribution and abundance as environmental factors change.

50|$|Unlike {{most other}} Larus gulls, {{they are highly}} predatory and {{frequently}} hunt and kill any prey smaller than themselves, behaving more like a raptor than a typical larid gull. Lacking the razor-sharp talons and curved, tearing beak of a raptor, the great black-backed gull relies on aggression, physical strength and endurance when hunting. When attacking other animals, they usually attack seabird eggs, nestlings or fledgings at the nest, perhaps most numerously terns, but also including smaller gull species as well as eiders, gannets and various alcids. In Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, 10% of the stomach contents of great black-backed gulls {{was made up of}} birds, while a further 17% of stomach contents was made up of tern eggs alone. Adult or fledged juveniles of various bird species have also been predaceously attacked. Some fully-fledged or adult birds observed to be hunted in flight or on the ground by great black-backed gulls have included Anas <b>ducks,</b> <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> (<b>Oxyura</b> <b>jamaicensis),</b> buffleheads (Bucephala albeola), Manx shearwaters (Puffinus puffinus), pied-billed grebes (Podilymbus podiceps), common moorhens (Gallinula chloropus), terns, Atlantic puffins (Fratercula arctica), coots (Fulica ssp.), hen harriers (Circus cyaneus), glossy ibises (Plegadis falcinellus) and even rock pigeons (Columba livia). When attacking other flying birds, the great black-backed gulls often pursue them on the wing and attack them by jabbing with their bill, hoping to bring down the other bird either by creating an open wound or simply via exhaustion. They will also catch flying passerines, which they typically target while the small birds are exhausted from migration and swallow them immediately. Great black-backed gull also feed on land animals, including rats (Rattus ssp.) at garbage dumps and even sickly lambs (Ovis aries).|$|R
