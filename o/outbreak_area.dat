40|$|Abstract 1 One {{expected}} {{effect of}} global climate change on insect populations is a shift in geographical distributions toward higher latitudes and higher elevations. South-ern pine beetle Dendroctonus frontalis and mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae undergo regional outbreaks that result in large-scale disturbances to pine forests in the south-eastern and western United States, respectively. 2 Our objective was to investigate potential range shifts under climate change of <b>outbreak</b> <b>areas</b> for both bark beetle species and the areas of occurrence of the forest types susceptible to them. 3 To project range changes, we used discriminant function models that incor-porated climatic variables. Models to project bark beetle ranges employed changed forest distributions as well as changes in climatic variables. 4 Projected <b>outbreak</b> <b>areas</b> for southern pine beetle increased with higher temperatures and generally shifted northward, as did the distributions of the southern pine forests. 5 Projected <b>outbreak</b> <b>areas</b> for mountain pine beetle decreased with increasing temperature and shifted toward higher elevation. That trend was mirrored in the projected distributions of pine forests in the region of the western U. S. encompassed by the study. 6 Projected <b>outbreak</b> <b>areas</b> for the two bark beetle species and the area of occurrence of western pine forests increased with more precipitation and decreased with less precipitation, whereas the area of occurrence of southern pine forests decreased slightly with increasing precipitation. 7 Predicted shifts of outbreak ranges for both bark beetle species followed general expectations for the effects {{of global climate}} change and reflected the under-lying long-term distributional shifts of their host forests...|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} {{locust control}} strategy assumed that plagues arose when swarms escaped from <b>outbreak</b> <b>areas</b> and bred {{successfully in the}} surrounding invasion area. Thus, control within <b>outbreak</b> <b>areas</b> could prevent plagues. Plague prevention was achieved for species with small, relatively accessible <b>outbreak</b> <b>areas</b> providing resources allocated to preventive control allowed continuous monitoring and rapid treatment as outbreaks appeared. Plague preventionwas less successful for species such as the Australian Plague Locust and the Desert Locust in which pre-plague bands and swarms develop and migrate within very large geographical areas. The success of preventive control can be demonstrated, however, by comparing population size and distribution {{before and after the}} strategy was implemented using effective control techniques. Some but not all recent plagues of the Australian Plague Locust have been prevented and, although the frequency of Desert Locust plagues has not declined in the last 40 years, their duration and extent has been sufficiently reduced to achieve the original objective of keeping major agricultural zones in the invasion area locust free. In Australia, substantial resources and the latest technology were available to implement early intervention and its success has been clearly demonstrated. We used a simple model to quantify the case for early intervention in Desert Locust campaigns and our simulations suggest that applying even a conservative rate of control from the beginning of an upsurge as part of early intervention would further reduce the size of upsurges and plagues and would contribute to a better managed Desert Locust population...|$|R
50|$|The misnomer ‘beaver fever’ {{was invented}} by the American press in the 1970s after an {{outbreak}} of Giardia lamblia, which causes giardiasis, was blamed on beavers. However, the <b>outbreak</b> <b>area</b> was also frequented by humans, who are generally {{the primary source of}} contamination of waters. In addition, many animals and birds carry this parasite. Giardiasis affects humans in southeastern Norway, but a recent study found no Giardia in the beavers there. Recent concerns point to domestic animals as a significant vector of Giardia, with young calves in dairy herds testing as high as 100% positive for Giardia. New Zealand has Giardia but no beavers. In a 1995 paper recommending reintroduction of beaver to Great Britain, MacDonald stated that the only new diseases that beaver might convey to that country's birds and mammals, are rabies and tularaemia - both diseases that should be preventable by statutory quarantine procedures and prophylactic treatment for tularaemia.|$|E
50|$|Pine {{forests in}} British Columbia have been devastated by a pine beetle infestation, which has {{expanded}} unhindered since 1998 {{at least in}} part {{due to the lack of}} severe winters since that time; a few days of extreme cold kill most mountain pine beetles and have kept outbreaks in the past naturally contained. The infestation, which (by November 2008) has killed about half of the province's lodgepole pines (33 million acres or 135,000 km²) is an order of magnitude larger than any previously recorded outbreak. One reason for unprecedented host tree mortality may be due to that the mountain pine beetles have higher reproductive success in lodgepole pine trees growing in areas where the trees have not experienced frequent beetle epidemics, which includes much of the current <b>outbreak</b> <b>area.</b> In 2007 the outbreak spread, via unusually strong winds, over the continental divide to Alberta. An epidemic also started, be it at a lower rate, in 1999 in Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana.

40|$|Population {{density and}} {{individual}} dispersal behaviour affect species' distribution dynamics. Population densities vary over time, and some species occasionally increase to very high numbers, for example during outbreaks. In such situations, populations {{are expected to}} expand into new areas {{as a result of}} density-dependent dispersal which sometimes even results in range expansion. A local population of the northern pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pinivora has recently reached outbreak densities at the edge of its northern range at the southern tip of Gotland Island in the Baltic Sea. We first investigated whether the outbreak had resulted in establishment of populations in suitable habitats on Gotland Island outside the <b>outbreak</b> <b>area.</b> Six small populations were found that could potentially have originated from the <b>outbreak</b> <b>area.</b> However, data from 12 microsatellite markers strongly suggest that these populations did not originate from the recent outbreak. Genetic variability was not reduced in these small, isolated populations, and there were several unique alleles, indicating instead a different population history and that there has been no recent range expansion. In addition, there was apparent genetic isolation by geographic distance, implying that despite the high density of the outbreak population, significant gene flow has not occurred. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The first {{recorded}} outbreak of yellow fever in Kenya occurred from mid- 1992 through March 1993 {{in the south}} Kerio Valley, Rift Valley Province. We conducted entomologic studies in February-March 1993 to identify the likely vectors and determine the potential for transmission in the surrounding rural and urban areas. Mosquitoes were collected by landing capture and processed for virus isolation. Container surveys were conducted around human habitation. Transmission was mainly in woodland of varying density, at altitudes of 1, 300 – 1, 800 m. The abundance of Aedes africanus in this biotope, and two isolations of virus from pools of this species, suggest {{that it was the}} principal vector in the main period of the outbreak. A third isolate was made from a pool of Ae. keniensis, a little-known species that was collected in the same biotope.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate various environmental compartments surrounding <b>outbreak</b> <b>areas</b> as potential sources for H 5 N 1 virus transmission. METHODS: Environmental specimens were collected following outbreaks of avian influenza in Cambodia between April 2007 and February 2010. The methods used to concentrate H 5 N 1 virus from water samples were based either on agglutination of the virus with chicken red blood cells or on adsorption on glass wool, followed by an elution-concentration step. An elution-concentration method was used for mud specimens. All samples that tested positive by real-time RT-PCRs (qRT-PCRs) targeting the HA 5, M and NA 1 genes were inoculated into embryonated hen eggs for virus isolation. RESULTS: Of a total of 246 samples, 46 (19 %) tested positive for H 5 N 1 by qRT-PCRs. Viral RNA was frequently detected in dust, mud and soil samples from the farms' environment (respectively, 46 %, 31 % and 15 %). Samples collected from ponds gave a lower proportion of positive samples (6 %) as compared to those collected from the farms (24 %). In only one sample, infectious virus particles were successfully isolated. CONCLUSION: During H 5 N 1 virus outbreaks, numerous environmental samples surrounding <b>outbreak</b> <b>areas</b> are contaminated by the virus and may act as potential sources for human and/or animal contamination...|$|R

A small outbreak of P. vivax malaria, in a village located in a non-malarious area of Brazil, offered {{us an opportunity to}} investigate the DBP immune responses among individuals who had their first and brief exposure to malaria. Thirty-three individuals participated in the five cross-sectional surveys, 15 with confirmed P. vivax infection while residing in the <b>outbreak</b> <b>area</b> (cases) and 18 who had not experienced malaria (non-cases). In the present study, we found that only 20 % (three of 15) of the individuals who experienced their first P. vivax infection developed an antibody response to DBP; a secondary boosting can be achieved with a recurrent P. vivax infection. DNA sequences from primary/recurrent P. vivax samples identified a single dbp allele among the samples from the <b>outbreak</b> <b>area.</b> To investigate inhibitory antibodies to the ligand domain of the DBP (cysteine-rich region II, DBP(II)), we performed in vitro assays with mammalian cells expressing DBP(II) sequences which were homologous or not to those from the outbreak isolate. In non-immune individuals, the results of a 12 -month follow-up period provided evidence that naturally acquired inhibitory antibodies to DBP(II) are short-lived and biased towards a specific allele.
