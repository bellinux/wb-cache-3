5|$|Every full moon, tens of {{thousands}} <b>of</b> <b>pilgrims</b> worship Annamalaiyar by circumambulating the Arunachala hill barefoot. The circumambulation covers a distance of , and is referred as Girivalam. According to Hindu legend, the walk removes sins, fulfils desires and helps achieve freedom from the cycle of birth and rebirth. Offerings are made {{in a string of}} tanks, shrines, pillared meditation halls, springs and caves around the hill. The circumambulation continues {{during the rest of the}} month. On the day of yearly Chitra Pournami, the full moon of the Tamil calendar, hundreds {{of thousands}} <b>of</b> <b>pilgrims</b> come from across the world to worship Annamalaiyar. Five temple cars, called ther, with wooden carvings, are used for the procession.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{the pilgrimage}} to Mecca was mainly an {{overland}} journey using camels {{as a means}} of transport. During {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century (after 1850s), steamships began to be used in the pilgrimage journey to Mecca, and the number <b>of</b> <b>pilgrims</b> traveling on sea route increased. This continued for some time, until air travel came to predominate; Egypt introduced the first airline service for Hajj pilgrims in 1937. Today, many airlines and travel agents offer Hajj packages, and arrange for transportation and accommodation for the pilgrims. King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah and Prince Mohammad Bin Abdulaziz Airport in Medina have dedicated pilgrim terminals to assist the arrival <b>of</b> <b>pilgrims.</b> Other international airports around the world, such as Indira Gandhi in New Delhi, Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad, Jinnah in Karachi and Soekarno-Hatta in Jakarta also have dedicated terminals or temporary facilities to service pilgrims as they depart and return home. During Hajj, many airlines run extra flights to accommodate the large number <b>of</b> <b>pilgrims.</b>|$|E

Mírzá Yahyá had gone into hiding after the assassination attempt on the Shah, and after Bahá'u'lláh's exile to Baghdad, he chose to join his brother there. At the same time, {{an increasing number of}} Bábís considered Baghdad the new center for leadership of the Bábí religion, and a flow <b>of</b> <b>pilgrims</b> started going there from Persia.|$|E
5|$|The art of mother-of-pearl carving {{is said to}} {{have been}} a Bethlehem {{tradition}} since the 15th century when it was introduced by Franciscan friars from Italy. A constant stream <b>of</b> <b>pilgrims</b> generated a demand for these items, which also provided jobs for women. The industry was noted by Richard Pococke, who visited Bethlehem in 1727.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of 'inscription stones' {{collected}} by King Bodawpaya are {{seen in a long}} gallery in the southeastern corner of the temple courtyard. These inscriptions, some of which are made from gilded marble and sandstone, have been collected from many regions of the country. There is also a large water tank in the southeast direction of the temple where fish and turtles are fed with rice cakes by the large number <b>of</b> <b>pilgrims</b> who visit the temple every day. Adjacent to the Buddha temple is the Mahamuni Museum, which contains displays of Buddhism throughout Asia.|$|E

5|$|After the First Crusade's {{capture of}} Jerusalem and victory at Ascalon the {{majority}} of the Crusaders considered their pilgrimage complete and returned to Europe. Godfrey was left with only 300 knights and 2,000 infantry to defend the territory won in the Eastern Mediterranean. Only Tancred of the crusader princes remained with the aim of establishing his own lordship. At this point the Franks held only Jerusalem and two great Syrian cities; Antioch and Edessa but not the surrounding country. Jerusalem remained economically sterile despite the advantages of being the centre of administration of church and state and benefitting from streams <b>of</b> <b>pilgrims.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{exception}} {{was made for}} Christians to participate in Christmas ceremonies in Bethlehem. Some sources claim Jews could only visit the wall if they traveled through Jordan (which {{was not an option}} for Israelis) and did not have an Israeli visa stamped in their passports. Only Jordanian soldiers and tourists were to be found there. A vantage point on Mount Zion, from which the Wall could be viewed, became the place where Jews gathered to pray. For thousands <b>of</b> <b>pilgrims,</b> the mount, being the closest location to the Wall under Israeli control, became a substitute site for the traditional priestly blessing ceremony which takes place on the Three Pilgrimage Festivals.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the many}} {{literary}} sources, Eliot also draws {{on his personal}} feelings and experience, especially on the great stress that he felt while composing the poem. Similarly, Eliot used the image <b>of</b> <b>pilgrims</b> coming to America and the stories of them that were common throughout his childhood. In particular, his mother wrote poems about the pilgrims arriving in New England, and Eliot found information related to his family's history in a book called Sketch of the Eliot Family. The location, East Coker, was where Andrew Eliott, T. S. Eliot's ancestor, left when joining the pilgrimage.|$|E

5|$|Nagore dargah is {{a common}} place of worship for devotees of various {{religious}} faiths. According to {{the administration of the}} dargah, about 50–75 per cent <b>of</b> <b>pilgrims</b> visiting the dargah everyday are Hindus. The practise of offering flowers, sweetmeats and food, the way of conducting worship, and playing musical instruments like nadaswaram (a type of pipe instrument commonly used in Tamil Nadu) are atypical of Hindu tradition. Other worship practises include offering flags and lighting lamps of ghee at the saint's tomb. Devotees shave their heads near the tank and offer tin or silver-plated facsimiles of body parts, houses, sailboats matching their material needs.|$|E
5|$|The Archbishop of Canterbury is the primate of the Church of England and the {{worldwide}} Anglican Communion {{owing to the}} importance of St Augustine, who served as the apostle to the pagan Kingdom of Kent {{around the turn of the}} 7th century. The city's cathedral became a major focus of pilgrimage following the 1170 martyrdom of Thomas Becket, although it had already been a well-trodden pilgrim destination since the murder of St Alphege by the men of King Canute in 1012. A journey <b>of</b> <b>pilgrims</b> to Becket's shrine served as the frame for Geoffrey Chaucer's 14th century classic The Canterbury Tales.|$|E
5|$|The {{stone was}} venerated at the Kaaba in pre-Islamic pagan times. According to Islamic tradition, {{it was set}} intact into the Kaaba's wall by the prophet Muhammad in the year 605 AD, five years before his first revelation. Since then it has been broken {{into a number of}} {{fragments}} and is now cemented into a silver frame {{in the side of the}} Kaaba. Its physical appearance is that of a fragmented dark rock, polished smooth by the hands <b>of</b> <b>pilgrims.</b> Islamic tradition holds that it fell from heaven as a guide for Adam and Eve to build an altar. It has often been described as a meteorite, a hypothesis which is now uncertain.|$|E

5|$|Though ideologically {{the temples}} are {{divided between the}} sects of Hinduism, namely Saivism and Vaishnavism, the Char Dham pilgrimage is an all-Hindu affair. There are four abodes in the Himalayas called Chota Char Dham (Chota meaning small): Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotriall of which lie {{in the foothills of}} the Himalayas. The name Chota was added during the mid of 20th century to {{differentiate}} the original Char Dhams. As the number <b>of</b> <b>pilgrims</b> to these places has increased in modern times, it is called Himalayan Char Dham.|$|E
5|$|After {{ten days}} of balloting in Rome, without any {{candidate}} approaching the requisite two-thirds, the cardinals adjourned until June {{and changed the}} location of the election from Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore to Santa Maria sopra Minerva. After a summer epidemic in the city, and the death of Cholet in August, they dispersed until late September. The non-Roman cardinals went to Rieti (except Caetani, who went to his native Anagni) while the Roman cardinals remained in the city. As balloting continued into the next summer, the disorder in Rome increased dramatically (even by the standards of a sede vacante, during which, based on the biblical example of Barabbas, all prisoners were released). The deaths of newly elected Roman Senators Agapitus Colonna and Ursus Orsini around Easter 1293 further exacerbated the anarchy within the city, which had been marked by the destruction of palaces, the slaying <b>of</b> <b>pilgrims,</b> and the sacking of churches. After the summer of 1293, the cardinals dispersed and agreed to reconvene in Perugia on October 18.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} part of the work was devoted to the miracles and glorification of Ely's patroness, Saint Æthelthryth. The very beginning of the work incorporates an earlier Vita, or Life, of Æthelthryth, which resembles the Vitae of other saints written by Goscelin in the 11th century; Goscelin is known to have visited Ely. The work may have helped to increase the number <b>of</b> <b>pilgrims</b> visiting Ely, as well as enabling the monks to better explain the history of earlier donations to the abbey. Many of the gifts to the abbey church are described, such as the altar cloth donated by Queen Emma (died 1052), wife of both King Æthelred II (died 1016) and King Cnut (died 1035), with a short history of the circumstances of the gift. The miracle stories frequently say that those who wished cures or miracles similar to those in the Liber would need to come to the monastery, where they could make a donation. The historian Jennifer Paxton argues that increasing pilgrimage to the monastery {{was one of the main}} goals of the compilers of the Liber.|$|E
