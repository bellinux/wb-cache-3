5|$|Half of {{the sermon}} {{is used to}} criticise the Whigs and their {{political}} activities. The <b>other</b> <b>half</b> is devoted to condemning Tories who betray other Tories as criminals, to gain favour with the Whigs. The Whigs are characterised as the persecutors of the early Christians, and betraying Tories are characterised as apostates.|$|E

60|$|The {{fishing vessels}} were still crowded together, running to and fro, out and in, without {{definite}} purpose, plunging over the heaving swells--some of them {{visible on the}} crests, <b>others</b> <b>half</b> hidden in the hollows--and behaving generally like living creatures that were impatiently awaiting the signal to begin a race.|$|R

5|$|The {{new wave}} of {{construction}} brings the university's stock of houses to 328, including several duplexes. Not including these new additions, as of 2005, the university owned 225 houses in the Ghetto, with the rest on the Darkside, the <b>other</b> <b>half</b> of the University of Dayton campus. Additionally, 73 houses in the neighborhood were owned by private landlords and rented to UD students.|$|E
5|$|The <b>other</b> <b>half</b> of {{the matchup}} {{would consist of}} either Notre Dame or the first {{selection}} from the Big East Conference after that conference's automatic BCS bid. Because Notre Dame was selected {{to play in the}} 2006 Fiesta Bowl, a BCS game, the Gator Bowl Association was required to select the Big East's Louisville Cardinals, which, like Virginia Tech, finished second in their conference.|$|E
5|$|The predation-avoidance {{behavior}} of sleeping {{with one eye}} open, allowing one brain hemisphere to remain aware while the <b>other</b> <b>half</b> sleeps, was first demonstrated in mallards, although it {{is believed to be}} widespread among birds in general.|$|E

5|$|Troop sleeper #7437 is {{on display}} at the B Railroad Museum in Baltimore, MD. It was {{purchased}} as surplus by the Western Maryland Railroad and used on work trains as crew quarters.

5|$|Unlike most animals, {{whales are}} {{conscious}} breathers. All mammals sleep, but whales cannot afford to become unconscious for long {{because they may}} drown. They are believed to exhibit unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, in which they sleep {{with half of the}} brain while the <b>other</b> <b>half</b> remains active. This behavior was only documented in toothed whales until footage of a humpback whale sleeping (vertically) was shot in 2014.|$|E

25|$|The first {{casualties}} {{after the}} adoption of Resolution 181(II) by the General Assembly were passengers on a Jewish bus driving on the Coastal Plain near Kfar Sirkin on 30 November. An eight-man gang from Jaffa ambushed the bus killing five and wounding <b>others.</b> <b>Half</b> an hour later they ambushed a second bus, southbound from Hadera, killing two more.

5|$|After {{six days}} of state {{government}} shutdown, Corzine and Assembly Democrats agreed to raise the state sales tax to 7% {{with half of the}} 1% increase going to the state budget and the <b>other</b> <b>half</b> going to property tax relief. On July 8, 2006, the $30billion state budget, with the sales tax agreement, passed both houses and Governor Corzine signed the budget into law ending the budget impasse.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} game, the CGI cutscenes were created by Digital Frontier. The staff numbers, including those working on the cutscenes, went from around one hundred for Path of Radiance to around 200 for Radiant Dawn: half the staff worked on the game itself, while the <b>other</b> <b>half</b> worked on the cutscenes. For the cutscenes, Digital Frontier were asked to show a more epic scope rather than just focusing on the characters, a trend from Path of Radiance the developers felt was wrong. All of the character movements in cutscenes were mapped using motion capture, with between 100 and 150 animations per character to implement.|$|E
5|$|Basiliscus fled in {{the heat}} of the battle. One half of the Roman fleet was burned, sunk, or captured, and the <b>other</b> <b>half</b> {{followed}} the fugitive Basiliscus. The whole expedition had failed. Heraclius effected his retreat through the desert into Tripolitania, holding the position for two years until recalled; Marcellinus retired to Sicily, where he was reached by Basiliscus; the general was, however, assassinated, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer, by one of his own captains; and the king of the Vandals expressed his surprise and satisfaction, that the Romans themselves would remove from the world his most formidable antagonists.|$|E

50|$|In the Middle Ages, Oberstreit {{was divided}} between two lordships, {{and this is}} {{reflected}} in the coat of arms. The “countercompony” pattern (two chequered rows) on the dexter (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) side are a reference to (half) the village’s former allegiance to the Counts of Sponheim, while the charge on the sinister (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) side, the fish, is a reference to the <b>other</b> <b>half’s</b> former allegiance to the Counts of Salm, Salm being a German word for “salmon”.|$|R
5|$|Between 24 and 25° degrees {{southern}} latitude the Andean Dry Diagonal crosses the Andes. At this latitude, {{half of the}} precipitation falls in summer and the <b>other</b> <b>half</b> in winter. The formation of this dry diagonal is an effect both of the rainshadow effect of the Andes, air subsidence within South Pacific High, and the cold Humboldt Current off the Pacific coast. This {{is the reason why}} the Atacama Desert exists. The extremely arid climate at Llullaillaco is also a consequence of these climatic effects.|$|E
5|$|Binary search {{works on}} sorted arrays. Binary search begins by {{comparing}} the middle element of the array with the target value. If the target value matches the middle element, {{its position in the}} array is returned. If the target value is less than or greater than the middle element, the search continues in the lower or upper half of the array, respectively, eliminating the <b>other</b> <b>half</b> from consideration.|$|E
5|$|Black {{contacts}} Seattle Police Department detective Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) {{for information}} on Rothenburg. Her husband found her when he came home, assuming that she had surprised a burglar. Elsewhere, her attacker shoots the clerk in a liquor store, again hearing the victim give permission to be killed. Black and Bletcher review security camera footage of the crime, which leads to them discovering half a playing card—the Jack of Spades—at the scene. Rothenburg's home is searched and the <b>other</b> <b>half</b> is found there.|$|E

5|$|Carr Hill Nook {{has a high}} {{proportion}} of lone parent households at some 19.3% of all households. This is the fourth highest figure in Gateshead and compares with a borough average of 11.5%. Some 36.9% of households have dependent children, as opposed to 29.5% nationally and 28.4% in Gateshead. This is also the fourth-highest figure in Gateshead. The Index of Multiple Deprivation, which divides England into 32,482 areas and measures quality of life to indicate deprivation, splits Carr Hill into halves and lists one half in the top 5% of all deprived areas in England in 2008. The <b>other</b> <b>half</b> is listed in the top 20% of all deprived areas.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët entered electoral {{politics}} in August 1945, when {{elections for the}} Abidjan city council were held for the first time. The French electoral rules established a common roll: half of the elected {{would have to be}} French citizens (who were mostly Europeans) and the <b>other</b> <b>half</b> non-citizens. Houphouët reacted by creating a multi-ethnic all-African roll with both non-citizens and citizens (mostly Senegalese with French citizenship). As a result, most of the African contenders withdrew and a large number of the French protested by abstaining, thus assuring a decisive victory for his African Bloc.|$|E
5|$|In another {{stable isotope}} analysis, {{half of the}} Beringian wolves {{were found to be}} muskox and caribou specialists, and the <b>other</b> <b>half</b> were either horse and bison specialists or generalists. Two wolves from the full-glacial period (23,000–18,000 YBP) were found to be mammoth specialists, {{but it is not clear}} if this was due to {{scavenging}} or predation. The analysis of other carnivore fossils from the Fairbanks region of Alaska found that mammoth was rare in the diets of the other Beringian carnivores.|$|E
