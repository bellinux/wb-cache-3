White Wolf's page dedicated to the set indicates the reasoning for calling it the third edition: [...] "White Wolf's eleventh expansion for Vampire: The Eternal Struggle is a stand-alone base set. It is called Third Edition (after the Camarilla Edition, which is reckoned as the second edition)." [...] The expansion {{also happens to be}} the third set based on the Sabbat sect. It contained {{a whole new set of}} vampires, but mainly reprints of library cards. Due to insufficient quality management the distribution of the cards in the boosters and the <b>overall</b> <b>printing</b> quality was significantly worse than in previous expansions. In addition the card backs are printed upside-down (in comparison to all other expansions). De facto it is now required to use card sleeves in tournaments when a player uses cards from the 3rd Edition set mixed with cards from other expansions. These flaws caused some resentment towards the 3rd Edition set in the player community. Nonetheless the expansion won the InQuest Gamer 2007 Fan Awards for best trading card expansion.|$|E

A 3 D printer liquefier must transmit heat to the thermoplastic material in order to extrude it, reaching temperatures above 200 degrees for some materials like ABS on the tip of the nozzle. The design of the heating process must comply with keeping the balance between proper heating of the material and controlling the temperature along the extruding body, so that the printer itself is not harmed for overtemperature. On the other hand, the design must guarantee that the melting front is located in an intermediate point between the nozzle tip and the entrance of the raw material, to minimize pressure drops in the system, and so decreasing the demanding energy to the feeding motors. An alternative design of the heating system, Twist 3 D, is proposed in this paper. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of toner usage {{is an area}} of on-going importance for laser, electrophotographic (EP) printers. In Part 1, we propose a new two-stage approach in which we first predict on a pixel-by-pixel basis, the absorptance from printed and scanned pages. We then form a weighted sum of these pixel values to predict overall toner usage on the printed page. The weights are chosen by least-squares regression to toner usage measured with a set of printed test pages. Our two-stage predictor significantly outperforms existing methods that are based on a simple pixel counting strategy in terms of both accuracy and robustness of the predictions. ^ In Part 2, we describe a raster-input-based object map generation algorithm (OMGA) for laser, electrophotographic (EP) printers. The object map is utilized in the object-oriented halftoning approach, where different halftone screens and color maps are applied to different types of objects on the page in order to improve the <b>overall</b> <b>printing</b> quality. The OMGA generates object map from the raster input directly. It solves problems such as the object map obtained from the page description language (PDL) is incorrect, and an initial object map is unavailable from the processing pipeline. A new imaging pipeline for the laser EP printer incorporating both the OMGA and the object-oriented halftoning approach is proposed. The OMGA is a segmentation-based classification approach. It first detects objects according to the edge information, and then classifies the objects by analyzing the feature values extracted from the contour and the interior of each object. The OMGA is designed to be hardware-friendly, and can be implemented within two passes through the input document. ...|$|E

This thesis sets out to examine {{the development of this}} subsector by examining the market structure of the sector, identifying the competitive forces that exist and outlining the strategies adopted by the firms in the market. The starting point for the thesis is an examination of the traditional structureconduct- performance model and its relationship with the wider business policy field. - This examination is elementary and serves to provide a very useful starting point. Next a specific framework is developed to examine the software manual printing sector. This framework concentrates on the dimensions of structure and conduct, with the causality flowing from structural criteria; conduct is equated with a firm 2 ̆ 7 s business strategy. The dimension of performance is reduced in importance, reflecting the view that performance is largely a matter for the individual firms; however performance does influence both conduct and structure. Before examining the software manual sector an outline is provided of the printing and publishing industry (NACE 473 / 474). This outline highlights the broader industrial context within which the software manual printing industry has emerged. The software manual printing sector is examined by means of the industrial organisation framework developed. This comprises two elements; an analysis of the market structure, along the dimensions of market definition, market concentration and entry barriers, and a review of the generic strategies adopted by the suppliers.

For insight into which perceived attributes are critical and to help us select and design objective measurement algorithms, we started by conducting a subjective survey. Guided by the results, we performed quantitative stroke quality measurements and found good correlations between basic stroke properties (e. g., blurriness, stroke width and contrast) and the subjective survey results.

A unique feature of the model is its explicit allowance for multiplier effects to exist between the level of print media (newspaper ad and flyers) expenditures provided by the Washington State Apple Commission (WAC) in support of apple demand and supplementary funds provided by retailers in support of apple promotion. In particular the model allows for the fact that Commission funds oftentimes represent only a relatively small fraction of the <b>overall</b> <b>print</b> media expenditures made in support of apple sales, and that Commission funds are often effectively only “pump priming ” or serve as inducements for additional promotional activities by other entrepreneurs in the marketing chain.

40|$|Print {{quality and}} the {{printability}} of paper are very important attributes when modern printing applications are considered. In prints containing images, high print quality is a basic requirement. Tone unevenness and non uniform glossiness of printed products are the most disturbing factors influencing <b>overall</b> <b>print</b> quality. These defects are caused by non ideal interactions of paper, ink and printing devices in high speed printing processes. Since print quality is a perceptive characteristic, the measurement of unevenness according to human vision is a significant problem. In this thesis, the mottling phenomenon is studied. Mottling is a printing defect characterized by a spotty, non uniform appearance in solid printed areas. Print mottle is usually the result of uneven ink lay down or non uniform ink absorption across the paper surface, especially visible in mid tone imagery or areas of uniform color, such as solids and continuous tone screen builds. By using existing knowledge on visual perception and known methods to quantify print tone variation, a new method for print unevenness evaluation is introduced. The method is compared to previous results {{in the field and}} is supported by psychometric experiments. Pilot studies are made to estimate the effect of optical paper characteristics prior to printing, on the unevenness of the printed area after printing. Instrumental methods for print unevenness evaluation have been compared and the results of the comparison indicate that the proposed method produces better results in terms of visual evaluation correspondence. The method has been successfully implemented as ail industrial application and is proved to be a reliable substitute to visual expertise...|$|R
