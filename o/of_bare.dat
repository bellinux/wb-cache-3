5|$|Great mullein most {{frequently}} grows as a colonist <b>of</b> <b>bare</b> and disturbed soil, usually on sandy or chalky ones. It grows best in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, {{although it can}} grow {{in a variety of}} habitats, including banksides, meadows, roadsides, forest clearings and pastures. This ability to grow {{in a wide range of}} habitats has been linked to strong phenotype variation rather than adaptation capacities.|$|E
5|$|The motmots have {{colorful}} plumage and long, graduated tails {{which they}} display by waggling back and forth. In {{most of the}} species, the barbs near {{the ends of the}} two longest (central) tail feathers are weak and fall off, leaving a length <b>of</b> <b>bare</b> shaft and creating a racket-shaped tail.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Beonna's life or his reign, as nothing in written form has survived from this period of East Anglian history. The very few primary sources for Beonna consist <b>of</b> <b>bare</b> {{references}} to his accession or rule written by late chroniclers, that until quite recently were impossible to verify. Since 1980, {{a sufficient number of}} coins have been found to show that he was indeed a historical figure. They have allowed scholars to make deductions about economic and linguistic links that existed between East Anglia and other parts of both England and northern Europe during his reign, as well as aspects of his own identity and rule.|$|E

5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater is {{generally}} {{held to be}} {{the only member of the}} genus, although its plumage suggests an affinity with honeyeaters of the genus Melithreptus. It has been classified in that genus by Glen Storr, although others felt it more closely related to wattlebirds (Anthochaera) or miners (Manorina). A 2004 molecular study has resolved it as close to Melithreptus after all. Molecular clock estimates indicate the blue-faced honeyeater diverged from the Melithreptus honeyeaters somewhere between 12.8 and 6.4 million years ago, in the Miocene epoch. It differs from them in its much larger size, brighter plumage, more gregarious nature and larger patch <b>of</b> <b>bare</b> facial skin.|$|E
5|$|The female {{develops}} a brood patch <b>of</b> <b>bare</b> skin and plays {{the main part}} in incubating the eggs. The male helps, but can only cover the eggs rather than truly incubate them. The female spends the night incubating during this period, while the male roosts near the nest. Eggs hatch at the same time, after a short incubation period lasting 11–14days, and exceptionally {{for as many as}} 17 or as few as 9. The length of the incubation period decreases as ambient temperature increases later in the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|Disturbance is {{important}} in the creation of biodiverse habitats. In the absence of disturbance, a climax vegetation cover develops that prevents the establishment of other species. Wildflower meadows are sometimes created by conservationists but most of the flowering plants used are either annuals or biennials and disappear after a few years in the absence of patches <b>of</b> <b>bare</b> ground on which their seedlings can grow. Lightning strikes and toppled trees in tropical forests allow species richness to be maintained as pioneering species move in to fill the gaps created. Similarly coastal habitats can become dominated by kelp until the seabed is disturbed by a storm and the algae swept away, or shifting sediment exposes new areas for colonisation. Another cause of disturbance is when an area may be overwhelmed by an invasive introduced species which is not kept under control by natural enemies in its new habitat.|$|E

5|$|The Negros {{fruit dove}} (Ptilinopus arcanus) is {{a species of}} bird in the pigeon and dove family, Columbidae. It is endemic to the island of Negros in the Philippines. This fruit dove is known from a single female {{specimen}} collected from the slopes of Mount Kanlaon {{in the northern part}} of the island. While it was found at a high elevation, it is suspected that the species originally lived in the lowland dipterocarp forests and was driven to higher elevations by habitat destruction. While some have suggested that the specimen is either a runt or a hybrid instead of a valid species, this is not widely accepted. The female Negros fruit dove was a small fruit dove with vivid dark green plumage and an ashy-grey forehead. It had a distinctive ring <b>of</b> <b>bare</b> yellow skin around its eye, and yellow fringes to some of its feathers gave it the appearance of having a yellow wingbar when perched. The throat was white, while the undertail and vent were yellow.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} {{exhibited a}} contrast <b>of</b> <b>bare</b> nave walls against the paintings {{drawn on the}} metal ceilings leading to the main altar and retablo mayor. The ceiling paintings {{were known to be}} works of Raymundo Francia, as shown by his signature on one corner of the dome in the 1930s. An acknowledgment on the initiative of the San Tarcisio Martir Maribojoc Catholic Association 'Comité de Obras' could also be seen painted before the crossing. Several paintings by Francia on metal had deteriorated even before the total destruction of the church by earthquake in 2013. The Francia paintings were never touched up nor repainted. The new church dome (or cimborrio) was constructed in June 1889. Ray Francia was again commissioned to do mural works on the cimborrio by painting the Epistles of The Four Apostles, namely the saints John, Matthew, Luke and Mark.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of the {{cockatoos}} is less brightly coloured {{than that}} of the other parrots, with species generally being either black, grey or white. Many species have smaller areas of colour on their plumage, often yellow, pink and red, usually on the crest or tail. The galah and Major Mitchell's cockatoo are more broadly coloured in pink tones. Several species have a brightly coloured bare area around the eye and face known as a periophthalmic ring; the large red patch <b>of</b> <b>bare</b> skin of the palm cockatoo is the most extensive and covers some of the face, while it is more restricted in some other species of white cockatoo, notably the corellas and blue-eyed cockatoo. The plumage of males and females is similar in most species. The plumage of the female cockatiel is duller than the male, but the most marked sexual dimorphism occurs in the gang-gang cockatoo and the two species of black cockatoos in the subgenus Calyptorhynchus, namely the red-tailed and glossy black cockatoos. The iris colour differs in a few species, being pink or red in the female galah and Major Mitchell's cockatoo and red-brown in some other female white cockatoo species. The males all have dark brown irises.|$|E
