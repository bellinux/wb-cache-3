5|$|Realizing {{that the}} {{phenomenon}} {{occurring in the}} room is far <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> house, Jill theorizes that the stone tape can be recorded over again and again, like magnetic recording tape; the maid's death was simply the most recent and clearest recording. Independently continuing her research, Jill realizes that the maid's death was masking a much older recording, left many thousands of years ago. Brock cruelly dismisses her findings, and forces Jill to take a two-month leave to prevent her from continuing her research.|$|E

5|$|The {{indeterminate}} specimen TMP2002.76.1 is {{from the}} Dinosaur Park Formation and, if it belongs to Achelousaurus, the genus would be the stratigraphically oldest known pachyrhinosaurine taxon. Achelousaurus would then also be the only Campanian ceratopsid known {{from more than one}} formation. Both animals occur right below the marine shales of the Bearpaw Formation, but due to longitudinal differences, TMP2002.76.1 is about 500,000years <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Achelousaurus fossils from the Two Medicine Formation.|$|E
5|$|The poem, {{following}} the traditional Kalevala metre, has survived as several 17th and 18th century literations from {{various parts of}} Finland. Some of its elements appear in earlier works, but it hardly dates <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> vita. There is debate on whether the original poem was constructed {{by one or more}} individuals. The writer has however had superficial understanding of the church legends.|$|E
5|$|A {{high-profile}} shooter, Walsh won numerous tournaments {{within the}} FBI and the Marine Corps, {{as well as}} nationally, and participated in the 1948 Summer Olympics.

At the FBI's 100th anniversary celebration he was recognized as the oldest living former agent and noted as being a year <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> organization itself. Aside from some hearing and memory loss, he remained physically fit at his 103rd birthday and, in March 2013, became the longest-lived Olympic competitor.|$|E

5|$|Although no {{property}} in the village is <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> early 17th century, its layout reflects its development in medieval times as a planned village. Eight toft compartments are discernible {{to the west of}} Main Street, and the outline of the four surrounding common fields, now divided, may be identified from the pattern of dry stone walls. The fields were largely arable, providing the village with most of its food requirements, but are now farmed exclusively for pasture and hay. The village manor house was on land now occupied by Hebden Hall {{at the south end of}} Main Street.|$|E
5|$|Cheetah fossils {{found in}} the lower beds of the Olduvai Gorge site in {{northern}} Tanzania {{date back to the}} Pleistocene. The extinct species of Acinonyx are <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> cheetah, with the oldest known from the late Pliocene; these fossils are about three million years old. These species include Acinonyx pardinensis (Pliocene epoch), notably larger than the modern cheetah, and A.intermedius (mid-Pleistocene period). While the range of A.intermedius stretched from Europe to China, Apardinensis spanned over Eurasia as well as eastern and southern Africa. A variety of larger cheetah believed to have existed in Europe fell to extinction around half a million years ago.|$|E

He returned home to his wife Margaret and daughters Elizabeth and Matilda, now five years <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> last time he saw them. He applied for his military pension on October 6, 1866. Though Gwyn served in positions with a difficulty as high as major general, because he was only brevet, the payment he received would be reduced to the level of his highest non-brevet rank; which would be colonel, the position he effectively gave up on October 14, 1864.|$|E

5|$|Fonseca and the navy's {{high command}} {{were faced with}} two {{extremely}} unpalatable choices. They could use the government-controlled ships to attack and possibly destroy the rebel ships, but doing so would mean destroying three incredibly expensive ships that had received significant global attention and were—in their eyes—a crucial part of refashioning Brazil as a serious international power. Worse, {{there was a significant}} chance that the remaining Brazilian ships, all of which were smaller and much <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> ships controlled by the mutineers, would lose if it came to open combat. But by folding and giving into the rebel's list of demands—that is, demands from the underclass and broadly black naval crews—the elites would suffer an incredible embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|Globular {{clusters}} {{are found}} in the halo of a galaxy and contain considerably more stars and are much <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> less dense open clusters, which {{are found in}} the disk of a galaxy. Globular clusters are fairly common; there are about 150 to 158 currently known globular clusters in the Milky Way, with perhaps 10 to 20 more still undiscovered. These globular clusters orbit the Galaxy at radii of 40 kiloparsecs (130,000 light-years) or more. Larger galaxies can have more: Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, may have as many as 500. Some giant elliptical galaxies (particularly those at the centers of galaxy clusters) such as M87, have as many as 13,000 globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|If truly a gondwanathere, TNM02067 {{extends the}} known {{geographic}} {{range of the}} group {{to another part of}} Gondwana, the African mainland. The uncertain age of locality TZ-07 renders a precise assessment of the significance of TNM02067 difficult. It may well be <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> oldest previously known gondwanathere, the Campanian Gondwanatherium. It also has implications for the hypothesis that Africa was isolated from the rest of Gondwana from an early dateas early as the early Cretaceousand consequently had a fauna distinct from the rest of Gondwana for much of the Cretaceous, as it may be closely related to the sudamericids of South America, India, Madagascar, and Antarctica, a highly derived group.|$|E

5|$|In France, Champollion's success also {{produced}} enemies. Edmé-Francois Jomard was chief among them, and he spared no occasion to belittle Champollion's achievements behind his back, {{pointing out that}} Champollion {{had never been to}} Egypt and suggesting that really his lettre represented no major progress from Young's work. Jomard had been insulted by Champollion's demonstration of the young age of the Dendera zodiac, which he had himself proposed was as old as 15,000 years. This exact finding had also brought Champollion in the good graces of the Catholic Church which had been antagonized by the claims that Egyptian civilization might be <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> church-sanctioned chronology according to which the earth was only 6,000 years old.|$|E
5|$|Licancabur {{is part of}} the Central Volcanic Zone at {{the western}} edge of the Altiplano. Among the region's active volcanoes are Putana (erupted at the end of the 19th century), Llullaillaco (1868) and Lascar (1993). Other stratovolcanoes are Tacora, Nevados de Payachata, Isluga, Tata Sabaya, Ollague, Tocorpuri, Sairecabur and Socompa. The Central Volcanic Zone has more than 1,100 {{volcanic}} centres—many <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Pleistocene, since the area's prevailing arid climate prevented substantial erosion. During the Miocene, the area around Licancabur became the site of major ignimbrite-forming eruptions. Llano de Chajnantor (southeast of Licancabur) is the site of several observatories, including the Llano de Chajnantor Observatory.|$|E
5|$|R.C. Hazra {{suggests}} that the Mudgala Purana is <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Ganesha Purana, which he dates between 1100 and 1400. However, Phyllis Granoff finds problems with this relative dating and concludes that the Mudgala Purana {{was the last of}} the philosophical texts concerned with Ganesha. She bases her reasoning on the fact that, among other internal evidence, the Mudgala Purana specifically mentions the Ganesha Purana as one of the four Puranas (the Brahma, the Brahmanda, the Ganesha, and the Mudgala Puranas) which deal at length with Ganesha. While the kernel of the text must be old, it was interpolated until the 17th and 18th centuries as the worship of Ganapati became more important in certain regions. Another highly regarded scripture, the Ganapati Atharvashirsa, was probably composed during the 16th or 17th centuries.|$|E
