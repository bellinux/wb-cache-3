However, many engineering and engineering technology students are not made aware of these failures in their analysis or design courses. In the author’s structural analysis and design courses, students are required to research specific structural failures, and to report on these failures, detailing the causes of failure - illustrated with pictures and free-body diagrams, and any lessons learned. Articles on several structural failures are posted regularly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>website</b> to draw the students’ attention to these failures and their consequences, as well as any lessons learnt; discussions of these failures <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>website</b> discussion forum is also strongly encouraged. Our hypothesis is that studying specific structural failures has a positive impact on students’ learning experiences. To verify this hypothesis, an end-of-term student survey was conducted in two structural design courses where failure case studies were used. Analysis of the survey results indicates a positive impact of failure case studies on students’ educational experiences and awareness of ethical issues. The use of failure case studies in more engineering technology courses is also recommended...|$|E

We used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) developed by [1] as the model for investigating the usage of <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>website.</b> TAM proposes that perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEU) are key determinants of usage of a particular technology or system. The regression analysis results indicate that the two constructs were able to explain 49 % of the variation in the usage of <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>website.</b> Perceived usefulness (β = 0. 423, p< 0. 01) was the more influential predictor of usage with perceived ease of use (β = 0. 371, p< 0. 01) also significant.

F 2 F students stated that online learning is suitable for people who work and have no time to come to the campus, while they have no time limitations and can reach campus on a daily basis. Both DL and F 2 F students presented similar statements regarding the importance of managing information. They stated that effective online learning relies on the organization of the course website. For example: When I was asked to perform a task, it is easy for me to find the information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>website.</b> For example, for the conformity assignment, I used the lecture notes and the related articles … all the information was presented online in an orderly way, and in my opinion this arrangement is very convenient.

We also identified a third component: ‘information management’, which was not yet indicated in the literature. Similar to previous studies, in this study we found that efficient resource management is critical for successful online learning (Hussein-Farraj et al., 2012; Selim, 2007).

Although <b>the</b> usage of <b>course</b> <b>websites</b> are common in the West, but in a developing country like Malaysia, it is not the norm but the exception. This research builds on previous research done in Malaysian by looking at the moderating role of prior experience in explaining usage of an Internet <b>course</b> <b>website.</b> Data was collected from second year business management students who are required to use <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>website</b> for their business research methods class. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) developed by Davis [I] was used as the model for investigating the usage of <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>website.</b> TAM proposes that perceived usefulness (PU) and per:ceived ease of use (PEU) are key determinants of usage of a particular technology or system. This research further extends the relationship to include prior experience as a moderator in this relationship. The regression analysis results indicate that the two constructs were able to explain 47. 8 % of the variation in the usage of <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>website.</b> Perceived usefulness (13 = 0. 45, p<O,Ol) was the more influential predictor of usage with perceived ease of use (13 = 0. 34, p<O.

This study aimed to explore the sources of online students&#x 0027; {{information overload}} and offer suggestions for increasing students&#x 0027; cognitive resources for learning. Participants were 12 graduate students from two online courses in the United States. Their learning experiences in both online discussions and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>website</b> were explored through semi-structured interviews.

The findings suggest that varied learner characteristics led some students to be more susceptible than others to information overload.

From a theoretical perspective, generalizable social psychological theory may be developed and tested in research concerning sexual behavior. From a practical perspective, social psychological knowledge may be applied to ameliorate problematic aspects of sexual behavior and accentuate positive aspects of such behaviour. In accord with these theoretical and practical concerns, social psychologists have worked to develop conceptual models of factors that influence human sexual behavior and to apply social psychological knowledge to reduce sex-related problems and increase sex-related positive outcomes. This seminar on the social psychology of human sexual behavior will involve lectures, readings, class discussions, and student presentations focusing on history, ethics, methodology, theory, and selected content areas that are significant in this field of study. Acquisition of foundational knowledge in selected areas of the social psychology of sexual behavior is a primary objective of this course. Evaluation is based on clas...|$|E
