5|$|An <b>official</b> <b>inspection</b> in October 1950 {{reported}} {{that it would not}} be difficult to improve the old road into a reasonable track, which would then have a better chance of attracting assistance from Main Roads. The Mandurah Road Board spent £1200 on the road, while the Harvey Road Board requested a £500 grant from Main Roads for their portion of the road. Two years later little progress had been made, and Main Roads therefore refused to fund feeder roads to connect to Old Coast Road. By May 1952, works had halted as Main Roads believed that the existing, winding route around the estuary was too prone to flooding. Settlers in the area recalled it never flooding previously, and the Mandurah Road Board was concerned that should a new road be built, they would still have to maintain the old road for access to properties. The road was inspected by the Premier, Deputy-Commissioner of Main Roads J. D. Leach, and the district engineer H. A. Smith. They indicated that a new road would likely closely follow the old road, but that a detailed survey would be needed. Nearby limestone deposits would be suitable for the road's foundation, with the cost estimated at £11 per chain.|$|E
5|$|As of 2011, {{there were}} 335 mares and 51 stallions {{registered}} with the Irish registry, which included 59 new foals that year. Herd numbers have steadily increased since registrations began in 2005. These numbers make the Kerry Bog Pony third in population numbers among Irish breeds, behind the Connemara pony and the Irish Draught. Despite the increasing numbers, the breed is still considered to be critically endangered by the Equus Survival Trust. The horses are administered by the Kerry Bog Pony Co-Operative Society of Ireland (formerly the Kerry Bog Pony Society), {{which is based in}} Ireland with a branch in Great Britain. Inspections are required before ponies are allowed into the studbook. The book is divided into four classes: Class 1 ponies meet all requirements, Class 2 ponies do not meet the height requirement, Class 3 ponies do not meet the color requirements, and Class 4 ponies have yet to submit to an <b>official</b> <b>inspection.</b> The breed association has hosted an annual breed show and sale in Glenbeigh, County Kerry since 2007.|$|E

40|$|This essay aims {{to analyse}} two {{different}} forms of contemporary stories: pupils' and adults' audits {{of what goes on}} in classroom life. This was done by making a distinction between unofficial and <b>official</b> <b>inspections.</b> In the essay, I show that unofficial inspections are carried out by pupils, most likely with the aim of providing those of us outside the classrooms with real time movies to inform us about what takes place during life in classrooms. I go on to show that pupils highlight aspects of the complex everyday life in classrooms in a different way than the <b>official</b> <b>inspections,</b> which are performed by adult officials from agencies such as the Swedish Schools Inspectorate {{and are more likely to}} be understood as frozen snapshots. In analysing this issue, the stories of everyday classroom life, this essay highlights sixteen differences between unofficial and <b>official</b> <b>inspections.</b> These differences relate to who is carrying out the inspection, how the inspection was conducted, what the inspection focused on, when the inspection took place, and why. The analysis also highlight eight similarities between unofficial and <b>official</b> <b>inspections.</b> These relate to what was being observed, the benefit of the inspections and the motives behind the observation. The essay concludes with arguments regarding observations by unofficial audits supplementing and adding other qualities than the official one, by indicating secondary and tertiary qualities of a different intentional depth...|$|R

Previously to taking leave of a place that had become endeared to him by so many associations and interests, Mr. Woolston determined to take the Anne, hiring her of the government for that purpose--Governor Pennock condescendingly deciding that the public interests would not suffer by the arrangement--and going in her once more through the colony, on a tour of private, if not of <b>official</b> <b>inspection.</b> Bridget, Heaton, Anne, and Captain Betts, were of the party; the children being left at the crater, in proper custody.|$|E

HFSO is responsible for assessing risks relating to concrete events, furthermore by analysing the data of annual <b>official</b> <b>inspections</b> concerning various agricultural, technological, environmental and biological contaminants, pesticide residues and natural toxic substances in raw and processed food.

Eight months later the line was {{extended}} a further half mile to reach Pan Lane. However, the final half-mile from there to Newport station did not open until 1879. Four years of poor connections in Newport meant not enough passengers or freight had been attracted to the line, and the company passed into receivership in 1880. At this point, it was bought by the Cowes & Newport/Ryde & Newport company, who were legally renamed as the Isle of Wight Central Railway.|$|R

5000|$|Like many {{competitors}} in the German intercity bus market, Flixbus has been accused by parts of the media of subcontracting services with conditions which cannot reasonably be fulfilled, leading to low salaries and drivers working excessive hours. Critics point out that drivers must clean the buses or sell snacks during what is deemed [...] "free time" [...] to avoid exceeding limits for time at the wheel. On the other hand, <b>official</b> <b>inspections</b> have found that resting, driving and working hours in the market were much better than some media reports had suggested. Large providers in particular, who purchase services from contractors {{were found to be}} taking responsibility by monitoring compliance with social and legal standards. A survey by German public banks also showed that SME coach operators have improved their profitability since market deregulation, despite tough price competition and that market deregulation had led to a better utilization of their fleet.|$|R
