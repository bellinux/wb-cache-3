40|$|Methylation {{of certain}} lysine {{residues}} in the N-terminal tails of core histone proteins in nucleosome is of fundamental {{importance in the}} regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. Such histone modification is catalyzed by protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs). PKMTs contain a conserved SET domain in {{almost all of the}} cases and may transfer one to three methyl groups from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to the ε-amino group of the target lysine residue. Here, quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical molecular dynamics and free-energy simulations are performed on human PKMT SET 7 / 9 and its mutants to understand two outstanding questions for the reaction catalyzed by PKMTs: the mechanism for deprotonation of positively charged methyl lysine (lysine) and <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> specificity. The results of the simulations suggest that Tyr- 335 (an absolute conserved residue in PKMTs) may play the role as the general base for the deprotonation after dissociation of AdoHcy (S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine) and before binding of AdoMet. It is shown that conformational changes could bring Y 335 to the target methyl lysine (lysine) for proton abstraction. This mechanism provides an explanation why methyl transfers could be catalyzed by PKMTs processively. The free-energy profiles for methyl transfers are reported and analyzed for wild type and certain mutants (Y 305 F and Y 335 F) and the active-site interactions that are of importance for the enzyme's function are discussed. The results of the simulations provide important insights into the catalytic process and lead {{to a better understanding of}} experimental observations concerning the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> specificity for PKMTs...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper proposes an {{approach}} to accurately localize the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> quality drifts, in a flexible manufacturing system (FMS). The failure propagation mechanism in a production process is proposed based on the relationships between failure sources to explain the failure propagation following production flow. The logical diagnosis model is used to reduce the search space of suspected equipment in the production flow; however, it does not help in accurately localizing the faulty equipment. In the proposed approach, we model this reduced search space as a Bayesian network that uses historical data to compute conditional probabilities for each suspected equipment. This approach helps in making accurate decisions on localizing the cause for product quality drifts as either one of the equipment in production flow or product itself...|$|E
40|$|Protein {{arginine}} methyltransferases (PRMTs) catalyze {{the transfer}} of the methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to arginine residues. There are three types of PRMTs (I, II and III) that produce different methylation products, including asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) and monomethylarginine (MMA). Since these different methylations can lead to different biological consequences, understanding the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> specificity of PRMTs is of considerable interest. In this article, the quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) and free energy simulations are performed to study SDMA catalyzed by the Type II PRMT 5 on the basis of experimental observation that the dimethylated product is generated through a distributive fashion. The simulations have identified some important interactions and proton transfers during the catalysis. Similar to the cases involving Type I PRMTs, a conserved Glu residue (Glu 435) in PRMT 5 is suggested to function as general base catalyst based on the result of the simulations. Moreover, our results show that PRMT 5 has an energetic preference for the first methylation on Nη 1 followed by the second methylation on a different ω-guanidino nitrogen of arginine (Nη 2). The first and second methyl transfers are estimated to have free energy barriers of 19 – 20 and 18 – 19 kcal/mol respectively. The computer simulations suggest a distinctive catalytic mechanism of symmetric dimethylation that seems to be different from asymmetric dimethylation...|$|E

From those five locations, until the year of 2001, there are 2 of markets realized with the bad result; there was only 1 (one) market that could be functioned, there was Pasar Tanah Baru. This condition worrying to the succeed of {{the building of the}} 3 latter locations, they are, Bubulak Pamoyangan and Katulampa. Meanwhile, there should be a research in order to reveal the causes of the increase or the decrease of Pasar Tanah Baru itself, to prevent the failure happened in planning and building the others traditional market at the widening area of Kota Bogor. This research will be developed on the basis of research question as follows : (I) what is the factors that cause the development of the market, and (2) between those factors, what factor is the most influential to the development of Pasar Tanah Baru The purpose of this research is to study the determining factor as supporter to the development of Pasar Tanah Baru, as a guideline of the building of new traditional market at the widening area of Kota Bogor, while the target are : (a) determined the possibly factors to the building of traditional market, (b) to compare and apply those factors at the Pasar Traditional Tanah Baru, and (c) to analyze the relationship/ the influence between those factors to the development of Pasco- Tanah Baru or the correlation between those factors itself, and also to recommend the building planning of new traditional market at the widening area of Kota Bogor. The analysis applied in this research is consisting of qualitative analysis that supported by quantitative analysis by using multiple linear regression statistic model of backward elimination. According to the prior literature and survey, determined that the facto s that will be analyzedfrom the spacing factor (spatial), the customer and seller's behavior involved in the trading activities at Pasar Tanah Barn. The spatial factors are including: threshold population, market area, agglomeration, the 'Minium competition and median location. Customer's behavior that will be analyzed are including : extend range, the role of public transportation, shopping ammo); market interest, income per month, daily expenditure, promotion and public participation. While, according to the seller side, that will be studied are : the type of products, total of shops, selling experiences, the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>product,</b> the way to have the product, the total capital and the total of transaction value. From the analysis as explained above, explained that the market area, agglomeration and threshold population variables form the vision of spatial, the readiness ofpublic transportation medium and the total of rupiah values that expend from the vision of product types and the total of transaction values that occurred from the vision of the sellers are the influential factors to the development of Pasar Tanah Baru, even though in the reality according to the research; that development itself was not reach a good development yet. Then, the result of the analysis will be the references to review the tentative planning of given market location. Actuallyfrom the three locations of the market there is Pasar Katulampa that only could comply all criteria given and one another is Pasco- Pamoyangan and Bubulak that still be considered not comply the criteria, especially in agglomeration and the readiness of public transportation facilities. The increasing of Pasar Tanah Baru development was recommended in the building of the shortcut to the housing location in Kelurahan Tegal Gundil and also restructuring the route of its public transportation. From the others 3 planning of traditional market location, Pasar Katulampa was recommended to be followed up to the building process, while the others locations should be postpone or be moved to other locations that couldfulfill the requirements.

40|$|Products in {{a market}} are often branded with {{geographical}} names to get individual tint and indicate a place <b>of</b> their <b>origin.</b> Originating from a certain geographical region can sometimes be an attractive additional value for a consumer, {{on account of the}} established reputation or because of other reasons influencing his buying decision. Geographical names became therefore an instrument of commercial marketing which is also used to gain a higher market share. Legislations of many countries laid down protection of geographical names in consideration of the above, indicating at point <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>products.</b> The author describes the way of regulating protection of geographical names in selected countries with due regard paid to the Federal Republic of Germany and France. Legal status of geographical names is differantiated. Separate regulation is particularly reserved to the so called brand names <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> (appellations <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> appellation d'origine, ursprungsbezeichnung). Normative basis for protection of names indicating at <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> or services from a. certain geographical region in Poland is art. 4 of the Unfair Competition Act of 1926. According to the cited provision geographical names designating <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> are subject <b>of</b> common right of all persons operating firms on a given territory. In case of illegal usage of geographical names these persons and enterpreneurs selling these products are allowed several claims mentioned in the Act. The author discusses a nature of rights allowed to subjects mentioned in the Act reaching the conclusion that it is here a case of sui generis imperative rights. Their peculiar character {{lies in the fact that}} a circle of entitled persons is not defined and that these rights are unlimited in time and their formation and lasting are not conditioned by performing any formalities. Next, the author discusses conditions and possibilities of using geographical names in character of other distinguishing signs (brands <b>of</b> <b>products</b> in particular). Protection of geographical names is regulated in many legal acts of international range. The following belong to them: a) Paris Convention of 1883 on the protection of industrial property, b) Madrid Agreement of 1891 on prosecution of feigned or misleading designations <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> c) Lisbon Agreement of 1958 on international registration <b>of</b> names <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> d) bilateral international treaties.
