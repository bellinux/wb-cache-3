25|$|The intercepting sewers, {{constructed}} between 1859 and 1865, {{were fed}} by 450 miles (720km) of main sewers that, in turn, conveyed {{the contents of}} some 13,000 miles (21,000km) of smaller local sewers. Construction of the interceptor system required 318 million bricks, 2.7 million cubic metres of excavated earth and 670,000 cubic metres of concrete. Gravity allowed the sewage to flow eastwards, but {{in places such as}} Chelsea, Deptford and Abbey Mills, pumping stations were built to raise the water and provide sufficient flow. Sewers north of the Thames feed into the Northern <b>Outfall</b> <b>Sewer,</b> which fed into a major treatment works at Beckton. South of the river, the Southern <b>Outfall</b> <b>Sewer</b> extended to a similar facility at Crossness. With only minor modifications, Bazalgette's engineering achievement remains the basis for sewerage design up into the present day.|$|E

500|$|By June 1856 Bazalgette {{completed}} his definitive plans, which provided for small, local sewers about [...] in diameter to feed {{into a series}} of larger sewers until they drained into main outflow pipes [...] high. A Northern and Southern <b>Outfall</b> <b>Sewer</b> were planned to manage the waste for each side of the river. London was mapped into high-, middle- and low-level areas, with a main sewer servicing each; a series of pumping stations was planned to remove the waste towards the east of the city. Bazalgette's plan was based on that of Foster, but was larger in scale, and allowed for more of a rise in population than Foster's– from 3 to 4.5million. Bazalgette submitted his plans to Sir Benjamin Hall, the First Commissioner of Works. Hall had reservations about the outfalls—the discharge points of waste outlets into other bodies of water—from the sewers, which he said were still within the bounds of the capital, and were therefore unacceptable. During the ongoing discussions Bazalgette refined and modified his plans, in line with Hall's demands. In December 1856 Hall submitted the plans to a group of three consultant engineers, Captain Douglas Strutt Galton of the Royal Engineers, James Simpson, an engineer with two water companies, and Thomas Blackwood, the chief engineer on the Kennet and Avon Canal. The trio reported back to Hall in July 1857 with proposed changes to the positions of the outfall, which he passed on to the MBW in October. The new proposed discharge points were to be open sewers, running [...] beyond the positions proposed by the board; the cost of their plans was to be over £5.4million, considerably more than the maximum estimate of Bazalgette's plan, which was £2.4million. In February 1858 a general election saw the fall of Lord Palmerston's Whig government, which was replaced by Lord Derby's second Conservative ministry; Lord John Manners replaced Hall, and Benjamin Disraeli was appointed Leader of the House of Commons and Chancellor of the Exchequer.|$|E
2500|$|The works {{covered a}} [...] site {{to the south}} of the Northern <b>Outfall</b> <b>Sewer,</b> between Woolwich Manor Way and the Thames. The company had {{considered}} several sites for the works. The site to the west of Barking Creek was selected as it was possible to build deep water piers in the Thames, enabling direct unloading from steam colliers bringing coal from mines in the North-East of England. There were two piers, for importing coal and exporting by-products. In the 1930s an annual average of a million tons of coal mainly from Durham was unloaded at the main pier, with a further 750,000 tons transhipped to barges for other works. The GLCC had a fleet of seventeen coastal colliers ranging from 1,200 to 2,841 gross register tons, and also chartered larger ships as needed. At this time the plant had a coal storage capacity of 250,000 tons.|$|E

5|$|The smell, and people's {{fears of}} its {{possible}} effects, prompted {{action from the}} local and national administrators who had been considering possible solutions for the problem. The authorities accepted a proposal from the civil engineer Joseph Bazalgette to move the effluent eastwards along a series of interconnecting sewers that sloped towards outfalls beyond the metropolitan area. Work on high-, mid- and low-level systems for the new Northern and Southern <b>Outfall</b> <b>Sewers</b> started {{at the beginning of}} 1859 and lasted until 1875. To aid the drainage, pumping stations were placed to lift the sewage from lower levels into higher pipes. Two of the more ornate stations, Abbey Mills in Stratford and Crossness on the Erith Marshes, are listed for protection by English Heritage. Bazalgette's plan introduced the three embankments to London in which the sewers ran—the Victoria, Chelsea and Albert Embankments.|$|R
5000|$|Availability of {{reliable}} pumps allows lifting accumulations {{of water into}} gravity sewers from collection sumps in excavations like mines or building foundations; {{but the cost of}} pumping surface runoff discourages use of lift stations in storm drains or combined sewers. The capitalized cost of operation and maintenance of lift stations and emergency power supplies usually justifies considerable first cost for excavation or tunneling to build a gravity sewer. Sewage treatment is most efficient at centralized locations; and pumping is often required to lift sewage from lower elevations to the sewage treatment plant headworks. Structures called regulators allow overflow into gravity <b>outfall</b> <b>sewers</b> when peak flow in combined sewers exceeds pumping capacity. Sanitary sewers are preferred for cost-effective pumping of sewage when treatment is required. Gravity sewers are preferred where grades are favorable, but lift stations often move sewage to sewage treatment plants.|$|R

40|$|Wastewater {{conveyance}} {{and treatment}} facilities, which include <b>outfall</b> <b>sewers,</b> manholes, and treatment works, {{are among the}} key constituents of a country's infrastructure. Most of these facilities are made of concrete due to its low production costs, versatility, inherent strength and durability under most conditions. However, under certain conditions, sewage that is conveyed through <b>outfall</b> <b>sewers</b> becomes septic and hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) gas is generated. When this gas is released from the sewage and absorbed onto the moist concrete sewer pipe walls, it is microbially converted by sulphide-oxidising bacteria to sulphuric acid (biogenic H 2 SO 4) which reacts with the acid-soluble components of concrete causing it to corrode. In principle, the biogenic H 2 SO 4 concrete corrosion mechanism entails simultaneous destruction of the calcium hydroxide (CH) in the hydrated cement paste (HCP) and substituting a larger molecule of calcium sulphate into the concrete matrix thus causing pressure and spalling of the adjacent concrete and aggregate particles. In addition, the calcium sulphate precipitates as gypsum which reacts with various aluminates to form secondary ettringite. These mechanisms lead {{to the loss of}} stiffness and strength, accompanied by expansion and cracking, and eventually transformation of the affected concrete matrix into a soft and pulpy non-cohesive layer. The biogenic concrete corrosion rate depends, inter alia, on the chemical composition of binders (cement and supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs)) and microstructural characteristics of concrete mixtures used in the manufacture of sewer pipes. The needed properties of concrete mixtures for sewer pipe applications can be determined by biogenic corrosion prediction models, such as the widely used deterministic (mechanistic) Life Factor Method (LFM). The service life of wastewater treatment facilities made of concrete depends on the input parameters in corrosion prediction models. The motivation behind the current study was based on the need to improve the ability to predict the design life of concrete sewers by improving the input parameters in the LFM, which is used in South Africa. The design life of concrete sewers in South Africa has traditionally been 40 years. The main objective of the current study was to characterise the microstructure of both Portland cement (PC) and calcium aluminate cement (CAC) based concrete mixtures that had been subjected to biogenic corrosion mechanisms in an operational sewer environment for approximately 127 months (10 ½ years); further, based on the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of attack, proposals were made to improve the LFM, for which the corrosion rate-controlling input parameter, referred to as alkalinity (or equivalent CaCO 3, as a summation for both binder and aggregate) is based on the characteristics of plain PC-based binder systems. In addition to the main objective above, a parallel study was undertaken to characterise parameters that influence biogenic concrete corrosion rates based on measurements taken in two sewer environments/sites in different geographical locations in South Africa. One of the study sites was the Virginia Experimental Sewer (VES) in Virginia, Free State Province, while the other site was a manhole within the Langa Pump Station in Cape Town, Western Cape Province. The VES consists of 900 mm diameter by 300 mm long concrete pipe samples made from both PC- and CAC-based (plain and blended) binder systems, the top 120 ° being cut to form 'lids', so that they are removable. The removable 'lids' enable scheduled observations and sample recovery to be undertaken. Moreover, the 'lids' also act as windows through which core samples can be placed in plastic baskets that are hung at certain sections in the sewer headspace, {{so that they can be}} accessed for monitoring...|$|R

It is so important that the more it is discussed the better, provided that the discussion leads to the adoption, and the early adoption, of the best means to ameliorate the present condition of things. To place the matter before you, allow me to make the following recapitulation from my official report to the Central Board of Health: The area of the city is 1, 270 acres; the population is about 25, 000; the number of houses is about 4, 500; the water supply is said to be equal to 65 gal. a day to each inhabitant, or 330 gal to each house. There are probably 400 houses with waterclosets, 600 with privies with moveable pails that are periodically emptied by the nightmen {{in the service of the}} corporation, and the remaining 3, 500 have ordinary privies, the cesspools of which are emptied at much longer intervals of time. The length of public sewers is not accurately known, but the greater part of the city is without underground drainage. The length of streets is about 37 miles. No plan of sewage treatment is at present proposed, but the <b>outfall</b> <b>sewers</b> are so arranged as to admit of the construction of depositing tanks and other works, should such at any time hereafter be found desirable. Various problems had to be solved before any complete system could be properly formulated.
