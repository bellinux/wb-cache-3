40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of platelet concentrate obtained from donor plasma in the local treatment of venous trophic ulcers. The study included 106 patients (92 women and 14 men) aged from 38 to 79 years with varicose disease of the lower extremities with the sixth stage of chronic venous insufficiency in accordance with the international clinical part of the CEAP classification. The main group included 51 patients who received donor plasma enriched with platelets (106 in 1 μl) in the local treatment. The control group consisted of 55 patients who, in the local treatment, were given <b>only</b> modern <b>dressings</b> in strict accordance with the modern concept of treatment of chronic wounds. The results of the treatment were evaluated after 10 days of medical intervention. The use of the platelet-rich donor plasma in the regional treatment of trophic ulcers of venous etiology stimulates the regeneration processes and initiates the formation of granulation tissue, epithelialization, and angiogenesis. A wide range of local therapeutic effects, stimulating the regeneration, allows reducing the treatment time, improving the quality of life of patients and reducing the cost of treatment...|$|R
40|$|Wound {{management}} has progressed significantly {{over the last}} five decades. This emanates from a greater understanding of wound healing, technological progression and improved clinical and scientific research. There are currently a plethora of absorbent dressings on the wound care market which claim {{to have the ability to}} manage exudates whilst encouraging healing. However, it is becoming clear, from analysing randomised controlled trials, that some of these absorbent dressings are not meeting their expectations when applied in a clinical setting. Many clinicians now feel that there should be more focus, not <b>only</b> on a <b>dressing's</b> ability to manage exudate efficiently, but on a dressing's ability to proactively encourage healing and thus exudate reduction will ensue. This paper proposes to critically review modern and emerging absorbent wound care dressings used to manage exuding wounds and discuses some advances in this are...|$|R
40|$|Background Various focal {{heating devices}} are popular in Korea under the {{cultural}} {{influence of the}} traditional ondol under-floor method of home heating. These devices can cause severe burn-like injuries resulting from device malfunction or extended with low heat contact. In addition to injuries under these high heat contact, burns can be occurred by low heat exposure with prolonged periods despite the devices are properly functioning. In order to develop strategies to reduce the duration of periods of illness due to low-temperature burns, we analyzed and compared treatment methods and therapeutic periods {{for this type of}} injury. Methods This retrospective study included 43 patients burned under low heat conditions. Patients were divided into an operative group and a conservative group. The patients in the operative group underwent at least one surgical excision, and were further subdivided into early and late visit groups. The conservative group was treated <b>only</b> with <b>dressings.</b> We compared the treatment periods between the operative group and the conservative group, and also compared the preparation periods and treatment periods between the two operative groups. Results The average treatment period was significantly shorter in the operative group (P= 0. 02). In the early visit operative group, both wound preparation and treatment were briefer than in the late visit group. Conclusions We recommend that early proper burn care and early surgical intervention, including appropriate excision, are feasible ways to reduce the treatment period of lowtemperature burn patients. © 2015 The Korean Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons...|$|R

40|$|In 1997, first hulless {{cultivar}} Akt {{was taken}} into regional distribution in Poland, and in 2002 the next one Polar. Field experiments were conducted in Agricultural Experimental Station Lipnik near Stargard Szczecinski 2000 - 2001. Two cultivars of oat (hulless Akt and hulled Bajka), 4 sowing rates (400, 530, 660, 790 seeds per m 2), 3 variants of seed dressing at recommended rate (Sarfun T 450 FS systematical-contact dressing with active substances karbendazym and tiuram, Dithane 455 SC - contact dressing with active substance mankozeb and control. Seed dressings were used. The increasing of sowing rate from 400 to 790 seeds per m 2 in 2000 year caused significant increase of grain yield irrespective of cultivar. In the following year, when weather conditions were favorable for vegetation period, increasing sowing rates did not significantly influence grain yield. Grain yield of Bajka was higher than for hulless Akt. After taking hull in Bajka cultivar under consideration and subtracting it from the yield. Yields of both cultivars were similar, and significant differences were observed only {{in the first year}} of the experiment. Together with increasing sowing rate, also number of plants after germination and number of panicels per 1 m 2 increased. Both cultivars reacted on increasing of plant density by reduction of grains in panicle Productive tillering in present experiment decrease together with sowing rate for both cultivars. Number of plants per m 2 and number of panicles per m 2 are significantly diversified for types only during the first year of the experiment. Weight of 1000 grains depends on agronomical and meteorological conditions. It did not change in 2000 at different sowing rate. Significant differences were observed in case of weight of 1000 grains in 2001, <b>only.</b> Seed <b>dressings</b> used in the experiment did not influence investigated features, except in hulless grains in 2000. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the factors affecting the outcome of treatment of burns patients admitted to the Burns Intensive Care Unit (BICU) of the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Kumasi, Ghana. Information on patients admitted to the BICU from February 2001 to January 2006 was recorded. Parameters recorded included: admission record and demographics, causes of the injury, burned surface area, laboratory investigations, treatment regime, and record of discharge/death. The data were analysed with SPSS version 12. 0 and Spearman's rank correlation. A total of 826 patients were recorded; males (n = 492, 60 %) outnumbered females (n= 334, 40 %). The mean age was 10. 5 ± 5 yr, the majority (n = 441, 53 %) in the range 0 - 10 yr. Flame burns (n = 587, 71 %), scalds (n = 209, 25 %), and chemicals (n = 19, 2 %) were the three significant causes of burn injuries. The mean range of the total body surface area (TBSA) burned was 11 - 20 %; 94 % (n = 775) had up to 60 % TBSA; 64 % (n = 527) had <b>only</b> wound <b>dressings</b> for treatment; 21 % (n = 174) had early excision with skin grafting, while 15 % (n = 125) had delayed excision with skin grafting. The majority (n = 563, 68 %) of the patients stayed for less than 10 days after admission. The mortality rate fell over the years, decreasing drastically between 2001 (20. 4 %) and 2002 (8. 6 %) and remaining at single digit level in 2003 (7. 6 %), 2004 (7. 9 %), and 2005 (7. 4 %). The factors affecting the mortality trends were proper case management, increases in the number of professional medical personnel, and their greater dedication...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: Although {{several factors}} {{contribute}} to wound healing, bacterial infections {{and the presence of}} biofilm can significantly affect healing. Despite that this clearly indicates that therapies should address biofilm in wounds, only few wound care products have been evaluated for their antibiofilm effect. For this reason, we developed a rapid quantification approach to investigate the efficacy of wound care products on wounds infected with Staphylococcus spp. METHODS AND RESULTS: An in vitro chronic wound infection model was used in which a fluorescent Staph. aureus strain was used to allow the rapid quantification of the bacterial burden after treatment. A good correlation was observed between the fluorescence signal and the bacterial counts. When evaluated in this model, several commonly used wound dressings and wound care products inhibited biofilm formation resulting in a decrease between one and seven log CFU per biofilm compared with biofilm formed in the absence of products. In contrast, most <b>dressings</b> <b>only</b> moderately affected mature biofilms. CONCLUSION: Our model allowed the rapid quantification of the bacterial burden after treatment. However, the efficacy of treatment varied between the different types of dressings and/or wound care products. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our model can be used to compare the efficacy of wound care products to inhibit biofilm formation and/or eradicate mature biofilms. In addition, the results indicate that treatment of infected wounds should be started as soon as possible and that novel products with more potent antibiofilm activity are needed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLocally {{infected}} {{wounds and}} wounds colonised with multidrug-resistant bacteria are commonly treated with local antimicrobial agents. Recently, wound dressings {{have been introduced}} into clinical practice that reduces bacteria by adsorbing bacteria on the dressing surface by a hydrophobic effect. Our aim was to investigate, whether this hydrophobic effect is <b>only</b> present in <b>dressings</b> coated with dialkyl carbamoyl chloride (DACC) or also in other modern wound dressings. To determine the hydrophobicity of the dressing surface contact angle measurements were performed. In addition, for selected wound dressings, the bacteria eliminating effect of the wound dressings for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were measured. 31 of the 34 wound dressings presented with a hydrophobic surface. The reduction factor (RF) of one wound dressing without coating was 1. 6 for MRSA and RF 2. 1 for P. aeruginosa. One with a DACC coated dressing showed a RF of 0. 7 (MRSA) and 1. 2 (P. aeruginosa). The RF of a wound dressing that releases silver ions was 6. 1 for MRSA and 7. 5 for P. aeruginosa respectively. The results show that both uncoated and with DACC coated wound dressings can have hydrophobic surfaces. These hydrophobic dressings are able to adsorb bacteria onto their surface and consequently remove them from the wound. However, the RF for wound dressings that release silver ions is significantly higher. Depending {{on the degree of}} contamination, these results can {{have an effect on the}} clinical decision to choose certain products. We assume that for e. g. infected or critically colonised wounds, wound dressings with a hydrophobic effect may not be sufficient to significantly improve the microbiological wound condition. However, this assumption has to be verified in clinical studies...|$|R
