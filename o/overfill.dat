25|$|BART trains travel between San Francisco and Oakland {{through an}} {{underwater}} tube structure. The tube {{is composed of}} welded plate steel segments. Each oval outer section carries two inner train tubes of circular cross section and a central rectangular access and rescue tunnel, with the void between elements filled with concrete. The segments were sunk into a ditch dredged through bay mud and covered with rock fill, and then pumped free of water upon completion, making the resulting tube somewhat buoyant, but held in place with a rock <b>overfill.</b> Subsequent seismic analysis indicated {{the possibility that the}} <b>overfill</b> could fail due to agitation, allowing the buoyant tube to float upward, misaligning the tracks and possibly overstressing the bolted connections. This potential problem has been addressed by vibratory compaction of the <b>overfill</b> covering the tube. Additional stabilization includes the driving of large pilings and the connection of additional restraints.|$|E
40|$|The goal of endodontic {{treatment}} {{is to keep}} the teeth as long as possible in the mouth. The obturation process in the root canal {{is one of the most}} important processes in endodontic treatment. The purpose of this article is to explain that <b>overfilling</b> is an influencing factor to the success of endodontic treatment. It has been widely known that <b>overfilling</b> should be avoided during an obturation process. <b>Overfilling</b> of the root canal is indicated only in cases which will be followed by apicoectomy, when the foreign material is removed. Accidental <b>overfilling</b> may occur with soft material (for example, certain pastes and cements) or with solid material (such as gutta-percha or silver cones). Such <b>overfilling</b> may cause an unnecessary mechanical and chemical irritation, which hinders the repair of periapical tissue, and thus, diminishes the probability of a successful endodontic treatment prognosis. Many things could cause <b>overfilling,</b> which makes <b>overfilling</b> unpleasant feeling for the patient such as severe pain, periapical lesion, gingival discoloration, periodontal ligament breakage, or even paresthesia. There are several ways to overcome this root canal <b>overfilling,</b> from the conventional endodontic treatment up to endodontic surgery. The main conclusion from this article is to avoid <b>overfilling</b> and the importance of clinicians’ compliance to the right procedures. </span...|$|R

25|$|Docetaxel is a {{white powder}} and is the active {{ingredient}} available in 20mg and 80mg Taxotere single-dose vials of concentrated anhydrous docetaxel in polysorbate 80. The solution is a clear brown-yellow containing 40mg docetaxel and 1040mg polysorbate 80 per mL. 20mg Taxotere is distributed in a blister carton containing one single-dose vial of Taxotere (docetaxel) preparation in 0.5 mL sterile pyrogen-free anhydrous polysorbate 80, and a single dose Taxotere solvent vial containing 1.5 mL 13% ethanol in saline to be combined and diluted in a 250 mL infusion bag containing 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% glucose for administration. 80mg Taxotere is supplied identically but with 2.0 mL polysorbate 80 and 6.0 mL 13% ethanol in saline. The docetaxel and solvent vials are combined to give a solution of 10mg/mL and the required dose is drawn from this solution. Vials have an <b>overfill</b> to compensate for liquid loss during preparation, foaming, adhesion to vial walls and the dead volume. 20mg vials may be stored for 24 months below 25°C away from light and 80mg vials for 26 months in the same conditions.|$|E
25|$|A tube of {{particular}} structural, seismic, economic, and political {{interest is the}} BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) transbay tube. This tube was constructed {{at the bottom of}} San Francisco Bay through an innovative process. Rather than pushing a shield through the soft bay mud, the tube was constructed on land in sections. Each section consisted of two inner train tunnels of circular cross section, a central access tunnel of rectangular cross section, and an outer oval shell encompassing the three inner tubes. The intervening space was filled with concrete. At the bottom of the bay a trench was excavated and a flat bed of crushed stone prepared to receive the tube sections. The sections were then floated into place and sunk, then joined with bolted connections to previously-placed sections. An <b>overfill</b> was then placed atop the tube to hold it down. Once completed from San Francisco to Oakland, the tracks and electrical components were installed. The predicted response of the tube during a major earthquake was likened to be as that of a string of (cooked) spaghetti in a bowl of gelatin dessert. To avoid overstressing the tube due to differential movements at each end, a sliding slip joint was included at the San Francisco terminus under the landmark Ferry Building.|$|E

[...] The increase in blood pressure can improve performance by 15% and is most effective in the endurance sports such as cross-country skiing. [...] To increase blood pressure athletes will deliberately cause trauma to limbs below a spinal injury.

2500|$|The {{engineers}} of {{the construction}} consortium PBTB (Parsons Brinckerhoff-Tudor-Bechtel) used the best estimates of ground motion available at the time, now known to be insufficient given modern computational analysis methods and geotechnical knowledge. Unexpected settlement of the tube has reduced the amount of slip that can be accommodated without failure. These factors {{have resulted in the}} slip joint being designed too short to ensure survival of the tube under possible (perhaps even likely) large earthquakes in the region. To correct this deficiency the slip joint must be extended to allow for additional movement, a modification expected to be both expensive and technically and logistically difficult. Other retrofits to the BART tube include vibratory consolidation of the tube's <b>overfill</b> to avoid potential liquefying of the <b>overfill,</b> which has now been completed. (Should the <b>overfill</b> fail there is a danger of portions of the tube rising from the bottom, an event which could potentially cause failure of the section connections.) ...|$|E

50|$|Depending on the {{expected}} level and volume of rain water or runoff, French drains can be widened or also founded on 2 or 3 underground drain pipes. Multiple pipes also provide for redundancy, in case one pipe becomes <b>overfilled</b> or clogged by a rupture or {{defect in the}} piping. A pipe might become <b>overfilled</b> if it is on a side of the drain which receives a much larger volume of water, such as one pipe being closer to an uphill slope, or closer to a roofline that drips near the French drain. When a pipe becomes <b>overfilled,</b> water can seep sideways into a parallel pipe, {{as a form of}} load-balancing, so that neither pipe becomes slowed by air bubbles, as might happen in a full-pipe with no upper air space.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{cause of}} the fire was the <b>overfilling</b> of Tank 231. While no crude oil escaped from the tank {{as a result of}} being <b>overfilled,</b> large quantities of hydrocarbon vapors were trapped above the surface of the tank’s crude oil. As the quantity of crude oil increased, these hydrocarbon vapors were forced out of the tank’s vents and into the area of the No. 4 Boiler House where the initial flash occurred. The <b>overfilling</b> of the tank, in turn, resulted from a failure of the tanker’s personnel to properly monitor the quantity of crude oil being pumped to the tank. At approximately 6:02 a.m. {{in the wake of the}} first explosions and fire, the tanker terminated its pumping operations, left its Schuylkill River berth and relocated to the Gulf piers at Hog Island.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND ROTEM(®) {{test results}} can be {{affected}} by the citrate to blood ratio in the tested sample. <b>Overfilling</b> or underfilling specimen tubes can change this ratio. OBJECTIVES The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the impact of under- and <b>overfilling</b> citrate test tubes on ROTEM(®) EXTEM measurements. RESULTS Overall repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated significant differences of CT (p = 0. 004), CFT (p = 0. 005), A 5 (p = 0. 001), A 10 (p < 0. 001), and MCF (p < 0. 001). Pairwise comparison revealed that underfilling significantly altered the results of those parameters reflecting functional clot firmness (A 5, A 10, and MCF), while <b>overfilling</b> led to a prolongation of the CT results only. No differences were observed for alpha angle and maximum lysis. CONCLUSION Both underfilling and <b>overfilling</b> specimen tubes have significant influence on the results of the ROTEM(®) EXTEM test, although the small observed bias is likely of limited clinical relevance. However, it seems prudent to limit the maximum allowed difference in filling to less than ± 10 %. All ROTEM(®) operators should be aware of this pre-analytical variable...|$|R
40|$|The lack of {{constraints}} in {{ball mill}} {{capacity in the}} published ball mill models may result in unrealistic predictions of mill throughput. This paper presents an <b>overfilling</b> indicator for wet overflow discharge ball mills. The <b>overfilling</b> indicator {{is based on the}} slurry residence time in a given mill and given operational conditions. Mathematical descriptions of the method to estimate the volume-based residence time of slurry are presented. A database consisting of 121 sets of industrial overflow ball mill surveys worldwide was used to establish the pattern of the slurry residence time in the full scale operational overflow ball mills. According to the pattern, the residence time thresholds beyond which <b>overfilling</b> a ball mill is likely to occur were defined. For a ball mill with an internal diameter smaller than 5. 9 m, the volume-based residence time threshold is set at 2 min; and for a ball mill larger than 5. 9 m in diameter, the threshold is set at 1 min. In addition to being incorporated in ball mill models to warn of any unrealistic simulations, the <b>overfilling</b> indicator can also be utilised at ball mill operation sites to guide the mill throughput control and optimisation...|$|R
