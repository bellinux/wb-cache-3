5|$|After {{establishing}} Playboy Indonesia in 2006 Arnada {{became the}} center of controversy, as Islamic groups such as the Islamic Defenders Front protested the magazine as indecent– despite it not featuring any nudity. After an extended series of trials Arnada was convicted by the Supreme Court of Indonesia and sentenced to two years in prison, beginning in October 2010. He was released the following June, when the court reversed its decision. In 2012 Arnada was nominated for a Citra Award for Best Director for his film Rumah di Seribu Ombak, based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> he had written in prison.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of the film's 175-day run, novelist S. P. Chary accused the film of being based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> that he had written and published as a serial under the title Chanderi in a monthly magazine in 1998. He demanded that filmmakers compensate him for using his idea without consent, and threatened to take legal action if the producers did not heed his demands, or remade the film in another language. He added that he deserved to be credited for the story and alleged that Allu Arjun and Allu Sirish were trying to postpone his acknowledgment by discussing the issue with him.|$|E

Whereas Madhouse based the previous film <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel,</b> the studio {{was given the}} chance to create the next film. Director Mamoru Hosoda selected a story for both people with family and those without having a family. Production of Summer Wars commenced in 2006.|$|E
5|$|As he was {{completing}} work on Dubliners in 1906, Joyce considered {{adding another}} story featuring a Jewish advertising canvasser called Leopold Bloom {{under the title}} Ulysses. Although he did not pursue the idea further at the time, he eventually commenced work <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> using both the title and basic premise in 1914. The writing was completed in October 1921. Three more months were devoted to working on the proofs of the book before Joyce halted work shortly before his self-imposed deadline, his 40th birthday (2 February 1922).|$|E
5|$|François Truffaut as Claude Lacombe, a French {{government}} {{scientist in}} charge of UFO-related activities in the United States. Gérard Depardieu, Philippe Noiret, Jean-Louis Trintignant and Lino Ventura were considered for the role. Internationally renowned as a film director, this was Truffaut's only acting role in a film he did not direct {{as well as his}} only role in an English language film. During filming, Truffaut used his free time to write the script for The Man Who Loved Women. He also worked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> titled The Actor, a project he abandoned.|$|E

This would both satisfy his longstanding interest in the Native Americans of the West, and provide a subject that might {{be of interest to}} publishers. In May, Marquis applied to the Civil Service Commission. While waiting, he began work <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel,</b> Boute, an unfinished story based on his wartime experiences. In June, Marquis was appointed agency physician to the Northern Cheyenne. He arrived in the agency village of Lame Deer, Montana, in early July.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Rome {{to cover}} the Turkish War of Independence for the International News Service, Bryant lived with Bullitt in a villa in Constantinople in early 1923. While Bullitt worked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel,</b> It's Not Done, {{published}} in 1926 and dedicated to Bryant, she covered events related {{to the rise of}} Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the first president of the Republic of Turkey. From her base in Turkey, she ventured to Palermo to interview the deposed king of Greece, Constantine I, and to Athens to interview his son, George II. Shortly thereafter, Bryant suspended her journalistic career to focus on family matters.|$|E
5|$|Microbes {{feature in}} many highly dramatized films. Hollywood {{was quick to}} exploit the {{possibilities}} of deadly disease, mass infection and drastic government reaction, starting as early as 1922 with Nosferatu, in which a Dracula-like figure, Count Orlok, sleeps in unhallowed ground contaminated with the Black Death, which he brings with him wherever he goes. Another classic film, Ingmar Bergman's 1957 The Seventh Seal, deals with the plague theme very differently, with the grim reaper directly represented by an actor in a hood. More recently, the 1971 The Andromeda Strain, based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> by Michael Crichton, portrayed an extraterrestrial microbe contaminating the Earth.|$|E

Once again they worked with director Martin Ritt, their seventh project together, and Sally Field, who had played the titular lead role in Norma Rae. Despite Murphy's Romance being well-received (it was nominated for two Academy Awards) {{it would be another}} five years before Frank and Ravetch wrote another screenplay; hired by Martin Ritt, the couple wrote the screenplay for Stanley & Iris, loosely based on the novel Union Street.|$|E

She is now a {{professor}} of humanities at New York University. They have two sons, Kanishk and Ishaan. Ishaan is a former senior editor at Time magazine, and now writes on foreign affairs for The Washington Post. Kanishk is a former editor at Open Democracy, {{and is the author}} of the highly praised short story collection Swimmer Among The Stars and he is working <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> in New York. Kanishk also served as associate editor at openDemocracy.net 2006-09. Later Tharoor married Christa Giles, a Canadian diplomat working at the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|The {{critical}} and commercial {{success of the}} film of David Copperfield led to an invitation to return to Hollywood in 1936. When he got there {{he found that the}} studio executives had no idea which films they wanted him to work on, and he had eight weeks of highly paid leisure, during which he wrote a short story and worked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel.</b> He was eventually asked to write the scenario for Little Lord Fauntleroy, which he enjoyed doing. He spent most of his fees on paintings, forgetting to keep enough money to pay US tax on his earnings. He replenished his American funds with a lecture tour – his last – in late 1936.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Snow White, {{which was}} a short story that the writers could expand and {{experiment}} with, Pinocchio was based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> with a very fixed story. Therefore, the story went through drastic changes before reaching its final incarnation. In the original novel, Pinocchio is a cold, rude, ungrateful, inhuman creature that often repels sympathy and only learns his lessons by means of brutal torture. The writers decided to modernize the character and depict him similar to Edgar Bergen's dummy Charlie McCarthy, but equally as rambunctious as the puppet in the book. The story was still being developed {{in the early stages}} of animation.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the two {{previous}} Transformers installments, which were {{based solely on the}} script writers' endemic story, Transformers: Dark of the Moon was based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> called , written by Alan Dean Foster. The novel is a prequel to the 2007 film Transformers. It follows the same story structure as Dark of the Moon, being set in 1969, the year of Apollo 11. The story structure differs slightly, though, because the novel was written merely as prequel to the first film.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{leaving the}} Army, Carradine became serious about his acting pursuits. It {{was at that}} time that he was advised to change his name to avoid {{confusion}} with his famous father. In 1963, he made his television debut on an episode of Armstrong Circle Theatre. Several other television roles were to follow including appearances on Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour. He made his feature film debut in 1964 in Taggart, a western based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> by Louis L'Amour.|$|E

5|$|While in Lagos, Achebe {{started work}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel.</b> This was challenging, since very little African fiction {{had been written}} in English, {{although}} Amos Tutuola's Palm-Wine Drinkard (1952) and Cyprian Ekwensi's People of the City (1954) were notable exceptions. While appreciating Ekwensi's work, Achebe worked hard to develop his own style, even as he pioneered {{the creation of the}} Nigerian novel itself. A visit to Nigeria by Queen Elizabeth II in 1956 brought issues of colonialism and politics to the surface, and was a significant moment for Achebe.|$|E
5|$|With Grisélidis and Cendrillon complete, {{though still}} {{awaiting}} performance, Massenet {{began work on}} Sapho, based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> by Daudet about the love of an innocent young man from {{the country for a}} worldly-wise Parisienne. It was given at the Opéra-Comique in November 1897, with great success, though it has been neglected since the composer's death. His next work staged there was Cendrillon, his version of the Cinderella story, which was well received in May 1899.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{his work}} as a barrister, Hastings also tried his hand at writing plays. His first play was The Moscow Doctor, based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> by Seton Merriman which he had rewritten; it ran for over a week in Brighton. He desired to have an {{original}} work performed, however, and to this end wrote The River over a period of 20 years before taking it to St James's Theatre, where it was accepted and performed in June 1925. The play starred Owen Nares and initially went well, but foundered in the second act due to the plot requiring the most popular actors to be taken off stage - the character played by Nares, for example, broke his leg. Reviews compared the plot to something out of the Boy's Own Paper. The play lasted only a month before being cancelled, but Hastings was able to sell the film rights for £2,000, and it was turned into a Hollywood film called The Notorious Lady starring Lewis Stone and Barbara Bedford.|$|E
