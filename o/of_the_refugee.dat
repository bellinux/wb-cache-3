Instead, he decided to portray the plight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> from a different angle. The band members unanimously agreed upon Petrossian's treatment. The video deals various themes, including consumerism, fair trade, and sweatshops, and attempts showcase how conventional business models allow for various human rights violations.|$|E

5|$|Although {{his primary}} reason for {{military}} action in Zaire was the dismantling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> camps, Kagame also began planning a war to remove long-time dictator President Mobutu Sese Seko from power. Mobutu had supported the genocidaires based in the camps, and was also accused of allowing attacks on Tutsi people within Zaire. Together with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Kagame supported the newly created Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (ADFL), an alliance of four rebel groups headed by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, which began waging the First Congo War. The ADFL, helped by Rwandan and Ugandan troops, took control of North and South Kivu provinces in November 1996 and then advanced west, gaining territory from the poorly organised and demotivated Zairian army with little fighting. By May 1997, they controlled almost the whole of Zaire except for the capital Kinshasa; Mobutu fled and the ADFL took the capital without fighting. The country was renamed as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Kabila became the new president. The Rwandan Defence Forces and the ADFL were accused of carrying out mass atrocities during the First Congo War, {{with as many as}} 222,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees declared missing.|$|E
5|$|South Sudan competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. South Sudan {{had been}} an {{independent}} nation since 2011, but its civil war had delayed its membership with the International Olympic Committee until 2015, making 2016 its first official appearance at the Olympic Games. The country was offered three universality placements in athletics, as no South Sudanese athletes met the Olympic qualifying standards prior to the Games. Three athletes, two men and one woman, competed in three track and field events, but did not win any medals. The sole woman, Margret Rumat Hassan, was given a spot eight days {{prior to the start}} of the Games that had been allotted previously to Mangar Makur Chuot. This change was against the advice of the South Sudan Athletics Federation and was due allegedly to pressure from Samsung, for whom Hassan had appeared in an advertisement. The flagbearer for both the opening and closing ceremony was Guor Marial, a marathon runner who, then unable to represent South Sudan, had competed as an Independent Olympic Athlete in 2012. Five South Sudanese nationals also competed as members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Refugee</b> Olympic Team.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s about 25,000 African {{refugees}} were resettled in the United States throughout different locations such as South Dakota, Tennessee and Minnesota.

25|$|Incentive staff {{represents}} {{only a small}} fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> population. The work opportunities available from the UNHCR, the WFP or partner agencies usually consist of jobs involving physical labour (construction and security) or low-level clerical work, including bookkeeping and nursing. Positions are filled through personal networks and influence. Incentives are vital to the survival of the population – they ensure that some money is injected into the camp economy.|$|E
25|$|The Polisario Front {{is led by}} a Secretary General. The first Secretary General was Brahim Gali, {{replaced}} in 1974 by El-Ouali at the II Congress of the Polisario Front, followed by Mahfoud Ali Beiba as Interim Secretary General upon his death. In 1976, Mohamed Abdelaziz was elected at the III Congress of the Polisario, and has held the post ever since. The Secretary General is elected by the General Popular Congress (GPC), regularly convened every four years. The GPC is composed of delegates from the Popular Congresses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> camps in Tindouf, which are held biannually in each camp, and of delegates from the women's organization (UNMS), youth organization (UJSARIO), workers' organization (UGTSARIO) and military delegates from the SPLA (see below). All residents of the camps have {{a vote in the}} Popular Congresses, and participate in the administrative work in the camp through base-level 11-person cells, which form the smallest unit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> camp political structure. These typically care for distribution of food, water and schooling in their area, joining in higher-level organs (encompassing several camp quarters) to cooperate and establish distribution chains. There is no formal membership of Polisario; instead, anyone who participates in its work or lives in the refugee camps is considered a member.|$|E

In addition, after the war, a number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> teachers left the school. Already difficult to staff, the situation {{did not improve}} after the war; rather, the low salary and remote location made recruitment of new teachers increasingly difficult.

25|$|URM was {{established}} in 1980 {{as a result of}} the legislative branch’s enactment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Refugee</b> Act that same year. Initially, it was developed to “address the needs of thousands of children in Southeast Asia” who were displaced due to civil unrest and economic problems resulting from the aftermath of the Vietnam War, which had ended only five years earlier. Coordinating with the United Nations and “utilizing an executive order to raise immigration quotas, President Carter doubled the number of Southeast Asian refugees allowed into the United States each month.” The URM {{was established}}, in part, to deal with the influx of refugee children.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} {{has resulted in}} a large number of both civilian deaths and refugees, with many refugees fleeing to Thailand. The UN estimates that between 1996 and 2006, around 1million people were internally displaced inside Myanmar, over 230,000 of whom remain displaced in southeast Myanmar, and 128,000 refugees live in temporary shelters on the Thai-Myanmar border. In August 2007, approximately 160,000 refugees fled to nine refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar border and the Thai border provinces of Chiang Mai and Ratchaburi. Approximately 62% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> population consisted of people from the Karen ethnic minority. Humanitarian organisations such as Doctors Without Borders have since sent assistance and support to the refugees.|$|E

25|$|The {{resolution}} is the formula {{proposed by the}} Security Council for the successful resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict, in particular, ending the state of belligerency then existing between the 'States concerned', Israel and Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. The resolution deals with five principles; withdrawal of Israeli forces, 'peace within secure and recognized boundaries', freedom of navigation, a just settlement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> problem and security measures including demilitarized zones. It also provided for {{the appointment of a}} Special Representative to proceed to the Middle East in order to promote agreement on a peaceful and accepted settlement in accordance with the principles outlined in the resolution.|$|E
25|$|In April 1995, {{there was}} a serious {{outbreak}} of violence in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> camps that 2 RAR personnel were based at. Outnumbered and unable to undertake offensive operations due to the restrictions placed upon their operations by the UN Mandate governing the deployment, the Australians were unable to intervene. It has since been estimated that up to 4,000 refugees were killed {{by members of the}} Rwandan Patriotic Army in this incident, although this number may well have been higher if not for the efforts of the Australian medics and infantrymen who braved hostile fire on numerous occasions without the ability to return fire as they attempted to assist the wounded and dying.|$|E
25|$|Historically, refugee {{populations have}} often been portrayed as a {{security}} threat. In the U.S and Europe, {{there has been much}} focus on the narrative that terrorists maintain networks amongst transnational, refugee, and migrant populations. This fear has been exaggerated into a modern-day Islamist terrorism Trojan Horse in which terrorists hide among refugees and penetrate host countries. 'Muslim-refugee-as-an-enemy-within' rhetoric is relatively new, but the underlying scapegoating of out-groups for domestic societal problems, fears and ethno-nationalist sentiment is not new. In the 1890s, the influx of Eastern European Jewish refugees to London coupled with the rise of anarchism in the city led to a confluence of threat-perception and fear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> out-group. Populist rhetoric then too propelled debate over migration control and protecting national security.|$|E

25|$|According to Michael Lynk, {{there are}} three schools of thought {{concerning}} the proper legal interpretation of the withdrawal phrase. Some of the parties involved {{have suggested that the}} indefinite language is a “perceptible loophole”, that authorizes “territorial revision” for Israel’s benefit. Some have stated that the indefinite language was used to permit insubstantial and mutually beneficial alterations to the 1949 armistices lines, but that unilateral annexation of the captured territory was never authorized. Other parties have said that no final settlement obtained through force or the threat of force could be considered valid. They insist that the Security Council cannot create loopholes in peremptory norms of international law or the UN Charter, and that any use of indefinite language has to be interpreted in line with the overriding legal principles regarding the “inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war” and the prohibitions on mass deportations or displacement in connection with the settlement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> problem.|$|E
25|$|Rather severe {{were the}} {{demographic}} {{changes of the}} Anatolian Greek population, {{as well as the}} changes in the demography of Greece herself. The Young Turks revolution, the Asia Minor Expedition and subsequent Catastrophe, had as a result, apart from the 1.5million refugees, the death of approximately 1million ethnic Greek civilians (the most notable case being the Greek genocide) and the hostage {{of hundreds of thousands of}} Greek men, who were not allowed to leave Anatolia, but were sent to labor battalions after the war (it is estimated that as many as 150,000 Greek men from Smyrna were not allowed to go to Greece). The demographic bleeding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> population continued in Greece, where thousands of people (especially women and children) died of diseases. The diseases had also an impact on the native population of the country. Apart from malaria, which caused the death of tens of thousands, diseases that had not appeared in Greece for years (cholera, plague) increased the already high mortality rates.|$|E
25|$|On 13 March 1970, {{contingency}} planning began for evacuation of noncombat personnel from Long Tieng and Sam Thong, as Vang Pao again mulled moving his Hmong community toward the Thai border. Renewed PAVN attacks on 15 March on several Royalist positions in MR 2 began before the evacuation could start. A company of PAVN troops hit the perimeter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> relief center at Sam Thong. On 17 March, emergency evacuation of Royalist wounded, Laotian civilians, and Americans from Sam Thong began despite continuing wretched flying weather. The next day, the last Hmong irregulars abandoned Sam Thong to the communists, who promptly torched half of it. As the retreating Hmong gathered at Long Tieng, PAVN infantry roved the ridgeline above it five kilometers to the northeast. By now, three-fourths of Long Tieng's populace—the noncombatant portion—was being evacuated via air. The CIA case agents on site destroyed their classified material. Vang Pao's reserves {{were reduced to}} two companies of recruits pulled from basic training, his military band, and 28 aviation technicians. However the 20A airfield remained open as Vang Pao personally defended it with a mortar.|$|E
