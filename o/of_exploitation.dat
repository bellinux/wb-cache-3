5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is a form}} of mimicry {{in which}} predators, parasites or parasitoids share similar signals, using a {{harmless}} model, allowing them to avoid being correctly identified by their prey or host. In its broadest sense, it could include various types <b>of</b> <b>exploitation,</b> as when an orchid exploits a male insect by mimicking a sexually receptive female (see pseudocopulation), but will here be restricted to forms <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> involving feeding. An alternative term Peckhamian mimicry (after George and Elizabeth Peckham) has been suggested, but is seldom used. The metaphor of a wolf in sheep's clothing can be used as an analogy, but with the caveat that mimics are not intentionally deceiving their prey. For example, indigenous Australians who dress up as and imitate kangaroos when hunting would not be considered aggressive mimics, nor would a human angler. Treated separately is molecular mimicry, which also shares some similarity; for instance a virus may mimic the molecular properties of its host, allowing it access to its cells.|$|E

5|$|Dworkin {{authored}} ten {{books of}} radical feminist theory and numerous speeches and articles, each designed to assert {{the presence of}} and denounce institutionalized and normalized harm against women. She {{became one of the}} most influential writers and spokeswomen of American radical feminism during the late 1970s and the 1980s. She characterized pornography as an industry of damaging objectification and abuse, not merely a fantasy realm. She discussed prostitution as a system <b>of</b> <b>exploitation,</b> and intercourse as a key site of subordination in patriarchy. Her analysis and writing influenced and inspired the work of contemporary feminists, such as Catharine MacKinnon, Gloria Steinem, John Stoltenberg, Nikki Craft, Susan Cole, and Amy Elman.|$|E
40|$|The article {{undertakes}} {{an attempt}} to determine the systems <b>of</b> agricultural <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> land for groups of provinces distinguished {{on the basis of}} similarity of structures <b>of</b> agricultural <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> land. The 1987 data on <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> farmland and the area of crops in particular provinces have been utilized. The research procedure consisted, in the first stage, in grouping the provinces according to the criterion <b>of</b> land <b>exploitation</b> structure and, in the second stage, according to the criterion of types of crops prevailing in a given structure. The findings allowed to ascribe names to different systems <b>of</b> land <b>exploitation.</b> The analysis resulted in distinguishing 19 groups of provinces similar {{from the point of view}} <b>of</b> land <b>exploitation</b> structure and 18 different types of systems. The above classifications were the basis for characterizing the systems and their intensity on the background of production conditions...|$|R

5|$|Harmless to humans, the hardnose shark {{is caught}} with {{gillnets}} and line gear by artisanal and commercial fisheries {{across much of}} its range. It is used for meat, which is sold fresh or dried and salted, though its small size limits its economic importance. Its low reproductive rate may render it susceptible to overfishing, and given existing levels <b>of</b> <b>exploitation,</b> the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Near Threatened. Off northern Australia, the hardnose shark makes up 13.6% of the gillnet catch and 4.0% of the longline catch. Since these losses {{do not appear to}} have diminished its population there, the IUCN has given it a regional assessment of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Portugal's wars against {{independence}} guerrilla {{fighters in}} its 400-year-old African territories began in 1961 with Angola. In Mozambique, the conflict erupted in 1964 {{as a result}} of unrest and frustration amongst many indigenous Mozambican populations, who perceived foreign rule to be a form <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> and mistreatment, which served only to further Portuguese economic interests in the region. Many Mozambicans also resented Portugal's policies towards indigenous people, which resulted in discrimination, traditional lifestyle turning difficult for many Africans, and limited access to Portuguese-style education and skilled employment.|$|E

These reports' main objectives were to accelerate the reform process and strengthen the socialist-oriented market economy. The congress allowed existing party members to engage in private ownership. This was a controversial amendment and was a break with the theory <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> of man by man. While the amendment was approved, the third plenum of the 10th Central Committee restricted the change to party members who had worked in state-owned enterprises which have been privatized.|$|E
5|$|There are {{no known}} {{morphological}} {{differences between the}} three island populations, but Turvey and colleagues found that animals from Nevis were slightly smaller than those from the two other islands. Such a difference in size {{might be related to}} the fact that Saint Kitts is larger than Nevis, in accordance with the trend that animals become larger on larger islands. However, Turvey and colleagues also observed that their Saint Kitts material consisted of older individuals than those from Nevis; thus, the size difference may result from differences in the mode <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> by Amerindians.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{abundant}} sharks within its range, the milk shark feeds primarily on small bony fishes, but also takes cephalopods and crustaceans. In turn, it often falls prey to larger sharks and possibly marine mammals. In common {{with other members of}} its family, this species is viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by a placental connection. Females give birth to one to eight young either during a defined breeding season or throughout the year, depending on location. The reproductive cycle is usually annual, but may be biennial or triennial. Large numbers of milk sharks are caught by artisanal and commercial fisheries in many countries for meat, fins, and fishmeal. Despite this, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as being of Least Concern, because its wide distribution and relatively high productivity seemingly allow present levels <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> to be sustained.|$|E

50|$|Finally, as Piero Sraffa showed clearly, {{the theory}} of the {{production}} and distribution of a surplus, however it might be devised, is logically independent of any particular theory <b>of</b> the <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> labour.

Consequently, if Marx's theory <b>of</b> labour <b>exploitation</b> is false, this is a separate issue.|$|R
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature has {{listed the}} milk shark under Least Concern; despite being heavily fished, {{it has a}} wide {{distribution}} and remains fairly common. The reproductive characteristics of this species suggests {{it is capable of}} withstanding a somewhat high level <b>of</b> <b>exploitation,</b> though not as much as the grey sharpnose shark (R. oligolinx) or Australian sharpnose shark (R. taylori). In the 1980s and early 1990s, stock assessments of the milk shark off India's Verval coast concluded catches by gillnet and trawl fisheries were below the maximum sustainable level. However, these studies were based on methodologies that have subsequently been proven unreliable for shark populations. Moreover, fishing pressure in the region has increased substantially since the assessments were conducted.|$|E

25|$|Articles 19 and 32-36 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child {{prohibits the}} {{exploitation}} of children in any form and in any context. Any child who is exposed to violence, exploitation or abuse {{can be considered a}} victim of crime and enjoys the correlated rights and entitlements, including access to assistance, protection and support, services for recovery and rehabilitation, access to justice, with due procedural safeguards in any related legal or administrative proceedings. Children at risk <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> have to be identified and recognised as being at risk. This implies that {{they have a right to}} assistance and support in order to prevent their exploitation or any other harm resulting from the risks. Considering the difficulties of identifying children who have been trafficked and the broad protection against all forms and contexts <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> afforded under the Convention, a child rights-based approach prioritises the identification of child victims <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> or other crime and children at risk.
