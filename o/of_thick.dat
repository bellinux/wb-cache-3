5|$|Many welding {{processes}} {{require the use}} of a particular joint design; for example, resistance spot welding, laser beam welding, and electron beam welding are most frequently performed on lap joints. Other welding methods, like shielded metal arc welding, are extremely versatile and can weld virtually any type of joint. Some processes {{can also be used to}} make multipass welds, in which one weld is allowed to cool, and then another weld is performed on top of it. This allows for the welding <b>of</b> <b>thick</b> sections arranged in a single-V preparation joint, for example.|$|E

5|$|Modern steels {{are made}} with varying {{combinations}} of alloy metals to fulfill many purposes. Carbon steel, composed simply of iron and carbon, accounts for 90% of steel production. Low alloy steel is alloyed with other elements, usually molybdenum, manganese, chromium, or nickel, in amounts of up to 10% by weight to improve the hardenability <b>of</b> <b>thick</b> sections. High strength low alloy steel has small additions (usually < 2% by weight) of other elements, typically 1.5% manganese, to provide additional strength for a modest price increase.|$|E
5|$|The 37th Boat Race, {{an annual}} {{side-by-side}} rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames, {{took place on}} 22 March 1880 following a postponement two days earlier as a result <b>of</b> <b>thick</b> fog. It {{is the only time}} in the history of the event that the race has been rescheduled. Oxford won by a margin of three-and-three-quarter lengths in a time of 21 minutes 23 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The American {{airborne}} landings {{began with}} the arrival of pathfinders at 00:15. Navigation was difficult because of a bank <b>of</b> <b>thick</b> cloud, and as a result only one of the five paratrooper drop zones was accurately marked with radar signals and Aldis lamps. Paratroopers of the US 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, numbering over 13,000 men, were delivered by Douglas C-47 Skytrains of the IX Troop Carrier Command. To avoid flying over the invasion fleet, the planes arrived from the west over the Cotentin Peninsula and exited over Utah Beach.|$|E

They {{are formed}} {{by a combination of}} the praemaxillae, nasals, prefrontals and frontals, as in Saurolophus, but instead of projecting backwards as a spine, they rise up to make the highest point above the orbit. The two halves of the crest are separated by a median suture. In front of the orbit, the crest is made <b>of</b> <b>thick</b> bone.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of high-explosive shells made {{the use of}} iron armor plate on warships necessary. In 1859 France launched , the first ocean-going ironclad warship. She had {{the profile of a}} ship of the line, cut to one deck due to weight considerations. Although made of wood and reliant on sail for most journeys, Gloire was fitted with a propeller, and her wooden hull was protected by a layer <b>of</b> <b>thick</b> iron armor. Gloire prompted further innovation from the Royal Navy, anxious to prevent France from gaining a technological lead.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} {{began when}} five armed {{members of the}} United Red Army (URA), following a bloody purge that left 14 {{members of the group}} plus one bystander dead, broke into a holiday lodge below Mount Asama, taking the wife of the lodge-keeper as a hostage. A standoff between police and the URA radicals took place, lasting ten days. The lodge was a natural fortress, solidly constructed <b>of</b> <b>thick</b> concrete on a steep hillside with only one entrance, which, along with their guns, enabled the hostage-takers to keep police at a distance.|$|E

5|$|After a {{bill that}} would have {{provided}} funds to protect the site failed, then-President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an Executive Order that authorized funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to build a levee around the site to protect it from the imminent flooding caused by construction of the Lower Monumental Dam. Late that year, Daugherty left the dig, leaving Fryxell to lead the project. Once the Lower Monumental Dam was closed in February 1969, within three days, the site was completely underwater, due to the seepage <b>of</b> <b>thick</b> layers of gravel that had not been accounted for. However, as the site was being flooded, the excavation team laid down plastic sheeting topped with gravel in the hopes of being able to return to the dig in the future.|$|E
5|$|Although the casemates {{have been}} altered over the years, {{many of their}} {{original}} features survive. None of the guns remain in situ but the metal rails on which they traversed are still in place. The casemates {{were divided into two}} sections. During periods of high alert the gun crews would live next to their weapons in the casemates' rear, an area known as the war accommodation. The front of the casemate was the gun emplacement proper, where the loading and firing took place. The iron shield protecting each casemate was fitted with iron bars from which two mantlets made <b>of</b> <b>thick</b> lengths of rope were hung. These protected the gun crew from splinters and smoke. A loading bar above the gun-port enabled the crew to lift the heavy shells and cartridges up to the mouth of the gun. These were dispensed from the magazines below via lifts {{on either side of the}} emplacements.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have a very}} {{efficient}} system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed <b>of</b> <b>thick</b> elastic muscles to withstand {{the pressure of the}} ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Blood travels through the arterioles and moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur.|$|E

5|$|Fruit bodies {{arise from}} the tips or the lateral {{branches}} or rhizomorphs. New fruit bodies are made of an exterior <b>of</b> <b>thick</b> hyphae {{similar to those found}} in the rhizomorph core; in contrast, the hyphae of the interior originate from the puffball's core. Unlike some other puffball species, the peridium does not differentiate into a distinct exoperidium and endoperidium; rather, the outer layer develops the features of a pseudoparenchyma (a tightly organised tissue where the tightly packed cells resemble plant parenchyma) as the radial and tangential hyphae become interweaved. In time, the peridium dries and falls off in flakes to expose the underlying gleba.|$|E
5|$|Mansaf is a {{traditional}} meal in the central West Bank and Naqab region in the southern West Bank, having its roots from the Bedouin population of ancient Arabia. It is mostly cooked on occasions such as, during holidays, weddings or a large gathering. Mansaf is cooked as a lamb leg or large pieces of lamb {{on top of a}} taboon bread that has usually been smothered with yellow rice. A type <b>of</b> <b>thick</b> and dried cheesecloth yogurt from goat's milk, called jameed, is poured on top of the lamb and rice to give it its distinct flavor and taste. The dish is also garnished with cooked pine nuts and almonds. The classic form of eating mansaf is using the right hand as a utensil. For politeness, participants in the feast tear pieces of meat to hand to the person next to them.|$|E
5|$|Paratroops from 101st Airborne {{were dropped}} {{beginning}} around 01:30, tasked with controlling the causeways behind Utah Beach and destroying road and rail bridges over the Douve River. The C-47s could not fly {{in a tight}} formation because <b>of</b> <b>thick</b> cloud cover, and many paratroopers were dropped far from their intended landing zones. Many planes came in so low that they were under fire from both flak and machine gun fire. Some paratroopers were killed on impact when their parachutes {{did not have time}} to open, and others drowned in the flooded fields. Gathering together into fighting units was made difficult by a shortage of radios and by the bocage terrain, with its hedgerows, stone walls, and marshes. Some units did not arrive at their targets until afternoon, by which time several of the causeways had already been cleared by members of the 4th Infantry Division moving up from the beach.|$|E

5|$|Taking the bait, the {{following}} day Howe attacked again, but his attempt to split the French fleet in half was unsuccessful when his lead ship, HMS Caesar, failed to follow orders. Much damage was done to both fleets but the action was inconclusive, and the two forces again separated without having settled the issue. Howe had however gained an important advantage during the engagement by seizing the weather gage, enabling him to further attack Villaret {{at a time of}} his choosing. Three French ships were sent back to port with damage, but these losses were offset by reinforcements gained {{the following}} day with the arrival of Nielly's detached squadron. Battle was postponed during the next two days because <b>of</b> <b>thick</b> fog, but when the haze lifted on 1 June 1794, the battle lines were only 6miles (10km) apart and Howe was prepared to force a decisive action.|$|E
5|$|The Allied force {{successfully}} {{reached the}} Solomon Islands without being detected by the Japanese because <b>of</b> <b>thick</b> fog and haze. Saratoga launched 24 Dauntlesses {{and a dozen}} Wildcats early on 7 August to attack targets on Guadalcanal. Her air group commander, Commander Harry D. Felt, coordinated the attack over the island, which also included eight Wildcats from Enterprises VF-6. The aircraft focused on the nearly complete airfield at Lunga and dispersed the two construction battalions building it. This allowed the 1st Marine Division to capture it (renaming it Henderson Field) without resistance. For {{the rest of the}} day, the carriers provided a combat air patrol (CAP) over the transports and themselves while their other aircraft provided air support for the Marines as needed.|$|E
5|$|The Diversity {{indices of}} the plant species were recorded; they were a {{richness}} of 48, diversity of 0.29 and evenness of 0.47 in summer. In winter, the respective figures were 81, 0.17 and 0.52. Species richness {{was found to be}} different in 48 samples of thin phumdis, 53 samples <b>of</b> <b>thick</b> phumdis and 14 samples on hard ground. The eight plant communities identified during winter and summer were Capillipedium, Leersia hexandra, Oenanthe javanica, Phragmites karka, Kyllinga triceps, Pteridium aquilinum, Zizania latifolia and Persicaria perfoliata. Zizania latifolia recorded the highest productivity with (13.90±5.01)g/m2 for winter and (102.96±26.03)g/m2 for summer. Greater productivity was recorded in summer (65.96g/m2) than winter (15.76g/m2). Variation of productivity of annuals and perennials were noted according to seasons and type of phumdis.|$|E
