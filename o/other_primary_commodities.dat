In particular, some economic observers and financial market participants are concerned that disinflation, the process of lowering the inflation rate, may {{go so far as to}} produce deflation, a persistent decline in the general price level. These observers point to large decreases in petroleum prices and <b>other</b> <b>primary</b> <b>commodity</b> prices, rapidly falling computer prices, and moderate declines in U.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} Ghana’s cocoa {{industry from}} the innovation systems perspective. Cocoa {{is the major}} cash crop of Ghana. Its importance is {{not only in the}} contribution of about 25 % annually of the total foreign exchange earnings but also on account of being the source of livelihoods for many rural farmers and the related actors in the value chain. The critical actors in the innovation system are the farmers, the researchers, the buyers, the transporters, public officers, consumers and the policy makers. By the roles and functions they perform, they impact on the dynamics of the cocoa industry. The paper describes the trends in cocoa production and processing and highlights the key characteristics and implications. It discusses the policy reforms in the cocoa industry and the major drivers of the reforms. The Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) {{is one of the biggest}} public institutions in Ghana and its subsidiaries are major actors in the production process of cocoa for export. The key reforms in the policies governing the industry were the dissolution of the monopoly of Produce Buying Company and the deregulation of cocoa purchasing to allow Licensed Buying Companies (LBCs) to enter the business in 1992 / 93 crop season. There was also the dismantling and re-organization of the Cocoa Services Division into two separate units—the Cocoa Swollen Shoot Virus Disease Control Unit (CSSVDCU) and the Seed Production Unit (SPU). The processing of cocoa into cocoa butter, cocoa paste and confectioneries is an important component of the value chain especially with the national goal of processing 50 % of cocoa before export.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the rapidly-growing links between China and SSA. The {{spotlight}} is placed on three vectors of interaction – trade, foreign investment and aid. Chinese involvement in Africa is driven predominantly by the quest for material inputs (oil and <b>other</b> <b>primary</b> <b>commodities)</b> required for its infrastructural investments and booming manufacturing sector. At least {{in the early years}} of this involvement, there appears to be close coordination between Chinese involvement in these three related vectors. Chinese involvement in SSA has important policy implications for growth, distribution and policy. Whilst it has provided a spur for some of SSA’s key commodity exporting economies, its impact on manufacturing (both that destined for domestic and export markets) has been adverse. Even some of the benefits of the commodity price boom are ambiguous, since these are often associated with rising exchange rates, corruption and violent conflict. Commodity-based production also has adverse distributional impacts when compared to manufacturing. The rapid growth and significance of enhanced Chinese participation in SSA has important implications for both future research (there are large unknowns and the picture is changing so rapidly) and for a poverty-focused policy agenda.

More recently, economists {{have attempted to}} explain what The Economist has called Africa 2 ̆ 7 s new 2 ̆ 2 period of unparalleled economic success 2 ̆ 2 (The Economist 2008 a, 33). Average annual real GDP growth was 1. 8 percent between 1980 and 1989 and increased to 4. 4 percent between 2000 and 2005. Per head, real growth in Africa fell by 1. 1 percent between 1980 and 1989 and increased 2. 1 percent between 2000 and 2005 (World Bank 2007 a). This recent reversal of fortune may stem from the broad economic reforms that many African countries instituted during the 1990 s, especially macroeconomic stabilization and financial-market liberalization. But {{it may also be}} due to the recent boom in international prices of oil, copper, and <b>other</b> <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> that constitute a significant fraction of Africa 2 ̆ 7 s exports (International Monetary Fund (IMF) 2006).

The present paper tests whether HHR's conclusions are valid even in times of economic crisis and rising prices of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities,</b> using data from 2004 - 2013. We show that, in the aggregate, higher values of EXPY are connected with faster economic growth.

40|$|Several authors, notably Prebisch (1950) and Singer (1950), {{have argued}} {{that there is a}} secular {{tendency}} for the terms of trade for <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> to deteriorate over time.

Since such data also include those for years characterized by unusual occurrences, like World Wars and breakdowns of currency regimes (as happened to the Bretton Woods system in 1971), which have the effect of suddenly pushing up <b>primary</b> <b>commodity</b> prices, any tendency towards secular deterioration gets obscured by these sudden occasional boosts.

To this purpose we employ a system of equations. We use interactive terms to estimate separate slope coefficients for Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, Central African countries, and rest of the world. The main results of our exercise can be summarised as follows: (i) a higher dependence on <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> reduces economic growth, increases income inequality, and slows down the rate of human capital accumulation; (ii) the negative effects of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> on growth, inequality and human capital appear to be statistically stronger in Central Africa and SSA than {{in the rest of the}} world; (iii) in the case of growth and inequality, the negative effect of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> and the differences of the slope coefficients across groups of countries persist after controlling for the quality of institutions; on the contrary (iv) in the case of human capital, the negative effect of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> as well as the differences across groups of countries vanish once institutional development is controlled for. Two main policy recommendations stem from our analysis. First, the degree of dependence on <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> must be reduced through the diversification of productive structure in order to foster development.

40|$|In {{the distant}} past prices of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> had shown a {{tendency}} of decrease and their increase was recorded only during the First and Second World Wars. Since 1950 s there had been recorded a slight decrease in global price indices of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities,</b> while in early 1970 s they grew to a considerable extent. After that and up to 2001 the global nominal price indices and particularly real price indices of non-energy primary products drastically fell reaching the lowest level in their history. This applied to prices of all <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> as a whole {{as well as to}} all groupings of these products. On the other hand, prices of industrial products exported by developed countries to underdeveloped and medium-developed ones, dynamically grew {{in the second half of}} the previous century. Thus, the terms of trade substantially aggravated for underdeveloped countries whose exports structure is still dominated by non-energy <b>primary</b> <b>commodities.</b> Therefore, the negative correlation was clearly manifested between a very high share of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> in the structure of commodity exports and a very low per capita income in a number of developing countries. The drastic fall in prices of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> and the simultaneous dynamic growth in prices of industrial products caused to a great extent reduction of the share of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> in the world commodity trade - from 57 per cent recorded in 1950 to only over 20 per cent recorded in late 20 th and early 21 st centuries. Among numerous factors that have brought about a drastic fall in prices of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> the most prominent are: technical and technological progress in their production, production of their substitutes, in traffic and other sectors as well. Apart from this, the decrease in prices of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> has been considerably caused by change in exchange rate at par to US dollar, agricultural policies of developed countries, privatisation of companies that produce commodities and particularly by too excessive production and purchase in relation to demand and spending that in recent years have been under the impact of recession that has emerged in developed economies and a number of newly industrialised and developing countries, as well as a very slow revival of economies in transition. By all this, a drastic fall in prices of a number of particular products from this group has also resulted from the impact exerted by some specific factors. Taking into consideration the fact that the impact of the most important factors that have brought about the drastic fall in prices of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> is of permanent character and that it will be exerted to a greater or lesser extent in the next dozen of years the experts of the World Bank forecasted in late 2002 that, taken as a whole, the real prices of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> would slightly increase by 2015, but they would still be at a lower level than in 1990.
