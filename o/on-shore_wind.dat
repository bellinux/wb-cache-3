50|$|Blowouts {{are formed}} by the <b>on-shore</b> <b>winds</b> of Lake Michigan. The winds move sand and pile it into dunes. As the dunes form, plants begin to take hold, {{stabilizing}} the sand.

Slowly other plants take root in the protected areas, including bearberry (kinnikinnick) and small evergreens. Over time, larger plants like sumac, sand cherry, cottonwood, and juniper take hold and replace the grasses and smaller plants.|$|R

50|$|Sea foam, ocean foam, beach foam, or spume {{is a type}} of foam {{created by}} the {{agitation}} of seawater, particularly when it contains higher concentrations of dissolved organic matter (including proteins, lignins, and lipids) derived from sources such as the offshore breakdown of algal blooms. These compounds can act as surfactants or foaming agents. As the seawater is churned by breaking waves in the surf zone adjacent to the shore, the presence of these surfactants under these turbulent conditions traps air, forming persistent bubbles that stick to each other through surface tension. Due to its low density and persistence, foam can be blown by strong <b>on-shore</b> <b>winds</b> from the beachface inland.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Recruitment {{success in}} {{demersal}} fish species that settle in estuaries after a pelagic larval duration in coastal waters {{is dependent on}} (1) abiotic and biotic variables that promote good survival, and (2) local environmental conditions that facilitate and direct the transport of larvae to settlement habitats. In the present study, we described the patterns of larval abundance, pelagic larval duration and settlement of a commercially important sparid, Chrysophrys auratus, in northern New Zealand over 2 years, and investigated the relationships among pelagic larval duration or daily settler abundance and various environmental variables. Pelagic larval duration varied from 17 to 33 days and the successful spawning period that produced settled juveniles varied from 29 to 109 days among our four sites. For 91 % of fish captured, the average temperature during the pelagic larval duration was. 188 C. Significant correlations between daily settler abundance and environmental variables varied among sites and between years; however, temperature, tidal range and on-shorewinds weremost strongly correlated with settlement, explaining up to 38 %of the variability in settler abundance. The present results suggested that, in some locations, high water temperatures, large tides and <b>on-shore</b> <b>winds</b> are likely to increase recruitment success in C. auratus...|$|R
