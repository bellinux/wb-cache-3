5|$|The Abbott family once {{constructed}} a sawmill on Stafford Meadow Brook near Scranton. It eventually {{came to be}} owned by the Slocum family. The Lackawanna Coal and Iron Company historically had substantial operations in the watershed of the stream. The company was {{closely linked to the}} stream's watershed during its development in the 1840s. In the 1880s, they constructed several iron ore quarries along the stream. In the early 1900s, the main industries in the watershed of Stafford Meadow Brook included agriculture and coal mining. The stream became a major water supply by the early 1900s, when it was used as such by the Scranton Gas and Water Company. It continues {{to be used as a}} water supply in the 21st century. Historic sites in the watershed of Stafford Meadow Brook include the Pennsylvania Gravity Railroad and Ore Mine Road. The stream also passes by St. Mary's Cemetery. Several <b>old</b> <b>rail</b> corridors remain in the watershed: the Erie and Wyoming Valley Railroad, the Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad, the remains of the Pennsylvania Coal Company Gravity Railroad, and the Lackawanna Coal and Iron Company gravity railroad. As of 2001, there are plans to revive the Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad as a freight and tourist line.|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the route}} between Beaumont and to a point near Millers Flat (Minzion) has been made into a public rail trail/track and can now be driven, cycled or walked over. This track {{is known as the}} Millennium track and a panel {{explaining}} the significance of the rail trail route and other interesting facts is {{at the site of the}} old Beaumont railway station at Beaumont just before the SH8 bridge crossing the Clutha river. Several of the old railway bridges alongside the eastern bank of the Clutha River were left in place after the line was lifted through the area in October/November 1968 and later in May 1969 after the Railways Department agreed not to remove the bridges with the then Tuapeka County Council. The trail track through the Beaumont gorge diverts briefly from the <b>old</b> <b>rail</b> corridor to pass over a hill at point known as the Lonely Graves where [...] "Somebody's Darling" [...] lies buried. This burial site was highlighted in Billy Connolly's World Tour of NZ filmed in 2004. The old railway at this point goes around a bluff alongside the Clutha river known as Horseshoe Bend. Past this point heading up to Millers Flat the Millennium trail forms part of the <b>old</b> <b>rail</b> line again until it joins up with up the old Millers Flat - Craig Flat road nearer to the old Minzion station site.|$|E

[...] A number of relics remain in Roxburgh from its days as a railway terminus; these include a water tank for steam locomotives, the station building converted for farm use, loading banks, a turntable pit, the <b>old</b> <b>rail</b> cement discharge silos {{at the southern end of}} the yard (used when cement was transported by rail for the Roxburgh dam construction), and even the concrete stop block that signified the end of the branch.|$|E
2500|$|For a {{small boat}} (e.g. 22' / 6.7 m sailing yacht), this might consist of a heavy weight on the seabed, a 12mm or 14mm rising chain {{attached}} to the [...] "anchor", and a bridle made from 20mm nylon rope, steel cable, or a 16mm combination steel wire material. [...] The heavy weight (anchor) should be a dense material. [...] <b>Old</b> <b>rail</b> wagon wheels are used in some places (e.g. Clontarf, Dublin, Ireland) for this purpose. [...] In some harbours (e.g. Dun Laoghaire, Ireland), very heavy chain (e.g. old ship anchor chain) may {{be placed in a}} grid pattern on the sea bed to ensure orderly positioning of moorings. [...] Ropes (particularly for marker buoys and messenger lines) should be [...] "non floating" [...] to reduce likelihood of a boat's prop being fouled by one.|$|E

Use of the UTA right of way for the line was challenged in court and later approved by the Utah Supreme Court on July 12, 2008. UTA published a draft Environmental Impact Statement for the new line that names the UTA right of way as the preferred route. The extension's first phase, which includes [...] and three new stations, opened on August 18, 2013.

2500|$|A new Santa Susana Pass wagon route {{bypassing}} the deteriorating Devil's Slide was opened in 1895 to the north. Initially called El Camino Nuevo (the New Road), {{it was later}} named the Chatsworth Grade Road, which continued in use until Santa Susana Pass Road (now Old Santa Susana Pass Road) was built in 1917. This was the first automobile route between the San Fernando and Simi Valleys. It also was the main northbound 'coast road' to Santa Barbara and San Francisco, until the Conejo Grade in Ventura County between Conejo Valley and the Oxnard Plain on [...] "Camino Real Viejo" [...] (the Old Royal Road, now U.S. Route 101), was improved. Rail traffic through Toluca and Chatsworth Park to Ventura County and points north {{was made possible by}} the opening of the Santa Susana Tunnels in 1904, and the new coast route soon superseded the <b>old</b> <b>rail</b> route to San Francisco via the San Fernando Pass for passenger travel, as that route had superseded the stagecoach route via Santa Susana Pass in the 1870s.|$|E
2500|$|The Metrodome was {{constructed}} {{in an area of}} downtown Minneapolis known as [...] "Industry Square". Development in the Downtown East neighborhood around Metrodome took many years to materialize. For many years, there were few bars or restaurants nearby where fans could gather, and tailgating was expressly forbidden in most parking areas. The City of Minneapolis was directing the development of the entertainment districts along Seven Corners in Cedar-Riverside, Hennepin Avenue, and the Warehouse district. The Metrodome existed among a number of parking areas built upon <b>old</b> <b>rail</b> yards, along with defunct factories and warehouses. The Star Tribune owns a number of blocks nearby that have remained parking lots. The Metrodome was not connected to the Minneapolis Skyway System, although that had been proposed in 1989 to be completed in time to host Super Bowl XXVI. The Star Tribune properties, and the Minneapolis Armory never have been developed, and stood between the Metrodome and the rest of Downtown Minneapolis. Only in recent years did redevelopment begin moving Southeast to reach the Metrodome. More restaurants, hotels, and condominiums have been built nearby. The METRO Blue Line light rail connected the Minneapolis entertainment district with the Metrodome and the Airport.|$|E
