5|$|Antibodies can {{continue}} {{to be an effective}} defence mechanism even after viruses have managed to gain entry to the host cell. A protein that is in cells, called TRIM21, can attach to the antibodies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virus particle. This primes the subsequent destruction of the virus by the enzymes of the cell's proteosome system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{increase}} the magnetic performance of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) /Fe 3 O 4 nanocomposites, Fe 3 O 4 -polymer-MWCNTs {{with a novel}} nanostructure was prepared by in-situ method. The low molecular weight poly (acrylic acid) was grafted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> acid-oxidized MWCNTs, forming numerous carboxyl groups from the original hydroxyl groups <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> acid-treated MWCNTs. And then, the ferric and ferrous ions would be adsorbed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> PAA-g-MWCNTs through <b>the</b> electrostatic interaction. At last, the ammonia solution was added into the above solution to form Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> MWCNTs through hydrothermal treatment. The experimental results showed that large quantities of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles were coated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> PAA-g-MWCNTs via in-situ method and our products possessed high magnetic saturation and magnetic sensitivity...|$|R

5|$|The IgG {{antibodies}} form {{a complex}} with heparin and PF4 in the bloodstream. The {{tail of the}} antibody then binds to the FcγIIa receptor, a protein <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> platelet.

40|$|The {{reaction}} of ANCA with ANCA antigens <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> neutrophils {{may play a}} critical role in the pathogenesis of ANCA vasculitis. Therefore, an understanding of the circumstances that result in <b>surface</b> expression <b>of</b> these antigens is important for an understanding of pathogenic mechanisms. In this study we investigated <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> expression <b>of</b> ANCA antigens on quiescent, primed, and apoptotic neutrophils. ANCA antigens and other granule constituents were not detected <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> neutrophils in freshly heparinized blood. ANCA antigens were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> neutrophils primed by in vitro incubation for 4 h and 8 h. These cells did not show evidence of apoptosis. After 24 h incubation, about 30 % of the neutrophils were apoptotic, and ANCA antigens and other granule constituents were present <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> both apoptotic and non-apoptotic cells. Our data indicate that there are no ANCA antigens <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> quiescent neutrophils, but that they are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> primed neutrophils before the cells become apoptotic, and remain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> cells after they become apoptotic. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that ANCA can react in vivo with primed but not quiescent neutrophils. Previously published observations indicate that the interaction of ANCA with primed neutrophils results in neutrophil activation, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of ANCA vasculitis...|$|R

5|$|The {{heart has}} four chambers, two upper atria, the {{receiving}} chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers.

This distinction is visible also <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart as the coronary sulcus. There is an ear-shaped structure in the upper right atrium called the right atrial appendage, or auricle, and another in the upper left atrium, the left atrial appendage. The right atrium and the right ventricle together are {{sometimes referred to as}} the right heart. Similarly, the left atrium and the left ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the left heart. The ventricles are separated from each other by the interventricular septum, visible <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart as the anterior longitudinal sulcus and the posterior interventricular sulcus.|$|E

30|$|In summary, the {{formation}} of NiO nanoparticles <b>on</b> MWNTs with <b>the</b> wet chemical method was studied. The chemical impregnation process led to homogenously dispersed NiO nanoparticles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> FMWNTs, and <b>the</b> particles were found to possess an average size of 5 – 60  nm. The presence <b>of</b> nickel oxide <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> MWNTs causes to increase <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> roughness.

Flow marks are marks left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> casting due to poor gating, sharp corners, or excessive lubricant.|$|E

5|$|Attachment is {{the binding}} {{of the virus}} to {{specific}} molecules <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cell. This specificity restricts the virus to a very limited type of cell. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects only human T cells, because its surface protein, gp120, can only react with CD4 and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can only attach to plant cells and cannot infect animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells {{in which they are}} capable of reproducing.|$|E
5|$|Calcium oxalate is {{a common}} {{crystalline}} compound found in many fungi, including the earthstars. The presence of calcium oxalate crystals—apparent as a whitish powder <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spore sac—has been verified for G.pectinatum using scanning electron microscopy. The calcium oxalate crystals occur in the tetragonal form, known as weddellite. A study on the related species Geastrum saccatum has shown that these crystals {{are responsible for the}} characteristic opening (dehiscence) of the outer peridial layers. The formation of calcium oxalate crystals stretches the layers of the outer walls, pushing apart the inner and outer layers of the peridium.|$|E
