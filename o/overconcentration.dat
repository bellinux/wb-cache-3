By using the classical definition of kLa, the global volumetric {{mass transfer}} coefficient, theoretical development of mass balances in such processes {{demonstrates that the}} mass transfer of highly soluble gases is not limited in the usual conditions occurring in anaerobic fermentors (low-intensity mixing). Conversely, the limitation is important for poorly soluble gases, such as methane and hydrogen. The latter could be overconcentrated {{to as much as}} 80 times the value at thermodynamic equilibrium. Such <b>overconcentrations</b> bring into question the biological interpretations that have been deduced solely from gaseous measurements. Experimental results obtained in three different methanogenic reactors {{for a wide range of}} conditions of mixing and gas production confirmed the general existence of low mass transfer coefficients and consequently of large <b>overconcentrations</b> of dissolved methane and hydrogen (up to 12 and 70 times the equilibrium values, respectively). Hydrogen mass transfer coefficients were obtained from the direct measurements of dissolved and gaseous concentrations, while carbon dioxide coefficients were calculated from gas phase composition and calculation of related dissolved concentration. Methane transfer coefficients were based on calculations from the carbon dioxide coefficients. From mass balances performed on a gas bubble during its simulated growth and ascent to the surface of the liquid, the methane and carbon dioxide contents in the gas bubble appeared to be controlled by the bubble growth process, while the bubble ascent was largely responsible for a slight enrichment in hydrogen...|$|R

Of the 890 time series in this project, 256 were statistically significant trends, 228 (89 %) of these were downward trends and 28 were upwards. In 142 cases concentrations were above what is expected in only diffusely contaminated areas (collectively termed <b>overconcentrations).</b> The results showed elevated levels of contaminants, in a few cases up to extremely polluted, in blue mussel in the Frierfjord (dioxins/TCDDN), in the Ranfjord (B[a]P) and in the Sørfjord (ppDDE). Blue mussel in the Kristiansandsfjord and the Ranfjord were up to severely polluted with B[a]P. Cod liver from Inner Oslofjord was markedly polluted, and the fillet was moderately polluted with PCBs. There was a significant downward trend for PCBs in blue mussel from Gressholmen in the Inner Oslofjord. Fillet of cod from the Inner Oslofjord was moderately polluted with mercury, a significant upward trend was detected for the period 1984 - 2008. A significant downward trend was found for lead, cadmium and mercury in blue mussel from Sørfjord/ Hardangerfjord. Fillet of cod from the Inner Sørfjord was moderately polluted with mercury, and cod liver was insignificantly polluted with ppDDE and PCBs. Fillet of ling from the Inner Sørfjord had a median concentration of mercury of 0. 48 mg/kg, which is close to the lower limit of Class IV (severely polluted). Fillet of both tusk and ling from the Høyanger area were moderately contaminated with mercury. Contamination of organotin in blue mussel and imposex in dogwhelk were still apparent, however, most of the trends were downwards indicating that regulatory action has lead to an improvement in the investigated areas. The results from studies using biological effects methods in cod, indicated reduced exposure to planar organic contaminants in the Oslofjord. In the Grenlandsfjord area there was a significant downward trend for HCB in blue mussel. No <b>overconcentrations</b> of contaminants were found in prawns.

Explaining the good quality of an on-plane electrostatic rendering {{turns out to be a}} rather hard exercise because of the refined composition of arguments that the subject carries along behind it. These need careful attention, as that paid to the greatest possible extent in the present treatment, in order to set up an indispensable theoretical background preparatory to any future experimental validation. We are very hopeful that this outcome can be reached with the stipulation that the exposed body is embedded in a suitably pre-ionized airspace. Accordingly, a suitable radon-originated air ionization scenario, internally to a closed space, is envisaged and discussed in the present stage of the investigation. The radon concentration needed to trigger and control interspersed corona activity is carefully examined. This activity results in a typical accelerated-aging surface agent for fabric and other dielectric materials. The given physicochemical degradation is here assumed as being directly implied, under prescribed conditions, even in the special image formation pertaining to the Shroud of Turin. Perhaps, the most striking prediction made in the paper is that, under tectonic conditions which are usually met in a number of radon-prone areas, radon <b>overconcentrations</b> can attain and exceed the level related to the discharge onset.

40|$|Agents {{use their}} {{knowledge}} {{on the history}} of the economy in order to choose what is the optimal action to take at any given moment of time, but each individual observes history with some noise. This paper shows that the amount of information available on the past evolution of the economy is an endogenous variable, and that this leads to <b>overconcentration</b> of the investment, which can be interpreted as underinvestment in research. It presents a model in which agents have to invest at each period in one of $K$ sectors, each of them paying an exogenous return that follows a well defined stochastic path. At any moment of time each agent receives an unbiased noisy signal on the payoff of each sector. The signals differ across agents, but all of them have the same variance, which depends on the aggregate investment in that particular sector (so that if almost everybody invests in it the perceptions of everybody will be very accurate, but if almost nobody does the perceptions of everybody will be very noisy). The degree of hetereogeneity across agents is then an endogenous variable, evolving across time determining, and being determined by, the amount of information disclosed. As long as both the level of social interaction and the underlying precision of the observations are relatively large agents behave in a very precise way. This behavior is unmodified for a huge range of informational parameters, and it is characterized by an excessive concentration of the investment in a few sectors. Additionally the model shows that generalized improvements in the quality of the information that each agent gets may lead to a worse outcome for all the agents due to the <b>overconcentration</b> of the investment that this produces. ...|$|E

It is based on an <b>overconcentration</b> step that makes it possible to replace the spray-drying step used in conventional processes. This innovative processing scheme includes: (1) <b>overconcentration</b> of the permeate concentrate from 60 to 80 % w/w dry matter (DM) content; (2) granulation of the overconcentrate with powder up to 88 % DM; and (3) drying of the granules up to 97 % DM. The feasibility of the process was validated at the pilot scale and the properties of the resulting permeate powder were comparable to those of a powder produced using the conventional process. Consideringwater removal, the energy savings in comparison to the conventional process were estimated in the range of 10. 7 to 23. 5 %, and up to 32 % when considering the whole production process or the drying step alone, respectively. Industrial relevance: The global demand ofwhey and permeate powders has considerably grownover the past decade, especially due to the increasing production of infant milk powders. The transformation of a liquid product into a powder requires a high energy-consuming drying step and energy savings on the current technology, i. e., spray drying, are difficult to achieve sincemost of the energy is used forwater removal. One solution is to develop a disruptive technology allowing the production of powders without spray drying, as proposed and described in this paper. The new process scheme is composed of three thin-film rotary evaporators in series, specifically designed to handle highly viscous products. The feasibility of the process was validated at the pilot scale and the results showed that it leads to significant savings on energy and building requirements for a quality of powder at least equivalent to a standard powder produced using conventional technologies...|$|E

This result is strengthened when the output of a financial sector is enlarged to two jointly produced goods, capital and information, and when the information and transaction costs involved in the production of those two goods are taken into account. The main conclusion of this paper is that there may be conflicts between the pursuit of the greatest efficiency per se of a financial sector and the pursuit of the greatest efficiency in regard to economic development. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceA new {{technique}} is {{reported for the}} enhanced colonmetric detection of multiplexed hybridization onto porous membrane-based microarrays. This approach combines the use of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as a label together with a chromogen substrate and a local production of the hydrogen peroxide required for substrate oxidation. This in situ production of coreagent is obtained using glucose oxidase (GOx) directly immobilized within the microarray porous membrane mesh. The oxidation of glucose by the immobilized GOx produces hydrogen peroxide which itself enables the oxidation of TMB (3, 3 ', 5, 5 '-tetramethylbenzidine) by HRP and yields a blue precipitate on positive spots. Thanks to a coreagent <b>overconcentration</b> within the membrane, this design drastically surpasses the performances of the standard TMB/H(2) O(2) kit used for peroxidase label detection. The obtained target limit of detection is then 50 times lower (20 pM) than the one obtained with the standard kit approach, and the dynamic range expands at least one decade. Furthermore, the developed method was shown to compete well with the widely used alkaline phosphatase-BCIP (5 -bromo 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl phosphate) /NBT (nitro blue tetrazolium chloride) readout while minimizing background signal. The method was finally successfully applied to the multiplex detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in complex PCR samples.

40|$|Abstract: The {{link between}} credit risk {{and the current}} {{financial}} crisis accentuates the importance of measuring and predicting extreme credit risk. Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is a method used widely in the insurance industry to measure extreme risk, and has also gained popularity {{as a measure of}} extreme market risk. We combine the CVaR market approach with the Merton / KMV credit model to generate a model measuring credit risk under extreme market conditions. The Merton / KMV model is a popular model used by Banks to predict probability of default (PD) of customers based on movements in the market value of assets. The model uses option pricing methodology to estimate distance to default (DD) based on movements in the market value of assets. This model has been popularized among Banks for measuring credit risk by KMV who use the DD approach of Merton but apply their extensive default data base to modify PD outcomes. Our extreme credit model is used to compare default risk among sectors in an Australian setting. An in depth understanding of sectoral risk is vital to Banks to ensure that there is not an <b>overconcentration</b> of credit risk in any sector.

We investigated this issue by using human and mouse phosphoproteome data. We initially found that phosphoproteins followed a power-law distribution with regard to their number of phosphosites: most of the proteins included only a few phosphosites, but some included dozens of phosphosites. The power-law distribution, unlike more commonly observed distributions such as normal and log-normal distributions, is considered by the field of complex systems science to be produced by a specific rich-get-richer process called preferential attachment growth. Therefore, we explored the factors that may have promoted the rich-get-richer process during phosphosite evolution. We conducted a bioinformatics analysis to evaluate the relationship of amino acid sequences of phosphoproteins with the positions of phosphosites and found an <b>overconcentration</b> of phosphosites in specific regions of protein surfaces and implications that in many phosphoproteins these clusters of phosphosites are activated simultaneously. Multiple phosphosites concentrated in limited spaces on phosphoprotein surfaces may therefore function biologically as cooperative modules that are resistant to selective pressures during phosphoprotein evolution. We therefore proposed a hypothetical model by which the modularization of multiple phosphosites has been resistant to natural selection and has driven the rich-get-richer process of the evolutionary growth of phosphosite numbers...|$|E

It is, however, far from the reality: Membrane proteins can assemble into so-called microdomains (sometimes called lipid rafts) which also display a specific lipid composition. We propose a simple mechanism that is able to explain the colocalization of protein and lipid rafts. Results Using very simple mathematical models and particle simulations, we show that a variation of membrane viscosity directly leads to variation of the local concentration of diffusive particles. Since specific lipid phases in the membrane can account for diffusion variation, we show that, in such a situation, the freely diffusing proteins (or any other component) still undergo a Brownian motion but concentrate in areas of lower diffusion. The amount of this so-called <b>overconcentration</b> at equilibrium issimply related to the ratio of diffusion coefficients between zones {{of high and low}} diffusion. Expanding the model to include particle interaction, we show that inhomogeneous diffusion can impact particles clusterization as well. The clusters of particles were more numerous and appear for a lower value of interaction strength in the zones of low diffusion compared to zones of high diffusion. Conclusion Provided we assume stable viscosity heterogeneity in the membrane, our model propose a simple mechanism to explain particle concentration heterogeneity. It has also a non-trivial impact on density of particles when interaction is added. This could potentially have an impact on membrane chemical reactions and oligomerization. </p...|$|E
40|$|Resources {{for mental}} health include policy and {{infrastructure}} within countries, mental health services, community resources, human resources, and funding. We discuss here the general availability of these resources, especially in low-income and middle-income countries. Government spending on mental health {{in most of the}} relevant countries is far lower than is needed, based on the proportionate burden of mental disorders and the availability of cost-effective and affordable interventions. The poorest countries spend the lowest percentages of their overall health budgets on mental health. Most care is now institutionally based, and the transition to community care would require additional funds that have not been made available in most countries. Human resources available {{for mental health}} care in most low-income and middle-income countries are very limited, and shortages are likely to persist. Not only are resources for mental health scarce, they are also inequitably distributed-between countries, between regions, and within communities. Populations with high rates of socioeconomic deprivation have the highest need for mental health care, but the lowest access to it. Stigma about mental disorders also constrains use of available resources. People with mental illnesses are also vulnerable to abuse of their human rights. Inefficiencies in the use of available resources for mental health care include allocative and technical inefficiencies in financing mechanisms and interventions, and an <b>overconcentration</b> of resources in large institutions. Scarcity of available resources, inequitles in their distribution, and inefficiencies in their use pose the three main obstacles to better mental health, especially in low-income and middle-income countries...|$|E
40|$|Over the years, Nigeria have {{witnessed}} different government with different policy measures. Against {{the negative consequences}} of the past policies, the structural adjustment was initiated in 1986. Its aims is to effectively altar and restructure the consumption patterns of the economy as well as to eliminate price distortions and heavy dependence on the oil and the imports of consumer goods and services. Within the period of implementation, there has been a decreasing trend in yearly fish catch landings and sizes but the reverse in shrimping. There is also a gradual shift from fishing to shrimping, from the vessels purchased with 83. 3 % increase of shrimpers from 1985 to 1989. Decreasing fish catch sizes and quantity aggravated by the present high cost of fishing coupled with the favourable export market for Nigeria shrimp tend to influence the sift. This economic situation {{is the result of the}} supply measures of SAP through the devaluation of the Naira. There is also <b>overconcentration</b> of vessels on the inshore waters as majority of the vessels are old and low powers hence incapable of fishing on the deep sea. Rotterdam price being paid for automotive gas oil (AGO) by fishing industries is observed to be discriminating and unhealthy to the growth of the industry as it is exceedingly high and unstable thus affecting planning for fishing operation. Fuel alone takes 43 % of the total cost of operation. The overall consequences is that fishing days are loss and therefore higher overhead cost. It was concluded that for a healthy growth and sustainable resources of our marine fishery under the structural adjustment programme licensing of new fishing vessels should be stopped immediately and the demand side of SAP should be employed by subsidizing high powered fishing vessels which can operate effectively on the deep se...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognised}} that many people with poorly controlled epilepsy suffer from significant inter-ictal psychosocial problems. Yet there is little consensus on appropriate treatment for such difficulties. It is argued {{that this has been}} due to an <b>overconcentration</b> on seizure control in treatment practice and a lack of professional agreement on potential aetiological factors or of consistent appropriate definitions of psychological and social difficulties. Recent research on patients' perceptions of their condition has indicated that such perceptions may be a more potent predictor of psychosocial functioning than objective information such as seizure type or frequency. If such perceptions were found to vary in a consistent and predictable manner, this would have considerable assessment and treatment implications. Analysis was made of the literature on patient perceptions. Four main conceptual areas were implicated: The perceived social effects of epilepsy, the perceived physical effects of epilepsy, perceived control over epilepsy and its effects, and knowledge of epilepsy. From this analysis a hypothetical `perception of epilepsy' model was developed: From this, it was suggested that patients' perceptions vary between `adaptive' perceptions, and `maladaptive' perceptions. It was proposed that `adaptive' perceptions were typified by good knowledge, high efficacy beliefs, high perceived control over seizures and health related behaviours, low fear of seizures and low perceived social limitations imposed by epilepsy. Conversely, `maladaptive' beliefs were typified by poor knowledge, low efficacy beliefs, external control beliefs, high perceived social limitations and high fear of seizures. It was hypothesised that if this model proved to be valid, the more maladaptive an individual's perception, the greater the psychosocial risk. A further supplementary hypothesis was made concerning `underadaptive' perceptions which, it was speculated, would result in passivity and dependency...|$|E
