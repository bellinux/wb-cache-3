25|$|In late 1966, {{the then}} Secretary for Chinese Affairs, John McDouall, retired to the United Kingdom and Holmes {{was chosen to}} succeed the post which McDouall had served for a decade. Nevertheless, {{at the time of}} his {{promotion}} the Cultural Revolution had just broken out in the mainland China and the situation of Hong Kong had become increasingly unstable. In the following year, Hong Kong was finally hit by the outbreak of the 1967 Leftist Riots, a series of riots which was triggered by a labour dispute. During the disorder, Governor Sir David Trench happened to be absent from Hong Kong and all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>there</b> was no one fully in command of the government. As a result, then Colonial Secretary, Sir Michael Gass, became acting-Governor and Holmes became acting-Colonial Secretary, and therefore it was Holmes and Gass who were in charge in the crisis. At the beginning of the riot, there were only general strikes in Hong Kong but the situation worsened quickly when the Communists started to put pipe bombs on the streets. The presence of pipe bombs was a big blow to Hong Kong as it roused public fear, while the British government and the Hong Kong government secretly discussed whether or not to abandon the Crown Colony. It was said that Holmes strongly resisted the idea of retreat in the Executive Council, and he successfully persuaded the British to stay. Under the leadership of Holmes, the government adopted a hard-line policy towards the Communists and called on the general public to denounce the leftists. Finally, the rioting ended in late 1967, and the tough stance held by Holmes was deeply appreciated by the government.|$|E

Whilst Noel and his friends did not think Oasis sounded {{particularly}} spectacular, he did begin {{to consider the possibility}} of using his brother's group as a possible outlet for a series of songs he had been writing for several years. Noel approached the group about joining with the proviso that he would become the band's sole songwriter and leader, and that they would commit to an earnest pursuit of commercial success. [...] "He had loads of stuff written," [...] Arthurs recalled. [...] "When he walked in, we were a band making a racket with four tunes.

Regina sends the two into another room, where she uses purple dust to hold Cora off, but Regina's power wears off, which allows Cora to easily knock Regina aside and possess Mary Margaret, who now sees what happened in Cora's past. However, Regina refuses to let Mary Margaret die, so she uses her magic to remove Cora from Mary's body and sends her back to the realm of the dead. Afterwards, Mary Margaret mumbles out the reasons behind Cora giving up Zelena. As she comes to, Belle, along with Emma, Hook, and David, enters. Then, Belle reveals why Zelena needs Regina's Heart, David's Courage and Mr. Gold's Brain: Zelena is planning to create a time-travel spell, in which Zelena is planning {{to go back to the}} past and prevent Eva from being born so Cora would have never given her up and then eventually be the one Rumplestiltskin tutors for magic and by doing so Snow White/Mary Margaret will never be born, and in the process would mean that not only will Emma and Henry never exist, but Regina will no longer exist as well. David then realizes that Zelena still needs a baby to enact the spell and she believes that's why Zelena is trying to accelerate the pregnancy of Mary Margaret, in order to cast the spell. The revelations result in Regina and Mary Margaret putting aside any differences they had in the past, as Mary Margaret tells a tearful Regina “I know you, and you feel things deeply,” regardless <b>of</b> having <b>a</b> heart or not.
