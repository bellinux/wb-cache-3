Augmentations are usually unidirectional, either reflecting virtual contents on the user’s body (Situated Augmented Reality) or augmenting user’s reflections with digital contents (AR mirrors).

40|$|A proven {{solution}} for the on-line monitoring of the gap in remote fibre laser welding of overlapped zinc-coated steel {{is based on the}} analysis of the visible optical emission that the welding process generates. Traditionally, different monitoring approaches are used, such as monitoring the overall emission or parts of the emission with filtered photodiodes or spectroscopic analysis of the wavelength domain. In the monitoring of welding defects, these approaches can lead to different performance results. In the present paper, different methods to monitor and analyse the visible emission are compared. The monitoring strategy uses an hardware known as Through the <b>Optical</b> <b>Combiner</b> Monitoring (TOCM) that allows the signal emitted by the welding to be acquired directly at the laser source. The paper aims to evaluate the ability of monitoring methods to identify the effects of variable factors, such as the gap between the plates and the location inside the weld seam at which the variation of the gap occurs, on the monitored emission. The optical emission from 400 nm to 800 nm is monitored during remote laser welding from the <b>optical</b> <b>combiner</b> of the fibre laser source. Firstly, the entire optical emission is examined with a spectroscope with a wavelength resolution of 0. 57 nm. Secondly, multivariate data analysis is used to evaluate different indicators, such as the overall emission in the considered range, the emissions in separated wavelength ranges according to physical evaluations of the welding process or the entire spectrum.

40|$|A free-space <b>optical</b> beam <b>combiner</b> now {{undergoing}} development {{makes it}} possible to use the outputs of multiple multimode laser diodes to pump a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) non-planar ring oscillator (NPRO) laser while ensuring that the laser operates at only a single desired frequency. Heretofore, a Nd:YAG NPRO like the present one has been pumped by a single multimode laser-diode beam delivered via an optical fiber. It would be desirable to use multiple pump laser diodes to increase reliability beyond that obtainable from a single pump laser diode. However, as explained in this article, simplistically coupling multiple multimode laser-diode beams through a fiber-optic combiner would entail a significant reduction in coupling efficiency, and lasing would occur at one or more other frequencies in addition to the single desired frequency. To minimize coupling loss, one must ensure that the NA (approximately equal to 0. 3) of the combined laser-diode beams is less than the NA of the fiber. The A(Omega) of the laser-diode beam in the slow-axis plane is 1 / 1. 3 as large as that of the fiber. This A(Omega) is small enough to enable efficient coupling of light into the optical fiber, but too large for combining of beams in the slow-axis plane. Therefore, a pair of cylindrical lenses is used to cancel the slow-axis plane magnification introduced by the on-cylindrical lenses used to effect magnification in the fast-axis plane...|$|R
40|$|A {{breadboard}} {{version of}} an <b>optical</b> beam <b>combiner</b> is depicted which {{make it possible to}} use the outputs of any or all of four multimode laser diodes to pump a non-planar ring oscillator (NPRO) laser. The output of each laser diode has a single-mode profile in the meridional plane containing an axis denoted the 'fast' axis and a narrower multimode profile in the orthogonal meridional plane, which contains an axis denoted the 'slow' axis and a narrower multimode profile in the orthogonal meridional plane, which contains an axis denoted the 'slow' axis. One of the purposes served by the beam-combining optics is to reduce the fast-axis numerical aperture (NA) of the laser-diode output to match the NA of the optical fiber. Along the slow axis, the unmodified laser-diode NA is already well matched to the fiber optic NA, so no further slow-axis beam shaping is needed. In this beam combiner, the laser-diode outputs are collimated by aspherical lenses, then half-wave plates and polarizing beam splitters are used to combine the four collimated beams into two beams. Spatial combination of the two beams and coupling into the optical fiber is effected by use of anamorphic prisms, mirrors, and a focusing lens. The anamorphic prisms are critical elements in the NA-matching scheme, in that they reduce the fast-axis beam width to 1 / 6 of its original values. Inasmuch as no slow-axis beam shaping is needed, the collimating and focusing lenses are matched for 1 : 1 iumaging. Because these lenses are well corrected for infinite conjugates the combiner offers diffraction-limited performance along both the fast and slow axes...|$|R

The {{purpose of the}} developed LPM is to reliably pump an Nd:YAG crystal in the laser head (LH), which serves as the optical metrology source for SIMLite mission. Using the narrow-linewidth, single-mode laser diodes enables placement of the pump power near Nd adsorption peak, which enhances pumping efficiency. Grating stabilization allows for stable pump spectra as diode operating temperature and bias current change. The low-loss, high-port-count <b>optical</b> <b>combiner</b> enables efficient combining of tens of pumps. Overall, the module supports 5 + years of continuous operation at 2 W of pump power with reliability approaching 100 percent. The LPM consists of a laser diode farm (LDF) and a pump beam combiner (PBC). An array of 807 - to 808 -nm fiber-pigtailed laser diodes makes up the LDF. A Bragg grating in each 5 - m core single-mode (SM) fiber pigtail acts to stabilize the lasing spectra over a range of diode operating conditions. These commercially available single-mode laser diodes can deliver up to 150 mW of optical power. The outputs from the multiple pumps in the LDF are routed to the PBC, which is a 37 -input by 1 -output all-fiber device.

40|$|Thanks to {{the recent}} {{affirmation}} of the active fiber lasers, remote laser welding of zinc coated steels is under investigation with a particular emphasis on the overlap joint geometry. Due to the high power and high beam quality offered by these lasers, the remote laser welding process has become more practicable. However laser welding of lap zinc coated steels is still problematic because of the violent vaporisation of zinc. The presence of {{a gap between the}} plates allowing vapour degassing has been proven to avoid defects due to zinc vaporization.. On the other hand variation in the gap value can lead to the welding defect formation. Therefore constant gap values should be ensured and deviation from the reference gap value has to be monitored during the execution of the welding process. Furthermore, the on-line monitoring of the gap values between the plates can be helpful for the on-line quality control of the welding process. The paper proposes a new monitoring solution for the measurement of the gap in remote fiber laser welding of overlapped zinc coated steels. In this solution, referred as Through the <b>Optical</b> <b>Combiner</b> Monitoring (TOCM), the optical emissions from the welding process are directly observed through the <b>optical</b> <b>combiner</b> of the fiber laser source with spectroscopic equipment.

After the definition of the right welding process conditions, spectroscopic tests are exploited to evaluate the optical emission from the welding plasma/plume. Acquired spectra are then analysed with multivariate data analysis approach in order to ensure gap monitoring. Results showed that with the proposed method it is possible to evaluate not only the gap between the plates but also the location inside the weld at which the variation occurs. Furthermore, the relationship between the gap variation and local changes in the acquired spectra is given...|$|E

Heretofore, an Nd:YAG NPRO like the present one has been pumped by a single multimode laser-diode beam delivered via an optical fiber. It would be desirable to use multiple pump laser diodes to increase reliability beyond that obtainable from a single pump laser diode. However, as explained below, simplistically coupling multiple multimode laser-diode beams through a fiber-optic combiner would entail a significant reduction in coupling efficiency, and lasing would occur at one or more other frequencies in addition to the single desired frequency. Figure 1 schematically illustrates the principle of operation of a laser-diode-pumped Nd:YAG NPRO. The laser beam path is confined in a Nd:YAG crystal by means of total internal reflections on the three back facets and a partial-reflection coating on the front facet.

A thermal lens effect induced by the pump beam enables stable lasing in the lowest-order transverse electromagnetic mode (the TEM 00 mode). The frequency of this laser is very stable because of the mechanical stability of the laser crystal and the unidirectional nature of the lasing.

A novel architecture for a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor based on a silicon nitride slab waveguide structure was proposed and studied. Industrial aspects and feasibility for the practical sensor design of the introduced concept were considered. As a main result a proof-of-concept was shown by demonstrating the device sensitivity to humidity. A surface plasmon sensor fabricated with a silicon nitride waveguide technology has applications as a chemical and biochemical sensor. A thermally tunable integrated optical ring resonator device was developed to study the optical characteristics of a ring resonator, waveguide quality, and electrical characteristics of thermo-optical control with in situ temperature sensing.

The thermal control was implemented by using poly-silicon resistive heaters integrated {{on top of the}} waveguide layer. The thermal tuning was demonstrated to be a feasible tool for an accurate optical phase control. The measured temperature coefficient of Si 3 N 4 rib waveguide can be applied in the design of future devices based on similar structures.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} the process stability and avoid local defects in laser metal deposition (LMD), it is required to have a greater control over the process parameters such as laser power and speed. For this reason, among the various detectable indicators of the process, one of the most relevant is the optical emission. A small wavelength portion of the light emitted by the process can be correlated to the process temperature being used as a feedback signal to control process parameters. To this purpose firstly, it is preferable to employ a remote sensing strategy to maintain the high flexibility of the motion system so as not to limit the process head movement. Secondly, a coaxial monitoring approach is more advantageous compared to an off-axis one since it allows observing the process directly without the requirement to be reoriented at any head motion which is key point if the objective is observing the molten pool. This paper describes and exploits the advantage of the coaxial and remote sensing of the temperature based on optical signals acquired through the <b>optical</b> <b>combiner</b> (TOC) of the multimode fiber laser. In the work, the adequate optical emission zone is defined and required optical arrangement is studied. The sensing system is applied to monitor temperature in laser metal deposition of 3 D free form during the realization of a thin wall structure. The capabilities of the instrument to detect local process variations of the temperature due to speed variation in correspondence of transient positioner settlements are demonstrated. Signal characteristics of process irregularities are defined and compared with one deriving from a lateral placed thermal camera. ...|$|E
40|$|From humble {{beginnings}} in 2008, a group met {{to propose}} {{the idea of}} observing the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) {{in order to determine}} its polarisation properties, i. e. E- and B-modes. B-modes, a smoking gun for inflation theory, are a long sought after observation for cosmologists. From this the QUBIC collaboration was born. Here we explore the scientific justification for such a mission and the aims of the QUBIC telescope in furthering this knowledge with emphasis on the author’s contribution to this end. B-modes are far fainter than any other signal that cosmology has attempted detection of before making them a challenge and requiring a new type of telescope with exceptional sensitivity and control of systematics. The author was heavily involved in the design and analysis of the <b>optical</b> <b>combiner</b> here at the Department of Experimental Physics in Maynooth University. This thesis describes the analysis techniques used for the characterisation of the operation of the QUBIC instrument. These techniques: TE/TM mode matching, Gaussian beam mode analysis and physical optics were used in determination of the behaviour of the instrument in 2 bands, 150 GHz and 220 GHz with 25 % bandwidth in each case. The analysis was done mainly using 2 software packages, SCATTER and MODAL, both of which are in-house developments and as such offer customisation of their capabilities. QUBIC required detailed analysis which led to design modifications and allowed for confident design of new elements for inclusion in the optical-combiner. I present an optical design for QUBIC, a bolometric interferometer for cosmology which, at the time printing, is under construction awaiting shipping to Dome-C Antarctica to commence observation...|$|E
40|$|A head-mounted-display with an <b>optical</b> <b>combiner</b> may {{introduce}} {{significant amount}} of distortion {{to the real world}} scene. The ability to accurately model the effects of both 2 -dimensional and 3 -dimensional distortion introduced by thick optical elements has many uses in the development of head-mounted display systems and applications. For instance, the computer rendering system must be able to accurately model this distortion and provide accurate compensation in the virtual path in order to provide a seamless overlay between the virtual and real world scenes. In this paper, we present a ray tracing method that determines the ray shifts and deviations introduced by a thick optical element giving us the ability to generate correct computation models for rendering a virtual object in 3 D space with the appropriate amount of distortion. We also demonstrate how a Hartmann wavefront sensor approach can be used to evaluate the manufacturing errors in a freeform optical element to better predict wavefront distortion. A classic Hartmann mask is used as an inexpensive and easily manufacturable solution for accurate wavefront measurements. This paper further suggests two techniques; by scanning the Hartmann mask laterally to obtain dense sampling and by increasing the view screen distance to the testing aperture, for improving the slope measurement accuracy and resolution. The paper quantifies the improvements of these techniques on measuring both the high and low sloped wavefronts often seen in freeform optical-see-through head-mounted displays. By comparing the measured wavefront to theoretical wavefronts constructed with ray tracing software, we determine the sources of error within the freeform prism. We also present a testing setup capable of measuring off-axis viewing angles to replicate how the system would perform when worn by its user...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOne of {{the major}} {{challenges}} of modern cosmology is the detection of B-mode polarization anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background. These originate from tensor fluctuations of the metric produced during the inflationary phase. Their detection would therefore constitute a major step towards understanding the primordial Universe. The expected level of these anisotropies is however so small that it requires {{a new generation of}} instruments with high sensitivity and extremely good control of systematic effects. We propose the QUBIC instrument based on the novel concept of bolometric interferometry, bringing together the sensitivity advantages of bolometric detectors with the systematics effects advantages of interferometry. The instrument will directly observe the sky through an array of entry horns whose signals will be combined together using an <b>optical</b> <b>combiner.</b> The whole set-up is located inside a cryostat. Polarization modulation will be achieved using a rotating half-wave plate and the images of the interference fringes will be formed on two focal planes (separated by a polarizing grid) tiled with bolometers. We show that QUBIC can be considered as a synthetic imager, exactly similar to a usual imager but with a synthesized beam formed by the array of entry horns. Scanning the sky provides an additional modulation of the signal and improve the sky coverage shape. The usual techniques of map-making and power spectrum estimation can then be applied. We show that the sensitivity of such an instrument is comparable with that of an imager with the same number of horns. We anticipate a low level of beam-related systematics thanks {{to the fact that the}} synthesized beam is determined by the location of the primary horns. Other systematics should be under good control thanks to an autocalibration technique, specific to our concept, that will permit the accurate determination of most of the instrumental parameters that would otherwise lead to systematics...|$|E
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this thesis is the quasi-optical {{analysis}} of optical systems for experiments {{used to measure}} the polarisation anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background. The polarisation signal is so low and difficult to measure that very accurate modelling and a deep understanding and characterisation of the instruments used to make such measurements is essential. The two instruments investigated in this thesis are the Millimetre-Wave Bolometric Interferometer (MBI) and the Q and U Bolometric Interferometer for Cosmology (QUBIC), both of which are collaborations between institutes in Europe and the United States. A prototype of MBI called MBI- 4 has already been built and has been used for experimental observations. The main aim of this prototype has been to prove the concept of bolometric interferometry for measurements of the CMB. In this thesis the <b>optical</b> <b>combiner</b> of MBI- 4 is designed and modelled in detail, taking into account mechanical tolerances and truncations effects, amongst others. The QUBIC instrument is currently in the design stage, having evolved from both MBI- 4 and BRAIN, an experiment located in Antarctica as a test for a more elaborate instrument. The optical design of QUBIC is also analysed, including a physical optics analysis of lenses, although not in the same detail as MBI- 4. A number of techniques are used in this analysis, including Gaussian beam modes and physical optics, to allow for a complete model of the optical systems to be obtained. As part of this modelling, a mode-matching technique is applied to predict the beam patterns of horn antennas. In this thesis, the technique is extended to include a transition from rectangular to circular waveguide geometries as such a junction occurs in the MBI back-to-back horns. The results obtained in this thesis give a useful insight into the power and usefulness of various optical design and analysis techniques as well as criteria for the successful design of current and future interferometry experiments...|$|E
