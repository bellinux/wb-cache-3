50|$|Spectrum {{terminated}} {{the development}} of <b>Ozarelix,</b> a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone antagonist {{for the treatment of}} benign prostatic hypertrophy in 2010. Other previous drug candidates included ortataxel for the treatment of taxane-refractory tumors, and satraplatin for non-small cell lung cancer.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS. Antagonistic or agonistic analogues of gonadotropin-releasing hormone are {{extensively}} {{used for}} the treatment of advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer. However, the majority of recurrent prostate tumors is androgen independent. This study explored the in vitro effects on DU 145 and PC 3 cell lines, two models of androgenin-dependent prostate cancer, of a fourth generation GnRH antagonist (<b>Ozarelix).</b> METHODS. <b>Ozarelix</b> was added to cultures and toxicity, cell cycle modifications, cell viability and caspase activity were investigated. RESULTS. <b>Ozarelix</b> showed antiproliferative effects and produced an accumulation of cells in G 2 /M cell cycle phase. Apoptosis was related with caspase- 8 -dependent caspase 3 activation with down-regulation of c-FLIP (L) and a sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis linked also to increased expression and activity of death receptors DR 4 / 5 and Fas. CONCLUSIONS. TRAIL-resistant cancer cells can be sensitized to TRAIL by <b>Ozarelix.</b> This effect may be achieved by the activation of apoptotic pathway improving the therapeutic effects in androgen independent tumor cell lines. However, a better understanding of molecular mechanisms by which GnRH antagonists may act in androgen independent models is necessary. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} how {{the structure}} of nanofibers, resulting from interactions between anionic polyelectrolytes and cationic peptides, relies on {{the properties of the}} polyelectrolyte component. By using hyaluronate (H), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), xanthan (X), and <b>ozarelix</b> (O), a cationic decapeptide, we determined the influence of characteristic polyelectrolyte parameters such as size and charge density on the formation of polyelectrolyte–peptide complexes. Transmission electron microscopy of unstained, frozen hydrated, or negatively stained samples revealed that the interaction between different anionic polyelectrolytes and <b>ozarelix</b> {{led to the formation of}} distinctly shaped nanofibers. CMC formed rather flexible structures with alternating thin and thick segments within the nanofibers with diameters ranging from 10 to 16 [*]nm and a length of up to 1 [*]μm. Hyaluronate, a high-molecular-mass molecule, formed extra-long aggregates of more than 5 [*]μm. Individual fibers with a diameter of 8 [*]nm aggregated to bigger strands. The nonlinear polysaccharide xanthan gum led to highly coiled structures. The diameter of the respective nanofibers varied between 15 and 25 [*]nm. Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to determine the binding constants and the thermodynamic parameters of the different polyelectrolyte–peptide complexes. The binding constant, which was of the order of 106 M− 1, indicated a strong binding affinity, but also showed differences among the polyelectrolytes. These differences might be useful for prospective applications as drug delivery systems...|$|E
