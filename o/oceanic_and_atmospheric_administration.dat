40|$|Previous global {{analyses}} projected {{shifts in}} species distributions and maximum fisheries catch potential across ocean basins by 2050 under the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A 1 B. However, these studies did {{not account for}} the effects of changes in ocean biogeochemistry and phytoplankton community structure that affect fish and invertebrate distribution and productivity. This paper uses a dynamic bioclimatic envelope model that incorporates these factors to project distribution and maximum catch potential of 120 species of exploited demersal fish and invertebrates in the Northeast Atlantic. Using projections from the US National <b>Oceanic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administrations</b> (NOAA) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model (ESM 2. 1) under the SRES A 1 B, we project an average rate of distribution-centroid shift of 52 km decade - 1 northwards and 5. 1 m decade- 1 deeper from 2005 to 2050. Ocean acidification and reduction in oxygen content reduce growth performance, increase the rate of range shift, and lower the estimated catch potentials (10 -year average of 2050 relative to 2005) by 2030 relative to simulations without considering these factors. Consideration of phytoplankton community structure may further reduce projected catch potentials by ~ 10. These results highlight the sensitivity of marine ecosystems to biogeochemical changes and the need to incorporate likely hypotheses of their biological and ecological effects in assessing climate change impacts...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a natural}} resource damages case, the Exxon Valdez, "and contrasts {{the use and}} acceptance of market and nonmarket valuation methods in two related sectors: commercial fishing and Alaska native subsistence use of fish and wildlife. Much economic literature focuses on how, in principle, one should value environmental injury. These principles and methods have been codified in the Department of Interior <b>and</b> National <b>Oceanic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>Administration</b> natural resource damage regulations that implement the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. However, these liability rules are fairly new, and thus little evidence exists on the acceptance of valuation methods by the courts and juries. In this regard, the" Exxon Valdez case {{is of particular interest}} because substantial resources were at stake and much of the case went all the way through to a jury verdict. The two major plaintiff classes-commercial fishermen and Alaska natives-are market and nonmarket versions, respectively, of otherwise fairly similar economic sectors. However, the court's acceptance of the "correct in principle" valuation methods appropriate to each sector was asymmetric. The court accepted as admissible the market valuation procedures (primarily "diminution in market price") used by the commercial fish experts but rejected the nonmarket valuation procedure applied to subsistence uses (a hedonic price model).

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{potential}} contribution {{of data from}} the Advance Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on-board the National <b>Oceanic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administrations</b> (NOAA) polar-orbiting meteorological satellites and data from the High Resolution Radiometer (HRR) on-board the Meteosat geostationary meteorological satellites for predicting the distribution and abundance of the tsetse fly (Diptera: Glossinidae) in Africa. The images were processed to produce a range of monthly land surface temperature, <b>atmospheric</b> moisture <b>and</b> rainfall indices for the period 1988 to 1990. The performance of these indices, derived from several different methods, was tested using meteorological records collected during these years at stations across continental Africa and the most accurate used to form a refined dataset for subsequent analysis. The time-series of these land surface temperature, <b>atmospheric</b> moisture <b>and</b> rainfall indices {{and a range of}} Spectral Vegetation Indices (SVI) were subject to temporal Fourier analysis to parameterise the seasonal variation in these variables. These data, in combination with elevation information from a digital elevation model (DEM) were used to predict the land-cover of Nigeria determined independently by an aerial survey in 1990. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) performed best and so was used in combination with the satellite proxy meteorological and DEM data to predict the distribution and abundance of eight tsetse fly species in Cote d'lvoire and Burkina Faso, West Africa. The results are discussed in relation to the ecology of the different tsetse species. Conclusions are then drawn on the potential of such meteorological satellite data for remote tsetse fly population surveillance and, in the wider context, to the study and control of arthropod vectors of disease. </p...|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} research that predicts the seasonality of malaria in Kenya using {{remotely sensed images}} from satellite sensors. The predictions were made using relationships established between long-term data on paediatric severe malaria admissions and simultaneously collected data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on the National <b>Oceanic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Administrations</b> (NOAA) polar-orbiting meteorological satellites and the High Resolution Radiometer (HRR) on the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites' (EUMETSAT) geostationary Meteosat satellites. The remotely sensed data were processed to provide surrogate information on land surface temperature, reflectance in the middle infra-red, rainfall, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). These variables were then subjected to temporal Fourier processing and the fitted Fourier data were compared with the mean percentage of total annual malaria admissions recorded in each month. The NDVI in the preceding month correlated most significantly and consistently with malaria presentations across the 3 sites (mean adjusted r 2 = 0. 71, range 0. 61 - 0. 79). Regression analyses showed that an NDVI threshold of 0. 35 - 0. 40 was required for more than 5 % of the annual malaria cases to be presented in a given month. These thresholds were then extrapolated spatially with the temporal Fourier-processed NDVI data to define the number of months, in which malaria admissions could be expected across Kenya in an average year, at an 8 x 8 km resolution. The resulting maps were compared with the only existing map (Butler's) of malaria transmission periods for Kenya, compiled from expert opinion. Conclusions are drawn on the appropriateness of remote sensing techniques for compiling national strategies for malaria intervention...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that MODIS data products can be used as inputs into the seagrass productivity model developed by Fong and Harwell (1994). To further explore this use to predict seagrass productivity, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) custom data products, including Sea Surface Temperature, Light Attenuation, and Chlorophyll-a have been created for use as model parameter inputs. Coastal researchers can use these MODIS data products and model results in conjunction with historical and daily assessment of seagrass conditions to assess variables that affect the productivity of the seagrass beds. Current monitoring practices involve manual data collection (typically on a quarterly basis) and the data is often insufficient for evaluating the dynamic events that influence seagrass beds. As part of a NASA-funded research grant, the University of Mississippi, is working with researchers at NASA and Radiance Technologies to develop methods to deliver MODIS derived model output for the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) to coastal and environmental managers. The result of the project will be a data portal that provides access to MODIS data products and model results from the past 5 years, that includes an automated process to incorporate new data as it becomes available.
