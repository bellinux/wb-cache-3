To ascertain if parents {{are familiar with}} current recommendations on pediatric vision screening and to assess {{their knowledge of the}} roles that pediatricians, ophthalmologists <b>and</b> <b>optometrists</b> have in this screening process. Methods. A survey was targeted at parents to determine what the general public understands regarding vision screening. Results. The survey was conducted from January–May 2010. One hundred fifty six persons responded. Over one-third did not know the difference between eye care specialists. Many believed <b>opticians</b> <b>and</b> <b>optometrists</b> receive medical school training. Over forty percent incorrectly identified the recommended visual acuity testing age. A large discrepancy existed regarding who should perform pediatric eye exams. Most agreed a failed screening warranted follow-up, but there was not a uniform opinion as to when to seek care. The majority of respondents understood amblyopia should be treated at least before age ten; although nine percent believed amblyopia could be treated at any age. Discussion. There is a significant lack of understanding of the current screening recommendations, difference between eye care professionals, and the importance of early treatment of amblyopia. Conclusions. Many parents do not understand the potential detrimental consequences of delayed care in the event their child fails a vision screening. 1...|$|R

50|$|The fitting and {{dispensing}} {{of contact}} lenses requires {{the use of}} additional equipment, all with very specific purposes. A keratometer is a diagnostic instrument for measuring the curvature of the anterior surface of the cornea, particularly for assessing the extent and axis of astigmatism. It was invented by the French ophthalmologist Samuel Hankins in 1880. <b>Opticians,</b> like ophthalmologists <b>and</b> <b>optometrists,</b> also use a slit-lamp/bio-microscope to examine the anterior segment, or frontal structures and posterior segment, of the human eye, which includes the eyelid, sclera, conjunctiva, iris, natural crystalline lens, and cornea. The binocular slit-lamp examination provides stereoscopic magnified view of the eye structures in detail, enabling anatomical diagnoses to be made for a variety of eye conditions.|$|R
40|$|A Federal Trade Commission {{survey of}} contact lens wearers {{is used to}} {{estimate}} a multinomial logit-least-squares model of the joint determination of provider choice and quality of care in the contact lens industry. The effect of personal and industry characteristics on a consumer's choice among three types of providers [...] <b>opticians,</b> ophthalmologists, <b>and</b> <b>optometrists</b> [...] is estimated via multinomial logit. The regression model {{of the quality of}} care has two features that distinguish it from previous work in the area. First, it uses an outcome rather than a structural or process measure of quality. Quality is measured as an index of the presence of seven potentially pathological eye conditions caused by poorly fitted lenses. Second, the model controls for possible selection bias that may arise {{from the fact that the}} sample observations on quality are generated by consumers' nonrandom choices of providers. The multinomial logit estimates of provider choice indicate that professional regulations limiting the commercial practices of optometrists shift demand for contact lens services away from optometrists toward ophthalmologists. Further, consumers are more likely to have their lenses fitted by opticians in states that require the licensing of opticians. The regression analysis of variations in quality across provider types shows a strong positive selection bias in the estimate of the quality of care received by consumers of ophthalmologists' services. Failure to control for this selection bias results in an overestimate of the quality of care provided by ophthalmologists...|$|R
40|$|This {{book had}} to be written. Congratulations to British {{dispensing}} optician Timothy Bowden for his dogged determination in researching, writing and essentially self-publishing this hefty tome. How does one tackle the monumental task of tracking the complex history {{of the development of}} the contact lens, from the production of the first human artificial glass eyes by Ludwig Müller-Uri in Germany in 1835 to the sophisticated, high-technology, multi-billion dollar contact lens industry of today? The superficial answer may seem simple: do it chronologically, but it is much more difficult than that. Multiple contemporaneous and seemingly unconnected events often converged to result in ideas that elevated contact lens technology to the next level and many developments revolved around the deliberate and sometimes accidental activities of a long list of enthusiasts, inventors, entrepreneurs, businessmen, technicians, scientists, engineers, polymer scientists, <b>opticians,</b> <b>optometrists</b> <b>and</b> ophthalmologists...|$|R

40|$|Objective. This study {{estimates}} {{the distribution of}} visual health professionals (VHP) in South America, while performing a comparison between {{countries in the region}} and against statistics from Spain and the United States. An analysis of coverage and geographic distribution will reveal accessibility to vision care. Background. The World Health Organization has prioritized the elimination of avoidable blindness by the year 2020 and has targeted human resource development as a strategy. Most government databases in Latin America do not currently track VHP. Methods. Data collection consisted of 152 key informant interviews with identified experts in the public and private sector. The resulting analysis yielded an estimation of the number of professionals and their regional distribution per country by category—optometrists <b>and</b> <b>opticians,</b> ophthalmologists, <b>and</b> other VHP. Results. An estimated 53, 582 visual health professionals (19, 004 ophthalmologists, <b>and</b> 32, 361 <b>opticians,</b> <b>optometrists</b> <b>and</b> other professionals) show an imbalanced geographic distribution that is disproportional to the distribution of the population. Regional coverage density averages 15 per 100, 000. Conclusion. Across all VHP categories, there is lack of adequate eye care human resources. Overall, the gap between the private sector and the public sector leaves many zones without coverage, and, therefore, in a situation of social exclusion in visual health. Grants.

50|$|There {{remains to}} this day stark {{controversy}} over whether non-Irlen-certified Meares-Irlen syndrome and the original Irlen syndrome are the same condition. Irlen syndrome, for example, seems to include a broader array of symptoms, including severe variants of the core condition. Basic testing for scotopic sensitivity was tried by <b>optometrists,</b> <b>opticians,</b> <b>and</b> orthoptists in UK hospitals, <b>and</b> by <b>optometrists</b> <b>and</b> <b>opticians</b> in private practice employing a technique that used the Intuitive Colorimeter, developed under Medical Research Council license. An alternative approach to correct Irlen syndrome was tried by Orthoscopics franchise in the UK, with wide colour coverage and tints manufactured by Hoyato match.
