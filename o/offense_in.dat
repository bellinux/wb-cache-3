5|$|Facing the Hokies {{were the}} Falcons of the United States Air Force Academy, {{who had gone}} 74 during the regular season, {{including}} a 53 record in the Western Athletic Conference. The Falcons were led by first-year head coach Fisher DeBerry and had the No. 1 ranked rushing <b>offense</b> <b>in</b> the country, using their wishbone offense to great effect.|$|E
5|$|In Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, they again faced a {{formidable}} <b>offense</b> <b>in</b> the Arizona Cardinals. The defensive line once again came {{through with a}} great performance, holding the Cardinals to just 33 yards on the ground.|$|E

50|$|In 2011, Chudzinski {{was named}} the Carolina Panthers {{offensive}} coordinator. He {{took one of the}} league's worst <b>offenses</b> <b>in</b> 2010 and transformed it into one of the top 10 <b>offenses</b> <b>in</b> 2011 with rookie quarterback Cam Newton. The Panthers finished seventh overall in the league on <b>offense,</b> fifth <b>in</b> points scored, and set a new franchise record for total yards in a season.|$|R

5|$|Minnesota drove 71 {{yards on}} its first possession, scored the game's first points on a 27-yard field goal by Adam Bailey and led 3–0 after one quarter. After the opening drive, Michigan's defense shut down the Golden Gophers, {{allowing}} only 33 yards of total <b>offense</b> <b>in</b> {{the remainder of the}} game. Minnesota was held to 10 yards of total <b>offense</b> <b>in</b> the entire second half, as Michigan extended its fourth-quarter shutout to 8 games. Michigan also held its opponent without a touchdown for the fifth time in 8 games and shut down Minnesota so effectively that Michigan started four drives in Minnesota territory in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Robinson totaled 455 {{rushing yards}} and 885 yards of total <b>offense</b> <b>in</b> {{the first two}} games of the 2010 season, which led Division I FBS. Through {{the first two weeks of}} the season, Robinson had by himself outgained 87 of the 120 FBS teams in total offense.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} differences <b>in</b> <b>offense</b> patterns and the prevalence {{and importance of}} risk factors for recidivism between Dutch (n = 542), Moroccan (n = 292), Surinamese (n = 133), Turkish (n = 97), and Antillean youth (n = 72). Results showed differences <b>in</b> <b>offense</b> patterns, the prevalence of risk factors, {{and the impact of}} these risk factors on recidivism between the ethnic groups. Public-order offenses were most common in the Dutch group, nonviolent property <b>offenses</b> <b>in</b> the Moroccan and Turkish groups, violent property <b>offenses</b> <b>in</b> the Surinamese group, and both public-order and nonviolent property <b>offenses</b> <b>in</b> the Antillean group. In the case of ethnic majority youth, risk factors in most domains (family, school, friends, use of free time, and mental health) were associated with recidivism, whereas {{only a small number of}} risk factors were associated with recidivism among ethnic minority youth. Interventions aimed at these risk factors may therefore be less effective in reducing recidivism in ethnic minority youth...|$|R
5|$|The Giants {{defeated}} the Chicago Bears 31–3 in the divisional playoff round, {{setting up a}} rematch with the 49ers in San Francisco for the NFC Championship and a Super Bowl berth. As they had in Week 12, the Giants defense held San Francisco's <b>offense</b> <b>in</b> check, limiting San Francisco to one touchdown and two field goals. The 49ers defense also held the Giants' <b>offense</b> <b>in</b> check, limiting the Giants to four Matt Bahr field goals through the midway point of the fourth of quarter. In the game's waning moments Erik Howard caused a Roger Craig fumble, and Lawrence Taylor recovered it. The Giants drove down the field and got into field goal range for Bahr. On the game's last play, Bahr hit a 42–yard field goal to give the Giants the NFC title, 15–13, over the two-time defending Super Bowl champions. Bahr set an NFC Championship Game record with his fifth field goal of the day.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies {{were led}} on defense by All-America safety Frank Loria, who caught three interceptions and {{returned}} three punts for touchdowns {{as a junior}} during the 1966 season. In addition, Virginia Tech defensive end George Foussekis {{was named to the}} Associated Press second-team All-America team, and helped keep the Hurricanes' <b>offense</b> <b>in</b> check for most of the game.|$|E
5|$|With 313 {{yards of}} total <b>offense</b> <b>in</b> the 2011 Gator Bowl, Robinson broke Drew Brees' Big Ten single-season total offense record of 4,189 yards. He fell 116 yards short of Tim Biakabutuka's Michigan school record of 1,818 rushing yards. However, {{he led the}} conference in both total offense and rushing yards per game.|$|E

5|$|After {{enduring}} {{seven months}} of rehabilitation for his injury, Killebrew remained in pain but rebounded to have his best season in 1969. On July 5, Killebrew set a career-high with six RBIs {{in a game against}} the Oakland Athletics. That personal best lasted barely two months: on September 7 he hit a three-run home run and a grand slam for seven RBIs, all in the first two innings, to defeat the Athletics again. Killebrew led the best <b>offense</b> <b>in</b> the league and rookie manager Billy Martin's Twins won the new American League West division as a result.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} aspect {{of all of these}} examples of noise in European keyboard and string music before the 19th century is that they are used as sound effects in programme music. Sounds that would likely cause <b>offense</b> <b>in</b> other musical contexts are made acceptable by their illustrative function. Over time, their evocative effect was weakened as {{at the same time they}} became incorporated more generally into abstract musical contexts.|$|E
5|$|Chappuis played {{professional}} football in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) as a {{quarterback for the}} Brooklyn Dodgers and Chicago Hornets in 1948 and 1949.

In the 15th College All-Star vs. NFL Champion match, the Cardinals scored the biggest victory to date with a 28–0 victory. Among the collegians were Lujack and Chuck Conerly. The professional athletes included Paul Christman and Charley Trippi. Supposedly, the 1947 class had a void at fullback, {{which may have been}} the problem with their <b>offense</b> <b>in</b> the All-Star game shutout.|$|E
5|$|Despite Brown's intentions, Saban {{was used}} {{occasionally}} on the Browns' <b>offense</b> <b>in</b> 1946. He caught a 44-yard pass from quarterback Otto Graham in a September {{game against the}} Buffalo Bisons. He was mainly used as a linebacker, however, and had four interceptions as the Browns won the first AAFC championship. In the offseason, he worked for Browns owner Mickey McBride's Yellow Cab Company; many of his teammates spent the offseason either at college making up for time lost to the war or taking jobs to supplement their football incomes.|$|E
5|$|Favre {{formerly}} held several Southern Miss football records until {{most were}} surpassed by Austin Davis {{by the end}} of the 2011 season. Favre had 15 games over his career where he compiled more than 200 passing yards, making him fourth in school history on the all–time list in that category. Of those 15 games, five were 300-yard games, the most compiled by any of the school's quarterbacks.

Janikowski also handled kickoffs, kicking the ball so hard that 57 of his 83kickoffs were touchbacks. Janikowski was considered to have the potential to be an early selection in the 2000 NFL Draft by several scouts for professional teams.|$|E
