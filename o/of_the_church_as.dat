5|$|In the 12th century {{religious}} hermits started inhabiting {{the caves}} on Mount Carmel, {{and in the}} 13th century they formed a new Catholic monastic order, the Carmelites.

In the 19th century, it was restored as a Carmelite monastery, the Stella Maris Monastery.

5|$|The Renaissance in Scotland {{has been}} seen as {{reaching}} its peak {{in the first half of}} the sixteenth century, between the reigns of James IV and the deposition of Mary Queen of Scots. The loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>as</b> a source of patronage in the 1560s and the court in 1603, changed and limited the further development of Renaissance ideas. In the same period civic humanism began to give way to private devotion and retreat from the world influenced by Stoicism. In art and architecture, Renaissance proportion began to give way to Mannerism and the more exaggerated style of the Baroque from about 1620.|$|E

5|$|As {{viewed by}} the Catholic Church, Baptism {{is the first of}} three sacraments of {{initiation}} as a Christian. It washes away all sins, both original sin and personal actual sins. It makes a person a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church.</b> <b>As</b> a gratuitous gift of God that requires no merit {{on the part of the}} person who is baptised, it is conferred even on children, who, though they have no personal sins, need it on account of original sin. If a new-born child is in a danger of death, anyone—be it a doctor, a nurse, or a parent—may baptise the child. Baptism marks a person permanently and cannot be repeated. The Catholic Church recognises as valid baptisms conferred even by people who are not Catholics or Christians, provided that they intend to baptise ("to do what the Church does when she baptises") and that they use the Trinitarian baptismal formula.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, most of {{the women}} and {{children}} had gathered in the sacristy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church.</b> <b>As</b> Mexican soldiers entered the room, a boy, thought to be the son of defender Anthony Wolf, stood up to rearrange a blanket around his shoulders. Mistaking him for a Texian soldier, the Mexican soldiers bayoneted him. In the confusion, {{at least one of the}} women was lightly wounded. Bowie's family, including Gertrudis Navarro, Juana Navarro Alsbury and her son, were hiding in one of the rooms along the west wall. Navarro opened the door to their room to signal that they meant no harm. A Mexican officer soon arrived and led the women to a spot along one of the walls where they would be relatively safe. All of the women and children were eventually placed under the protection of an officer and escorted out of the Alamo and imprisoned in the home of the Musquiz family.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{evolved from}} plane to spatial geometry, to ruled geometry. These {{constructional}} forms are highly {{suited to the}} use of cheap materials such as brick. Gaudí frequently used brick laid with mortar in successive layers, as in the traditional Catalan vault, using the brick laid flat instead of on its side. This quest for new structural solutions culminated between 1910 and 1920, when he exploited his research and experience in his masterpiece, the Sagrada Família. Gaudí conceived the interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>as</b> if it were a forest, with a set of tree-like columns divided into various branches to support a structure of intertwined hyperboloid vaults. He inclined the columns so they could better resist the perpendicular pressure on their section. He also gave them a double-turn helicoidal shape (right turn and left turn), as in the branches and trunks of trees. This created a structure that is now known as fractal. Together with a modulation of the space that divides it into small, independent and self-supporting modules, it creates a structure that perfectly supports the mechanical traction forces without need for buttresses, as required by the neo-Gothic style. Gaudí thus achieved a rational, structured and perfectly logical solution, creating {{at the same time a}} new architectural style that was original, simple, practical and aesthetic.|$|E
5000|$|In its Letter on Some Aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> Understood <b>as</b> Communion, <b>the</b> Congregation for <b>the</b> Doctrine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Faith {{stressed}} that <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universal <b>church</b> <b>as</b> a communion of churches {{must not be}} presented as meaning that [...] "every particular Church is a subject complete in itself, and that <b>the</b> universal <b>church</b> is <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> a reciprocal recognition on <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> particular Churches".

5|$|Monastic reform {{inspired}} {{change in}} the secular Church. The ideals that it was based upon {{were brought to the}} papacy by Pope Leo IX (pope 1049–1054), and provided the ideology of the clerical independence that led to the Investiture Controversy in the late 11th century. This involved Pope Gregory VII (pope 1073–85) and Emperor Henry IV, who initially clashed over episcopal appointments, a dispute that turned into a battle over the ideas of investiture, clerical marriage, and simony. The emperor saw the protection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>as</b> one of his responsibilities as well as wanting to preserve the right to appoint his own choices as bishops within his lands, but the papacy insisted on the Church's independence from secular lords. These issues remained unresolved after the compromise of 1122 known as the Concordat of Worms. The dispute represents a significant stage {{in the creation of a}} papal monarchy separate from and equal to lay authorities. It also had the permanent consequence of empowering German princes at the expense of the German emperors.|$|E
5|$|Parts of {{the church}} date from the {{beginning}} of the 12th century. Although its plan dates from an earlier period, much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>as</b> it now stands was built between 1292 and 1370, with the south aisle and transept in the Decorated Gothic of the 13th century and the greater part of the building in the late 14th century Perpendicular. The patrons included Simon de Burton, Mayor of Bristol, and William I Canynges, merchant, five times Mayor of Bristol and three times MP. In the 15th century Canynges' grandson, the great merchant William II Canynges, also five times Mayor and three times MP, assumed responsibility for bringing the work of the interior to completion and filling the windows with stained glass. In 1446 much of this work was damaged when the spire was struck by lightning, and fell, causing damage to the interior; however the angle of the falling masonry and the extent of the damage is unclear. Although the spire was to remain damaged for the next 400 years, Canynges continued in his commitment to restore and beautify the church. He took Holy Orders after the death of his wife, and is buried in the church. Other families associated with St Mary Redcliffe include the Penns, the Cabots, the Jays, the Ameryks and the Medes.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Union {{that led}} to the {{formation}} of the Kingdom of Great Britain ensured that there would be a Protestant succession as well as a link between church and state that still remains. The Church of England (Anglican) is legally recognised as the established church, and so retains representation in the Parliament of the United Kingdom through the Lords Spiritual, whilst the British monarch is a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>as</b> well as its Supreme Governor. The Church of England also retains the right to draft legislative measures (related to religious administration) through the General Synod that can then be passed into law by Parliament. The Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales is the second largest Christian church with around five million members, mainly in England. There are also growing Orthodox, Evangelical and Pentecostal churches, with Pentecostal churches in England now third after the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church in terms of church attendance. Other large Christian groups include Methodists and Baptists.|$|E
