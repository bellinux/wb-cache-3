5|$|Andjar {{was one of}} {{the first}} native Indonesian film directors, with Bachtiar Effendi, Soeska, and Inoe Perbatasari.

The film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that Andjar and his fellow journalists, upon joining JIF, brought with them new ideas that helped the company flourish until it closed after the arrival of the Japanese; the company and its subsidiaries released fifteen films in two years.|$|E

An art gallery in Santa Fe, New Mexico opened an exhibit in 1995 dedicated entirely to visual art inspired by the piece.|$|E
5|$|Britten {{had been}} in poor health since {{undergoing}} heart surgery in 1973, and on 4 December 1976 he died. Imogen was unsure that she could maintain a working relationship with Pears alone, and on reaching the age of 70 decided she would retire as artistic director after the 1977 festival. That year she made her final festival appearance as a performer when she stood in for the indisposed conductor André Previn at the Snape Maltings Training Orchestra's inaugural festival concert.

5|$|England {{abruptly}} {{retired in}} 1997 {{and was replaced}} by Jeff Brokamp, who had been principal of the Crest Hills Year-Round School, which had won awards for its all-year curriculum. Brokamp, with no previous arts experience, began to turn the school around. A new emphasis on academics, more Advanced Placement courses and more stringent audition standards that admitted only the most dedicated students led to better test scores and a higher level <b>of</b> <b>artistic</b> talent; Brokamp pushed to expand the school's vocational training programs in photography, stage management, and costume design by 50percent. Applications to audition more than tripled by 2001 and fund-raising rebounded.|$|E

5|$|His socialist {{activism}} monopolised his time, {{forcing him}} to abandon a translation of the Persian Shahnameh. It also led to him seeing far less of Burne-Jones, {{with whom he had}} strong political differences; although once a republican, Burne-Jones had become increasingly conservative, and felt that the DF were exploiting Morris for his talents and influence. While Morris devoted much time to trying to convert his friends to the cause, of Morris' circle <b>of</b> <b>artistic</b> comrades, only Webb and Faulkner fully embraced socialism, while Swinburne expressed his sympathy with it.|$|E

5|$|In May 1919, upon {{receiving}} {{an invitation from}} fellow Jewish artist Marc Chagall, Lissitzky returned to Vitebsk to teach graphic arts, printing, and architecture at the newly formed People's Art School– a school that Chagall created after being appointed Commissioner <b>of</b> <b>Artistic</b> Affairs for Vitebsk in 1918. Lissitzky was engaged in designing and printing propaganda posters; later, he preferred to keep quiet about this period, probably because one of main subjects of these posters was the exile Leon Trotsky. The quantity of these posters is sufficient to regard them as a separate genre in the artist's output.|$|E
