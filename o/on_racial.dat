5|$|Utami {{has also}} noted that the novel is a {{reflection}} of her own restlessness and anxiety. Although little of it directly reflects events in her life, she notes that Saman's loss of religion reflects her own, and the book reflects her belief that a double standard exists regarding virginity in Indonesian culture. Although the novel touches <b>on</b> <b>racial</b> harmony, Utami said that she considers the theme to be undeveloped.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of Dr. Nos release in October 1962, a comic book {{adaptation}} of the screenplay, written by Norman J. Nodel, {{was published in the}} United Kingdom as part of the Classics Illustrated anthology series. It was later reprinted in the United States by DC Comics as part of its Showcase anthology series, in January 1963. This was the first American comic book appearance of James Bond and is noteworthy for being a relatively rare example of a British comic being reprinted in a fairly high-profile American comic. It {{was also one of the}} earliest comics to be censored <b>on</b> <b>racial</b> grounds (some skin tones and dialogue were changed for the American market).|$|E
5|$|Du Bois {{traveled}} to Europe in 1921 {{to attend the}} second Pan-African Congress. The assembled black leaders {{from around the world}} issued the London Resolutions and established a Pan-African Association headquarters in Paris. Under Du Bois's guidance, the resolutions insisted <b>on</b> <b>racial</b> equality, and that Africa be ruled by Africans (not, as in the 1919 congress, with the consent of Africans). Du Bois restated the resolutions of the congress in his Manifesto To the League of Nations, which implored the newly formed League of Nations to address labor issues and to appoint Africans to key posts. The League took little action on the requests.|$|E

5|$|From {{the time}} that European {{settlers}} first arrived in South Africa in 1652, the country was divided <b>on</b> <b>racial</b> lines, in common with similar settlements. In contrast to other European colonies, racial distinction and segregation intensified during the early 20th century, and the various ethnic groups became more sharply defined and divided. Following its general election victory in 1948, the National Party, led by Daniel Malan, formalised this racism under a government policy called apartheid. Under apartheid, different races were kept apart {{in all aspects of}} life. This system was thoroughly enforced during the 1950s; any resistance from non-white races was put down and laws, supposedly to prevent the rise of communism, were passed to prevent political agitation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, federal {{prosecutors}} such as Eugene Reese attempted to prosecute responsible parties under federal laws against debt peonage. But such efforts received little support nationally and {{none in the}} South, which had disenfranchised most blacks to exclude them from the political system. Northern attention was focused on immigration and World War I. The convict lease system finally ended {{with the advent of}} World War II. National and presidential attention was focused <b>on</b> <b>racial</b> issues because of the need for national unity and mobilization of the military.|$|E
5|$|Obama is {{frequently}} {{referred to as}} an exceptional orator. During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses. Former presidential campaign surrogate and Georgetown professor, Michael Eric Dyson, is both critical and sympathetic of President Obama's leadership in race relations, indicating that Obama's speeches and action <b>on</b> <b>racial</b> disparity and justice have been somewhat reactive and reluctant when, especially in the later part of his second term, racial violence demanded immediate presidential action and conversation.|$|E

The curriculum in most subjects, including biology, geography and even arithmetic, was altered to change the focus to race. Military education became the central component of physical education and education in physics was oriented toward subjects with military applications, such as ballistics and aerodynamics. Students were required to watch all films prepared by the school division of the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda.|$|E

5|$|The regime {{promoted}} {{the concept of}} Volksgemeinschaft, a national German ethnic community. The goal was to build a classless society based <b>on</b> <b>racial</b> purity and the perceived need to prepare for warfare, conquest and a struggle against Marxism. The German Labour Front founded the Kraft durch Freude (KdF; Strength Through Joy) organisation in 1933. In addition to taking control {{of tens of thousands}} of previously privately run recreational clubs, it offered highly regimented holidays and entertainment such as cruises, vacation destinations and concerts.|$|E
5|$|Though widely {{respected}} in her later years, Roosevelt was a controversial First Lady {{at the time}} for her outspokenness, particularly her stance <b>on</b> <b>racial</b> issues. She was the first presidential spouse to hold regular press conferences, write a daily newspaper column, write a monthly magazine column, host a weekly radio show, and speak at a national party convention. On a few occasions, she publicly disagreed with her husband's policies. She launched an experimental community at Arthurdale, West Virginia, {{for the families of}} unemployed miners, later widely regarded as a failure. She advocated for expanded roles for women in the workplace, the civil rights of African Americans and Asian Americans, and the rights of World War II refugees.|$|E

5|$|A Cape Coloured of Indian and Portuguese ancestry, D'Oliveira left South Africa {{primarily}} because the era's apartheid legislation seriously restricted his career prospects <b>on</b> <b>racial</b> grounds and barred {{him from the}} all-white Test team. He qualified for Worcestershire County Cricket Club through residency in 1964 and first played for England two years later. The consequences of D'Oliveira's possible inclusion in the 1968–69 MCC tour of South Africa were discussed by English and South African cricketing bodies as early as 1966. Manoeuvring by cricketing and political figures in both countries did little to bring the matter to a head. The MCC's priority was to maintain traditional links with South Africa and have the series go ahead without incident. South Africa's Prime Minister B.J. Vorster sought to appease international opinion by publicly indicating that D'Oliveira's inclusion would be acceptable, but secretly did all he could to prevent it.|$|E
5|$|Abram Lincoln Harris, Jr. (January 17, 1899 – November 6, 1963) was an American economist, academic, {{anthropologist}} and {{a social}} critic {{of blacks in the}} United States. Considered by many as the first African American to achieve prominence in the field of economics, Harris was also known for his heavy influence on black radical and neo-conservative thought in the United States. As an economist, Harris is most famous for his 1931 collaboration with political scientist Sterling Spero to produce a study on African-American labor history titled The Black Worker and his 1936 work The Negro as Capitalist, in which he criticized black businessmen for not promoting interracial trade. He headed the economics department at Howard University from 1936 to 1945 and taught at the University of Chicago from then until his death. As a social critic, Harris took an active radical stance <b>on</b> <b>racial</b> relations by examining historical black involvement in the workplace, and suggested that African Americans needed to take more action in race relations.|$|E
5|$|Douglas-Home {{accepted}} the foreign affairs portfolio in Heath's shadow cabinet. Many expected {{this to be}} a short-lived appointment, a prelude to Douglas-Home's retirement from politics. It came at a difficult time in British foreign relations: events in the self-governing colony of Rhodesia (formerly Southern Rhodesia), which had been drifting towards crisis for some years, finally erupted into open rebellion against British sovereignty. The predominantly white minority government there opposed an immediate transfer to black majority rule before the colony had achieved sovereign statehood, and in November 1965 it unilaterally declared independence. Douglas-Home won the approval of left-wing Labour MPs such as Wedgwood Benn for his unwavering opposition to the rebel government, and for ignoring those on {{the right wing of the}} Conservative party who sympathised with the rebels <b>on</b> <b>racial</b> grounds.|$|E
