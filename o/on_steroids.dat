5|$|The use of bone {{building}} drugs, like bisphosphonates and anti-RANKL drugs {{require special}} consideration with implants, {{because they have}} been associated with a disorder called Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). The drugs change bone turnover, which is thought to put people at risk for death of bone when having minor oral surgery. At routine doses (for example, those used to treat routine osteoporosis) the effects of the drugs linger for months or years but the risk appears to be very low. Because of this duality, uncertainty exists in the dental community about how to best manage the risk of BRONJ when placing implants. A 2009 position paper by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, discussed that the risk of BRONJ from low dose oral therapy (or slow release injectable) as between 0.01 and 0.06 percent for any procedure done on the jaws (implant, extraction, etc.). The risk is higher with intravenous therapy, procedures on the lower jaw, people with other medical issues, those <b>on</b> <b>steroids,</b> those on more potent bisphosphonates and people who have taken the drug for more than three years. The position paper recommends against placing implants in people who are taking high dose or high frequency intravenous therapy for cancer care. Otherwise, implants can generally be placed and the use of bisphosphonates does not appear to affect implant survival.|$|E

25|$|Neurosarcoidosis, once confirmed, is {{generally}} treated with glucocorticoids such as prednisolone. If this is effective, the dose may gradually be reduced (although many patients need to remain <b>on</b> <b>steroids</b> long-term, frequently leading to side-effects {{such as diabetes}} or osteoporosis). Methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, cyclophosphamide, pentoxifylline, thalidomide and infliximab {{have been reported to}} be effective in small studies. In patients unresponsive to medical treatment, radiotherapy may be required. If the granulomatous tissue causes obstruction or mass effect, neurosurgical intervention is sometimes necessary. Seizures can be prevented with anticonvulsants, and psychiatric phenomena may be treated with medication usually employed in these situations.|$|E

The song climbs higher and higher, chorus by chorus, until Beyoncé reaches her apex, delivering some of her best vocals on the album.

Although she has garnered massive amounts of acclaim through her storied career, Beyoncé is far from satisfied." ...|$|E
500|$|The Daddies are {{generally}} labeled as swing and/or ska band by the media, and their music is largely composed of various interpretations of both genres, ranging from traditional jazz and big band-influenced forms to modernized pop and rock fusions.

The Pacific Northwest Inlander wrote of this style in 1994, [...] "atop the swing of the band's jazz you can hear strains of Parliament-Funkadelic, crumbs of barrelhouse rhythm and blues, snippets of ska, and huge whiffs of in-your-face punk rock", likening the Daddies to [...] "Cab Calloway-meets-Johnny Rotten, or the Duke Ellington Orchestra pumped up <b>on</b> <b>steroids</b> and caffeine".|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Repeat {{fractures}} after percutaneous vertebroplasty {{can be seen}} {{in patients}} with osteoporotic compression fractures. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify charac-teristics of patients with new fractures after vertebroplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-five consecutive patients were treated with vertebroplasty for painful osteoporotic compression fractures at our institution. The charts and radiographic studies of all patients were retrospectively reviewed. Special attention was paid to patient age and sex, imaging studies, long-term use of steroid medication, and treatment for osteoporosis. We used logistic regression analysis and the Fisher exact test for statistical evaluation. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were treated with vertebroplasty at one time and did not develop new fractures, whereas 20 patients returned with new fractures. Sixteen of 55 patients had been <b>on</b> <b>steroid</b> medication. The incidence of subsequent vertebral compression fractures after vertebroplasty in patients <b>on</b> long-term <b>steroid</b> therapy was 69 % (11 / 16), compared with 23 % (9 / 39) in those with primary osteoporosis (ie, those who were not <b>on</b> <b>steroid</b> therapy).

In his book Sex, Lies and Headlocks, ESPN writer Shaun Assael stated that Canadian chemist Mauro Di Pasquale, who had been hired in June to monitor the WWF's new drug testing program and was known for being tough towards anyone who failed a drug test, nailed Warrior for steroid use in September {{and was able to}} successfully persuade McMahon, who was under federal scrutiny at the time for allegations of illegally supplying steroids to some of his wrestlers, to release Warrior from the company. However, in the Warrior: The Ultimate Legend documentary Vince McMahon claims that it was Warrior's experimenting with growth hormone which led to his departure; Warrior was suspended and, in return, skipped dates as he took offense to McMahon's actions.
