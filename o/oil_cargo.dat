5|$|Around 1:00am (evidence on {{the precise}} time conflicts) on Monday, 8 January, a {{rumbling}} or cracking noise was {{heard from the}} vessel, followed shortly by a huge explosion within its hull. The force of the explosion was seen to blow men from the jetty into the sea. Local residents reported seeing Betelgeuse engulfed in a ball of fire a few moments later. A series of further explosions followed, breaking the vessel in half. Much of the <b>oil</b> <b>cargo</b> still on board ignited and this generated temperatures estimated to exceed 1,000°C. The concrete unloading jetty crumbled and firefighters, arriving on the scene from several neighbouring towns, were unable to get near the vessel. The firefighters concentrated their efforts on preventing the fire from spreading to the tanks of the storage farm and on containing the oil spillage. Local families living on the island fled for their lives.|$|E

Estonia is getting much business from traffic between Europe and Russia, especially <b>oil</b> <b>cargo</b> through Estonian ports.

In spite of this, rescue workers were not able to approach the wreck (the bow of which was still above water) for two weeks due to clouds of toxic and flammable gas surrounding it. After two weeks, it was possible to start recovering bodies from the wreck and pumping off the remainder of the <b>oil</b> <b>cargo</b> that was still on board.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 17 March 2014, a team of United States Navy SEALs team {{operating}} from the USS Roosevelt successfully retook the hijacked North Korean-flagged oil tanker Morning Glory from Libyan terrorists while steaming in international waters off the southeast coast of Cyprus. [...] The Morning Glory had been seized [...] "earlier in the month" [...] by an armed group in the Libyan port of As-Sidra. [...] The hijackers unsuccessfully attempted to sell the ship's <b>oil</b> <b>cargo</b> illegally on the black market, with the earnings going to their separatist group and not the Libyan interim central government's National Oil Corporation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design was}} {{patented}} and Doxford's first ship, Turret, was notable {{due to its}} abnormally long and wide hatches in the turret and self-trimming due to the rounded shape in the upper hold and lower turret and thus ideal for grain. Turret was designed for tonnage of [...] at a load line draft of [...] at [...] With engines aft the design was seen as ideal for the bulk oil trade meeting the latest Suez Canal regulations in which coal bunkers would be separated from <b>oil</b> <b>cargo</b> by a double bulkhead filled with water. It was noted that the vessel had an unusually high righting angle which was obtained whether full or lightly loaded. In particular the design {{was seen as a}} solution to the problem of strength and economical cost. On well deck ships the lack of a continuous line of the deck, one the turret ship design solved with a continuous line and solid structure up to the top of the turret, resulted in weakness with classification societies taking notice by requiring increased strengthening in construction. The long, wide hatches were seen as making the design especially suitable for carrying heavy or bulky machinery. That feature later resulted in cargoes such as [...] long, [...] wide girders and a 110-ton gun being easily loaded.|$|E

50|$|Næss {{was always}} searching for {{increased}} efficiency, {{and the long}} voyages ballasted for tankers posed an intriguing problem. In the mid of the 1950s he started {{to think about a}} combination ship that could carry both <b>oil</b> and bulk <b>cargoes.</b> <b>Oil</b> and ore ships had been in operation since the 1920s, but a vessel with the capability of carrying both <b>oil</b> and bulk <b>cargoes</b> seemed impossible to construct. Næss pushed his chief naval architect T. M. Karlsen to keep researching the combined vessel, also checking in on various failed projects like the Mando Theodoracopulos. One of the deficiencies of that vessel was the small hatches, too small for efficient discharging.|$|R

50|$|At dawn on May 31, 1973, {{the fires}} from the <b>oil</b> <b>cargo</b> {{on board the}} Esso Brussels were mostly under control, aided by her sound {{construction}} which prevented the oil in her undamaged tanks from leaking out or catching fire. Sea Witch was in much worse condition, as almost all the on-deck containers were still burning. The US Coast Guard and FDNY agreed to have tugs separate the vessels to avoid {{the risk of the}} rest of the oil aboard the Esso Brussels catching fire. Once separated, the four FDNY fireboats easily extinguished what little oil continued to burn and the hulk of the Esso Brussels was towed to the Military Ocean Terminal at Bayonne to have the balance of her <b>oil</b> <b>cargo</b> removed onto barges for delivery.|$|E

40|$|Novel {{movement}} {{data are}} used to chart worldwide mineral oil product shipments by Handysize (15, 000 – 59, 999 dwt) and larger (60, 000 + dwt) tankers. The data are from 2004 which allows comparisons with earlier studies about crude oil shipments. Theory about ship movements and attached freight rates (RP Rule) gets indirect support. Non-existence of global data below the Handysize enforces the use of fragmentary data from a refinery company and a world-class port. Both data sets {{are believed to be}} representative for the purposes used. Exportshipments of the refinery company reveal a linear non-logarithmic distance function for vessel classes in the 2, 000 – 67, 000 dwt range.
