5|$|However, most of {{the rocks}} have <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> common; the rocks are {{generally}} hard and erosion-resistant. The Rocky Mountain Trench {{is thought to be}} a partial graben, or a long narrow strip of land that has dropped in elevation over time because of parallel faults on both sides. Faults in the Kootenay River watershed trend north-northwest to south-southeast as is common in much of British Columbia. The underlying rock is generally stable and contains more outcroppings of metamorphic and igneous rock as one progresses westwards. Formations of Cambrian and Devonian rock also appear in small amounts in the U.S. portion of the Kootenay.|$|E

The initial idea of what is today known as the Belgrade Inner City Semi-Ring Road, to which the bridge is an important part, were created at that time. This road was part of several plans under different names such as the Main Ring Road, Transverse Road, Eastern Tangent Road, each with slightly different routes. All the plans had <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> common: the Ada Ciganlija Bridge. In early plans the bridge was placed closer to the Lake while the final project placed the bridge on the very tip of the island due to ecological concerns over the lake.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} of the MAUD Committee at Birmingham was led by Peierls. He was assisted by Haworth, Johnson and, from 28 May 1941, Klaus Fuchs. Haworth led the chemists in studying the properties of uranium hexafluoride. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> its favour was that fluorine has only one isotope, so any difference in weight between two molecules is solely due to the different isotope of uranium. Otherwise, {{it was far from}} ideal. It solidified at , was corrosive, and reacted with many substances, including water. It was therefore difficult and dangerous to handle. However, a search by the chemists at Birmingham failed to uncover another gaseous compound of uranium. Lindemann used his influence with Lord Melchett to get ICI to produce uranium hexafluoride on an industrial scale. It also explored methods of producing pure uranium metal.|$|E

[...] Bump had a reputation as being a fair, honest and well-liked administrator." [...] Elliott told Fry that he would be the last football coach Bump ever hired. [...] Fry was puzzled and asked Elliott what he meant. [...] Elliott said, [...] "Simple, I don’t think they’ll {{give me a chance to}} hire another coach, so if you don’t make it, neither will I."

I wanted to... attack that idea that in life you're going up or you're going down... So to a degree a child beauty pageant is the epitome of the ultimate stupid meaningless competition people put themselves through." [...] Co-director Jonathan Dayton also commented on the importance of the pageant to the film: [...] "As far as the pageant goes, it was very important to us that the film not be about pageants. It's about being out of place, it's about not knowing where you're going to end up..." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{describing}} {{the efforts of}} the Romney Literary Society, historian Hu Maxwell, in his History of Hampshire County, West Virginia From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present (1897), stated that [...] "the work accomplished by these few energetic citizens of Romney is astonishing." [...] Maxwell further asserted, [...] "No other <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the history of the town has had such lasting results for good." [...] The society left many lasting impacts upon the town of Romney during its existence and beyond, which included the foundation of a library; the academic and financial support and patronage of the Romney Academy, Romney Classical Institute, and the Potomac Seminary; the civic leadership during the Reconstruction Era; and the influence and assistance in securing the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind. According to Maxwell, without {{the efforts of the}} society, the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind could not have been secured for Romney, and would have likely been located elsewhere in the state.|$|E
500|$|Four {{days after}} Kesler's return, Jannik Hansen was {{involved}} in a controversial hit on the Chicago Blackhawks' Marian Hossa. As both players went up for an airborne puck, Hansen struck Hossa {{in the back of the}} head with his forearm and elbow. Hossa then laid on the ice for a few minutes, during which time the training staff examined him before he was able to leave under his own power. Hansen was given a two-minute minor for roughing and Hossa did not return to the game. Opinions of the hit varied with former NHL referee Kerry Fraser, stating that he did not believe that there was any deliberate or malicious intent, and that he would be surprised if Hansen received a suspension for the play. Meanwhile, former Blackhawks analyst Ed Olczyk stated, [...] "there’s no doubt in my mind, once he didn’t play the puck, he had <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> his mind, and that was to put his forearm or elbow in the back of the head of Marian Hossa," [...] and he would be surprised if Hansen was not suspended.

500|$|Gold's {{plan was}} to set a fire at the Mayor's office with Emma there, knowing her {{conscience}} would force her to save Regina and look like a hero. This goes off perfectly, making Emma the town favorite going into the debate. When she finds out that Gold did this, Emma realizes Henry might be right about evil not playing by the rules. At the debate, Sidney explains what would make him the best sheriff following Regina's script to the letter. Emma reveals {{to the public that}} Gold set the fire, demonstrating her own honesty and integrity as well as Gold's ruthlessness. Later that evening at Granny's Cafe, Emma consoles herself with liquor when Henry walks in with the walkie talkies, saying that he was proud of her and they might continue [...] "Operation Cobra."

In standing up to him, Emma became even more compelling to the townsfolk than when she rescued Regina. Now that Emma is Sheriff, Gold expects to be paid back for his favors.|$|E
