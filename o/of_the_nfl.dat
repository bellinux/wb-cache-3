5|$|As the Browns {{climbed to}} the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL,</b> {{speculation}} began to mount that Brown might return to the Buckeyes.

He interviewed with the university's athletic board on January 27, 1951, but the board unanimously rejected Brown in favor of Woody Hayes, who was unanimously endorsed by the board of trustees.|$|E

5|$|As {{the issue}} of his college {{eligibility}} was playing out, Gambino was being courted by several professional football teams.

5|$|By 1943, 40% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> rosters {{had been}} {{drafted into the}} United States Armed Forces for World War II.
