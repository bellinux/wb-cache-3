5|$|Another 27 issues <b>of</b> <b>Amazing</b> Stories Quarterly {{appeared}} from Ziff-Davis from 1940 to 1943, {{and also from}} 1949 to 1951, but these were not original magazines, only rebound issues <b>of</b> <b>Amazing</b> Stories.|$|E
5|$|Although {{science fiction}} (sf) had been {{published}} before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 <b>of</b> <b>Amazing</b> Stories, a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback. By {{the end of the}} 1930s the field was undergoing its first boom. Gernsback lost control <b>of</b> <b>Amazing</b> Stories in 1929; it was sold to Teck Publications, and then in 1938 it was acquired by Ziff-Davis. The following year Ziff-Davis launched Fantastic Adventures as a companion to Amazing; the first issue was dated May 1939, and the editor <b>of</b> <b>Amazing,</b> Ray Palmer, took on responsibility for the new magazine as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} comics are {{sought after}} by collectors {{due to their}} historical provenance. A near-mint copy <b>of</b> <b>Amazing</b> Fantasy #15, the first appearance of Spider-Man, sold for $1.1 million to an unnamed collector on March 7, 2011.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} CEO of Foundation 9 was Jon Goldman, {{who came}} from Backbone, and founder of ImaginEngine. Upon the acquisition <b>of</b> <b>Amaze,</b> he was joined by COO David Mann, a co-founder <b>of</b> <b>Amaze,</b> who, on January 16, 2008, assumed the position of President. As of March 17, 2008, James North-Hearn, one of Sumo Digital's founders, has assumed the CEO position.|$|R
5|$|The sermon preached by Newton was his last, {{of those}} that William Cowper heard in Olney, since Cowper's mental {{instability}} returned shortly thereafter. Steve Turner, author <b>of</b> <b>Amazing</b> Grace: The Story of America's Most Beloved Song, suggests Newton may have had his friend in mind, employing the themes of assurance and deliverance from despair for Cowper's benefit.|$|E
5|$|Historian James Gunn's {{assessment}} <b>of</b> <b>Amazing</b> in the 1980s is that Mavor, Scithers and Price, who {{between them}} edited Amazing for a decade, {{were unable to}} sustain the standards established by Ted White in the 1970s. Brian Stableford, by contrast, comments that both Scithers and Price made efforts to publish good material, and that the packaging, from 1991 onwards, was perhaps the best presented of any science fiction magazine.|$|E
5|$|In August 1931, Amazing was {{acquired}} by Teck Publications, a subsidiary of Bernarr Macfadden's Macfadden Publications. Macfadden's deep pockets helped insulate Amazing from the financial strain caused by the Great Depression. The schedule <b>of</b> <b>Amazing</b> Stories Quarterly began to slip, but Amazing did not miss {{an issue in the}} early 1930s. However, it became unprofitable to publish over the next few years. Circulation dropped to little more than 25,000 in 1934, and in October 1935 it switched to a bimonthly schedule.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} merger, Bernhard decided to retire, and {{approached}} Edward Ferman, {{the editor of}} Fantasy and Science Fiction, and Joel Davis, at Ziff-Davis, among others, about a possible sale <b>of</b> <b>Amazing.</b> Jonathan Post, of Emerald City Publishing, believed he had concluded a deal with Bernhard, and began to advertise for submissions, but the negotiations failed. Bernhard also approached George H. Scithers, who declined, but put Bernhard in touch with Gary Gygax of TSR. On 27 May 1982 TSR, Inc. acquired the trademarks and copyrights <b>of</b> <b>Amazing</b> Stories. Scithers was taken on by TSR as editor beginning with the November 1982 issue. He was replaced by Patrick Lucien Price in September 1986, and then by Kim Mohan in May 1991. TSR ceased publication <b>of</b> <b>Amazing</b> with the Winter 1995 issue, but in 1997, shortly after they were acquired by Wizards of the Coast, the magazine was relaunched, again with Mohan as editor. This version lasted for only ten issues, though it did include a special celebratory 600th issue in early 2000. The science fiction trade journal Locus commented in an early review that distribution of the magazine seemed to be weak. The title proved unable to survive: the last issue of this version was dated Summer 2000. The title was then acquired by Paizo Publishing, who launched a new monthly version in September 2004. The February 2005 issue was the last printed; a March 2005 issue was released in PDF format, and in March 2006 Paizo {{announced that it would}} no longer publish Amazing. In September 2011, the trademark for Amazing Stories was acquired by Steve Davidson, and online publication began in 2012 with two issues in July and August.|$|E
5|$|The cover art for Amazing {{had been}} largely {{supplied}} by Ed Valigursky during the late fifties, but during the early sixties a much wider variety of artists appeared, including Alex Schomburg, Leo Summers and Ed Emshwiller. Frank Paul, who had painted all the covers {{for the first few}} years <b>of</b> <b>Amazing,</b> contributed a wraparound cover for the April 1961 35th anniversary issue; this was his last cover art for a science fiction magazine.|$|E
5|$|Although {{science fiction}} had been {{published}} in the United States before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 <b>of</b> <b>Amazing</b> Stories, a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback. By the end of the 1930s, the field was undergoing its first boom, but World War II and its attendant paper shortages led to the demise of several titles. By the late 1940s, the market began to recover. From a low of eight active magazines in 1946, the field expanded to 20 in 1950, and a further 22 had commenced publication by 1954. If was launched {{in the middle of this}} second publishing boom.|$|E

5|$|American {{science fiction}} {{magazines}} {{first appeared in}} the 1920s with the appearance <b>of</b> <b>Amazing</b> Stories, a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback. The beginnings of science fiction as a separately marketed genre can be traced to this time, {{and by the end of}} the 1930s the field was undergoing its first boom, but World War II and its attendant paper shortages led to the demise of several titles. By the late 1940s the market began to recover again. From a low of eight active magazines in 1946, the field expanded to 20 in 1950, and a further 22 had commenced publication by 1954. Imagination was launched in the middle of this publishing boom.|$|E
5|$|Bibliographers do {{not always}} agree who should be listed as editor of any given issue <b>of</b> <b>Amazing.</b> For example, Gernsback was in control {{for the first three}} years, but Sloane {{performed}} all the editorial duties related to fiction, and he is sometimes described as the editor. Similarly, later editors were sometimes under the supervision of editorial directors. The table below, and the charts above, generally follow the mastheads in the magazines, with short notes added. More details are given in the publishing history section, above, which focuses on when the editors involved actually obtained control of the magazine contents, instead of when their names appeared on the masthead.|$|E
5|$|Over time Mavor was to {{some extent}} able to reverse the {{negative}} perceptions <b>of</b> <b>Amazing</b> among established authors, but she was initially forced to work primarily with newer writers. Early discoveries of hers include Michael P. Kube-McDowell, John E. Stith and Richard Paul Russo. In a notice published in her first issue, she asked readers for help in assembling news, reviews and fan information, and soon added columns that covered these areas. In 1981 Robert Silverberg {{began a series of}} opinion columns. The artwork was of high quality, including work by Stephen Fabian, and later by David Mattingly.|$|E

5|$|The Palazzo Zacco {{is one of}} {{the more}} notable Baroque {{buildings}} of the city, its Corinthian columns supporting balconies <b>of</b> <b>amazing</b> wrought iron work, while supports of grotesques mock, shock or amuse the passerby. The palazzo was built in the second half of the 18th century by the Baron Melfi di San Antonio. It was later acquired by the Zacco family, after which it is named. The building has two street façades, each with six wide balconies bearing the coat of arms of the Melfi family, a frame of acanthus leaves from which a puttino leans. The balconies, a feature of the palazzo, are notable for the differing corbels which support them, ranging from putti to musicians and grotesques. The focal points of the principal façade are the three central balconies, divided by columns with Corinthian capitals. Here the balconies are supported by images of musicians with grotesque faces.|$|E
5|$|Howard Browne, who {{had been}} on a leave of absence from Ziff-Davis to write fiction, took over as editor and began by {{throwing}} away 300,000 words of inventory that Palmer had acquired before he left. Browne had ambitions of moving Amazing upmarket, and his argument was strengthened by Street & Smith, one of the longest established and most respected publishers, who shut down all of their pulp magazines in the summer of 1949. The pulps were dying, {{largely as a result of}} the success of pocketbooks, and Street & Smith decided to concentrate on their slick magazines. Some pulps struggled on for a few more years, but Browne was able to persuade Ziff and Davis that the future was in the slicks, and they raised his fiction budget from one cent to a ceiling of five cents per word. Browne managed to get promises of new stories from many well-known authors, including Isaac Asimov and Theodore Sturgeon. He produced a dummy issue in April 1950, and planned to launch the new incarnation <b>of</b> <b>Amazing</b> in April 1951, the 25th anniversary of the first issue. However, the economic impact of the Korean War, which broke out in June 1950, led to budget cuts. The plans were cancelled, and Ziff-Davis never revived the idea.|$|E
5|$|Wonder Stories had a {{circulation}} of about 25,000 in 1934, comparable to that <b>of</b> <b>Amazing</b> Stories, which had declined from an early peak of about 100,000. Gernsback considered issuing a reprint magazine in 1934, Wonder Stories Reprint Annual, but it never appeared. That year he experimented with other fiction magazines—Pirate Stories and High Seas Adventures—but neither was successful. Wonder Stories was also failing, and in November 1935 it started publishing bimonthly instead of monthly. Gernsback {{had a reputation for}} paying slowly and was therefore unpopular with many authors; by 1936 he was even failing to pay Laurence Manning, one of his most reliable authors. Staff were sometimes asked to delay cashing their paychecks for weeks at a time. Gernsback felt the blame lay with dealers who were returning magazine covers as unsold copies, and then selling the stripped copies at a reduced rate. To bypass the dealers, he made a plea in the March 1936 issue to his readers, asking them to subscribe, and proposing to distribute Wonder Stories solely by subscription. There was little response, and Gernsback decided to sell. He made a deal with Ned Pines of Beacon Magazines and on 21 February 1936 Wonder Stories was sold.|$|E
