40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} for automated monitoring <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> materials in complex structured. An acoustic source {{is used to}} generate waves in the structure which are then registered by a sensor located on <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> interface. <b>The</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> material on <b>the</b> onset time is used to predict <b>the</b> elastic modulus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> material. <b>The</b> proposed method is based on statistical supervised machine learning. The correlation between the onset time and <b>the</b> elastic properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> material are modelled employing Gaussian processes. The proposed approach is cheap to implement, can automatically clean the noise in the dataset and with small training dataset can produce reliable non-linear probabilistic model for predicting <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> material using <b>the</b> onset time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acoustic waves.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{procedure}} <b>of</b> {{low temperature}} silicon direct bonding (LTSDB) was investigated by bonding surface energy evolving over annealing time. Two kinds of pretreated approaches, O 2 -plasma exposure and warm HN 03 cleaning, were employed. <b>The</b> dynamic analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> surface energy exhibits that <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> procedure {{is divided into}} two phases: (1) rapid reaction between OH groups which leads to a quick enhancement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> strength and (2) slowly further increase of bonding strength and improvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> uniformity thanks to <b>the</b> out-diffusion <b>of</b> interface voids.

5|$|A {{convenient}} {{means of}} determining {{the order of a}} given sigmatropic rearrangement is to number the atoms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> being broken as atom 1, and then count the atoms in each direction from the broken bond to the atoms that form the new σ-bond in the product, numbering consecutively. The numbers that correspond to the atoms forming the new bond are then separated by a comma and placed within brackets to create the sigmatropic reaction order descriptor.|$|E

30|$|Adhesion is {{a process}} during which a {{permanent}} joint <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same or different materials is created. Adhesive is a substance that allows to create such solid joint. Its properties depend on <b>the</b> adhesion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adhesive to <b>the</b> <b>bonded</b> materials, {{as well as on}} <b>the</b> cohesion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adhesive itself [4]. The main factors influencing the efficiency and durability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonded</b> joint are: technological procedure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> application; thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonded</b> joint; climatic influences during hardening; temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonded</b> joint; surface treatment of bonded materials; mechanical, physical and chemical properties of adherends [4, 10].|$|R
5|$|According to {{continuation}} Bond author Raymond Benson, {{there was}} further development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bond</b> character in Thunderball, with glimpses of both {{his sense of}} humour and his own sense of mortality being shown. Felix Leiter had his largest role to date in a Bond story and much of his humour came though, whilst his incapacity, suffered in Live and Let Die, had not led to bitterness or to his being unable to join in with the underwater fight scene {{towards the end of}} the novel.|$|E

5|$|In 1969 {{the novel}} was adapted into the sixth {{film in the}} Eon Productions series. It starred George Lazenby in his only {{appearance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bond</b> role. With the films being produced in a different order to the books, the continuity of storylines was broken and the films altered accordingly. Even so, the character of Blofeld was present in the previous film, You Only Live Twice, and he and Bond had met: this previous meeting was ignored for the plot of On Her Majesty's Secret Service.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe dynamic {{behaviour}} of piezoelectric sensors depends on <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> condition along <b>the</b> interface between the sensors {{and the host}} structure. This paper provides a comprehensive theoretical study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> layer on <b>the</b> coupled electromechanical characteristics of a piezoelectric sensor bonded to an elastic substrate, which is subjected to a high frequency elastic wave. A sensor model with a viscoelastic bonding layer, which undergoes a shear deformation, is proposed to simulate the two dimensional electromechanical behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> integrated system. Analytical solution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problem is provided by using Fourier transform and solving the resulting integral equations in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interfacial stress. Numerical simulation is conducted to study <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> layer upon <b>the</b> dynamic response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sensor under different loading frequencies. The {{results indicate that the}} modulus and <b>the</b> thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> layer have significant effects on sensor response, but <b>the</b> viscosity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> layer is relatively less important...|$|R
5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bond</b> {{novels and}} short stories {{have since been}} adapted for illustration, as well as Kingsley Amis's Colonel Sun; the works were written by Henry Gammidge or Jim Lawrence with Yaroslav Horak {{replacing}} McClusky as artist in 1966. After the Fleming and Amis material had been adapted, original stories were produced, continuing in the Daily Express and Sunday Express until May 1977.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{film in the}} Eon series, Thunderball, was {{the third}} to portray Leiter and the {{producers}} chose a third actor to play the role, Rik Van Nutter. Van Nutter was married to Swedish actress Anita Ekberg {{at the time and}} the couple had dined with Cubby and Dana Broccoli after Ekberg had appeared in the Eon-produced Call Me Bwana. Van Nutter was subsequently offered the Leiter role without an audition, although he did have screen tests with some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bond</b> girls.|$|E
5|$|Undaunted by {{the failure}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> issue, Fields {{returned}} to the 1926 General Assembly with more proposals, including another increase in the gasoline tax to provide the funds needed to construct the state highway system.

5|$|Boyd closely {{based his}} version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bond</b> {{character}} on Ian Fleming's, and eschewed {{any of the}} film versions. The novel is set in 1969—six years after Fleming's last work was set—and Bond is 45 years old. Boyd was raised in Nigeria and used his experiences {{during the civil war}} to provide the location for the novel. He has been a Bond fan since his youth and, in preparation for writing the novel he read all the Bond stories in chronological order. It took 18 months to write the novel, with some friction between Boyd and the Fleming estate over the portrayal of Bond.|$|E
5|$|Casino Royale was {{simultaneously}} {{released on}} DVD, UMD and Blu-ray Disc on 16 March 2007. In the UK, Casino Royale {{was released on}} 16 March 2007 on DVD and Blu-ray Disc.

40|$|The {{physical}} and chemical nature of chemically bonded phases used in high performance liquid chromatography have been studied. These bonded phases were characterized {{by a variety of}} chromotographic and non-chromatographic experiments. The non-chromatographic techniques included ¹³C NMR and batch extraction methods. The role played by <b>the</b> <b>bonded</b> phase as well as the mobile phase in determining <b>the</b> retention characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> "stationary phase" were determined. <b>The</b> retention <b>of</b> solute molecules on bonded phases was found to be a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chain length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonded</b> phase, <b>the</b> chemical nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonded</b> molecule, and <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> organic modifier used in the mobile phase. <b>The</b> energetics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solute-stationary phase interactions was determined by the differential enthalpy and was found to be indicative of a partitioning process between two liquid phases. The retention process was also affected by <b>the</b> surface coverage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonded</b> molecule. Optimum retention and separation characteristics were obtained with a hydrocarbon bonded phase of high surface coverage when used with a mobile phase containing a very polar organic modifier. <b>The</b> efficiency <b>of</b> these <b>bonded</b> phases was found to be independent of chain length as well as surface coverage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonded</b> molecule. Some bonded phases which have specific functionalities incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>bonded</b> molecule are not true reversed phases. <b>The</b> selectivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonded</b> phases towards polar solute molecules was found to be affected by <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> organic modifier used in the mobile phase. <b>The</b> major accomplishment <b>of</b> this work shows that the stationary phase consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonded</b> molecule as well as trapped mobile phase. <b>The</b> composition <b>of</b> this ternary mixture is a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> type and amount <b>of</b> <b>bonded</b> material and <b>the</b> type and amount of organic modifier used in the mobile phase...|$|R
