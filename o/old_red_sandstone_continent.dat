5|$|The {{island is}} {{composed}} {{of a variety of}} volcanic and sedimentary rock formations from the Devonian period. At that time the Scottish landmass formed part of the <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone</b> <b>Continent</b> and lay some 10-25 degrees south of the equator. The accumulations of Old Red Sandstone, laid down from 408 to 370 million years ago, were created as earlier Silurian rocks, uplifted by the formation of Pangaea, eroded and then were deposited into river deltas. The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of the eroding mountains, stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth. The structure of Papa Stour is largely made up of ashes and lavas from volcanic activity associated with this period, including bands of solidified volcanic ash and lava (rhyolite), {{but there is also a}} Devonian fish bed at Lamba Banks.

500|$|The Scottish landmass now formed {{part of the}} <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone</b> <b>Continent</b> and lay some 25 degrees {{south of}} the equator, moving slowly north during this period to 10 degrees south. The accumulations of Old Red Sandstone laid down from 408 to 370 million years ago were created as earlier Silurian rocks, uplifted by the {{formation}} of Pangaea, eroded and were deposited into a body of fresh water (probably a series of large river deltas). A huge freshwater lake - Lake Orcadie - existed {{on the edges of}} the eroding mountains stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth. The formations are extremely thick, up to 11,000 metres in places, and can be subdivided into three categories [...] "Lower", [...] "Middle", and [...] "Upper" [...] from oldest to youngest. As a result, the Old Red Sandstone is an important source of fish fossils and it was the object of intense geological studies in the 19th century. In Scotland these rocks are found predominantly in the Moray Firth basin and Orkney Archipelago, and along the southern margins of the Highland Boundary Fault.|$|E
50|$|The Alpine orogeny is {{considered}} one of the three major phases of orogeny in Europe that define the geology of that continent, along with the Caledonian orogeny that formed the <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone</b> <b>Continent</b> when the continents Baltica and Laurentia collided in the early Paleozoic, and the Hercynian or Variscan orogeny that formed Pangaea when Gondwana and the <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone</b> <b>Continent</b> collided in the middle to late Paleozoic.|$|E

50|$|The Paleo-Tethys Ocean {{began to}} form when back-arc {{spreading}} separated the European Hunic terranes from Gondwana {{in the late}} Ordovician, to begin moving toward Euramerica (also known as the <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone</b> <b>Continent)</b> in the north. In the process, the plate under the Rheic Ocean between Euramerica and the European Hunic terranes subducted and rifts in this plate resulted {{in the formation of}} a small Rhenhercynian Ocean which lasted until Late Carboniferous time.|$|E
50|$|During the Devonian, {{the newly}} formed Scottish {{mountains}} had rivers flowing all over the land. Shropshire was no exception; these new rivers caused thick deposits in the area.

50|$|Euramerica (also {{known as}} Laurussia (not to be {{confused}} with Laurasia), the Old Red Continent or the <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone</b> <b>Continent)</b> was a minor supercontinent created in the Devonian {{as the result of a}} collision between the Laurentian, Baltica, and Avalonia cratons (Caledonian orogeny), 433 million years ago. In the Late Carboniferous, tropical rainforests lay over the equator of Euramerica. A major, abrupt change in vegetation occurred when the climate aridified. The forest fragmented and the lycopsids which dominated these wetlands thinned out, being replaced by opportunistic ferns. There was also a great loss of amphibian diversity and simultaneously the drier climate spurred the diversification of reptiles.|$|E
50|$|Igneous {{intrusions}} outcropping at {{the surface}} in South Shropshire are few and small, but much larger bodies are believed to exist at shallow depths, evidenced by geophysical anomalies and radon-bearing groundwater. Several sills of dolerite intrude the Clee Hills - Brown Clee, Titterstone Clee and Clee Hill itself. These {{are some of the}} highest points in Shropshire, and serve as outcrops for Old Red Sandstone, and also various Coal Measures and limestone. Indeed, Brown Clee is considered {{to be one of the}} best exposures of Old Red Sandstone that exists. South Shropshire was on the border of the <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone</b> <b>continent,</b> explaining why it appears so prominently in the Clee area.|$|E

5000|$|The Kačák Event (...) or Kačák-otomari Event is {{a widely}} {{recognised}} bioevent or {{series of events that}} occurred close {{to the end of the}} Eifelian Age of the Middle Devonian Epoch. It involved a global eustatic rise in sea level. It was named for the Kačák Member of the Srbsko Formation in Bohemia, where it is represented by a black shale interval within a sequence of limestone. In marine environments, this appears as an anoxic event, often forming potential hydrocarbon source rocks such as the Marcellus Shale. Within the <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone</b> <b>continent,</b> it is represented by the Achanarras lake, the deepest and most widespread lake that developed within the Orcadian Basin. The event is associated with significant extinctions, particularly amongst the Ammonoidea.|$|E
50|$|The Carboniferous {{was a time}} {{of great}} change for the area. Shropshire would have been near the equator, and the <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone</b> <b>continent</b> had been eroded away; {{in the early part of}} the era, the county was under a shallow sea. However, tectonic {{activity}} pushed Britain out of the sea. South of Shropshire this effect was felt greatly, though Shropshire was relatively quiet. Mountains to the north were being worn down by rivers, creating enormous deltas that were colonised by plant life. A tropical forest took hold all over Shropshire, with ancient tree ferns and horsetails. Shropshire eventually crossed the equator during this era, and became a part of Pangaea during the Permian; the area would have been very similar to the Sahara Desert, and would have been in the vicinity, around 20° to 30° north of the equator.|$|E

40|$|Palynological {{samples from}} two {{boreholes}} drilled {{in the eastern}} part of Saudi Arabia contain a rich assemblage of cryptospores and trilete spores. They are dated as most probably Lochkovian in age. Intriguingly, the cryptospores are very similar to those from a coeval continental palynomorph assemblage from the <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone</b> <b>Continent,</b> whereas the trilete spores show a strong affinity with miospore assemblages from Western Gondwana. It is suggested that cryptospore-producing plants inhabited confined, damp biotopes and had a wide range of climatic tolerance. On the otherhand, trilete spore-producing plants inhabited a wider variety of biotopes but were more sensitive to climatic variations. The high degree of similarity between Old Red Sandstone and Saudi Arabian cryptospore assemblages favours palaeogeographic reconstructions where there is close proximity between Western Gondwana and Euramerica and/or a land connection between these palaeoplates. Climatic differences between the <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone</b> <b>Continent</b> and the northern part of Western Gondwana can be invoked to explain the variations in the trilete spore assemblages.

40|$|Early Devonian miospore assemblages from 'La Gileppe' (Eastern Belgium) include five {{varieties}} of trilete spore {{belonging to the}} genus Emphanisporites. These five varieties show a continuous variation of their morphological characteristics. The variation in morphological characteristics {{can be related to}} the evolution of morphological features and allows us to define the Emphanisporites micromatus Morphon. A statistical evaluation of this population highlights the interdependence of almost all morphological parameters. This study proves the increase in size of ornamental and structural parameters over several million years. The biometric changes and the progressive replacement of older morphotypes by younger ones indicate that a temporal link exists between these different varieties. Two phylogenetic hypotheses for the E. micromatus Morphon are proposed. This morphological evolution is so far observed only on the Eastern <b>Old</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sandstone</b> <b>Continent</b> and defines a palaeophytogeographic sinuosus-zavallatus Province.
