In a June 2008 interview initiated and arranged by his publicist, he promoted his book Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War.

[...] At the end of the interview, James Edwards said, [...] "Mr. Buchanan, {{thank you so much for}} coming back on <b>our</b> <b>program,</b> <b>for</b> fighting for our people." [...] Previously, in September 2006, Buchanan had made an appearance to promote his book State of Emergency; during this interview, he said that [...] "we are being invaded by people of different cultures" [...] and argued that Americans [...] "cannot survive a bifurcated culture or a heavily Hispanicized culture, tilted towards Mexico...

Complexities in the PK/Aβ relationship for these compounds have been observed and the data require an advanced approach for analysis. We established a semimechanistic PK/PD model that can describe the PK/Aβ data by accounting for Aβ generation and clearance. The modeling characterizes the in vivo PD (i. e., Aβ lowering) properties of compounds and generates insights about the salient biological systems. The learning from the modeling enables us to establish a framework for predicting in vivo Aβ lowering from in vitro parameters...|$|R
