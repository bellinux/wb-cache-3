5|$|When André Breton {{wrote his}} first Surrealist Manifesto in 1924, his {{historical}} precedents as inclusions named only Gustave Moreau, Georges Seurat and Uccello. However, the Surrealist movement soon rediscovered Bosch and Breughel, who quickly became popular among the Surrealist painters. René Magritte and Max Ernst both {{were inspired by}} Bosch's The Garden <b>of</b> <b>Earthly</b> Delights.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde {{reflects}} a more humorous world-view than Boccaccio's poem. Chaucer {{does not have}} his own wounded love to display and therefore allows himself an ironic detachment from events and Criseyde is more sympathetically portrayed. In contrast to Boccaccio's final canto, which returns to the poet's own situation, Chaucer's palinode has Troilus looking down laughing from heaven, finally aware of the meaninglessness <b>of</b> <b>earthly</b> emotions. About {{a third of the}} lines of the Troilus are adapted from the much shorter Il Filostrato, leaving room for a more detailed and characterised narrative.|$|E
5|$|Peter Hitchens, with {{particular}} reference to events which {{occurred in the}} Soviet Union, argues that his brother's verdict on religion is misguided, and that faith in God is both a safeguard against the collapse of civilisation into moral chaos and the best antidote to what he views as the dangerous idea <b>of</b> <b>earthly</b> perfection through utopianism. The Rage Against God received a mostly favourable reception in the media.|$|E

5|$|Religion was an {{important}} part of life for the imperial court. In the Qing dynasty, the Palace <b>of</b> <b>Earthly</b> Harmony became a place of Manchu Shamanist ceremony. At the same time, the native Chinese Taoist religion continued to have {{an important}} role throughout the Ming and Qing dynasties. There were two Taoist shrines, one in the imperial garden and another in the central area of the Inner Court.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} festival held at Badrinath Temple is Mata Murti Ka Mela, which commemorates the descent {{of the river}} Ganges on mother earth. The mother of Badrinath, who {{is believed to have}} divided the river into twelve channels for the welfare <b>of</b> <b>earthly</b> beings, is worshiped during the festival. The place where the river flowed became the holy land of Badrinath.|$|E
5|$|The painting's {{historical}} significance rests {{both on the}} skill behind the design and its merging <b>of</b> <b>earthly</b> and divine realms. By positioning himself in the same space as the Madonna, and showing a painter {{in the act of}} portrayal, Van der Weyden brings to the fore the role of artistic creativity in 15th-century society. The panel became widely influential with near copies by the Master of the Legend of Saint Ursula and Hugo van der Goes.|$|E

5|$|Tetragrammaton {{issued the}} album in a stark {{gatefold}} sleeve, wrapped {{around with a}} segmented illustration from Hieronymus Bosch's painting The Garden <b>of</b> <b>Earthly</b> Delights. The label ran into difficulty {{over the use of}} the Museo del Prado-owned painting, which was incorrectly perceived in the US as being anti-religious, featuring immoral scenes, and was thus rejected or poorly stocked by many record shops. The original painting is in colour although it appeared on the LP in monochrome due to a printing error for the original layout and the band opted to keep it that way. Another section of the same Bosch painting (in colour) had previously been used as an album cover two years before by Pearls Before Swine on their debut One Nation Underground.|$|E
5|$|The Gangadhara {{image is}} highly damaged, {{particularly}} {{the lower half}} of Shiva seen seated with Parvati, who is shown with four arms, two of which are broken. From the crown, a cup with a triple-headed female figure (with broken arms) to depict the three major rivers in Hindu texts. An alternate interpretation of the three bodied goddess in Gangadharamurti panel here and elsewhere is that it represents the regenerative powers of rivers in the form of Mandakini, Suradhani and Bhagavati. In this grotto scene, Shiva is sculpted and bedecked with ornaments, while gods gather to watch the cosmic source <b>of</b> <b>earthly</b> abundance. The gods and goddesses shown are identifiable from the vahana (vehicle) and icons, and they include Brahma (left), Indra (left), Vishnu (right), Saraswati, Indrani, Lakshmi, and others.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Bosch's work enjoyed a popular resurrection. The early surrealists' fascination with dreamscapes, the {{autonomy}} of the imagination, and a free-flowing connection to the unconscious brought about a renewed interest in his work. Bosch's imagery struck a chord with Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí in particular. Both knew his paintings firsthand, having seen The Garden <b>of</b> <b>Earthly</b> Delights in the Museo del Prado, and both regarded him as an art-historical mentor. Miró's The Tilled Field contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work. Dalí's 1929 The Great Masturbator is similar to an image {{on the right side of}} the left panel of Bosch's Garden, composed of rocks, bushes and little animals resembling a face with a prominent nose and long eyelashes.|$|E

5|$|Examining the {{symbolism}} in Bosch's art"the freakish riddles … the irresponsible phantasmagoria of an ecstatic"Fränger concluded that his interpretation applied to Bosch's three altarpieces only: The Garden <b>of</b> <b>Earthly</b> Delights, Temptation of Saint Anthony, and The Haywain Triptych. Fränger distinguished these {{pieces from the}} artist's other works and argued that despite their anti-cleric polemic, they were nevertheless all altarpieces, probably commissioned for the devotional purposes of a mystery cult. While commentators accept Fränger's analysis as astute and broad in scope, they have often questioned his final conclusions. These are regarded by many scholars as hypothesis only, and built on an unstable foundation and {{what can only be}} conjecture. Critics argue that artists during this period painted not for their own pleasure but for commission, while the language and secularization of a post-Renaissance mind-set projected onto Bosch would have been alien to the late-Medieval painter.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{proposed}} that Bosch used the outer panels to establish a Biblical setting for the inner elements of the work, and the exterior image is generally interpreted as set in an earlier time {{than those in the}} interior. As with Bosch's Haywain triptych, the inner centerpiece is flanked by heavenly and hellish imagery. The scenes depicted in the triptych are thought to follow a chronological order: flowing from left-to-right they represent Eden, the garden <b>of</b> <b>earthly</b> delights, and Hell. God appears as the creator of humanity in the left hand wing, while the consequences of humanity's failure to follow his will are shown in the right.However, in contrast to Bosch's two other complete triptychs, The Last Judgment (around 1482) and The Haywain (after 1510), God is absent from the central panel. Instead, this panel shows humanity acting with apparent free will as naked men and women engage in various pleasure-seeking activities. According to some interpretations, the right hand panel is believed to show God's penalties in a hellscape.|$|E
