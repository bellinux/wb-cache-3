Purpose: The aim {{of this article is}} to review of the literature on the peculiarities of the periapical resorptive processes. Conclusion: The absence of a physiological narrowing is challenging to the achievement of satisfactory early and late therapeutic results. It makes probable either the <b>overpressing</b> of necrotic, infected material when preparing the endodontic space or the <b>overpressing</b> of the sealer when sealing the root canal...|$|E
40|$|This study {{determined}} the fracture load of zirconia crowns veneered with four <b>overpressed</b> and four layered ceramics after chewing simulation. The veneered zirconia crowns were cemented {{and subjected to}} chewing cycling. Subsequently, the specimens were loaded at an angle of 45 ° in a Universal Testing Machine to determine the fracture load. One-way ANOVA, followed by a post-hoc Scheffé test, t-test and Weibull statistic were performed. <b>Overpressed</b> crowns showed significantly lower fracture load (543 – 577 N) compared to layered ones (805 – 1067 N). No statistical difference {{was found between the}} fracture loads within the <b>overpressed</b> group. Within the layered groups, LV (1067 N) presented significantly higher results compared to LC (805 N). The mean values of all other groups were not significantly different. Single zirconia crowns veneered with <b>overpressed</b> ceramics exhibited lower fracture load than those of the layered ones after chewing simulation...|$|R

50|$|Carlsen {{played the}} Colle System, an {{innocuous}} opening rarely seen at grandmaster level. He then played recklessly for a win, openly inviting complications. Analysis {{suggested that the}} complicated 19...Qg5 would have been good for Black, however Karjakin refused to oblige, playing instead 19...Bc6. The position was equal, but Carlsen continued {{to play for a}} win. The move 24.bxc4 was criticized by commentators who said that if Carlsen wanted to make this recapture, it should have been done on move 22. Carlsen eventually <b>overpressed</b> with 35.c5?, going down two pawns for almost no compensation. In time trouble, Karjakin returned the blunder with 37...Qd3? (37...Qa4 was winning), allowing Carlsen to win back both pawns. The resulting position was objectively equal but double-edged in practice, with connected outside passed pawns but an exposed king for Karjakin. Once again Carlsen had forced drawing lines at his disposal, but chose to play for a win. Instead, he erred with 51.Qe6? and after 51...h5! 52.h4 a2! he resigned.

60|$|I am {{sometimes}} hoping, {{that we are}} not naturally so bad a people, as we {{have appeared}} for some years past. Faction, in order to support itself, is generally forced to make use of such abominable instruments, that as long as it prevails, the genius of a nation is <b>overpressed,</b> and cannot appear to exert itself: but when that is broke and suppressed, when things return to the old course, mankind will naturally fall to act from principles of reason and religion. The Romans, upon a great victory, or escape from public danger, frequently built a temple in honour of some god, to whose peculiar favour they imputed their success or delivery: and sometimes the general did the like, at his own expense, to acquit himself of some pious vow he had made. How little of any thing resembling this hath been done by us after all our victories! and perhaps for that reason, among others, they have turned to so little account. But what could we expect? We acted all along as if we believed nothing of a God or His providence; and therefore it was consistent to offer up our edifices only to those, whom we looked upon as givers of all victory, in His stead.|$|R

David roars, cries, weeps, faints at heart, fails at the eyes, loseth his moisture, &c., (Psa 38:8-10). Hezekiah mourns like a dove (Isa 38:14). Ephraim bemoans himself (Jer 31:18).

40|$|Introduction: We have {{established}} a cell line ORL- 48 (T) from a surgically resected specimen of an untreated primary human oral squamous cell carcinoma of the mandible. This patient {{did not appear to}} have any oral habits which have been reported to be associated with oral cancer Materials and Method: The in vitro growth characteristics, epithelial origin, in vitro anchorage independency, HPV infection, microsatellite instability status, karyotype and the status of various cell cycle regulators and gatekeepers of the ORL- 48 (T) cell line were investigated. Results: The ORL- 48 (T) cell line is immortal, 3 T 3 - independent and grew as a monolayer with the doubling time of 48 h. Immunohistochemistry staining of cytokeratins confirmed the cell line is of epithelial origin. Soft agar assays demonstrated that ORL- 48 (T) expressed a low degree of anchorage independency (CFE< 6). Karyotyping analysis revealed that ORL- 48 (T) is aneuploidy in which the number of chromosomes varied between 67 and 73. There is consistent trisomies of chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 16 and 18 and homogenously staining region on 4 q suggesting gene amplification in this region. Sequencing of exons 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 of p 53 revealed a mutation resulting in a stop codon. Molecular analysis of p 14 INK 4 a indicates hypermethylation of the p 14 INK 4 a promoter. In contrast to normal human keratinocytes, MDM 2 is <b>overpressed</b> in ORL- 48 (T). Microsatellite analysis of BAT 26 indicated that ORL- 48 (T) is microsatellite stable and this was confirmed by western blots demonstrating the expression of both hMSH 2 and hMLH 1 mismatch repair proteins. Polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that ORL- 48 (T) was not infected with human papillomavirus (HPV). Conclusion: This well characterized cell line will be useful tool in the understanding of the molecular changes associated with oral cancer particularly in cases where no clear aetiological factors are present.

40|$|Loss {{of teeth}} can affect a person’s self-esteem, social life, {{appearance}} and oral function. Reconstruction of a missing tooth has scientifically {{been shown to}} increase self-esteem {{and quality of life}} and to maintain oral function. For many patients a fixed dental prostheses (FDP) is preferred, either tooth- or implant-supported. Improvement and development of all-ceramic materials have made them preferable to other alternatives. However, despite properties of dental ceramics’ well known biocompatibility, good chemical and mechanical, the materials have their weaknesses, such as brittleness and some difficulties with the layering porcelain. Many all-ceramic materials cannot withstand minor flexure; more than 0. 1 - 0. 3 %, will lead to fracture. Oxide-ceramic, specifically yttria stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (Y-TZP) has become the most commonly used all-ceramic material. This material {{has the potential to be}} used for larger restorations. In addition, one of many challenges is to ensure durable zirconia-based restorations in the oral cavity. In the clinical situation, crowns and bridges are supported by a combination of different structures with differing properties, i. e. bone, dentine and enamel. The complexity of the supporting tissues in the oral cavity creates stress patterns in the prosthetic material, which need to be considered when designing a dental restoration. The durability of all-ceramic FDPs is dependent on knowledge of the material and design of the FDPs. In particular the design, shape of the connector and the radius of curvature at the gingival embrasure play a significant role in the load-bearing capacity of FDPs. The overall aim of this thesis is to evaluate design of zirconia-based restorations in relation to achieving increased fracture resistance. Another aim is related to how the choice of material used for supporting tooth analogues in the test set-up and how this influences test results relating to fracture strength of all-ceramic FDPs. Study I evaluates different radii (0. 60 and 0. 90 mm) of curvature in the embrasure of the connector area and different connector dimensions (2 x 2, 3 x 2 and 3 x 3 mm) and their effects on the fracture resistance of 3 -unit all-ceramic FPDs made of Y-TZP. The results show that by increasing the radius of the gingival embrasure from 0. 6 to 0. 9 mm, the fracture strength for a Y-TZP FPD with connector dimension 3 x 3 mm will increase by 20 %. Study II investigated how the choice of material (aluminium, polymer and DuraLay) used for supporting tooth analogues and support complexity influence test results concerning the fracture strength of FDPs made of a brittle material Y-TZP. The outcome of the study demonstrated that Y-TZP FDPs cemented on tooth analogues made of aluminium, with high E-modulus showed a significantly higher load at fracture and a different fracture mode than shown in clinical situations. Study III evaluates how factors as different default settings for connector design of two different CAD/CAM systems and different radii of curvature in the embrasure area of the connector will affect the fracture strength and the fracture mode of 3 -unit, i. e. 4 -unit allceramic FDPs made from Y-TZP and further to investigate how the number of pontics affect the fracture strength of Y-TZP. The results showed that the most crucial factor for the load-bearing capacity is the design of the radius of the gingival embrasures. Increasing the number of pontics from three to four decreases the load-bearing capacity nearly twice. Study IV investigate and compare the fracture strength and fracture mode in 11 groups of the currently most used multilayer all-ceramic systems for Y-TZP FDPs, with respect to the choice of core material, veneering material area, manufacturing technique (split-file, <b>overpress,</b> built-up porcelains and glass-ceramics), design of connectors and radius of curvature of FDP cores. The results show that the design of a framework is a crucial factor for the load bearing capacity of an all-ceramic FDP. The state-of-the-art designs are preferable, since the split-file designed cores call for a cross-sectional connector area, at least 42 % larger, to have the same load bearing capacity as the state-of-the-art designed cores. Analyses of the fracture patterns demonstrated differences between the milled veneers and over-pressed or built-up veneers, where the milled ones showed numerically more veneer cracks whereas the other groups only showed complete connector fractures. All veneering materials/techniques tested were found, with great safety margin to be sufficient for clinical use both anteriorly and posteriorly...|$|R
