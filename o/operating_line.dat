5|$|In general appearance, {{the current}} <b>operating</b> <b>line</b> of SIR looks {{somewhat}} like an outdoor {{line of the}} New York City Subway. Since the 1960s, it has been grade separated from all roads, but it runs more or less at street level for a brief stretch north of Clifton, between the Grasmere and Old Town stations, and from south of the Pleasant Plains station to Tottenville, {{the end of the}} line. It uses NYC Transit-standard 600 V DC third rail power. Its equipment are R44 subway type cars that are specially modified with headlight dimmers, electric windshield defrosters, FRA Compliant cab signals and horns, and FRA regulation 223 required shatterproof glazing, and exterior mounted grab rails near the side doors. The cars were built in early 1973, {{at the tail end of}} the R44 order of subway cars for New York City Transit (the Staten Island R44s being the last cars built by the St. Louis Car Company). Heavy maintenance of the equipment is performed at NYCT's Clifton Shops. Any work that cannot be performed at Clifton requires the cars to be trucked over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to the subway's Coney Island Complex shops in Brooklyn. The right-of-way also includes elevated, embankment and open-cut portions, and a tunnel near St. George.|$|E

50|$|<b>Operating</b> <b>lines,</b> {{also known}} as hand lines or {{purchase}} lines are what the crew uses to manipulate manual fly systems. <b>Operating</b> <b>lines</b> are connected to sandbags (in a hemp system) or {{the top and bottom}} of arbors (in a counterweight system). <b>Operating</b> <b>lines</b> are typically 5/8 in or 3/4 in in diameter.|$|R
50|$|The system's depot is in Urgench. It is {{connected}} with the <b>operating</b> <b>lines</b> by a service line approximately 3 km long. However, there are no switches between the service <b>line</b> and the <b>operating</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Tianjin Metro is {{the rapid}} transit {{system in the}} city of Tianjin, which was the second city (after Beijing) in China to operate a subway system. Opened in 1984, the system now has 5 <b>operating</b> <b>lines</b> and 113 {{stations}} spanning 162.8km. The <b>lines</b> are jointly <b>operated</b> by two rapid transit companies, namely the Tianjin Metro Group Co. Ltd and the Binhai Mass Transit Development Co. Ltd.

50|$|Tension blocks are single-sheave blocks {{located at}} the lower end of the arbor guide track, beneath the arbor. The <b>operating</b> <b>line</b> is reeved through the tension block from the bottom of the arbor through the rope lock. Tension blocks {{typically}} ride vertically along the arbor guide system tracks, instead of being fixed, to allow for variation in the length of the <b>operating</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
50|$|The arbor's {{vertical}} position {{is controlled by}} means of a rope known as the <b>operating</b> <b>line,</b> hand line, or purchase line. The <b>operating</b> <b>line</b> forms a loop by running {{from the bottom of the}} arbor down to and around the tension block, through the rope lock, up and over the head block and back down (alongside the lift lines), where it terminates at the top of the arbor. The head and tension blocks are located above and below the full extent of the arbor's travel (movement), respectively, thereby enabling an operator to pull the <b>operating</b> <b>line</b> up or down to move the arbor. When the arbor is raised via the <b>operating</b> <b>line,</b> the lift lines slacken, which causes the batten to lower under its own weight (and the weight of its load, if any). Conversely, when the arbor is lowered, the lift lines increase in tension, which in turn causes the batten to rise.|$|E

50|$|Rope locks are cam-actuated devices {{through which}} a {{counterweight}} system <b>operating</b> <b>line</b> passes. The adjustable cam, or dog, inside the rope lock constricts and releases the <b>operating</b> <b>line</b> as the flyman lowers and raises a hand lever. Rope locks are mounted in series to the locking rail. A single rope lock can typically secure a static unbalanced load to 50 lb. Rope locks {{are not intended}} to slow a running line.|$|E

50|$|The {{next step}} is to draw the <b>operating</b> <b>line</b> for the {{rectifying}} section (the section above the feed inlet) of the distillation column, (shown in green in Figure 1). Starting at the intersection of the distillate composition line and the x = y line, draw the rectifying <b>operating</b> <b>line</b> at a downward slope (Δy/Δx) of L / (D + L) where L is the molar flow rate of reflux and D is the molar flow rate of the distillate product. For example, in Figure 1, assuming the molar flow rate of the reflux L is 1000 moles per hour and the molar flow rate of the distillate D is 590 moles per hour, then the downward slope of the rectifying <b>operating</b> <b>line</b> is 1000 / (590 + 1000) = 0.63 which means that the y-coordinate of any point on the line decreases 0.63 units for each unit that the x-coordinate decreases.|$|E
