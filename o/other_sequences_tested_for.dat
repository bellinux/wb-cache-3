As networks increase in size and complexity, the frequency of faults increases. At the same time, the tremendous increase in network speed means that the cost per unit time of failures is much greater than in the recent past. Network faults may be difficult to predict or diagnose, and may result in huge costs. Our focus in this paper is on sequential search techniques for fault detection and diagnosis.

The original ET approach focuses on searching for a high coverage of the test object by generating separate inputs for single function calls.
