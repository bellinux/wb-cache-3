5|$|The basic, local <b>organisational</b> <b>unit</b> of Freemasonry is the Lodge. The Lodges {{are usually}} {{supervised}} and governed {{at the regional}} level (usually coterminous with either a state, province, or national border) by a Grand Lodge or Grand Orient. There is no international, worldwide Grand Lodge that supervises all of Freemasonry; each Grand Lodge is independent, {{and they do not}} necessarily recognise each other as being legitimate.|$|E
5|$|The Masonic Lodge is {{the basic}} <b>organisational</b> <b>unit</b> of Freemasonry. The Lodge meets {{regularly}} to conduct the usual formal business of any small organisation (pay bills, organise social and charitable events, elect new members, etc.). In addition to business, the meeting may perform a ceremony to confer a Masonic degree or receive a lecture, which is usually on some aspect of Masonic history or ritual. At {{the conclusion of the}} meeting, the Lodge might adjourn for a formal dinner, or festive board, sometimes involving toasting and song.|$|E

30|$|The {{involvement}} of all <b>organisational</b> <b>units</b> {{is considered to}} be essential to the successful management of many sustainability tasks (Gattiker and Carter 2010). Whereas it is commonly assumed that <b>organisational</b> <b>units</b> such as public relations departments (PR) are involved, other core <b>organisational</b> <b>units</b> such as finance and strategic planning are not frequently associated with sustainability measures. It is therefore questionable whether corporate practice is able to involve all functional units in sustainability measures to a significant degree (Gattiker and Carter 2010).|$|R

25|$|A Boer {{force of}} mostly farmer volunteers, formed up as mounted infantry, armed {{primarily}} with German built Mauser Model 1895 rifles. The effectiveness and superiority of this weapon over the British Lee–Metford and Lee–Enfield Mark I, {{led to the}} development of the Pattern 1913 Enfield, and the upgrading of the Lee–Enfield to the SMLE Mark III, which would be the stock rifle of choice for most British Empire armies in World War I. These highly mobile mounted infantry formed the basis of the Boer Commando, which was the primary <b>organisational</b> <b>unit</b> of the Boers.|$|E
2500|$|A Masonic lodge, often {{termed a}} private lodge or {{constituent}} lodge, {{is the basic}} <b>organisational</b> <b>unit</b> of Freemasonry. It is also commonly, but erroneously, used as a term for a building in which such a unit meets. [...] Every new lodge must be warranted or chartered by a Grand Lodge, but is subject to its direction only in enforcing the published constitution of the jurisdiction. By exception the three surviving lodges that formed the world's first known grand lodge in London (now merged into the United Grand Lodge of England) have the unique privilege to operate as time immemorial, i.e., without such warrant; only one other lodge operates without a warrant [...] the Grand Stewards' Lodge in London, {{although it is not}} also entitled to the [...] "time immemorial" [...] title. [...] A Freemason is generally entitled to visit any Lodge in any jurisdiction (i.e., under any Grand Lodge) in amity with his own. In some jurisdictions this privilege is restricted to Master Masons (that is, Freemasons who have attained the Order's third degree). He is first usually required to check, and certify, the regularity of the relationship of the Lodge [...] and be able to satisfy that Lodge of his regularity of membership. Freemasons gather together as a Lodge to work the three basic Degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellowcraft and Master Mason.|$|E
2500|$|A Presbyterian {{reorganisation}} of the English Church was now {{a leading}} priority, in line with Parliament's promises to its Scottish Covenanter allies in the Civil War. Only eight counties {{got as far as}} attempting to put such a scheme into practice and Shropshire was one of them. The Shropshire scheme is outlined in a document, dated 29 April 1647, and issued over the signature of Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester. Entitled The Severall Divisions and Persons for Classicall Presbyteries in the County of Salop, the scheme envisaged a division of the county or [...] "province" [...] into six areas, each covered by an <b>organisational</b> <b>unit</b> of the Church, termed a classis or classical presbytery. Each classis was given a list of constituent parishes, followed by two lists of personnel: first a list of [...] "Minister fit to bee" [...] of it (corresponding in modern terminology to the teaching elders), and then a list of [...] "Others fit to bee" [...] of it (the ruling or lay elders). Shrewsbury was at the centre of Shropshire's First Classis. As Puritans of the period used the term [...] "saint" [...] either generally to refer to all Christians, or, in a more restricted sense, to Apostles or New Testament figures, the town centre churches were shorn of the honorific title. St Alkmund's became Alkmonds, St Chad's was rendered Cedds. Fisher's church, however, was treated inconsistently, being Saint Maries on first mention, but then simply Maries. Fisher was placed fourth in the list of clergy, below Betton, Paget and Blake, but above the other four ministers, who served rural parishes, including James Smith in Fisher's old home at Upton Magna. The laymen are headed by the mayor of Shrewsbury, Thomas Knight, although it is not stated whether ex officio or in his personal capacity. [...] Other lay elders included Richard Pigot, the headmaster of Shrewsbury School, a number of powerful Shrewsbury merchants, particularly drapers, and gentry from the immediate area, including Fisher's old associate Robert Charlton of Apley. The most powerful figure in the classis, the town and the county was Humphrey Mackworth, as he was the military governor and headed the ruling parliamentary committee, as well as being a member of every other governing committee, an alderman of the town and a JP. He must have been well-known to Fisher, as he was a veteran of the lay opposition to Peter Studley at St Chad's, and, as the town's lawyer, had helped defend its control at St Mary's and St Chad's when threatened by Laud's intervention in its charter renewal.|$|E

I methodically introduce the necessary sources of law and also aim to draw the attention to the controversial provisions of the relevant statutes. The introductory chapter is historical; subsequently, I define the principal signs of and the issues relating to the origination (the trust deed, etc.) and the abolishment of the units.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{social participation}} {{within and across}} <b>organisational</b> <b>units,</b> {{and the role of}} contextual conditions in learning safe medical practices within specialised health care services. The research design is a case study approach within a regional Norwegian hospital. The paper describes positive safety practices within <b>organisational</b> <b>units</b> related to openness and communication, teamwork, non-punitive attitudes, and supervisor/manager expectations and actions. Despite these positive tendencies, issues of underreporting, collegial mechanisms and differences in safety perception and work norms among physicians and nurses are also present. Safety practices across <b>organisational</b> <b>units</b> create unfavourable conditions for learning in the case hospital, based on problems with handoffs and transitions, and lack of collaboration between units and divisions. Taken together with results on contextual conditions such as staffing, work pressure, environmental uncertainty in forms of economic pressure, and challenges related to collaborative climate (physician/nurse) and top management support, the picture becomes a complex web of related issues that contribute to the creation of what in this paper has been called an unsociable fabric for learning...|$|R
