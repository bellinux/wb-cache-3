5|$|The {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> {{season is}} most {{closely related to}} the timing of increases in sea surface temperatures, convective instability, and other thermodynamic factors. Although June marks the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> season, generally little activity occurs during the month with an average of 1 tropical cyclone every 2years. Tropical systems usually form in the Gulf of Mexico or off the east coast of the United States.|$|E

5|$|Numerous homes located {{outside the}} levee system were flooded {{by the storm}} surge, and 85 fishing camps {{on the banks of}} Lake Pontchartrain were destroyed.

In the wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane,</b> the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) opened 67 shelters throughout the state, and covered insurance claims totalling $14,150,532, including from Puerto Rico and Mississippi.
