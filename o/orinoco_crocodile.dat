50|$|As in {{many other}} Venezuelan localities, the release of captive bred <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodiles</b> in the Cojedes river is {{intended}} to reinforce {{in the long term}} the reproductive populations of this species.|$|R
50|$|When water recedes {{in the dry}} season, <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodiles</b> {{retreat to}} burrows they {{excavate}} into the riverbanks. The adult pair mates during the drier period of the year, and usually 14 weeks after mating, the female crocodile will dig a nest and lay about 40 eggs. It is a hole-nester and usually makes the nest on a sand bank. The eggs incubate for around three months. During the night, they hatch and call to their mother which digs {{them out of the}} nest and carries them to the water, which is considerably higher at this point. Young <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodiles</b> are often at risk from predation by American black vultures, tegu lizards, anacondas, caimans, coatis, jaguars, and other carnivores, though these species are sometimes caught and killed by the defending mother crocodile. Females have defended pods of juveniles for over three years, though closer to one year to independence is generally most common. A study of captive <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodiles</b> noted the aggressive behavior of adults while nesting and noted that the normally relatively docile crocodilians could not be approached while they were actively brooding.|$|R
50|$|The swamp {{forests are}} home to species that include <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Crocodylus intermedius), Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), jaguar (Panthera onca), bush dog (Speothos venaticus), giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis), Orinoco goose (Neochen jubata) and harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja).Endangered species include the <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile,</b> giant otter and yellow-bellied {{seedeater}} (Sporophila nigricollis).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile</b> {{is highly}} {{endangered}} due to excessive hunting for its hide. During the 1940s to the 1960s, {{thousands of these}} animals were slaughtered in the Orinoco River and the Llanos wetlands, and the species {{came very close to}} extinction. The <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile</b> was given protected status in the 1970s, but has yet to recover. Today, it is protected both in Colombia and Venezuela, and also included on Appendix I by CITES. In addition to hunting for its hide, more recent threats include the collection of juveniles for sale in the live animal trade, pollution, and the proposal of a dam in the upper Orinoco River region. Another problem is the increased population of spectacled caimans, a smaller crocodilian that can outcompete the <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile</b> for fish due to its much larger population and much more accelerated breeding rates.|$|E

50|$|The fauna of Venezuela {{consists}} of a huge variety of animals. Venezuela's diverse wildlife includes manatees, Amazon river dolphins, and <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodiles,</b> which {{have been reported to}} reach up to 6.6 m in length. Some 23% of reptilian and 50% of amphibian species that inhabit the country are endemic to Venezuela. Overall, around 8,000 species (the world's 5th highest total) are endemic to the country.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper level}} of the {{aquarium}} is an artificial reproduction of the Orinoco Rainforest. The rainforest is an aviary, with birds such as scarlet ibis and toucans flying freely. While winding {{their way through the}} rainforest, visitors see the only public display of three-toed sloths and Antillean manatees in the United States, plus animals such as electric eels, caecilians, tamarins, poison dart frogs, <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodiles,</b> and vampire bats.|$|R
50|$|The {{biology of}} the <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile</b> is poorly {{documented}} in the wild, mostly due its small population. It {{is thought to have}} a more piscivorous diet with an opportunistic nature resulting in a generalist predatory behavior. The <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile</b> is an apex predator and will take the opportunity to prey on a variety of reptiles, birds, and mammals, including caimans on occasion. The prey base is mostly made up of large predatory fish, challenging the general view by the locals complaining about the crocodile hunting local fish to very low numbers. Despite its large size, the <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile</b> rarely poses a threat to humans, despite several reports. Reproduction takes place in the dry season when the water level is lower. Orinoco crocodiles are hole nesters, digging holes in the sand to lay their eggs. The females guard the nests and young up to several years.|$|E
50|$|As {{part of the}} <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile</b> Conservation Program in Venezuela, {{between the}} years 2005 and 2007, have been reintroduced in the Cojedes river, 361 young {{crocodiles}} breed in captivity during at least one year, {{in order to increase}} their survival probabilities.|$|E
5000|$|The boto (also {{called the}} [...] "Amazon river dolphin") {{and the giant}} river otter inhabit the Orinoco River system. The <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile</b> {{is one of the}} rarest {{reptiles}} in the world. Its range in the wild is restricted to the Orinoco River Basin.|$|E
50|$|Animals of Venezuela are {{diverse and}} include manatees, three-toed sloth, two-toed sloth, Amazon river dolphins, and <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodiles,</b> {{which have been}} {{reported}} to reach up to 6.6 m in length. Venezuela hosts a total of 1,417 bird species, 48 of which are endemic. Important birds include ibises, ospreys, kingfishers, and the yellow-orange Venezuelan troupial, the national bird. Notable mammals include the giant anteater, jaguar, and the capybara, the world's largest rodent. More than half of Venezuelan avian and mammalian species are found in the Amazonian forests south of the Orinoco.|$|R
50|$|The Crocodile Zoo (Krokodille Zoo) is a zoo on the Danish {{island of}} Falster. It is located {{just to the}} {{southwest}} of Gundslevmagle, northeast of Eskilstrup, towards the northern centre of the island. Established in 2000, the zoo has the world's largest collection of crocodilians (crocodiles and relatives) with all 23 existing species (same as St. Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park). This includes the only <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodiles</b> outside the Americas, which {{are part of a}} breeding program involving US zoos and the Venezuelan government. Their male Nile crocodile Sobek, at more than 5 m long and 600 kg in weight, is the largest crocodilian in Europe, and Medusa, a 6.3 m reticulated python, is among the largest snakes in Europe.|$|R
50|$|The {{false gharial}} may be {{considered}} an ecological equivalent to Neotropical crocodiles such as the <b>Orinoco</b> and American <b>crocodiles,</b> which both have slender snouts but a broad diet.|$|R
50|$|This river {{maintains}} the main <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Crocodylus intermedius) population in Venezuela and therefore {{of the entire}} world.

50|$|The <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile</b> {{became part}} of Proyecto Vida Silvestre, a program {{launched}} in 2014 to protect 10 wildlife species of Colombia's Llanos. Thanks to that program, between May 2015 and February 2016, 41 orinoco crocodiles were reintroduced at El Tuparro National Natural Park in eastern Colombia.|$|E
50|$|When hatched, {{the young}} are around 5 cm long and dart {{directly}} for the water, but they emerge to the attentions of many predators {{so that only}} about five percent ever reach the adult feeding grounds. Because of this it is an endangered species and is protected in some areas. Arrau turtles are captive bred in facilities, along with other endangered reptiles such as the <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Prior to {{overhunting}} in the 20th century, other crocodilians {{may have}} also approached or exceeded 6.1 m, such sizes being somewhat reliably reported in gharials and <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodiles</b> in very old reports before both species were decimated by hunting and habitat destruction and reported but unverified in black caimans and American crocodiles (although voucher skulls from the latter species show it does likely exceed such lengths in very rare cases). However, the Nile crocodile is the only modern crocodilian besides the saltwater crocodile where specimens over 4.5 m are merely uncommon rather than rare. As a whole, giants are rarer today; before the heavy hunting of the 1940s and 1950s, a larger population base and more extensive wetland habitats meant more giants, as well as possibly diminishing of the genetic lines that fostered enormous sizes. Following {{is a list of}} Nile crocodile specimens reportedly taken since 1900 that exceed 5.5 m, well past the [...] "expected" [...] length for a Nile crocodile. The list includes only crocodiles that have been [...] "measured", thus excluding outsized crocodiles that were merely based on eye-witness accounts. The only exception is [...] "Gustave", a male crocodile mentioned due to his notoriety.|$|R

50|$|The {{stands of}} morichi palm (Mauritia flexosa) are {{important}} sources {{of food for}} many species of primates, rodents and parrots, and are used by many birds for nesting.Threatened species include the giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis), <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Crocodylus intermedius), Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), jaguar (Panthera onca) , bush dog (Speothos venaticus), Orinoco goose (Neochen jubata), and harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja).Endangered birds also include the yellow-bellied seedeater (Sporophila nigricollis).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile</b> {{ranks among}} the largest living reptiles, {{as well as the}} largest {{predator}} in the Americas. Typically, males are 3.6 to 4.8 m in length, weighing 380 to 635 kg, while females are typically 3.0 to 3.3 m in length, weighing 225 to 317 kg. The largest specimen reported was shot in 1800, and allegedly measured at 6.6 m, although the source is considered reliable, unfortunately, no voucher specimen is known from this. Due to extensive hunting for their skins in the 20th century, such giants do not exist today, and modern Orinoco crocodiles have not been reported to exceed 5.1 m in length. Merchán listed the maximum total length attainable for a male as 5.2 m and the maximum length of a female as 3.6 m. According to Guinness Records, the average length of adults {{that they were able to}} examine was only 3 m and the largest specimen found firsthand was 4.2 m. It is arguably the largest crocodilian in the Americas, while American crocodiles and black caimans approach similar dimensions, on average the <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile</b> is slightly longer.|$|E
50|$|The park houses {{many species}} of {{crocodiles}} such as the gharial, the marsh crocodile, the salt water crocodile and the American spectacled caiman. Except the Cuban crocodile, the park has all other six major varieties, namely, Indo-Pacific or the salt water crocodile, swamp crocodile, Nile crocodile of Africa, <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile,</b> Morelet's crocodile and American crocodile. The eight enclaves for crocodiles comprise about 220 individuals, including 125 adult specimens belonging to the six varieties. This includes two pairs of adult fresh water crocodiles. Many of the species also breed here.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile</b> can be {{recognised}} by {{its relatively}} long snout, which is narrower {{than that of}} the somewhat similar-looking American crocodile. This species generally has a pale tan hide, though at least three coloration variations are known, with some almost completely yellowish and some a dark brownish-gray. The skin can change colour over long periods of time; this phenomenon has been recorded in other species that can gradually change the amount of melanin in their skin. These crocodiles have dark-brown markings, which present as more pronounced bands in younger specimens and as scattered markings on mature ones.|$|E
50|$|Jesús A. Rivas (born in Caracas, Venezuela) is a Venezuelan herpetologist, {{tropical}} ecologist, {{and television}} correspondent. His {{research interests include}} natural history, ethology, and conservation. He has been working for several years studying the behavioral ecology and conservation of large tropical reptiles of the llanos of Venezuela. Most of his experience has been with green iguanas and green anacondas, but he has also worked with other reptiles such as the <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile,</b> spectacled caiman, and green sea turtles. His current research is with anacondas. It was the topic of his dissertation at the University of Tennessee {{and it is the}} topic of a forthcoming technical book.|$|E
50|$|The {{spectacled caiman}} (Caiman crocodilus) which may {{grow up to}} a maximum of about 8 ft in length, but are usually {{somewhat}} smaller are to be found throughout both islands in slow moving freshwater (including reservoirs) or brackish water along the coasts. They are shy creatures and pose no real threat to humans unless intentionally provoked or approached while nesting. It is generally considered that the few records of both the American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) as well as the <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Crocodylus intermedius) in the waters and on the coasts of Trinidad and Tobago were, for the most part, waifs from mainland South America.|$|E
50|$|Lowland tapirs are {{excellent}} swimmers and divers, but also move quickly on land, even over rugged, mountainous terrain. They {{have a life}} span of approximately 25 to 30 years. In the wild, their main predators are crocodilians (only the black caiman and <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile,</b> the latter of which is critically endangered, are large enough to take these tapirs, as the American crocodile only exists {{in the northern part}} of South America) and large cats, such as the jaguar and cougar, which often attack tapirs at night when they leave the water and sleep on the riverbank. Brazilian tapirs are also attacked by green anacondas. They are known to run to water when scared to take cover.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Crocodylus intermedius) is a {{critically}} endangered crocodile. Its population {{is very small}} and {{it can only be}} found in freshwater environments in Colombia and Venezuela, in particular the Orinoco River and its tributaries. Extensively hunted for their skins in the 19th and 20th centuries, this species {{is one of the most}} critically endangered species of crocodiles. It is a very large species, in fact the largest species of crocodilian and predator in the Americas. Males have been reported up to 6.6 m in the past, but such sizes do not exist today, 5.2 m being a more widely accepted maximum size. Males average at 4.1 m in length weighing 380 kg, while females are slightly smaller averaging 225 kg. Sexual dimorphism is not as profound as in some other species. The coloration is light even in adults.|$|E
50|$|Other fossil {{species from}} Africa are {{retained}} in Crocodylus {{and appear to}} be {{closely related to the}} Nile crocodile: namely C. checchiai from Miocene in Kenya, C. anthropophagus from Plio-Pleistocene Tanzania, and C. thorbjarnarsoni from Plio-Pleistocene Kenya. While C. checchiai was about {{the same size as the}} larger modern Nile crocodiles, and shared similar physical characteristics to the modern species, C. anthropophagus and thorbjarnarsoni were both somewhat larger, with projected total lengths of up to 7.5 - 7.6 m. Also C. anthropophagus and thorbjarnarsoni as well as Rimasuchus were all relatively broad-snouted as well as large, indicating a specialization at hunting sizeable prey, such as large mammals and freshwater turtles, the latter much larger than any in present-day Africa. It has been theorized that, based on morphology, time and placement of fossils, C. checchiai essentially forms a link between the Nile crocodile and today's Neotropical crocodiles. The Nile crocodile apparently is more closely related to the crocodiles of the Americas, namely the American (Crocodylus acutus), Cuban (Crocodylus rhombifer), Morelet's (Crocodylus moreletii) and <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Crocodylus intermedius), than to the West African crocodile or other extant African crocodilians.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the Orinoco crocodile's diet consists of large fish, their relatively narrow snout being ideally suited to minimize water resistance in capturing prey. However, as an opportunistic apex predator, virtually any animal living within its range {{could be considered a}} potential meal, such as reptiles, birds, and mammals. Despite having a rather elongated skull, its base snout is wide, hinting to a generalist diet. It stalks both aquatic and terrestrial prey. As a large adult, terrestrial prey may include capybara, domestic animals, and even occasionally other large predators if the opportunity arises. Similar to many of the larger crocodile species, the <b>Orinoco</b> <b>crocodile</b> has also been observed catching and eating smaller species of crocodilians, such as caimans and sometimes cannibalizing smaller individuals of its own kind. Attacks on humans have been reported, but this is highly unlikely to be a common behavior, given the extremely small population of the species and its relative isolation from large human settlements. Its large size may pose a threat, but this species has a less aggressive temperament compared to other large crocodiles, which reduces the likelihood of it preying on humans.|$|E
50|$|The {{black caiman}} {{is one of}} the largest extant reptiles. It is the largest {{predator}} in the Amazon basin and possibly the largest member of the family Alligatoridae. Most adult black caimans are 2.8 to(-) 4.26 m in length, with a few old males growing larger than 5 m and exceeding a weight of 400 kg. Sub-adult male specimens of around 2.5 - 3.35 m will weigh roughly 95 - 100 kg, around the same size as a mature female, but will quickly increase in bulk and weight. Mid-sized mature males of 3.5 - 4 m weigh approximately 300 kg. Another sampling of subadult males found them to range in length from 2.1 to 2.8 m, averaging 2.45 m, and that they weighed from 26 to 86 kg, averaging 48 kg. The black caiman broadly overlaps in size with the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), although it is on average larger at maturity. In some areas (such as the Araguaia River) this species is consistently reported at 4 to(-) 5 m in length, much larger than the alligator (which rarely even reaches 4 meters), although specimens this size are uncommon. Several widely reported but unconfirmed (and probably largely anecdotal) sources report that the black caiman can grow to over 6 m in length and weigh up to 1100 kg. In South America, two other crocodilians reportedly reach similar sizes: the American Crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) and the <b>Orinoco</b> <b>Crocodile</b> (C. intermedius).|$|E
