40|$|Included in this {{engineering}} note {{are three}} separate calculation divisions. The first calculations are {{the determination of}} the required thickness of the LN{sub 2 } subcooler flat head according to ASME code. This section includes Appendix A-C. The minimum plate thickness determined was 0. 563 in. The actual thickness chosen in fabrication was a 3 / 4 -inch plate milled to 0. 594 -inch at the bolt circle. Along with the plate thickness, this section calculates the required reinforcement area at the top plate penetrations. It was found that a 1 / 4 -inch fillet weld at each penetration was adequate. The next set of calculations were done to prove that the subcooler internal pressure will always be less than 15 psig and therefore will not be classified as a pressure vessel. The subcooler is always <b>open</b> to a <b>vent</b> <b>pipe.</b> Appendix D calculations show that the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> has a capacity of 1042 lbs/hr if 15 psig is present at the subcooler. It goes on to show that the inlet piping would at that flow rate, see a pressure drop of 104 psig. The maximum supply pressure of the LN{sub 2 } storage dewar is 50 psig. Appendix E addresses required flow rates for steady state, loss of vacuum, or fire conditions. Page E 9 shows a summary which states the maximum pressure would be 1. 50 psig at fire conditions and internal pressure...|$|R
25|$|The {{principal}} {{mechanism of}} ventilation in VIP latrines is {{the action of}} wind blowing {{across the top of}} the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe.</b> The wind creates a strong circulation of air through the superstructure, down through the squat hole, across the pit and up and out of the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe.</b> Unpleasant fecal odors from the pit contents are thus sucked up and exhausted out of <b>vent</b> <b>pipe,</b> leaving the superstructure odor-free. In some cases solar-powered fans are added giving a constant outwards flow from the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Vent</b> <b>pipe</b> of a {{wide variety}} of {{materials}} are used, for example polyvinyl chloride (PVC), unplasticized PVC, bricks, etc. Whatever material is used, durability (including corrosion resistance), availability, cost and ease of construction are important factors. The <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> is sufficiently long such that the roof does not interfere with the action of wind across the top of the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe.</b> For both flat and sloped roofs, the top of the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> should be at least 500 mm higher than highest point of the roof.|$|R
25|$|Flies {{searching for}} an {{egg-laying}} site are attracted by fecal odors coming from the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe,</b> but they are prevented from entering by the flyscreen at the outlet of the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe.</b> Some flies may enter into the pit via the squat hole and lay their eggs there. When new adult flies emerge, they instinctively fly towards light. However, if the latrine is dark inside, the only light they can see {{is at the top}} of the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe.</b> Since the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> is covered by a fly screen at the top, flies will not be able to escape and eventually will die and fall back into the pit.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Ferrite {{stainless}} steel {{has been widely}} used in foreign automobile <b>vent</b> <b>pipe.</b> During the production of domestic automobile <b>vent</b> <b>pipe,</b> because the crystal grains of welding Joint heat-affected zone are not refined by heat treatment and become very big, forming properties of cold machining of ferrite {{stainless steel}} become bad. In order to optimize welding technology, the temperature field of laser welding joint of stainless steel automobile <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> is simulated. The temperature field model of laser welding joint of 409 L stainless steel pipe {{is built based on}} the pair heat source model. At the same time, the affecting factors are considered, such as thermal radiation, phase change latent heat, thermophysical properties of materials with temperature changes and the spread of convective heat in the liquid metal in the model. The temperature field in different welding parameters are simulated. The impact of process parameters on the temperature distribution is acquired. The experimental results can help works, such as accurately understanding laser welding thermal process, predictive control of welding stress and deformation, and improving cold forming quality of automobile <b>vent</b> <b>pipe...</b>|$|R

50|$|Chemical toilets {{are large}} enough for a single occupant, usually about 110 cm square by 210 cm high. While the units are {{typically}} free-standing structures, their stability is augmented {{by the weight of}} the waste tank, which usually contains an empty liquid disinfectant dispenser and deodorizer. Some include both a seated toilet and a urinal. Most include lockable doors, ventilation near the top, and a <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> for the holding tank. When wind is blowing over the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> it creates a low pressure area sucking the odor out. Leaving the toilet lid open will reverse the flow of the venting of the tank.|$|R

50|$|Air {{admittance}} valves (AAVs, or {{commonly referred}} to in the UK as Durgo valves and in the US as Studor vents and Sure-VentÂ®) are negative-pressure-activated, one-way mechanical valves, used in a plumbing or drainage venting system to eliminate the need for conventional <b>pipe</b> <b>venting</b> and roof penetrations. A discharge of wastewater causes the AAV to open, releasing the vacuum and allowing air to enter the plumbing <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> for proper pressure equalization.|$|R

40|$|Field {{failures}} of high temperature (category 111) plastic venting {{systems have been}} reported in the U. S. and Canada. This report presents the preliminary results of studies conducted at Battelle and CGRI, and includes preliminary recommendations for reducing the potential for failure of plastic Category 111 venting systems. Analysis of failed <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> materials indicates that in some installations the pipe and fittings exhibit environmental stress cracking upon exposure to the vent environment and stresses resulting from poor installation practices. The adhesives used to seal the joints also appear to degrade upon exposure to the vent environment in some installations. Degradation of the adhesive may allow the joints to seperate. Tests indicated that RADEL, the material currently used by <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> manufacturers, has a significantly higher resistant to environmental stress cracking than previously used materials when exposed to sulfuric acid, which is present in the vent environment. Also, use of an acid-resistant adhesive with a primer may improve joint durability. Preliminary recommendations include: using the new plastic material for <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> and fittings, reducing the residual stresses in the fabricated parts to 300 psi or less, improving the manufacturers' installation instructions to make them easier to use in the field, and continued testing of acid resistant adhesives/sealants to indentify materials that will remain serviceable for the life of the vent system. ...|$|R

40|$|Cyclones {{which are}} useful to {{separate}} particles from particle-gas mixture by spinning movement of centrifugal forces, are stationary pieced devices, main advantages of Cyclones {{are that they}} are simple and also operate under heavy conditions such as high temperature and high pressure. However, it is the disadvantage that for the particles whose size is less than 5 Âµm, collection efficiency is low. From an engineering point of view, there are two important parameters in Cyclones. They are the cyclone pressure loss and particle collection efficiency. One of them, cyclone pressure loss has got economically importance since cyclone pressure loss effects fan power. Cyclone pressure losses occur in cyclone inlet cross-section, cyclone inner wall, and cyclone <b>vent</b> <b>pipe.</b> In this study, the effect of <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter changing in tangential inlet reverse flow cyclones on pressure drop is investigated experimentally...|$|R
40|$|The Kansas Radon Program {{assisted}} {{the city of}} Manhattan with conducting a survey of homes built with radon-resistant new construction (RRNC) techniques. The project {{was part of an}} EPA initiative to build a database of RRNC homes across the country. Twenty-four homes were initially tested with 13 homes (54 %) exhibiting elevated radon levels (average radon value of 4. 0 pCi 1 L or higher). Seven homes were then tested using the EPA RRNC efficiency testing protocol. The average observed reduction in radon was approximately 3 1 %. Multiple construction errors were noted during physical examination of the homes including 1) either uncovered or unsealed sump pit foundation penetrations, 2) excessive horizontal pipe runs, 3) failure to run the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> through the roof, and 4) placement of the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> in non-conditioned spaces such as garages...|$|R
