50|$|The {{control of}} a turbine with a {{governor}} is essential, as turbines need to be run up slowly to prevent damage and some applications (such as the generation of alternating current electricity) require precise speed control. Uncontrolled acceleration of the turbine rotor can lead to an <b>overspeed</b> <b>trip,</b> which causes the governor and throttle valves that control the flow of steam to the turbine to close. If these valves fail then the turbine may continue accelerating until it breaks apart, often catastrophically. Turbines are expensive to make, requiring precision manufacture and special quality materials.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{managers}} {{in charge of}} every process plant are looking for areas where moderate changes in the process or equipment can yield a return of increased throughput and reliability. The approach employed for the ammonia plant discussed in this case study is to consolidate the diverse controls for major process compressors, steam turbine prime movers, and associated pressure reducing valves. By consolidating all these controls in a single triple modular redundant (TMR) control system, variations in the steam and process headers have been reduced significantly. A separate TMR ESD system was installed {{at the same time}} to reduce the risk of unsafe process operation and provide primary electronic <b>overspeed</b> <b>trip</b> to all the steam turbines...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} {{to examine the relationship}} between time-dependent degradation and current industry practices in the areas of maintenance, surveillance, and operation of steam turbine drives for safety-related pumps. These pumps are located in the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) system for pressurized-water reactor plants and in the Reactor Core Isolation Cooling and High-Pressure Coolant Injection systems for boiling-water reactor plants. This research has been conducted by examination of failure data in the Nuclear Plant Reliability Data System, review of Licensee Event Reports, discussion of problems with operating plant personnel, and personal observation. The reported failure data were reviewed to determine the cause of the event and the method of discovery. Based on the research results, attempts have been made to determine the predictability of failures and possible preventive measures that may be implemented. Findings in a recent study of AFW systems indicate that the turbine drive is the single largest contributor to AFW system degradation. However, examination of the data shows that the turbine itself is a reliable piece of equipment with a good service record. Most of the problems documented are the result of problems with the turbine controls and the mechanical <b>overspeed</b> <b>trip</b> mechanism; these apparently stem from three major causes which are discussed in the text. Recent improvements in maintenance practices and procedures, combined with a stabilization of the design, have led to improved performance resulting in a reliable safety-related component. However, these improvements have not been universally implemented...|$|E
5000|$|On 26 January, Thresher made {{radar contact}} with a small convoy and soon spotted two ships {{steaming}} along beneath the overcast night skies. At 00:11, Thresher fired three bow torpedoes at a 1,266-ton freighter, then bent cleared the area. Her [...] "fish" [...] scored a bullseye, and the quarry disappeared within a minute. A second spread, 35 seconds after the first, claimed a 2,205-ton freighter. A third target made off to the south at high speed, [...] "spraying the ocean with five-inch ammunition". Resuming the approach at 00:20, Thresher doggedly tailed the Japanese ship for four hours before reaching a favorable attack position. Firing her last torpedoes at 04:46, Thresher began to build up speed and had just commenced a turn when one torpedo struck the enemy ship, causing a tremendous explosion. The blast slowed the freighter, but its tremendous concussion stopped Thresher dead in the water. All four main engine <b>overspeed</b> <b>trips</b> were actuated; cork insulation flew; lights broke; clocks stopped; and water poured down the antenna trunk. By the time Thresher regained battle readiness, the enemy {{was too far away}} to encourage further pursuit. Well within the range of shore-based aircraft, Thresher quit the chase. Escorts, alerted to the fact an American submarine was prowling in the vicinity, arrived on the scene and conducted a three-hour-long, futile, depth-charging.|$|R
2500|$|On July 7, 2005, BC Ferries {{concluded}} that a missing cotter pin was to blame. The pin normally retained a nut on a linkage between an engine speed governor and the fuel control {{for one of the}} engines. Without the pin, the nut fell off and the linkage separated, causing the engine, [...] clutches, and propellers to increase in speed until <b>overspeed</b> safety devices <b>tripped</b> and shut down the entire propulsion system. The faulty speed governor had been serviced 17 days before the incident during a $35-million upgrade, and the cotter pin had not been properly replaced at that time.|$|R
40|$|While transiting the Brisbane River to Fisherman Islands, despite {{identifying}} {{and attempting to}} gain {{the attention of the}} yacht and then taking evasive action, contact was made between Valiant III and the yacht. The yacht contacted fenders {{on the side of the}} ship but no other damage or injuries were reported. 25 / 05 / 2015 MA 201500073 15 : 58 UTC+ 8 No Esperance Port Elbe Max IMO No 9171278 Machinery failure During pilotage into Esperance, one of the two running diesel generators <b>tripped</b> (<b>overspeed)</b> causing the second generator to trip and the ship to blackout. The standby and emergency generators started and power and propulsion was restored about two minutes later. The ship had been controlled during the incident by tugs and subsequently berthed without further incident. Note: For the purpose of subsection 49 (2) of the Transport Safety Investigation Act 2003 (TSI Act) any On-Board Recordings (OBR) relating to a matter that the ATSB has decided not to investigate, as identified in this publication, are not to be treated as OBR on and after the date of publication of this weekly summary. Section 48 of the TSI Act contains a definition of an OBR. The voice component of a Voyage Data Recorder normally meets the requirements of an OBR...|$|R
