5|$|In some people, {{the disease}} {{proceeds}} to a critical phase as fever resolves. During this period, there is {{leakage of plasma}} from the blood vessels, typically lasting one to two days. This may result in fluid accumulation {{in the chest and}} abdominal cavity as well as depletion of fluid from the circulation and decreased blood supply to vital organs. There may also be <b>organ</b> <b>dysfunction</b> and severe bleeding, typically from the gastrointestinal tract. Shock (dengue shock syndrome) and hemorrhage (dengue hemorrhagic fever) occur in less than 5% of all cases of dengue, however those who have previously been infected with other serotypes of dengue virus ("secondary infection") are at an increased risk. This critical phase, while rare, occurs relatively more commonly in children and young adults.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} TBI who die do so {{within minutes of}} the injury, due to {{complications}} such as pneumothorax and insufficient airway and to other injuries that occurred at the same time. Most late deaths that occur in TBI are attributed to sepsis or multiple <b>organ</b> <b>dysfunction</b> syndrome (MODS). If the condition is not recognized and treated early, serious complications {{are more likely to}} occur; for example, pneumonia and bronchiectasis may occur as late complications. Years can pass before the condition is recognized. Some TBI are so small {{that they do not have}} significant clinical manifestations; they may never be noticed or diagnosed and may heal without intervention.|$|E
5|$|The {{second phase}} occurs between 24h and 72h {{following}} overdose {{and consists of}} signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in liver cells as they metabolize the paracetamol. The individual may experience right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; International normalized ratio (INR) and the liver transaminases ALT and AST rise to abnormal levels. Acute kidney failure may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either hepatorenal syndrome or multiple <b>organ</b> <b>dysfunction</b> syndrome. In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, {{it has been suggested}} that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.|$|E

500|$|The World Health Organization's 2009 {{classification}} divides {{dengue fever}} into two groups: uncomplicated and severe.

Severe dengue is defined as that associated with severe bleeding, severe <b>organ</b> <b>dysfunction,</b> or severe plasma leakage while all other cases are uncomplicated. The 1997 classification divided dengue into undifferentiated fever, dengue fever, and dengue hemorrhagic fever. Dengue hemorrhagic fever was subdivided further into grades I–IV. Grade I is the presence only of easy bruising or a positive tourniquet test in someone with fever, grade II is the presence of spontaneous bleeding into the skin and elsewhere, grade III is the clinical evidence of shock, and grade IV is shock so severe that blood pressure and pulse cannot be detected. Grades III and IV are referred to as [...] "dengue shock syndrome".|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Acute kidney injury usually {{develops}} in critically ill {{patients in the}} context of multiple <b>organ</b> <b>dysfunctions.</b> OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of changes in associated <b>organ</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> over the first three days of renal replacement therapy on the outcomes of patients with acute kidney injury. METHODS: Over a 19 -month period, we evaluated 260 patients admitted to the intensive care units of three tertiary-care hospitals who required renal replacement therapy for > 48 h. <b>Organ</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> were evaluated by SOFA score (excluding renal points) on the first (D 1) and third (D 3) days of renal replacement therapy. Absolute (A-SOFA) and relative (D-SOFA) changes in SOFA scores were also calculated. RESULTS: Hospital mortality rate was 75 %. <b>Organ</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> worsened (A-SOFA> 0) in 53 %, remained unchanged (A-SOFA= 0) in 17 % and improved (A-SOFA< 0) in 30 % of patients; and mortality was lower in the last group (80 % vs. 84 % vs. 61 %, p= 0. 003). SOFA on D 1 (p< 0. 001), SOFA on D 3 (p< 0. 001), A-SOFA (p= 0. 019) and D-SOFA (p= 0. 016) were higher in non-survivors. However, neither A-SOFA nor D-SOFA discriminated survivors from non-survivors on an individual basis. Adjusting for other covariates (including SOFA on D 1), A-SOFA and D-SOFA were associated with increased mortality, and patients in whom SOFA scores worsened or remained unchanged had poorer outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to baseline values, early changes in SOFA score after the start of renal replacement therapy were associated with hospital mortality. However, no prognostic score should be used as the only parameter to predict individual outcomes...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} whether {{acute respiratory distress}} syndrome (ARDS) complicating bacteremic sepsis independently affects mortality in critically ill patients, we conducted a 3 -year retrospective cohort study in a surgical intensive care unit. We included all consecutive patients with blood culture-positive sepsis and measured <b>organ</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> and mortality. Among 4, 530 admissions, 196 cases of bacteremic sepsis were recorded. ARDS occurred in 31 (16 %) of these patients. The case fatality rate was 58 % in patients with ARDS compared with 31 % in patients without ARDS. Using Cox proportional hazards regression with time-dependent variables, the unadjusted hazard ratio for death was 1. 8 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 0 - 3. 2). After adjusting for comorbid factors that were present {{before the onset of}} sepsis, the hazard ratio was 2. 2 (95 % CI, 1. 2 - 3. 9). After further adjustment was made for nonpulmonary <b>organ</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> and microbiologic factors that were independently associated with mortality, the adjusted hazard ratio for ARDS was 0. 6 (95 % CI, 0. 3 - 1. 2). Among critically ill surgical patients, ARDS complicating bacteremic sepsis remains common, but it is not independently associated with short-term mortality, after adjusting for severity of illness and nonpulmonary <b>organ</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> evolving after the onset of sepsis...|$|R

40|$|HYPOTHESIS: A set of {{clinical}} variables {{available at the}} bedside {{can be used to}} predict outcome in critically ill patients with bloodstream infection (BSI). DESIGN: A 3 -year retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A surgical intensive care unit in Switzerland. PATIENTS: All patients with BSI were potentially eligible. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical variables, <b>organ</b> <b>dysfunctions,</b> and outcome. RESULTS: Among 4530 admissions to the surgical intensive care unit, 224 clinically significant episodes of BSI were recorded (incidence, 4. 9 %), with a 28 -day fatality of 36 %. A total of 110 patients had primary bacteremia, of which 39 (35 %) were catheter related. Although gram-positive organisms were the most frequently isolated pathogens (58 % [159 / 275]), they were associated with lower case-fatality (30 %) than BSI due to gram-negative bacteria (44 %). <b>Organ</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> associated with the highest risk of death were neurologic dysfunction (hazard ratio [HR], 6. 9; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 3. 3 - 14. 5), hepatic dysfunction (HR, 3. 9; 95 % CI, 2. 1 - 7. 4), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (HR, 3. 0; 95 % CI, 1. 5 - 6. 1). By multivariate analysis, 2 independent predictors of mortality were the APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) score at onset of BSI (HR per 1 -point increase, 1. 08; 95 % CI, 1. 04 - 1. 12) and the number of evolving <b>organ</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> (HR, 1. 4; 95 % CI, 1. 2 - 1. 7). Appropriate antimicrobial therapy was associated with improved outcome (HR, 0. 4; 95 % CI, 0. 2 - 0. 6). CONCLUSIONS: Bloodstream infection in critically ill patients is a common and frequently fatal condition. Its outcome can be predicted by the severity of illness at onset of BSI and the number of <b>organ</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> evolving thereafter. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy is an important determinant for survival...|$|R
