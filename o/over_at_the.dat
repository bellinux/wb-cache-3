5|$|Another seventh-place {{finish in}} the 2000–01 season was {{followed}} by two less successful seasons, and they were relegated to the second-tier with a then-record low 19 points in 2003. Former Ireland manager Mick McCarthy took <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> club, and, in 2005, he took Sunderland up as champions {{for the third time}} in less than ten years. However, the club's stay in the top flight was short-live as Sunderland were once again relegated, this time with a new record-low total of 15 points. McCarthy left the club in mid-season, and he was replaced temporarily by former Sunderland player Kevin Ball. The record-low fifteen-point performance was surpassed in the 2007–08 season by Derby County, who finished on eleven points.|$|E
5|$|Browns center Mike Scarry {{left before}} the season to become the head coach at Western Reserve. Frank Gatski took <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{position}} after Scarry's retirement. Don Greenwood, a halfback who featured in the team's first two seasons, retired after sustaining a serious cheekbone injury in 1947 and accepted a job as head football coach at Cuyahoga Falls High School in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. Browns games were televised {{for the first time}} in 1948 on 84 stations across the country. Only away games were shown in northeast Ohio; they were presented by Bob Neal and Stan Gee, who had announced Browns games on WGAR-AM radio in 1946 and 1947.|$|E
5|$|Following the missed field goal, Air Force's offense began {{operations}} at its 24-yard line. Running back Anthony Butler broke free for an 18-yard gain {{on the third}} play of the drive, giving Air Force a first down. Two plays later, however, Harridge threw a pass that was intercepted by Tech linebacker Vegas Robinson. At {{the end of the}} play, Air Force committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty, which allowed the Tech offense to take <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Air Force 15-yard line. Tech needed just two plays to drive the 15 yards and earn a touchdown, its first of the game. With 2:26 remaining in the quarter, Air Force's lead had been cut to 10–7.|$|E

5|$|Illingworth was {{selected}} to make his first-class début for Victoria against Tasmania at Kardinia Park in Geelong in February 1962. His selection had generated controversy since he had twice been no-balled for throwing by two different umpires in Melbourne district cricket in the two seasons prior to his selection. One of the occasions in district cricket, he had been no-balled three times in one <b>over.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time, Tasmania {{were not in the}} Sheffield Shield competition, so it was a one-off match.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Mississippi came {{storming}} back. Following the field goal, Tech head coach Jerry Claiborne ordered an onside kick {{in an effort}} to gain another chance on offense and potentially build an insurmountable lead. Onside kicks, unlike an ordinary free kick, can be recovered by the kicking team—but only after the ball has traveled 10 yards. If the kicking team touches the ball before it has traveled 10 yards, the receiving team takes possession at the place the ball was touched. Unfortunately for Virginia Tech, Simsak's onside kick—though it surprised Ole Miss—did not travel the requisite 10 yards. Mississippi took <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Tech 49-yard line, and many of the Ole Miss players were angered by what they considered to be an insult.|$|E
5|$|It was Hamilton's {{teammate}} {{and defending}} race winner Rosberg who topped the time sheets {{at the second}} session on Friday afternoon, setting a 1:12.385 lap time. He led Hamilton by almost half a second, with the two Ferrari cars of Vettel and Räikkönen about a second adrift. Slight rain saw most drivers head out early, but the conditions never became wet enough to require intermediate tyres. After starting on the medium compound tyres, many drivers switched to the softer compound for race simulations, only for the session to be red flagged shortly after when Fernando Alonso spun at turn four, only to pull <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{side of the road}} with smoke coming from his car some corners later. Valtteri Bottas was sixth fastest, behind Daniel Ricciardo, suffering a spin at turn nine.|$|E

Meanwhile, Veronica's bus drives away without her. Instead, Weevil takes Veronica on his motorcycle before they run across the limo with Duncan, Gia, and the others in it. They tell Veronica that the bus full of students drove off the cliff and into the sea, and they look <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crashed bus.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech {{returned}} the post-touchdown kickoff to its 26-yard line. The Hokie offense picked up short gains on {{first and second}} down before Tech quarterback Erik Chapman threw his second interception of the game, a pass that was tipped {{into the air and}} caught by NC State defender Derrick Taylor. The Wolfpack offense took <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 46-yard line of Virginia Tech. On its first play after the interception, Kramer completed a 19-yard pass to Haywood Jeffires. After a short run, Kramer completed a 13-yard pass to Jeffries for another first down. Deep inside the Tech red zone, it took the Wolfpack two more plays before Kramer connected on a pass to tight end Ralph Britt for a touchdown. NC State now led 2110 with just over four minutes remaining before halftime.|$|E
5|$|After {{turning down}} {{potential}} transfers to West Ham and Torquay, because {{neither he nor}} his wife wanted to live in either place, Irvine decided to sign for Third Division outfit Halifax Town in December 1972. Despite taking a considerable pay cut, he chose Halifax to enable his family to return to live near Burnley. Irvine made a total of 11 first-team appearances for Halifax Town, scoring one goal for the club. He played his last competitive game for the club in the 1–0 win against York City on 13 March 1973, after manager George Mulhall accused Irvine of not trying and not deserving his wage. At the end of the 1972–73 season, the team avoided relegation to the Fourth Division on goal difference. After failing to report for the away game at Walsall on 1May 1973, to play in a testimonial match for Burnley defender John Angus, he was fined two weeks' wages and forced into extra training sessions. In the summer of 1973, Irvine left Halifax Town by mutual consent, his professional football career <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of 29. Despite having the option to sign for Rochdale, he joined semi-professional side Great Harwood, who played in the Northern Premier League. At Great Harwood, he played alongside two former Burnley teammates; goalkeeper Adam Blacklaw and midfielder Les Latcham. Irvine remained at the club for a number of months, before leaving midway through the 1973–74 season and retiring from football altogether.|$|E

5|$|Cincinnati's offense took <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> spot of the {{interception}} {{and immediately}} began {{moving down the}} field. Pike completed three consecutive passes: a five-yard pass to Gilyard, a 10-yard throw to Goodman, then a 31-yard toss to Gilyard. After the long throw, Cincinnati had a first down at the Virginia Tech 26-yard line. The Bearcats continued their drive after an incomplete pass by Pike with an 18-yard completion to Goebel that gave the Bearcats a first down at the Virginia Tech eight-yard line. Two plays later, however, Cincinnati's drive {{came to an end}} when Virginia Tech defender Stephan Virgil intercepted a pass from Pike to a player in the end zone, denying the Bearcats a chance to score. Virgil was downed in the end zone for a touchback, and Virginia Tech's offense started at its 20-yard line after the turnover.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Lansbury {{returned}} to London's West End {{to perform in}} the Royal Shakespeare Company's theatrical production of Edward Albee's All <b>Over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Aldwych Theatre. She portrayed the mistress of a dying New England millionaire, and although the play's reviews were mixed, Lansbury's acting was widely praised. This was followed by her reluctant involvement in a revival of Mame, which was then touring the United States, after which she {{returned to}} the West End to play the character of Rose in the musical Gypsy. She had initially turned down the role, not wishing to be in the shadow of Ethel Merman, who had portrayed the character in the original Broadway production, but eventually accepted it; when the show started in May 1973, she earned a standing ovation and rave reviews. Settling into a Belgravia flat, she was soon in demand among London society, having dinners held in her honour. Following the culmination of the London run, in 1974 Gypsy went {{on a tour of the}} U.S., and in Chicago Lansbury was awarded the Sarah Siddons Award for her performance. The show eventually reached Broadway, where it ran until January 1975; a critical success, it earned Lansbury her third Tony Award. After several months' break, Gypsy then toured throughout the country again in the summer of 1975.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma's next drive ran 18 {{plays and}} 87 yards taking up 7:26. Once again, the Sooners stalled {{in the red}} zone and were again forced {{to settle for a}} field goal, this time a 24-yarder by Michael Hunnicutt. The next two drives by Texas A and Oklahoma both ended in interceptions thrown by Manziel and Jones respectively. Texas A took <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Oklahoma 48 yardline {{following}} Jones' interception. A trick play to start the drive resulted in senior wide receiver Kenric McNeal throwing a 20-yard pass to Mike Evans. On the next play, running back Ben Malena running the ball 23 yards to the five yardline. Manziel ran for a 5-yard touchdown on the next play to make the score 14–6. Oklahoma's next drive lasted 13 plays and 83 yards that culminated in a 6-yard touchdown pass from Jones to Justin Brown.|$|E
