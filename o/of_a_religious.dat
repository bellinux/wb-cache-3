5|$|In March 2012, the Roman Catholic Church, while {{supportive}} of ACA's objectives, voiced concern through the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops that {{aspects of the}} mandate covering contraception and sterilization and HHS's narrow definition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> organization violated the First Amendment right to {{free exercise of religion}} and conscience.

5|$|In the United Kingdom, The Scout Association {{had been}} criticised for its {{insistence on the}} use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> promise, leading to the {{introduction}} of an alternative in January 2014 for those not wanting to mention a god in their promise.

5|$|Possibly {{more than}} 1000 stave churches {{were built in}} Norway during the Middle Ages, most of them during the 12th and 13th centuries.

Many were destroyed as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> movement that favored simple, puritan lines, and today only 28 remain, though a large number were documented and recorded by measured drawings before they were demolished.|$|E

5|$|The {{conscription}} law of World War I {{provided for}} noncombatant service for members <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> organization whose members were forbidden {{from participating in}} war of any form. This exemption effectively limited conscientious objector status {{to members of the}} historic peace churches: Mennonites (and other Anabaptist groups such as Hutterites), Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and Church of the Brethren. The law gave the President authority to assign such draftees to any noncombatant military role.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of the Book of the Dead was known {{as early as the}} Middle Ages, well before its contents could be understood. Since it was found in tombs, it was evidently a document <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> nature, and this led to the widespread misapprehension that the Book of the Dead was the equivalent of a Bible or Qur'an.|$|E

5|$|Each {{of these}} priests, either as secular clergy, or as previously, members <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> order, is obligated {{to say the}} “Holy Office” every day. To this end, cathedrals {{normally}} {{have a number of}} small chapels used for private devotion or for small groups. In England there is a strong tradition that each chapel should face the east. For this reason the transepts of English cathedrals are longer than those in most other countries, and there is often a second transept, as at Salisbury. This arrangement permits a greater number of eastward-facing chapels. That part of the main interior which is furthest to the east and reserved for the prayers of the clergy is the presbytery.|$|E

5|$|In 1548 Charles {{declared}} an interreligio imperialis (also {{known as the}} Augsburg Interim) through which he sought to find some common ground for religious peace. This effort alienated both Protestant and Catholic princes and the papacy; even Charles, whose decree it was, was unhappy with the political and diplomatic dimensions of what amounted to half <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> settlement. The 1551–52 sessions convened by Pope Julius III at the supposedly ecumenical Council of Trent solved none of the larger religious issues but simply restated Catholic teaching and condemned Protestant teaching as heresies.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, {{in tandem}} with his work at All Souls, Henson acted as tutor to Lyle Rathbone, son of the philanthropic {{businessman}} William Rathbone. The family lived in Birkenhead, where for six months Henson stayed with them. He had ample leisure time, much of which he spent in visiting local churches and nonconformist chapels. This process left him struggling with doctrinal questions, but sure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> vocation. The day after his return to Oxford in October 1885 he went into St Mary's, Iffley, and {{with his hand on}} the altar vowed to dedicate himself to God and the Church.|$|E
5|$|In February 1217, Louis {{set sail}} for France to gather reinforcements.

This declaration resulted {{in a series of}} defections from the rebel movement, and the tide of the conflict swung in Henry's favour. Louis returned at the end of April, but his northern forces were defeated by William Marshal at the Battle of Lincoln in May.|$|E

5|$|Other {{theories}} {{of foul play}} have suggested an attack by Riffian pirates, who were active {{off the coast of}} Morocco in the 1870s. Charles Edey Fay, in his 1942 account, observes that pirates would have looted the ship, yet the personal possessions of captain and crew, some of significant value, were left undisturbed. In 1925, the historian John Gilbert Lockhart surmised that Briggs, in a fit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> mania, had slaughtered all on board and then killed himself. In a later edition of his book Lockhart, who had by then spoken to Briggs's descendants, apologized and withdrew this theory.|$|E

During Sanchez's presentation to potential Asian customers, Dario discovers Bond and betrays him to Sanchez. Bond starts {{a fire in}} the laboratory, but is captured again and placed on the conveyor belt that drops the brick-cocaine into a giant shredder.
