By 1025, the date of Basil II's death, the Byzantine Empire stretched from Armenia in the east to Calabria in Southern Italy in the west. Many successes had been achieved, ranging from the conquest of Bulgaria to the annexation of parts <b>of</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>and</b> Armenia, and the reconquest of Crete, Cyprus, and the important city of Antioch. These were not temporary tactical gains but long-term reconquests.|$|E

The name Tamar is of Hebrew origin and, like other biblical names, was favored by the Georgian Bagrationi dynasty because of their claim to be descended from David, the second king of Israel.|$|E

5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University <b>of</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>and</b> Duke University, Boyd began in academia {{as a professor of}} physics at West Georgia College. He then became a professor at Georgia Tech and a prominent researcher at the Engineering Experiment Station, now known as the Georgia Tech Research Institute. At the Engineering Experiment Station, Boyd helped spur the organization's mainstay: federally funded electronics research and development. Along with fellow Georgia Tech researchers Gerald Rosselot and Glen P. Robinson, Boyd was influential in the founding of Scientific Atlanta, where he was a board member for 25 years. As director of the Engineering Experiment Station, Boyd focused on the recruitment of talented engineers and an increase in physical space available to the organization, including the establishment of nuclear research at Georgia Tech with a radioisotopes laboratory and the construction of the Frank H. Neely Research Reactor.|$|E
5|$|Although DuMont's {{programming}} pre-dated videotape, many DuMont offerings {{were recorded}} on kinescopes. These kinescopes {{were said to}} be stored in a warehouse until the 1970s. Actress Edie Adams, the wife of comedian Ernie Kovacs (both regular performers on early television) testified in 1996 before a panel of the Library of Congress on the preservation of television and video. Adams claimed that so little value was given to these films that the stored kinescopes were loaded into three trucks and dumped into Upper New York Bay. Nevertheless, a number of DuMont programs survive at The Paley Center for Media in New York City, the UCLA Film and Television Archive in Los Angeles, in the Peabody Awards Collection at the University <b>of</b> <b>Georgia,</b> <b>and</b> the Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago.|$|E

5|$|As a {{cost-saving}} move, {{effective on}} July 1, 1934, the Georgia Board of Regents transferred {{control of the}} relatively large Evening School of Commerce to the University <b>of</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>and</b> moved the small civil engineering program at UGA to Tech. The move was controversial, and both students and faculty protested against it, fearing that the Board of Regents would remove other programs from Georgia Tech and reduce it to an engineering department of the University of Georgia. Brittain suggested {{that the lack of}} Georgia Tech alumni on the Board of Regents contributed to their decision. Despite the pressure, the Board of Regents held its ground. The Depression also {{had a significant impact on}} the athletic program, as most athletes were in the commerce school, and resulted in the elimination of athletic scholarships, which were replaced by a loan program. Plans for an industrial management department to replace and supersede the Evening School of Commerce were first made in fall 1934. The department was established in 1935, and evolved into Tech's College of Management.|$|E
5|$|Gary Edward Varner (born March 10, 1957) is an American philosopher specialising in {{environmental}} ethics, philosophical {{questions related to}} animal rights and animal welfare, and R. M. Hare's two-level utilitarianism. He is currently {{a professor in the}} Department of Philosophy at Texas A University, and has been based at the university since 1990. He was educated at Arizona State University, the University <b>of</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>and</b> the University of Wisconsin–Madison; at Madison, where he was supervised by Jon Morline, he wrote one of the first doctoral theses on environmental ethics. Varner's first monograph was In Nature's Interests?, which was published by Oxford University Press in 1998. In the book, Varner defended a form of biocentric individualism, according to which all living entities have morally considerable interests.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1740s, the South Carolina provincial half-galley Beaufort was {{stationed}} in a cove at {{the southern tip of}} Hilton Head to guard against intrusions by the Spanish of St. Augustine. The point and cove are named after Captain David Cutler Braddock, commander of the Beaufort. Captain Braddock was a mariner and privateer of note in Colonial times. Earlier, he had been placed in command of the Georgia schooner Norfolk by James Oglethorpe, founder <b>of</b> <b>Georgia,</b> <b>and</b> helped chase the Spanish back to St. Augustine after their failed 1742 invasion of St. Simons Island. After relocating to Savannah in 1746, he served two terms in the Georgia Commons House of Assembly while earning a living as a highly active privateer. He drew a well-known chart of the Florida Keys while on a privateering venture in 1756. The chart is in the Library of Congress.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{formation}} of the storm, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm watch for the coastal area between Pascagoula, Mississippi and the Suwannee River in Florida. A tropical storm warning for the region between Grand Isle, Louisiana and Apalachicola, Florida replaced the watch, though it was discontinued east of Apalachicola. All tropical cyclone warnings and watches were discontinued by 1800 UTC on September14, as there was no longer a need for the advisories. After the landfall, officials issued flood watches for inland parts of Mississippi and Alabama as well as for western portions <b>of</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>and</b> the Carolinas. On Dauphin Island in Alabama, some residents boarded up windows and filled sandbags provided by local fire departments to prepare for Hanna. The Red Cross opened 10 shelters throughout the Gulf Coast region.|$|E
5|$|The 1804 Antigua–Charleston {{hurricane}} {{was first}} sighted on 3September as it swept past Saint Barthélemy, Saint Kitts, and Antigua, drifting toward the west-northwest and soon approaching Puerto Rico and the Turks and Caicos Islands. The storm reached the Bahamas while turning northward on 4September, nearing the northern Floridan coast by 6September. It remained offshore on 7September, gradually approaching the coast throughout the day, and eventually made landfall that evening along the coasts <b>of</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>and</b> South Carolina. Observations in Savannah, Georgia, indicated north-to-northeast winds throughout 8September, though other reports recorded northeast-to-easterly gusts; at Charleston, South Carolina, however, winds, initially northeast-to-east, curved southeastward {{later in the}} storm. Little information exists on the hurricane's whereabouts between North Carolina and New England, with a single report at Norfolk, Virginia of east-northeasterly winds veering east-to-east-southeast from 7to 9September, suggesting the disturbance's passage west of there. A severe gale arrived in New England on 11and 12September, though the long pause between {{the departure of the}} hurricane from the Carolinas and its arrival in the northeastern United States evidences the possibility that the two systems may have been unrelated.|$|E
5|$|The 1804 Antigua–Charleston {{hurricane}} was {{the most}} severe hurricane in Georgia since 1752, causing over 500deaths and at least $1.6million (1804USD) in damage throughout the Southeastern United States. Originating near Antigua on 3September, it initially drifted west-northwestward, soon nearing Puerto Rico. Throughout its existence in the Caribbean Sea, the hurricane damaged, destroyed, and capsized numerous ships, and at Saint Kitts, it {{was considered to be}} the worst since 1772. By 4September, the storm arrived at the Bahamas and turned northward before approaching the coast of northern Florida on 6September. The hurricane eventually came ashore along the coastline <b>of</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>and</b> South Carolina while producing mostly southeasterly winds. A severe gale was noted in New England later that month, on 11and 12September, although it was likely not the same system as that which had passed through the Caribbean and southeastern United States earlier that month.|$|E
