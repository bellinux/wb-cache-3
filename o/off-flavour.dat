40|$|Tea {{seems to}} be like a logical {{substrate}} for iron fortification; however, its fortification with iron presents technical challenges as tea polyphenols form a blue complex with iron that makes both of them unavailable for absorption. The objective of this work was to develop an effective technology, to prevent the interaction of iron and polyphenols by using EDTA as a competing complexing agent. Fortified tea was prepared from premix, prepared by spraying iron and sodium EDTA into tea leaves. Iron concentration in tea was adjusted to 5 [*]mg/cup. Iron content was measured by AAS and the iron-polyphenol complex by spectrophotometry at 560 [*]nm. Sensory evaluation was carried out in order to determine if fortification affects the properties of tea. A molar ratio of 1 [*]:[*] 2 Fe[*]:[*]EDTA was able to avoid complex formation and provide 4 [*]mg of iron per cup of brewed tea. The fortified tea had a similar colour and flavour as ordinary tea, without the development of <b>off-flavours.</b> However, fortified tea with a ratio lower than 1 [*]:[*] 2 had a darker colour and <b>off-flavours.</b> By the addition of EDTA in a molar ratio ≥ 1 [*]:[*] 2, it is possible to produce an iron fortified tea without the formation of <b>off-flavours...</b>|$|R

50|$|Spoilage by Z. bailii often {{occurs in}} acidic {{shelf-stable}} foods, which rely upon the combined effects of acidity (e.g. vinegar), salt and sugar to suppress microbial growth. The spoiled foods usually display sensorial changes {{that can be}} easily recognized by consumers, thus resulting in significant economic losses due to consumers’ complaints or product recalls Observable signs of spoilage include product leakage from containers, colour change, emission of unpleasant yeasty odours, emulsion separation (in mayonnaises, dressings), turbidity, flocculation or sediment formation (in wines, beverages) and visible colonies or brown film development on product surfaces. The specific <b>off-flavour</b> that has been attributed to Z. bailii is related to H2S. In addition, the taste of spoiled foods can be modified by the production of acetic acid and fruity esters. It has been reported that growth of Z. bailii also results in significant gas and ethanol formation, causing a typical alcoholic taste. The excessive gas production is a direct consequence of high fermentable ability of this yeast and in more solid food, gas bubbles can appear within the product. Under extreme circumstances, the produced gas pressure inside glass jars or bottles can reach such a level that explosions may take place, creating an additional hazard of injuries from broken glass. It should be mentioned that in general, detectable spoilage by yeasts requires the presence of a high number of cells, approximately 5 - 6 log CFU/ml.|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} of compounds producing a characteristic <b>off-flavour</b> in fresh beef meat obtained from different locations {{is essential to}} avoid consumer rejection. The volatile compounds of fresh beef samples were extracted by solid phase micro extraction (SPME) and their odour was evaluated by using olfactometry analysis (GC-O). The compound responsible for the characteristic <b>off-flavour</b> was identified by using GC–MS and quantified in different beef samples obtained from different locations. The sniffing analysis revealed eight odour active zones being four of them identified as 2, 3 -butanedione, allyl methyl sulfide, 1 -(methylthio) propane and 1 -(methylthio) - 1 -propene (Z). The most potent odorant was 1 -(methylthio) propane described as garlic, cabbage, oxidized iron, solvent and rancid odour.

Then the corks after exposition to coatings were placed {{in direct contact with}} wines. Different styles of white, red and rosé wines were tested. In both directly exposed wines and in wines after contact with the exposed cork, taste and smell <b>off-flavour</b> perception and intensity were assessed by a panel of 8 experienced wine tasters using a 5 point numerical scale according to ISO standard methods. The results show that the sensory characters of wines, especially taste, are influenced by coating VOCs contents.

Although most of the producers of geosmin and MIB have been identified as Streptomyces species or cyanobacteria, Streptomyces spp. are thought to be responsible for the synthesis of these compounds in indoor recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). The detection of genes involved in the synthesis of geosmin and MIB can be a relevant indicator of the beginning of <b>off-flavour</b> events in RAS. Here, we report a real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) protocol targeting geoA sequences that encode a germacradienol synthase involved in geosmin synthesis. New geoA-related sequences were retrieved from eleven geosmin-producing Actinomycete strains, among them two Streptomyces strains isolated from two RAS. Combined with geoA-related sequences available in gene databases, we designed primers and standards suitable for qPCR assays targeting mainly Streptomyces geoA. Using our qPCR protocol, we succeeded in measuring the level of geoA copies in sand filter and biofilters in two RAS. This study is the first to apply qPCR assays to detect and quantify the geosmin synthesis gene (geoA) in RAS.
