5|$|Polar bears can be {{hunted for}} sport in Canada {{with a special}} permit and accompaniment by a local guide. This can be an {{important}} source of income for small communities, as guided hunts bring in more income than selling the polar bear hide on markets. The United States, Russia, Norway, Greenland, and Canada allow subsistence hunting, and Canada distributes hunting permits to indigenous communities. The selling of these permits is a main source of income for many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>communities.</b> Their hides can be used for subsistence purposes, kept as hunting trophies, or can be bought in markets.|$|E

The festival {{was seen as a}} day of peace and certain activities were prohibited such as the planting of crops before the day of the ceremony, the splitting of wood and unnecessary noise. Igu Aro was a regular event that gave an opportunity for the eze to speak directly to all the communities under him.|$|E

A TWINSPAN classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, revealed fourteen plant communities, and a hierarchical classification, description and ecological interpretation <b>of</b> <b>these</b> plant <b>communities</b> are presented. Each <b>of</b> <b>these</b> plant <b>communities</b> may be regarded as an entity with a unique species composition, and with specific environmental relationships and an inherent forage production potential.

40|$|The {{structure}} of Brazil's National Health System (SUS) is being firmed up through programs {{adding a new}} element to its multi-professional healthcare teams: Community Healthcare Agents. This study examines psycho-social factors that are significant {{for the construction of}} this identity, from the standpoint <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>Community</b> Healthcare Agents, using the hermeneutic phenomenology of Paul Ricoeur as its reference methodology. The subjects of this survey were seven Community Healthcare Agents who were asked during interviews (with informed consent and after approval by the Research Ethics Committee) to: 'Tell me about your experience as Community Healthcare Agent'. The analysis of their replies indicated the following topics: previous experience; capacity-building for the job; bonding; building up expertise; gratifying experience; feelings of power(lessness); communications; daily work routines, personal growth; criticisms of the institution; user-agent experiences; and insertion into the social reality. The overall analysis disclosed the phenomenon through the convergence and divergence of the grouping <b>of</b> <b>these</b> topics, viewed from the standpoint <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>Community</b> Healthcare Agents and the psycho-social aspects constructing their identity...|$|R
