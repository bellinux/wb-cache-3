Alien pathogens could decimate the human population, which would have no immunity to them, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> use terrestrial livestock or plants as hosts, causing indirect harm to humans. Invasive organisms brought by extraterrestrial civilizations could cause great ecological harm because of the terrestrial biosphere's lack of defenses against them.|$|E
5|$|At times, when a {{new king}} came to power, old stelae would be respectfully buried and {{replaced}} with new ones, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be broken. When a Maya city was invaded by a rival, it was pillaged by the victors. One {{of the most striking}} archaeological markers of such an invasion is the destruction of the defeated city's stelae, which were broken and cast down. At the end of the Preclassic, around 150 AD, this fate appears to have befallen the important city of El Mirador, where most of the stelae were found smashed.|$|E
5|$|Paleontology {{also has}} some overlap with archaeology, which {{primarily}} works with objects made by humans and with human remains, while paleontologists {{are interested in the}} characteristics and evolution of humans as organisms. When dealing with evidence about humans, archaeologists and paleontologists may work together– for example paleontologists might identify animal or plant fossils around an archaeological site, to discover what the people who lived there ate; <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> analyze the climate at the time when the site was inhabited by humans.|$|E

5|$|The African river martin feeds in flocks over {{river and}} forest, often far from water. It eats insects, mainly taking winged ants. The flight {{is strong and}} fast, {{interspersed}} with glides. Wintering birds regularly perch on treetops, wires and roofs. The white-eyed river martin feeds on insects, including beetles, which are caught on the wing. Given its size and unusual mouth structure, it may take larger insects than other swallows. This species is described as graceful and buoyant in flight, and, like its African relative, appears reluctant to use perches. This behaviour, together with its unusual toe-shape {{and the fact that}} mud was found on the toes of one of the first specimens, suggests that this species may be relatively terrestrial. In winter, it roosts with barn swallows in reedbeds. Pamela C. Rasmussen suggested that, given its unusually large eyes, the species might be nocturnal or crepuscular, a factor that could make it highly cryptic and thus partly explain how such a distinctive species remained undetected for so long. Although the fact that the first specimens were supposedly collected roosting at night in reed-beds might be a contraindication, {{it is possible that the}} birds might not actually have been caught at the roost; <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be crepuscular, feeding at dawn and dusk; <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be capable of both diurnal and nocturnal behaviour, depending on the season or local circumstances.|$|E

25|$|In {{some areas}} such as Cape Peninsula, the sparrowhawks face habitat {{competition}} with Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegyptiaca), an aggressive species known to steal the nests of the sparrowhawks. This results in a costly loss for the sparrowhawks after the time and energy spent building the nest and may also lead {{to the death of}} current offspring. However, sparrowhawks occasionally have more than 1 nest at a time, or they can readily build a new nest, so, in the event that one is usurped by an Egyptian goose, the pair will sometimes start breeding again in a nearby alternative nest; <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> wait until the geese have left the nest with their goslings, or they abandon breeding for that year.|$|E

Colectivos often cross municipal borders into the corresponding metropolitan areas. In some cases there are diferenciales (special services) which are faster, and notably more expensive. Bus lines in a given city might be run by different private companies and/or by the municipal state, and they might be painted in different colours for easier identification. The city of Buenos Aires has in recent years been expanding its Metrobus BRT system to compliment its existing Underground network and it is estimated that, along with other measures, it will increase the city's use of public transport by 30 percent.|$|E

25|$|The {{software}} distribution {{of a product}} can be done offline as well as online. In an offline situation the package is a physical package which contains all the elements. The software is stored on a data carrier such as a CD or a DVD, and the documents might also be stored in a digital form on this data carrier, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be in physical form such as a booklet. The package {{as a whole is}} a physical product. In an online situation the entire package needs to be in a digital form. The consequences on the distribution process are described in the following paragraphs. CCU is designed to fit both situations but as bandwidth is growing it is making more sense to distribute especially updates and new versions to existing customers online. In this article both ways are discussed. In the process-data model it is assumed that the software vendor conducts both distribution channels. As a practical example: HISComp, a provider of medical information systems distributes its software straightforward via CDs. However they use their website to distribute patches for the software products.|$|E
25|$|In a {{religious}} context, the word fatwa carries more meaning. This is because when a Muslim {{has a question}} {{that they need to}} be answered from an Islamic point of view, they ask an Islamic scholar this question, and the answer is known as a fatwa. This fatwa is said by followers to carry more weight than just the random opinion of any person. Muslim scholars are expected to give their fatwa based on religious scripture, not just their personal opinions. Therefore, their fatwa is sometimes regarded as {{a religious}} ruling. Here is an example of a fatwa: Muslims are expected to pray five times every day at specific times during the day. A person who is going to be on a 12-hour flight may not be able to perform their prayers on time. So they might ask a Muslim scholar for a fatwa on what is the appropriate thing to do, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> look up the answer in a book or on the internet. The scholar might advise them to perform the prayer to the best of their ability on the plane, or to delay their prayer until they land, for example. And they would support their opinion with scripture. The fatwa is not legally binding or final, it is a respected interpretation of the sharia given by a mufti on a particular case. If the individual doesn't like the fatwa given, he/she can seek out another Mufti or Qadi for a second opinion which might have the desired outcome.|$|E

500|$|Textile and {{clothing}} production {{was a major}} source of employment. Both textiles and finished garments were traded among the peoples of the Empire, whose products were often named for them or a particular town, rather like a fashion [...] "label". Better ready-to-wear was exported by businessmen (negotiatores or mercatores) who were often well-to-do residents of the production centres. Finished garments might be retailed by their sales agents, who travelled to potential customers, or by vestiarii, clothing dealers who were mostly freedmen; <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be peddled by itinerant merchants. In Egypt, textile producers could run prosperous small businesses employing apprentices, free workers earning wages, and slaves. The fullers (fullones) and dye workers (coloratores) had their own guilds. Centonarii were guild workers who specialized in textile production and the recycling of old clothes into pieced goods.|$|E
500|$|Neutron {{activation}} analysis indicates {{that much of}} the black-on-white pottery found at Mesa Verde was produced locally. Cretaceous clays from both the Dakota and Menefee Formations were used in black-on-white wares, and Mancos Formation clays for corrugated jars. Evidence that pottery of both types moved between several locations around the region suggests interaction between groups of ancient potters, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have shared a common source of raw materials. The Mesa Verde black-on-white pottery was produced at three locations: Sand Canyon, Castle Rock, and Mesa Verde. Archeological evidence indicates that nearly every household had at least one member who worked as a potter. Trench kilns were constructed away from pueblos and closer to sources of firewood. Their sizes vary, but the larger ones were up to [...] long and thought to have been shared kilns that served several families.

Also, there is sometimes a tendency to absorb the other party into one’s own self-understanding, to reduce the unknown into what is already known, absorbing it into a system. Theorists of crosscultural exchange like Raimundo Panikkar have argued that instead of projecting oneself into the other party or absorbing it into a system of one’s own devising that one should be open to something completely new and different in the other culture. This will lead to seeing both the other culture and one’s own culture in new and different ways. Thereby one can integrate into one’s life the familiar with the new...|$|R
