A total of 694 Campylobacter isolates from the conventional and <b>organic</b> <b>poultry</b> operations were tested for antimicrobial resistance to nine antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method. Although Campylobacter species were highly prevalent in both the conventional and <b>organic</b> <b>poultry</b> operations, the antimicrobial resistance rates were significantly different between the organic operations and the conventional operations. Less than 2 % of Campylobacter strains isolated from organically raised poultry were resistant to fluoroquinolones, while 46 % and 67 % of Campylobacter isolates from conventionally raised broilers and conventionally raised turkeys, respectively, were resistant to these antimicrobials. In addition, a high frequency of resistance to erythromycin (80 %), clindamycin (64 %), kanamycin (76 %), and ampicillin (31 %) was observed among Campylobacter isolates from conventionally raised turkeys. None of the Campylobacter isolates obtained {{in this study was}} resistant to gentamicin, while a large number of the isolates from both conventional and <b>organic</b> <b>poultry</b> operations were resistant to tetracycline.

30|$|The {{experiment}} {{involved the}} formulation of soil-based nursery media from topsoil, three sources of <b>organic</b> manures (<b>poultry</b> droppings, pig slurry and cattle dung) and two aerators (sawdust and rice-husk dust). A {{small portion of the}} farm under fallow was identified and cleared, and the needed topsoil collected from the surface layer (0 – 20  cm) of the soil. The soil, deeply weathered brownish red coarse-textured (sandy loam) Ultisols, is underlain by false-bedded sandstone. The topsoil was air-dried and homogenised by thorough mixing. Two of the manures, poultry droppings and pig slurry, were procured from the poultry and piggery units, respectively, of the animal section of the farm while the third, cattle dung, was sourced from the local abattoir. All the manures were cured by sun-drying and then crushed and sieved. The sawdust was collected from the ‘Timber Shed’ at Nsukka and the rice-husk dust from its dumpsite around a rice mill at nearby Adani, both in southeastern Nigeria.|$|R
30|$|At mid-altitude, {{the soils}} under natural savanna, and those under {{farmland}} {{had the highest}} mean soil available phosphorus concentrations (15.6 and 15.5  ppm, respectively), while those under natural forest and E. saligna plantation land cover systems were intermediate (14.6 and 11.1  ppm, respectively). Those under afforestation and grazing land use had the lowest values (9.83 and 9.33  ppm, respectively). It can be concluded here that residue ash may have enhanced the P concentrations under natural savanna, and those under farmland because burning was a cultural phenomenon under these land use systems in the area. Also, the application of chemical P-fertilizers and <b>organic</b> manure (<b>poultry</b> manure and cow dung) may have enhanced the P concentrations in selected farmlands in this area. At this altitude, mean soil available phosphorus concentrations at the surface (0 – 15  cm) layer showed no significant difference (P >  0.01) between the soils under all the land use/land cover systems.|$|R
