The player controls Talion, a Ranger who bonds with the wraith of the Elf Lord Celebrimbor, as the two set out to avenge the deaths <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>ones.</b> Players can engage in melee combat, and use wraith abilities to fight and manipulate enemies. The game introduces the Nemesis System, which allows the artificial intelligence of non-playable characters to remember {{the deaths of the}} game's protagonist and react accordingly.|$|E
5|$|In places closely {{associated}} with Titanic, the sense of grief was deep. The heaviest losses were in Southampton, home port to 699crew members and also home {{to many of the}} passengers. Crowds of weeping women– the wives, sisters and mothers of crew– gathered outside the White Star offices in Southampton for news <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>ones.</b> Most of them were among the 549Southampton residents who perished. In Belfast, churches were packed, and shipyard workers wept in the streets. The ship had been a symbol of Belfast's industrial achievements, and there was not only a sense of grief but also one of guilt, as those who had built Titanic came to feel they had been responsible in some way for her loss.|$|E
5|$|Diane {{remained}} {{in love with}} Victor, and stole his frozen sperm to artificially inseminate herself. Unbeknownst to her, Ashley had also stolen Victor’s sperm to inseminate herself. Diane gave birth to Christian Victor Newman, but was shocked to discover the sperm she’d stolen was that of Jack. Ashley had received Victor’s actual sperm sample and gives birth to Abby Carlton, whom she decides to pass off as Brad’s child. Victor and Nikki later reunite, and in 2002, Maxwell Hollister (Sam Behrens) attempts to destroy Victor, using his estranged wife, revealed to be Lorie Brooks, in his plot. Originally, Max attempted to lead a hostile takeover of Julia Newman Martin's design firm, which Victor prevented. Now, Max used Lorie to keep Victor and Nikki apart, but Lorie could not follow through, and a ruined Max ends up leaving town. Months after, Victor and Nikki remarry {{in front of all}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>ones.</b> Ashley reveals that Abby is in fact Victor’s daughter as she was diagnosed with cancer, and he welcomes her with open arms. After rescuing Nikki from a carjacker, Victor is diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. Victor and Nikki's marriage slowly strained as he was caught up in taking Jabot Cosmetics away from Jack, dealing with NVP Retreats, and Nikki's campaign for State Senator, which resulted in an affair with her campaign manager David Chow. Victor and Nikki eventually divorce after six years in 2008. Soon after, Hope dies and Victor’s estranged son, now known as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), comes to Genoa City and works at Newman Enterprises.|$|E
40|$|This {{review of}} {{literature}} describes recently published research on preparing family members for the death <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> with advanced cancer and discusses directions for further research. A search was conducted among 5 electronic databases. A total of 18 articles published between January 2000 and September 2011 were identified and included in this review. The literature revealed that the current trends of research are to study (1) the awareness of {{family members of the}} impending death <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> and (2) the 4 dimensions of preparedness. Comprehensive studies needed are to explore family members' preparation for the death <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> with advanced cancer, including the awareness and time frame of family members for the death <b>of</b> a <b>loved</b> one; <b>their</b> preparedness including medical, psychosocial, spiritual, and practical dimensions; and communication and support received from healthcare professionals. Expanding understanding of preparing family members for the death will enable healthcare professionals to develop innovative interventions to improve family members' preparation for the death <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> and to ease <b>their</b> bereavement.

5000|$|Palliative care is an {{especially}} demanding task for cancer caregivers than less progressive cancer because the care required for those with terminal cancer {{tends to be more}} demanding. [...] Caregivers in this situation often report high caregiver burden lasting the entire period. Caregiver distress also tends to increase as patients progress through this phase, causing a lower caregiver quality of life. Having a difficult time with caregiving increases distress caregivers face as they enter the bereavement period after the death <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one,</b> whereas finding meaning in caring for <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> may relate to better long term adjustment for caregivers. Before bereavement, <b>loved</b> <b>ones</b> often face anticipatory grief, where they mourn and prepare for the loss <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one.</b> Families often react with fears of abandonment, anxiety, hopelessness and helplessness, and an intensified attachment to <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one.</b> Upon the death <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one,</b> caregivers typically experience grief, which in a minority of cases may be complicated by a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder later in the grief process.|$|R
50|$|Many {{services}} are also {{held in the}} Vietnamese burial practices. One is held before moving the coffin from {{the home and the}} other is held at the burial site. After the burial of the <b>loved</b> <b>one,</b> incense is burned at the gravesite and respect is paid to all the nearby graves. Following this, the family and friends return to the home and enjoy a feast to celebrate the life of the recently departed. Even after the deceased has been buried, the respect and honor continues. For the first 49 days after the burying, the family holds a memorial service every 7 days, where the family and friends come back together to celebrate the life <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one.</b> After this, they meet again on the 100th day after the death, then 265 days after the death, and finally they meet on the anniversary of the death <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one,</b> a whole year later, to continue to continue to celebrate the glorious life <b>of</b> <b>their</b> recently departed.|$|R

25|$|There is {{one main}} war {{memorial}}, or cenotaph, in Denton, located in Victoria Park. This memorial commemorates people from Denton and Haughton {{who served in}} two world wars. The names on the war memorial were collected from their relatives who wrote to the council with details <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>ones</b> who served in either war. The war memorial was unveiled on 23 July 1921.

In September 1929, Davis returned to Wilberforce University as professor of military science and tactics. He {{was assigned}} to the Tuskegee Institute {{in the early part of}} 1931, and remained there for six years as professor of military science and tactics.

25|$|During {{the fall}} of Troy, Helen's role is ambiguous. In Virgil's Aeneid, Deiphobus gives an account of Helen's treacherous stance: when the Trojan Horse was {{admitted}} into the city, she feigned Bacchic rites, leading a chorus of Trojan women, and, holding a torch among them, she signaled to the Greeks from the city's central tower. In Odyssey, however, Homer narrates a different story: Helen circled the Horse three times, and she imitated {{the voices of the}} Greek women left behind at home—she thus tortured the men inside (including Odysseus and Menelaus) with the memory <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>ones,</b> and brought them to the brink of destruction.* Hughes, Helen of Troy, 220; Suzuki, Metamorphoses of Helen, 99–100.|$|E
50|$|However, Mother Moeini {{was more}} {{determined}} than before to seek justice. During {{the early days}} of discovering mass graves at Khavaran she was among the first survivors to head to the site and see the mass graves, and partially covered body parts and clothing, crows dining on the corpses <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> and attacks by Islamic Revolutionary Guards who denied them the right to weep at the side <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one’s</b> grave. She searched for Homayoun with her bare hands and came across beige-coloured trousers resembling a pair worn by Homayoun. The shock of this experience never left Mother Moeini. She honoured the memory of Homayoun {{on the first day of}} September each year hosting family and friends at her home. She also supported and attended memorials in honour of other victims. Regardless of regular harassment, beatings and other forms of abuse, she was among those who attended to Khavaran on the last Friday of each month and visited other Khavaran mothers and families so long as she was physically able to. However, the authorities move to deny the families access to Khavaran was the last blow to her frail body.|$|R

25|$|Helena Lopata {{argued that}} a Polish {{nationalism}} grew in Polish Americans during World War I, but fell sharply afterward. Polish immigrants to the United States did not know much about Poland aside from their local villages. In preparation for World War I, the Polish government asked for donations using appeals {{on behalf of the}} safety <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>ones</b> back home, as well as promises of a good high status back in Poland when they returned home. Lopata found that after World War I, many Polish Americans continued to receive requests for aid in Poland, and feelings of anger for all the years they had delayed bettering their own situation were common. Return immigrants who had dreamed of using their American savings to buy status symbols in Poland (farmlands, houses, etc.) were still treated as peasants in Poland, creating resentment towards the motherland.|$|E

Ellie meets an extraterrestrial in a form indistinguishable from Ted Arroway, who explains his people's reasons for making contact, and tells her of their ongoing project to alter the properties of the universe by accumulating enough mass in Cygnus A to counter the effects of entropy. He also tells her that the wormhole system was built by unknown precursors, and hints at the discovery of artificial messages in transcendental numbers like π.

500|$|According to Hoshino, the series' main theme {{focuses on}} tragedy. Many {{characters}} such as Allen across the series suffer poor fates such as losing {{a loved one}} and being tempted to revive them by the Earl. Although this works, the people are revived as Akumas who consume the skin <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>ones.</b> This has led to state that an initial theme is that people should not be brought back to life. Although some characters like Kanda express unconditional love to Alma, their happiness is short-lived due to Alma dying shortly after this with another writer finding fitting for the series' dark narrative. Additionally, Allen's life becomes sadder across the series as he is forced to abandon the Black Order due to the Pope removing his rights as an exorcist and he is treated as Noah due to his connections with these characters. Nevertheless, Hoshino still {{tried to make it}} fun for the readers, stating that Allen will always have allies.|$|E
500|$|Michael G. Wilson {{decided on}} the film's title Quantum of Solace only [...] "a few days" [...] before its {{announcement}} on 24 January 2008. It {{was the name of}} a short story in Ian Fleming's anthology For Your Eyes Only (1960). The film is related to the title in one of its thematic elements: [...] "when the 'Quantum of Solace' drops to zero, humanity and consideration of one human for another is gone." [...] Daniel Craig admitted, [...] "I was unsure at first. Bond is looking for his quantum of solace and that's what he wants, he wants his closure. Ian Fleming says that if you don't have a quantum of solace in your relationship then the relationship is over. It's that spark of niceness in a relationship that if you don't have you might as well give up." [...] He said that [...] "Bond doesn't have that because his girlfriend [...] has been killed," [...] and therefore, [...] " [...] looking for revenge... to make himself happy with the world again." [...] Afterwards, Quantum was made the name of the organisation introduced in Casino Royale. Craig noted the letter Q itself looks rather odd. Near the end of the film, the Camille Montes character and Bond have a discussion about their individual quests to avenge the deaths <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>ones.</b> Montes asks Bond to [...] "let me know what it feels like" [...] when he succeeds, the implication of the title being {{that it will be a}} small amount of solace compared to his despair. Bond's lack of emotion when he does exact revenge shows this to be the case.|$|E

50|$|On {{the ninth}} night a table {{is set up}} under a tent with food for the <b>loved</b> <b>one,</b> though no one is allowed to eat from it before midnight because it is {{believed}} that this is the time that the spirit passes through. Along with the food are drinks, most often Jamaican rum with no less than 100 proof. The types of food on the table can vary from one celebration to the next, but typically fried fish and bammy are the main foods on the table. This time is very important to the family because it gives them time to celebrate the life <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> {{and to be able to}} say their goodbyes.|$|R
40|$|When {{a patient}} is {{extremely}} ill and/or dying, and the family expects a miraculous recovery, this situation can be very challenging to physicians, particularly when there is certainty that the miracle will occur through divine intervention. A practical approach is therefore provided to clinicians for engaging families that anticipate the miraculous healing of a sick patient. This strategy involves exploring the meaning and significance of a miracle, providing a balanced, nonargumentative response and negotiation of patient-centered compromises, while conveying respect for patient spirituality and practicing good medicine. Such an approach, tailored to the specifics of each family, can be effective in helping a family come {{to a place of}} acceptance about the impending death <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one...</b>|$|R
