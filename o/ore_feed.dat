40|$|Natural {{minerals}} {{often lack}} well defined magnetic susceptibilities. Instead {{they must be}} thought of as occurring in a susceptibility range where the bulk susceptibility is affected by present impurities. Inclusions or foreign atoms in solid solution may alter a materials magnetic properties to a large extent. Mixed particles of dia andlor paramagnetic materials display a linear relationship while ferromagnetic inclusions involve a demagnetisation factor. The susceptibility distribution of value minerals in relation to gangue in the ore is the most important factor governing magnetic separation performance. Until recently, high gradient and high intensity separators of matrix type were exclusively used in wet processing. Now, new dry separators are extending the particle range for dry, fine particle separation. The capture characteristics of the matrix has been shown to change with the magnetic field strength. The separation cut is more precise at high fields, at low fields the capture probability graph cants. By superimposing the capture function on the susceptibility distribution of an ore, it is shown that materials containing value minerals at either high or low susceptibility is ideal for HGMS separation. Complex ores carrying value and gangue minerals distributed over a wide susceptibility range are unfavourable. The former situation is common in industrial mineral processing and in the upgrading of flotation concentrates. The latter susceptibility distribution is very common in complex sulphide <b>ore</b> <b>feeds.</b> Godkänd; 1994; 20070429 (ysko...|$|R

40|$|A new {{technique}} {{for measuring the}} voidage of a packed bed of wet deformable granules is described. Rather than attempt to measure voidage in situ, the voidage is calculated from accurate measurements of bed bulk density and separate measurement of granule apparent density by kerosene displacement. The technique is reproducible to ± 0. 005 void fraction. This technique is used to study in detail the factors which determine the voidage of packed beds of granulated ferrous sinter feed. 10 sinter feed blends are used varying the type of <b>ore</b> (7 <b>ores),</b> <b>feed</b> size distribution and moisture content (3. 5 % to 8 %). As moisture content increases, bed voidage passes through a maximum. At low moisture contents, added water reduces {{the spread of the}} granule size distribution and increases the voidage. At higher moisture contents, granule deformation becomes important. Granules become more deformable as moisture content increases and the bed voidage drops. The key parameter which affects granule deformation is the granule layer mass to nuclei mass ratio (R). All blends show the same relationship between R and voidage. Voidage decreases with increasing R before approaching an asymptotic value for large values of R. The effect of feed particle size distribution, moisture holding capacity and moisture content on voidage can be explained by their effect on the layer mass to nuclei mass ratio during granulation. Hence, {{with the aid of a}} suitable granulation model, the effect of feed blend properties and granulation conditions on bed voidage can be predicted...|$|R

40|$|PUTF ProjectAfter {{studying}} the direction work in mineral liberation has taken {{for the past}} twenty years, {{and in particular the}} more recent five to ten years, it has become apparent to me that at least for the magnetic taconite process, the use of the Davis tube ideal magnetic separator on individual size fractions of process feed can provide useful data on liberation. A study made by the writer 1 of process feed samples to twelve magnetite concentrators indicated a reasonable conformity between Davis tube concentrate magnetite grade and size fraction mean particle size relationships and what was predicted using the idealized "random liberation model" formulation 2 with appropriate specific gravities for magnetite and waste minerals. This then suggests that the magnetic taconite liberation behavior can be characterized by three parameters (given the two specific gravities) : (1) magnetite <b>ore</b> <b>feed</b> grade; (2) an average mineral grain size; and (3) an average size fraction particle size. Of the twelve sample sets noted above, only two indicated significant deviations from the shape of the concentrate grade-particle size relationships displayed by the "random model. " A BASIC computer program (LIBFIT. BAS) has therefore been written to obtain the best fit of the two parameters: magnetite feed grade of the ore and average mineral grain size for the "random model," to Davis tube data on size fractions of ground taconite. The program is relatively simple in concept, in that it first seeks a value of average mineral grain size, which minimizes the sum of squares of differences in the measured and calculated Davis tube concentrate grades for an estimated magnetite feed grade of the ore. It then holds the optimum average mineral grain size constant and searches for the optimum magnetite feed grade for that mineral grain size. It continues to switch back and forth, looking at first mineral grain size and then magnetite <b>ore</b> <b>feed</b> grade for some 18 iterations, which then provides a best fit estimate of the two parameters.

40|$|By {{designing}} comminution circuits for mineral liberation {{rather than}} the final recovery process and by using high mass pull gravity recovery, the concept of underground processing has become a reality.

40|$|This paper applies Drift Flux {{theory for}} the first time to explore the {{relationship}} between the liquid and solids flow through fluidized beds in the context of desliming of dense minerals. At low solids fluxes the process is not flux curve constrained. Here continuity considerations indicate the net liquid flux through the lower bed is upwards, ideal for the removal of slimes from the underflow product. Moreover, the liquid split to the underflow is also lower, further reducing the slimes content of the underflow. At higher solids fluxes the net liquid flux becomes downwards and eventually the system becomes flux curve constrained. Under these circumstances slimes entrainment to the underflow increases significantly. In order to operate at these higher solids fluxes, and achieve efficient desliming, Split Fluidization should be used. Here additional fluidization liquid is added at a higher elevation, producing a net liquid flux in the upwards direction through the zone above the Split Fluidization entrance level. Desliming experiments covering a range of solids fluxes were conducted to investigate the effects of increasing solids flux and Split Fluidization. This study shows that a system of parallel inclined channels, a key feature of the Reflux Classifier, permits the introduction of this additional liquid while preventing the ultra fine product from being entrained to the overflow reject stream, thus permitting the efficient removal of slimes. Experiments were conducted using an iron <b>ore</b> <b>feed</b> with particles smaller than 0. 50 mm in diameter.

The new phosphate mine and mill complex located southwest of Kapuskasing, Ontario, was constructed to replace an offshore supply of phosphate rock, and produces a high-grade phosphate concentrate. The Cargill Township Car-bonatite Complex {{is one of a}} series of carbonatite complexes in the region that are hosted by the 1. 9 Ga aged Kapuskasing Structural Zone. The carbonatites in the mine area have intruded Archean gneissic granodiorite rocks of the Wawa Subprovince, and metasedimentary rocks of the Quetico Subprovince. The Cargill Carbonatite Complex displays a typical concentric zonation pattern from an outer ring of alkalic pyroxenites, through an inner ring of sövite-carbonatite, to a central core of rauhaugite-carbonatite. The initial carbonatite intrusion and subsequent residual orebody have been modified by faulting such that the northwestern third of the complex has been displaced approxi-mately 2. 5 km northeast. The phosphate ores are composed principally of residual apatite sands that were formed by the weathering and dissolution of the soluble minerals of the carbonatite protolith. These ores are subdivided by their iron content into high grade (A ores) and lower grade (B 1 and B 2) ores. They are separated from the primary unweathered carbonatite by a layer of saprolite, whose thickness varies depending upon the composition of the underlying carbonatite. Cretaceous waste materials consisting of well-sorted silica/kaolinite sand and peat deposits are typically found to stratigraphically overlie the ores.

In this paper this SAG circuit dynamic model is used to test a method for detecting changes and identifying the grindability of the ore being processed by the SAG circuit. The method used - based on the variance of the continuous wavelet transform of measured circuit variables - incorporates improvements of a previous method. Results show that a step change of new <b>feed</b> <b>ore</b> is detected in about 30 to 80 min depending on the grindability change. This result may be considered to be adequate when taking into account that the response time for the mill hold-up to attain a new equilibrium value after the ensuing transient is of about 3 h.

At 70 °C, Ni/Co extraction rates were notably lower...|$|R
