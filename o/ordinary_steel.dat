500|$|The carrier's [...] {{flight deck}} was [...] wide and {{overhung}} her hull at both ends, supported by pairs of pillars. A large island, modeled on that fitted on , was sponsoned off {{the starboard side}} and integrated with the ship's funnel. Much like the earlier Taihō design, Shinanos armored flight deck (they were the only Japanese carriers with armored flight decks) functioned as the ship's strength deck and copied British practice as seen in their [...] carriers. Designed to resist penetration by [...] bombs dropped by a dive bomber, the flight deck consisted of [...] of armor plate laid over [...] of <b>ordinary</b> <b>steel.</b> It was equipped with 15 transverse arrestor wires and three crash barriers that could stop a [...] aircraft; five of these wires were positioned further forward to allow the ship to land aircraft over the bow in case the aft portion of the flight deck was unusable.|$|E
500|$|Two {{types of}} gun design were produced: Type A was of high alloy steel, and Type B of more <b>ordinary</b> <b>steel.</b> Type B {{was chosen for}} {{production}} because it was lighter. The primers and propellant {{were the same as}} those previously chosen for Thin Man. Scale test firing of the hollow projectile and target insert was conducted with the 3-inch/50 caliber gun and a [...] Hispano cannon. Starting in December, test firing was done full-scale. Amazingly, the first test case produced {{turned out to be the}} best ever made. It was used in four test firings at the Anchor Ranch, and ultimately in the Little Boy used in the bombing of Hiroshima. The design specifications were completed in February 1945, and contracts were let to build the components. Three different plants were used so that no one would have a copy of the complete design. The gun and breech were made by the Naval Gun Factory in Washington, D.C.; the target, case and some other components were by the Naval Ordnance Plant in Center Line, Michigan; and the tail fairing and mounting brackets by the Expert Tool and Die Company in Detroit, Michigan.|$|E

A convertible chassis was used [...] wheelbase), but the Tarpon was slightly longer, [...] compared to [...] for the production Rambler American. The Tarpon's roof was lowered two inches making it only [...] high for an even more dynamic look. The top section of the new Rambler Tarpon was made of reinforced plastic. The windshield was described as [...] "bulbous" [...] and the fastback roofline featuring a [...] "skylight" [...] rear window. The swept back, double-compound curved windshield further enhanced the Tarpon's low appearance. The Tarpon also featured polished 13-inch aluminum wheels. Production Ramblers rode on <b>ordinary</b> <b>steel</b> 14-inch versions, so the smaller wheels made the car lower.

50|$|Common {{grades of}} Invar have a {{coefficient}} of thermal expansion (denoted α, and measured between 20 °C and 100 °C) of about 1.2 × 10−6 K−1 (1.2 ppm/°C), while <b>ordinary</b> <b>steels</b> have values of around 11-15 ppm. Extra-pure grades (<0.1% Co) can readily produce values {{as low as}} 0.62-0.65 ppm/°C. Some formulations display negative thermal expansion (NTE) characteristics. Though it displays high dimensional stability over a range of temperatures, it does have a propensity to creep.|$|R
50|$|The largest use of Elinvar was {{in balance}} springs for {{mechanical}} watches and chronometers. A {{major cause of}} inaccuracy in watches and clocks was that <b>ordinary</b> <b>steels</b> used in springs lost elasticity slightly as the temperature increased, so the balance wheel would oscillate more slowly back and forth, and the clock would lose time. Chronometers and precision watches required complex temperature-compensated balance wheels for accurate timekeeping. Springs made of Elinvar, and other low temperature coefficient alloys such as Nivarox that followed, were not affected by temperature, so they made the temperature-compensated balance wheel obsolete.|$|R

50|$|Permalloy is a {{nickel-iron}} magnetic alloy, {{with about}} 80% nickel and 20% iron content. Invented in 1914 by physicist Gustav Elmen at Bell Telephone Laboratories, it is notable for its very high magnetic permeability, {{which makes it}} useful as a magnetic core material in electrical and electronic equipment, and also in magnetic shielding to block magnetic fields.

50|$|Ferrous materials, {{including}} steel, may {{be somewhat}} protected by promoting oxidation ("rust") and then converting the oxidation to a metalophosphate by using phosphoric acid and further protected by surface coating.

5000|$|Mu-metal {{typically}} has {{relative permeability}} values of 80,000-100,000 compared to several thousand for <b>ordinary</b> <b>steel.</b> It is a [...] "soft" [...] magnetic material; it has low magnetic anisotropy and magnetostriction, {{giving it a}} low coercivity so that it saturates at low magnetic fields.
