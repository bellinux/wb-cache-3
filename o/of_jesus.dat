5|$|The four {{canonical}} gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) are {{the foremost}} {{sources for the}} life and message <b>of</b> <b>Jesus.</b> However, {{other parts of the}} New Testament also include references to key episodes in his life, such as the Last Supper in 1 Corinthians 11:23. Acts of the Apostles (Acts 10:37–38 and Acts 19) refers to the early ministry <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> and its anticipation by John the Baptist. Acts 1:1–11 says more about the Ascension <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> (also mentioned in 1 Timothy 3:16) than the canonical gospels do. In the undisputed Pauline letters, which were written earlier than the gospels, the words or instructions <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> are cited several times (1 Corinthians 7:10–11, 9:14, 11:23–25, 2 Corinthians 12:9).|$|E

Images of a number of saints have also been preserved, including these of the patron saint Demetrius, Saint George riding a white horse, Saint Achillius of Larissa and Saint Nicholas.|$|E

50|$|According to the Gospel of Barnabas, a 16th-century work, Barnabas was one <b>of</b> <b>Jesus's</b> disciples.

5|$|In Catholicism, {{there has}} been a long {{tradition}} of veneration of the heart, stemming from worship of the wounds <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ which gained prominence from the mid sixteenth century. This tradition influenced the development of the medieval Christian devotion to the Sacred Heart <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> and the parallel worship of Immaculate Heart of Mary, made popular by John Eudes.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the authors}} of the New Testament showed little {{interest}} in an absolute chronology <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age. As stated in , the gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life <b>of</b> <b>Jesus.</b> The accounts were primarily written as theological documents in the context of early Christianity, with timelines as a secondary consideration. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the Gospels devote about one third of their text to the last week of the life <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> in Jerusalem, referred to as the Passion. Although the gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, it is possible to draw from them a general picture of the life story <b>of</b> <b>Jesus.</b>|$|E

5|$|Matthew and Luke each {{describe}} Jesus' nativity (or birth), {{especially that}} Jesus was born by a virgin Mary in Bethlehem in fulfillment of prophecy. Luke's account emphasizes events {{before the birth}} <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> and centers on Mary, while Matthew's mostly covers those after the birth and centers on Joseph. Both accounts state that Jesus was born to Joseph and Mary, his betrothed, in Bethlehem, and both support {{the doctrine of the}} virgin birth <b>of</b> <b>Jesus,</b> according to which Jesus was miraculously conceived by the Holy Spirit in Mary's womb when she was still a virgin.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{research}} on the historical Jesus has not led to a unified picture of the historical figure, {{partly because of the}} variety of academic traditions represented by the scholars.

The portraits <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> constructed in these quests often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospels.|$|E

5|$|Sanders {{says that}} the genealogies <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> are based not on {{historical}} information but on the authors' desire to show that Jesus was the universal Jewish savior. In any event, once {{the doctrine of the}} virgin birth <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> became established, that tradition superseded the earlier tradition that he was descended from David through Joseph. Luke reports that Jesus was a blood relation of John the Baptist, but scholars generally consider this connection to be invented.|$|E
