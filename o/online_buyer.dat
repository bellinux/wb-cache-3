Although researchers {{from a variety of}} business disciplines have made significant progress over the past few years, the scope of these studies is rather broad, the studies appear relatively fragmented and no unifying theoretical model is found in this research area. In view of this, we provide review of the literature and propose a research framework for designing BBI which is essentially based on online buying behaviour of Indian buyer. The propose research is based on four key building blocks (motivation, attitude, personality and trust) so as to analyze the <b>online</b> <b>buyer</b> behaviour in a systematic way. This proposed framework provides us with a cohesive view of <b>online</b> <b>buyer</b> behaviour which is a backbone of BBI decision support system in online retail sector.

Therefore, examining online sellers' website quality and online buyers' purchase intention is crucial.

In B 2 C market, E-marketers need to know web-based factors influencing online buying {{in order to develop}} marketing strategies and programs to retain existing <b>online</b> <b>buyers</b> and to convert potential customers into active one. Review of previous studies related to web-based factors for online purchasing among young consumers in Malaysia has point out that the conceptualization and empirical validation of the online purchasing behavior of ICT literate buyershas not been addressed. Therefore, this paper attempted to (i) determine web-based factors affecting online purchasing behavior of Malaysia's young consumers, and (ii) identify whether type of <b>online</b> <b>buyers</b> - Trial, Occasional, Frequent and Regular Buyers - perceived various website factors differently. A conceptual framework of 24 items of five factors - website design, fulfillment/reliability, customer service, privacy/security and information quality - was constructed to determine web-based factors affecting online purchasing of young consumers, who are also regarded as ICT literate consumers. 310 questionnaires were gathered using a stratified random sampling method from ICT students in a public university in Malaysia. Result of Exploratory factor analysis showed that five web-based factors influencing online purchasing of young consumers are Information Quality, Quality of Customer Service, Website Design, Web Efficiency and Personalization, and Privacy/Security. The result of Multiple Regression Analysis indicated that Information Quality, Web Efficiency and Personalization, and Privacy/Security significantly and positively affect online purchase behavior of this group of consumers. The result of ANOVA revealed that the four types of young <b>online</b> <b>buyers</b> - trial, occasional, frequent and regular <b>online</b> <b>buyers</b> - perceived all items of website factors differently, which implies that e-marketers should focus on specific promotional mix programs to attract different types of <b>online</b> <b>buyers.</b> The results provide a usable model for measuring web-based factors influencing online purchasing in B 2 C market, as well as for e-marketers to tailor their marketing efforts to assuage young online consumers' anxiety with respect to online purchasing...|$|R

The {{results of an}} <b>online</b> <b>buyer</b> survey which has been conducted to investigate the impact of multi-channel retailing (i. e. the use of several retail channels by one retail company) on consumer behaviour show that the frequently {{expressed concern that the}} application of multi-channel systems in retailing would be associated with cannibalization effects, has proven unfounded. Indeed, the appropriate degree of similarity, consistency, integration and agreement achieves the exact opposite. Different channels create different advantages for consumers. Therefore the total benefit an enterprise which has a multi-channel system can offer to its consumers is larger, the greater the number of available channels. The use of multi-channel systems is associated with additional purchases in the different channels. Such systems are thus superior to those offering only one sales channel to their customers. Furthermore, multi-channel systems with integrated channels are superior to those in which the channels are essentially autonomous and independent of one another. In integrated systems, consumers can achieve synergy effects in the use of sales-channel systems. Accordingly, when appropriately formulated, multi-channel systems in retailing impact positively on consumers. They use the channels more frequently, buy more from them and there is a positive customer-loyalty impact. Multi-channel systems are strategic options for achieving customer loyalty, exploiting customer potential and for winning new customers. They are thus well suited for approaching differing and varied target groups...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} conversion behavior (i. e., converting store visits into purchases) that predicts each customer's probability of purchasing based on an observed history of visits and purchases. We offer an individual-level probability model that allows for different forms of customer heterogeneity in a very flexible manner. Specifically, we decompose an individual's conversion behavior into two components: one for accumulating visit effects and another for purchasing threshold effects. Each component is allowed to vary across households as well as over time. Visit effects capture the notion that store visits can play different roles in the purchasing process. For example, some visits are motivated by planned purchases, while others are associated with hedonic browsing (akin to window shopping); our model is able to accommodate these (and several other) types of visit-purchase relationships in a logical, parsimonious manner. The purchasing threshold captures the psychological resistance to online purchasing that may grow or shrink as a customer gains more experience with the purchasing process at a given website. We test {{different versions of the}} model that vary in the complexity of these two key components and also compare our general framework with popular alternatives such as logistic regression. We find that the proposed model offers excellent statistical properties, including its performance in a holdout validation sample, and also provides useful managerial diagnostics about the patterns underlying <b>online</b> <b>buyer</b> behavior. stochastic models, e-commerce, online purchasing conversion, buyer behavior...|$|E

We use baseball cards as an example to address (1) whether consumers fully understand the riskof online trading, (2) the extent to which consumers employ seller reputation and professional grading to alleviate the riskthey are exposed to, and (3) the impact of online trading on the retail market and supporting industries. An experiment is carried out to obtain actual baseball cards from both online and retail markets whose quality is then professionally graded and compared to the prices paid by <b>online</b> <b>buyers</b> for goods with similar claims. Our findings indicate that some uninformed <b>online</b> <b>buyers</b> are misled by non-credible claims of quality; they pay higher prices but do not receive better quality and in fact are defrauded more often.

Data on structural changes in the baseball card industry suggest the problems stemming from buyer misconception may have far-reaching consequences, extending beyond the immediate losses of defrauded consumers to influencing producer and supply decisions.
