40|$|The current {{research}} investigated cultural differences in emotional intelligence among top <b>officers</b> <b>on</b> board vessels of multicultural maritime companies. We found that Southeast Asian officers {{scored higher than}} European <b>officers</b> <b>on</b> the total Emotional Intelligence scale. When separating the EQ scale in its facets, higher scores for Asian <b>officers</b> were found <b>on</b> “Utilization of emotions”, “Handling relationships”, and on “Self-control”. Another finding was that Chief officers/ Second engineers scored higher than Masters/Chief <b>Officers</b> <b>on</b> “Self-control”. Finally, we found a negative correlation between age and scores on the facet of “Self-control”. These crosscultural differences may have implications for interpersonal relations and ship management...|$|R
