Creation is taken up first not because the subject has chronological priority but rather to ground basic religious beliefs in {{the very nature of}} things. And I would argue that their power is quite independent of the scientific context in which they were first enunciated.|$|E

6000|$|I {{dwell on}} these trivialities because every year {{thousands}} of British boys enter these mills which grind exceeding small, and because these boys constitute in after life {{the great majority}} of the official, military, academic, professional, and a considerable proportion of the business classes of Great Britain. They become the Englishmen who say: [...] "Really!" [...] and they are {{for the most part the}} Englishmen who travel and reach America. The great defence I have always heard put up for <b>our</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> is that they form character. As oatmeal is supposed to form bone in the bodies of Scotsmen, so <b>our</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> are supposed to form good, sound moral fibre in British boys. And there is much in this plea. The life does make boys enduring, self-reliant, good-tempered and honourable, but it most carefully endeavours to destroy all original sin of individuality, spontaneity, and engaging freakishness. It implants, moreover, in {{the great majority of}} those who have lived it the mental attitude of that swell, who when asked where he went for his hats, replied: [...] "Blank's, of course.

60|$|But if I {{regard it}} closely, a curious {{reflection}} arises. I suppose that, fifteen hundred years ago, {{the child of}} any well-to-do Roman citizen was taught just these same things; reading and writing in his own, and, perhaps, the Greek tongue; the elements of mathematics; and the religion, morality, history, and geography current in his time. Furthermore, I do not think I err in affirming that, if such a Christian Roman boy, who had finished his education, could be transplanted into one of <b>our</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools,</b> and pass through its course of instruction, he would not meet with a single unfamiliar line of thought; amidst all the new facts {{he would have to}} learn, not one would suggest a different mode of regarding the universe from that current in his own time.|$|E
60|$|Now if one may compare {{very small}} things with very great, one {{may say that}} the English aristocratic schools can claim {{something}} of {{the same sort of}} success and solid splendor as the French democratic politics. At least they can claim the same sort of superiority over the distracted and fumbling attempts of modern England to establish democratic education. Such success as has attended the public schoolboy throughout the Empire, a success exaggerated indeed by himself, but still positive and a fact of a certain indisputable shape and size, has been due to the central and supreme circumstance that the managers of <b>our</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> did know what sort of boy they liked.
