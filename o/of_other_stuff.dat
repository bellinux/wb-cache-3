500|$|However, Trio members never {{claimed to}} be folksingers and were never {{comfortable}} with the label. The liner notes for the group's first album featured a quotation from Dave Guard asserting that [...] "We are not folksingers in the accepted sense of the word." [...] Guard later told journalist Richard Hadlock in Down Beat magazine: [...] "We are not students of folk music; the basic thing for us is honest and worthwhile songs that people can pick up and become involved in." [...] Nick Reynolds added in the same article: [...] "We don't collect old songs {{in the sense that}} the academic cats do... We get new tunes to look over every day. Each one of us has his ears open constantly to new material or old stuff that's good." [...] Bob Shane remarked years later: [...] "To call the Kingston Trio folksingers was kind of stupid in the first place. We never called ourselves folksingers... We did folk-oriented material, but we did it amid all kinds <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>stuff.</b> But they didn't know what to call us with our instruments, so Capitol Records called us folksingers and gave us credit for starting this whole boom." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band has}} stated that the album's tenth track, [...] "Wretches and Kings", pays homage to the hip-hop group Public Enemy. Speaking to NME about the song's {{reference}} to Public Enemy, Shinoda said, [...] "There is a homage to Chuck D on there. It's probably the most hip-hop song on the record {{and one of the}} most aggressive...Public Enemy were very three-dimensional with their records because although they seemed political, there was a whole lot <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>stuff</b> going on in there too. It made me think how three-dimensional I wanted our record to be without imitating them of course, and show where we were at creatively." [...] Ian Winwood of Kerrang! noted that [...] "Wretches and Kings" [...] references the Public Enemy song [...] "Fight the Power" [...] and compared the album's content to Public Enemy's third studio album, Fear of a Black Planet. Chuck D later provided vocals on a remix by HavocNdeeD. The fifth track [...] "When They Come for Me" [...] references , the seventh studio album by hip hop artist Jay-Z, with whom the band collaborated on the 2004 EP Collision Course. The album includes samples of notable speeches by American political figures, including Martin Luther King, Jr., J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Mario Savio.|$|E
