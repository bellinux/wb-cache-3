Early reports indicated Hicks would remain a minority owner {{with the club}} and would serve on the board in a non-voting honorary position.

60|$|Across {{the narrow}} table the two men's glances met--Hogan's full {{of concern and}} pity, Crispin's charged with amazement and horror. A little while they sat thus, then Crispin rose slowly to his feet, and with steps {{uncertain}} as a drunkard's he crossed to the window. He pushed it open, and let the icy wind upon his face and head, unconscious of its sting. Moments passed, during which the knight went <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of his turbulent life since his first meeting at Perth with Kenneth Stewart. He recalled how strangely and unaccountably he had been drawn to the boy when first he beheld him in the castle yard, and how, owing to a feeling for which he could not account, since the lad's character had little that might commend him to such a man as Crispin, he had contrived that Kenneth should serve in his company.|$|E
