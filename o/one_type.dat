40|$|Consider a {{heterogeneous}} agent matching {{model in which}} the payoff of each matched individual is a fixed function of both partners' types. In a 1973 article, Becker showed that assortative matching arises in a frictionless setting simply if everyone prefers higher partners. This paper shows that if finding partners requires time-consuming search and individuals are impatient, then productive interaction matters. Matching is positively assortative—higher types match with higher sets of types—when the proportionate gains from having better partners rise in <b>one's</b> <b>type.</b> With multiplicatively separable payoffs, these proportionate gains are constant in <b>one's</b> <b>type,</b> and "block segregation" arises, a common finding of the literature. ...|$|R

5|$|There {{are three}} types of {{coloured}} insect, and {{three types of}} pesticide, which will either kill, stun, or {{have no effect on}} the insects. The player can only carry <b>one</b> <b>type</b> of pesticide at a time; during {{the early stages of the}} game the lethal pesticide can be carried at all times, but later stages have more than <b>one</b> <b>type</b> of insect on screen at once, making the choice of pesticide more tactical.|$|E
5|$|When {{war broke}} out in 1941, Voroshilov was not {{equipped}} with any radars, but she received a number of British Lend-Lease radars by 1944. <b>One</b> <b>Type</b> 284 and two Type 285 radars were used for main battery fire control. <b>One</b> <b>Type</b> 291 was used for air search, while anti-aircraft fire control was provided by two Type 282 radars.|$|E
5|$|Although the edibility of S.amygdalinus is {{not known}} with certainty, {{authorities}} often recommend to avoid consuming blue-staining, red-pored boletes, as several are poisonous. The species was implicated in one group of poisonings in California in 1996–97, {{but because of the}} nature of the symptoms experienced, there was probably more than <b>one</b> <b>type</b> of mushroom consumed.|$|E
5|$|Barycentric {{subdivision}} is {{an example}} of a subdivision rule with <b>one</b> edge <b>type</b> (that gets subdivided into two edges) and <b>one</b> tile <b>type</b> (a triangle that gets subdivided into 6 smaller triangles).

50|$|NOTE: To {{avoid this}} bug in the CEA-708 {{standard}} some encoders encode captions only on <b>one</b> frame <b>type,</b> such as only P frames, or only I frames, since if only <b>one</b> frame <b>type</b> is used, the frame display and frame encoded order are the same.|$|R
5|$|Antibody genes also re-organize in {{a process}} called class {{switching}} that changes the <b>one</b> <b>type</b> of heavy chain Fc fragment to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen-specific variable region. This allows a single antibody {{to be used by}} different types of Fc receptors, expressed on different parts of the immune system.|$|E
5|$|Aviation {{interests}} {{have their own}} set of weather maps. <b>One</b> <b>type</b> of map shows where VFR (visual flight rules) are in effect and where IFR (instrument flight rules) are in effect. Weather depiction plots show ceiling height (level where {{at least half the}} sky is covered with clouds) in hundreds of feet, present weather, and cloud cover. Icing maps depict areas where icing can be a hazard for flying. Aviation-related maps also show areas of turbulence.|$|E
5|$|Dengue {{is spread}} by {{several species of}} {{mosquito}} of the Aedes type, principally A. aegypti. The virus has five different types; infection with <b>one</b> <b>type</b> usually gives lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent infection with a different type {{increases the risk of}} severe complications. A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA.|$|E

5|$|<b>One</b> <b>type</b> of coin for Beonna has no named moneyer and depicts an {{interlace}} motif on its reverse. A {{specimen of}} this type (now lost) was found at Dorestad, which was during Beonna's time an important trading centre: these coins resemble Frankish or Frisian deniers that were issued from the Maastricht area during this period.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>type</b> of inter-cellular {{communication}} by {{a molecular}} signal is called quorum sensing, which serves {{the purpose of}} determining {{whether there is a}} local population density that is sufficiently high that it is productive to invest in processes that are only successful if large numbers of similar organisms behave similarly, as in excreting digestive enzymes or emitting light.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>type</b> of {{piezoelectric}} transducer is the Langevin type, {{named after a}} transducer used by Paul Langevin in early sonar research. This is good for longitudinal modes of vibration. It {{can also be used}} on resonators with other modes of vibration if the motion can be mechanically converted into a longitudinal motion. The transducer consists of a layer of piezoelectric material sandwiched transversally into a coupling rod or resonator.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the tight}} control of enzyme {{activity}} {{is essential for}} homeostasis, any malfunction (mutation, overproduction, underproduction or deletion) of a single critical enzyme {{can lead to a}} genetic disease. The malfunction of just <b>one</b> <b>type</b> of enzyme out of the thousands of types present in the human body can be fatal. An example of a fatal genetic disease due to enzyme insufficiency is Tay-Sachs disease, in which patients lack the enzyme hexosaminidase.|$|E
5|$|Sponges {{constitute}} the phylum Porifera, {{and have been}} defined as sessile metazoans (multicelled immobile animals) that have water intake and outlet openings connected by chambers lined with choanocytes, cells with whip-like flagella. However, a few carnivorous sponges have lost these water flow systems and the choanocytes. All known living sponges can remold their bodies, as most types of their cells can move within their bodies and a few can change from <b>one</b> <b>type</b> to another.|$|E
5|$|The campaign's {{ultimate}} limitation was {{the poor}} formulation of military strategy. The types of targets selected from one operation {{to the next}} differed radically and no sustained pressure was put on any <b>one</b> <b>type</b> of British target. The Luftwaffes strategy became increasingly aimless. Disputes among the OKL staff revolved more around tactics than strategy. This method condemned the offensive over Britain to failure before it had begun.|$|E
