40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether investors {{care more}} about trading their exact quantity demands at some times than at others. Using a new data set of foreign-exchange transactions, I find that customers trade more precise quantities at quarter-end, as evidenced by less trade-size clustering. Customers trade more <b>odd</b> <b>lots</b> and fewer round lots, {{while the number of}} trades and total volume are not significantly changed. I also find that the price impact of order flow is greater when customers {{care more about}} trading precise quantities. This work sheds new light on trade-size clustering and offers a potential explanation for time-series and cross-sectional variations in common liquidity measures...|$|R

According to a blog post by Max Seybold, the device's specs in Cherrypal's web store are kept intentionally vague, because the Africa is not built to a set design. Instead, Cherrypal either purchases pre-made netbook systems or buys <b>odd</b> <b>lots</b> of whatever inexpensive components are available and builds netbooks out of these. It then rebrands these netbooks as Africas. The $99 computer was named Africa in honor of PAAJAF, a humanitarian services group based in Ghana, West-Africa. Seybold states that the resulting device will at a minimum meet the specs listed on the website, but could also exceed them. It could also end up having an ARM, MIPS, or x86-based CPU architecture depending on what chips are available.|$|R

5000|$|Pressman {{was born}} to a Jewish family, {{the son of an}} owner of a {{clothing}} store. He was one of seven children and was raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. In 1923, he purchased the lease and contents of a small clothing store at Seventh Avenue and 17th Street in Manhattan selling his wife's wedding ring to finance the transaction. As his store was located in a non-traditional retail area, Pressman purchased inventory at a discount at bankruptcies, auctions, and in <b>odd</b> <b>lots</b> including searching the newspapers for notices of death and divorce among the city’s elite. By buying name-brand goods at a discount, he was able to severely undercut the manufacturer's selling price and although {{he did not have the}} most desired styles, his working class customers preferred brand name products for low prices. His success incurred the wrath of the manufacturers who pressured local suppliers to limit sales to Pressman; Pressman circumvented their efforts and started to purchase excess inventory from independent retailers in the South where the local manufacturers had less influence.|$|R

5000|$|Smith & Gray Company Building was an edifice {{which was}} erected in Brooklyn, New York in 1888. Designed by {{architect}} Peter J. Lauritzen, {{the building was}} eight stories tall.

60|$|One day a {{good fortune}} befell him, for he hit upon Lane's {{translation}} of The Thousand Nights and a Night. He was captured {{first by the}} illustrations, and {{then he began to}} read, to start with, the stories that dealt with magic, and then the others; and those he liked he read again and again. He could think of nothing else. He forgot the life about him. He had to be called two or three times before he would come to his dinner. Insensibly he formed the most delightful habit in the world, the habit of reading: he did not know that thus he was providing himself with a refuge from all the distress of life; he did not know either that he was creating for himself an unreal world which would make the real world of every day a source of bitter disappointment. Presently he began to read other things. His brain was precocious. His uncle and aunt, seeing that he occupied himself and neither worried nor made a noise, ceased to trouble themselves about him. Mr. Carey had so many books {{that he did not know}} them, and as he read little he forgot the <b>odd</b> <b>lots</b> he had bought at one time and another because they were cheap. Haphazard among the sermons and homilies, the travels, the lives of the Saints, the Fathers, the histories of the church, were old-fashioned novels; and these Philip at last discovered. He chose them by their titles, and the first he read was The Lancashire Witches, and then he read The Admirable Crichton, and then many more. Whenever he started a book with two solitary travellers riding along the brink of a desperate ravine he knew he was safe.|$|R

50|$|Land for the {{original}} City Hall was donated {{to the city of}} Champaign in 1888 by David Bailey, who was a charter founder of the First National Bank of Champaign.

Bailey also insisted that the city must develop a building worth no less than $5,000 within a year of his donation. The city, in turn, built a multi-purpose structure that housed the Police and Fire Departments, an auditorium, a library, and a chamber and meeting room for the City Council.|$|R
