50|$|Overcast {{stitches}} may be reversible, as {{when they}} are used to join together crochet block pieces of afghan blankets. There are several different kinds of overcast stitches. A straight <b>overcast</b> <b>stitch</b> is used for finishing edges in eyelets and cutwork fabric. A blanket stitch, used to finish edges of wool blankets, is another common <b>overcast</b> <b>stitch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The hand <b>overcast</b> <b>stitch</b> {{involves}} small diagonal stitches evenly spaced out enclosing {{the fabric}} raw edge.To create an <b>overcast</b> <b>stitch</b> by sewing machine, {{we can use}} an overcast foot, though a regular foot also can be used. The overcast foot has an edge guide which helps the fabric to feed evenly along the edge and a bar in the middle that controls the stitch and makes it lay nice and flat.|$|E
5000|$|In embroidery, an <b>overcast</b> <b>stitch</b> is {{a raised}} line stitch used on even-weave fabrics. It is {{commonly}} used for outlining designs. There are two methods of creating an embroidered <b>overcast</b> <b>stitch.</b> In one method, a line is stitched to create padding, then another thread covers the padding stitches in small stitches {{at right angles to}} the padding stitches. The other method is called detached overcast stitching, and involves two alternating padding stitches that pick up the fabric, followed by overcast stitches that cover the padding stitches without picking up the fabric.|$|E
40|$|Fragment of yellowed woven wool fabric with a rolled hem {{along one}} edge {{and part of}} another. There are two weftwise rows of <b>overcast</b> <b>stitching</b> that attach {{fragments}} of the same fabric. There are also several random stitches near one edge.; Somewhat dirty with small amount of encrusted mud. Several interior holes. One edge tear. Some edge fraying...|$|R
40|$|Reconstructed Poncho, Inca style, Late Horizon. (1476 AD - 1534 AD) Camelid. Discontinuous weft with weft {{interlock}} joins and complementary weft. Neck opening {{reinforced with}} (whipping) <b>overcast</b> <b>stitches</b> in white camelid. Warp: Mixed brown and white. Weft: yellow, blue green, and red. All 2 -ply S. [CAS 389 - 2364] Length = 154. 8 cm, Width = 73 cm...|$|R
40|$|Fragment {{of brown}} woven wool fabric. Part of one edge has been folded over but no {{stitches}} are visible, however, the fabric is pulled in tightly {{in two places}} which could indicate <b>overcast</b> <b>stitches</b> that passed around the outside edge. Several fibers, 1 - 1. 5 cm long, adhere to the surface {{at one end of}} the fold. These fibers may be flax.; Fairly clean, but worn. Several interior holes and tears along the edges...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} styles of hems of varying complexities. The most common hem folds up a cut edge, folds it up again, and then sew it down. The style of hemming thus completely encloses the cut edge in cloth, so that it cannot unravel. Other hem styles use fewer folds. One of the simplest hems encloses the edge of cloth with a stitch without any folds at all, using a method called an <b>overcast</b> <b>stitch,</b> although an <b>overcast</b> <b>stitch</b> {{may be used to}} finish a folded [...] "plain hem" [...] as well.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Overcast</b> <b>stitch</b> is one {{of several}} types of sewing stitches, this type being used on a raw, or unfinished, seam or edge. The purpose is to prevent {{unraveling}} of the fabric.|$|E
40|$|Fragment of undyed woven linen fabric with a {{discontinuous}} pick of red {{wool and}} a red outline of a cross created with weft-wrapping. There are black <b>overcast</b> <b>stitches</b> along one edge and the same yarn was used to repair a tear. A small piece of a finer linen fabric was sewed to one side with warps at right angles.; Dirty and worn. There are several small interior holes. A long edge tear was repaired...|$|R
40|$|Fragment of yellow/gold woven wool fabric with a red/purple weft band running {{approximately}} {{across the}} center. The band is 1 cm wide. One edge has been folded over and sewn with <b>overcast</b> <b>stitches.</b> This {{may be a}} repair because these stitches attach another small piece that is connected to loose warps from the main fragment. The sewing yarns and another cord wrap around this small piece and the loose warps.; Dirty and very worn. Loose yarns around all four edges, some frayed. Edge tears...|$|R
40|$|Small {{fragment}} of pale brown woven wool fabric with a ribbed selvedge and {{a remnant of}} a red weft band 1. 5 cm from one end. There is 1. 5 cm of red band but {{since most of the}} weft along one side is missing, it is unknown if the band was wider originally. There are brown <b>overcast</b> <b>stitches</b> {{along the edge of the}} selvedge. The weft is unevenly spun; some thick, some thin.; Somewhat dirty, very worn. There are a few interior holes and edge tears. A section of weft, next to the red band, is missing...|$|R
5000|$|Broderie anglaise is {{characterized}} by patterns composed of round or oval holes, called eyelets, which are {{cut out of the}} fabric, then bound with <b>overcast</b> or buttonhole <b>stitches.</b> [...] The patterns, often depicting flowers, leaves, vines, or stems, are further delineated by simple embroidery stitches made on the surrounding material. Later broderie anglaise also featured small patterns worked in satin stitch.|$|R
50|$|A notable {{developer}} {{of the industry}} in Scotland was Mrs Jamieson, the wife of an Ayrshire cotton agent. Seeing a philanthropic opportunity, she set out to teach local farmers' wives and daughters the trade, focusing on firm satin <b>stitch,</b> <b>overcast</b> fillings, and fine lace stitches in cut-out spaces. The designs were drawn up by professional draughtsmen in Glasgow before being sent out to be embroidered by outworkers. They were then bleached, made up, boxed and widely marketed, proving especially popular in North America.|$|R
5000|$|Reticella lace {{is a form}} of {{embroidery}} {{in which}} typical techniques of needlelace are used to embellish drawn thread work. It was first used in 16th century Italy. Needlelace evolved from this when the lacemakers realized that they can do the same things without any supporting fabric. High quality reticella is done with thread almost as thin as sewing silk. Ruskin lace is in fact a near-modern form of it. Warp and weft threads are removed, and the remaining threads are <b>overcast</b> with buttonhole <b>stitches,</b> as in needlelace.|$|R
40|$|Fragment of a woven wool {{tapestry}} {{with brown}} warp and red, black, purple, blue, green/blue, olive green, white and yellow weft. A row of eight multi-colored birds, outlined in black, crosses {{the center of}} the fragment. Above and below the birds there are red bands with a row of small black diamonds outlined in white. There is a border of warp loops enclosing three white yarns (two are zzS, the third is two zzS yarns that have been Z-twisted together) along the edge below the birds. There are six picks of yellow weft between the red bands and the border. Along the opposite edge there is a section with a very crude finish of <b>overcast</b> white <b>stitches</b> which enclose two white yarns across the edge. The balance of this edge is unfinished with loose warps that are up to 3 cm long. The two warp-wise edges have plain selvedges. The warp and most of the weft yarns are plied.; Fairly clean with bright colors. There is some wear from abrasion. Some of the tapestry slits have stretched into holes. Some of the black yarn outlining the birds has deteriorated...|$|R
