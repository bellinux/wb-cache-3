5|$|McCain {{entered the}} race for the Republican {{nomination}} for President in 2000, but he lost a heated primary season contest to George W. Bush of Texas. He secured the nomination in 2008 after coming back from early reversals, but was defeated by Democratic nominee Barack Obama in the general election, losing by a 365â€“173 electoral college margin. He subsequently adopted more orthodox conservative stances and attitudes and largely opposed actions of the Obama administration, especially in regard to foreign policy matters. By 2013, however, he had become a key figure in the Senate for negotiating deals on certain issues in an otherwise partisan environment. In 2015, McCain became chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> Committee.|$|E

25|$|The December 27 {{assassination}} of former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto drew responses {{from all of}} the major candidates. McCain, a longtime member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> Committee, called attention to his foreign policy experience, as well as his personal interaction with Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf. He also drew a contrast with his main Republican rivals, who did not have experience in foreign policy matters. Many observers saw McCain as the candidate most likely to benefit from a heightened focus on international events.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{entering}} the Senate in 1987, McCain kept a low profile. [...] He {{became a member}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> Committee, with which he had formerly done his Navy liaison work; he was also given positions on the Commerce Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee. [...] For {{his first two years}} in the Senate, he sat at the Candy desk.|$|E
500|$|While {{control of}} the House of Representatives {{went over to the}} Republicans in the 112th Congress, the Senate stayed Democratic and McCain {{continued}} to be the ranking member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> Committee. As the Arab Spring took center stage, McCain urged that the embattled Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, step down and thought the U.S. should push for democratic reforms in the region despite the associated risks of religious extremists gaining power. McCain was an especially vocal supporter of the 2011 military intervention in Libya. In April of that year he visited the Anti-Gaddafi forces and National Transitional Council in Benghazi, the highest-ranking American to do so, and said that the rebel forces were [...] "my heroes". In June, he joined with Senator Kerry in offering a resolution that would have authorized the military intervention, and said: [...] "The administration's disregard for the elected representatives of the American people on this matter has been troubling and counterproductive." [...] In August, McCain voted for the Budget Control Act of 2011 that resolved the U.S. debt ceiling crisis. In November, McCain and Senator Carl Levin were leaders in efforts to codify in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 that terrorism suspects, no matter where captured, could be detained by the U.S. military and its tribunal system; following objections by civil libertarians, some Democrats, and the White House, McCain and Levin agreed to language making it clear that the bill would not pertain to U.S. citizens.|$|E
500|$|As {{his tenure}} with VA-174 was ending, McCain was {{assigned}} to a low-profile desk job within the Naval Air Systems Command. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral James L. Holloway III thought this assignment a waste of McCain's social talents, and instead in July 1977 McCain {{was appointed to the}} Senate Liaison Office within the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs (an assignment Jack McCain had once held). The office's role mostly consisted of providing constituent service and acting as a facilitator among legislators, the Department of Defense, and lobbyists. McCain later said the liaison job represented [...] " [...] real entry into the world of politics and the beginning of my second career as a public servant". McCain's lively personality and knowledge of military matters made his post in the Russell Senate Office Building a popular gathering spot for senators and staff. He also frequently escorted congressional delegations on overseas trips, where he arranged entertaining side escapades. McCain was influenced by senators of both parties, and formed an especially strong bond with John Tower of Texas, the ranking member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> Committee. During 1978 and 1979, McCain played a key behind-the-scenes role in gaining congressional funding for a new supercarrier against the wishes of the Carter administration and Navy Secretary W. Graham Claytor Jr. In August 1979, McCain was promoted to naval captain, and became Director of the Senate Liaison Office. [...] During McCain's time there, the Senate Liaison Office enjoyed one of its few periods of high influence.|$|E
50|$|Following <b>the</b> 2014 <b>Senate</b> {{elections}} {{that saw the}} Republicans retake the majority, McCain has been predicted to become <b>the</b> new Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Committee on <b>Armed</b> Services.|$|R

[...] In April 2015, Kaine reiterated his opposition to the moratorium on offshore drilling. In March 2016, Kaine signaled that his position was softening, saying he was [...] "particularly struck by the material objections of the Department of Defense to the incompatibility of drilling with naval operations off Virginiaâ€™s coast... I have participated in this debate for over a decade as a governor and member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> Committee. The DOD has been relatively quiet during this public debate and has never shared their objections with me before." [...] By August 2016, Kaine stated his support for a ban on offshore drilling, bringing his position in line with that of Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration.|$|E

5000|$|During the Obama administration, Congress {{has sought}} to clarify <b>the</b> {{organization}} <b>of</b> OSD, and {{has worked with the}} Department to move toward a standardization of official naming conventions. Many Defense officials, including <b>the</b> Deputy Secretary <b>of</b> Defense (DEPSECDEF), all five Under Secretaries of Defense (USDs), and all Assistant Secretaries of Defense (ASDs), as well as any officials specifically designated in U.S. Code have historically been considered Presidentially-Appointed, Senate-Confirmed (PAS) officials, in that <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> must provide [...] "advice and consent" [...] for each individual before he or she can operate in an official capacity. In a March 2009 letter, Senator Carl Levin, Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Armed</b> Service Committee, wrote that the Department was apparently exercising the authority to appoint other significant officials - termed Deputy Under Secretaries of Defense (DUSDs) - [...] "without statutory authorization, without limitation, and without Senate confirmation." [...] Levin was [...] "concerned that <b>the</b> proliferation <b>of</b> DUSDs at multiple levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization could muddy lines of authority and may not be in <b>the</b> best interest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Defense."
