25|$|Pentacene is a {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbon}} consisting of five linearly-fused benzene rings. This highly conjugated compound is an <b>organic</b> <b>semiconductor.</b> The compound generates excitons upon absorption of ultra-violet (UV) or visible light; this makes it very sensitive to oxidation. For this reason, this compound, which is a purple powder, slowly degrades upon exposure to air and light.|$|E
25|$|Pentacene, as well {{as other}} organic conductors, is subject to rapid {{oxidation}} in air, which precludes commercialization. If the pentacene is preoxidized, the pentacene-quinone is a potential gate insulator, then the mobility can approach that of rubrene – the highest-mobility <b>organic</b> <b>semiconductor</b> – namely, 40cm2/(V·s).

The calculated results reveal that the increase of electric field and temperature can promote the relaxation effect in disordered <b>organic</b> <b>semiconductors,</b> while the increase of material disorder will weaken the relaxation.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} study of the interfacial electronic structure and thin film growth of two types of dipolar <b>organic</b> <b>semiconductors</b> on noble metals by employing a surface science approach, which underlines the critical role of surface electronic states in determining the interfacial electronic structure and self-assembly of <b>organic</b> <b>semiconductors.</b> I show that the electronic structure at organic/metal interfaces is complex and depends on important factors such as molecular adsorption configuration, surface/molecule coupling strength, reactivity of the substrate, molecular electrostatics, and local film structure. I demonstrate the fundamental capability of the image potential states and resonances in probing the local film environment, especially in systems consisting of inhomogeneous film structure. I also show {{that the presence of}} adsorbates on a surface allows one to investigate quantum mechanical interference effects otherwise not accessible on the bare surface. The dipolar <b>organic</b> <b>semiconductors</b> studied here are vanadyl naphthalocyanine (VONc) and chloroboron-subphthalocyanine (ClB-SubPc). The single crystals of gold and copper with hexagonal surface symmetry (111) were used to investigate the interfacial properties of VONc and ClB-SubPc, respectively. The fundamental understanding of self-assembly of large π-conjugated <b>organic</b> <b>semiconductors</b> on metals is a crucial step in controlling fabrication of supramolecular structures.
