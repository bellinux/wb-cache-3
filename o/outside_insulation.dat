5000|$|Tension {{membrane}} {{design has}} depended upon computers, {{and the increasing}} availability of powerful computers resulted in many developments being {{made in the last}} three decades of the 20th century. Weather-related deflations of some air-supported roofs led David Geiger to develop a modified type, the more rigid [...] "Cabledome", that incorporated Fuller's ideas of tensegrity and aspension rather than being air-supported. The pleated effect seen in some of these domes is the result of lower radial cables stretching between those forming trusses {{in order to keep the}} membrane in tension. The lightweight membrane system used consists of four layers: waterproof fiberglass on the <b>outside,</b> <b>insulation,</b> a vapor barrier, then an acoustic insulation layer. This is semitransparent enough to fulfill most daytime lighting needs beneath the dome. The first large span examples were two Seoul, South Korea, sports arenas built in 1986 for the Olympics, one 93 meters wide and the other 120 meters wide. The Georgia Dome, built in 1992 on an oval plan, uses instead a triangulated pattern in a system patented as the [...] "Tenstar Dome". The Millennium Dome was completed as the largest cable dome in the world with a diameter of 320 meters and uses a different system of membrane support, with cables extending down from the 12 masts that penetrate the membrane. The first cable dome to use rigid steel frame panels as roofing instead of a translucent membrane was begun for an athletic center in North Carolina in 1994.|$|E

This study analyzes indoor thermal environment and comfort on units of apartment buildings using calculation software ”THERB ” and compares three different kinds of heat insulation methods. Those are <b>outside</b> <b>insulation</b> on outside walls, inside insulation on outside walls and interior insulation. In terms of indoor thermal environment, <b>outside</b> <b>insulation</b> is the best to stabilize room temperature. In winter, room temperature on <b>outside</b> <b>insulation</b> after heating is higher than other and it is kept 3 - 5 degrees higher through all night.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} effect of {{insulation}} location on the heat transfer characteristics of building wall elements under steady periodic conditions and for different wall orientations. The thermal performance with an insulation layer placed {{on the inside of}} a wall structure is compared to that when the insulation layer is placed on the outside. A numerical model based on a finite-volume implicit procedure is used to determine the detailed and overall thermal characteristics during representative days for the months of July and January in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The validation of the numerical model against an analytical solution developed for a three-layered composite wall, accounting for the periodic variations in outdoor ambient temperature and solar insolation, shows excellent agreement. The results of model application reveal that the insulation layer location has a minimal effect on the mean daily cooling and heating loads, with a slight advantage for the <b>outside</b> <b>insulation</b> in summer and the inside insulation in winter. However, the <b>outside</b> <b>insulation</b> gives smaller amplitude of load fluctuation and smaller peak load in both summer and winter for all wall orientations, which could be advantageous in sizing air conditioning systems. Moreover, the <b>outside</b> <b>insulation</b> slightly increases the time lag in summer, compared to the inside insulation, and has practically the same effect on time lag in winter. The dynamic R-values are averaged over a full period and compared for different wall orientations, seasons and insulation locations. King Saud Universit...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to analyse the thermal {{characteristics}} of the void slab when the voids in the slab are used as air-conditioning heating and cooling ducts. A computer program has been developed for the successive calculation of the temperature variation of the void air from the inlet to outlet {{in the direction of}} void air flow. The program utilizes the two-dimensional finite element method (FEM) to compute transient heat conduction and temperature distribution of the cross section of the void slab. Using this computer prigram, the temperature variation of the void air for nine types of void slabs: uninsulated, upside of the slab insulated, the surface of the voids insulated, both upside of the slab and the surface of the voids insulated are all simulated under actual air-conditioning conditions for a commercial building. The following results are obtained based on the simulations. (1) When voids in an uninsulated roof slab are used as heating ducts, outlet air from the voids loses oveｒ 50 % of supplied sensible heat. However, when the surface of the voids are insulated with 30 mm thick foam polystyrene, heat loss is less than 10 % of the supplied heat.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of energy consumption and the thermal updating of existing buildings are strategies for decreasing atmospheric emissions and achieving the objectives {{set by the}} European Community to be met by 2020. The application of the European and national energy standards to the renovation of existing buildings, has produced improvements and added value to existing buildings by reducing their energy use. In this study {{the focus is on}} the thermal insulation applied to the inside or outside of the existing walls. In this context, a relatively unusual solution is analyzed: insulation with straw bales. In addition to the state of the art analysis of the characteristics of straw when used in construction, 16 cases of existing buildings insulated with straw bales are analyzed (14 outer insulation and 2 inner insulation). To understand the limits of this solutions and the elements used during the installation of the insulation it was used a technological analysis. The research presented in this study shows that the choice of this type of insulation is based upon the values of the inhabitants and their willingness to take part during the construction phases. This insulation is limited to buildings located in rural or semi-urban areas because the large thickness of the insulating layer (minimum 35 cm) limits the entry of the light into the rooms. From these considerations of the thickness of insulation applied to an existing wall, the hygrometric behavior of the insulation has been studied (calculation of the amount of water present in the insulating layer and in the total insulated wall and the calculation of Moisture Buffer Value), compared with hemp lime, on two types of enclosures (solid wall and cavity wall) through simulations with WUFI software. At the end of the simulation it was found that, although in some instances the total thickness of the insulated wall exceeded 90 cm, interstitial condensation didn't occur because the insulating materials used were breathable.

In the original application, the material layers of interest are thermal insulators in rocket motors and the heat comes from firing of the motors, but the principle of operation is equally applicable to other insulating materials subject to intense heating (e. g., ablative fire-retardant materials). Measuring the thickness decrement of propellant (in hybrid motors in particular) is another possible application of this transducer. Telemetry informs mission control of the propellant left after each burn. An eroding potentiometer could be characterized, more precisely, as an eroding two-wire resistor.

Limits to fuel traffic {{and the spread}} of green energy utilization are topics of interest for Syowa Base; this research considers the construction of a Syowa Base small-scale energy network (Syowa Base Micro-Grid: SBMG) for the purposes of reducing fuel consumption and increasing green energy utilization. The number of engine generators, the operation plan for the battery’s charge and discharge, and the introduction of an exhaust heat pump provided a means by which the load factor of the engine generator could be maintained high value from the fluctuations of green energy. This might be accomplished by modifying the main power supply of Syowa Base into a distributed power supply system rather than a conventional central power supply system.

40|$|The extreme {{sustainability}} {{in building}} {{can be considered}} as three different aspects: 1. The construction of the building. 2. The operation of the building during its lifetime 3. The building being torn down after service life. Under the assumption that not building is the best solution for sustainability, Point 1 can be easily dealt with by renovating existing buildings. This also brings the solution for point 3 : not tearing down buildings will eliminate pollution and waste disposal. These two solutions emphasize the need to focus on the most sustainable way of operating a building during its lifetime, reducing energy and water consumption and yet be a healthy place to live. A study of existing housing projects in the Netherlands that are now {{at the end of their}} service life reveals some significant issues. In general there is very limited thermal isolation or none at all, often only single pane windows and all spaces are generally small.

The main objective is to predict outlet temperature for the specific geometry of the heat exchanger studied here. Thus, the governing differential equations are derived for a counter-co-current flow arrangement of the three fluids.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} recent {{findings about}} the influence of oil-soaked mineral wool insulation material on the thermal heat loss of the insulated pipe. Thermal oil is a popular heat transfer fluid in high-temperature solar cooling applications using concentrating collectors, eg parabolic trough or linear Fresnel collectors. Leaks in thermal oil pipes or components thereof, eg. fittings, valves etc., result in thermal oil saturating the surrounding insulation layer. Mineral wool soaked with thermal oil has a higher heat conductivity than pure dry mineral wool. The influence of oil content on the heat loss has been investigated using a test stand with a heated section of insulated pipe. Simulated leaks have been applied and the temperature changes on the <b>outside</b> of the <b>insulation</b> have been observed. Different grades of saturation (0 %, 33 % and 50 %) have been investigated in the work presented, as well as different temperature levels (175 °C/ 347 °F and 250 °C/ 482 °F) of the thermal oil within the pipe. Thermal conductivity and heat loss are calculated and presented for these. The results show that an oil content of 33 % in mineral wool insulation increases thermal conductivity by a factor of 2. 5 to 3, compared to dry, oil-free insulation. An oil content of 50 % increases thermal conductivity by a factor of up to 3. 3. It was observed that the difference in thermal conductivity between 175 °C/ 347 °F and 250 °C/ 482 °F of bulk oil temperature inside the pipe is rather negligible, both at 33 % and 50 % oil content...|$|R
40|$|In {{the oil and}} gas industry, {{hydrocarbon}} {{process equipment}} was previously often thermally insulated by applying insulation directly to the metal surface. Fire protective <b>insulation</b> was applied <b>outside</b> the thermal <b>insulation.</b> In some cases, severe corrosion attacks were observed due to ingress of humidity and condensation at cold surfaces. Introducing a 25 mm air gap to prevent wet thermal insulation and metal wall contact is expected to solve the corrosion issues. This improved insulation methodology does, however, require more space that may not be available when refurbishing older process plants. Relocating structural elements would introduce much hot work, which should be minimized in live plants. It is also costly. The aim of the present study is therefore to develop a test concept for testing fire resistance of equipment protected with only air-gap and thermal insulation, i. e., without the fire-protective insulation. The present work demonstrates a conceptual methodology for small scale fire testing of mockups resembling a section of a distillation column. The mockups were exposed to a small-scale propane flame in a test configuration where the flow rate and the flame zone were optimized to give heat flux levels in the range 250 – 350 kW/m 2. Results are presented for a mockup resembling a 16 mm thick distillation column steel wall.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work {{was to develop a}} {{thermally}} enhanced frame wall that would reduce peak load air conditioning demand, shift a portion of the thermal load, and conserve energy in residential buildings. A frame wall containing macroencapsulated phase-change materials (PCMs), incorporated therein, was developed, constructed, and evaluated. This prototype wall is referred to as - phase-change frame wall (PCFW). A PCFW is a typical frame wall, consisting of <b>outside</b> siding, thermal <b>insulation,</b> studs, and inside sheathing, in which PCMs are incorporated, by macroencapsulation, to enhance the energy storage capabilities of the wall, and thus thermal mass of the building, via the high latent heat of fusion of the PCMs. The PCFW uses off-the-shelf components, which are herein integrated in an innovative way to produce better energy performance. Results from field testing show that the PCFW offers the potential to reduce wall peak heat flux by as much as 38 %. This value is dependent on climate, wall orientation, quantity of PCM, and wall insulation level. Over a period of days, the average wall peak heat flux reduction was approximately 15 % when PCFWs facing four cardinal directions (i. e., N, S, E, W) were evaluated when 10 % 1 concentration of PCM was used and approximately 9 % when 20 % PCM concentration was used. The average space-cooling load was reduced by approximately 8. 6 % when 10 % PCM was applied and 10. 8 % when 20 % was used. The level of fiberglass insulation in the PCFW was R- 11 (1. 94 m 2 K/W). Although frame wall technology was used as a structural vehicle for this project, the concept could also be applied in almost any building structure, including structural insulated panels, and concrete and masonry buildings. The application could also be extended to commercial buildings...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{insulation}} {{of building}} envelopes has improved over the years. This means that building envelope {{have become more}} susceptible to defects, with {{an increased risk of}} moisture damage. The criteria for energy consumption have become more rigorous, but the shift should not lead to moisture problems. New knowledge about timber and wooden constructions is required in order to better meet these criteria. The purpose of this thesis has been to examine moisture levels in timber and external wooden walls during the construction and usage phases, as well as provide recommendations for good moisture safety. The work is based on seven publications, listed in chronological order from the construction process, and covers timber stacks at sawmills, factory production of wall elements and roof trusses, transportation to the building site, assembly, as well as follow-up of finished houses and structures in the usage stage. Mainly three methods, field test, calculation and laboratory test, have been used for evaluation of moisture levels, temperature and mould growth. The overall conclusion is that dry wooden structures and timber is required, which means that several minor adjustments need to be made to the construction practices, construction methods, products, materials, designs and structures currently being used, in order to achieve good moisture safety. In southern Sweden, there is a significant risk for mould growth on wooden studs in well-insulated north-facing external walls that lack external thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>outside</b> the wooden studs. In northern Sweden this risk is significantly lower or there is no risk at all. A small amount of rain that does not create running or dripping water on timber materials and which can dry out the same day should not lead to a risk of mould growth. In general, however, precipitation and material exposed to rain pose a high risk of mould growth. There is a risk of mould growth on timber surfaces that are exposed to an outdoor air in southern Sweden for more than a month, but not at all in the mountain areas or northernmost Sweden. There also appears to be a major gap between product manufacturers, engineers and constructors with regard to ensuring overall functionality. For example, a large amount of products are not produced and tested to co-function or as part of a multi-component system in order to achieve an overall function, which means that not even the correct preconditions are generally available on the market in order to construct and assemble moisture safe...|$|R
40|$|Biological organisms have an {{incredible}} {{ability to adapt}} to almost any environment and the humans activities on earth have created many new habitats for different kinds of organisms. For example can certain organisms grow on rocks and vertical cliffs, and when humans started building houses with mineral based façades, some organisms found that these were new habitats to live on. Some of these expansions of habitats to our houses are not desirable for the us humans and are considered as “contaminations". Even if this contamination sometimes only is an aesthetically problem, some contamination is highly unwanted {{because it can be}} unhealthy for the inhabitants - for example the growth of moulds - or it can degrade the building materials it grows on -as for example wood-degrading fungi. For an organism to grow in a certain environment, different requirements on abiotic (physical and chemical) and biotic (biological) factors have to be fulfilled. Suitable conditions for growth of organisms on façades are certain ranges in temperature and a high moisture level (RH), but also the surface structure, nutrient availability, pH, cardinal direction etc. might be influencing. Different organisms have different demands on these factors and it is a complex interaction of these different factors that decides if an organism can grow in a certain environment. The last decades many houses in Sweden have been built with constructions of thin rendering on thermal insulation, a so called ETICS construction (External Thermal Insulation Construction System). This construction consist most often of a framework of wooden studs with thermal insulation in between, and gypsum boards or cement based boards on both sides. On the <b>outside</b> a thermal <b>insulation</b> layer is applied and the render is then applied directly on the outside of this thermal insulation layer. This is a an efficient and compact construction which is easy to produce. However, many of these constructions have experienced discolourations from growth of algae and moulds on the façades already a few years after construction. It has not always been possible to explain this discolouration. Sometimes one part of the façade had discolorations and another part of the same façade did not. One possible explanation for the fast growth of organisms is the external rendering layer (on thermal insulation that has a low heat capacity and during night the long-wave radiation from the material to the sky can contribute to a lower temperature on the surface than the temperature in the air -on clear nights, when the heat loses through long-wave radiation is high. The lowered surface temperature then causes the RH on the surface to increase, sometimes giving condensation -which increases the risk of biological growth. In this project we have compared temperatures and RH on surfaces on façade elements in a test house with constructions with low heat capacity in the outermost layer (light walls) and constructions with a high heat capacity in the outermost layer (heavy walls). Simulations of the growth risk showed that thin rendering on thermal insulation has a higher growth risk that traditionally render on bricks especially on the north side. On the south side the most important factor was the surface colour. In our study we compared a red and a white surface, and since dark surface colours absorbs more short-wave radiation from the sun they have a higher temperature during daytime and therefore a lower RH on the surface. Another factor which might influence the growth risk is the surface structure of the render. We fabricated specimens with different renders with different surface structures and with a thin and thick rendering layer (3 mm and 20 mm, respectively) and exposed the specimens outdoors for four years. This study showed that algaes preferred a very rough surface structure while moulds (Cladosporium sp.) also grew on more smooth surfaces. In addition we found that algaes most often grew on the north side whereas moulds rather grew on the south side (Cladosporium has a dark pigment in the cells which protects against radiation from the sun). Furthermore we found a connection between the amount of growth and the season of the year. The biological growth was more clearly seen during spring and especially autumn and occasionally seemed to disappear during summer and winter. It was found that thin (3 - 4 mm) and thick (20 mm) render on thermal insulation had the same amount of discolouration. The activity of photosynthetic organisms -algae, lichens and mosseson façades can be measured with Imaging-PAM. This is an instrument that measures the chlorophyll fluorescence and gives an indirect measure of photosynthetic activity. A pilot study was performed where we -during three days in the autumn- studied algae and mosses growing on render. Algae dries out easily and is dependent of moisture from the surroundings and showed the highest activity during mornings before the sun dried them out. The mosses were active a greater part of the day; they are able to some extent store water in their leaves and is not as dependent on moisture from the surroundings as algae. Another method for measuring activity of biological organisms is isothermal calorimetry which measures the produced heat from an organism’s metabolism. In this project we tested a new type of calorimeter that measures activity at four different temperatures at the same time. With measurements of a moss (Tortula ruralis) we found {{that it was possible to}} get an activity measure at four different temperatures at the same time, thus being able to get an understanding of how the temperature influences the activity. This method should therefore be very useful in future studies of activity of different types of biological organisms. The aim of this project was to investigate constructions of thin rendering on thermal insulation and the biological organisms growing on the façades of these constructions. With a multidisciplinary approach we have increased the knowledge of the façade as a habitat, the organisms growing, and their interactions with different biotic and abiotic factors...|$|R
