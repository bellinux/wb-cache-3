5|$|Being highly {{arboreal}} and {{the most}} frugivorous of the lemurs, they thrive only in primary forest with large fruiting trees, where they spend most <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> in the upper canopy. By spending the majority <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> in the crown of tall forest trees, they are relatively safe from predators such as the fossa.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} species are adapted to {{spending}} a portion <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> feeding on the ground, and a very small minority have abandoned trees entirely and nest in holes in the ground. The ground woodpecker is one such species, inhabiting the rocky and grassy hills of South Africa, and the Andean flicker is another.|$|E

5|$|Adult solitary wasps {{spend most}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> in {{preparing}} their nests and foraging for food for their young, mostly insects or spiders. Their nesting habits are more diverse {{than those of}} social wasps. Many species dig burrows in the ground. Mud daubers and pollen wasps construct mud cells in sheltered places. Potter wasps similarly build vase-like nests from mud, often with multiple cells, attached to the twigs of trees or against walls.|$|E
5|$|After resigning {{from the}} presidency, Suharto reclused {{himself in his}} family {{compound}} in the Menteng area of Jakarta, protected by soldiers and rarely making public appearances. Suharto's family spend much <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> fending-off corruption investigations. However, Suharto himself was protected from serious prosecution by politicians who owed their positions to the former president, as indicated in the leaked telephone conversation between President Habibie and attorney-general Andi Muhammad Ghalib in February 1999.|$|E
5|$|As the {{political}} power in Norway was consolidated and {{had to contend with}} external threats, larger structures were built in accordance with military technology at the time.

5|$|Bears have {{a fairly}} simple {{digestive}} system typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short undifferentiated intestines and no cecum. Even the herbivorous giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Bears must spend much <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> feeding {{in order to gain}} enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.|$|E
5|$|Because banded sea kraits {{spend much}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> on land, {{they are often}} {{encountered}} by humans. They are frequently found in the water intake and exhaust pipes of boats. Banded sea kraits are also attracted to light and can be distracted by artificial sources of light, including hotels and other buildings, on coasts.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly larvae, or caterpillars, consume plant {{leaves and}} spend {{practically}} all <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> searching for and eating food. Although most caterpillars are herbivorous, a few species are predators: Spalgis epius eats scale insects, while lycaenids such as Liphyra brassolis are myrmecophilous, eating ant larvae.|$|E

5|$|California {{sea lions}} have a {{polygynous}} breeding pattern. From May to August, males establish territories {{and try to}} attract females with which to mate. Females are free to move in between territories, and are not coerced by males. Mothers nurse their pups in between foraging trips. Sea lions communicate with numerous vocalizations, notably with barks and mother-pup contact calls. Outside their breeding season, sea lions spend much <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> at sea, but they come to shore to molt.|$|E
5|$|Disbanded in August 1951 {{along with}} all the other Ranger companies, the unit's {{soldiers}} accrued several awards in its 10-month existence. These included four campaign streamers, nine Silver Star Medals and over 100 Purple Heart Medals. Subsequent research has focused on the economy of force of how the Rangers were employed and how their performance was impacted by the racist policies <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 17th century and early 18th century, while Monaco was officially an {{independent}} state, {{it was in}} reality a province of France.

5|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, the park {{experienced}} {{a surge in}} vandalism, littering, and wildfires caused by off-roading, and Roxy Ann Road became nearly impassable {{because of lack of}} maintenance. Medford police officers had to devote much <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> to patrolling the mountain, made difficult by the park's remote location. To alleviate these problems, the city regraded Roxy Ann Road in 1998, and installed two gates near the park entrance two years later. By 2006, vandalism had decreased by 70 percent.|$|E
5|$|Each clan has a {{specified}} area {{of land that}} all members contribute to foraging from and defending. Frequently, territory sizes, normally , are correlated with the abundance of rain and resources in a region; smaller territories occur where insects and resources are plentiful. Additionally, the feeding territories are larger {{during the winter months}} when these birds spend much <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> foraging with the entire clan. White-winged fairywrens occupy much larger territories than other fairywren species.|$|E

5|$|In Byzantium, the {{elementary}} school teacher occupied a low social position and taught mainly from simple fairy tale books (Aesop's Fables were often used). However, the grammarian and rhetorician, teachers responsible for the following two phases of education, were more respected. These used classical Greek texts like Homer's Iliad or Odyssey and much <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> was taken with detailed word-for-word explication. Books were rare and very expensive and likely only possessed by teachers who dictated passages to students.|$|E
