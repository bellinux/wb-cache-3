5|$|Despite his equestrian background, Macrinus was {{accepted}} by the Senate for two reasons: {{for the removal of}} Caracalla, and for having received the loyalty of the army. The senators were less concerned by Macrinus' Mauretanian ancestry than by his equestrian social background and scrutinized his actions as emperor. Their opinion <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>was</b> reduced by his decisions to appoint men to high offices who were of similarly undistinguished background. Only the Senate had the constitutional power to choose the emperor from among the senators and Macrinus, not being a senator and having become emperor through force rather than through traditional means, was looked down upon.|$|E

5|$|Elections {{were held}} in May 1963, pitting Kenyatta's KANU against KADU, the Akamba People's Party, and various {{independent}} candidates; the former were victorious with 83 seats out of 124. On 1 June 1963, Kenyatta {{was sworn in as}} prime minister of the autonomous Kenyan government. He was the country's first Prime Minister to come from its indigenous population. Kenya remained a monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state. In November 1963, Kenyatta's government introduced a law making it a criminal offence to disrespect the Prime Minister, with exile as a punishment. Kenyatta's personality became a central aspect of the creation of the new state. In December, Nairobi's Delaware Avenue was renamed Kenyatta Avenue, and a bronze statue <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>was</b> erected beside the country's National Assembly. Photographs of Kenyatta were widely displayed in shop windows, and a likeness of his face was also printed on the new currency. In 1964, Oxford University Press published a collection of Kenyatta's speeches under the title of Harambee!.|$|E

He accepted this shore job with reluctance since he loathed administration, but the Board of Admiralty's high regard <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>was</b> evident. For six months during an illness of Admiral Sir Roger Backhouse, the then First Sea Lord, he deputised for Backhouse on the Committee of Imperial Defence and on the Admiralty Board. In 1939 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB), becoming known as Sir Andrew Cunningham.|$|E

5|$|Kroonland was {{the scene}} of an {{attempted}} murder-suicide in October 1908. Two acquaintances in steerage had an argument over a young female second-class passenger that both men knew. One man threw a knife at the other—only slightly wounding him—and then fled and jumped over the railing into the English Channel near Dover. U.S. Senator Benjamin Tillman and his wife were aboard the liner at the time and saw the young man jump overboard. Although the ship lowered a boat to look for him, no trace <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>was</b> found, and he was presumed drowned.|$|E
5|$|Punk's matches with Cabana led him {{to being}} hired by the Ring of Honor promotion. From February 2003 until May 2004, Punk refused to wrestle for IWA Mid-South, {{explaining}} this as a protest to Ian Rotten's mistreatment of Chris Hero in the company. Hero, however, has stated he believes there were other reasons, and Rotten's treatment <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>was</b> just an excuse by Punk to stop working for the company. Eventually Punk returned to IWA Mid-South and continued to perform as a wrestler and commentator for them until 2005 when he was signed to World Wrestling Entertainment. His last appearance in IWA Mid-South was on July 2, 2005 in which he competed in a 60-minute time limit draw against Delirious.|$|E
5|$|Robson's {{achievements}} with Ipswich {{earned him}} {{an offer from}} the Football Association to become the England national coach; he declined an offer of a ten-year contract extension from Ipswich director Patrick Cobbold.

During his 13-year tenure at Ipswich, Robson brought in only 14 players from other clubs, relying instead on players developed through the club's youth programmes. In 2002, in recognition of Robson's achievements with the club, a life-size statue <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>was</b> unveiled opposite the Cobbold Stand at Portman Road.

5|$|In 1897, Victoria {{had written}} {{instructions}} for her funeral, {{which was to}} be military as befitting a soldier's daughter {{and the head of the}} army, and white instead of black. On 25 January, Edward VII, the Kaiser and Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, helped lift her body into the coffin. She was dressed in a white dress and her wedding veil. An array of mementos commemorating her extended family, friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her, at her request, by her doctor and dressers. One of Albert's dressing gowns was placed by her side, with a plaster cast of his hand, while a lock of John Brown's hair, along with a picture <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> <b>was</b> placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers. Items of jewellery placed on Victoria included the wedding ring of John Brown's mother, given to her by Brown in 1883. Her funeral was held on Saturday 2 February, in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and after two days of lying-in-state, she was interred beside Prince Albert in Frogmore Mausoleum at Windsor Great Park.|$|E

He retired from the British Army in July 1945, although he continued to serve as an officer in the Territorial Army, raising the 4th Parachute Brigade (Territorial Army) in 1947 and serving as its commanding officer until 1949. After standing down as commander of the brigade, Hill served on the board of a number of companies, including Lloyds Bank, the Associated Coal and Wharf Companies, and Powell Duffryn of Canada. Hill was an avid birdwatcher, with a particular claim to fame for being only the second person to discover a cuckoo's egg in the nest of a whinchat. He also helped to set up the Parachute Regiment Association and the Airborne Forces Security fund, acting as a trustee of the latter organisation for thirty years and chairman for five years. Hill married for a second time, wedding Joan Patricia Haywood in 1986. On 6 June 2004 he attended the 60th Anniversary of the Normandy landings, and a bronze statue <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>was</b> unveiled at Le Mesnil crossroads by Charles, Prince of Wales, Colonel-in-Chief of The Parachute Regiment.

5|$|The ballad Master McGrath {{concerns}} a greyhound {{of that name}} from Lurgan which became an Irish sporting hero. The dog was bought in Lurgan by the Brownlow family, and the song also mentions his owner Charles Brownlow, {{referred to in the}} lyrics as Lord Lurgan. Master McGrath won the Waterloo Cup hare coursing competition three times in 1868, 1870 and 1871 at a time when this was a high-profile sport. A post mortem found that he had a heart twice the size of what is normal for a dog of his size. He is remembered all over the town, including in its coat of arms. The dog was named McGrath after the kennel boy responsible for its care. A statue <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>was</b> unveiled at Craigavon Civic Centre in 1993, over 120 years after his last glory in 1871. The statue was relocated to Lurgan town centre in 2013. A festival is also held yearly in his honour. A Lurgan pub was also named after Master McGrath, although it has been renamed in recent years.|$|E
