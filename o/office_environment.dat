25|$|Thomas' arithmometer, {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} machine, was manufactured {{two hundred years}} later in 1851; {{it was the first}} mechanical calculator strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an <b>office</b> <b>environment.</b> For forty years the arithmometer was the only type of mechanical calculator available for sale.|$|E
500|$|The American Society of Mechanical Engineers recognized, Carrier's [...] "Manufactured Weather" [...] {{had many}} benefits. Cooled offices helped in tenant retention. The <b>office</b> <b>environment</b> became more {{efficient}} and hospitable due to the elimination or reduction of unwanted elements. The building owners also found they could charge a premium of 10 to 15 percent more rent for air conditioned offices. In short, the deal between Travis Investment Company and Carrier Engineering resulted in the first high-rise, fully air conditioned, office building in the United States.|$|E

500|$|Michael Scott's (Steve Carell) [...] "best friend forever" [...] Todd Packer (David Koechner) offends {{the staff}} with crude gossip about an upper {{management}} scandal. Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) informs Michael {{that he will}} conduct {{a review of the}} company's sexual harassment policies because the CFO resigned after allegations made by his secretary. [...] Michael's indignation that this will put a damper on his easygoing <b>office</b> <b>environment</b> rises to outrage when he learns that the corporate headquarters is sending down a lawyer to talk to him. Michael and the warehouse staff mock the sexual harassment video, but the crude remarks come to a screeching halt when Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) and the lawyer arrive from Corporate.|$|E
500|$|Screenings for {{the episode}} {{was shown in}} Los Angeles, California on July 21, 2010, and again five days later at Duffy Square in New York City an hour before it was {{televised}} nationwide. An estimated 10,000 people appeared at the screening in New York City. The designs of costumes were altered, according to Bryant, to reflect the general fashion development and changes in mainstream pop culture during the 1960s. In {{an interview with the}} San Francisco Chronicle, she teased: [...] "My characters are in an <b>office</b> <b>environment</b> in New York; it's very different from {{what was going on in}} London at the time. But there will be some progression in their costumes, just like in real life.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{received}} generally well by critics. Brian Zoromski of IGN stated that: [...] "Any episode that places Michael and Dwight {{outside of their}} normal <b>office</b> <b>environment</b> is set up for some very funny (and usually awkward) situations and 'The Convention' is no exception. Some of the episode's best uncomfortable moments centered on Michael believing he's {{the life of the}} party and that he's Jim's friend. Michael and Dwight pretending to laugh along to an inside joke made by Jim's new boss, Josh, is a prime example. Michael's comment, 'I love inside jokes. Love to be part of one someday,' creates the kind of uncomfortable silence that The Office excels at." [...] Also on IGN, the show received a 9.8 out of 10 [...] "incredible" [...] rating from the site's editorial staff.|$|E

2500|$|Americans seem {{to report}} more {{loneliness}} {{than any other}} country, though this finding may simply be an effect of greater research volume. A 2006 study in the American Sociological Review found that Americans on average had only two close friends in which to confide, which was down {{from an average of}} three in 1985. The percentage of people who noted having no such confidant rose from 10% to almost 25%, and an additional 19% said they had only a single confidant, often their spouse, thus raising the risk of serious loneliness if the relationship ended. The modern <b>office</b> <b>environment</b> has been demonstrated to give rise to loneliness. [...] This can be especially prevalent in individuals prone to social isolation who can interpret the business focus of co-workers for a deliberate ignoring of needs.|$|E
2500|$|The current working {{uniform of}} the Coast Guard is the Operational Dress Uniform (ODU). The ODU may be worn year-round {{primarily}} as a field utility and watchstanding uniform, but may also be worn in an <b>office</b> <b>environment</b> where appropriate. The ODU {{is similar to the}} Battle Dress Uniform of other armed services, both in function and style. However, the ODU is in a solid dark blue with no camouflage pattern and does not have lower pockets on the blouse. The first generation ODU, in service from 2004 to 2012, was worn tucked in. The second generation ODU is worn untucked and has black Coast Guard insignia embroidered on the left shirt pocket as well as the side pockets of the trousers. The ODU is worn with composite-toed boots in most circumstances, but low-cut brown boat shoes may be prescribed for certain vessel boarding operations. A standard baseball-style ball cap is worn, embroidered in gold block lettering with [...] "U.S. Coast Guard." [...] Units may also additionally authorize ball caps with the unit name embroidered for wear while on the unit. A foul weather parka is the outerwear worn with the ODU. The ODU's success and practicality as a working uniform has led the U.S. Public Health Service and the NOAA Corps to adopt ODU variants as standard working uniforms. Some Navy personnel also advocated adoption of the ODU as a standard shipboard uniform for the Navy, rather than the unpopular Navy Working Uniform Type I.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to invite a changed {{perception}} of active sitting, to introduce a more active way of sitting in <b>office</b> <b>environments</b> and destigmatize an active sitting posture such as straddling by giving active sitting products conscious aesthetics based on environment and positive associations. The goal with this project was an active sitting product for <b>office</b> <b>environments</b> with aesthetics considered encouraging to movement in a relaxed way, regardless of age and gender, and connect to materials and aesthetics related to activity, experience and recreation. Horseback riding, retro style surfing and skateboarding was an entry of investigation. The project was based on existing active sitting products, their function and production techniques.
