40|$|Today’s {{construction}} buildings {{contain more}} advanced technologies than before. The development of newer and stricter regulations {{to the construction}} industry makes the door environment more and more complex. In large construction projects the door environment is held up as a major challenge to get to in a good way. It turned out after a discussion with one project manager and a site manager at NCC, that the door environment is difficult to get right in major construction projects and it often causes many error reports in to the aftermarket after that the final inspection is completed. Interviews have been done with key figures in the building process at NCC and Akademiska hus. A study on a university building for around 3500 students and with 300 workplaces was made.

5000|$|Electro-pneumatic - {{the motor}} drives an air {{compressor}} {{and may be}} located away from the door. The air pressure is used to drive the <b>operator</b> above the <b>door.</b> This type is not common, and noise can be a factor if compressor is located close to a door. Typically, the compressor can be located up to 200 feet away ensuring that noise is not a factor. A typical life expectancy of a pneaumtic system is 10-15 years except the compressor. Best application of a pneumatic system is in a residential environment where usage is limited to 30-40 times a day.|$|R

40|$|Wine {{tourism is}} {{experiencing}} significant development in both {{new and old}} European wine regions. In {{the case of the}} Canary Islands, wine has been produced and traded for centuries but {{little is known about the}} current state or potential for wine tourism on the islands, despite the fact that millions of tourists, including many potential wine tourists, visit the islands each year. In this exploratory study, the perspectives of winery owners and managers on wine tourism are examined via in-depth face-to-face interviews among 23 small winery operators to reveal that the scope for exploiting wine tourism on the islands has been recognized and that some wineries are either already involved in wine tourism, includ-ing as part of a wine trail, or plan to be more involved in the future. It was also discovered, that there were a number of issues that challenge the development of their wine and wine tourism industry, includ-ing competition from non-Canary Island wines and anti-drink-drive laws that are inhibit passers by to consume wine at the cellar <b>door.</b> <b>Operators</b> stressed the need to find a balance between mass tourism and the niche produce of wine.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} establishment of new wineries, cellar doors are now marketing in an energetic manner to attract wine tourists; as a result, cellar door managers are increasingly concerned with factors {{leading to the}} differentiation of their cellar doors and visitors’ post-visit behaviours. However, {{despite the fact that}} the cellar door experience is logically of great importance from both the wine tourism and wine marketing perspectives, little is known about the detailed relationships between the different aspects of a visitor’s cellar door experience and how these aspects interact to affect a visitor’s post-visit behavioural intentions. This study features an exploration of the effects of winery cellar door inputs on visitors’ monetary and experiential value perceptions, overall satisfaction and behavioural intentions. The results of this study provide preliminary evidence that a memorable cellar door experience encompasses not only the selection of the core wine product but also other components, including the appreciation of the cellar door environment and the face-to-face interaction with the front-line employees that facilitate the visit. Further, the application of Partial Least Squares path modelling indicates that cellar door visitors are oriented towards the experiential aspects of the visit itself as much as pragmatic considerations in purchasing wine. The insights are, therefore, directed towards the creation of a total cellar door experience. The research shows that cellar <b>door</b> <b>operators</b> cannot solely rely on good-quality wine to maintain their business. Their marketing differentiation strategy needs to shift from a goods-based offering to including the creation of hedonic and utilitarian experiential value on a consistent basis, to maintain visitor satisfaction and enhance customer loyalty.

40|$|Mining haul trucks {{comprise}} {{the majority of}} the equipment used in underground limestone mining operations and are known to emit high levels of noise. A previous study conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) indicates that 70 - 90 percent of all miners have a noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) great enough to be classified as a hearing disability by retirement age. These results demonstrate the public health need to protect the hearing of workers in the mining industry, including haul truck drivers. Cab enclosures present an opportunity to isolate the haul truck operator from both truck and other noise in the mining environment. A total of twenty-five haul truck cabs were studied which were divided into three style (treatment) categories determined by soundproofing features and technology for noise reduction: old-, new-, and retrofitted-style. This study examines the contribution of cab acoustics, operator performance, and maintenance to noise reduction for each cab style. Dosimeters were used to measure 8 -hr time weighted average sound pressure levels (TWA 8 SPLs) inside and outside the cabs to determine if different acoustical treatments affect cab attenuation. Adherence to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) of 90 dB TWA 8 (with a 90 dB threshold) was used as the main indicator of overall noise reduction achieved. Dosimetery results indicate only 2 % of the samples exceeded the PEL, but samples could still be reduced much further. Descriptive and comparative statistics indicate that noise levels inside the new-style cabs are significantly lower than the other two cab styles. Also, data suggest that there is no difference in noise exposures when comparing the old-style to retrofitted cab styles. <b>Operator</b> influence (opening <b>doors</b> and windows) was a significant factor for increasing noise exposure. This paper demonstrates that properly designed cabs can achieve major noise reductions, but noise levels could still be reduced much further below the MSHA PEL. New-style cabs, equipped with modern noise-reduction treatments, exhibit much lower noise exposures than the other two cabs styles, and the effectiveness of the current noise-reduction treatments for retrofitted cabs is questionable. Haul truck driver observations indicate that improved noise exposure reduction training is needed. Finally, specific targets for future noise reduction research are suggested that will further contribute to the prevention of hearing loss for haul truck operators...|$|R
40|$|We {{make two}} main {{contributions}} in this thesis. First, we present {{our approach to}} robot manipulation, which emphasizes the benefits of making contact with the world across all the surfaces of a manipulator with whole-arm tactile sensing and compliant actuation at the joints. In contrast, many current approaches to mobile manipulation assume most contact is {{a failure of the}} system, restrict contact to only occur at well modeled end effectors, and use stiff, precise control to avoid contact. We develop a controller that enables robots with whole-arm tactile sensing and compliant actuation at the joints to reach to locations in high clutter while regulating contact forces. We assume that low contact forces are benign and our controller does not place any penalty on contact forces below a threshold. Our controller only requires haptic sensing, handles multiple contacts {{across the surface of the}} manipulator, and does not need an explicit model of the environment prior to contact. It uses model predictive control with a time horizon of length one, and a linear quasi-static mechanical model that it constructs at each time step. We show that our controller enables both a real and simulated robots to reach goal locations in high clutter with low contact forces. While doing so, the robots bend, compress, slide, and pivot around objects. To enable experiments on real robots, we also developed an inexpensive, flexible, and stretchable tactile sensor and covered large surfaces of two robot arms with these sensors. With an informal experiment, we show that our controller and sensor have the potential to enable robots to manipulate in close proximity to, and in contact with humans while keeping the contact forces low. Second, we present an approach to give robots common sense about everyday forces in the form of probabilistic data-driven object-centric models of haptic interactions. These models can be shared by different robots for improved manipulation performance. We use pulling open doors, an important task for service robots, as an example to demonstrate our approach. Specifically, we capture and model the statistics of forces while pulling open doors and drawers. Using a portable custom force and motion capture system, we create a database of forces as human <b>operators</b> pull open <b>doors</b> and drawers in six homes and one office. We then build data-driven models of the expected forces while opening a mechanism, given knowledge of either its class (e. g, refrigerator) or the mechanism identity (e. g, a particular cabinet in Advait's kitchen). We demonstrate that these models can enable robots to detect anomalous conditions such as a locked door, or collisions between the door and the environment faster and with lower excess force applied to the door compared to methods that do not use a database of forces.
