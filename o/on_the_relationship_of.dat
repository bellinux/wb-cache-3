5|$|Prior to Witten's announcement, string theorists had {{identified}} five versions of superstring theory. Although these theories appeared, at first, {{to be very}} different, work by several physicists showed that the theories were related in intricate and nontrivial ways. In particular, physicists found that apparently distinct theories could be unified by mathematical transformations called S-duality and T-duality. Witten's conjecture was {{based in part on}} the existence of these dualities and in part <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> the string theories to a field theory called eleven-dimensional supergravity.|$|E

While Strange focuses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> two men, Jonathan Strange and Gilbert Norrell, the stories in Ladies focus on the power women gain through magic.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} book Schleiermacher gave {{religion}} an unchanging place among the divine mysteries of human nature, distinguished it from what he regarded as current caricatures of religion, and described the perennial forms of its manifestation.

25|$|Because of the {{priority}} and rank ordering feature of bankruptcy law, debtors sometimes improperly collude with others (who {{may be related}} to the debtor) to prefer them, by for example granting them a security interest in otherwised unpledged assets. For this reason, the bankruptcy trustee is permitted to reverse certain transactions of the debtor within period of time prior to the date of bankruptcy filing.

25|$|Birds {{were also}} {{widely used in}} studies of the niche {{hypothesis}} and Georgii Gause's competitive exclusion principle.

Work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> {{the number of species}} to area and its application in the study of island biogeography was pioneered by E. O. Wilson and Robert MacArthur.

It is popular in elementary school curricula, and has been used in scholarly studies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> children to racial identity and reading.

25|$|Because of {{its many}} unique characteristics, the {{evolutionary}} relationships of the barbeled houndshark {{are difficult to}} resolve. A morphological study by Compagno in 1988 was inconclusive <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> Leptocharias to other carcharhiniform families. Similarly, a molecular phylogenetic study by López et al. in 2006 found that, though Leptocharias certainly belonged to a derived clade also containing the families Hemigaleidae, Triakidae, Carcharhinidae and Sphyrnidae, its position within that group changed depending on the DNA sequence and type of analysis used. Fossilized teeth belonging to an extinct relative, L. cretaceus, have been recovered from Late Cretaceous (Santonian and Campanian ages, 8672 Ma) deposits in Britain.|$|E
25|$|On August 18, 1970, the NAACP {{filed suit}} against Michigan state officials, {{including}} Governor William Milliken, charging de facto public school segregation. The trial began April 6, 1971, and lasted 41 days. The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain racial segregation in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices (such as redlining of certain neighborhoods) and educational segregation, which followed segregated neighborhoods. District Judge Steven J. Roth held {{all levels of government}} accountable for the segregation in his ruling on Milliken v. Bradley. The Sixth Circuit Court affirmed some of the decision, withholding judgment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> housing inequality with education. The court specified that it was the state's responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area.|$|E
25|$|Set {{gillnets}} {{consist of}} a single netting wall kept vertical by a floatline (upper line/headrope) and a weighted groundline (lower line/footrope). Small floats, usually shaped like eggs or cylinders and made of solid plastic, are evenly distributed along the floatline, while lead weights are evenly distributed along groundline. The lower line can also be made of lead cored rope, which does not need additional weight. The net is set on the bottom, or at a distance above it and held in place with anchors or weights on both ends. By adjusting the design these nets can fish in surface layers, in mid water or at the bottom, targeting pelagic, demersal or benthic species. On small boats gillnets are handled by hand. Larger boats use hydraulic net haulers or net drums. Set gillnets are widely used all over the world, and are employed both in inland and sea waters. They are popular with artisanal fisheries because no specialized gear is needed, and it is low cost based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> fuel/fish.|$|E
