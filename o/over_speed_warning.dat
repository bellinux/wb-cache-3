50|$|The power {{assisted}} steering with tilt and collapsible mechanism and protection guard ensures driver safety. There are absolutely no airbags. The front brakes are discs with twin pot four-piston calliper while rear drums are assisted with auto adjuster. One of the unique feature is the <b>over</b> <b>speed</b> <b>warning</b> that warns if the SUV crosses the permissible speed limit. Remote key entry, driver seat warning, door open warning and display, ultrasonic reverse parking sensors for parking in tight spaces, brake pad wear warning along with central looking are other safety features. The SX variant comes with option of ABS and the LX variant comes with ABS and 4-wheel drive system as standard.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT − Detection of lane {{markings}} {{based on}} a camera sensor can be a low cost solution to lane departure and curve <b>over</b> <b>speed</b> <b>warning.</b> A number of methods and implementations {{have been reported in}} the literature. However, reliable detection is still an issue due to cast shadows, wearied and occluded markings, variable ambient lighting conditions etc. We focus on increasing the reliability of detection in two ways. Firstly, we employ a different image feature other than the commonly used edges: ridges, which we claim is better suited to this problem. Secondly, we have adapted RANSAC, a generic robust estimation method, to fit a parametric model of a pair or lane lines to the image features, based on both ridgeness and ridge orientation. In addition this fitting is performed for the left and right lane lines simultaneously, thus enforcing a consistent result. Four measures of interest with regard several driver assistance applications are directly computed from the fitted parametric model at each frame: vehicle yaw angle and lateral offset with regard the lane medial axis, and lane width and curvature. We have qualitatively assessed our method in video sequences captured on several road types and under very different lighting conditions. Also, we have quantitatively assessed it on synthetic but realistic video sequences for which road geometry and vehicle trajectory ground truth are known...|$|E

The crew discussed {{a way to}} go through / in between / around the weather. The co-pilot was also again heard exclaiming about the huge size of the cell/severe weather, seen on their weather radar. The co-pilot also suggested to wait and orbit for 10 minutes as the cell could be observed to be moving already, but the Captain did not respond to the suggestion. The Captain visually spotted the runway at 12:54. The <b>Over</b> <b>speed</b> Audio <b>warning</b> is audible on the CVR in 12:55 as the flaps were being lowered in excess of permissible speed. At 12:56:21, sound similar to rain falling on the cockpit was picked up on the CVR. Rain falling on the windscreen is audible on the CVR till end of recording.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Driving {{too fast}} {{is one of}} the most {{prevalent}} factors that contribute to traffic crashes. In school zones, staying alert and obeying the posted speed limit especially during the school period are imperative for public safety, particularly involving children. Encouraging motorists to travel at safe speeds through the installation of yellow transverse bars at Seri Sabak Uni School and Pintas Puding School was found to be ineffective. Drivers were observed to have violated the 30 km/h speed limit and more seriously, driven <b>over</b> the <b>speed</b> limits of adjoining roads. Consequently, <b>speed</b> camera <b>warning</b> signs were erected as a pre-emptive measure to curtail speeding problems in the school zones. From impact studies carried out to measure the effectiveness of these signs, it was found that the <b>speed</b> camera <b>warning</b> signs were also not able to change driver behavior...|$|R

40|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>warning</b> and {{enforcement}} {{can be applied}} locally, on a road-stretch and on a road-network. Local automatic <b>speed</b> <b>warning</b> at an urban intersection reduced the mean speed by 5 km/h. Theoretically a reduction in accidents of 25 - 65 % can be achieved. At a rural intersection, the speed limit was reduced from 100 to 70 km/h. An automatic sign warns speeding cars; {{this resulted in a}} lowering of the mean speed from around 80 to 63 km/h. An automatic <b>speed</b> <b>warning</b> {{and enforcement}} system on 2 -lane rural road stretches - speed limit 80 km/h - resulted in a reduction of the mean speed from 78 to 73 km/h, the percentage of speeders went down from 40 to 10 %. The total number of accidents was reduced by 35 %. This effect was almost the same, 3 years after concluding the experiment. Vandalism was a problem. This could be diminished by mounting the camera on a high pole, mechanically preventing climbing the pole, automatic detection of vandalism and wireless communication to a near-by police station. Enforcement of speed on a provincial road network using radar and camera exclusively, from a parked unmarked car, was conducted in three provinces. A sign, downstream of the enforcement site, shows `Your speed has been checked. Police'. Periodical information campaigns were conducted to increase the subjective risk of being caught. The result was a reduction of average speed by 4 - 5 km/h, though the percentage of speeders is still high: reduction from 40 to 30 %. This type of enforcement is accepted by 75 % of the drivers. Greater priority for speed enforcement is needed, also automating the enforcement and processing to increase the efficiency...|$|R

With some engines even a momentary <b>over</b> <b>speed</b> can result in greatly reduced engine life or even catastrophic failure.

40|$|A general {{problem of}} {{enforcement}} of traffic laws in industrialized countries is the limited priority this problem gets {{in relation to}} criminal offences. Furthermore the available police manpower often is not being employed efficiently. Therefore more and more automated warning and enforcement systems are being applied on the roads. These systems can be put into operation locally, on a stretch of road and in a network. Several experiments have been conducted in the Netherlands in this field with positive effects on speed behaviour and road safety. Automatic <b>speed</b> <b>warning</b> at the approach of an intersection in The Hague gave a reduction in mean speed of 5 km/h. The possible effect on accidents was calculated based on a scenario; a reduction of several tenths of percentages in accidents was the result. In the province of Friesland the speed limit at {{the approach of the}} intersection was reduced from 100 to 70 km/h and an automatic <b>speed</b> <b>warning</b> sign flashes when cars were driving faster than 70 km/h. In the beginning a police car was posted periodically at that intersection. The mean speed went down from around 80 km/h to 63 km/h, and the percentage of speeders remained at about the same level (lowered speed limit!). On four provincial road stretches with a speed limit of 80 km/h an automatic <b>speed</b> <b>warning</b> and enforcement system resulted in a total average reduction of the mean speed from 78 to 73 km/h and the percentage of speeders went down from 40 % to 10 %. The total number of accidents was reduced with 35 %. Projects on enforcement of speed on a provincial road network have just started in the Netherlands. The main aspect is the exclusive use of inconspicuous radar and camera that to be moved after 2 hours of enforcement to another location. Feedback information is given to all passing vehicles downstream of the enforcement site showing 'Your speed has been checked. Police'. This campaign is combined by periodical information campaigns to increase the subjective risk of being caught. In a separate part of one province conventional enforcement technique stopping speeders along the road will be evaluated too...|$|R
