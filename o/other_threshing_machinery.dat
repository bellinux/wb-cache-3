50|$|Like other {{mackerel}} sharks, bigeye threshers are ovoviviparous {{and bear}} litters of two pups, {{one in each}} uterus. Very rarely, the litter size may be one, three, or four. There is no defined breeding season and most adult females are pregnant throughout the year without any apparent lag time between pregnancies. The gestation period is unknown. The developing fetuses are initially nourished by a yolk sac, and later on exhibit oophagy, in which they consume infertile eggs produced by their mother (and possibly also uterine fluid). There {{is no evidence of}} sibling cannibalism as in the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus). Unborn embryos are similar in appearance to adults, with proportionally larger heads and eyes. They are covered with a thin layer of epithelium that prevents the uterine wall from being abraded by the embryo's sharp dermal denticles; this has not been observed in the young of <b>other</b> <b>thresher</b> sharks. The young measure 1.35 - 1.4 m long at birth. Males mature at a length around 2.7 - 2.9 m and at an age of 9 - 10 years, while females mature at a length around 3.3 - 3.6 m and at an age of 12 - 14 years. The maximum lifespan of this species is believed to be 19 years for a male and 20 years for a female. A female bigeye thresher is estimated to produce only 20 young over her entire life.|$|R
40|$|The {{thorough}} investigation of both grain threshing and grain separating processes {{is a crucial}} consideration for effective structural design and variable optimization of the tangential flow threshing cylinder and longitudinal axial flow threshing cylinder composite units (TLFC unit) of small and medium-sized (SME) combine harvesters. The objective {{of this paper was}} to obtain the structural variables of a TLFC unit by theoretical modeling and experimentation on a tangential flow threshing cylinder unit (TFC unit) and longitudinal axial flow threshing cylinder unit (LFC unit). Threshing and separation equations for five types of threshing teeth (knife bar, trapezoidal tooth, spike tooth, rasp bar, and rectangular bar), were obtained using probability theory. Results demonstrate that the threshing and separation capacity of the knife bar TFC unit was stronger than the <b>other</b> <b>threshing</b> teeth. The length of the LFC unit was divided into four sections, with helical blades on the first section (0 - 0. 17 m), the spike tooth on the second section (0. 17 - 1. 48 m), the trapezoidal tooth on the third section (1. 48 - 2. 91 m), and the discharge plate on the fourth section (2. 91 - 3. 35 m). Test results showed an un-threshed grain rate of 0. 243 %, un-separated grain rate of 0. 346 %, and broken grain rate of 0. 184 %. Evidenced by these results, threshing and separation performance is significantly improved by analyzing and optimizing the structure and variables of a TLFC unit. The results of this research can be used to successfully design the TLFC unit of small and medium-sized (SME) combine harvesters. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{describe}} the CEP package for compressing EPS files. It belongs to the public domain and was released at the GUST meeting in Bachotek, 1997. The amount of disk space occupied by bitmap graphics is a well-recognized problem. For example, a 300 dpi picture (A 4) contains ca 8700000 pixels; assuming that each CMYK pixel occupies four bytes, one obtains ca 35 MB of disk space needed to store the picture. Now, imagine a TEX-er, who {{is not allowed to}} use binary graphic data (because of the otherwise magnificent DVIPS); thus our poor TEX-er usually converts the binary data to hexadecimal EPS files, thus doubling the required space, and next, after compiling a document with TEX+DVIPS, the whole graphic data is put into the resulting PostScript file, so the required space is doubled again — altogether 140 MB per one A 4 page. The nightmare begins [...] . This problem is not a new one; it was recognised by Adobe a relatively long time ago. In the Post-Script Level 2 specification, they included objects called filters which enable data compression. In particular, instead of hexadecimal data, one can use ASCII 85 encoding (there are explanations of abbreviations {{at the end of the}} article), run length compression, LZW compression, DCT (used in JPEG files), and many others. Why not make use of these tools? The question is not as silly as it may look at the first glance, as there exist relatively few applications capable of generating well-compressed PostScript graphics. We decided to patch somehow this gap. We developed a little package enabling the compression of “normal ” (non-compressed) graphic data. The nature of the problem is more complex, however, than one might expect. In particular, a universal, always efficient compression technique does not exist. Choice of an optimal algorithm depends upon the kind of data, form of the file and the expected application. Hence, the package has several “buttons” which enable controlling various aspects of compression. Actually, the name CEP is derived from “compressed EPS”. Coincidentally, the name in Polish means “the flail”. We hope that <b>others</b> find <b>threshing</b> EPS files useful, in order to get rid of chaff, i. e., redundant data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —This article {{summarizes}} catch {{data for}} sharks collected by fishery observers during two periods (1995 – 2000 and 2004 – 2006) in the Hawaii-based pelagic longline fishery, which targets swordfish Xiphias gladius in the shallow-set sector and bigeye tuna Thunnus obesus in the deep-set sector. The blue shark Prionace glauca was the predominant shark species caught {{throughout the study}} period (84. 5 % of all sharks). Five <b>other</b> species (bigeye <b>thresher</b> Alopias superciliosus, oceanic whitetip shark Carcharhinus longimanus, shortfin mako Isurus oxyrinchus, silky shark C. falciformis, and crocodile shark Pseudocarcharias kamoharai) were relatively common (1. 0 – 4. 1 %). Two major developments affected shark catches in this fishery during the study period. The first was the prohibition in 2000 of shark finning under most circumstances. The second development was that management measures were taken in 2000 and 2001 to protect sea turtles (leatherback sea turtles Dermochelys coriacea and loggerhead sea turtles Caretta caretta) and these measures included a closure of the shallow-set (swordfish-targeting) sector for more than 3 years. The closure caused decreases in shark catches because the shallow-set sector was typically characterized by high catch rates. The shallow-set sector was reopened in 2004. Comparisons of nominal catch per unit effort (number of sharks/ 1, 000 hooks) revealed significant differences in catch rates between the two fishery sectors and the two periods.

Shark take, driven by vast demand for meat and fins, is increasing. We set out to gain {{insights}} into the impact of small-scale longline fisheries in Peru. Onboard observers were used to document catch from 145 longline fishing trips (1668 fishing days) originating from Ilo, southern Peru. Fishing effort is divided into two seasons: targeting dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus; December to February) and sharks (March to November). A total of 16, 610 sharks were observed caught, with 11, 166 identified to species level. Of these, 70. 6 % were blue sharks (Prionace glauca), 28. 4 % short-fin mako sharks (Isurus oxyrinchus), and 1 % were <b>other</b> species (including <b>thresher</b> (Alopias vulpinus), hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena), porbeagle (Lamnus nasus), and other Carcharhinidae species (Carcharhinus brachyurus, Carcharhinus falciformis, Galeorhinus galeus). Mean ± SD catch per unit effort of 33. 6 ± 10. 9 sharks per 1000 hooks was calculated for the shark season and 1. 9 ± 3. 1 sharks per 1000 hooks were caught in the dolphinfish season. An average of 83. 7 % of sharks caught (74. 7 % blue sharks; 93. 3 % mako sharks) were deemed sexually immature and under the legal minimum landing size, which for species exhibiting k-selected life history traits can result in susceptibility to over exploitation. As these growing fisheries operate along the entire Peruvian coast and may catch millions of sharks per annum, we conclude that their continued expansion, along with ineffective legislative approaches resulting in removal of immature individuals, has the potential to threaten the sustainability of the fishery, its target species, and ecosystem. There is a need for additional monitoring and research to inform novel management strategies for sharks while maintaining fisher livelihoods. We would like to thank the members of the fishing communities who participated in this study, in particular the fishers who were willing to have an observer onboard.

40|$|International audienceSince the 1980 s, ‘‘strange'' microwear traces {{were found}} to occur on flint blades from sites in the Near East from the late Neolithic and {{occurring}} in great abundance by the Early Bronze Age. Although these were considered by archaeologists to be sickles because they had visible gloss on their edges, their use-traces could not be reproduced in harvesting experiments {{carried out in the}} field. Subsequently, several lines of evidence were used to study the blades, including not only direct observation of microscopic wear traces, but also Near Eastern cuneiform texts from the third and second millennium BC describing agricultural instruments and analogy with ethnographic and experimental reference material. We found that these tools and their traces best matched traces on flint used to arm the underside of a tribulum (threshing sledge) for threshing grain and cutting straw. We built a replica of the tribulum described in cuneiform texts from the Bronze Age, using copies of the Bronze Age blades, and used this instrument in experiments. The publication of S. A. Semenov's work concerning traceology of ancient implements [S. A. Semenov, Prehistoric Technology (M. W. Thompson, Trans.), Cory, Adams and Mackay, London, 1964] awakened considerable interest in the possibilities of directly inferring tool function from the microscopic traces left by use on ancient implements. However, the goal and purpose of microwear studies is to reconstruct, as completely as possible, the economic activities of prehistoric groups, requiring a methodology that embraces all aspects relevant to the interpretation of microwear traces [L. Keeley, The methodology of microwear analysis : a comment on Nance. American Antiquity 39 (1974) 126 - 128]. In this study, we apply the science of tribology, which studies the friction and the wear of solid bodies in contact, to the threshing sledge and its blades. Tribological analysis of the tribulum has thus far provided new explanations for the formation of traces of wear on flint inserts in threshing sledges, while also revealing features on a far smaller scale, involving the role of a film deposit. We determine the mechanisms by which the tribulum threshes grain, and, particularly, fine-cuts straw from the sheaves of cereal laid on the threshing floor. The superior functioning of the tribulum compared to <b>other</b> methods of <b>threshing</b> and cutting straw is due to its great control of the rheologyethe deformation and floweof the straw layer on the threshing floor. The study lead to insights as to the mastery, of what may be considered today to be complex tribological principles, in the Bronze Age and probably beginning in the Late Neolithic [P. C.

40|$|Despite good {{crop yields}} the Sahel {{continues}} to import cereals {{to the detriment}} of its own farming. The availability of international suspluses of cereal products at relatively low costs, from the North, erratic crop yields in the South, the difficulties experienced by develop. ing countries in processing local cereals, and finally - the labour-intensive methods of preparation based on millet, maize or sorghum compared to the simplicity of cooking rice or making wheat bread, all contribute to this state of affairs. In 1988 the rainy season was good in the Sahel, and cereal production rose to an unprecedented level - about 9, 213, 000 tonnes according to CILSS (Comite Inter-Etats de Lutte contre la Secheresse au Sahel), which is a rise of 3 % on the previous harvest. Nevertheless, cereal imports {{do not seem to be}} decreasing 1, 017, 000 tonnes of rice and wheat will be brought into the Sahel this year, whether by commercial importation or food aid programmes. The question of nutritional self-sufficiency in the Sahel is thus not linked to rainfall alone: this propensity towards imported cereals is also accounted for by the higher quality of imports, their adaptation to the needs of consumers today, and to their competitive price. Eighty representatives of the Sahelian countries (from Burkina Faso, the Gambia, Mali, and Senegal) met at Thies in Senegal in October 1988 to try and resolve the problem. The meeting was on the initiative of CILSS and the Club du Sahel, with the collaboration of ENDA Third World and GRET (Groupe de Recherches et d'Etudes Techniques), and it set in motion a prograrnme promoting local cereals in the Sahel (PROCELOS). This programme is one of two reassuring moves: the first shows that, according to recent research, products from local cereals have a good reputation with Sahelian consumers. Furthermore, new dietary habits (mainly in towns) do not necessarily involve imports: new products can be supplied based on local cereals. Offering new products In the past 20 years, imports of wheat and rice have risen from about one-eighth to one quarter of the total cereal consumption in Sahelian countries. In order to reverse this trend certain measures must be taken it is possible, for example, to adapt local cereals to current preferences by appropriate marketing strategies for both > traditional products and for new products. It is also possible to get public authorities and funding organizations to distribute recipes for new dishes using local products in canteens and local communities. Encouraging the manufacture of products made up of local cereal flour compounds (biscuits, baby cereal, bread [...] .) should be one of the main aspects of the programme, and as experiments carried out in Senegal have been very positive. But these measures cannot be seen as sufficient. All the Sahelian states must take part as must all those who form part of the cereals network. No lasting success will be seen until a macro-economic climate which favours the promotion of local cereals has been created. To this end the donor countries must also bring into being a sort of food aid code of conduct: for example, if surplus cereals are being brought in to help areas in short supply, European surpluses should be limited Financial measures, too, can also play an important role. Small local manufacturers and businessmen will be attracted to the use and processing of local cereals if their tax position is both clarified and eased. It is for the funding agencies to make new commitments to keep the cereals markets ir~formation systems going, and to finance campaigns to promote products made of local cereals. As for the processing equipment needed, the machinery does exist, even if much of it needs to be adapted. The enormous variety of plant used over such a wide area and the significant regional differences present enormous difficulties so the PROCELOS programme recommends that each country standardizes its equipment in order to make maintenance and the supply of spare parts easier. It is also possible and desirable to manufacture <b>threshing</b> and husking <b>machinery</b> and grain mills locally. For instance, in Senegal good results have been obtained notably with the small-scale manufacture of hammer-mills which are cheap yet effective. This is still time to correct the situation, and if the recommendations of the programme are followed, the objectives can and will be attained. The final message from the meeting which drew up the PROCELOS programme was Eat African!
