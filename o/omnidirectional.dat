5|$|In 1964 Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson serendipitously {{discovered}} the cosmic background radiation, an <b>omnidirectional</b> signal {{in the microwave}} band. Their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the big-bang predictions by Alpher, Herman and Gamow around 1950. Through the 1970s the radiation {{was found to be}} approximately consistent with a black body spectrum in all directions; this spectrum has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe, and today corresponds to approximately 2.725K. This tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, and Penzias and Wilson were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1978.|$|E
5|$|The AW101's {{navigation}} system includes a GPS receiver and inertial {{navigation system}}, VHF <b>omnidirectional</b> radio range (VOR), {{instrument landing system}} (ILS), TACAN, and automatic direction finding. The Mk1 and Mk3 are equipped with a Doppler velocity system (DVS) which provides relative ground velocities; the DVS is also linked into the AFCS {{as part of the}} autostabilisation system. For safety, the aircraft is equipped with obstacle and terrain avoidance warning systems, traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), and both voice and flight data recorders.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Hornets {{were very}} similar to the {{standard}} USNavy variants, but incorporated a number of minor modifications. These included the addition of an Instrument Landing System/Very High Frequency <b>Omnidirectional</b> Range (ILS/VOR) system, a high-frequency radio, a different ejection seat harness and the deletion of all equipment used only to launch the aircraft from catapults. In addition, two of the Australian aircraft were fitted with flight-test instrumentation so that they could be used as part of trials.|$|E
5|$|Each {{battery-powered}} vehicle, or AGV, {{is made up}} of two platforms. Riders sit on {{the upper}} platform, which provides three degrees of freedom. A lower platform provides <b>omnidirectional</b> lateral movement. Unlike previous ride designs, the trackless system and the wheel and motor configurations allow movements diagonal to a rider's perspective. The vehicles use a dead reckoning system developed by Frog AGV to navigate their way through the environment, allowing a vehicle to cross another's path. Each vehicle features a built-in controller, which wirelessly communicates with a central ride-system controller. Movement commands are issued by the ride-system controller, and executed by the vehicles' controllers. A specially-designed battery and charge system allow the vehicles to be quickly charged while docked at the loading and unloading platforms.|$|E
5|$|The {{autopilot}} {{system used}} at the time had four basic control modes: HEADING, VOR/LOC, ILS, and INS. The HEADING mode maintained a constant magnetic course selected by the pilot. The VOR/LOC mode maintained the plane on a specific course, transmitted from a VOR (VHF <b>omnidirectional</b> range, a type of short-range radio signal transmitted from ground beacons) or Localizer (LOC) beacon selected by the pilot. The ILS (instrument landing system) mode caused the plane to track both vertical and lateral course beacons, {{which led to a}} specific runway selected by the pilot. The INS (inertial navigation system) mode maintained the plane on lateral course lines between selected flight plan waypoints programmed into the INS computer.|$|E
5|$|The captain {{asked for}} the descent {{checklist}} at 20:24:24. The fasten seat belt sign was switched on and the flight attendant started the process of preparing the cabin for landing. At 20:24:46 the captain, {{as part of the}} checklist, informed the first officer that they would go down to 1,500 ft at Torghatten and then down to 550ft. This was followed first by a partially unreadable conversation between the captain and the first officers, which included if they were to fill fuel, and then an unreadable conversation between the captain and the jump seat passenger. The direction of the VHF <b>omnidirectional</b> radio range (VOR) and distance measuring equipment (DME) at Brønnøysund was checked at 20:26:37.|$|E
5|$|To keep low {{frequency}} sound {{focused on the}} audience area {{and not on the}} stage, and to keep low frequencies from bothering people outside of the event space, a variety of techniques have been developed in concert sound to turn the naturally <b>omnidirectional</b> radiation of subwoofers into a more directional pattern. Several examples of sound reinforcement system applications where sound engineers seek to provide more directional bass sound are music festivals, which often have several bands performing at the same time on different stages; large raves or EDM events, where there are multiple DJs performing {{at the same time in}} different rooms or stages; and multiplex movie theatres, in which there are many films being shown simultaneously in auditoriums that share common walls. These techniques include setting up subwoofers in a vertical array; using combinations of delay and polarity inversion; and setting up a delay-shaded system. With a cardioid dispersion pattern, two end-fire subwoofers can be placed one in front of the other. The enclosure nearest the listener is delayed by a few milliseconds The second subwoofer is delayed a precise amount corresponding to the time it takes sound to traverse the distance between speaker grilles.|$|E
25|$|Many {{hearing aids}} now have both an <b>omni{{directional}}</b> and a directional microphone mode. This {{is because the}} wearer may not need or desire the noise-reducing properties of the directional microphone in a given situation. Typically, the <b>omnidirectional</b> microphone mode is used in quiet listening situations (e.g. living room) whereas the directional microphone is used in noisy listening situations (e.g. restaurant). The microphone mode is typically selected manually by the wearer. Some hearing aids automatically switch the microphone mode.|$|E
25|$|Most older {{hearing aids}} have only an <b>omnidirectional</b> {{microphone}}. An <b>omnidirectional</b> microphone amplifies sounds equally from all directions. In contrast, a directional microphone amplifies sounds from one direction more than sounds from other directions. This means that sounds originating {{from the direction}} the system is steered toward are amplified more than sounds coming from other directions. If the desired speech arrives {{from the direction of}} steering and the noise is from a different direction, then compared to an <b>omnidirectional</b> microphone, a directional microphone provides a better signal to noise ratio. Improving the signal-to-noise ratio improves speech understanding in noise. Directional microphones {{have been found to be}} the second best method to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (the best method was an FM system, which locates the microphone near the mouth of the desired talker).|$|E
25|$|<b>Omnidirectional</b> treadmills {{such as the}} Wizdish RoVR, Virtuix Omni & Cyberith Virtualizer can be used {{to capture}} the users {{locomotion}} as they walk or run.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{an array}} {{is made up}} of <b>omnidirectional</b> {{microphones}} distributed about the perimeter of a space, linked to a computer that records and interprets the results into a coherent form.|$|E
25|$|Communications {{depends on}} an <b>omnidirectional</b> low-gain antenna {{communicating}} {{at a low}} data rate and a steerable high-gain antenna, both {{in direct contact with}} Earth. A low gain antenna is also used to relay data to spacecraft orbiting Mars.|$|E
25|$|Measurement {{microphones}} {{are generally}} scalar sensors of pressure; they exhibit an <b>omnidirectional</b> response, {{limited only by}} the scattering profile of their physical dimensions. Sound intensity or sound power measurements require pressure-gradient measurements, which are typically made using arrays {{of at least two}} microphones, or with hot-wire anemometers.|$|E
25|$|While at Rugby, the {{transmitter}} generated 60kW of {{radio frequency power}} (using 70kW of mains power). The 180m-high T-aerial antenna was 500m across at its top. The vertical part of the antenna radiated the signal, so that the received strength was similar in all directions (it was approximately <b>omnidirectional).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{basic system}} mode is for rocket detection, since a rocket launch gives a bright flare. In basic operation, RLS has {{electro-optical}} systems on three towers, separated by 2 to 3 kilometers, to give <b>omnidirectional</b> coverage. The tower equipment {{connects to the}} control stations using a wireless network.|$|E
25|$|Both {{electro-optical}} and radar sensors {{have been}} coupled with acoustic sensors in modern counter-artillery systems. Electro-optical sensors are directional and precise, so {{need to be}} cued by acoustic or other <b>omnidirectional</b> sensors. The original Canadian sensors, in the First World War, used electro-optical flash as well as geophysical sound sensors.|$|E
25|$|Soviet {{scientists}} took {{a strong}} interest in SETI during the 1960s and performed a number of searches with <b>omnidirectional</b> antennas in the hope of picking up powerful radio signals. Soviet astronomer Iosif Shklovsky wrote the pioneering book in the field, Universe, Life, Intelligence (1962), which was expanded upon by American astronomer Carl Sagan as the best-selling book Intelligent Life in the Universe (1966).|$|E
25|$|In the {{telecommunications}} field, a unique impediment to {{development in the}} central Allegheny region is the United States National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ), a large rectangle of land—about —that straddles the border area of Virginia and West Virginia. Created in 1958 by the Federal Communications Commission, the NRQZ severely restricts all <b>omnidirectional</b> and high-power radio transmissions, although cell phone service is allowed {{throughout much of the}} area.|$|E
25|$|Mainlobe jamming can {{generally}} only {{be reduced}} by narrowing the mainlobe solid angle and cannot fully be eliminated when directly facing a jammer which uses the same frequency and polarization as the radar. Sidelobe jamming can be overcome by reducing receiving sidelobes in the radar antenna design and by using an <b>omnidirectional</b> antenna to detect and disregard non-mainlobe signals. Other anti-jamming techniques are frequency hopping and polarization.|$|E
25|$|Following initial {{studies and}} wind-tunnel testing at the Air Proving Ground Center and Arnold Engineering Development Center, a radically {{unconventional}} design emerged that featured a lenticular, wedge-shaped airframe. The lenticular design {{was considered to}} have the best handling characteristics at extremely high angles of attack, and would theoretically possess ideal mass distribution, giving the missile outstanding terminal agility. In addition, the lenticular design allowed for <b>omnidirectional</b> launching from the carrying aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatiques (Colored Landscape with Aquatic Birds) is an oil {{painting}} created circa 1907 by the French artist and theorist Jean Metzinger. Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatiques is a Proto-Cubist work executed in a Post-Divisionist style {{with a unique}} Fauve-like palette. Metzinger's broad <b>omnidirectional</b> brushstrokes {{in the treatment of}} surfaces render homage to Paul Cézanne, while the luscious subtropical imagery in the painting are an homage to Paul Gauguin and Metzinger's friend Henri Rousseau.|$|E
25|$|Despite their similarities, works {{produced}} by divers artists were neither homogeneous nor isotropic. This venture was essentially nonlinear. Cubism was <b>omnidirectional,</b> growing {{like a tree}} with many branches. The progression of each artist was unique. Even when paths would cross, artists would not necessarily fall under one another's influence. Despite a growing awareness, a 'collective consciousness' based on a nonacademic passion for structure and mobility, and despite the sense of group unity that would attain a maxima circa 1912, deep-seated differences arose sporadically, often fueled by critics and dealers.|$|E
25|$|Early systems {{tended to}} use <b>omnidirectional</b> {{broadcast}} antennas, with directional receiver antennas which were pointed in various directions. For instance, the first {{system to be}} deployed, Chain Home, used two straight antennas at right angles for reception, each on a different display. The maximum return would be detected with an antenna {{at right angles to}} the target, and a minimum with the antenna pointed directly at it (end on). The operator could determine the direction to a target by rotating the antenna so one display showed a maximum while the other showed a minimum.|$|E
25|$|Dashew {{moved into}} the area of {{offshore}} oil loading in the 1960s, and {{was instrumental in the}} creation of the single-point mooring systems used in modern terminals, as well as the <b>omnidirectional</b> thrusters used to maneuver the ships up to the moors. As a part of these developments, Dashew became interested in using similar offshore mooring to handle bulk freight as well, especially container shipping which was rapidly dominating the industry. After consulting with experts in the automated warehousing field for several months, he incorporated the Dashveyor Company in 1963 in California to develop these ideas.|$|E
25|$|Braathens {{introduced}} {{their new}} Fokker F27 Friendship from 9 January 1959. From the summer program it flew two daily flights to Oslo and from 1961 twice per {{day on the}} coastal route. VHF <b>omnidirectional</b> range and distance measuring equipment navigational system were installed in 1963. Ålesund Airport experienced a massive increase in traffic during the 1960s. A third daily departure to Oslo was introduced in August 1963 and on the coastal route from 2 May 1964. The latter was extended to Bodø Airport and Tromsø Airport from 1 April 1967, and upgraded to a fourth daily service. Some Oslo services were provided using a Douglas DC-6. A year later the coastal route increased to five daily trips, which was matched by the Oslo route in 1969. That year also saws the installation of a visual approach slope indicator {{and the introduction of}} the Fokker F28 Fellowship in March.|$|E
25|$|An amateur {{radio station}} {{installed}} in a vehicle {{is referred to as}} a mobile station. A typical mobile station is equipped with a transceiver, one or more antennas, and a microphone. The transceiver may be specially designed for installation in vehicles. It may be much smaller than transceivers designed for fixed station use, to facilitate installation under a seat or in a trunk, and it may feature a detachable control head that can be mounted in a separate location {{from the rest of the}} radio. Antennas designed for mobile stations must accommodate the unique physical constraints of the vehicle and travel lanes which it occupies, allowing for clearance under overpasses and bridges, and safe passage by vehicles in adjacent lanes. Most antennas used in mobile stations are <b>omnidirectional.</b> Few mobile stations are equipped to communicate with Morse code or digital modes. Most mobile stations are designed to be operated by the vehicle operator while driving.|$|E
25|$|Condenser {{microphones}} {{span the}} range from telephone transmitters through inexpensive karaoke microphones to high-fidelity recording microphones. They generally produce a high-quality audio signal {{and are now}} the popular choice in laboratory and recording studio applications. The inherent suitability of this technology {{is due to the}} very small mass that must be moved by the incident sound wave, unlike other microphone types that require the sound wave to do more work. They require a power source, provided either via microphone inputs on equipment as phantom power or from a small battery. Power is necessary for establishing the capacitor plate voltage, and is also needed to power the microphone electronics (impedance conversion in the case of electret and DC-polarized microphones, demodulation or detection in the case of RF/HF microphones). Condenser microphones are also available with two diaphragms that can be electrically connected to provide a range of polar patterns (see below), such as cardioid, <b>omnidirectional,</b> and figure-eight. It is also possible to vary the pattern continuously with some microphones, for example the Røde NT2000 or CAD M179.|$|E
25|$|The inner {{elements}} of a microphone are {{the primary source of}} differences in directivity. A pressure microphone uses a diaphragm between a fixed internal volume of air and the environment, and responds uniformly to pressure from all directions, so it is said to be <b>omnidirectional.</b> A pressure-gradient microphone uses a diaphragm that is at least partially open on both sides. The pressure difference between the two sides produces its directional characteristics. Other elements such as the external shape of the microphone and external devices such as interference tubes can also alter a microphone's directional response. A pure pressure-gradient microphone is equally sensitive to sounds arriving from front or back, but insensitive to sounds arriving from the side because sound arriving at the front and back at the same time creates no gradient between the two. The characteristic directional pattern of a pure pressure-gradient microphone is like a figure-8. Other polar patterns are derived by creating a capsule that combines these two effects in different ways. The cardioid, for instance, features a partially closed backside, so its response is a combination of pressure and pressure-gradient characteristics.|$|E
25|$|One simple {{combination}} is two simple sources {{separated by a}} distance and vibrating out of phase, one miniature sphere expanding while the other is contracting. The pair {{is known as a}} doublet, or dipole, and the radiation of this {{combination is}} similar to that of a very small dynamic loudspeaker operating without a baffle. The directivity of a dipole is a figure 8 shape with maximum output along a vector that connects the two sources and minimums to the sides when the observing point is equidistant from the two sources, where the sum of the positive and negative waves cancel each other. While most drivers are dipoles, depending on the enclosure to which they are attached, they may radiate as monopoles, dipoles (or bipoles). If mounted on a finite baffle, and these out of phase waves are allowed to interact, dipole peaks and nulls in the frequency response result. When the rear radiation is absorbed or trapped in a box, the diaphragm becomes a monopole radiator. Bipolar speakers, made by mounting in-phase monopoles (both moving out of or into the box in unison) on opposite sides of a box, are a method of approaching <b>omnidirectional</b> radiation patterns.|$|E
500|$|The low-frequency {{radio range}} (LFR), {{also known as}} the four-course radio range, LF/MF four-course radio range, A-N radio range, Adcock radio range, or {{commonly}} [...] "the range", was the main navigation system used by aircraft for instrument flying in the 1930s and 1940s, until the advent of the VHF <b>omnidirectional</b> range (VOR), beginning in the late 1940s. It was used for en route navigation as well as instrument approaches and holds.|$|E
500|$|Each {{transmitter}} {{is connected}} to a dedicated antenna, which has a height corresponding to approximately one-half of its signal's wavelength, and the signal radiation patterns from each antenna are <b>omnidirectional.</b> [...] The top half of each antenna tower contains a quarter-wavelength radiating element, and the bottom half uses nine guy wires, connected to {{the midpoint of the}} tower and sloped at one-to-one from the ground—with a length of [...] times the wavelength—as additional radiating elements.|$|E
500|$|The Federal Aviation Administration has {{operated}} a [...] tall {{very high frequency}} <b>omnidirectional</b> range (VOR) aviation tower on Upper Table Rock since the 1960s. The tower's purpose is to broadcast precise coordinates to nearby aircraft to assist in navigation. The facility is {{closed to the public}} due to the threat to the safety of the occupants of the aircraft. However, the structure sustained $40,000 damage in 1997 when vandals unsuccessfully attempted to steal aluminum antennas from the [...] tall fiberglass shell {{on the roof of the}} building.|$|E
500|$|RCA's Studio B had {{recently}} been equipped with a new three-track recorder. To further improve the recording of Presley's voice, Porter had Telefunken U-47 microphones placed in the studio. The U-47 was the first condenser microphone that could switch between <b>omnidirectional</b> and cardioid patterns. The microphone {{could be used for}} vocals, instruments and full area coverage. The first song recorded was Otis Blackwell's [...] "Make Me Know It", which was mastered in nineteen takes. [...] "Soldier Boy" [...] was later recorded in fifteen takes, followed by the non-album cuts [...] "Stuck on You" [...] and [...] "Fame and Fortune". The last song recorded during the March session was a non-album cut, [...] "A Mess of Blues". A new session was arranged for April. Presley then left for Miami, Florida, where he taped [...]|$|E
500|$|Tobin's sixth studio album, Foley Room, was {{released}} in 2007. The title alludes to the [...] "foley rooms" [...] used by recording engineers and foley artists to record sound effects in the movie industry. On this album, Tobin concluded his transition away from prerecorded source material that started with Out From Out Where. All of the samples used for production were recorded by himself using an <b>omnidirectional</b> microphone. Recorded primarily in Montreal, San Francisco, and Seattle, the samples came {{from a wide range}} of sources including motorbikes, tigers, insects, and water falling from a tap. Also contributing to the album were the string quartet Kronos Quartet, drummer Stefan Schneider, and harpist Sarah Pagé. Foley Rooms use of field-recordings was used to help promote the album, including two official pre-release trailers posted to YouTube. Nate Dorr of PopMatters.com called it a [...] "smooth, natural progression" [...] from his work on Supermodified. The first single, [...] "Bloodstone", {{was released}} to the iTunes Music Store months before the rest of the album. Ninja Tune also published a DVD titled Foley Room: Found Footage which documented the recording process.|$|E
500|$|Flight {{attendant}} CeeCee Lyles {{called her}} husband at 09:47:57 and left him a message saying the plane had been hijacked. Marion Britton called her friend, Fred Fiumano, at 09:49:12. Fiumano recalled, [...] "she said, 'We're gonna. They're gonna kill us, you know, We're gonna die.' And I told her, 'Don't worry, they hijacked the plane, they're gonna take you for a ride, you go to their country, and you come back. You stay there for vacation.' You don't know what to say—what are you gonna say? I kept on saying the same things, 'Be calm.' And she was crying and—you know—more or less crying and screaming and yelling." [...] Flight attendant Sandra Bradshaw called {{her husband at}} 09:50:04 and {{told him she was}} preparing scalding water to throw at the hijackers. Passenger Lauren Grandcolas called her husband twice, once before takeoff and once during the hijacking. He missed both of her calls. She then passed her phone to Honor Elizabeth Wainio. Wainio called her stepmother at 09:53:43 and concluded, four and a half minutes later, by saying, [...] "I have to go. They're breaking into the cockpit. I love you." [...] Jarrah dialed in the VHF <b>omnidirectional</b> range (VOR) frequency for the VOR navigational aid at Reagan National Airport at 09:55:11 to direct the plane toward Washington, D.C. Bradshaw, on the phone with her husband, said [...] "Everyone is running up to first class. I've got to go. Bye." [...] Beamer told Jefferson that the group was planning to [...] "jump on" [...] the hijackers and fly the plane into the ground before the hijackers' plan could be followed through. Beamer recited the Lord's Prayer and the 23rd Psalm with Jefferson, prompting others to join in. Beamer requested of Jefferson, [...] "If I don't make it, please call my family and let them know how much I love them." [...] After this, Jefferson heard muffled voices and Beamer clearly answering, [...] "Are you ready? Okay. Let's roll." [...] These were Beamer's last words to Jefferson.|$|E
