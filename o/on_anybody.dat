5|$|While fleeing, Stan {{calls his}} mother, who is too busy protesting Terrance and Phillip {{to listen to}} his problems. More than a dozen people have killed {{themselves}} against the headquarters building. Eventually, the network agrees to take the show off the air, not because of the deaths but because of the stench of the protesters' explosive diarrhea. Meanwhile, Death continues chasing the boys, but stops in front of a television playing Terrance and Phillip. Death and the boys start laughing together, but after it is taken off the air, Death angrily touches and kills Kenny. Angered, Grandpa Marvin demands that Death kill him, but Death refuses. Death then brings in the spirit of Stan's great great grandfather (Marvin's grandfather), who was killed by Marvin when he was Stan's age; the ghost warns Marvin that he must die of natural causes and not place the burden of his suicide <b>on</b> <b>anybody</b> else's shoulders or else he will spend his eternity after death in limbo.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode title}} is a humorous {{reference}} to the phrase [...] "jumping the shark", coined when Fonzie did a water ski jump of a shark pen on Happy Days, {{which is used to}} describe shows that have made a desperate attempt to regain viewership after they have reached their peak and started to decline in quality. Executive producer Chris Carter said that the title was tongue-in-cheek, and further stated that it was their [...] "way of lowering the boom <b>on</b> <b>anybody</b> who thought that it did". He further stated that the series was [...] "good" [...] until the end, even after the departure of David Duchovny as Fox Mulder. According to IGN, the episode's title was a homage to the popular website Jump the Shark.

500|$|While {{the designs}} of Homer's new art friends were not based <b>on</b> <b>anybody</b> in particular, the [...] "German guy" [...] was drawn to hold his {{cigarette}} in a [...] "European way" [...] by animation director Jim Reardon. When visiting the Springfield museum, Homer and Marge see a painting showing Akbar and Jeff, two characters from The Simpsons creator Matt Groening's comic strip Life in Hell. The painting's frame was also signed by Groening himself in real life. The painting next to Groening's was drawn by Scully's friend Tom Gagnon, who is an artist. Some of the paintings in the episode's second act were also drawn by friends of Dean Moore. At one point in Homer's dream, the Vitruvian Man appears and attacks him. According to Groening, there were [...] "some controversy" [...] {{over whether or not}} the Vitruvian Man would be in nude or not, as he is in the original painting. In the episode, he is wearing a jockstrap. At the end of the episode, Springfield is flooded with water, and Marge is seen painting a picture on the Simpsons' roof. Her painting was drawn by staff animator Amy Clese, who drew it as a recreation of a painting by J. M. W. Turner, an English Romantic painter. According to Dean Moore, the painting was [...] "pretty difficult" [...] to animate, as it was drawn with a lot of washes and gradients. He added, however, that he was [...] "very happy" [...] with it.|$|E

[...] The song [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was having trouble with the vocals at practice, when Vedder stepped in.

Delegates raised red-and-white vertical [...] "Edwards" [...] banners and chanted his name. The theme of Edwards's address was the divide between the [...] "two Americas," [...] his populist message throughout the primary campaign and now one embraced by Kerry. He tied the division to his own roots in North Carolina, and introduced his family to the audience. Edwards addressed his parents from the podium: [...] "You taught me the values that I carry in my heart: faith, family, responsibility, opportunity for everyone. You taught me that there's dignity and honor in a hard day's work.

The Guatemalans offered to sponsor any campaign that Morazán wanted at that point. [...] Morazán helped Los Altos and appointed Mariano Rivera Paz, who {{was close to the}} Aycinena family; however he did not return to the former aristocrats any of their confiscated possessions. In return, Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol, leader of the family voted in favor of dissolving the Central American Federation, thus forcing Morazán to return to El Salvador to try to save what was left of his presidential powers.

2500|$|Most importantly, through Shakespeare, Melville infused Moby-Dick with a {{power of}} {{expression}} he had not previously possessed. Reading Shakespeare, Matthiessen observes, had been [...] "a catalytic agent" [...] for Melville, one that transformed his writing [...] "from limited reporting to the expression of profound natural forces". The extent to which Melville was in full possession of his powers is demonstrated by Matthiessen through the description of Ahab, which ends in language [...] "that suggests Shakespeare's but is not an imitation of it: 'Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked from the skies and dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied air!' The imaginative richness of the final phrase seems particularly Shakespearean, [...] "but its two key words appear only once each in the plays... and to neither of these usages is Melville indebted for his fresh combination." [...] Melville's assimilation of Shakespeare, Matthiessen concludes, gave Moby-Dick [...] "a kind of diction that depended upon no source", and that could, as D.H. Lawrence put it, convey something [...] "almost superhuman or inhuman, bigger than life." [...] The prose is not based <b>on</b> <b>anybody</b> else's verse but on [...] "a sense of speech rhythm".|$|E
2500|$|Melville owned an {{edition of}} Shakespeare's works by 1849, and his reading of it greatly {{influenced}} {{the style of}} his next book, Moby-Dick (1851). The critic F.O. Matthiessen found that the language of Shakespeare far surpasses other influences upon the book, in that it inspired Melville to discover his own full strength. On almost every page, debts to Shakespeare can be discovered. The [...] "mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing" [...] {{at the end of}} [...] "Cetology" [...] (Ch.32) echo the famous phrase in Macbeth: [...] "Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury/ Signifying nothing." [...] Ahab's first extended speech to the crew, in the [...] "Quarter-Deck" [...] (Ch.36) is practically blank verse and so is Ahab's soliloquy at the beginning of [...] "Sunset" [...] (Ch.37):'I leave a white and turbid wake;/ Pale waters, paler cheeks, where'er I sail./ The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm/ My track; let them; but first I pass.' Through Shakespeare, Melville infused Moby-Dick with a power of expression he had not previously possessed. Reading Shakespeare had been [...] "a catalytic agent" [...] for Melville, one that transformed his writing from merely reporting to [...] "the expression of profound natural forces." [...] The extent to which Melville assimilated Shakespeare is evident in the description of Ahab, Matthiessen continues, which ends in language that seems Shakespearean yet is no imitation: 'Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked from the skies and dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied air!' The imaginative richness of the final phrase seems particularly Shakespearean, [...] "but its two key words appear only once each in the plays...and to neither of these usages is Melville indebted for his fresh combination."

60|$|That {{there is}} no 'effect of light' here arrived at, I beg you at once to observe as a most {{important}} lesson. The subject is St. Francis challenging the Soldan's Magi,--fire-worshippers--to pass with him through the fire, which is blazing red at his feet. It is so hot that the two Magi {{on the other side}} of the throne shield their faces. But it is represented simply as a red mass of writhing forms of flame; and casts no firelight whatever. There is no ruby colour <b>on</b> <b>anybody's</b> nose: there are no black shadows under anybody's chin; there are no Rembrandtesque gradations of gloom, or glitterings of sword-hilt and armour.|$|R
