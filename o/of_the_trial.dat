40|$|Sodium-glucose cotransporter- 2 (SGLT 2) inhibitors are a {{new class}} of {{medicines}} approved recently for <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> type 2 diabetes. To improve <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> randomized clinical <b>trial</b> (RCT) reports, <b>the</b> Consolidated Standards <b>of</b> Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement for methodological features was created. For achieving our objective in this study, we assessed <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> methodological reporting of RCTs of SGLT 2 inhibitors according to the 2010 CONSORT statement. We reviewed and analyzed <b>the</b> methodology <b>of</b> SGLT 2 inhibitors RCTs that were approved by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA). <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 27 <b>trials,</b> participants, eligibility criteria, and additional analyses were reported in 100 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials.</b> In addition, trial design, interventions, and statistical methods were reported in 96. 3 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials.</b> Outcomes were reported in 93. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials.</b> Settings were reported in 85. 2 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials.</b> Blinding and sample size were reported in 66. 7 and 59. 3 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials,</b> respectively.

Overall, fewer dip estimates were given in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1.

30|$|Table  3 shows {{consistent}} {{components of}} risk <b>of</b> bias across <b>the</b> <b>trials,</b> including performance and detection bias due to inadequate blinding in all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials,</b> and selection bias {{due to a}} lack of transparency regarding sequence generation in most trials [12, 51, 52, 55, 56] and of allocation concealment in all trials. There was a lack of blinding of outcome measurement, with evidence of injury registration being performed by personnel providing the intervention in all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> included <b>trials</b> in which <b>the</b> injury registration process is reported [12, 50 - 54]. There were also issues regarding blinding of research staff, with staff visiting intervention groups during the study period in two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> [52, 55]. Only one trial had a published protocol demonstrating pre-defined study goals [50], introducing a risk of selective reporting <b>of</b> outcomes in <b>the</b> other <b>trials.</b> Two trials were poorly reported, limiting accurate assessment of their internal validity [55, 56]. A number of trials did not present complete outcome data, using available case analyses rather than including all randomized participants. Three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> had full data on all randomized subjects [52, 55, 56] and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining <b>trials</b> conducted an ITT analysis [12]. A high rate of withdrawals introduced a risk of attrition bias to <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> by Hölmich et al. [53], and <b>the</b> reliability <b>of</b> several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> was impaired by low cohort sizes or evidence of insufficient power [50, 52, 55, 56]. Compliance was poorly reported and, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four <b>trials</b> in which compliance with at least part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intervention is documented [12, 50, 51, 54], lower compliance than pre-defined targets was reported in two [12, 51].|$|R
