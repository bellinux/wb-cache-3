5|$|In addition, isotopic {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>exposed</b> terrestrial rocks {{has demonstrated}} the cosmogenic (cosmic ray) production of 21Ne. This isotope {{is generated by}} spallation reactions on magnesium, sodium, silicon, and aluminium. By analyzing all three isotopes, the cosmogenic component can be resolved from magmatic neon and nucleogenic neon. This suggests that neon will be a useful tool in determining cosmic exposure ages of surface rocks and meteorites.|$|E

5|$|As the {{landscape}} rises, trees become {{smaller and more}} sparse, with stands broken by areas <b>of</b> <b>exposed</b> granite. These include lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, and mountain hemlock that, at highest elevations, give way to vast expanses of granite as treeline is reached. The climate in these habitats is harsh and the growing season is short, but species such as pika, yellow-bellied marmot, white-tailed jackrabbit, Clark's nutcracker, and black rosy finch are adapted to these conditions. Also, the treeless alpine habitats are the areas favored by Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. This species, however, is now found in the Yosemite area only around Tioga Pass, where a small, reintroduced population exists.|$|E
5|$|Hakim {{screened}} {{her first}} {{work as a}} producer, Daun di Atas Bantal (Leaf on a Pillow) during Un Certain Regard at Cannes ten years later. When producing the film, she chose young director Garin Nugroho, whom she perceived to be highly talented; she also took the leading role. During production, she made a mistake that required the reshooting of all footage. In an attempt to cut expenses, she had saved all cans <b>of</b> <b>exposed</b> film to send to the developing lab at once; the lab then notified her that a technical fault with the camera had rendered all of it unusable and that the problem could have been detected earlier had she sent each can as it was filmed.|$|E
5|$|Many Metro {{stations}} {{were designed by}} Chicago architect Harry Weese, and are examples of late-20th century modern architecture. With their heavy use <b>of</b> <b>exposed</b> concrete and repetitive design motifs, Metro stations display aspects of Brutalist design. The stations also reflect the influence of Washington's neoclassical architecture in their overarching coffered ceiling vaults. Weese worked with Cambridge, Massachusetts-based lighting designer Bill Lam on the indirect lighting used throughout the system. All of Metro's original Brutalist stations are found in Downtown Washington, D.C. and neighboring urban corridors of Arlington, Virginia, while newer stations incorporate simplified cost-efficient designs.|$|E

5|$|Sabrina {{was born}} in 1757 in Clerkenwell, London, and was left at the Hospital for the Maintenance and Education <b>of</b> <b>Exposed</b> and Deserted Young Children (more {{commonly}} known as the Foundling Hospital) in London on 24 May 1757 by an anonymous individual. This person left a note explaining that the baby's baptismal name was Manima Butler and that she had been baptised in St James's Church, Clerkenwell. Her name was likely a misspelling of Monimia but there were no baptismal records for any spelling of the name at the parish.|$|E
5|$|The first {{example of}} his final stage {{can be seen in}} a simple but very ingenious building, the Sagrada Família schools, a small school for the workers' children. Built in 1909, it has a {{rectangular}} ground plan of , and contained three classrooms, a vestibule and a chapel. It was built <b>of</b> <b>exposed</b> brick, in three overlapping layers, following the traditional Catalan method. The walls and roof have an undulating shape, giving the structure a sense of lightness but also strength. The Sagrada Família schools have set an example of constructive genius and have served as a source of inspiration for many architects, such is their simplicity, strength, originality, functionality and geometric excellence.|$|E
5|$|Up to {{four million}} people in Vietnam {{were exposed to the}} defoliant, with around one million now {{suffering}} serious health issues. The chemical is capable of damaging genes, resulting in deformities among the offspring <b>of</b> <b>exposed</b> victims. The U.S. government has documented higher cases of leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and various kinds of cancer in exposed veterans. Agent Orange also caused enormous environmental damage in Vietnam. Over 3,100,000 hectares (31,000km2 or 11,969mi2) of forest were defoliated. Defoliants eroded tree cover and seedling forest stock, making reforestation difficult in numerous areas. Animal species diversity sharply reduced in contrast with unsprayed areas.|$|E

5|$|Because {{half the}} country's surface {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>exposed</b> rock, Norway has {{a tradition of}} building mountain cavern halls for many purposes, from tunnels via power plants to sport centers. These often double up as bomb shelters. Gjøvik Municipality opened Norway's first underground swimming pool in 1974. The idea to build an underground ice rink came from Consulting Engineer Jan A. Rygh while having dinner with Municipal Engineer Helge Simenstad in 1988, after the latter said that Gjøvik had been awarded an ice rink for the Olympics. The first drafts were made on a napkin in the restaurant. An alternative proposal for a conventional rink was also made. Among the advantage of a cavern hall was that it would not take up valuable downtown property space or interfere with the town's cityscape, yet it would be centrally located which would reduce travel costs, and there would be a stable year-round natural temperature which would reduce cooling costs.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{carried out}} a second {{commission}} from Eusebi Güell between 1884 and 1887, the Güell Pavilions in Pedralbes, now {{on the outskirts of}} Barcelona. Güell had a country residence in Les Corts de Sarrià, consisting of two adjacent properties known as Can Feliu and Can Cuyàs de la Riera. The architect Joan Martorell had built a Caribbean-style mansion, which was demolished in 1919 {{to make way for the}} Royal Palace of Pedralbes. Gaudí undertook to refurbish the house and construct a wall and porter's lodge. He completed the stone wall with several entrances, the main entrance with an iron gate in the shape of a dragon, with symbology allusive to the myths of Hercules and the Garden of the Hesperides. The buildings consist of a stable, covered longeing ring and porter's lodge: the stable has a rectangular base and catenary arches; the longeing ring has a square base with a hyperboloid dome; the porter's lodge consists of three small buildings, the central one being polygonal with a hyperbolic dome, and the other two smaller and cubic. All three are topped by ventilators in the shape of chimneys faced with ceramics. The walls are <b>of</b> <b>exposed</b> brick in various shades of reds and yellows; in certain sections prefabricated cement blocks are also used. The Pavilions are now the headquarters of the Real Cátedra Gaudí, of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the western}} Mojave Desert, human {{settlement}} and land development {{have led to}} an estimated 16-fold increase in the common raven population over 25 years. Towns, landfills, sewage treatment plants and artificial ponds create sources {{of food and water}} for scavenging birds. Ravens also find nesting sites in utility poles and ornamental trees, and are attracted to roadkill on highways. The explosion in the common raven population in the Mojave has raised concerns for the desert tortoise, a threatened species. Common ravens prey upon juvenile tortoises, which have soft shells and move slowly. Despite this, and there being no danger of extinction, the US Congress added ravens to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 in 1971. Plans to control the population have included shooting and trapping birds, as well as contacting landfill operators to ask that they reduce the amount <b>of</b> <b>exposed</b> garbage. A hunting bounty as a method of control was historically used in Finland from the mid-18th century until 1923. Culling has taken place to a limited extent in Alaska, where the population increase in common ravens is threatening the vulnerable Steller's eider (Polysticta stelleri).|$|E

5|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} encoded {{directly}} by the genetic code {{can be divided into}} several groups based on their properties. Important factors are charge, hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity, size, and functional groups. These properties are important for protein structure and protein–protein interactions. The water-soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues (Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, and Trp) buried {{in the middle of the}} protein, whereas hydrophilic side chains are exposed to the aqueous solvent. (Note that in biochemistry, a residue refers to a specific monomer within the polymeric chain of a polysaccharide, protein or nucleic acid.) The integral membrane proteins tend to have outer rings <b>of</b> <b>exposed</b> hydrophobic amino acids that anchor them into the lipid bilayer. In the case part-way between these two extremes, some peripheral membrane proteins have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane. In similar fashion, proteins that have to bind to positively charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like glutamate and aspartate, while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like lysine and arginine. There are different hydrophobicity scales of amino acid residues.|$|E
5|$|The {{vegetation}} on {{both sides}} of the fjord is High Arctic steppe, which is characterized by grasses. It is caused by extremely low precipitation, basic earth with salt deposits in the surface, and large areas <b>of</b> <b>exposed</b> mineral earth. The area around the fjord has a unique vegetation, which has not preserved in other areas of Svalbard. Along with vegetation found on nesting cliffs, it is the most exclusive flora in Svalbard. There are several unique species in the national park, including , which is featured in the national park's logo and for which Svalbard is the only known location in Europe, Puccinellia svalbardensis, Gentianella tenella and Kobresia simpliciuscula. There is breeding ground for pink-footed goose within the park, although Svalbard ptarmigan can also be found. Animals that can be found in the park include polar bear, Svalbard reindeer and Arctic fox.|$|E
