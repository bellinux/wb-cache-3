They also tend to apply the tax laws under the most favorable conditions. It is the aim <b>of</b> <b>taxpayers</b> to pay the tax in the amount that is smaller than its real value, or not to pay it at all. Payment of tax causes reduction in economic power <b>of</b> <b>taxpayers</b> and deterioration <b>of</b> their economic status. By avoiding tax payment tax payers illegally reduce their tax liability. However, these actions reduce public funds that are formed by collecting taxes. The object {{of this paper is to}} influence the consciousness <b>of</b> <b>taxpayers</b> and to point out that the process of tax evasion usually leads to a redistribution of the tax burden in society in relation to the burden which was predicted by the legislator, because of the fact that the person who is supposed to be a taxpayer avoids to pay taxes. Tax evasion is a serious social problem, it destroys economic sphere of society and causes disturbance in the economic system...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the {{analysis}} of the impact of income tax on individuals selected group <b>of</b> <b>taxpayers.</b> The aim is to evaluate the tax burden <b>of</b> <b>taxpayers</b> and tax progressivity of the income tax of individuals.

The first variable is the amount <b>of</b> income the <b>taxpayer.</b> For the thesis are chosen four different level of monthly gross wages <b>of</b> the <b>taxpayer.</b> The second variable is the social situation of the household in which the taxpayer breadwinner. For this variable also identifies four different scenarios. Both variables are in different model situa-tions present in combination. Progressivity of the income tax is measured by the index of tax progressivity. This index reflects the progression of the tax in a particular point. The key finding from the work suggests that the impact <b>of</b> taxes on <b>taxpayers</b> is different ac-cording to the amount <b>of</b> the <b>taxpayer's</b> income. Level <b>of</b> income is a main element influencing the impact of taxes on the <b>taxpayer.</b> Burden <b>of</b> <b>taxpayers</b> with higher incomes are dispro-portionately higher than the burden <b>of</b> <b>taxpayers</b> with lower incomes. This is primarily due tax progressivity. When assessing the tax progressivity this phenomenon was confirmed. The results of the cal-culations of tax progressivity implies that the tax progressivity is much higher for taxpayers with lower incomes.
