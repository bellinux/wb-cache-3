5|$|Female moths are {{attracted}} to flowering soybean fields. The most severe infestations occur between flowering and when pods become fully developed. Large-scale outbreak is associated with time <b>of</b> <b>peak</b> flowering, when most pods are developed, and peak moth flight, for giant. Moths are also attracted to drought stressed soybeans or fields with poor growth. Dry weather leads to quick drying of corn plants, compelling moths to leave and seek other hosts. Heavy rainfall also decreases corn earworm populations because it drowns pupae in their soil chambers, limits moth flight, washes eggs from leaves, and creates favorable conditions for fungal diseases that kill caterpillars.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 American mycologist Martina S. Gilliam {{investigated}} the periodicity of spore release in M.rotula {{and concluded that}} spore discharge did not follow a regular circadian rhythm, as is typical of agaric and bolete mushrooms, but rather was dependent on rain. A threshold of rainfall is required to elicit a spore discharge response and the duration <b>of</b> <b>peak</b> spore discharge correlates {{with the amount of}} rainfall, rather than its duration. Furthermore, Gilliam noted that spore prints were more readily obtained if the stem ends were placed in water, suggesting that water must enter through the fruit body for discharge to occur.|$|E

5|$|On September19 and 20, Georges {{underwent}} {{a period of}} rapid intensification, in which winds increased by 45mph (85km/h) in a 24-hour span. At {{the end of this}} phase, Georges attained its peak intensity with winds of 155mph (250km/h) and a barometric pressure of 937mbar (hPa; 27.68inHg), just below Category 5 status. At the time <b>of</b> <b>peak</b> intensity, a Hurricane Hunter mission into the storm recorded flight-level winds up to 168mph (270km/h) while dropsondes measured surface winds up to 175mph (280km/h). One of the readings from a dropsonde, that was disregarded, recorded winds of 191mph (307km/h) in the lower-levels of the eyewall. This reading was disregarded by the hurricane hunters as it seemed too high and not representative of the actual intensity of Georges. The Hurricane Hunters also noted a large increase in the radius of tropical storm-force winds, prompting the issuance of tropical storm warnings in the Lesser Antilles. Around the time <b>of</b> <b>peak</b> intensity, the eye of Georges was roughly 35mi (55km) in diameter.|$|E
5|$|One alternative, {{aimed at}} {{avoiding}} inequality and revenue allocation issues, is {{to implement a}} rationing <b>of</b> <b>peak</b> period travel through mobility rights or revenue-neutral credit-based congestion pricing.

5|$|Around {{the time}} <b>of</b> <b>peak</b> {{intensity}}, Dvorak intensity estimates reached T6.0, equating to a minimal Category 4 hurricane with winds of 135mph (215km/h). A trough located {{to the north}} of the hurricane began to weaken, causing the storm to track in a more westward direction. Kiko weakened slightly before making landfall near Punta Arena, on the southern tip of Baja California, with winds of 115mph (185mph). Kiko was thus the second major hurricane to ever make landfall on the Gulf Coast of Baja California since reliable recordkeeping began in 1949, with the other being 1967's Hurricane Olivia. Due to the small size and slow movement of the storm, it rapidly weakened, becoming a tropical storm by 1800UTC. Convection associated with the storm significantly diminished; the center of circulation became nearly devoid of thunderstorm activity early on August28. Shortly after emerging into the Pacific Ocean, Kiko was further downgraded into a tropical depression, and turned towards the southwest due to interaction with nearby Tropical Storm Lorena. Tropical Depression Kiko dissipated around 1800UTC on August29; however, its remnants continued southward before being absorbed by Lorena.|$|E
5|$|By 5 December, the Australians {{had managed}} to {{stockpile}} enough supplies in forward areas to enable the 2/24th Infantry Battalion, which had been engaged in moving the stores, {{to be released from}} this task and thrown back into the fighting.

On 6 December, the remaining three companies of the 2/24th came up and as the Australians continued to advance towards Peak Hill they found considerable Japanese positions which had been abandoned. As movement was seen in Wareo, which was visible in the distance, an artillery bombardment was called in by the Australians. In the afternoon, the Australians cut the branch track that turned towards Kwatingkoo before an attack was put in on Peak Hill. The Japanese defences held and the attack beaten off, the Australians attempted to outflank to the north but they were prevented from doing so by the thick jungle and as the sun set, they had to be content to dig-in on the western approach to Peak Hill.|$|E

5|$|By January22, Charly {{developed}} a 37km (23mi) wide eye, surrounded by deep convection. Based on the increased organization, the storm became an intense tropical cyclone, reaching peak 10minute winds of 185km/h (115mph), {{according to the}} MFR. In contrast, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 195km/h (120mph). Late on January22, the wind shear and dry air increased while waters became cooler, all of which became detrimental to the storm's structure. The eye rapidly dissipated as the convection dwindled, and within 24hours <b>of</b> <b>peak</b> intensity, Charly was downgraded to tropical storm status. On January24, the storm passed about 320km (200mi) southeast of Rodrigues. By that time, the circulation was exposed from the thunderstorms, and Charly weakened to tropical depression status on January25. Caught in the weak low-level flow, the circulation moved erratically, first to the west, then drifting before turning to the southeast. It continued to produce some convection during this time, which spread rainfall over Mauritius and Réunion. A cold front swept Charly to the southeast, absorbing it on January31.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{has been}} in use at least 10,000 years, but more than 95% of all copper ever mined and smelted has been {{extracted}} since 1900, {{and more than half}} was extracted the last 24 years.

However, {{only a tiny fraction of}} these reserves is economically viable with present-day prices and technologies. Estimates of copper reserves available for mining vary from 25 years to 60 years, depending on core assumptions such as the growth rate. Recycling is a major source of copper in the modern world. Because of these and other factors, the future of copper production and supply is the subject of much debate, including the concept <b>of</b> <b>peak</b> copper, analogous to peak oil.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, {{the station}} {{became one of}} the UK's least {{efficient}} power stations. In 1998, plans were announced to use the station as a test-bed for clean coal technology, but the plans did not come to fruition. In 1999, then owners Innogy plc decided to take Blyth A out of operation, while Blyth B began operating only at times <b>of</b> <b>peak</b> demand, because the stations had become surplus to their generating needs. From 1 April 2000 onwards the station was taken out of service for the summer months, because of the low demand for electricity at that time of year. However, staff were retained to maintain the station. Innogy plc then began looking for a buyer for the station, to decide the site's future. They had been in talks with American based NRG Energy, over a £410million purchase of the station, along with the Killingholme Power Station in North Lincolnshire. There had also been rumours that a deal had been made to convert the station into a waste-to-energy plant. However, any plans to save the station fell through and the generation of electricity at the station ceased on 31 January 2001, after 43years of operating, resulting in the loss of 131jobs.|$|E
