40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{phytochemical}} composition and organoleptic properties of Pistacia lentiscus (L.) (P. lentiscus) from Algeria and {{to investigate the}} antioxidant activities of its essential oil and ethanolic extract. Methods: Aerial parts of P. lentiscus were collected at Hammam Melouane (Blida), 50 km from Algiers. Different solvent extractions were made for the preliminary screening of phytochemicals. Additionally, the physicochemical and organoleptic properties of the Algerian variety have been characterized. Moreover, P. lentiscus essential oil and ethanolic extract were studied for their antioxidant potential by ferric reducing power test. Results: Phytochemical screening of P. lentiscus revealed the presence of various biochemicals, including leuco-anthocyanins, condensed tannins, gallic tannins, saponoside, coumarins, and flavonoids, while others were absent (anthocyanins and alcaloids). Essential oil showed lower antioxidant potential compared to the ethanolic extract, reflecting the potential phenolic content responsible for this activity. Conclusions: The present study reveals the presence of various phytochemical classes in P. lentiscus, and the antioxidant experiment shows a good bioactivity of the aerial parts of the Algerian P. lentiscus. The literature review of the essential oil composition shows also important variations due to geographic and environmental conditions. This preliminary investigation will help explore the bioactive compounds of P. lentiscus, and will bring data for a better physicochemical and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>classification</b> of the Algerian variety...|$|E
40|$|Table olives {{are highly}} {{appreciated}} and consumed worldwide. Different aspects {{are used for}} trade category classification being the sensory assessment of negative defects present in the olives and brines {{one of the most}} important. The trade category quality classification must follow the International Olive Council directives, requiring the organoleptic assessment of defects by a trained sensory panel. However, the training process is a hard, complex and sometimes subjective task, being the low number of samples that can be evaluated per day a major drawback considering the real needs of the olive industry. In this context, the development of electronic tongues as taste sensors for defects sensory evaluation is of utmost relevance. So, an electronic tongue was used for table olives classification according to the presence and intensity of negative defects. Linear discrimination models were established based on sub-sets of sensor signals selected by a simulated annealing algorithm. The predictive potential of the novel approach was first demonstrated for standard solutions of chemical compounds that mimic butyric, putrid and zapateria defects (93 % for cross-validation procedures). Then its applicability was verified; using reference table olives/brine solutions samples identified with a single intense negative attribute, namely butyric, musty, putrid, zapateria or wineyvinegary defects (93 % cross-validation procedures). Finally, the E-tongue coupled with the same chemometric approach was applied to classify table olive samples according to the trade commercial categories (extra, 1 st choice, 2 nd choice and unsuitable for consumption) and an additional quality category (extra free of defects), established based on sensory analysis data. Despite the heterogeneity of the samples studied and number of different sensory defects perceived, the predictive linear discriminant model established showed sensitivities greater than 86 %. So, the overall performance achieved showed that the electrochemical device {{could be used as a}} taste sensor for table olives <b>organoleptic</b> trade successful <b>classification,</b> allowing a preliminary quality assessment, which could facilitate, in the future, the complex task of sensory panelists.
