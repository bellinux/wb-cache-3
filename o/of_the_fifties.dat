5|$|After {{completing}} I'm All Right Jack, Sellers {{returned to}} record {{a new series of}} The Goon Show. Over the course of two weekends, he took his 16mm cine-camera to Totteridge Lane in London and filmed himself, Spike Milligan, Mario Fabrizi, Leo McKern and Richard Lester. Originally intended as a private film, the eleven-minute short film The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film was screened at the 1959 Edinburgh and San Francisco film festivals. It won the award for best fiction short in the latter festival, and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Short Subject (Live Action). In 1959 Sellers released his second album, Songs For Swinging Sellers, which—like his first record—reached number three in the UK Albums Chart. Sellers's last film <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifties</b> was The Battle of the Sexes; a comedy directed by Charles Crichton.|$|E

25|$|In 1922 a {{proposal}} by Iran {{and several other}} countries in the League of Nations to have Esperanto taught in member nations' schools failed. Esperanto speakers were subject to persecution under Stalin's regime. In Germany under Hitler, in Spain under Franco for about a decade, in Portugal under Salazar, in Romania under Ceaucescu, and in half a dozen Eastern European countries during the late forties and part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifties,</b> Esperanto activities and the formation of Esperanto associations were forbidden. In spite of these factors more people continued to learn Esperanto, and significant literary work (both poetry and novels) appeared in Esperanto in the period between the World Wars and after them. Esperanto is spoken today in a growing number of countries and it has multiple generations of native speakers, although it is primarily used as a second language. Of the various constructed language projects, it is Esperanto that has so far come closest to becoming an officially recognized international auxiliary language; China publishes daily news in Esperanto.|$|E
25|$|Professional {{football}} came to Peru in 1951, {{when the}} Peruvian Football Federation adapted the championship {{according to the}} global guidelines for a professional league, but only with the participation of clubs located {{in the city of}} Lima and Province of Callao. The club debuted in the professional era with a win over Mariscal Sucre FBC with a score of 4–1. On 20 July 1952, the inauguration of Teodoro Lolo Fernandez stadium took place, with sporting facilities and a spectator stand which previously belonged to the first national stadium of the country. At the opening, Universitario beat Universidad de Chile by 4–2, with three goals scored by Teodoro Fernández himself. In 1954 Plácido Galindo took the club's presidency, in what was the first of his three administrations {{at the helm of the}} institution. Throughout this decade, the club conducted irregular campaigns in the newly professional league, which saw titles shared between Alianza Lima, Sport Boys, Mariscal Sucre, Sporting Cristal, and Centro Iqueño. The title drought <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifties</b> ended in 1959 when they won their eighth crown, after tying 3–3 with Deportivo Municipal in the final match, totaling fifteen wins, three draws and four losses.|$|E

"Following {{the success}} of Spartacus towards the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifties,</b> his {{remaining}} years were devoted less to composition, and more to conducting, teaching, bureaucracy and travel."

[...] "He frequently appeared in world forums in the role of champion of an apologist for the Soviet idea of creative orthodoxy."

500|$|The Independents radio critic Robert Hanks was unimpressed with Kneale's {{script for}} the {{dramatic}} sections, but praised {{the performance of}} Andrew Keir in the title role. [...] "Lesser actors would treat Kneale's downbeat script with a certain detachment, but Keir is prepared to charge even the most banal lines with a terror that's both a treat and a lesson." [...] Hanks also felt that The Fifties season as a whole, as demonstrated by The Quatermass Memoirs, had a somewhat misleading focus. [...] "You {{get the sense that}} a vogue for science fiction is being interpreted as the spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fifties,</b> with emphasis being put on a handful of sci-fi films. If you really wanted to read the age through its movies, you'd have to include Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, late Ealing and early Norman Wisdom, Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley. It's a lot to accommodate; perhaps sticking to terror is just less intimidating." ...|$|E

Harvey argues that {{it is because of}} Raymond and Foster that the illustrative style became the dominant one used for adventure strips. [...] "His work and Foster's created the visual standard by which all such comic strips would henceforth be measured." [...] Biographer Tom Roberts also believes Raymond's work on Rip Kirby [...] "inspired all the soap opera style strips <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifties</b> and sixties". Roberts argues that strips such as Apartment 3-G [...] "can trace their origins to the success of Raymond's strip". Although his work was rarely seen outside of the newspaper [...] "funny pages", as Raymond preferred to focus his energies on strip work, he also produced a number of [...] "illustrations for Blue Book, Look, Collier's and Cosmopolitan". as well as Esquire.|$|E
