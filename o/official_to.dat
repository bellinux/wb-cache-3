5|$|The British conquered Orissa in 1803, and, {{recognising}} {{the importance}} of the Jagannatha Temple {{in the life of the}} people of the state, they initially appointed an <b>official</b> <b>to</b> look after the temple's affairs and later declared the temple as part of a district.|$|E
5|$|After {{the work}} {{stoppage}} at pit number six, more white miners assembled near the town. They marched to Rock Springs {{by way of}} the railroad, carrying firearms. At about 10:00a.m., the bell in the Knights of Labor meeting hall tolled, and the miners inside the building joined the already large group. There were white miners who opted to go to saloons instead of joining the gathering mob, but by 2:00p.m., the saloons and grocers were persuaded by a Union Pacific <b>official</b> <b>to</b> close.|$|E

50|$|The {{regulation}} allows tax <b>officials</b> <b>to</b> deny tax benefits, if a deal {{is found}} without any commercial purpose other than tax avoidance. It allows tax <b>officials</b> <b>to</b> target participatory notes. Under GAAR, the investor has {{to prove that the}} participatory note was not set to avoid taxes. It also allows <b>officials</b> <b>to</b> deny double taxation avoidance benefits, if deals made in tax havens like Mauritius were found to be avoiding taxes.|$|R
25|$|Corruption among prison {{staff is}} rampant. Prisoners could bribe <b>officials</b> <b>to</b> leave {{prison for the}} day and serve their {{sentences}} in the evenings. Some prisoners bribed <b>officials</b> <b>to</b> serve their sentences in the national hospital in Niamey. Pretrial detainees were held with convicted prisoners.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1950s, Dasho Shingkhar Lam, former Secretary to Jigme Dorji Wangchuck and Sixth Speaker of the National Assembly (1971–74), was {{requested}} by the king to make several modifications to the flag; {{he is responsible for}} its current design, which has remained unchanged since 1969. The king was reportedly dissatisfied that the early square Bhutanese flags did not flutter like the rectangular Indian flag displayed on the visit of an Indian <b>official</b> <b>to</b> the country. The standard measurements of the flag of Bhutan were thereafter altered to resemble the flag of India, which was 9 feet by 6 feet.|$|E
5|$|Bo's {{stint as}} Minister of Commerce {{significantly}} raised his international profile and generated media attention both in China and abroad. Described as good-looking, articulate and open-minded in {{his approach to}} problems, Bo's rise from a municipal <b>official</b> <b>to</b> the central government generated great media fanfare and elevated his status to something of a 'political star.' Bo's political persona was considered {{a departure from the}} generally serious and conservative leadership in Beijing. With his youthful vigour, populism, and purported popularity with female reporters, Bo's political rise had been compared to that of John F. Kennedy.|$|E
5|$|He {{disappeared}} from the records until found as <b>Official</b> <b>to</b> the Archdeacon of Lothian (1283 × 1285). It is possible that in this period he left Scotland for further study. The position of Official was held under the absentee Archdeacon of Lothian, Adam de Gullane, and afterwards, Archdeacon William Frere, and was probably held along with the post of vicar of Haddington; the latter he definitely held by 1295. Nicholas is found as Official in a document dating certainly between 1273 and 1285, a document which can probably be more precisely dated to between 1283 and 1285.|$|E

5|$|In August 1870, Seward {{embarked}} on another trip, this time westbound around the world. With him was Olive Risley, {{daughter of a}} Treasury Department <b>official,</b> <b>to</b> whom he became close in his final year in Washington. They visited Japan, then China, where they walked on the Great Wall. During the trip, they decided that Seward would adopt Olive, and he did so, thus {{putting an end to}} gossip and the fears of his sons that Seward would remarry late in life. They spent three months in India, then journeyed through the Middle East and Europe, not returning to Auburn until October 1871.|$|E
5|$|Nicholas de Balmyle (d. 1319 × 1320), {{also called}} Nicholas of St Andrews, was a Scottish {{administrator}} and prelate {{in the late}} 13th century and early 14th century. A graduate of an unknown university, he served his earliest years as a clergyman at St Andrews, moving on to hold churches in Lothian as well as deputising (as <b>Official)</b> <b>to</b> two archdeacons of Lothian.|$|E
5|$|Officials in Texas, Florida, Alabama, Wyoming, Arizona, Oklahoma and Missouri opposed those {{elements}} of ACA over {{which they had}} discretion. For example, Missouri declined to expand Medicaid or establish a health insurance marketplace engaging in active non-cooperation, enacting a statute forbidding any state or local <b>official</b> <b>to</b> render any aid not specifically required by federal law. Other Republican politicians discouraged efforts to advertise {{the benefits of the}} law. Some conservative political groups launched ad campaigns to discourage enrollment.|$|E

On May 22, 2014, the United States Postal Service issued a postage stamp honoring Harvey Milk, the first openly LGBT political <b>official</b> <b>to</b> receive this honor. The stamp features a photo taken in front of Milk's Castro Camera store and was unveiled on {{what would have been}} his 84th birthday.|$|E

5|$|The raid on bin Laden's {{compound}} in Abbottabad, Pakistan was launched from Afghanistan. U.S. military {{officials said that}} after the raid U.S. forces took bin Laden's body to Afghanistan for identification, then buried him at sea within 24 hours of his death in accordance with Islamic tradition. According to Carlotta Gall, a Pakistani <b>official</b> (<b>to</b> whom she later clarified {{that she did not}} speak, the information coming through a friend), told her that a senior U.S. official had told him that the United States had direct evidence that Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Shuja Pasha, knew of bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad, but ISI, Pasha and officials in Washington all denied this.|$|E
5|$|The {{value to}} the sinecurist of an office like that of Paymaster of Marines lay {{not so much in}} the {{official}} salary attached to it, but in the lax accounting procedures associated with disbursement of funds, which allowed the <b>official</b> <b>to</b> retain large sums of public money in his own hands for many years until accounts were made up. The office of Paymaster General had been reformed in 1783 to avoid these abuses, but these changes had not yet been extended to the Marines during Villiers' tenure.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his career, Berrios {{combined}} {{government sector}} jobs, elected office, unpaid political party leadership positions, {{and private sector}} proprietorships in lobbying, consulting and insurance sales.

In the press and in the courts, Berrios has repeatedly defended his right as an elected <b>official</b> <b>to</b> hire relatives and to accept campaign contributions from those with business before his office.|$|E

5|$|Bernier {{went on to}} win his {{election}} in Beauce with 62% of the vote. Harper won re-election as prime-minister; he did not appoint Bernier to a cabinet position. Bernier would eventually return to the cabinet following the 2011 election, in which the Conservatives won a majority government, as Minister of State for Small Business and Tourism. Bernier continues to sit as an MP, and is currently a candidate for the Conservative Party leadership. Stemming from Couillard's actions during the entire affair, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) launched investigations on how she obtained the secret documents; on whether Couillard's mother was offered a patronage appointment by a Conservative Party <b>official</b> <b>to</b> the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada; and on whether there was influence peddling during the land sale between the Kevlar Group and Public Works.|$|E

Wiggum takes pity on Homer and tells him to meet with an FBI agent, who offers to reduce the sentence if Homer will go undercover in the prison to investigate Fat Tony, who is also serving time along with his top henchmen.|$|E
