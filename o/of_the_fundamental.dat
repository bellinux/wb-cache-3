5|$|The Fundamental Rights are not {{absolute}} and {{are subject to}} reasonable restrictions as necessary {{for the protection of}} public interest. In the Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala case in 1973, the Supreme Court, overruling a previous decision of 1967, held that the Fundamental Rights could be amended, subject to judicial review in case such an amendment violated the basic structure of the Constitution. The Fundamental Rights can be enhanced, removed or otherwise altered through a constitutional amendment, passed by a two-thirds majority of each House of Parliament. The imposition of a state of emergency may lead to a temporary suspension any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fundamental</b> Rights, excluding Articles 20 and 21, by order of the President. The President may, by order, suspend the right to constitutional remedies as well, thereby barring citizens from approaching the Supreme Court for the enforcement of any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fundamental</b> Rights, except Articles 20 and 21, during the period of the emergency. Parliament may also restrict the application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fundamental</b> Rights to members of the Indian Armed Forces and the police, in order to ensure proper discharge of their duties and the maintenance of discipline, by a law made under Article 33.|$|E

In addition, this RFC attempted to summarize the syntaxes of URL schemes in use at the time. It also acknowledged, but did not standardize, the existence of relative URLs and fragment identifiers.|$|E

These higher notes, far from being perceived as conventional harmony, function as harmonics that alter the timbre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> note like mixture stops on a pipe organ. An example is {{the song of the}} golden oriole in Le loriot of the Catalogue d'oiseaux for solo piano (Example 4).|$|E
5|$|The ISA has its {{constitutional}} basis in Article 149 of the Constitution, which sanctions preventive detention {{and allows for}} laws passed by the legislature against subversion to override the Articles protecting the personal liberties of the individual. Specifically, Article 149(1) declares such legislation to be valid notwithstanding any inconsistency with five <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> liberty provisions in the Constitution, including Article 9. Thus, detentions under the ISA cannot be challenged {{on the basis of}} deprivation of these rights.|$|E
5|$|The {{meaning of}} the word law in Article 9(1) has a direct bearing on the scope of the Article. If law is read broadly (for example, as {{incorporating}} customary international law principles), the scope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> liberties would be wider. It would be narrower if, on the other hand, law is construed narrowly, as the Legislature would be able to curtail such rights through legislation more easily. This could lead to a watering-down of the emphasis on fundamental liberties, as any infringement might be considered legitimate so long as the statute in question was validly enacted.|$|E
