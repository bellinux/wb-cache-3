5|$|Conscience is an aptitude, faculty, intuition or {{judgment}} that assists in distinguishing right from wrong. Moral judgment may derive from values or norms (principles and rules). In psychological terms conscience {{is often described}} as leading to feelings of remorse when a human commits actions that go against his/her moral values and to feelings of rectitude or integrity when actions conform to such norms. The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such moral judgments are <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> based in reason has occasioned debate through much of the history of Western philosophy.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} intent theory, {{which holds that}} interpretation of a written constitution is (<b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>be)</b> consistent with what was meant by those who drafted and ratified it. That is currently a minority view among originalists.|$|E
25|$|Final {{deliberations}} in {{the legislature}} centered on whether a referendum either was <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> required for any portion of the financing. All sides recognized that such a requirement would kill the project, and thus it became a proxy for deciding whether a ballpark should be built at all.|$|E
50|$|To use the table, some word <b>or</b> {{sentence}} <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{agreed on}} by twocorrespondents. This {{may be called}} the 'key-word', <b>or</b> 'key-sentence',and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> carried in the memory only.|$|R
50|$|The minimal scores {{required}} for Olympiad medals and honourable mentions are {{chosen by the}} organizers according to the following rules: A gold medal <b>should</b> <b>be</b> awarded to the top 8% of the participants. A silver medal <b>or</b> better <b>should</b> <b>be</b> awarded to the top 25%. A bronze medal <b>or</b> better <b>should</b> <b>be</b> awarded to the top 50%. An honourable mention <b>or</b> better <b>should</b> <b>be</b> awarded to the top 67%. All other participants receive certificates of participation. The participant with the highest score (absolute winner) receives a special prize, {{in addition to a}} gold medal.|$|R
2500|$|... "Which comes {{closest to}} your view? Gay couples <b>should</b> <b>be</b> allowed to legally marry. <b>OR,</b> Gay couples <b>should</b> <b>be</b> allowed to form civil unions but not legally marry. <b>OR,</b> There <b>should</b> <b>be</b> no legal {{recognition}} of a gay couple's relationship." ...|$|R
25|$|In {{determining}} whether a species can <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> used for falconry, the species' behavior in a captive environment, its responsiveness to training, and its typical prey and hunting habits are considered.To some degree, a species' reputation will determine whether it's used, although this factor is somewhat harder to objectively gauge.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes what {{defines a}} {{population}} is obvious. For example, a manufacturer needs to decide whether a batch of material from production is of high enough quality to be released to the customer, <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> sentenced for scrap or rework due to poor quality. In this case, the batch is the population.|$|E
25|$|Opponents {{claim that}} {{standardized}} tests are misused and uncritical judgments {{of intelligence and}} performance, but supporters argue that these aren't negatives of standardized tests, but criticisms of poorly designed testing regimes. They argue that testing should and does focus educational resources {{on the most important}} aspects of education— imparting a pre-defined set of knowledge and skills— and that other aspects are either less important, <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> added to the testing scheme.|$|E
5000|$|Potential {{regulatory}} overlaps <b>or</b> inconsistencies <b>should</b> <b>be</b> addressed.|$|R
50|$|There is {{controversy}} over whether <b>or</b> not Aegyptopithecus <b>should</b> <b>be</b> a genus {{on its own}} <b>or</b> whether it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> moved into the genus Propliopithecus.|$|R
5000|$|The {{programme}} <b>or</b> scheme <b>should</b> <b>be</b> in {{the nature}} of a pace setter <b>or</b> <b>should</b> relate to demonstration, survey or research.|$|R
25|$|Vocal resonation is {{the process}} by which the basic product of {{phonation}} is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes {{on its way to the}} outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>be,</b> to make a better sound.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{conventional}} International Date Line {{is a relatively}} recent geographic and political construct whose exact location has moved {{from time to time}} depending on the needs of different interested parties. There are no objective criteria for its placement. In that light, it cannot be taken for granted that {{the conventional}} International Date Line can (<b>or</b> <b>should)</b> <b>be</b> used as a date line under Jewish law. In practice, within Judaism the halakhic date line is similar to, but not necessarily identical with, the conventional Date Line, and the differences can have consequences under religious law.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1895, {{all income}} taxes had been {{considered}} indirect taxes (not required to be apportioned among the states according to the population of each state). In the controversial 1895 case of Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., however, the Court had overturned longstanding precedent and ruled that while a tax on income from labor was an excise, or indirect tax (which was not required to be apportioned), a tax on income derived from property such as interest, dividends, or rents was <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> treated as a direct tax.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{completion}} of the album, Rowland said: [...] "I'm so excited for everyone to hear {{the rest of the}} album. For a long time, I thought about, 'Should it <b>be</b> dance <b>or</b> <b>should</b> it <b>be</b> urban <b>or</b> <b>should</b> it <b>be</b> this <b>or</b> <b>should</b> it <b>be</b> that?' And I was like, 'Why am I allowing people to make me think like that?" [...] She added, [...] "It's just about artistry, it's just about freedom," [...] she continued. [...] "It's just about music. It's about being alive and being happy and living life and being a woman, just feeling amazing..." ...|$|R
5000|$|No banks <b>or</b> {{non-banks}} <b>should</b> <b>be</b> labeled “systemically important.” ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{offers the}} most recent {{development}} regarding the {{soil and water conservation}} topics and current major conservation activities. The report addresses these conservation topics; what <b>should</b> <b>be</b> the priorities for the conservation effort; and deciding whether any existing programs <b>or</b> activities <b>should</b> <b>be</b> modified <b>or</b> eliminated and whether new programs <b>or</b> activities <b>should</b> <b>be</b> added to the effort...|$|R
25|$|Souter also rebuked the {{majority}} for accepting the incorrect view that any statement {{made by a}} public employee constitutes, <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> treated as, the government’s own speech, because such a view is valid only when a public employee is hired to promote a particular policy by communicating a particular message. He further disagreed with {{the majority}}’s argument for limiting the Pickering doctrine, which held that the First Amendment protections were unnecessary {{in light of the}} existence of a comprehensive set of state and federal statutes that protected government whistle-blowers. Souter noted that speech that addressed official wrongdoing may well be unprotected under existing statutory protections (e.g., the teacher in Givhan would not qualify as a whistle-blower).|$|E
25|$|Vocal resonation is {{the process}} by which the basic product of {{phonation}} is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes {{on its way to the}} outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>be,</b> to make a better sound. There are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators. In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the chest, the tracheal tree, the larynx itself, the pharynx, the oral cavity, the nasal cavity, and the sinuses.|$|E
25|$|Food versus fuel is {{the dilemma}} {{regarding}} {{the risk of}} diverting farmland or crops for biofuels production {{to the detriment of}} the food supply. The biofuel and food price debate involves wide-ranging views, and is a long-standing, controversial one in the literature. There is disagreement about the significance of the issue, what is causing it, and what can <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> done to remedy the situation. This complexity and uncertainty is due to the large number of impacts and feedback loops that can positively or negatively affect the price system. Moreover, the relative strengths of these positive and negative impacts vary in the short and long terms, and involve delayed effects. The academic side of the debate is also blurred by the use of different economic models and competing forms of statistical analysis.|$|E
5000|$|Two <b>or</b> {{more jobs}} <b>should</b> <b>be</b> worked upon {{at the same}} time or two <b>or</b> more {{operations}} <b>should</b> <b>be</b> carried out on a job simultaneously if possible.|$|R
2500|$|... "Do {{you think}} marriages between {{same-sex}} couples <b>should</b> <b>or</b> <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> {{recognized by the}} law as valid, with {{the same rights as}} traditional marriages?"

25|$|Husserl never {{claimed that}} {{mathematics}} could <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> grounded in part-whole rather than set theory. Lesniewski consciously derived his mereology {{as an alternative}} to set theory as a foundation of mathematics, but did not work out the details. Goodman and Quine (1947) tried to develop the natural and real numbers using the calculus of individuals, but were mostly unsuccessful; Quine did not reprint that article in his Selected Logic Papers. In a series of chapters in the books he published in the last decade of his life, Richard Milton Martin set out to do what Goodman and Quine had abandoned 30 years prior. A recurring problem with attempts to ground mathematics in mereology is how to build up the theory of relations while abstaining from set-theoretic definitions of the ordered pair. Martin argued that Eberle's (1970) theory of relational individuals solved this problem.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, {{the state}} {{legislature}} passed amendments preventing the Department of Housing Preservation and Development from rescinding certificates of eligibility for any projects starter on July 1, 1976. In 1977, the program was extended for an additional four years. Then, in 1978, the requirement that privately owned buildings contain at least six dwelling units was removed. Three years later, non-condominiums under the program were made {{to be subject to}} rent stabilization laws, a change from temporary subjection to those same laws. The 1981 amendments also allowed the HPD to restrict access to the program for areas that did not need the tax incentives <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> used for non-residential purposes. In 1983, certain cities in the state were permitted to limit, restrict, or conditions 421-a benefits. Also in 1983, the state rescinded 421-a tax benefits for multi-family dwellings that were converted from non-residential use.|$|E
25|$|Scream 3 (2000) was {{released}} {{just over two}} years after Scream 2 with Craven again attached to direct the film on a greatly increased budget of $40 million. Shortly before production began on the film, the Columbine incident occurred and with it came an increased scrutiny on the media {{and its effect on}} people, particularly films. There were considerations at the time about whether the studio should continue production of a third installment {{in the aftermath of the}} incident but the studio decided to continue, albeit with changes. The studio was much more apprehensive concerning violence and gore in the film than with previous installments with them pressing for a greater emphasis on the series' humor while scaling back on the violence. At one point in the production, the studio demanded that the film feature no blood or on-screen violence but Craven intervened stating that the film should either have the violence present in earlier Scream films <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> called something other than Scream. As with production of Scream, Craven would again state in an interview that issues with censorship and the MPAA made him consider leaving the horror genre.|$|E

500|$|NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, at a 2007 {{press conference}} {{broadcast}} on CBC Sports, said, [...] "Fighting {{has always had}} a role in the game... from a player safety standpoint, what happens in fighting is something {{we need to look at}} just as we need to look at hits to the head. But we're not looking to have a debate on whether fighting is good or bad <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> part of the game." ...|$|E
500|$|According to A. D. Gorwala, ICS [...] "The Joint Secretaries {{ought to}} in reality {{be what the}} name implies, namely {{secretaries}} for the subject entrusted to them and joined to a more senior secretary {{for the convenience of}} administrative work." [...] Sir Richard Tottenham, ICS had once expressed [...] "In my opinion there is, <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>be,</b> no distinction of function, but only of pay between a Joint and an Additional Secretary. Additional and Joint Secretaries should not be either cheap Secretaries or expensive Deputy Secretaries." ...|$|E
500|$|By far {{the most}} {{explosive}} growth in species numbers (in absolute terms) {{has been in the}} genera Microcebus and Lepilemur. In 2006, 15new species of Lepilemur were described, with three new species reported in February, one in June, and 11 in September. [...] Since then, three additional species have been described, one of {{which turned out to be}} identical to a previously described species. Genetic and morphological differences seem to suggest that they are cryptic species, but there is still debate whether these merit full species status <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> regarded as subspecies of previously identified, [...] "core" [...] species.|$|E
