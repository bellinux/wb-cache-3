5|$|Finally, in {{practice}} {{one wants to}} approximate the function with a finite number <b>of</b> <b>terms,</b> say with a Taylor polynomial or a partial sum of the trigonometric series, respectively.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to empirical {{research on the}} dynamics <b>of</b> the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade. We start by proposing a method for constructing different measures <b>of</b> the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade. This is achieved by estimating a range of substitution elasticities using a panel data approach and highly disaggregated data on trade flows. Next, various measures <b>of</b> the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade and trade margins are related to productivity and demand proxies. We find that domestic demand side movements are positively related to the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade, while domestic productivity gains result in a deterioration <b>of</b> the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade. Our results suggest that higher relative productivity raises the real component of exports relative to imports along the intensive margin inducing a weakening <b>of</b> the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade. <b>Terms</b> <b>of</b> trade; Trade margins; International prices...|$|R

5|$|In the Republic of India, a chief {{minister}} {{is the head}} of government of each of twenty-nine states and two union territories (Delhi and Puducherry). According to the Constitution of India, at the state-level, the governor is de jure head, but de facto executive authority rests with the chief minister. Following elections to the state legislative assembly, the governor usually invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the government. The governor appoints the chief minister, whose council of ministers are collectively responsible to the assembly. Given he has the assembly's confidence, the chief minister's term is usually for a maximum of five years; there are no limits to the number <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> he/she can serve.|$|E

A series <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> were proposed by Rainilaiarivony that the nobles agreed to impose on Radama's widow, Rasoherina. Under Rainilaiarivony's new monarchy, a sovereign required the consent of the nobles to issue a death sentence or promulgate a new law, and was forbidden to disband the army. The new power sharing agreement was concluded by a political marriage between the queen and the Prime Minister.|$|E

5|$|Sylvester's {{sequence}} {{is named after}} James Joseph Sylvester, who first investigated it in 1880. Its values grow doubly exponentially, and {{the sum of its}} reciprocals forms a series of unit fractions that converges to 1 more rapidly than any other series of unit fractions with the same number <b>of</b> <b>terms.</b> The recurrence by which it is defined allows the numbers in the sequence to be factored more easily than other numbers of the same magnitude, but, due to the rapid growth of the sequence, complete prime factorizations are known only for a few of its members. Values derived from this sequence have also been used to construct finite Egyptian fraction representations of 1, Sasakian Einstein manifolds, and hard instances for online algorithms.|$|E

The state constitution of 1876 originally called for election of the governor every two years, with their term beginning on the second Tuesday of the January following the election. An amendment passed in 1956, taking effect in 1959, increased terms to four years. Originally, there was no term limit applied to the governor; a 1990 amendment allowed governors to succeed themselves only once.
