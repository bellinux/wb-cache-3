50|$|Biopesticides for {{use against}} crop {{diseases}} have already established {{themselves on a}} variety of crops. For example, biopesticides already {{play an important role in}} controlling downy mildew diseases. Their benefits include: a 0-Day Pre-Harvest Interval (see: maximum residue limit), the ability to use under moderate to severe disease pressure, and the ability to use as a tank mix or in a rotational program with other registered fungicides. Because some market studies estimate that as much as 20% of global fungicide sales are directed at downy mildew diseases, the integration of biofungicides into grape production has substantial benefits in terms of extending the useful life of <b>other</b> <b>fungicides,</b> especially those in the reduced-risk category.|$|E
50|$|Resistance {{to common}} {{fungicides}} is currently combated {{through the use}} of other chemicals. For example, sodium o-phenylphenate-resistant strains are dealt with via formaldehyde fumigation while imazalil-resistant strains are controlled {{through the use of}} pyrimethanil, a fungicide also approved for fighting strains resistant to <b>other</b> <b>fungicides.</b> As fungicide resistance increases globally, other measures of control are being considered including that of biocontrol. Effective biocontrol agents include bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Pseudomonas syringae as well as fungi such as Debaryomyces hansenii and Candida guilliermondii. In Clementines and Valencia oranges, Candida oleophila, Pichia anomala and Candida famata have been shown to reduce disease. Despite the ability of various biocontrol agents to exhibit antagonistic activity, biocontrol has not been shown to provide complete control over P.digitatum and is therefore commonly used in conjunction with another measure of control. Alternative measures of control include essential oils such as Syzygium aromaticum and Lippia javanica, ultraviolet light, curing, vapour heat and cell-penetrating anti-fungal peptides.|$|E
50|$|The {{conditions}} {{conducive to}} the growth of powdery mildew on mango are consistent enough that predictions can be made as to when to apply fungicides to protect the crop. These predictions are based mainly on mean daily temperature and rainfall, and have been used to create a simple program that indicates when spraying is necessary. The most commonly used means of control of Oidium mangiferae is the use of sulfur and copper fungicides, particularly copper sulfate and elemental sulfur. Bordeaux mixture, when applied prior to flowering, has also been shown to have a preventative effect. Sulfur fungicides are applied by dusting onto the plant, with an application rate of 1-3 lbs of fungicide per tree. The sulfur is applied shortly after flowering, followed by two more applications at 15-day intervals. Fungicides are most effective if applied when the flowers are at 30-40% blooming, or when the first conidia are trapped {{in the vicinity of the}} trees. <b>Other</b> <b>fungicides</b> that have shown some potential for disease control on the mango, including Baycor, Calixin, and Bayleton among others. These fungicides require four applications at 10- to 14-day intervals, beginning at the first appearance of the disease, and produce a significantly reduced percent disease index and percent leaves infected in comparison to untreated plants. Benzimidazole fungicides are also known to be effective, though these have been out of production for several years. Since mangoes are a perennial crop and therefore the farmers that raise them are obligated to produce the same product from one year to the next despite any economic and production changes, fungicide applications may vary from year to year. In certain years and conditions, it may not be financially feasible or reasonable to perform pathogen control to the same extent as it was previously. Because of this, it is in the growers' better interests to invest in crops that have natural resistance to pathogens so that fungicide requirements will be minimized. Though fungicides appear to be effective in preventing and controlling this disease, a variety of management strategies have also been proposed to prevent powdery mildew spread. In particular, prudent application of irrigation, use of only healthy seeds, seedling and plants for grafting and use of cover crops or mixed cropping in the vicinity of the mango orchard to remove other possible hosts that could harbor disease that may spread to the mango. Sanitation via removal or burning of diseased plants and proper use of fungicides and fertilizers are also promoted for disease control.|$|E

Chemical control is the most common approach adopted by growers to manage a number of these diseases.

Two fungal species, Fusarium incarnatum-equiseti species complex (FIESC) and Colletotrichum truncatum are important pathogens of bell pepper in Trinidad.

40|$|Fusarium graminearum is a plant {{pathogen}} infecting several important cereals, resulting in substantial yield losses and mycotoxin {{contamination of the}} grain. Triazole fungicides are used to control diseases caused by this fungus on a worldwide scale. Our previous microarray study indicated that 15 ABC transporter genes were transcriptionally upregulated in response to tebuconazole treatment. Here, we deleted four ABC transporter genes in two genetic backgrounds of F. graminearum representing the DON (deoxynivalenol) and the NIV (nivalenol) trichothecene chemotypes. Deletion of FgABC 3 and FgABC 4 belonging to group I of ABC-G and to group V of ABC-C subfamilies of ABC transporters, respectively, considerably increased the sensitivity to the class I sterol biosynthesis inhibitors triazoles and fenarimol.
