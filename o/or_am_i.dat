500|$|After Harriet Adams died in 1982, her protégé, Nancy Axelrad, oversaw {{production}} of the Nancy Drew books briefly before the Stratemeyer Syndicate was sold to Simon & Schuster. Simon & Schuster turned to book packager Mega-Books for new writers. The books and Nancy's character began to change as a result, although there is disagreement {{on the nature of}} this change. Some contend that Nancy's character becomes [...] "more like Mildred Wirt Benson's original heroine than any [...] since 1956." [...] Others criticize the series for its increasing incorporation of romance and [...] " [...] of pre-feminist [...]" [...] For example, volume 78 in the series Update on Crime (1992) opens with Nancy wondering in italics, [...] "Am I <b>or</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> not in love with Ned Nickerson?" [...] Nancy begins dating other young men and acknowledges sexual desires: [...] "'I saw ... You don't have to apologize to me if some guy turns you on.' 'Gianni doesn't turn me on!... Won't you please let me explain.'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Animal" [...] is a pop {{song with}} horn and staccato {{synthesizer}} instrumentation. According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, {{the song is}} written in the time signature of common time with a moderate beat rate of 118 beats per minute. It is written in the key of E major and Wyatt's vocal range spans the notes of B3 to C6. It has an E–Fm7–Cm chord progression and a verse-chorus structure. Sam Richards of NME and Ben Hogwood of musicOMH compared the sound and rhythm of the song to works by English band The Police, while Paul Lester of The Guardian likened lead singer Wyatt's vocals to those of The Police's lead singer Sting. Jason Lymangrover of AllMusic compared the hook to works by American band Vampire Weekend, and said that [...] "dubby synths circulate around flighty vocals with heavy sentiments". Wyatt sings lyrics such as [...] "But I'm still trying to make my mind up, am I free <b>or</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> tied up?" [...] with [...] "unassuming cheeriness", and the chorus contains the line [...] "I change shapes just to hide in this place, but I'm still, I'm still an animal".|$|E
