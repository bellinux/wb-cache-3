25|$|A {{consequence}} of the black market for organs has {{been a number of}} cases and suspected cases of organ theft, including murder for the purposes of organ theft. Proponents of a legal market for organs say that the black-market nature of the current trade allows such tragedies and that regulation of the market could prevent them. <b>Opponents</b> <b>say</b> that such a market would encourage criminals by making it easier for them to claim that their stolen organs were legal.|$|E
25|$|An {{analysis}} by Fitch, a credit-rating agency, determined {{that as many}} as four of Atlantic City's eight casinos would be bankrupted by expanding casino gambling outside the city. Supporters of gambling in North Jersey say that the measure would help Atlantic City by redirecting as much as $200 million a year in tax revenue to the city. <b>Opponents</b> <b>say</b> that it is unlikely that much revenue would be generated and that it would not make up for the losses due to new competition. In recent years four Atlantic City casinos have closed, causing severe economic problems.|$|E

5000|$|An [...] "I Quit" [...] {{match is}} a type of {{professional}} wrestling match in which the only way to win is to make the <b>opponent</b> <b>say</b> the words [...] "I quit" [...] (usually into a microphone). It is a variation of submission match, as it can only be won by submission, but is special in that the submission has to take the form of the forfeiting <b>opponent</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "I quit". Generally, whenever a wrestler knocks down his opponent with a move or inflicts a submission move, the opponent will be asked - either by the referee or the <b>opponent</b> - to <b>say</b> the words into a microphone. [...] "I Quit" [...] matches are commonly used to settle kayfabe grudges and embarrass rivals, since saying [...] "I quit" [...] is usually a sign of admitted inferiority.|$|R
5000|$|Jordan, {{like most}} Johnson County representatives, has {{continually}} voted against increasing education funding statewide.

25|$|In October 2014, Quang Binh {{province}} {{announced plans}} by Sun Group {{to build a}} cable car system linking caves in the park. The plan was met {{with a great deal}} of opposition from conservationists, and the government backtracked, saying that the plan was not yet approved. Proponents say that the area is attracting a growing number of visitors and that the cable car would be the most environmentally friendly means of managing the crowds. <b>Opponents</b> <b>say</b> that construction of the cable car system could damage the fragile caves, and once it is operational it would attract more visitors than the park can sustainably handle.|$|E
25|$|<b>Opponents</b> <b>say</b> {{that nuclear}} power poses many threats {{to people and}} the environment. These threats include health risks and {{environmental}} damage from uranium mining, processing and transport, the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation or sabotage, and the unsolved problem of radioactive nuclear waste. They also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong, {{and there have been}} many serious nuclear accidents. Critics do not believe that these risks can be reduced through new technology. They argue that when all the energy-intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered, from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning, nuclear power is not a low-carbon electricity source.|$|E
25|$|A 2005 Bill, H.R. 2389, to {{prohibit}} the Supreme Court's and most federal courts from considering any legal {{challenges to the}} government's requiring or promoting of the Pledge of Allegiance, died in the Senate after having passed in the House. This action is viewed in general as court stripping by Congress of the constitutional power of the Judiciary. Even if a similar bill is enacted, its practical effect may not be clear: proponents of the bill have {{said that it is}} a valid exercise of Congress's power to regulate the jurisdiction of the federal courts under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution, but <b>opponents</b> <b>say</b> Congress does not have the authority to prevent the Supreme Court from hearing claims based on the Bill of Rights, since amendments postdate the original text of the Constitution and may thus implicitly limit the scope of Article III, Section 2. Judges and legal analysts have said that if Congress can remove from the judicial branch the ability to determine if legislation is constitutional, the US separation of powers would be disturbed, or rendered non-functional.|$|E

For example, Eve may coerce Bob into believing he shares the key with Eve, while he actually shares the key with Alice. The “key share” with Alice is thus unknown to Bob.|$|R
25|$|<b>Opponents</b> <b>say</b> {{that nuclear}} power poses many threats {{to people and}} the environment, and that costs do not justify benefits. Threats include health risks and {{environmental}} damage from uranium mining, processing and transport, the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation or sabotage, and the unsolved problem of radioactive nuclear waste. Another environmental issue is discharge of hot water into the sea. The hot water modifies the environmental conditions for marine flora and fauna. They also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong, {{and there have been}} many serious nuclear accidents. Critics do not believe that these risks can be reduced through new technology. They argue that when all the energy-intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered, from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning, nuclear power is not a low-carbon electricity source. Those countries that do not contain uranium mines cannot achieve energy independence through existing nuclear power technologies. Actual construction costs often exceed estimates, and spent fuel management costs do not have a clear time limit.|$|E
25|$|Metro is {{publicly}} owned, receiving {{funding from}} council tax payers and government. Nexus, which owns and manages Metro, contracted out operations and train maintenance {{as part of}} a deal with the UK Government to secure modernisation investment and operating subsidy for the system between 2010 and 2021. Nexus continued to set fares, set frequency of services and Metro operating hours. <b>Opponents</b> <b>say</b> this was privatisation by the back door, though some services had already been contracted out, such as cleaning of stations and ticket inspections. On 3 November 2008, Nexus invited potential bidders to declare an interest in a contract to run the operations side of the business on its behalf. The successful bidder was to obtain a seven-year contract commencing on 1 April 2010, with up to an additional two years depending on performance. In February 2009 four bids were shortlisted; DB Regio, MTR Corporation, Serco-Abellio, and an in-house bid by Metro. By October 2009 the shortlist had been reduced to bids from DB Regio and Nexus. In December 2009, DB Regio was named as the preferred bidder. The contract for operating the system was signed on 2 February 2010, and the service was handed over to DB Regio on 1 April 2010.|$|E

In an unusual {{campaign}} tactic, Tribbitt refused to debate his court room trained <b>opponent,</b> <b>saying</b> that he would lose the debate. After leaving office he worked with the Delaware River Basin Commission and the Diamond Group consulting firm. He relocated his residence to Dover and finally to Rehoboth Beach.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 19th Century in rugby football, the ball became {{dead in the}} field of play only by mutual consent of opponents. A player {{carrying}} the ball and held by <b>opponents</b> would <b>say,</b> [...] "Held!", and his <b>opponent</b> would <b>say,</b> [...] "Have it down."

[...] In the long run, so <b>opponents</b> <b>say,</b> this strategy has resulted in concession after concession to the opposition and promotion of a free-market economic agenda favorable to corporations and entrepreneurs, including those seeking to privatize public services, while alienating traditionally-allied voters and working-class people.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the special}} election, Donelon faced a fellow Democrat-turned-Republican in state Senator James David Cain of Dry Creek. Cain {{questioned}} Donelon's {{commitment to the}} Republican Party because of Donelon's acceptance of the staff appointment from the Democrat Wooley. Yet, Donelon has been a registered Republican for twenty years longer than has Cain. Cain's <b>opponents</b> <b>say</b> that he violated Ronald W.

2500|$|The use {{of marine}} mammals by the Navy, even in {{accordance}} with the Navy's stated policy, continues to meet opposition. Opponents cite the inevitable stresses involved in this type of training, which is contrary to the animals' natural lifestyles, particularly regarding their confinement when not training. There is continuing controversy over the use of anti-foraging devices, such as muzzles, which prevent the dolphins from foraging for food while working. The Navy states that this is to prevent their ingesting harmful objects, but <b>opponents</b> <b>say</b> that this is done to reinforce the handlers' control over the dolphins, which is based on food rewards. The re-integration and/or extended care of [...] "retired" [...] animals is also a concern.|$|E

2500|$|As {{has often}} been the pattern in Manhattan, a {{neighborhood}} that is [...] "discovered" [...] by artists and bohemians and then becomes [...] "hip" [...] will often begin to attract more affluent residents, which drives {{up the price of}} housing, and begins to drive out the residents who [...] "turned over" [...] the neighborhood. This is one theory of gentrification, and some argue that it has also occurred in the New York City neighborhoods SoHo and Tribeca in Manhattan, as well as Williamsburg in Brooklyn. Over the course of time, this demographic shift begins to change the essential character of the neighborhood: it becomes safer, more comfortable, less tolerant of noise, and less [...] "edgy". Some gentrification <b>opponents</b> <b>say</b> that this process causes the neighborhood to lose its unique identity for the sake of money.|$|E
2500|$|Pasteurization <b>opponents</b> <b>say</b> that {{raw milk}} {{contains}} bacteria {{beneficial to the}} human digestive system, but pasteurization is not selective and affects all bacteria whether beneficial or infectious. These bacteria include species considered to be probiotics, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, useful for the culturing of yogurt and cheese. Fermented milk products with levels of L. acidophilus significantly higher than those found in raw milk {{have been associated with}} decreased [...] of pediatric diarrhea, decreased levels of toxic amines in the blood of dialysis patients with small bowel bacterial overgrowth, aided lactose digestion in lactose-intolerant subjects, and a reduction in coronary heart disease risks. However, food scientists and FDA officials maintain that such [...] "good bacteria" [...] can be found in pasteurized products, including yogurt, and argue that the destruction of pathogens far outweighs any proposed benefit to keeping the beneficial microbes alive.|$|E
2500|$|LGBT {{movements}} are opposed {{by a variety}} of individuals and organizations. They may have a personal, moral, political or religious objection to gay rights, homosexual relations or gay people. [...] <b>Opponents</b> <b>say</b> same-sex relationships are not marriages, that legalization of same-sex marriage will open the door for the legalization of polygamy, [...] that it is unnatural and that it encourages unhealthy behavior. Some social conservatives believe that all sexual relationships with people other than an opposite-sex spouse undermines the traditional family and that children should be reared in homes with both a father and a mother. As society has become more accepting of homosexuality, there therefore has also been the emergence of many groups that desire to end homosexuality; during the 1990s, one of the best known groups that was established with this goal is the ex-gay movement.|$|E

It {{is to the}} point where he has the innate ability to tell whether or not someone is evil or holds dark intentions just by looking at that person. As such, whenever Kim fights against an evil character (e.g. Geese Howard, Rugal Bernstein etc.), Kim has a special opening pose, in which, he glares menacingly at the evil opponent, and he slowly raises his hand and points at the <b>opponent,</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "Aku wa yurusan!"

2500|$|While the JNF and the ILA view an {{exchange}} of lands as a long-term solution, <b>opponents</b> <b>say</b> that such maneuvers privatize municipal lands and preserve {{a situation in which}} significant lands in Israel are not available for use by all of its citizens. As of 2007, the High Court delayed ruling on JNF policy regarding leasing lands to non-Jews, and changes to the ILA-JNF relationship were up in the air. [...] and other organizations furthermore express concern that proposed severance of the relation between the ILA and JNF, as suggested by Ami Ayalon, would leave the JNF free to retain the same proportion of lands for Jewish uses as it seeks to settle hundreds of thousands of Jews in areas with a tenuous Jewish demographic majority (in particular, 100,000 Jews in existing Galilee communities and 250,000 Jews in new Negev communities via the Blueprint Negev).|$|E
2500|$|Controversy {{surrounding}} the pathologization {{and treatment of}} cross-gender identity and behaviors, particularly in children, has been evident in the literature since the 1980s. Proponents of more widespread GIDC diagnoses argue that therapeutic intervention helps children be more comfortable in their bodies and can prevent adult gender identity disorder. <b>Opponents</b> <b>say</b> that the equivalent therapeutic interventions with gays and lesbians (titled conversion or reparative therapy) have been strongly questioned or declared unethical by the American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association, American Association of Social Workers and American Academy of Pediatrics. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) states that treatment aimed at trying to change a person's gender identity and expression to become more congruent with sex assigned at birth [...] "is no longer considered ethical."

2500|$|<b>Opponents</b> <b>say</b> {{that nuclear}} power poses {{numerous}} threats {{to people and}} the environment and point to studies in the literature that question if it will ever be a sustainable energy source. These threats include health risks, accidents and environmental damage from uranium mining, processing and transport. [...] Along with the fears associated with nuclear weapons proliferation, nuclear power opponents fear sabotage by terrorists of nuclear plants, diversion and misuse of radioactive fuels or fuel waste, as well as naturally-occurring leakage from the unsolved and imperfect long-term storage process of radioactive nuclear waste. They also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong, {{and there have been}} many serious nuclear accidents.
