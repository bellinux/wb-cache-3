5|$|An avid golfer {{and tennis}} player, Graham partnered with New York Yankees great Joe DiMaggio in {{numerous}} golf tournaments later in life. He retired {{to a house}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> <b>course</b> in Florida. Graham overcame colon cancer in 1977, but was later plagued by heart ailments and other health problems.

500|$|The soundtrack {{and musical}} score for Uyarndha Manithan were {{composed}} by M. S. Viswanathan, while the lyrics {{were written by}} Vaali. The soundtrack was released under the label of Saregama. Vaali worked on the film alongside Adimaippen (1969) and felt that working on two films simultaneously was [...] "torrid". In the composition and picturisation for the song [...] "Andha Naal Gnaabagam", Viswanathan was inspired {{by one of the}} songs in My Fair Lady (1964), in which Rex Harrison sings with a walking stick in hand <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> <b>course.</b> Due to T. M. Soundararajan's laughter being inadequate during the recording of this song, Viswanathan himself recorded his own laughter. M.

The song was parodied by Vikram and Vivek in Dhool (2003), and [...] "Paal Polave" [...] was parodied by Santhanam in Yuvan Yuvathi (2011).|$|E
500|$|Howe favoured {{as quick}} a {{transition}} to a peacetime economy as possible. Most industries in which there were not shortages were released from government controls in late 1945. Labour leaders, fearing unemployment, wanted to keep wartime government plants in production; Howe opposed such proposals. When union members who were laid off from the Research Enterprises Limited (R.E.L.) confronted Howe <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> <b>course,</b> the minister stated, [...] "R.E.L. was a war-time plant. The war is through, the plant is through, and your union... what happens to your union is up to you. Get the hell off of the course." [...] In disposing of redundant government property, Howe found that saddles and harnesses had been stored {{since the end of}} the Boer War and men had been employed to safeguard and polish them for over 40 years. He strove to eliminate such anachronisms. [...] However, Howe was slower to release economic controls. According to Roberts, [...] "although he worked to return the country's economic power to private hands, he often seemed as loath to surrender his own dictatorial powers over it as he was to submit to Parliament". [...] In November 1945, Howe's wartime portfolio was merged into his new responsibility to form the Department of Reconstruction and Supply.|$|E

2500|$|Playing a hole <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> <b>course</b> is {{initiated}} {{by putting a}} ball into play by striking it with a club on the teeing ground (also called the tee box, or simply the tee). For this first shot on each hole, it is allowed but not required for the golfer to place the ball on a tee prior to striking it. A tee is a small peg {{that can be used}} to elevate the ball slightly above the ground up to a few centimetres high. Tees are commonly made of wood but may be constructed of any material, including plastic. Traditionally, golfers used mounds of sand to elevate the ball, and containers of sand were provided for the purpose. A few courses still require sand to be used instead of peg tees, to reduce litter and reduce damage to the teeing ground. Tees help reduce the interference of the ground or grass on the movement of the club making the ball easier to hit, and also places the ball in the very centre of the striking face of the club (the [...] "sweet spot") for better distance.|$|E

2500|$|The Stooge films {{made between}} 1935 and 1941 {{captured}} {{the team at}} their peak, according to film historians Ted Okuda and Edward Watz, authors of The Columbia Comedy Shorts. Nearly every film produced became a classic in its own right. Hoi Polloi (1935) adapted the premise of Pygmalion, with a stuffy professor making a bet that he can transform the uncultured trio into refined gentlemen; the plotline worked so well that it was reused twice, as Half-Wits Holiday (1947) and Pies and Guys (1958). Three Little Beers (1935) featured the Stooges running amok <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> <b>course</b> to win prize money. Disorder in the Court (1936) features the team as star witnesses in a murder trial. Violent is the Word for Curly (1938) was a quality Chase-directed short that featured the musical interlude [...] "Swingin' the Alphabet". In A Plumbing We Will Go (1940)—one of the team's quintessential comedies—the Stooges are cast as plumbers who nearly destroy a socialite's mansion, causing water to exit every appliance in the home. Other entries of the era are considered among the team's finest work, including Uncivil Warriors (1935), A Pain in the Pullman (1936), False Alarms (also 1936), Grips, Grunts and Groans (1937), The Sitter Downers (also 1937), Dizzy Doctors (also 1937), Tassels in the Air (1938), We Want Our Mummy (1939), Nutty but Nice (1940), An Ache in Every Stake (1941) and In the Sweet Pie and Pie (also 1941).|$|E
2500|$|Before {{getting the}} job of director, Watts created images of Nick Fury as Parker's mentor in the story in early [...] "mood reels" [...] saying, [...] "I don’t know what the {{situation}} would be, {{but that would be}} a person he’d want to get in trouble with." [...] Feige said the films of John Hughes would be a major influence and that Parker's personal growth and development would be just as important as his role as Spider-Man. He noted that [...] "at that age, in high school, everything feels like life or death." [...] He also said that the film hoped to use one of Spider-Man's rogues that have not been seen in film yet, and that filming would begin in June 2016. In July 2015, it was reported that Marisa Tomei had been offered the role of May Parker, Peter's aunt. It was also revealed that Daley and Goldstein, after missing out on the director role, had begun negotiations to write the screenplay, and were given three days to present Marvel with their pitch; both confirmed shortly after that they had reached a deal to write the screenplay. The pair had proposed a take on the character that was [...] "diametrically opposed" [...] to the previous Spider-Man films, creating a [...] of all the elements seen in those films and actively trying to avoid re-using them in this film. They chose to focus on the high school aspects of the character and [...] "what {{it would be like to}} be a real kid who gets superpowers", rather than the [...] "drama and weight of the tragedy that leads to the origin of Spider-Man". They felt this would differentiate him from the other MCU superheroes as well. Daley called the film [...] "an origin story of him finding his place in the Marvel [...] Universe", with the writing team wanting the film to [...] "focus on [...] coming to terms with his new abilities and not yet being good with them, and carrying with him some real human fears and weaknesses," [...] such as a fear of heights when he has to scale the Washington Monument. Daley noted, [...] "Even within the context of this movie, I don't think you would feel that fear of heights or even the vertigo the audience feels in that scene if you establish him as swinging from skyscrapers at the top of the movie." [...] The writers also wanted to avoid the skyscrapers of Manhattan because of how often they were used in the other films, and instead wrote the character into locations such as [...] "the suburbs, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> <b>course,</b> the Staten Island Ferry, Coney Island, and even Washington D.C." [...] One of the first sequences they pitched was [...] "seeing Spider-Man attached to a plane 10,000 feet up in the air, where he had absolutely no safety net. If you have a character that you’re so familiar with, and you’re familiar with the sort of areas he’s been in, why not turn it on its head and make it something different that people haven’t seen before?" [...] The pair conceded that the film took a more grounded, [...] "low-stakes" [...] approach than previous films, in part to Spider-Man existing in a world with the Avengers, since [...] "if the threat became world-threatening, you would obviously bring in the big guys to handle it." ...|$|E
