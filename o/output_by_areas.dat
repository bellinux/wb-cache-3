40|$|The main aim of {{this article}} is to examine the short-run and long-run impacts of {{urbanization}} and real effective exchange rate on the tourism output of Singapore. This article uses the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds test to examine the relationship between urbanization, inflation, and tourism <b>output</b> <b>by</b> using the time series data for 30 years (1985 – 2015). The findings of this article confirm that a 1 % increase in urbanization will increase tourism <b>output</b> <b>by</b> 132. 87 % in the longrun. A 1 % positive change in urbanization will decrease tourism <b>output</b> <b>by</b> 68. 83 % in the short-run. The findings of this article also confirm that a 1 % increase in the real effective exchange rate will decrease the tourism <b>output</b> of Singapore <b>by</b> 6. 25 % in the long-run. A 1 % positive change in real effective exchange rate will increase tourism <b>output</b> <b>by</b> 2. 23 % in the short-run. This study has implications for policy makers and academics...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate: (i) the {{absorption}} of photo-initiators and emission spectra of light curing units (LCUs); and (ii) the degree of conversion (DC) of experimental composites formulated with different photo-initiators when activated by different LCUs. Blends of BisGMA, UDMA, BisEMA and TEGDMA with camphorquinone (CQ) and/ or 1 -phenyl- 1, 2 -propanedione (PPD) were prepared. Dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) was used as co-initiator. Each mixture was loaded with 65 wt% of silanated filler particles. One quartz-tungsten-halogen - QTH (XL 2500, 3 M/ESPE) and two lightemitting diode (LED) LCUs (UltraBlue IS, DMC and UltraLume LED 5, Ultradent) were used for activation procedures. Irradiance (mW/cm²) was calculated by the ratio of the <b>output</b> power <b>by</b> the <b>area</b> of the tip, and spectral distribution with a spectrometer (USB 2000). The absorption curve of each photo-initiator was determined using a spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 5 G). DC was assessed by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy. Data were submitted to two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (5 %). No significant difference was found for DC values when using LED LCUs regardless of the photo-initiator type. However, PPD showed significantly lower DC values than composites with CQ when irradiated with QTH. PPD produced DC values similar to those of CQ, but it was dependent on the LCU type...|$|R
