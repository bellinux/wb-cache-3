40|$|Purpose: Social {{infrastructure}} {{projects such as}} hospitals are increasingly being procured through public private partnerships (PPP). Due to their complex nature and very high operational requirements, these healthcare projects need special attention in developing robust <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> at the early procurement stage. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present a model framework of <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> for adoption by public sector clients in jurisdictions planning to develop hospital PPP/PFI (Private Finance Initiative) projects. Design/methodology/approach: The research is based on an in-depth analysis of best practices from standard and sample project <b>output</b> <b>specification</b> documents used in Australia and the UK for completed hospital projects, reinforced by interviews with key stakeholders in the two countries. Findings: Drafting <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> for hospital PPP projects is perceived to be a difficult and challenging task due to the complexity and changing needs brought about by evolving health policy, technology and medical advancement. The overarching target of preparing good <b>output</b> <b>specification</b> is to achieve value for money, innovation, risk transfer (including catering for changes), whole life asset performance and establishing performance criteria to link up with the payment mechanism. Practical/implications: The proposed framework is built up from public sector requirements on the physical asset, operational services provided by the private sector, with links to payment mechanism and performance evaluation. It also addresses change mechanism as well as conditions upon hand-over back to the public sector. Originality/value: Unlike traditional projects which are procured using prescriptive specifications, PPP/PFI projects are procured using performance based <b>output</b> <b>specifications.</b> This paper provides the foundation and a model framework for preparing comprehensive <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> based on best practices in Australia and the UK, using hospital as the contextual background.

40|$|Public-private {{partnership}} (PPP) projects specify outputs {{rather than}} inputs. While changes are inevitable over long concession periods, <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> should facilitate {{the negotiation of}} foreseeable changes. An experimental approach based on game theory was adopted {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of different strategies for negotiating changes. A multi-stage bargaining process using the 'z-Tree' software was designed to simulate four change scenarios with three <b>output</b> <b>specification</b> versions encompassing different change management strategies in a computer laboratory. Under each change scenario, pairs of public and private participants negotiated on the sharing of additional costs incurred by changes in the life cycles of fictitious PPP projects based on the different versions of <b>output</b> <b>specification.</b> The time taken to reach settlement or negotiation breakdown was recorded together with the cost-sharing pattern, with feedback collected from the participants on the effectiveness of the specification strategies immediately after the experiment. It was found that a detailed and clear <b>output</b> <b>specification</b> incorporating a cost-sharing framework facilitates change negotiations. Although the first-mover advantage was recorded, the gaps were narrowed in the multi-stage bargains. A similar controlled experiment was conducted with university students for comparison. Findings should lead to improvements in <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> for change negotiation of PPP projects. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R
40|$|Value {{for money}} in a PFI project depends crucially on {{performance}} monitoring to provide incentives for improvement {{and to ensure that}} service delivery is in accordance with the <b>output</b> <b>specification.</b> However, the effectiveness of performance monitoring and <b>output</b> <b>specification</b> cannot be fully assessed until PFI projects become operational. There is a need to examine the role of the performance monitoring mechanism in ensuring that 'value for money' is achieved throughout the delivery of services. Based on semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders from {{the public and private sectors}}, the case studies suggest that there are low levels of performance deductions in PFI projects during the operational phase. However, the complexity of performance measurement, inadequate resources for performance monitoring and the difficulties in the interpretation of the <b>output</b> <b>specification</b> raise questions as to whether the low level of deductions truly reflect the actual level of services delivered. There is also evidence of the public sector forgoing entitled deductions in the 'spirit of partnership' and in exchange for minor contract variations in the <b>output</b> <b>specification.</b> Both the public and private sectors are undergoing a learning process which should lead to improvements in future PFI contracts. Service delivery, performance monitoring, <b>output</b> <b>specification,</b> PFI/PPP projects,...|$|R
40|$|The 3 rd International Postgraduate Conference on Infrastructure and Environment is {{organized}} by the Faculty of Construction & Land Use of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University on 11 and 12 July 2011 in Hong Kong. <b>Output</b> <b>specifications</b> convey the client's requirements on physical assets and services during their operation. A well written set of <b>output</b> <b>specification</b> can induce innovation, bring about increased efficiency and effect appropriate risk transfer from the public {{to the private sector}} in PPP projects. It stipulates what is required from a PPP project in terms of outputs rather than inputs; it states what performance standards are expected to be achieved, the monitoring mechanism and provides links to the payment mechanism. Drafting a clear and concise <b>output</b> <b>specification</b> is always a challenge especially for countries not using standard documents for procuring PPP projects. In this paper, case studies in three different PPPIPFI projects located in Hong Kong, the UK and Singapore are presented for comparing similarities and differences. The aim of this paper is twofold, firstly to examine the issues in drafting <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> in three different types of PPP projects.

40|$|An <b>output</b> <b>specification</b> is an {{integral}} part of the contract documentation for procuring and monitoring public private partnership (PPP) or private finance initiative (PFI) projects throughout their life cycles. Unlike prescriptive specifications used in the traditional project delivery, the <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> stipulate what is required from the project rather than how they should be delivered by the private sector. Performance standards or output parameters are used for bid evaluation and operational monitoring. Failure to achieve them would lead to ongoing payment deduction and rectifications that need to be undertaken within a specified time frame. The long concession periods of PPP/PFI projects mean that changes are inevitable, and these, if foreseeable, should be managed using the <b>output</b> <b>specification</b> as a tool. This unconventional approach of specifying requires special skills and care. This paper presents the results of a questionnaire survey conducted in Australia and the U. K. with PPP/PFI practitioners. The findings highlight the common pitfalls and change management issues encountered by the two jurisdictions, which use PPP or PFI extensively in delivering public assets and services. While common pitfalls include conflicts between input and <b>output</b> <b>specifications,</b> and performance standards being compromised with affordability, small changes are often made by the public sector authorities. Changes are dealt with by anticipatory provisions in <b>output</b> <b>specifications,</b> or negotiations as and when they arise. Procedural hiccups may slow down the process of introducing necessary changes, or give rise to disputes. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R
40|$|Purpose– The {{purpose of}} this paper is to focus on the {{challenges}} faced by the public and private sectors in developing <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> for Australian public private partnership (PPP) projects. In particular, this study aims to examine how the stakeholders (including facilities managers) should cater for future changes in <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> and make them flexible enough to meet the evolving project objectives. Design/methodology/approach– The research is based on 19 semi‐structured interviews with key stakeholders from the public and private sectors in three States of Australia where PPP procurement has been used, including New South Wales (NSW), Queensland and Victoria. The results are triangulated with relevant literature for supports and contrasts. Findings– For PPP projects, a good set of <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> is conducive to the achievement of value for money, innovation, risk transfer, whole life asset performance through a clear abatement regime and an effective linkage of performance criteria to the payment mechanism. For existing specifications, it was found that too many and complex KPIs were specified, which were difficult to monitor, measure and implement by the client. Very prescriptive specifications hindered innovations and did not allow appropriate risk allocation. Further, the research study suggests that after the global financial crises, the private sector had less appetite to take the patronage risks in road and rail PPP projects. To mitigate these pitfalls, it is imperative that <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> need to be aligned with the type of PPP projects they represent; in particular foreseeable changes should be addressed by some pre‐agreed framework to facilitate negotiation. Originality/value– The significant contribution of this research is the identification of the common issues faced in drafting <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> for Australian PPP projects. Stakeholders of future PPP projects should find the lessons useful for achieving value for money and appropriate risk transfer, stating the user requirements through clear and concise <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> rather than input or prescriptive specifications in procuring social and economical PPP projects. Their relationships with facilities management are highlighted. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the improved performance of U. S. bank holding companies from 1991 to 1997. Analysis of cost and profit functions using several alternative <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> {{suggests that the}} gains were primarily due to productivity growth and changes in scale economies. Various econometric methodologies yield productivity growth of about 0. 4 % per year and the optimal size seems to have increased in the 1990 s era of deregulation, technological change, and financial innovation. Estimates of both productivity growth and economies of scale are robust across traditional and non-traditional <b>output</b> <b>specifications.</b> Despite the overall success, however, substantial cost and profit inefficiency existed for bank holding companies of all sizes in the 1990 s. These efficiency estimates are particularly sensitive to the <b>output</b> <b>specification</b> and failure to account for non-traditional activities like off-balance sheet items leads profit efficiency, but not cost efficiency, to be understated for the largest bank holding companies...|$|R

40|$|Linear {{regulators}} have <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> {{far superior to}} switch-mode techniques, except for the overall efficiency. This efficiency limitation can be overcome by applying a very low frequency supercapacitor circulation technique at the input side of a low dropout regulator IC.

With the commercial LDO chips available with output current ratings up to 10 A, and, thin profile supercapacitors available are with DC voltage ratings from 2. 3 V to 5. 5 V, the technique assists developing medium current linear regulators which could compete with present day switch-mode power supplies in efficiency and compactness, maintaining the superior <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> of a linear regulator...|$|R
