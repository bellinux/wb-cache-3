Eight days later, he scored his first goal of the {{campaign}} in the club's 2–1 away win at the Pirelli Stadium against Burton Albion, latching onto Eddie Odhiambo's cross to score from six yards. He started his first game in a 0–0 draw against Stevenage at Broadhall Way in late August 2007, and started once more in a game against Altrincham at Moss Lane a month later, scoring in injury-time to seal a 3–1 victory, having previously assisted the first goal. Odubade's third goal of the campaign came in Oxford's 2–1 home win against Salisbury City, scoring from just inside the area. He also scored a consolation goal for Oxford in the club's 3–1 away loss to relegation candidates Droylsden, as well as scoring twice in the following game as Oxford raced into a three-goal lead against Torquay United, although the game ended 3–3. Odubade scored again against Northwich Victoria in the FA Cup in November 2007, but failed to net again until January 2008 – scoring Oxford's goal in a 3–1 loss away to Salisbury City. After a 0–0 draw against Grays Athletic, a game in which Odubade was substituted on 64 minutes, he failed to start a game for three months. Subsequently, in March 2008, he was transfer-listed by manager Darren Patterson. Shortly after Odubade had been transfer-listed, it was announced that he had played his last game for the club, with Patterson saying [...] "I think the best thing for him and us is that we go <b>our</b> <b>separate</b> ways". However, just a week later, Odubade was told by Patterson that he [...] "must start producing performances" [...] if he wants to be taken off the transfer list. He was taken off of the list after scoring three goals in four games {{at the end of the}} season, as well as starting in the club's last two games of the season. Patterson said that Odubade was removed from the transfer list because [...] "he's now putting in a shift" [...] every game. He finished the season as Oxford's top goalscorer, as Oxford finished the season in ninth place. In total, Odubade played 43 games in all competitions, scoring 11 times as Oxford finished in ninth place.|$|E

In 1999, Alicia Webb (also known as Ryan Shamrock) dated Ken Shamrock until early 2003. Frye made comments to the effect that Shamrock cheated on and divorced his wife to date a young girl (Alicia Webb was 19 and Ken Shamrock was 35 when they started dating). Frye also joked that Ken's (at the time) estranged father Bob and brother Frank would be in Frye's corner for the fight. Ken Shamrock was enraged by Frye's trash talk, causing a feud between Shamrock and Frye. Since then, Frye has stated that he only resorted to personal trash talk to make Ken want to fight him. Frye said: [...] "I saw Ken Shamrock whoop him (Dan Severn) at UFC 6 and I thought, [...] "That's a guy I gotta fight. Anybody who can whoop Dan Severn like that has gotta be a man and I want to test my size against his size. I had the chance to talk trash and they gave me the fight; I crossed the line.

2500|$|William Blake, a Romantic {{poet and}} artist, thought that Wordsworth {{was at the}} same level as the poets Dante, Shakespeare, and Milton. In a diary entry for 27 December 1825, H. C. Robinson recounted a {{conversation}} between himself and William Blake shortly before Blake's death: [...] "I read to him Wordsworth's incomparable ode, which he heartily enjoyed. But he repeated, 'I fear Wordsworth loves nature, and nature is the work of the Devil. The Devil is in us as 'far as we are nature.'... The parts of Wordsworth's ode which Blake most enjoyed were the most obscure—at all events, those which I least like and comprehend." [...] Following Blake, Chauncy Hare Townshend produced [...] "An Essay on the Theory and the Writings of Wordsworth"for Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine in 1829. In the third part, he critiqued Wordsworth's use of pre-existence within the poem and asked [...] "unless our author means to say that, having existed from all eternity, we are of an eternal and indestructible essence; or, in other words, that being incarnate portion of the Deity... we are as Immortal as himself. But if the poet intends to affirm this, do you not perceive that he frustrates his own aim?" [...] He continued by explaining why he felt that Wordsworth's concept fell short of any useful purpose: [...] "For if we are of God's indivisible essence, and receive <b>our</b> <b>separate</b> consciousness from the wall of flesh which, at our birth, was raised between us and the Found of Being, we must, on the dissolution of the body... be again merged in the simple and uncompounded Godhead, lose our individual consciousness... in another sense, become as though we had never been." [...] He concluded his analysis with a critique of the poem as a whole: [...] "I should say that Wordsworth does not display in it any great clearness of thought, or felicity of language... the ode in question is not so much abstruse in idea as crabbed in expression. There appears to be a laborious toiling after originality, ending in a dismal want of harmony." ...|$|E

Yet, achieving scalability while supporting a wide range of complex data structures in a generic way re-mains a long-standing challenge. In this paper, we propose a way to side-step this issue by defining a generic abstract domain combinator for combining mem-ory abstractions on disjoint regions. In essence, our abstract domain construction is to the separating conjunction in separation logic as the reduced product con-struction is to classical, non-separating conjunction. This approach eases the de-sign of the analysis as memory abstract domains can be re-used by applying <b>our</b> <b>separating</b> conjunction domain combinator. And more importantly, this combina-tor enables an analysis designer to easily create a combined domain that applies computationally-expensive abstract domains only where it is required. ...|$|R
