25|$|Pathogenic {{bacteria}} also mimic host motifs (as well {{as having}} their own motifs), however, {{not to the}} same extent as the <b>obligate</b> <b>parasite</b> viruses. E. Coli injects a protein, EspF(U), that mimics an autoinhibitory element of N-WASP into the host cell to activate actin-nucleating factors WASP. The KDEL motif of the bacteria encoded cholera toxin mediates cell entry of the cholera toxin.|$|E
2500|$|The Old World primary {{screwworm}} (Chrysomya bezziana) is an <b>obligate</b> <b>parasite</b> of mammals.

2500|$|The {{entomologist}} E. O. Wilson has characterised parasites as [...] "predators {{that eat}} prey in units {{of less than}} one". Within that scope are many possible ways of life. Parasites are classified {{in a variety of}} different but overlapping schemes, based on their interactions with their hosts and on their life cycles. An <b>obligate</b> <b>parasite</b> is totally dependent on the host to complete its life cycle, while a facultative parasite is not. A direct parasite has only one host while an indirect parasite has multiple hosts. For indirect parasites, {{there will always be a}} definitive host and an intermediate host.|$|E

50|$|The trematodes or flukes include 18,000 to 24,000 species, {{divided into}} two subclasses. Nearly all trematodes are parasites of mollusks and vertebrates. The smaller Aspidogastrea, {{comprising}} about 100 species, are <b>obligate</b> <b>parasites</b> of mollusks and may also infect turtles and fish, including cartilaginous fish. The Digenea, the majority of trematodes, are <b>obligate</b> <b>parasites</b> of both mollusks and vertebrates, but rarely occur in cartilaginous fish.|$|R

50|$|An <b>obligate</b> <b>parasite</b> or holoparasite, is a {{parasitic}} organism that cannot {{complete its}} life-cycle without exploiting a suitable host. If an <b>obligate</b> <b>parasite</b> cannot obtain a host it {{will fail to}} reproduce. This is opposed to a facultative parasite, which {{can act as a}} parasite but does not rely on its host to continue its life-cycle. Obligate parasites have evolved a variety of parasitic strategies to exploit their hosts.|$|E
50|$|Erysiphales are <b>obligate</b> <b>parasites</b> on {{leaves and}} fruits of higher plants, causing {{diseases}} called powdery mildews. Most attempts to grow them in culture have failed.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} <b>obligate</b> {{intracellular}} <b>parasites</b> have evolved mechanisms for evading their hosts cellular defences, including {{the ability to}} survive in distinct cellular compartments.One of the mechanisms that hosts employ {{in their attempt to}} reduce the replication and spread of pathogens is apoptosis (programmed cell death). Some <b>obligate</b> <b>parasites</b> have developed ways to suppress this phenomenon, for example Toxoplasma gondii although the mechanism is not yet fully understood.|$|R

50|$|As an <b>obligate</b> <b>parasite,</b> these wasps do {{not build}} their nests. As a result, the queens will {{hibernate}} longer than their host queens. This {{ensures that the}} nests will be ready when they leave their hibernation spots.|$|E
50|$|Microbotryum violaceum, {{also known}} as the anther smut fungus, was {{formerly}} known as Ustilago violacea. It is a Basidiomycete <b>obligate</b> <b>parasite</b> of many Caryophyllaceae. But it has now separated into many species due to its host specificity.|$|E
