40|$|Construction and setup of twin {{laboratory}} {{gas phase}} reactors with in-line Gas chromatographic analysers was completed. Calibration and C. G. analysis methods development were carried out, and spreadsheet programs were written for {{reduction of data}} to interpretable results. Initial tests were carried out with pentasil zeolite ASM- 5 containing very low (0. 1 %) levels of mercury as potential catalysts for conversion of acetylene/methanol streams to 1, 1 -dimethoxyethane or to C{sub 2 }{sup +} alcohols, both useful as high-oxygenate gasoline blending agents. Trace levels of both types of products were observed, although the predominant products were light olefins at lower reaction temperatures and aromatics at higher temperatures. It is anticipated that less acidic zeolites and/or Zn- containing catalysts will be more active for <b>oxygenate</b> <b>production.</b> Testing of these materials is underway...|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure 3, {{catalytic}} upgrading reduced {{the amount of}} oxygenates due to cracking by the catalysts. In particular, anhydrosugars, which are polymers such as levoglucosan, were cracked into low-molecular-mass species, while aldehydes and ketones were converted into H 2 O by dehydration or into CO and CO 2 by decarbonylation and decarboxylation. It was observed that catalytic upgrading resulted in an increased gas yield, levoglucosan was decomposed completely, {{and the amount of}} carbonyl-containing species was decreased (data not shown). The reduction of total oxygenates due to Meso-MFI and Pt-Meso-MFI was 38 % and 49 %, respectively. Oxygenates degrade the quality of bio-oil by reducing its heating value and producing air pollutants upon combustion. Therefore, a reduction of <b>oxygenate</b> <b>production</b> by catalytic upgrading may help to produce higher-quality bio-oil. In particular, Pt-Meso-MFI showed a higher deoxygenation effect, which is believed to be due to enhanced cracking, dehydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, and hydrocracking reactions over Pt [13].|$|E
40|$|Previous work on iso{{synthesis}} (conversion of {{synthesis gas}} to isobutane and isobutylene) was performed {{at very low}} conversions or extreme process conditions. The objectives of this research were (1) determine the optimum process conditions for isosynthesis; (2) determine the optimum catalyst preparation method and catalyst composition/properties for isosynthesis; (3) determine the kinetics for the best catalyst; (4) develop reactor models for trickle bed, slurry, and fixed bed reactors; and (5) simulate the performance of fixed bed trickle flow reactors, slurry flow reactors, and fixed bed gas phase reactors for isosynthesis. More improvement in catalyst activity and selectivity is needed before isosynthesis can become a commercially feasible (stand-alone) process. Catalysts prepared by the precipitation method show the most promise for future development as compared with those prepared hydrothermally, by calcining zirconyl nitrate, or by a modified sol-gel method. For current catalysts the high temperatures (> 673 K) required for activity also cause the production of methane (because of thermodynamics). A catalyst with higher activity at lower temperatures would magnify the unique selectivity of zirconia for isobutylene. Perhaps with a more active catalyst and acidification, <b>oxygenate</b> <b>production</b> could be limited at lower temperatures. Pressures above 50 atm cause an undesirable shift in product distribution toward heavier hydrocarbons. A model was developed that can predict carbon monoxide conversion an product distribution. The rate equation for carbon monoxide conversion contains only a rate constant and an adsorption equilibrium constant. The product distribution was predicted using a simple ratio of the rate of CO conversion. This report is divided into Introduction, Experimental, and Results and Discussion sections...|$|E

40|$|Propanal (C 2 H 5 CHO) is {{a crucial}} {{intermediate}} oxygenated species in hydrocarbons and oxygenates combustion, thus motivating {{a better understanding of}} its kinetics. In this study, two premixed flat flames of propanal/hydrogen/oxygen/argon, a stoichiometric one (φ = 1. 1) and a rich one (φ = 1. 72), are stabilized at low pressure (27 mbar) on a burner. Species mole fraction profiles have been measured by molecular beam mass spectrometry (M. B. M. S.) for the reactants, products, and intermediate species: C 2 H 5 CHO (propanal), H 2, O 2, Ar, H, OH, HO 2, CO, CO 2, H 2 O, CH 3, CH 4, CH 2 O (formaldehyde), CH 2 CO (ketene), CH 3 CO (acetyl radical), C 2 H 2 (acetylene), C 2 H 4 (ethylene) and C 2 H 6 (ethane). The mechanism from the Universit ́e catholique de Louvain (UCL) has been extended to the kinetics of propanal and its reliability has been validated against both these propanal flames, at low pressure and up to 1530 K. According to the model, the main propanal consumption channel produces the ethyl radical (C 2 H 5). This radical leads to hydrocarbons formation through C 2 H 5 → C 2 H 4 → C 2 H 3 → C 2 H 2; and also, to <b>oxygenated</b> compounds <b>production</b> through C 2 H 5 → CH 3 CHO → CH 3 CO → CH 2 CO → CH 2 CHO.

40|$|A summary is {{presented}} of experimental results {{obtained from a}} Cummins B 5. 9 175 hp, direct-injected diesel engine fueled with oxygenated diesel blends. The oxygenates tested were dimethoxy methane (DMM), diethyl ether, a blend of monoglyme and diglyme, and ethanol. The experimental results show that particulate matter (PM) reduction is controlled largely by the oxygen content of the blend fuel. For the fuels tested, the effect of chemical structure was observed to be small. Isotopic tracer tests with ethanol blends reveal that carbon from ethanol does contribute to soot formation, but is about 50 % less likely to form soot when compared to carbon from the diesel portion of the fuel. Numerical modeling was carried out to investigate the effect of oxygenate addition on soot formation. This effort was conducted using a chemical kinetic mechanism incorporating n-heptane, DMM and ethanol chemistry, along with reactions describing soot formation. Results show that <b>oxygenates</b> reduce the <b>production</b> of soot precursors (and therefore soot and PM) through several key mechanisms. The first {{is due to the}} natural shift in pyrolysis and decomposition products. In addition, high radical concentrations produced by oxygenate addition promote carbon oxidation to CO and CO 2, limiting carbon availability for soot precursor formation. Additionally, high radical concentrations (primarily OH) serve to limit aromatic ring growth and soot particle inception...|$|R
40|$|Microkinetics {{simulations}} {{are presented}} on the intrinsic activity and selectivity of the Fischer-Tropsch reaction {{with respect to}} the formation of long chain oxygenated hydrocarbons. Two different chain growth mechanisms are compared: the carbide chain growth mechanism and the CO insertion chain growth mechanism. The microkinetics simulations are based on quantum-chemical data on reaction rate parameters of the elementary reactions steps of the Fischer-Tropsch reaction available in the literature. Because the overall rate constant of chain growth remains too low the CO insertion chain growth mechanism is not found to produce higher hydrocarbons, except for ethylene and acetaldehyde or the corresponding hydrogenated products. According of the carbide mechanism available quantum-chemical data are consistent with high selectivity to long chain oxygenated hydrocarbon production at low temperature. The anomalous initial increase with temperature of the chain growth parameter observed at such conditions is reproduced. It arises from the competition between the apparent rate of C-O bond activation to produce 2 ̆ 2 CHx 2 ̆ 2 monomers to be inserted into to the growing hydrocarbon chain and rate of chain growth termination. The microkinetics simulations data enable analysis of selectivity changes as a function of critical elementary reaction rates as rate of activation of C-O bond of CO, insertion rate of CO into the growing hydrocarbon chain or rate constant of methane formation. Simulations show that changes in catalyst site reactivity affect elementary reaction steps differently. This has opposing consequences for <b>oxygenate</b> <b>production</b> selectivity, so that an optimizing compromise has to be found. The simulation results are found to be consistent with most experimental data available today. It is concluded that Fischer-Tropsch type catalysis has limited scope to produce long chain oxygenates with high yield, but there is an opportunity to improve yield of C 2 oxygenates...|$|E
40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF JITENDRA GAUTAM, for the Master of Science {{degree in}} MECHANICAL ENGINEERING AND ENERGY PROCESSES, {{presented}} on JUNE 18 TH 2010, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: PARAMETRIC STUDY OF FISCHER-TROPSCH SYNTHESIS IN 			 SUPERCRITICAL PHASE CARBON DIOXIDE MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Kanchan Mondal The results from studies on Fischer Tropsch synthesis wherein syngas was dissolved in CO 2 are presented. The syngas generally used {{was typical of}} that obtained from coal gasification, i. e. CO:H 2 of one. Under these conditions Co-based catalysts without any water gas shift catalyst does not perform well while Fe - based catalysts {{have been found to}} be useful. However, the Fe based catalysts have a propensity towards CO 2 selectivity via the primary FT reaction, Boudouard reaction and the water gas shift reaction. The use of CO 2 as a solvent was found to suppress the CO 2 and CH 4 selectivity while enhancing the hydrocarbon selectivity and CO conversion when FT synthesis was conducted using coal derived syngas on Fe-Zn-K catalysts. The effects were found to be significantly pronounced at pressures higher than or equal to 1200 psig. It should be noted that CO 2 is supercritical at pressures higher than 1070 psig and 31. 4 oC. The effect of CO 2 partial pressure, reactor pressure, reaction temperature, catalyst loading and H 2 :CO ratio in syngas on the liquid product distribution was evaluated. Some of the notable findings include product tenability by varying temperature and pressure as well as varying the CO 2 partial pressure and the syngas composition. Increasing the reactor pressure was found to favor longer chain growth. In addition, it was noted that the ratio between CO 2 :syngas in the reaction mixture is an important factor in the liquid product distribution. A higher value of the ratio is seen to favor hydrocarbon synthesis, while a lower value of the ratio favors <b>oxygenate</b> <b>production</b> particularly pentanols and butanols. In addition, the data on the once through fractionation of the products utilizing the solubilities in supercritical CO 2 and pressure tuning were encouraging. It was found that the products can be easily fractionated into narrow carbon chain length distributions downstream of the reactor by simply reducing the pressures in each collection vessel. It was generally observed that oxygenates and higher n-alkanes were collected in the higher pressure trap and lower hydrocarbons in the subsequent lower pressure traps...|$|E
40|$|Biofuels {{obtained}} from biomass are considered an interesting alternative to fossil derived fuels {{and it has}} been estimated that they could provide about 25 % of global energy requirements. A proper knowledge about their pyrolysis and combustion behavior and the formation of toxic intermediates is necessary. The problem involve a lot of chemical species, so that is has to be afforded systematically. Hydrocarbon pyrolysis and combustion has been mostly characterized but, especially for oxygenated species, such as aldehydes, acid, and alcohols, a lot of work is still to be done. No complete description is given for many secondary gas phase reactions involved in biofuels <b>production.</b> <b>Oxygenated</b> components are one of the major classes of tar compounds released from biomass pyrolysis [1]. Long vapour residence times and temperatures higher than 750 K cause secondary cracking of primary products reducing yields of organic liquids. Lower temperatures lead to condensation reactions and the subsequent formation of lower molecular weight liquids which can also react [2]. There is therefore a growing interest in the successive gas phase reactions of volatile species released from biomass pyrolysis [3]. The importance of molecular paths and four/six center reactions for oxygenated species is well proved by the actual research interest on these topics [4; 5; 6]. An existing and well known kinetic model [7] has been recently compared with experimental data regarding ketene, acetic acid, and acetaldehyde and thank to this activity it has been improved and validated. The importance of concerted path reactions, mainly at high temperatures, is pointed out. The comparison with experimental data is satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|Author(s) 2015. Rapid {{urbanization}} {{and economic}} development in East Asia in past decades has led to photochemical air pollution problems such as excess photochemical ozone and aerosol formation. Asian megacities such as Seoul, Tokyo, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Beijing are surrounded by densely forested areas, and recent research has consistently demonstrated the importance of biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from vegetation in determining oxidation capacity in the suburban Asian megacity regions. Uncertainties in constraining tropospheric oxidation capacity, dominated by hydroxyl radical, undermine our ability to assess regional photochemical air pollution problems. We present an observational data set of CO, NO x, SO 2, ozone, HONO, and VOCs (anthropogenic and biogenic) from Taehwa research forest (TRF) near the Seoul metropolitan area in early June 2012. The data show that TRF is influenced both by aged pollution and fresh biogenic volatile organic compound emissions. With the data set, we diagnose HO x (OH, HO 2, and RO 2) distributions calculated using the University of Washington chemical box model (UWCM v 2. 1) with near-explicit VOC oxidation mechanisms from MCM v 3. 2 (Master Chemical Mechanism). Uncertainty from unconstrained HONO sources and radical recycling processes highlighted in recent studies is examined using multiple model simulations with different model constraints. The results suggest that (1) different model simulation scenarios cause systematic differences in HO x distributions, especially OH levels (up to 2. 5 times), and (2) radical destruction (HO 2 + HO 2 or HO 2 + RO 2) could be more efficient than radical recycling (RO 2 + NO), especially in the afternoon. Implications of the uncertainties in radical chemistry are discussed with respect to ozone-VOC-NO x sensitivity and VOC oxidation product formation rates. Overall, the NO x limited regime is assessed except for the morning hours (8 a. m. to 12 p. m. local standard time), but the degree of sensitivity can significantly {{vary depending on the}} model scenarios. The model results also suggest that RO 2 levels are positively correlated with <b>oxygenated</b> VOCs (OVOCs) <b>production</b> that is not routinely constrained by observations. These unconstrained OVOCs can cause higher-than-expected OH loss rates (missing OH reactivity) and secondary organic aerosol formation. The series of modeling experiments constrained by observations strongly urge observational constraint of the radical pool to enable precise understanding of regional photochemical pollution problems in the East Asian megacity region...|$|R
