5|$|The {{decoration}} {{of the opening}} few words of each Gospel was lavish. These pages were, in effect, turned into carpet pages. The {{decoration of}} these texts is so elaborate that the text itself is almost illegible. The <b>opening</b> <b>page</b> (folio 29r) of Matthew may stand as an example. (See illustration at left.) The page consists of only two words: Liber generationis ("The book of the generation"). The lib of Liber is turned into a giant monogram which dominates the entire page. The er of Liber is presented as an interlaced ornament within the b of the lib monogram. Generationis is broken into three lines and contained within an elaborate frame in the right lower quadrant of the page. The entire assemblage is contained within an elaborate border.|$|E

500|$|Little {{work was}} done on the score during 1897, which Puccini devoted mostly to {{performances}} of La bohème. The <b>opening</b> <b>page</b> of the autograph Tosca score, containing the motif that {{would be associated with}} Scarpia, is dated January 1898. At Puccini's request, Giacosa irritably provided new lyrics for the act 1 love duet. In August, Puccini removed several numbers from the opera, according to his biographer, Mary Jane Phillips-Matz, [...] "cut Tosca to the bone, leaving three strong characters trapped in an airless, violent, tightly wound melodrama that had little room for lyricism". At the end of the year, Puccini wrote that he was [...] "busting his balls" [...] on the opera.|$|E
500|$|In the 1940s and 1950s, when Hergé's {{popularity}} had increased, he and {{his team}} at Studios Hergé redrew many of the original black-and-white Tintin adventures in colour using the [...] ("clear line") drawing style he had developed so that they visually fitted in with the new Tintin stories being created. The Studios reformatted and coloured The Blue Lotus in 1946. Little was actually changed for the 1946 edition, although many of the backgrounds were embellished. Minor alterations included replacing three highland Scotsman who briefly featured in the story with three Sikhs. The map that appears on the <b>opening</b> <b>page</b> was made smaller, while a reference to Sir Malcolm Campbell was removed. The European Palace Hotel was renamed The Continental, while Gibbons' company was also renamed from the Americano-Anglo Chinese [...] Company Limited to American and Chinese Steel Incorporated, and the drug smuggling ship known as the S.S. City of Doodlecastle was renamed the S.S. Harika Maru.|$|E

Also, flappers defended them by contrasting themselves with earlier generations of women whom they called [...] "clinging vines". They mocked the confining fashions and demure passivity of older women and reveled in their own freedom. They did not even acknowledge that the previous generation of female activists had made the flappers' freedom possible.|$|E

6000|$|In September 1821, {{the young}} Gladstone {{was sent to}} Eton. Life at Eton lasted over six years, until the Christmas of 1827. It {{impressed}} images that never faded, and left traces in heart and mind that the waves of time never effaced,--so profound is the early writing on our <b>opening</b> <b>page.</b> Canning's words {{at the head of}} our present chapter set forth a superstition that had a powerful hold on the English governing class of that day, and the new Etonian never shook it off. His attachment to Eton grew with the lapse of years; to him it was ever 'the queen of all schools.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Very young, as is said, self-educated, drudging for {{his daily}} bread in some dreary Glasgow prison-house of brick and mortar, {{he has seen}} the sky, the sun and moon--and, moreover, the sea, report says, for one day in his whole life; and this is nearly the whole of his {{experience}} in natural objects. And he has felt, too painfully for his peace of mind, the contrast between his environment and that of others--his means of culture and that of others--and, still more painfully, the contrast between his environment and culture, and that sense of beauty and power of melody which he does not deny that he has found in himself, and which no one can deny who reads his poems fairly; who reads even merely the <b>opening</b> <b>page</b> and key-note of the whole: ...|$|E

[...] 10 We must not, dare not think, that Heaven began A child, and could not finish him a man; Reflecting what a mighty store was laid Of rich materials, and a model made: The cost already furnish'd; so bestow'd, As more was never to one soul allow'd: Yet after this profusion spent in vain, Nothing but mouldering ashes to remain, I guess not, lest I split upon the shelf, Yet durst I guess, Heaven kept it for himself; [...] 20 And giving us the use, did soon recall, Ere we could spare, the mighty principal.|$|E

6000|$|The exaltation of the <b>opening</b> <b>page</b> of the Confessions is shocking. No monk nor saint ever wrote {{anything}} more revolting in its blasphemous self-feeling. But the exaltation almost instantly became calm, when {{the course of}} the story necessarily drew the writer into dealings with objective facts, even muffled as they were by memory and imagination. The broodings over old reminiscence soothed him, the labour of composition occupied him, and he forgot, as the modern reader would never know from internal evidence, that he was preparing a vindication of his life and character against the infamies with which Hume and others were supposed to be industriously blackening them. While he was writing this famous composition, severed by so vast a gulf from the modes of English provincial life, he was on good terms with {{one or two of the}} great people in his neighbourhood, and kept up a gracious and social correspondence with them. He was greatly pleased by a compliment that was paid to him by the government, apparently through the interest of General Conway. The duty that had been paid upon certain boxes forwarded to Rousseau from Switzerland was recouped by the treasury,[376] and the arrangements for the annual pension of one hundred pounds were concluded and accepted by him, after he had duly satisfied himself that Hume was not the indirect author of the benefaction.[377] The weather was the worst possible, but whenever it allowed him to go out of doors, he found delight in climbing the heights around him in search of curious mosses; for he had now come to think the discovery of a single new plant a hundred times more useful than to have the whole human race listening to your sermons for half a century.[378] [...] "This indolent and contemplative life that you do not approve," [...] he wrote to the elder Mirabeau, [...] "and for which I pretend to make no excuses, becomes every day more delicious to me: to wander alone among the trees and rocks that surround my dwelling; to muse or rather to extravagate at my ease, and as you say to stand gaping in the air; when my brain gets too hot, to calm it by dissecting some moss or fern; in short, to surrender myself without restraint to my phantasies, which, heaven be thanked, are all under my own control,--all that is for me the height of enjoyment, to which I can imagine nothing superior in this world for a man of my age and in my condition."[379] ...|$|E
