40|$|Abstract: In posing Serif Mardin’s {{question}} <b>of</b> <b>Turkey’s</b> center-periphery {{relations in}} a revised version, this article considers secularism to {{be a key}} to understanding Turkish politics. It views the confrontation between secularists and Islamists in the light <b>of</b> <b>Turkey’s</b> center-periphery polarization and identifies the secularist doctrine of Kemalism as a major obstacle to democratic political change. The protection <b>of</b> <b>Turkey’s</b> secular order developed into the ideological cornerstone of Kemalist rule, which ranks prime amongst the ideological tools used to justify the political supremacy of the Turkish armed forces. Examining the interrelation between secularism and the almost religious cult around Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the article concludes that the increasing visibility of Islamic symbols and practices in Turkey is a logical consequence of the country’s current European Union(EU) reform process, rather than a sign <b>of</b> <b>Turkey’s</b> deviation from its political and societal modernization process. </p...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Franco-Syrian War, Turkey annexed the southwestern Anatolian sanjaks (districts) that had been part of Aleppo Vilayet, such as Mar'ash, Gaziantep ('Ayntab), Rumkale (Qal'at Rum), Urfa (al-Ruha). These sanjaks became part <b>of</b> <b>Turkey</b> {{following}} the October 1921 treaty with France. Aleppans opposed the Turkish annexation. The Franco-Turkish treaty allowed for a resumption of commerce between Aleppo and the Alexandretta Sanjak, including Antioch, due to improved security conditions, but commerce between Aleppo and Anatolia largely ceased. Alexandretta was considered by Aleppans to be their port to the Mediterranean Sea and a crucial part of their socio-economic region. It remained part of Syria under French control, but was administered by a semi-autonomous government that was heavily influenced by Turkey. Aleppo's merchants and nationalist politicians feared this autonomy would ultimately lead to its annexation by Turkey and consequently precipitate an economic crisis in Aleppo; Alexnadretta was separated from Syria in 1938 and became part <b>of</b> <b>Turkey</b> in the following year.|$|E
