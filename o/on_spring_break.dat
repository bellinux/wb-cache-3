2500|$|Spring Breakers has {{generated}} debate and controversy among critics, with some regarding {{the film as}} sexist due to its objectification of women, while others viewed the film as a feminist or female empowerment film. In regard to the former perspective, The Guardian suggests that the film [...] "reinforces rape culture" [...] and [...] "turns young women into sex objects", while other reviewers state that it [...] "pushes booze-and-bikini hedonism to the extreme", as the [...] "camera glides up, down and around these women's bodies like a giant tongue." [...] In regard to the latter perspective, the women are not depicted as the film's victims, but arguably as antiheroes, acting {{according to their own}} power and agency. According to Rolling Stone, the film presents [...] "a kind of girl-power camaraderie that could almost be called feminist", a result of the director's intent to [...] "do the most radical work, but put it out in the most commercial way (...) to infiltrate the mainstream". In his review of the film, Richard Roeper wrote [...] "Korine's camera is nearly an intrusive weapon as he lingers over the soft, limber bodies of Vanessa Hudgens, Selena Gomez, Ashley Benson and his wife, Rachel Korine.... I think that's sort of the point. When a pre-med student <b>on</b> <b>spring</b> <b>break</b> loses her top, drinks to the point of passing out and grabs a willing lugnut by the ears for six hours of anonymous fun, is she setting the woman's movement back 40 years, or taking charge of her life like any man would do at that age?" ...|$|E
