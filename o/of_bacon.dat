5|$|Fool's Gold Loaf is a {{sandwich}} {{made by the}} Colorado Mine Company, a restaurant in Denver, Colorado.

5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Recession in 2008â€“2009, this narrowly-defined demographic-based sales plan faltered and sales and profits for the chain declined; Burger King's same-store {{comparable}} sales in the United States and Canada declined 4.6% in the three months ended September 30, while McDonald's posted same-store comparable sales growth of 2.5% within the United States. The Stacker line underwent a minor reformulation in 2011 that involved deleting the top layer of cheese and changing the amount <b>of</b> <b>bacon</b> in the sandwiches, and moving the sandwiches from the core section of its menu to the company's value menu. The changed ingredient list and pricing structure created a situation such that the distribution of ingredients did not scale {{at the same rate as}} increasing numbers of burger patties. Consumer Reports' blog The Consumerist noted that two single Stackers at $1.00 included more cheese and more bacon than one double Stacker for $2.00. Three single Stackers had 50% more cheese and double the bacon of one triple Stacker. The Stacker line and other related calorie-heavy menu items were dropped in 2012 when 3G Capital of Brazil bought the company and initiated a menu restructuring focusing on a broader demographic base.|$|E
