40|$|To {{support the}} coming decade of Mars exploration, NASA is {{establishing}} a telecommunications relay and navigation infrastructure in Mars orbit, supporting increased science data return, providing energy-efficient relays for small scout-class mission concepts, gathering engineering telemetry during critical mission events, and providing in situ radio-based navigation. A key element of this vision is the Electra Proximity Payload, a telecommunications and navigation payload that will fly on each Mars orbiter, beginning with the 2005 Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and with subsequent flight on the 2009 Mars Telecommunications Orbiter (MTO).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Mars Environmental Survey (MESUR) mission is to put in place, over several launch opportunities, a {{constellation}} of Mars landers to make long-term surface observations of the circulation of the atmosphere and changes in climate, and to record the seismic activity of the planetary crust. Short-term objectives will also be addressed. An <b>orbital</b> communications <b>infrastructure</b> capable of providing regular high-rate data transfer to earth from the landers, which are scattered globally from pole to pole, is key to accomplishing the mission goals.

40|$|The space {{industry}} is currently at a significant inflection point. New economies are forming in low- Earth orbit (LEO), driven by miniaturization of technologies {{and the promise}} of lower launch costs, which should then allow many of these LEO systems to capitalize on designs incorporating smaller, shorter-lived spacecraft in highly-disaggregated constellations. Meanwhile, many spacecraft at geosynchronous orbit are continuing along a trend towards increasingly massive and longer-lasting satellites, and while they do represent some of the most exquisite, highest-performing satellites ever launched, some experts now feel that such trends are unsustainable and are beginning to place increasing strain on the underlying industry. To support current and future spacecraft, <b>orbital</b> <b>infrastructures</b> have been proposed as a means of providing on-orbit services to customer spacecraft and guiding space architectures towards more sustainable paradigms. In LEO, an infrastructure of communications and data relay spacecraft is envisioned as a means of aiding new and existing space enterprises in the areas of satellite connectivity and downlink capability. Meanwhile, an on-orbit servicing (OOS) infrastructure, located primarily in geosynchronous orbit, would provide services such as repair, rescue, refueling, and upgrading of customer spacecraft, in order to alleviate the identified {{space industry}} trends. Physics and cost modeling, as well as tradespace exploration, are used to identify optimal LEO infrastructure designs, while system dynamics modeling is used to assess the trends likely to occur in the overall space industry as OOS is incorporated into space architectures. The primary conclusion from the analysis of LEO infrastructure designs is that, when designing for global connectivity, there is an optimal design point between a small constellation of larger spacecraft and a very large constellation of small spacecraft, but this will also depend on the intended mission of the infrastructure and the number of customers expecting to be serviced. Then, for an OOS infrastructure, it is determined that relatively low costs and heavy incorporation of servicing capabilities into customer architectures are needed to ensure long-term sustainability of such a project. Finally, the policy implications for both infrastructure concepts are discussed, with a heavy focus on options for the funding and development regimes employed to implement the infrastructures, as well as the major political and legal implications expected to accompany these projects. by Benjamin L.

40|$|A {{first step}} towards better {{efficiency}} of in-orbit systems {{is the introduction}} of serviceable platforms which, after retrieval and return to Earth, will be refurbished for a follow-on mission. Elements of a permanent <b>orbital</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> however, require in-orbit servicing to ascertain functioning during the entire scheduled operational phase. Moreover, there is an increasing demand for concepts which would alleviate astronaut activities by means of teleoperated or automated, i. e. unmanned, elements. As a general guideline, unmanned servicing elements in the primary phase of development should assume servicing tasks requiring outline manipulations, while EVA tasks requiring cognitive and strategic capabilities should be progressively assigned to unmanned servicing elements. It is the objective to derive technological requirements from the servicing scenarios of <b>orbital</b> <b>infrastructure</b> elements, in order to ascertain high operational efficiency of the infrastructure and payload systems during their entire lifetime by implementing unmanned servicing systems. This concept {{is based on a}} system engineering approach for the functional analysis of a reference concept for in-orbit servicing, in order to define the operational and technological requirements for a prospective servicing element {{on the basis of a}} contemporary model outlook w. r. t. potential technological solutions. To concentrate task definition of a prospective servicing element on evident application scenarios, the reference concept will be restrained to unmanned servicing in low earth orbit. Servicing tasks in other orbits, however, are assumed to be quite similar w. r. t. task definition and technology requirements. (orig.) SIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: D. Dt. F.

40|$|To operate future <b>orbital</b> <b>infrastructure</b> elements, {{concepts}} for unmanned servicing {{have already}} been elaborated in the past. Nevertheless, orbital servicing represents a new in-orbit task which requires a well-timed development of basic system and operational technologies. In 1991, ERNO has set up an approach towards the development and, finally, the application of orbital servicing technologies. As {{the goal of this}} endeavor, a flight demonstration vehicle called DUSE is proposed to accomplish the in-orbit verification of basic servicing technologies. As one conclusion, the programmatic analysis recommends the utilization either of the Space Shuttle Get-Away Special (GAS) canister, or the Progress vehicle for in-orbit transportation of the demonstrator. The main objective of this mission will be to experimentally demonstrate essential servicing technologies such as Rendezvous and Capture, Non-Destructive Inspection and automated proximity maneuvering in close vicinity of a target at a controlled distance from its surface, e. g. contour/terrain following.

The number of missions to Mars at any one time, and over a period of time, is unprecedented in the annals of space exploration. To meet the operational needs of this exploratory fleet will require the implementation of new architectural concepts for communications and navigation. To this end, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has begun to define and develop a Mars communications and navigation <b>orbital</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> This architecture will make extensive use of assets at Mars, as well as use of traditional Earth-based assets, such as the Deep Space Network, DSN.

40|$|The {{next step}} in the human space {{exploration}} is to travel beyond Low Earth Orbit and in this regard the Earth-Moon Lagrangian points represent an interesting and logical first destination. In this paper a discussion about the major aspects related to human expeditions to Librations points is reported. An <b>orbital</b> <b>infrastructure</b> deployed in cis-lunar will represent the first human outpost beyond LEO, to be firstly used as a platform for research and to demonstrate a set of critical technologies and associated operations required to perform a further deep space human exploration mission (e. g. to a NEO or to Mars). As a matter of fact, placing the module in one of the Libration points allows reproducing conditions that would be encountered during a deep space travel, thus guaranteeing the possibility to test specific technologies in a more significant environment with respect to what possible on ground or in LEO (e. g. effects of radiations on human body outside the protection of the Van Allen belts and radiation protection system test). Moreover a station located in one of the Lagrangian points can be exploited to support lunar human exploration missions, providing a staging post and a safe heaven for crew working on the Moon surface. The paper describes the mission concept for the cis-lunar destination, in terms of missions' architectures and needed building blocks also highlighting how this destination concept can be coupled with other destinations missions, in a wider human exploration scenario. Within the paper an assessment of the required and applicable, innovative and critical technologies is reported. In particular, the mission concept is built such that it can in principle be feasible in the following few years (station deployment in 2017), {{but at the same time}} it is conceived to allow a progressive implementation of more and more innovative technologies through different successive missions (e. g. crew missions, logistics missions).

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a habitable module {{to be used}} for long duration space exploration missions. The Deep Space Habitat (DSH) is conceived as a cis-lunar <b>orbital</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and a space-ship for deep space exploration missions. It will represent the first outpost beyond LEO, being deployed at the first Earth-Moon Lagrangian point (EML 1), and is envisaged as a human-tended infrastructure with crew visits periodically foreseen. The DSH has to be firstly used as a platform for research and to demonstrate a set of critical technologies and associated operations required to perform a deep space human exploration mission (e. g. to a NEO). In this regard, placing the module at EML 1 allows reproducing conditions that would be encountered during a travel to an asteroid (or to Mars), thus guaranteeing the possibility to test specific technologies in a more significant environment with respect to what possible on ground or in LEO (e. g. effects of radiations on human body outside the protection of the Van Allen belts and radiation protection system test). Besides being a technology test bed, the DSH will support lunar human exploration missions, providing a staging post and a safe haven for crew working on the Moon surface. The overall architecture of the DSH has derived from a set of system trade-off performed accordingly to the objectives to be accomplished: the most important features are described within the paper. The DSH deployed at EML 1 {{can be seen as a}} first unit to be utilized as a precursor for a habitation module to be actually adopted for hosting the crew during a deep space mission (to a NEO or to Mars). Indeed, a second unit is envisaged, which exploits the experience gained through its precursor, having a common core with it and implementing technologies previously tested on it. Only minor changes shall be envisioned due to the peculiarities of the mission for which it is used. In particular, the description of the second unit presented in the paper refers to a specific reference mission to a NEO lasting one year. The first part of the paper focuses on the main performed trade-offs, as well as the obtained results, in terms of both system architecture and operations, highlighting the major differences between the two envisioned units. The second part is devoted to the critical and enabling technologies, with particular attention to advanced regenerative ECLSS, rapid prototyping and radiation protection syste...|$|E
