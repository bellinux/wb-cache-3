40|$|Processing {{the motivational}} {{relevance}} of a visual scene and reacting accordingly {{is crucial for}} survival. Previous work suggests the emotional content of naturalistic scenes affects response speed, such that unpleasant content slows responses whereas pleasant content accelerates responses. It is unclear whether these effects reflect motor-cognitive processes, such as attentional orienting, or vary with the function/outcome of the motor response itself. Four experiments manipulated participants' ability to terminate the picture (<b>offset</b> <b>control)</b> and, thereby, the response's function and motivational value. Attentive orienting was manipulated via picture repetition, which diminishes orienting. A total of N[*]=[*] 81 participants completed versions of a go/no-go task, discriminating between distorted versus intact pictures drawn from six content categories varying in positive, negative, or neutral valence. While all participants responded faster with repetition, only participants without <b>offset</b> <b>control</b> exhibited slower responses to unpleasant and accelerated responses to pleasant content. Emotional engagement, measured by the late positive potential, was not modulated by attentional orienting (repetition), suggesting that the interaction between repetition and <b>offset</b> <b>control</b> is not due to altered emotional engagement. Together, results suggest that response time changes {{as a function of}} emotional content and sensitivity to attention orienting depends on the motivational function of the motor respons...|$|E

An expert system, ACES (Axial <b>offset</b> <b>Control</b> using Expert Systems) is developed to implement a heuristic constant axial <b>offset</b> <b>control</b> procedure to aid reactor operators in increasing the plant reliability by reducing the human error component of the failure probability;ACES is written in a production system language, OPS 5, based on the forward chaining algorithm. It samples reactor data with a certain time interval in terms of measurable parameters, such as the power, period, and the axial offset of the core. It then processes the core status utilizing a set of equations which are used in a back of the envelope calculations by domain experts. Heuristic rules of ACES identify the control variable to be used among the full and part length control rods and boron concentration, while a knowledge base is used to determine the amount of control;ACES is designed as a set of generic rules to avoid reducing the system into a set of patterns. Instead, ACES evaluates the system, determines the necessary corrective actions in terms of reactivity insertion, and provides this reactivity insertion using the control variables. The amount of control action is determined using a knowledge base which consists of the differential rod worth curves, and the boron reactivity worth of a given reactor. Having the reactor dependent parameters in its knowledge base, ACES is applicable to an arbitrary reactor for axial <b>offset</b> <b>control</b> purposes;ACES has been tested using a one-dimensional core model for verification of the rules and the code.
