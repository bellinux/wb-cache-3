5|$|At {{the age of}} 16, Fischer {{finished}} equal fifth out {{of eight}} (the top non-Soviet player) at the 1959 Candidates Tournament in Bled/Zagreb/Belgrade, Yugoslavia, scoring 12½/28. He was outclassed by tournament winner Tal, who won all four <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>individual</b> games. That year, Fischer released his first book of collected games: Bobby Fischer's Games of Chess, published by Simon & Schuster.|$|E
5|$|How the Scots Invented the Modern World: The True Story of How Western Europe's Poorest Nation Created Our World & Everything in It (or The Scottish Enlightenment: The Scots {{invention}} of the Modern World) is a non-fiction book written by American historian Arthur Herman. The book examines {{the origins of the}} Scottish Enlightenment and what impact it had on the modern world. Following the Great Man approach, Herman focuses on individuals and presents their biographies in the context <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>individual</b> fields and also in terms of the theme of Scottish contributions to the world.|$|E
5|$|Priyanka Chopra {{stars as}} Alex Parrish, a bright FBI recruit who joins the agency {{after graduating from}} the FBI Academy and becomes a prime suspect of a {{terrorist}} attack on Grand Central Terminal. Quantico initially had two timelines: the present, when Parrish flees from captivity to prove her innocence, and the past, with her and her fellow recruits training at the academy and details <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>individual</b> lives are learned. The series switched to a single timeline in mid-second season.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{operational}} doctrine {{developed by the}} RAF, in the circumstance of deploying a large scale nuclear strike, each Victor would have operated entirely independently; the crews would conduct their mission without external guidance and be reliant upon the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>individual</b> tactics to reach and successfully attack their assigned target; thus great {{emphasis was placed on}} continuous crew training during peacetime. Developing a sense of a crew unity was considered highly important; Victor crews would typically serve together for at least five years, and a similar approach was adopted with ground personnel. In order to maximise {{the operational}} lifespan of each aircraft, Victor crews typically flew a single five-hour training mission per week. Each crew member was required to qualify for servicing certificates to independently undertake inspection, refuelling and turnaround operations.|$|E
5|$|Carlsen {{then went}} on to finish second in the Biel Grandmaster Tournament, with 18 points, just one point behind Wang Hao using the 3–1–0 scoring system. As in the Tal Memorial earlier in 2012, Carlsen managed to finish the tournament without any losses (+4−0=6). He also {{defeated}} the winner Wang in both <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>individual</b> games. In the exhibition blitz tournament at Biel before the GM tournament, Carlsen was eliminated (+1−2=0) in the first round by Étienne Bacrot. Bacrot deprived Carlsen of a win in the classical tournament by holding him to a draw in the final round. Carlsen would have won the classical tournament on the traditional 1–½–0 scoring system, with 7/10.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of a constant rate infusion of medetomidine in the cortical brain activity and hemodynamic parameters in sevoflurane anesthetized puppies. Six puppies of the age of two weeks old were included in the study and were anaesthetized three times with sevoflurane. On the first anesthesia, each dog’s minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for sevoflurane was determined by the use of the tail clamp method. On the second anesthesia (sevoflurane), the puppies were anesthetized at each of five multiples <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>individual’s</b> MAC, 0. 75, 1, 1. 25, 1. 5 and 1. 75 MAC, and bispectral index and cardiorespiratory parameters were registered. On the third anesthesia (sevoflurane+ medetomidine), puppies were anesthetized at each of five multiples <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>individual’s</b> MAC, and medetomidine (5 µg/kg+ 2 µg/kg/h) was administered. Mild cardiovascular depression was observed in sevoflurane+medetomidine in comparison with sevoflurane. Cortical and antinociceptive effects were not observed with medetomidine infusion although a mature EEG response to noxious stimulation would not have developed in puppies. Central alpha- 2 adrenoreceptors would be immature in puppies during the first two weeks of life, and for this reason, medetomidine would not produce sedative and analgesic effects in young puppies. More studies have to be performed to support this statement...|$|R

25|$|Scholars {{debate whether}} hair-straightening {{practices}} arose out of Black desires {{to conform to}} a Eurocentric standard of beauty, or as part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>individual</b> experiments with fashions and changing styles.

Ayana Byrd and Lori Tharp say that they believe the preference for Eurocentric ideas of beauty still pervades the Western world.|$|E
25|$|When {{assaying}} epistasis {{within a}} gene, site-directed mutagenesis {{can be used}} to generate the different genes, and their protein products can be assayed (e.g. for stability or catalytic activity). This is sometimes called a double mutant cycle and involves producing and assaying the wild type protein, the two single mutants and the double mutant. Epistasis is measured as the difference between the effects of the mutations together versus the sum <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>individual</b> effects. This can be expressed as a free energy of interaction.|$|E

Moreover, these combination analgesics can often result in significant adverse events, including accidental overdoses, most often due to confusion that arises from the multiple (and often non-acting) components of these combinations.|$|E
