5|$|Before 1707, the Kingdom of Scotland was a {{sovereign}} independent state {{which had its}} own legislature—the Parliament of Scotland—which met, latterly, at Parliament House on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. The Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Union,</b> signed in 1707, created an incorporating political union between the Kingdom of Scots and the Kingdom of England. The two previous Acts <b>of</b> <b>Union</b> (one for the British Parliament {{and one for the}} Parliament of Scotland) had dissolved the previous parliaments. The Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Union</b> created the Parliament of Great Britain which was housed in the Palace of Westminster in London. As a consequence, Scotland was directly governed from London for the next 292 years without a legislature or a Parliament building of its own.|$|E

5|$|In 1754, the Stadt Huys was {{the site}} of the Albany Congress; Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania {{presented}} the Albany Plan <b>of</b> <b>Union</b> there. This was the first formal proposal to unite the British American colonies. The Plan of Union's original intention was to unite the colonies in defense against aggressions of the French to the north; it was not an attempt to become independent from the auspices of the British crown. Although it was never adopted by the British Parliament, it was an important precursor to the United States Constitution. A month prior to the meeting, Franklin published his Join, or Die political cartoon, an infamous graphical representation of the Plan <b>of</b> <b>Union.</b>|$|E

In 1801, Great Britain was united with the Kingdom of Ireland through another Act <b>of</b> <b>Union</b> to become the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922 the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom, leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} Lawrence, {{the guerrillas}} immediately killed a number <b>of</b> <b>Union</b> Army recruits {{and one of}} Anderson's men took their flag. The Provost Marshal of Kansas, a Union captain who commanded military police, surrendered to the guerrillas and Anderson took his uniform. (Guerrillas often wore uniforms stolen from Union soldiers.) They proceeded to pillage and burn many buildings, killing almost every man they found, but {{taking care not to}} shoot women. Anderson personally killed 14 people. Although some men begged him to spare them, he persisted, but he relented when a woman pleaded with him not to torch her house. The guerrillas under Anderson's command, notably including Archie Clement and Frank James, killed more {{than any of the other}} group. They left town at 9a.m., after a company <b>of</b> <b>Union</b> soldiers approached the town. The raiding party was pursued by Union forces, but eventually managed to break contact with the soldiers and scatter into the Missouri woods. After a dead raider was scalped by a Union-allied Lenape Indian during the pursuit, one guerrilla leader pledged to adopt the practice of scalping.|$|E
5|$|After the Act <b>of</b> <b>Union</b> 1800, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Act <b>of</b> <b>Union</b> 1801, the unreformed House of Commons was composed of 658 members, of whom 513 represented England and Wales. There were two types of constituencies; counties and boroughs. County members were supposed to represent landholders, while borough members were supposed to represent the mercantile and trading interests of the kingdom. Counties were historical national subdivisions established between the 8th and 16th centuries. They were not merely parliamentary constituencies: many components of government (including courts and the militia) were organised along county lines. The members of Parliament chosen by the counties were known as Knights of the Shire. In Wales each county elected one member, while in England each county elected two members until 1826, when Yorkshire's representation was increased to four, following the disenfranchisement of the Cornish borough of Grampound.|$|E

This spate of military building culminated in the construction of Fort George near Inverness (1748–69), with its projecting bastions and redoubts.|$|E
