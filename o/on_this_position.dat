5|$|The siege {{was broken}} in March 1776 when Continental Army Colonel Henry Knox brought heavy {{artillery}} from Fort Ticonderoga to Boston during the winter, and General Washington {{used them to}} fortify Dorchester Heights, overlooking Boston and its harbour.

On 17 March, British troops and Loyalists evacuated the city, and sailed for Halifax, Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Clark {{worked as}} the {{assistant}} to the entomologist on probation in the Western Australian Department of Agriculture, but in 1920, he took <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>position</b> full-time. He started to publish his first articles about pest insects and ants from 1921; in 1926 he became an entomologist at the National Museum in Melbourne, remaining there for 20 years. Clark continued to publish more articles until he resigned from the National Museum of Victoria in 1944. Living in poverty, Clark lived a reclusive life, publishing his last book in 1951. He died on 1 June 1956 {{at the age of}} 71, survived by his six children. One of Clark's most notable achievements was describing Nothomyrmecia macrops, the most primitive living ant.

5|$|In early January 1945, the American force {{determined}} that two battalions of the Japanese 211th Regiment were at Hill 40, about four miles (6km) {{north of the}} Allied perimeter. The attack <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>position</b> began on 3 January 1945 when the 136th Infantry Regiment's 1st and 2nd battalions advanced from the south-west and encountered strong resistance. The regiment used a large quantity of ammunition in this attack, and aerial resupply was needed to replenish its supplies. Both American battalions resumed their attack {{the next day with}} the support of a highly effective artillery bombardment, and reached the main Japanese position in the afternoon. During this period the 3rd Battalion of the 136th Regiment advanced on Hill 40 from the north, and destroyed the 211th Regiment's 3rd Battalion in a series of battles. This Japanese battalion had been stationed on the coast to receive supplies from Halmahera and mounted several unsuccessful attacks on the American battalion's beachhead after it landed in December.|$|E

25|$|That {{morning it}} was too hazy to flash a message to Broadwood, so Clements was entirely on his own. Meanwhile, De la Rey and Smuts had managed to capture all the kopjes in the Moot except one, Yeomanry Hill (Hartebeestfontein). Clements alertly and swiftly {{concentrated}} his survivors <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>position.</b> At 8:00 am, the British drove away a group of Boers who had gained a foothold on Yeomanry Hill.

25|$|During {{the retreat}} to Edea, German forces damaged the railway bridge at Yapoma, just outside Duala. A small German {{detachment}} remained entrenched {{on the far}} side of the Dibamba River at the damaged bridge while the majority of the force had retreated to Edea. The German control of the bridge was seen as a great danger to the Allied occupation of Duala due to Japoma's close proximity to the town. On 6 October, a French force of 400 tirailleurs under Colonel Mayer assisted by British naval bombardment made an assault <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>position.</b> The French troops crossed the bridge under severe fire from the entrenched German force who withdrew. Securing the partially damaged railway bridge made a push to Edea, further to the southeast, possible.|$|E
25|$|Ochterlony {{chose his}} target, {{a point on}} the ridge, and then {{proceeded}} to move slowly, consolidating each position that he took, and allowing the pioneers time to build roads so that the heavy guns could be moved forward to support each attack.

The old warrior Bhakti Thapa valiantly led assault after assault <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>position,</b> but he died during battle and the position did not fall. Immensely impressed by Bhakti's sustained courage against impossible odds, the British made the well appreciated and honorable gesture of returning his body with full military honours.

25|$|I {{never did}} {{know exactly what}} was meant by the term 'The Beats', but let's say that the {{original}} meeting, association, comradeship of Allen , myself, Michael , Lawrence , Philip Whalen, who's not here, Lew Welch, who's dead, Gregory , for me, to a somewhat lesser extent (I never knew Gregory {{as well as the}} others) did embody a criticism and a vision which we shared in various ways, and then went our own ways for many years. Where we began to come really close together again, in the late '60s, and gradually working toward this point, it seems to me, was when Allen began to take a deep interest in Oriental thought and then in Buddhism which added another dimension to our levels of agreement; and later through Allen's influence, Lawrence began to draw toward that; and from another angle, Michael and I after the lapse of some years of contact, found our heads very much in the same place, and it's very curious and interesting now; and Lawrence went off in a very political direction for a while, which none of us had any objection with, except that wasn't my main focus. It's very interesting that we find ourselves so much on the same ground again, after having explored divergent paths; and find ourselves united <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>position</b> of powerful environmental concern, critique of the future of the individual state, and an essentially shared poetics, and only half-stated but in the background very powerfully there, a basic agreement on some Buddhist type psychological views of human nature and human possibilities.|$|E

In response to a Japanese counter-attack, the 26th Brigade was transferred to reinforce the Australian position on 20 October and, when the division switched to the offensive in November, the brigade was ordered to capture Sattelberg.

500|$|As {{orders were}} passed {{for an attack}} to be made <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>{{position}},</b> the 14th/32nd was brought up to relieve the 19th. The Japanese position sat atop a [...] hill which rose steeply, up to 45 degrees in some places, from the jungle below. In preparation, the 14th/32nd occupied a number of positions around Bacon Hill and at 9:55am on 16 March 1945 the attack began with two companies, 'B' and 'D', attacking {{under the cover of}} an intense artillery barrage provided by elements of the 2/14th Field Regiment, with direct fire support being provided by 'A' and 'C' Companies from the high ground surrounding the hill. The Japanese defences were well-prepared though, and machine-gun and mortar fire from well-sited positions soon pinned down two platoons from 'B' Company. In order to regain momentum, a flanking move to the left was undertaken by 'D' Company, but after two hours they too came under intense machine-gun fire as they attempted to round Mount Sugi and attack the Japanese from the rear, forcing them to dig-in to the north of Bacon Hill. At this point the situation became quite desperate for the attackers, and a number of Australian platoons found themselves embroiled in an intense battle. Finally, late in the day, after having lost 10 men killed and another 13 wounded the attack was called off. The attack was resumed early the following day with two companies attacking from the north and digging-in on the eastern approaches to the hill while two platoons clambered up the steep western slope amidst heavy Japanese mortar and grenade attacks. By nightfall the Australians, who had lost a further six men killed and 17 wounded, were in control of most of the position, although two Japanese positions were still holding out. On 18 March the attack was resumed and finally, by 3:00pm, the last Japanese had been cleared from the hill.|$|E
