5|$|About 5% of {{all people}} are {{diagnosed}} only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, <b>often</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of a hemolytic anemia (anemia due {{to the destruction of}} red blood cells). This leads to abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, the person develops hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma, seizures and finally life-threatening swelling of the brain).|$|E
5|$|Another unusual feature {{found in}} the abyssal and hadal zones is the cold seep, {{sometimes}} called a cold vent. This {{is an area of}} the seabed where seepage of hydrogen sulfide, methane and other hydrocarbon-rich fluid occurs, <b>often</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of a deep-sea brine pool. The first cold seeps were discovered in 1983, at a depth of 3200meters in the Gulf of Mexico. Since then, cold seeps have been discovered in many other areas of the World Ocean, including the Monterey Submarine Canyon just off Monterey Bay, California, the Sea of Japan, off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, off the Atlantic coast of Africa, off the coast of Alaska, and under an ice shelf in Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|As of 2000, {{the median}} intake of iodine from {{food in the}} United States was 240 to 300μg/day for men and 190 to 210μg/day for women. The general US {{population}} has adequate iodine nutrition, with {{women of childbearing age}} and pregnant women having a possible mild risk of deficiency. In Japan, consumption was considered much higher, ranging between 5,280μg/day to 13,800μg/day from dietary seaweed or kombu kelp, <b>often</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of Kombu Umami extracts for soup stock and potato chips. However, new studies suggest that Japan's consumption is closer to 1,000–3,000μg/day. The adult UL in Japan was last revised to 3,000µg/day in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Both {{male and}} female mockingbirds sing, with the latter being {{generally}} quieter and less vocal. Male commencement of singing is in late January to February and continues into the summer and the establishing of territory into the fall. Frequency in female singing is more sporadic, as it sings less <b>often</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer and fall, and only sings when the male is away from the territory. The mockingbird also possesses a large song repertoire that ranges from 43 to 203 song types and the size varies by region. Repertoire sizes ranged from 14 to 150 types in Texas, and two studies of mockingbirds in Florida rounded estimates to 134 and 200, approximately. It continually expands its repertoire during its life, though it {{pales in comparison to}} mimids such as the brown thrasher.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{the term}} {{rhythm and blues}} had no longer been in wide use; instead, terms like soul music were used to {{describe}} popular music by black artists.

Contemporary R arose when sultry funk singers like Prince became very popular, alongside dance-oriented pop stars like Michael Jackson and Madonna.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning {{is relatively}} common, resulting {{in more than}} 20,000 emergency room visits {{a year in the}} United States.

Poisonings occur more <b>often</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter, particularly from the use of portable generators during power outages. The toxic effects of CO have been known since ancient history. The realization that hemoglobin was affected by CO was determined in 1857.|$|E
