From ¥221 in 1981, the average value of the yen actually dropped to ¥239 in 1985. The rise in the current account surplus generated stronger demand for yen in foreign-exchange markets, but this trade-related demand for yen was offset by other factors. A wide differential in interest rates, with United States interest rates much higher than those in Japan, and the continuing moves to deregulate the international flow of capital, led to a large net <b>outflow</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> from Japan. This capital flow increased the supply of yen in foreign-exchange markets, as Japanese investors changed their yen for other currencies (mainly dollars) to invest overseas. This kept the yen weak relative to the dollar and fostered the rapid rise in the Japanese trade surplus that took place in the 1980s.|$|E

During the 1950s {{and the first}} half of the 1960s, when Japan faced chronic current account deficits, concern over maintaining a high credit rating in international capital markets and fear of having to devalue the currency and of foreign ownership of Japanese companies all led to tight controls over both inflow and <b>outflow</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> As part of these controls, for example, government severely restricted foreign direct investment in Japan, but it encouraged licensing agreements with foreign firms to obtain access to their technology.

Financial development raises the loan rate but has a non-monotonic effect on the equity return.

However, the direction of foreign direct investment (FDI, henceforth) depends on the exact degrees of financial development {{in the two countries}} as well as the specific capital controls policy. Our model helps explain the Lucas Paradox (Lucas, 1990).

40|$|Purpose – Most investors' {{retirement}} portfolios have inter-period cash inflows. The standard time-weighted mean return (or {{geometric mean}} return) is generally used to report returns on investors' retirement portfolios. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to examine the standard time-weighted mean return and point out additional deficiencies in the time-weighted mean in this situation, which have not been addressed in the literature. Design/methodology/approach – The paper provides examples that point out additional deficiencies that arise using geometric mean returns as estimates of an individual investor's performance. Findings – With inter-period cash flows the dollar-weighted return can be affected by both timing and the sequence of the asset return series even if the investor has constant inflows or <b>outflows</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> In contrast for these same asset return arrays, the time-weighted mean return measure may be unaffected by these important variations in the return arrays, and thus may misrepresent actual investor results.

50|$|Securitization {{allows the}} banks to quickly relend {{the money to}} other borrowers (including {{in the form of}} {{mortgages}}) and thereby to create more mortgages than the banks could with the amount they have on deposit. This in turn allows the public to use these mortgages to purchase homes, something the government wishes to encourage. Investors in conforming loans, meanwhile, gain low-risk income at a higher interest rate (essentially the mortgage rate, minus the cuts of the bank and GSE) than they could gain from most other bonds. Securitization has grown rapidly in the last 10 years {{as a result of the}} wider dissemination of technology in the mortgage lending world. For borrowers with superior credit, government loans and ideal profiles, this securitization keeps rates almost artificially low, since the pools of funds used to create new loans can be refreshed more quickly than in years past, allowing for more rapid <b>outflow</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> from investors to borrowers without as many personal business ties as in the past.|$|E
40|$|International {{capital flows}} from rich to poor {{countries}} {{can be regarded}} as either too small (the Lucas paradox in a one-sector model) or too large (when compared with the logic of factor price equalization in a two-sector model).

In our model, free trade in goods does not imply equal returns to capital across countries. In addition, rich patterns <b>of</b> gross <b>capital</b> flows emerge as a function of financial and property rights institutions.

40|$|We {{argue that}} a chronic US current account deficit is an {{integral}} and sustainable feature of a successful international monetary system. The US deficit supplies international collateral to the periphery. International collateral in turn supports two-way trade in financial assets that liberates capital formation in poor countries from inefficient domestic financial markets. The implicit international contract is analogous to a total return swap in domestic financial markets. Using market-determined collateral arrangements from these transactions we compute the collateral requirements consistent with recent foreign direct investment in China. The data are remarkably consistent with such calculations.

The intermediaries’ role of transforming maturities is shown to result in larger movements of capital and a higher probability of crisis.

The model highlights how adverse productivity and international interest rate shocks may trigger a sudden <b>outflow</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> and an exchange collapse. The initial shock is magnified by the behavior of individual foreign investors linked through their deposits in the intermediaries. The expectation of an eventual exchange rate crisis links investors’ behavior even further. ...|$|E
40|$|The main {{conclusions}} of the thesis are that pension reform can be welfare improving if losses and benefits are redistributed by the central government.

Plunging real estate values accompanied by severe difficulties in the banking and financial sector have been common occurrences across the region.
