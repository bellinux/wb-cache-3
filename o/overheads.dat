5|$|From 1919 to 1922, Kesselring {{served as}} a battery {{commander}} with the 24th Artillery Regiment. He joined the Reichswehr on 1 October 1922 and was posted to the Military Training Department at the Reichswehr Ministry in Berlin. He remained at this post until 1929, {{when he returned to}} Bavaria as commander of Wehrkreis VII in Munich. In his time with the Reichswehr Ministry, Kesselring was involved in the organisation of the army, trimming staff <b>overheads</b> to produce the best possible army with the limited resources available. He helped reorganise the Ordnance Department, laying the groundwork for the research and development efforts that would produce new weapons. He was involved in secret military manoeuvres held in the Soviet Union in 1924 and in the so-called Great Plan for a 102-division army, which was prepared in 1923 and 1924. After another brief stint at the Ministry of the Reichswehr, Kesselring was promoted to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) in 1930 and spent two years in Dresden with the 4th Artillery Regiment.|$|E

30|$|Figures 4 and 5 {{show the}} reward {{performance}} versus the inter-cell inter-relay handoff <b>overhead</b> for v 0 = 100 m/s and 50 m/s, respectively. These figures {{also show that}} the proposed handoff method achieves the highest reward {{over a wide range}} of the handoff <b>overhead</b> values. The reward performance of all the four handoff methods degrades with the handoff <b>overhead.</b> That is, high <b>overhead</b> can discourage the user for switching to the RS with better channel quality. As the <b>overhead</b> is relatively low, the proposed method achieves much higher reward than all the other three methods, because it takes into account the effects of both the <b>overhead</b> and the moving speed on the reward function. It is also noticed that the conventional method achieves better reward than the <b>overhead</b> method when the <b>overhead</b> is relatively low; as the <b>overhead</b> for performing the handoffs increases, the rewards of the proposed method and the <b>overhead</b> method outperform the conventional one {{due to the fact that}} the effect of the <b>overhead</b> becomes increasingly larger. Without considering the handoff <b>overhead</b> and the moving speed, using the conventional method to make inter-relay handoff decisions results in the worse reward performance among all the four methods.|$|R
40|$|In {{the modern}} era, <b>overhead</b> {{transmission}} lines become irrelevant {{in the development}} of new cities as underground cables become mandatory. Nonetheless, it is crucial to understand <b>overhead</b> line technology in order to model the next generation of power networks, as most of the power networks still comprise <b>overhead</b> lines. This field of study was exposed to methodical and thorough research; there is a common perspective which is shared amongst multinational power engineers and researchers, that underground transmission cabling bestows mammoth improvements & benefits when compared to its predecessor technology of <b>overhead</b> lines. However, the <b>overhead</b> technology is still dominating and is in use all over the world. A comprehensive overview of the <b>overhead</b> power network along with its structure was dedicatedly elaborated on. For decades, power has been transmitted via a relatively low cost medium, commonly known as <b>overhead</b> lines. Since then, substantial transformations have been occurring to improve the reliability of <b>overhead</b> networks.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The U. S.

At the foundation of this process, Corps policy establishes two categories of costs to calculate <b>overhead</b> [...] general and administrative <b>overhead</b> expenses associated with district administrative offices, such as resource management, and technical <b>overhead</b> expenses associated with district technical offices, such as engineering. Using these two categories as a starting point, the Corps next calculates <b>overhead</b> rates {{as part of its}} annual budget process. Specifically, each district administrative and technical office develops operating budgets with <b>overhead</b> estimates, which are then consolidated and routed through district and division management, resulting in a final division-wide operating budget and <b>overhead</b> rates. The Corps then bills projects for <b>overhead</b> costs {{based on the number of}} hours its staff charge to projects. <b>Overhead</b> charges are not applied to hours worked by contracted labor, which represent a substantial amount of work. The Corps reports that it contracts out most of its design work and all of its construction work to private sector entities, such as architectural and engineering firms and construction companies. Finally, the Corps periodically monitors <b>overhead</b> costs and makes any necessary adjustments such as changing <b>overhead</b> rates, reducing expenditures, or providing rebates to customers. The Corps is able to monitor <b>overhead</b> because it tracks <b>overhead</b> costs separately from other project costs in its financial management system through specific <b>overhead</b> accounting codes. ...|$|R

Pan Am was vulnerable, with its high <b>overheads</b> and fixed costs {{as a result of}} a large decentralized infrastructure. High fuel prices and its many older, less fuel-efficient narrowbodied airplanes increased the airline's operating costs.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} the <b>overhead</b> incurred by programs {{that can be}} updated dynamically and argue that, in general, and regardless of the mechanism used, the program must incur an <b>overhead</b> during normal execution. We argue that the <b>overhead</b> during normal execution of the updateable program need not {{be as high as}} the <b>overhead</b> for the updated program. In light of the fundamental limitations and the differences in the <b>overhead</b> that must be incurred by the updateable and updated programs, we propose a new mechanism for dynamic software update based on a new shifting gears approach. The mechanism attempts to incur just the required <b>overhead</b> depending on the stage of update the application is in. Before an update the execution incurs low <b>overhead</b> and when an update occurs the execution incurs higher <b>overhead</b> which reverts to low <b>overhead</b> as the execution progresses. We evaluate the mechanism by modifying an application by hand. Preliminary performance numbers show that the mechanism performs better than existing mechanisms for dynamic software update. I...|$|R
40|$|Predetermined <b>overhead</b> rate {{is based}} on {{estimates}} rather than actual result. This is because the predetermined <b>overhead</b> rate is computed before the period begins and is used to apply <b>overhead</b> cost throughout the period. Companies typically base their predetermined <b>overhead</b> rates on the estimated, or budgeted, amount of allocation base (cost drivers) for the upcoming period. The purpose {{of this research is}} to compare PT Kusumahadi Santosa’s predetermined <b>overhead</b> rate based on the traditional costing with those rate computes or bases on the activity-based costing (ABC). PT Kusumahadi Santosa’s manufacturing <b>overhead</b> cost data (primary data) is used to reach the purpose. PT Kusumahadi Santosa is the manufacturer that process threads into cloth materials. The result of this research as follows. PT Kusumahadi Santosa’s applied <b>overhead</b> cost base on predetermined <b>overhead</b> rates computes on the traditional costing (uses machine hours allocation base) is Rp 51. 324, 044, 510, 00, while those applied <b>overhead</b> cost based on predetermined <b>overhead</b> rates computes on ABC is Rp 53. 926. 959. 944, 00.
