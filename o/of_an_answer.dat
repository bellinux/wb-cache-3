25|$|The {{discussion}} of the particular miracles proceeded {{in exactly the same}} way and in the same order as that of the virtues. If the decisions were favourable, the general meeting of the Congregation was followed by a decree, confirmed by the Pope, in which it was announced that there was proof of miracles. In the positio for the ante-preparatory congregation there were required and were printed opinions of two physicians, one of whom had been chosen by the Postulator and the other by the Congregation of Rites. Of the three reports (positiones) above mentioned, and which were now also required, the first was prepared in the usual way; the second consisted of an exposition of the heroic virtues of the servant of God, an information, and a reply to later observations of the Promotor of the Faith; the last consisted only <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> to his final observations.|$|E

[...] A null value indicates a lack of a value - a lack of a value is not the same thing as a value of zero in the same way that a lack <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> is not the same thing as an answer of [...] "no". [...] For example, consider the question [...] "How many books does Adam own?" [...] The answer may be [...] "zero" [...] (we know that he owns none) or [...] "null" [...] (we do not know how many he owns). [...] In a database table, the column reporting this answer would start out with no value (marked by Null), and it would not be updated with the value [...] "zero" [...] until we have ascertained that Adam owns no books.|$|E
500|$|Cornfoot's lynching {{had taken}} place with unequivocal support from Cowper– {{members of his family}} had participated– {{together}} with assistance from high-ranking members of the burgh; it would not have succeeded without their approval. Public reaction {{in the immediate aftermath of}} Cornfoot's death was diverse. An anonymous letter was published from an individual using the pen name of [...] "A Gentleman from Fife"; under the [...] heading <b>of</b> <b>An</b> <b>Answer</b> of a Letter from a Gentleman in Fife to a Nobleman he opined that Morton was a fraud, the treatment of the women was [...] "barbarous" [...] and their incarceration [...] "unwarrantable". He added that he considered Thomas Brown was murdered by starvation and that Brown and Cornfoot had been denied Christian burials. The letter indicated responsibility for the events, including the lynching, was the fault of the minister and the bailies. Details of Cornfoot's lynching were given by [...] "A Gentleman from Fife" [...] in a further pamphlet, dated 5 February 1705, entitled An Account of an horrible and barbarous murder. [...] "A Lover of Truth" [...] responded with another essay, A Just Reproof to the False Reports and Unjust Calumnies in the Forgoing Letters, asserting officials had not transgressed and challenging the claims made.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} James Bond {{was introduced}} towards, but not at, {{the beginning of}} the film in a [...] "now-famous nightclub sequence featuring Sylvia Trench", to whom he makes his [...] "immortal introduction". The introduction to the character in Le Cercle at Les Ambassadeurs, an upmarket gambling club, is derived from Bond's introduction in the first novel, Casino Royale, which Fleming had used because [...] "skill at gambling and knowledge of how to behave in a casino were seen... as attributes of a gentleman". After losing a hand of Chemin de Fer to Bond, Trench asks his name. There is the [...] "most important gesture ... the way he lights his cigarette before giving her the satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer.</b> 'Bond, James Bond'." [...] Once Connery says his line, Monty Norman's Bond theme plays [...] "and creates an indelible link between music and character." [...] In the short scene introducing Bond, there are portrayed [...] "qualities of strength, action, reaction, violence – and this elegant, slightly brutal gambler with the quizzical sneer we see before us who answers a woman when he's good and ready." [...] Raymond Benson, author of the continuation Bond novels, has stated that as the music fades up on the scene, [...] "we have ourselves a piece of classic cinema".|$|E

Bale {{said he was}} confident in his choice to return in the role because of the positive response to his portrayal in Batman Begins. He continued training in the Keysi Fighting Method and performed many of his own stunts, but did not gain as much muscle {{as in the previous}} film because the new Batsuit allowed him to move with greater agility. Bale described Batman's dilemma as whether [...] " [...] something that has an end. Can he quit and have an ordinary life? The kind of manic intensity someone has to have to maintain the passion and the anger that they felt as a child, takes an effort after a while, to keep doing that. At some point, you have to exorcise your demons." [...] He added, [...] "Now you have not just a young man in pain attempting to find some kind <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer,</b> you have somebody who actually has power, who is burdened by that power, and is having to recognize the difference between attaining that power and holding on to it." [...] Bale felt Batman's personality had been strongly established in the first film, so it was unlikely his character would be overshadowed by the villains, stating: [...] "I have no problem with competing with someone else. And that's going to make a better movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a {{production}} memo before the third season, Roddenberry credited Nimoy and the show's writers for developing Spock into a [...] "fully dimensional" [...] character. Roddenberry said Spock {{is difficult to}} write properly, and encouraged the writers to revisit some of the character's more colorful aspects, such as his music-playing and ongoing chess game with Kirk. He also said fans' most frequent request was for more confrontation between McCoy and Spock. With a move to an unfavourable timeslot for the , Roddenberry decided to step back as show runner. NBC brought in Fred Freiberger, {{who did not have}} any history with the series. At a meeting with Roddenberry, Shatner and Nimoy, Freiberger openly asked Roddenberry whether it was Kirk or Spock who was meant to be the main character. With both actors looking on in anticipation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer,</b> Roddenberry refused to give a response at first. He then stormed out the room, yelling [...] "It's Bill.

2500|$|It is {{apparent}} {{from the text}} of the subpoena itself that the prosecutor needed respondent's assistance both to identify potential sources of information and to produce those sources.... Given the breadth of the description of the 11 categories of documents called for by the subpoena, the collection and production [...] of the materials demanded was tantamount to answering a series of interrogatories asking a witness [...] to disclose the existence and location of particular documents fitting certain broad descriptions. The assembly of literally hundreds of pages of material in response to a request for [...] "any and all documents reflecting, referring, or relating to any direct or indirect sources of money or other things of value received by or provided to" [...] an individual or members of his family during a 3-year period ... is the functional equivalent of the preparation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> to either a detailed written interrogatory or a series of oral questions at a discovery deposition. Entirely apart from the contents of the 13,120 pages of materials that respondent produced in this case, it is undeniable that providing a catalog of existing documents fitting within any of the 11 broadly worded subpoena categories could provide a prosecutor with a [...] "lead to incriminating evidence," [...] or [...] "a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute." ...|$|E

This is not a game at all, and it hardly can be called a sport... get nothing out of it except a primitive form of mental exercise, and success or failure in any given attempt is equally irrelevant to mental development." [...] A clergyman called the working of crossword puzzles [...] "the mark of a childish mentality" [...] and said, [...] "There is no use for persons to pretend that working one of the puzzles carries any intellectual value with it.". However, another wrote a complete [...] "Bible Cross-Word Puzzle Book". Also in 1925, Time Magazine noted that nine Manhattan dailies and fourteen other big newspapers were carrying crosswords, and quoted opposing views as to whether [...] "This crossword craze will positively end by June!" [...] or [...] "The crossword puzzle is here to stay!" [...] In 1925, The New York Times noted, with approval, a scathing critique of crosswords by The New Republic; but concluded that [...] "Fortunately, {{the question of whether the}} puzzles are beneficial or harmful is in no urgent need <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer.</b> The craze evidently is dying out fast and in a few months it will be forgotten." [...] and in 1929 declared, [...] "The cross-word puzzle, it seems, has gone the way of all fads...." [...] In 1930, a correspondent noted that [...] "Together with The Times of London, yours is the only journal of prominence that has never succumbed to the lure of the cross-word puzzle" [...] and said that [...] "The craze—the fad—stage has passed, but there are still people numbering it to the millions who look for their daily cross-word puzzle as regularly as for the weather predictions." [...] The New York Times, however, was not to publish a crossword puzzle until 1942; today, the Times puzzle is one of the most popular in the country.|$|E
