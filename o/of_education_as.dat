5|$|Changes in {{government}} approaches towards education {{meant that it}} was no longer regarded adequate for a child to leave education aged 14, as that is the age when they were seen to really understand and appreciate the value <b>of</b> <b>education,</b> <b>as</b> well as being the period when adolescence was at its height. It was beginning to be seen as the worst age for a sudden switch from education to employment, with around 80% of children in 1938 leaving education at this age, many having only had primary-school level education. Although there were concerns about the effects of having less labour from these children, it was hoped that the outcome of a larger quantity of more qualified, skilled workers would eliminate the deficit problem from the loss of unskilled labour.|$|E
5|$|Heliade {{progressively}} distanced {{himself from}} the more radical groups, especially after discussions began {{on the issue of}} land reform and the disestablishment of the boyar class. Initially, he accepted the reforms, and, after the matter was debated within Frăţia just before rebellion broke out, he issued a resolution acknowledging this (the document was probably inspired by Nicolae Bălcescu). The compromise also set other goals, including national independence, responsible government, civil rights and equality, universal taxation, a larger Assembly, five-year terms of office for Princes (and their election by the National Assembly), freedom of the press, and decentralization. On June 21, 1848, present in Islaz alongside Tell and the Orthodox priest known as Popa Şapcă, he read out these goals to a cheering crowd, in what was to be the effective start of the uprising (see Proclamation of Islaz). Four days after the Islaz events, the revolution succeeded in toppling Bibescu, whom it replaced with a Provisional Government which immediately attracted Russian hostility. Presided over by Metropolitan Neofit, it included Heliade, who was also Minister <b>of</b> <b>Education,</b> <b>as</b> well as Tell, Ştefan Golescu, Gheorghe Magheru, and, for a short while, the Bucharest merchant Gheorghe Scurti.|$|E
5|$|In 1541 the Congregation elected Vermigli to the {{important}} post of prior of Basilica of San Frediano in Lucca. The prior at San Frediano exercised some episcopal authority {{over half the}} city, as well as control of the Lateran's religious houses. As at his earlier post in Spoleto, the monks of the San Frediano monastery {{as well as the}} clergy of Lucca were known for moral laxity, which led to an openness to the new Lutheran religion there. Vermigli saw his task as one <b>of</b> <b>education</b> <b>as</b> well as moral correction. He set up a college based on humanist principles of education and modeled on the newly founded St John's College, Cambridge, and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Instruction was in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. Among the professors were the humanists Immanuel Tremellius, Paolo Lacizi, Celio Secondo Curione, and Girolamo Zanchi, all of whom would later convert to Protestantism. The Congregation recognized Vermigli's work by appointing him to a disciplinary commission of seven canons in May 1542.|$|E

5|$|Sanjiva Reddy's birth centenary {{was celebrated}} in 2013 by the Government of Andhra Pradesh with the {{concluding}} ceremony in Anantapur being addressed by President Pranab Mukherjee {{and with the}} Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka in attendance.

In the 1960s, when he was Union Minister for Mines, a statue of him had been unveiled at Vijayawada by K Kamaraj, the then president of the Congress Party, prompting Reddy to ask for its removal as he deemed the practice of erecting statues of people holding public office undesirable. A statue of Sanjiva Reddy, unveiled in 2005, stands at the Andhra Pradesh Secretariat in Hyderabad.|$|E
5|$|In 1827, {{the church}} erected a {{building}} dedicated as a Sunday school. This {{was also used}} as a day school from 1838. In 1906, around 250 children attended the Sunday school and the church had numerous affiliated groups, such as a Penny Bank and a Choral Society. The day school accommodation {{was at that time}} condemned by the Board <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> <b>as</b> unfit for purpose and it was operating under a stay issued by the board. In the same year, Hannah Mitchell, a suffragette, was arrested at the day school for protesting during an election campaign speech by Winston Churchill. The building was closed in 1908 and a new school building opened on Gartside Street in 1910 at a cost of £4000. This new facility was used only as Sunday school because, said the local clergy, the Board of Education put too many administrative obstacles and demands in their way, such as stipulating such a small attendance roll as to render any day school uneconomic and insisting on a dedicated playground despite there being a large open space next door that was traditionally used for that purpose. According to the foundation stone of the new school building, the church had operated the first Sunday school in Manchester, although Shaw attributes that distinction to a Mr Fildes, a Methodist whose establishment began operating from a Travis Street cellar in 1782. Shaw says that several other schools preceded that of St John's.|$|E
