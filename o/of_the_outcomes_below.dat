40|$|A major {{characteristic}} of financial markets is information asymmetry. To combat its problems principals can use screening. That is, they can offer the clients {{a menu of}} contracts and infer their risk level from their choices. If <b>the</b> pattern <b>of</b> choices that clients with different risk level make differs, there is self-selection of clients and screening occurs. We conduct an experiment to address an important question for such settings?does <b>the</b> framing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> offered menu <b>of</b> contracts interfere with <b>the</b> self-selection <b>of</b> clients? <b>The</b> answer is yes. In fact, subjects? choices shift when <b>the</b> same (positive) <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same menu <b>of</b> contracts are presented in two different frames. Since both frames differ in the ?perceived? reference-point, we propose a theoretical approach that initially follows Prospect Theory to explain our results. Subjects exhibit loss aversion in their perception and assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> positive <b>outcomes</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> reference-point, and self-selection fails to occur.

40|$|Roy's [Roy, A., 1952. Safety {{first and}} <b>the</b> holding <b>of</b> assets.

We find that safety first plays {{a crucial role}} in decision-making, inducing choices that cannot be explained by, and even contradict, risk-aversion, Prospect Theory, and loss-aversion in general. Yet, safety first alone cannot explain individual choice. Therefore, we propose an expected utility - safety first (EU-SF) model where decisions are made based on a weighted average <b>of</b> <b>the</b> safety first criterion and standard expected utility maximization.

40|$|Although {{sternotomy}} {{represents the}} main surgical access for most cardiac interventions, {{there are some}} cases in which alternative surgical approaches may be safer. A re-sternotomy may determine, in patients affected by posterior or very lateral pericardial effusion or mass and in redo-surgery procedures, {{an increased risk of}} injury to cardiac structures or previously placed bypass grafts. Moreover concern can arise about sternal wound dehis-cences, late recovery from ICU, nosocomial pneumonia and prolonged hospital stay. A different surgical ap-proach should be taken into account, whenever feasible, in order to reduce those risks and improve <b>the</b> <b>outcomes.</b> <b>Below</b> are reported three successful surgical treatments of hemodynamically compromising pericardial effusion occurred as a late complication of cardiac surgery through a lateral pericardial window via a left mini-thoracotomy.

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that all {{calculations}} were done for both Cmax and also AUC values, but in order to save spaces only explanations related to Cmax will be given. It is aimed to obtain a split point which shows possible relationships between Cmax values and adverse event exist/not-exist knowledge. In <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> this study, it is important to obtain a split point denoted v that divides dataset into homogenous subsets according to knowledge of “there is adverse effect” and “there is no adverse effect”. Once v is found, it is assumed that dataset is split into two homogenous, i.e. pure classes based on adverse event (exists/not exists) such that values lower than v (Cmax ≤ v) or values higher than v (Cmax > v). In order to find v, Gini Index method was preferred, and used with Cmax values of 1992 subjects from 63 BE studies by combining their test and reference values. Gini Index is generally used with decision trees to calculate <b>the</b> impurity degrees <b>of</b> splitting (Hastie et al. 2001). Briefly, the method Gini Index would be used to find out a split point for any data to discriminate <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>below</b> and above this split points in terms <b>of</b> homogeneity.

If analgesia post-delivery is reported, we shall describe this separately. We shall undertake secondary analyses of drug concentrations and volumes, see Types of interventions.

30|$|It is {{important}} to bear in mind, however, that the quantile regressions (conditional or unconditional) do not tell us anything about <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> a policy/treatment on individuals (or households). In fact, they only inform us as to whether <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treatment is different at distinct points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> variable distribution. In other words, if <b>the</b> coefficient <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first decile is higher than <b>the</b> coefficient <b>of</b> <b>the</b> top decile, {{this does not mean}} that individuals in the first decile were more affected by the treatment. That coefficient merely tells us that the effect is higher at <b>the</b> lower tail <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> variable distribution. However, by assuming that the intervention does not change the households’ ordering in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> variable distribution, then one can argue that the impact is higher amongst the individuals in <b>the</b> lower tail <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> variable distribution. This assumption is known as rank-invariance or rank-preserving.|$|R
