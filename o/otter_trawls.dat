The only <b>otter</b> <b>trawl</b> fishing tactic targeting deep-sea species was that working in the VI ICES Division and targeting Alepocephalus baiirdi.

The longline fleet carried out 7 fishing tactics targeting deep-sea species (Molva spp.; deep water sharks; P. blennoides; Pagellus bogaraveo; and Trichiuridae) and 2 fishing tactics targeting Conger conger, which perform as deep-sea fishing tactics in the narrow continental shelf area. This classification, together with knowledge regarding their seasonal performance and spatial distribution, may help to design fisheries sampling protocols and to improve the management of these fleets, thus reducing their impact on deep-sea habitats...|$|R

Captured individuals are unlikely to survive as they are brought up from such great depths, and furthermore stingarees have a tendency to abort their young when captured. However, the SESSF only operates over part of the Great Australian Bight, and so the overall level of fishing pressure across the wide stingaree's range is low.

500|$|The crossback stingaree can inflict an excruciating injury on an unwary human {{with its}} venomous sting, that may require {{surgical}} intervention if the serrated {{tip of the}} sting breaks off inside the wound. The base of its tail is highly flexible, allowing it to strike a person touching any part of its body. In the 19th century, the hazard posed by this species led to persecution by fishery workers {{in the form of}} [...] "spiking", in which a metal spike is used to pierce the ray's cranium and remove it from the net. The IUCN has listed the crossback stingaree under Least Concern, as it is exposed to minimal fishing activity in the Bass Strait and off western Tasmania, which constitute most of its distribution. The impact of Tasmanian inshore fisheries is unquantified but unlikely to be severe. Off New South Wales, it is caught incidentally in <b>otter</b> <b>trawls</b> and gillnets used by the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF). Captured rays likely experience high mortality, and also tend to abort any unborn young. While the SESSF has caused an overall decline in deepwater stingarees within its area of operations, it only affects a small portion of this species' range.|$|E

40|$|Demands for {{management}} advice on mixed and multispecies fisheries pose many challenges, {{further complicated by}} corresponding requests for advice on {{the environmental impacts of}} alternate management options. Here, we develop, and apply to North Sea fisheries, a method for collectively assessing the effects of, and interplay between, technical interactions, multispecies interactions, and the environmental effects of fishing. Ecological interactions involving 21 species are characterized with an ensemble of 188 plausible parameterizations of size-based multispecies models, and four fleets (beam <b>trawl,</b> <b>otter</b> <b>trawl,</b> industrial, and pelagic) characterized with catch composition data. We use the method to evaluate biomass and economic yields, alongside the risk of stock depletion and changes in the value of community indicators, for 10 000 alternate fishing scenarios (combinations of rates of fishing mortality F and fleet configuration) and present the risk vs. reward trade-offs. Technical and multispecies interactions linked to the beam and <b>otter</b> <b>trawl</b> fleets were predicted to have the strongest effects on fisheries yield and value, risk of stock collapse and fish community indicators. Increasing beam trawl effort led to greater increases in beam <b>trawl</b> yield when <b>otter</b> <b>trawl</b> effort was low. If <b>otter</b> <b>trawl</b> effort was high, increases in beam trawl effort led to reduced overall yield. Given the high value of demersal species, permutations of fleet effort leading to high total yield (generated primarily by pelagic species) were not the same as permutations leading to high catch values. A transition from F for 1990 to 2010 to FMSY, but without changes in fleet configuration, reduced risk of stock collapse without affecting long-term weight or value of yield. Our approach directly addresses the need for assessment methods that treat mixed and multispecies issues collectively, address uncertainty, and take account of trade-offs between weight and value of yield, state of stocks and state of the environment...|$|R

The fishery for T. curvirostris is carried out with <b>otter</b> <b>trawls,</b> gill nets and as an artisanal fishery.

50|$|Between the 1960s and {{the early}} 2000s {{population}}s of cod and haddock have dropped by 95 - 99%. A population is termed 'collapsed' {{if there is a}} decline of over 90% from the peak catch. This collapse of commercial populations in the Clyde is often compared to the similar collapse of cod fishing in Newfoundland in the 1990s due to intense overfishing. Today there is now no viable fishery of those species. Instead invertebrate species are targeted, such as the Norway lobster and scallops (Pecten maximus). For this usually <b>otter</b> <b>trawls</b> and dredges are used, which are dragged along the seabed to disturb bottom-dwelling fish, a practice which damages seabed habitats.|$|E
50|$|Almost {{the entire}} range of the yellowback stingaree is under {{pressure}} from Australian Commonwealth and State-managed commercial fisheries.

From 1966-67 to 1996-97, the capture rate of stingarees in trawl surveys on the New South Wales upper slope, including the yellowback stingaree, declined by some 65%. Trawl surveys off Sydney found a similar decline of 45%. These negative trends and this species' restricted distribution has led it to be assessed as Vulnerable by the World Conservation Union.|$|E

50|$|The Mincarlo was {{the type}} of trawler known as a sidewinder or side trawler.

This keeps the mouth of the net open. The nets were attached to heavy duty ground ropes, 40 ft long, which held the nets on the seabed and ticked up any fish lying on or below the sand.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} work, an attempt {{is made to}} {{evaluate}} and compare the diversity of invertebrate discards from small (gill/trammel nets) and medium (<b>otter</b> <b>trawling)</b> scale fisheries in Thermaikos Gulf (North Aegean Sea), which is a major fishing area of the eastern Mediterranean but still unexplored for its benthic community structure. Sampling was performed under normal fishing activities in 21 <b>otter</b> <b>trawl</b> hauls and 62 set nets operations. One hundred thirty-two invertebrate species were altogether discarded in medium and small scale fishery over the study area, classified in 16 classes and 7 phyla. Small scale fisheries yielded almost 70 % of the total invertebrate diversity, while <b>otter</b> <b>trawling</b> only 50 %. Molluscs were the most diverse group in both fisheries followed by crustaceans and echinoderms. Multivariate analysis revealed a clear differentiation in discard species composition between the two fisheries reflecting different benthic habitats. According to the species composition of the discards certain benthic biocoenoses were identified. The Coastal terrigenous muds biocoenosis prevailed in medium scale fishing areas, accompanied by the Coastal detritic, Muddy detritic, and Bathyal mud biocoenoses. Several plant-dominated communities (mostly those of Infralittoral photophilus algae, Circalittoral sciaphilus algae, and Posidonia meadows), were recognized through small scale fishery discards. The higher diversity of the latter was attributed to the great variety of habitats and established communities in the relevant fishing grounds. These results show that invertebrate discards could contribute background data for monitoring the complex benthic system...|$|R
