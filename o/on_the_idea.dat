5|$|Flies {{appear in}} popular culture in {{concepts}} such as fly-on-the-wall documentary-making in film and television production. The metaphoric name suggests that events are seen candidly, as a fly might see them. Flies have inspired the design of miniature flying robots. Steven Spielberg's 1993 film Jurassic Park relied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that DNA could be preserved in the stomach contents of a blood-sucking fly fossilised in amber, though the mechanism has been discounted by scientists.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Gartnait son of Áedán could be the same person as Gartnait son of Domelch, king of the Picts, whose death is reported around 601, but this rests <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of Pictish matriliny, which has been criticised. Even less certainly, {{it has been argued that}} Gartnait's successor in the Pictish king-lists, Nechtan, was his grandson, and thus Áedán's great-grandson.|$|E

Loman never matures {{enough to realize that}} being popular without any substance or skill is meaningless in the end and Miller uses Loman to make his point against the anti-intellectualists. In the end, Loman gives way to the belief that his inability to be a successful man and father is condemning.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{was shown}} footage of James Cameron's Avatar which sold him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> to shoot Resident Evil: Afterlife in digital 3D. He shot in high-definition with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 using Cameron's Fusion Camera System, or more {{specifically}} a Sony F35 camera. The crew {{spent two weeks}} in pre-production learning the 3D camera system. With a budget of about $60 million, principal photography took place for 55 days from September 29, 2009 to December. Filming in 3D added 20% to the budget. Roberts began filming his scenes on October 10, 2009. The final showdown scene was filmed for about six days. During production Jovovich accidentally shot out a $100,000 camera.|$|E

The fish, nicknamed Blinky by the media, makes headlines around the state, and incumbent governor Mary Bailey calls in a government inspection team to investigate nuclear waste coming from the plant that could have caused the fish to mutate. After the inspection, the plant's owner, Mr. Burns, is presented {{with a list of}} 342 violations, which would cost $56 million to rectify. Distraught, Mr. Burns talks to plant employee Homer, who half-heartedly suggests Mr. Burns run for governor against Bailey so that he could change the standards and prevent the plant from being shut down. Mr. Burns instantly pounces <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cretton was {{inspired}} to write Short Term 12 based on his own experience of working in a group facility for teenagers.

While Larson and John Gallagher, Jr. won their roles after auditioning through Skype, {{most of the children}} featured in the film were cast through open casting calls.

5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of escaping from life {{when it becomes}} too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing {{a picture of a}} grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl {{in the way that they}} relate to their grandparents.|$|E

5|$|Doomsday is a 2008 {{science fiction}} action horror film written and {{directed}} by Neil Marshall. The film takes place in the future in Scotland, which has been quarantined because of a deadly virus. When the virus is found in London, political leaders send a team led by Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) to Scotland to find a possible cure. Sinclair's team runs into two types of survivors: marauders and medieval knights. Doomsday was conceived by Marshall based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of futuristic soldiers facing medieval knights. In producing the film, he drew inspiration from various movies, including Mad Max, Escape from New York and 28 Days Later.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} break, Jack's girlfriend CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) {{moved in with}} him. Avery decides to redecorate Jack's apartment. He is not keen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea,</b> but not wanting to say no or give into Avery's demands, decides to employ the Fabian strategy—named after Fabius Maximus, a Roman general who {{employed}} a strategy of avoiding battles, instead wearing the enemy down by attrition. Jack is successful in avoiding redecorating the apartment; he agrees to knock down a wall instead. At {{the end of the}} episode, however, he realizes that Avery has emulated the military genius of Hannibal, outmaneuvering his Fabian strategy, and he ecstatically realizes they are a perfect match, far beyond the level of mere soul-mates.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{examines}} {{the question of}} whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to violence and pornography, contending that youth are not endangered by sexually explicit material. She believes that censorship of such material from adolescents is based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that minors are innocent and exposure to inappropriate media would corrupt them, explaining how this belief {{has been used as a}} basis for censorship. Heins explores whether the government or parents should restrict children's access to potentially inappropriate material, believing that the decision should rest primarily with parents. She writes that there is no simple tactic by which government can censor material from children without violating First-Amendment rights guaranteed to adults. Heins warns that attempting to categorize forms of creative expression in order to prohibit particular works of art results in censorship choices which reflect an ideological point-of-view.|$|E

In his History of the Crusades Sa'id Ashur emphasised the similarity between the modern and medieval situation facing Muslims {{and the need to}} study the Crusades in depth. Sayyid Qutb declared there was an international Crusader conspiracy. The ideas of Jihad and a long struggle have developed some currency.|$|E
5|$|In 1092, {{the peace}} {{began to break}} down. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that the Scots {{controlled}} much of modern Cumbria, it had been supposed that William Rufus's new castle at Carlisle and his settlement of English peasants in the surrounds was the cause. It is unlikely that Malcolm controlled Cumbria, and the dispute instead concerned the estates granted to Malcolm by William Rufus's father in 1072 for his maintenance when visiting England. Malcolm sent messengers to discuss the question and William Rufus agreed to a meeting. Malcolm travelled south to Gloucester, stopping at Wilton Abbey to visit his daughter Edith and sister-in-law Cristina. Malcolm arrived there on 24 August 1093 to find that William Rufus refused to negotiate, insisting that the dispute {{be judged by the}} English barons. This Malcolm refused to accept, and returned immediately to Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Madonna trained {{physically}} doing aerobics, jogging and weight-lifting, to {{cope with}} the choreography and the dance routines. For the costumes, she collaborated with designer Marlene Stewart, expanding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of bringing her popular video characters to life onstage, reworking scenes from her music videos. The stage had four video screens, multimedia projectors and a flight of stairs in the middle. Patrick Leonard, who was the music director, encouraged Madonna to go with the idea of remixing and presenting her older songs for the show. The title Who's That Girl came to Madonna's mind when during rehearsals one-day when she looked at a gigantic image of herself, projected on a screen on the stage.|$|E
5|$|Nonviolent Communication {{is based}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that {{all human beings}} have the {{capacity}} for compassion and only resort to violence or behavior that harms others {{when they do not}} recognize more effective strategies for meeting needs. Habits of thinking and speaking that lead to the use of violence (psychological and physical) are learned through culture. NVC theory supposes all human behavior stems from attempts to meet universal human needs and that these needs are never in conflict. Rather, conflict arises when strategies for meeting needs clash. NVC proposes that if people can identify their needs, the needs of others, and the feelings that surround these needs, harmony can be achieved.|$|E
5|$|Royal Flush {{was planned}} in April 1944 by Ronald Wingate, deputy {{controller}} of the LCS.

Having seen the implementation of Operation Graffham, and with the deceptions aimed at Scandinavia and the Mediterranean, he chose Sweden, Turkey and Spain as the targets. For Sweden this was the continuation of Graffham, with demands from the US, UK and Russia that the Germans be denied access to the country following an Allied invasion of Norway. In the case of Turkey this was built on existing pressure, applied from {{the outset of the}} war, to join the Allied nations.|$|E
