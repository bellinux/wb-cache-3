5|$|However, Alexios's {{problems}} were only just beginning. At {{a time when}} the Emperor urgently needed to raise as much revenue as possible from his shattered empire, taxation and the economy were in complete disarray. Inflation was spiralling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> the coinage was heavily debased, the fiscal system was confused (there were six different nomismata in circulation), and the imperial treasury was empty.

On a blocking configuration, air traveling from the charge air supply to the wastegate actuator is blocked while simultaneously bleeding any pressure that has previously built up at the wastegate actuator.|$|R

5|$|Like many burgeoning {{cities of}} its day, Pittsburgh's growth outstripped {{some of its}} {{necessary}} infrastructure, such as a water supply with dependable pressure.

As the city rebuilt, the age of rails arrived. In 1851, the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Cleveland and Allegheny City (present-day North Side).
