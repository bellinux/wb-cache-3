5|$|About 1.22million years ago, the San Joaquin Hills {{along the}} Orange County coast began their uplift along a blind thrust fault (the San Joaquin Hills blind thrust) {{extending}} south from the Los Angeles Basin. As Aliso Creek was an antecedent stream, <b>or</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> had formed {{prior to the}} mountains' uplift, it cut a water gap through the rising mountains that today is Aliso Canyon. The same phenomenon occurred to the north with Laguna Canyon and San Diego Creek, and to the south at San Juan Creek. The uplift also caused Aliso Creek's largest tributary, Sulphur Creek, to turn north to join Aliso Creek instead of flowing south to Salt Creek. The Wisconsinian era was responsible for shaping the watershed to its present-day form, with deep side canyons and broad alluvial valleys.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{authority}} {{to the effect that}} a court will not generally grant a declaration if it considers the issue at hand to be an academic question <b>or</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> is entirely hypothetical. For instance, in Vince v. Chief Constable of Dorset Police (1992), proceedings against the Chief Constable of Dorset Police were brought by the plaintiffs on behalf of members of the Police Federation of England and Wales to, among other things, enable chief constables throughout the country to know where they stood on a question of law with respect to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, namely, whether it was unlawful to appoint an acting sergeant as a custody officer under section 36(3) of the Act. Affirming the decision of the judge below, a majority of the Court of Appeal declined to make a declaration on the matter. It took the view that since {{there was no evidence that}} any chief constable had ever appointed an acting sergeant as a custody officer, the issue was academic or hypothetical.|$|E

25|$|The eyes of most labyrinthodonts were {{situated}} {{at the top of}} the skull, offering good vision upwards, but very little lateral vision. The parietal eye was prominent, although there is uncertainty as to whether it was a true image producing organ <b>or</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> could only register light and dark, like that of the modern tuatara.|$|E

25|$|A {{shot that}} misses both {{the rim and}} the {{backboard}} completely {{is referred to as}} an air ball. A particularly bad shot, <b>or</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> only hits the backboard, is jocularly called a brick. The hang time is the length of time a player stays in the air after jumping, either to make a slam dunk, lay-up or jump shot.|$|E
25|$|There are {{numerous}} hazards that might cause {{a need to}} halt or prematurely end a session. Many hazards, such as rain, darkness, a blocked course (due to debris, water, or safety vehicles), a car on fire, or a multi-car crash (especially one that results in serious injuries <b>or</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> results in damage to walls, fences or the surface itself which require repairs) might prompt series officials to call for the red flag.|$|E
25|$|Collecting is {{for some}} people a {{childhood}} hobby, but for others a lifelong pursuit <b>or</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> begins in adulthood. Collectors who begin early in life often modify their aims when they get older. Some novice collectors start purchasing items that appeal to them then slowly work at learning {{how to build a}} collection, while others prefer to develop some background in the field before starting to buy items. The emergence of the internet as a global forum for different collectors has resulted in many isolated enthusiasts finding each other.|$|E

25|$|Historical records {{offer little}} {{insight into what}} type of habitat was {{preferred}} by the American burying beetle. Current information suggests that this species is a habitat generalist, <b>or</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> lives in many types of habitat, with a slight preference for grasslands and open understory oak hickory forests. However, the beetles are carrion specialists in that they need carrion {{the size of a}} dove or a chipmunk in order to reproduce. Carrion availability may be the greatest factor determining where the species can survive.|$|E
25|$|While {{the first}} {{derivative}} test identifies points {{that might be}} extrema, this test does not distinguish a point that is a minimum from one that is a maximum <b>or</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> is neither. When the objective function is twice differentiable, these cases can be distinguished by checking the second derivative or the matrix of second derivatives (called the Hessian matrix) in unconstrained problems, or the matrix of second derivatives of the objective function and the constraints called the bordered Hessian in constrained problems. The conditions that distinguish maxima, or minima, from other stationary points are called 'second-order conditions' (see 'Second derivative test'). If a candidate solution satisfies the first-order conditions, then satisfaction of the second-order conditions as well is sufficient to establish at least local optimality.|$|E
25|$|In {{evaluating}} {{these signs}} and symptoms, one {{must consider the}} frequency of repetition, {{whether or not the}} movements can be suppressed voluntarily (either by cognitive decisions, restraint, or sensory tricks), the awareness of the affected individual during the movement events, any urges to make the movements, and if the affected individual feels rewarded after having completed the movement. The context of the movement should also be noted; this means that a movement could be triggered in a certain posture, while at rest, during action, or during a specific task. The movement’s quality can also be described in observing whether or not the movement can be categorized as a normal movement by an unaffected individual, <b>or</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> is not normally made on a daily basis by unaffected individuals.|$|E

25|$|A {{block is}} {{performed}} when, after a shot is attempted, a defender succeeds in altering the shot by touching the ball. In almost all variants of play, {{it is illegal}} to touch the ball after it is in the downward path of its arc; this is known as goaltending. It is also illegal under NBA and Men's NCAA basketball to block a shot after it has touched the backboard, or when any part of the ball is directly above the rim. Under international rules {{it is illegal to}} block a shot that is in the downward path of its arc <b>or</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> has touched the backboard until the ball has hit the rim. After the ball hits the rim, it is again legal to touch it even though it is no longer considered as a block performed.|$|E
25|$|Relative dating {{techniques}} (based on {{a presumption}} that technology progresses over time) suggest that Acheulean tools followed on from earlier, cruder tool-making methods, {{but there is}} considerable chronological overlap in early prehistoric stone-working industries, with evidence in some regions that Acheulean tool-using groups were contemporary with other, less sophisticated industries such as the Clactonian and then later with the more sophisticated Mousterian, as well. It is therefore important not to see the Acheulean as a neatly defined period <b>or</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> happened {{as part of a}} clear sequence but as one tool-making technique that flourished especially well in early prehistory. The enormous geographic spread of Acheulean techniques also makes the name unwieldy as it represents numerous regional variations on a similar theme. The term Acheulean does not represent a common culture in the modern sense, rather it is a basic method for making stone tools that was shared across much of the Old World.|$|E

500|$|The modern {{name for}} the hill fort is first {{recorded}} in 1607 as Mayden Castell; it {{is not unique to}} the site and occurs in several other places in Britain and is widely taken to mean a [...] "fortification that looks impregnable" [...] <b>or</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> has never been taken in battle. Alternatively, the name may derive from the Brittonic mai-dun, meaning a [...] "great hill". A more recent explanation has been advanced by Richard Coates suggesting that the name is only of medieval origin, and was applied simultaneously to the considerable number of identically named locations around the country.|$|E
