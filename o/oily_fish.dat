5|$|Fish are {{consumed}} fresh, {{or may be}} preserved by traditional methods, which include combinations of drying, smoking, and salting, or fermentation. Modern methods of preservation include freezing, freeze-drying, and heat processing (as in canning). Frozen fish products include breaded or battered fillets, fish fingers and fishcakes. Fish meal {{is used as a}} food supplement for farmed fish and for livestock. Fish oils are made either from fish liver, especially rich in vitamins A and D, or from the bodies of <b>oily</b> <b>fish</b> such as sardine and herring, and used as food supplements and to treat vitamin deficiencies.|$|E
25|$|There are {{not many}} foods that {{naturally}} have vitamin D. Examples are cod liver oil and <b>oily</b> <b>fish.</b> If people cannot get sunlight, then they will need 1,000 IU of vitamin D per day to stay healthy. A person would have to eat <b>oily</b> <b>fish</b> {{three or four times}} per week in order to get enough vitamin D from that food source alone.|$|E
25|$|Typical ocean {{forage fish}} are small, silvery {{schooling}} <b>oily</b> <b>fish</b> such as herring, anchovies and menhaden, and other small, schooling baitfish like capelin, smelts, sand lance, halfbeaks, pollock, butterfish and juvenile rockfish. Herrings are a preeminent forage fish, often marketed as sardines or pilchards.|$|E

25|$|Salmon is {{a popular}} food. Classified as an <b>oily</b> <b>fish,</b> salmon is {{considered}} to be healthy due to the fish's high protein, high omega-3 fatty acids, and high vitamin D content. Salmon is also a source of cholesterol, with a range of 23–214mg/100g depending on the species. According to reports in the journal Science, farmed salmon may contain high levels of dioxins. PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) levels may be up to eight times higher in farmed salmon than in wild salmon, but still well below levels considered dangerous. Nonetheless, according to a 2006 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the benefits of eating even farmed salmon still outweigh any risks imposed by contaminants. Farmed salmon has a high omega 3 fatty acid content comparable to wild salmon. The type of omega-3 present may not be a factor for other important health functions.|$|E
50|$|Sunlight, {{especially}} ultraviolet light, lets {{human skin}} cells convert vitamin D from an inactive to active state. In {{the absence of}} vitamin D, dietary calcium is not properly absorbed, resulting in hypocalcaemia, leading to skeletal and dental deformities and neuromuscular symptoms, e.g. hyperexcitability. Foods that contain vitamin D include butter, eggs, fish liver oils, margarine, fortified milk and juice, portabella and shiitake mushrooms, and <b>oily</b> <b>fishes</b> such as tuna, herring, and salmon. A rare X-linked dominant form exists called vitamin D-resistant rickets or X-linked hypophosphatemia.|$|R

Formed products were treated with ethanol and normal hexane then dried. Chromatographic behavior, lipids content, total protein content, protein digestibility, solubility, hydration capacity, thiobarbituric number and aminoacid content of dried products were studied. Sephadex chromatography of end products and hydrolyzed solution showed only a slight change in molecular weight distribution. Dried products had high protein content, low lipid content (about 0. 3 - 0. 5 %), nice protein digestibility (75 %), low thiobarbituric number and high proportion content of essential amino acids. Protein recovery was 67. 5 % for water soluble protein and 28 % for waste protein. It was possible to get gel like products...|$|R

25|$|Many {{types of}} gear {{have been used}} to catch blue crabs along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Initially people used very simple {{techniques}} and gear, which included hand lines, dip nets, and push nets among a variety of other gear types. The trotline, a long baited twine set in waters 5–15 feet deep, was the first major gear type used commercially to target hard crabs. Use of commercial trotlines is now mostly limited to the tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. In the Gulf of Mexico, trotline use drastically declined after invention of the crab pot in 1938. Crab pots are rigid boxlike traps made of hexagonal or square wire mesh. They possess between two and four funnels that extend into the trap, with the smaller end of the funnel inside of the trap. A central compartment made of smaller wire mesh holds bait. Crabs attracted by odorant plumes from the bait, often an <b>oily</b> <b>fish,</b> enter the trap through the funnels and cannot escape.|$|E
25|$|Plant-based, or vegetarian, {{sources of}} Omega 3 fatty acids include soy, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, canola oil, kiwifruit, hempseed, algae, chia seed, flaxseed, echium seed and leafy {{vegetables}} such as lettuce, spinach, cabbage and purslane. Purslane contains more Omega 3 {{than any other}} known leafy green. Olives (and olive oil) are another important plant source of unsaturated fatty acids. Plant foods can provide alpha-linolenic acid which the human body uses to synthesize the long-chain n-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. EPA and DHA can be obtained directly in high amounts from <b>oily</b> <b>fish</b> or fish oils. Vegetarians, and particularly vegans, have lower levels of EPA and DHA than meat-eaters. While {{the health effects of}} low levels of EPA and DHA are unknown, it is unlikely that supplementation with alpha-linolenic acid will significantly increase levels. Recently, some companies have begun to market vegetarian DHA supplements containing seaweed extracts. Similar supplements providing both DHA and EPA have also begun to appear. Whole seaweeds are not suitable for supplementation because their high iodine content limits the amount that may be safely consumed. However, certain algae such as spirulina are good sources of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), linoleic acid (LA), stearidonic acid (SDA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid (AA).|$|E

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of larval Anisakidae and Raphidascarididae in anchovies and sardines from the North Adriatic Sea has been estimated. Anisakis pegreffii and Hysterothylacium aduncum were reported, with low prevalence values. In brief, a {{total amount of}} 7650 fish specimens collected between September 2011 and 2012 were analysed using three different inspection analyses: a visual inspection of the coelomic cavity, {{an examination of the}} viscera exploiting the positive hydro-tropism of the larvae (modified Baermann technique) and enzymatic digestion of muscular tissue pools. Low level of infestation was reported for Anisakis sp. in both in anchovies and sardines, while higher values were reported for Hysterothylacium sp. Subsamples of nematodes collected were characterized at species level using the molecular diagnostic key based on ITS nuclear ribosomal region, and A. pegreffii and H. aduncum were identified. The low prevalence of Anisakis sp. in sardines and anchovies from the North Adriatic Sea could be related to the peculiar distribution of cetaceans and carnivorous zooplankton in the investigated region and {{could be used as a}} potential tag to define <b>oily</b> <b>fishes</b> from this specific fishing area as at low-risk for anisakiasis...|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} the seafood consumption worldwide {{as well as}} the related nutritional–toxicological conflict. An exposure assessment was performed using seafood consumption data from the Global Environment Monitoring System and nutrient and contaminant concentration data. The data indicated that the region of Japan, Korea, Madagascar and Philippines have the highest seafood consumption, followed by the Nordic–Baltic countries and South-East Asia. In Japan, Korea, Madagascar, Philippines and the Nordic–Baltic countries, pelagic marine fishes are highly consumed compared to fresh water fishes in South-East Asia. Because pelagic <b>fishes</b> are <b>oily</b> <b>fishes,</b> Japan, Korea, Madagascar, Philippines and the Nordic–Baltic countries have high omega- 3 fatty acids and vitamin D intake. Iodine intake is influenced by the demersal fish consumption. The current intake of these nutrients via seafood consumption is still below the recommendations. From the toxicological side, the data indicate that none of the seafood groups had a median contaminant concentration above the EU maximum limits. Though, the results show that in some regions the contaminant intake exceeded the international health-based guidance values, mainly focussing on sensitive subpopulations. In contrast, when using less stringent guidance values relevant for non-sensitive subpopulations, the results show that the benefits of increased seafood consumption outweigh the risks...|$|R

This study did not, however, present new data as levels of contaminants were consistent with those previously reported in smaller studies and remained within internationally accepted safety guidelines. The discrepancy arose because the authors based their advice on a method of risk analysis that is not internationally accepted by toxicologists and other food safety experts. Food safety authorities in Europe and in the USA agreed that the study did not raise new health concerns and that eating one portion of farmed salmon per week was still considered safe." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{event was}} originally {{a tribute to}} the start of the fishing season. The planking dates to the 1930s near Smithfield, Virginia, beginning as a small gathering of friends to celebrate the James River running of shad—the <b>oily,</b> bony <b>fish</b> smoked for the occasion on wood planks over an open flame. The unique shad cooking technique that is enjoyed today traces its roots to Mr. Paul Cox, of Surry County, Virginia. Mr. Cox, along with several Ruritans including Dr. E.C. Nettles and Mr. Richard Savedge, invited twenty-five of their friends to historic Wrenn's Mill in Isle of Wight County, Virginia for their first Shad Planking. Having attended similar functions in the deep South, Mr. Cox introduced the group to the intriguing process of cooking 15 shad they had caught earlier in the day from the James River on hardwood planks over an open fire.|$|R

40|$|The slow {{recovery}} of the “northern”Atlantic cod (Gadusmorhua) stockoffNewfoundland and Labrador has been ascribed tomany factors. One hypothesis is poor feeding and condition {{as a consequence of}} a decline in capelin (Mallotus villosus), their former main prey. We com-pared the growth and condition of cod from known inshore (Smith Sound) and offshore (Bonavista Corridor) centres of rebuilding in wild subjects versus captive subjects fed an unlimited diet of <b>oily</b> rich <b>fish.</b> Wild fish in these areas have had different diets and population per-formance trends since stock declines in the early 1990 s. Captive cod fromboth areas grew at the same rates and achieved equivalent prime condition, while their wild counterparts differed, with smaller sizes, lower condition in small fish, and elevated mortality levels in the off-shore centre. Environmental temperature conditions did not account for the differences in performance of wild fish. Our results suggest that fish growth and condition, and hence rebuilding in the formerly large offshore spawning components of the northern cod, have been limited by a lack of capelin in their diet. Furthermore, we suggest that these groups are unlikely to rebuild until a recovery in capelin occurs...|$|R
