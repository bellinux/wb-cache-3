5|$|In later years, {{numerous}} {{proposals were}} put forward to salvage Titanic. However, all fell afoul of practical and technological difficulties, {{a lack of}} funding and, in many cases, a lack <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> physical conditions at the wreck site. Charles Smith, an architect from Denver, proposed in March 1914 to attach electromagnets to a submarine which would be irresistibly drawn to the wreck's steel hull. Having found its exact position, more electromagnets would be sent down from a fleet of barges which would winch Titanic to the surface. An estimated cost of $1.5 million (£ today) and its impracticality meant that the idea was not put into practice. Another proposal involved raising Titanic by means of attaching balloons to her hull using electromagnets. Once enough balloons had been attached, the ship would float gently to the surface. Again, the idea got {{no further than the}} drawing board.|$|E

Marge immediately drives to North Haverbrook, which Lanley mentioned was a previous purchaser {{of one of his}} monorails. She discovers that the town is in ruins. While exploring, Marge meets Sebastian Cobb, the engineer who designed Lanley's North Haverbrook monorail. Cobb explains that Lanley embezzled construction funds through shoddy workmanship and materials, and that the entire project was a scam. Realizing Marge believes him, he offers his assistance in helping to prevent the same fate from happening to Springfield.|$|E

25|$|The gradual Christianization of the Bulgarian population, {{the fact}} that the service was {{initially}} practiced in Greek, which only the elite knew, resulted in a low level <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> religion among the peasantry. Due to the constant wars during the time of Simeon I, the lands near the Byzantine border (Thrace) were devastated, and the people living there were left without occupation. The constant change of authority over these lands, and the higher taxes during the time of Tsar Peter I, gave birth to a great social discontent {{at the beginning of the}} 10th century. Moreover, the corruption of the church as an institution, led to grave disappointment among its recently converted flock.|$|E

The lack <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> difference between Palestinian groups and the total ignorance of Palestinian politics on the part an overwhelming majority of Israelis and Jews played into the hands of those who did not wish to distinguish between the PLO and the Abu Nidal group.
