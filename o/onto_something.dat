Doggett is then suspended by Kersh and Follmer. Reyes tries {{to find out more about}} McMahon's history and learns that she is a Department of Justice employee and had been contacted by Wormus and McFarland in their attempts to expose the plans to contaminate the water supply. The Lone Gunmen intercept a call from the captain to Wormus, who tells him to contact the FBI, Knowle Rohrer is nearby eavesdropping. The captain then pulls a gun on the Navy Seal guarding the entrance to the lab, demanding that Nordlinger surrender the project's data. He does not notice Rohrer creeping up behind him. After hearing Reyes' findings, Scully, Reyes and Doggett go to the ship. They expect to meet the captain, but instead find Rohrer. Just as Rohrer is about to crush Doggett's skull, he is decapitated by McMahon. Rohrer is presumed dead, but soon awakens and stabs McMahon. Both bodies tumble into the water. The three agents board the ship, which is abandoned, and find the captain's decapitated body. Scully gains access to the now empty lab and finds evidence of manipulation of ova. However, she is forced to leave when Doggett finds a time bomb on the bridge. The agents narrowly escape the explosion.|$|E

500|$|Although more commercially {{successful}} than the band's previous albums, Mother's Milk received mixed reviews from critics who were unimpressed with the excessive distortion {{found throughout the}} record. However, it was praised as well; Amy Hanson of AllMusic called it [...] "a pivotal album for the Red Hot Chili Peppers," [...] and believed that [...] "if anyone doubted the pulsating power that leapt from the blistering opener, 'Good Time Boys', {{it took only a}} few bars of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' outrageous, and brilliant, interpretation of the Stevie Wonder classic 'Higher Ground' to prove that this new lineup was <b>onto</b> <b>something</b> special. Wrapping up with the aptly titled and truly punked-out 'Punk Rock Classic' and the band's own punched-up tribute to 'Magic Johnson', Mother's Milk was everything the band had hoped for, and a little more besides." [...] Steve Morse of The Boston Globe called it a [...] "high-octane fusion of metal, funk and rap—sort of Prince meets Jimi Hendrix in the Twilight Zone," [...] while noting that [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] combined [...] "electrifying musicianship". The Toronto Star commented that the Red Hot Chili Peppers were [...] "the Mothers of Invention for the 1990s."

[...] Nolan mentioned a recurring theme throughout the album: [...] "The issue of being an adult with a real life and a long-term relationship or marriage, and trying to make that work." [...] The album's sound has been described as rock. Band members made up their own sequences for the track listing, then noted the similarities. Lazzara said [...] "...with El Paso ... Why not come out swinging?" [...] The track {{was one of the first}} songs written for the album, and Lazzara said it encapsulates [...] "both the mood of the environment we were in down there and the mood we were in about being back together again and writing new music". Lazzara called it [...] "probably the heaviest rock song we've ever written". After the group finished the track, they listened to it 15 or 16 times in a row, and proceeded to exclaim: [...] "Holy shit." [...] "When everybody's like 'Holy shit' about something, you're <b>onto</b> <b>something.</b> It's a total motorcycle-raging-down-the-highway kind of song." [...] Lazzara said [...] "Faith (When I Let You Down)" [...] matches a [...] "huge, punishing" [...] chorus with a soft verse, which comes across as a [...] "roller coaster" [...] to him. Lazzara mentioned that the track took longer to work on compared to the other songs on the album, going through 4 or 5 sets of lyrics.|$|E

2500|$|Bernstein was {{appointed}} in 1973 to the Charles Eliot Norton Chair as Professor of Poetry at his alma mater, Harvard University, and delivered {{a series of}} six televised lectures on music with musical examples played by the Boston Symphony Orchestra. However, these lectures were not televised until 1976. Taking the title from a Charles Ives work, he called the series The Unanswered Question; it was a set of interdisciplinary lectures in which he borrowed terminology from contemporary linguistics to analyze and compare musical construction to language. The lectures are presently available in both book and DVD form. The DVD video was not taken directly from the lectures at Harvard, rather they were recreated again at the WGBH studios for filming. This {{appears to be the}} only surviving Norton lectures series available to the general public in video format.

2500|$|For example, the Tate Gallery's online art {{glossary}} {{states that}} collage [...] "was first {{used as an}} artists' technique in the twentieth century.". According to the Guggenheim Museum's online art glossary, collage is an artistic concept associated with the beginnings of modernism, and entails {{much more than the}} idea of gluing something <b>onto</b> <b>something</b> else. The glued-on patches which Braque and Picasso added to their canvases offered a new perspective on painting when the patches [...] "collided with the surface plane of the painting." [...] In this perspective, collage was part of a methodical reexamination of the relation between painting and sculpture, and these new works [...] "gave each medium some of the characteristics of the other," [...] according to the Guggenheim essay. Furthermore, these chopped-up bits of newspaper introduced fragments of externally referenced meaning into the collision: [...] "References to current events, such as the war in the Balkans, and to popular culture enriched the content of their art." [...] This juxtaposition of signifiers, [...] "at once serious and tongue-in-cheek," [...] was fundamental to the inspiration behind collage: [...] "Emphasizing concept and process over end product, collage has brought the incongruous into meaningful congress with the ordinary." ...|$|E

[...] Simply by luck, whenever Barnard needed a break from this work, he could wander across the hall and talk with Vince Gott who ran the lab for open-heart surgery pioneer Walt Lillehei. [...] Gott had begun to develop a technique of running blood backwards through the veins of the heart so Lillehei could more easily operate on the aortic valve (McRae writes, [...] "It {{was the type of}} inspired thinking that entranced Barnard"). [...] In March 1956, Gott asked Barnard to help him run the heart-lung machine for an operation. [...] Shortly thereafter, Wangensteen agreed to let Barnard switch to Lillehei's 's service. [...] It was during this time that Barnard first became acquainted with fellow future heart transplantation surgeon Norman Shumway. [...] Barnard also became friendly with Gil Campbell who had demonstrated that a dog's lung could be used to oxygenate blood during open-heart surgery. [...] (The year before Barnard arrived, Lillehei and Campbell had used this procedure for twenty minutes during surgery on a 13-year-old boy with ventricular septal defect, and the boy had made a full recovery.) [...] Barnard and Campbell met regularly for early breakfast. [...] In 1958, Barnard received a Master of Science in Surgery for a thesis titled [...] "The aortic valve – problems in the fabrication and testing of a prosthetic valve".

5000|$|Viewed as {{an aspect}} of speech and writing, metaphor qualifies as style, in particular, style {{characterized}} by a type of analogy.

The phrase, [...] "viewed as {{an aspect of}}", projects the properties of seeing (vision) something from a particular perspective <b>onto</b> thinking about <b>something</b> from a particular perspective, that [...] "something" [...] in this case referring to [...] "metaphor" [...] and that [...] "perspective" [...] in this case referring to the characteristics of speech and writing.|$|R
50|$|Stonekeep is a first-person RPG in {{the style}} of Eye of the Beholder and Dungeon Master. The game is set in a series of {{underground}} labyrinths, filled with monsters, treasures and traps. The player uses the directional keys on the keyboard for movement and typing in notes in the journal and uses the mouse pointer to interact with objects and characters. The mouse pointer is usually a target indicator for aiming attacks and weapons wherever it is clicked. When the mouse pointer is moved <b>onto</b> a particular <b>something</b> it changes to another icon to indicate a different action. For example, the mouse pointer changes to an eye when the player can examine things (often signs) or the mouse pointer changes into a spread-out hand when the player can pick up items. Other mouse pointers include opening and closing chests, opening and closing panels, pulling levers and switches, pressing buttons, drinking water and giving items.|$|R
