5|$|Because {{chromium}} compounds {{were used}} in dyes, paints, and leather tanning compounds, these compounds are <b>often</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> soil and groundwater at abandoned industrial sites, now needing environmental cleanup and remediation. Primer paint containing hexavalent chromium is still widely used for aerospace and automobile refinishing applications.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine-18 is <b>often</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> {{radioactive}} tracers for positron emission tomography, as its half-life of almost two hours is {{long enough to}} allow for its transport from production facilities to imaging centers. The most common tracer is fluorodeoxyglucose which, after intravenous injection, is taken up by glucose-requiring tissues such as the brain and most malignant tumors; computer-assisted tomography can then be used for detailed imaging.|$|E
5|$|Human {{activity}} has generally benefited the American goldfinch. It is <b>often</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> residential areas, attracted to bird feeders which increase its survival rate in these areas. Deforestation also creates open meadow areas which are its preferred habitat.|$|E

5|$|Manganese is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Mn and atomic number 25.

Manganese is a metal with important industrial metal alloy uses, particularly in stainless steels.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybe semilanceata fruits solitarily or {{in groups}} on rich and acidic soil, {{typically}} in grasslands, such as meadows, pastures, or lawns. It is <b>often</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> pastures {{that have been}} fertilized with sheep or cow dung, although it does not typically grow directly on the dung.|$|E
5|$|Rainforests {{are areas}} of the world with very high rainfall. Both {{tropical}} and temperate rainforests exist. Tropical rainforests occupy a large band of the planet mostly along the equator. Most temperate rainforests are located on mountainous west coasts between 45 and 55 degrees latitude, but they are <b>often</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> other areas.|$|E

5|$|Seamounts are <b>often</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> groupings or {{submerged}} archipelagos, {{a classic}} example being the Emperor Seamounts, {{an extension of the}} Hawaiian Islands. Formed millions of years ago by volcanism, they have since subsided far below sea level. This long chain of islands and seamounts extends thousands of kilometers northwest from the island of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Since 1 April 2006, the International Association of Classification Societies {{has adopted}} the Common Structural Rules. The rules apply to bulkers more than 90meters {{in length and}} require that scantlings' {{calculations}} take into account items such as the effect of corrosion, the harsh conditions <b>often</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the North Atlantic, and dynamic stresses during loading. The rules also establish margins for corrosion, from 0.5 to 0.9mm.|$|E
5|$|Suillus collinitus is <b>often</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> {{the same}} habitat with other {{thermophilic}} species, including S.mediterraneensis and S.bellinii, {{especially in the}} Mediterranean basin. Some common species which occur throughout much of Europe and also associate with two-needled pines include S.luteus and S.granulatus.|$|E
50|$|Balistraria can <b>often</b> be <b>found</b> <b>in</b> {{the curtain}} walls of medieval battlements beneath the crenellations.|$|R
50|$|Statue {{of a pair}} of lions <b>often</b> <b>founds</b> <b>in</b> temples in Southeast Asia as {{the gate}} guardian. In Borobudur Buddhist {{monument}} Central Java, Indonesia andesite stone statues of lions guarding four main entrances of Borobudur. The thrones of Buddha and Boddhisattva <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Kalasan and Mendut Buddhist temples of ancient Java depicted elephant, lion, and makara. The statue of winged lion also <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Penataran temple East Java.|$|R

5|$|The {{chemicals}} in the red-colored zone include an aromatic quinone, beta-carotene, and chlorophyll. The quinone is deep-red colored pigment chiodectonic acid, thought {{to function as a}} radiation protectant; in combination with beta-carotene, which has an established role in cellular DNA repair following exposure of the organism to UV-damage, such radiation protectants are <b>often</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> lichens and in extremophilic situations and are essential for survival.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} colour of {{the cap and}} pores make it hard {{to confuse}} with other species. <b>Often</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> similar habitats is S.variegatus, though this species has a granular cap and dark olive pores, which are smaller and not decurrent. It can also bruise blue.|$|E
5|$|The family Charadriidae {{includes}} the plovers, dotterels and lapwings. They are small- to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short, thick necks and long, usually pointed, wings. They are <b>often</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water. In Tasmania, ten {{species have been}} recorded, three of which are vagrants.|$|E
50|$|The Antarctic {{sea urchin}} is <b>often</b> <b>found</b> living <b>in</b> {{association}} with the Antarctic scallop, Adamussium colbecki and the seastar, Odontaster validus.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} widely {{distributed}} throughout Southern Europe where it cover more than 1700.000 ha. It is <b>often</b> <b>found</b> cultivated <b>in</b> coppices and orchards and more rarely <b>found</b> <b>in</b> forests stand.|$|R

5|$|The greater {{adjutant}} {{is usually}} seen singly {{or in small}} groups as it stalks about in shallow lakes or drying lake beds and garbage dumps. It is <b>often</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the company of kites and vultures and will sometimes sit hunched still for long durations. They may also hold their wings outstretched, presumably to control their temperature. They soar on thermals using their large outstretched wings.|$|E
5|$|Another risk to rat owners is Rat-bite fever. This is a {{rare disease}} among domesticated rats and is most <b>often</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> rats from large chain pet stores who breed their stock of rats in masses (usually with the {{intention}} of being snake food rather than pets) or from breeders who fail to take good care of their rats. This disease is fairly unnoticeable in the rat, but is characterized by the swelling of the site of the bite or scratch where it was contracted, a fever, vomiting and body aches. It is contracted by being bitten or scratched by an infected rat.|$|E
5|$|Copper(III) is most <b>often</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> oxides. A simple {{example is}} {{potassium}} cuprate, KCuO2, a blue-black solid. The most extensively studied copper(III) compounds are the cuprate superconductors. Yttrium barium copper oxide (YBa2Cu3O7) consists of both Cu(II) and Cu(III) centres. Like oxide, fluoride {{is a highly}} basic anion and is known to stabilize metal ions in high oxidation states. Both copper(III) and even copper(IV) fluorides are known, K3CuF6 and Cs2CuF6, respectively.|$|E
