5|$|A {{keystone}} species is {{a species that}} is connected to a disproportionately large number <b>of</b> <b>other</b> species in the food-web. Keystone species have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative {{to the importance of}} their role. The many connections that a {{keystone species}} holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction <b>of</b> <b>other</b> species.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} reliability and validity of a Cognitive and Emotional Empathy Scale for Adults (CEES-A) and the relationships between empathy and both prosocial and aggressive behavior. The participants were 469 university students. The results of factor analysis reveal six factors. Cognitive empathy consists of two factors: "sensitivity to the emotions <b>of</b> <b>others</b> (sens) " and "perspective-taking (pt) ". Emotional empathy consists of four factors: "sharing the positive emotions <b>of</b> <b>others</b> (sp) ", "sharing the negative emotions <b>of</b> <b>others</b> (sn) ", "good feelings toward the positive emotions <b>of</b> <b>others</b> (gf) " and "sympathy for the negative emotions <b>of</b> <b>others</b> (sym) ". The results of path analysis indicate that sens, sp, and sn have positive relationships with prosocial behaviors. Moreover, sp has a negative relationship with aggressive behaviors. Finally, we discuss the prospects for future research on empathy...|$|R

50|$|Those with {{schizophrenia}} {{have shown}} to be more easily disturbed by the negative emotions, which includes pain, <b>of</b> <b>others</b> compared to healthy samples in studies conducted. Schizophrenics tend to feel increased levels of personal distress when perceiving any sign <b>of</b> pain in <b>other</b> people. This tightened self-oriented negative emotion of personal distress {{has been described as}} ‘hyper sensitivity’ to the pain <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> This 'hyper sensitivity' has been suggested to overwhelm the individual and hence impair their ability to empathetically respond and relate to the pain <b>of</b> <b>others</b> on a personal level. The increased levels of personal distress may increase the individual's need to reduce their own discomfort, meaning they give less attention to and empathize less with the pain <b>of</b> <b>others.</b>|$|R
