5|$|WHEN {{on board}} HMS Beagle, as naturalist, I was much struck with certain {{facts in the}} {{distribution}} of the inhabitants of South America, and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent. These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species—that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of <b>our</b> <b>greatest</b> philosophers.|$|E
5|$|Our {{way forward}} lies in decisively turning our backs on the {{policies}} and practices that violate <b>our</b> <b>greatest</b> strength: our Constitution and the commitment it embodies {{to the rule of}} law. Liberty and security do not compete in a zero-sum game; our freedoms are the very foundation of our strength and security. The ACLU's National Security Project advocates for national security policies that are consistent with the Constitution, the rule of law, and fundamental human rights. The Project litigates cases relating to detention, torture, discrimination, surveillance, censorship, and secrecy.|$|E

25|$|Religion, Unger argues, is {{a vision}} of the world within which we anchor our {{orientation}} to life. It is within this orientation that we deal with <b>our</b> <b>greatest</b> terrors and highest hopes. Because we are doomed to die, we hope for eternal life; because we are unable to grasp to totality of existence or of the universe, we try to dispel the mystery and provide a comprehensible explanation; because we have an insatiable desire, we cry for an object that is worthy of this desire, one that is infinite. Humans initially invested religious discourse in nature and the human susceptibility to nature. But as societies evolved and people developed ways to cope with the unpredictability of nature, the emphasis of religion shifted to social existence and its defects. A new moment in religion will begin, Unger argues, when we stop telling ourselves that all will be fine and we begin to face the incorrigible flaws in human existence. The future of religion lies in embracing our mortality and our groundlessness.|$|E

500|$|Carlo D'Este {{insisted that}} Bradley disliked Patton both {{personally}} and professionally, but Bradley biographer Jim DeFelice {{noted that the}} evidence indicates otherwise. President Franklin D. Roosevelt appeared to greatly esteem Patton and his abilities, stating [...] "he is <b>our</b> <b>greatest</b> fighting general, and sheer joy". On the other hand, Roosevelt's successor, Harry S. Truman, appears to have taken an instant dislike to Patton, at one point comparing both him and Douglas MacArthur to George Armstrong Custer.|$|E
500|$|Bell {{was criticized}} for {{censoring}} TV broadcasts, a charge he dismissed as not pertinent because he believed he was not impeding the print media but only advertising a product. After CBS and NBC gained the rights to broadcast the games in 1956, he advised the franchises to avoid criticizing the games or the officials, and forewarned that TV would give [...] "'us <b>our</b> <b>greatest</b> opportunity to sell the NFL and everyone must present to the public the greatest games... combined with the finest sportsmanship.'" [...] This relationship with television {{was the beginning of}} the NFL's rise to becoming America's most popular sport.|$|E

500|$|Crawford was {{recognised}} for {{his contributions}} to bringing archaeology to a wide sector of the British public. The archaeologist Caroline Malone stated that many viewed Crawford as [...] "an 'amateur's' archaeologist, providing the means to publish and comment outside the restrictions of local journals and to offer {{a vision of a}} new and universal discipline". Clark expressed the view that Crawford [...] "always hankered to restore the flesh and blood and to make the past a reality to the living generation", and in doing so helped to attract a greater public audience for British archaeology than many of his colleagues. Wheeler remarked that [...] "he was <b>our</b> <b>greatest</b> archaeological publicist; he taught the world about scholarship, and scholars about one another".|$|E
500|$|DAAS employ an aggressive, confrontational style, which {{author and}} {{journalist}} Geoff Bartlett describes as [...] " [...] {{the boundaries of}} humour and good taste to their absolute limits". They frequently delve into topical and taboo subject matter with songs such as [...] "Commies for Christ" [...] and [...] "I Fuck Dogs". [...] "Long before anyone knew the term, one of <b>our</b> <b>greatest</b> driving forces was to be politically incorrect," [...] said Ferguson. Each band member developed distinctive onstage characters, with McDermott adopting a nasty, mean persona, while Ferguson played a narcissistic character who was [...] "gorgeous but stupid". Fidler initially played the straight man, but as the group became more aggressive he developed into a character who was naturally happy and caring but frequently victimised by his fellow band members.|$|E
