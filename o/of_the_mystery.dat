5|$|In a {{match for}} the WWF Tag Team Championship, The Smoking Gunns defended their title. Their opponents were Owen Hart and a mystery partner.

5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Stace looks at mysticism and logic. He returns {{to the idea that}} {{theology}} and mystical philosophies (he gives the examples of Vedanta, Spinoza, Hegel, and Bradley) will always contain contradictions. Known as the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mystery</b> of God, he maintains this is because the intellect is inherently incapable of understanding the Ultimate. All attempts to state the nature of the ultimate necessarily produce contradictions.|$|E
5|$|The attacks at Matawan are {{the subject}} of the National Geographic Channel {{documentary}} Attacks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mystery</b> Shark (2002), which examines the possibility that a bull shark was responsible for killing Stanley Fisher and Lester Stilwell; Discovery Channel's Blood in the Water (2009); and Smithsonian Channel's The Real Story: Jaws (2011).|$|E

5|$|The {{inconclusive}} {{nature of}} the hearings helped to foster continued speculation as to the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mystery,</b> and the story has repeatedly been complicated by false detail and fantasy. Hypotheses that have been advanced include the effects on the crew of alcohol fumes rising from the cargo, submarine earthquakes (seaquakes), waterspouts, attacks by giant squid, and paranormal intervention.|$|E
5|$|After the impact, villagers who had {{approached}} the impact site grew sick from a then-unexplained illness, {{with a wide}} array of symptoms. Two days later, Peruvian scientists confirmed that there had indeed been a meteorite strike, quieting widespread speculation that {{it may have been a}} geophysical rather than a celestial event. At that point, no further information on the cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mystery</b> illness was known. The ground water in the local area is known to contain arsenic compounds, and the illness is now believed to have been caused by arsenic poisoning incurred when residents of the area inhaled the vapor of the boiling arsenic-contaminated water.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in ancient}} times these {{similarities}} were controversial. Non-Christians in the Roman Empire in the early centuries CE thought Christianity and the mystery cults resembled each other. Reacting to these claims by outsiders, early Christian apologists denied that these cults had influenced their religion. The 17th-century Protestant scholar Isaac Casaubon brought up the question again by accusing the Catholic Church of deriving its sacraments from the rituals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mystery</b> cults. Charles-François Dupuis, in the late 18th century, went further by claiming that all Christianity originated in the mystery cults. Intensified by religious disputes between Protestants, Catholics, and non-Christians, the controversy has continued to the present day.|$|E

5|$|Some aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> <b>of</b> Isis and {{of other}} mystery cults, {{particularly}} their {{connection with the}} afterlife, resemble important elements <b>of</b> Christianity. <b>The</b> question <b>of</b> whether <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> influenced Christianity is controversial and the evidence is unclear; some scholars today attribute the similarities to a shared cultural background rather than direct influence. In contrast, Apuleius's account has had direct effects in modern times. Through his description <b>of</b> them, <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> <b>of</b> Isis have influenced many works of fiction and modern fraternal organizations, {{as well as a}} widespread, though false, belief that the ancient Egyptians themselves had an elaborate system of mystery initiations.|$|R
5|$|What {{at first}} {{seems to be}} an open-and-shut case becomes {{confused}} though, once it is learned that the Wolf is an investigative reporter.

5|$|The Chocobo {{series is}} a {{collection}} of video games published by Square, and later by Square Enix, featuring a recurring creature from the Final Fantasy series, the Chocobo, as the protagonist. The creature is a large and normally flightless bird which first appeared in Final Fantasy II and has been featured in almost all subsequent Final Fantasy games, as well as making cameo appearances in numerous other games. The Chocobo series of video games contains over 20 titles for video game consoles, mobile phones, and online platforms. These games include installments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mystery</b> Dungeon series of roguelike video games, racing games, adventure games, and minigame collections. Although the various games of the series have different game styles and are generally unrelated except by their inclusion of a Chocobo as the main character, Square Enix considers them to be a distinct series.|$|E

2500|$|As to <b>the</b> climax <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mysteries,</b> {{there are}} two modern theories.

Others hold this explanation to be insufficient {{to account for the}} power and longevity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mysteries,</b> and that <b>the</b> experiences must have been internal and mediated by a powerful psychoactive ingredient contained in the kykeon drink.

50|$|After {{the first}} novel, the {{children}} become amateur sleuths, {{and the subsequent}} series involves the children solving various mysteries and occasionally traveling to other locations as they do so. They stumble across a mystery {{no matter where they}} are, whether on vacation or in their own backyard. They usually solve <b>the</b> <b>mystery</b> with very little adult intervention, although adults are present in the novel (the author said she wrote about mostly-unsupervised children because that would appeal to children). Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> border on <b>the</b> supernatural, although the practical Henry and Jessie always find the practical reason for anything that appears other-worldy.

25|$|Theologians {{give the}} name mystery to {{revealed}} truths that surpass {{the powers of}} natural reason, so, in a narrow sense, the Mystery is a truth that transcends the created intellect.
