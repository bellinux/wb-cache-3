40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design of}} an <b>on-bed</b> rehabilitative exercise guidance and monitoring system that utilizes a high density sensor bedsheet to sense certain type and range of motion exercises. I propose and develop a new method to recognize rehabilitation actions and quantize body moving angles through analyzing theprogression of pressure images. I also present a way to construct 3 D models of patients from 2 D pressure images. The 3 D character model can not only reflect the rehabilitation exercises, but also the visualization synchronizes with the actions of patients. Our experimental results on five <b>on-bed</b> exercises show that this systemcan accurately recognize patient's exercising type and track compliance of patients to prescribed treatment programs. The system is easy to setup and is suitable for long term monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} an <b>on-bed</b> reha-bilitation exercise monitoring system that utilizes a high density sensor bedsheet to evaluate active range of motion exercises. We propose and develop a novel framework to analyze the progression of pressure image sequences using manifold learning. The image sequences are reduced to a low dimensional subspace that can be measured against expected prior data {{for each of the}} rehabilitation exercises. We also present a metric to compare manifold similarities. Our experimental results on five <b>on-bed</b> exercises show that this system can accurately track compliance of patients to prescribed treatment programs. It allows physical therapists to evaluate how well patients adhere to the rehabilitation exercises. The system is convenient to setup, unobtrusive, and can be used for reliable, long term monitoring.

Foveal thresholds were measured for flickering probes, and for static <b>ON-</b> and OFF-probes that have durations consistent with the flicker duty cycle. Thresholds were obtained using a probe-flash stimulus onset asynchrony paradigm. The outcome of the experiment suggests that flicker thresholds are lower than the component <b>ON-</b> and OFF-thresholds, and that the flicker response can be predicted by assuming probability summation between the <b>ON-</b> and OFF-mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Physical {{rehabilitation}} is {{an important}} process for patients recovering after surgery. In this paper, we propose and develop a framework to monitor <b>on-bed</b> range of motion exercises that allows physical therapists to evaluate patient adherence to set exercise programs. Using a dense pressure sensitive bedsheet, a sequence of pressure maps are produced and analyzed using man-ifold learning techniques. We compare two methods, Local Linear Embedding and Isomap, to reduce the dimensionality of the pres-sure map data. Once the image sequences are converted into a low dimensional manifold, the manifolds {{can be compared to}} expected prior data for the rehabilitation exercises. Furthermore, a mea-sure to compare the similarity of manifolds is presented along with experimental results for five <b>on-bed</b> rehabilitation exercises. The evaluation of this framework shows that exercise compliance can be tracked accurately according to prescribed treatment programs. Index Terms—Isomap, local linear embedding, manifold learn-ing, pressure images, range of motion, rehabilitation exercise. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Sleep {{monitoring}} {{is receiving}} increased {{attention in the}} healthcare community, because the quality of sleep has {{a great impact on}} human health. Existing in-home sleep monitoring devices are either obtrusive to the user or cannot provide adequate sleep information. To this end, we present SleepSense, a contactless and low-cost sleep monitoring system for home use that can continuously detect the sleep event. Specifically, SleepSense consists of three parts: an electromagnetic probe, a robust automated radar demodulation module, and a signal processing framework for sleep event recognition, including <b>on-bed</b> movement, bed exit, and breathing event. We present a prototype of the SleepSense system, and perform a set of comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of sleep monitoring. Using a real-case evaluation, experimental results in-dicate that SleepSense can perform effective sleep event detection and recognition in practice. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{proportion of}} older adults and corresponding costs associated with chronic disease management demand novel technological solutions. It is expected that new healthcare services will shift from clinical and hospital settings to a personalized and homebound environment. Along with the rapid advances in several technological domains including sensing, communication, and human factors design in the last decade, new technologies {{have led to the}} development of new mobile and personalized systems capable of analyzing and visualizing varying heterogeneous physiological signals. This dissertation presents an end-to-end research methodology for design and development of next generation wireless health applications, with a particular emphasis on innovative sensing systems design. I summarize my research in wireless health domain: from <b>On-bed</b> physiological signals monitoring, Contactless vital signs monitoring, Augmented visualization, Virtual reality based rehabilitation, to Social activity promotion. Each project involved medical problem identification, feasible solution development, and clinical verification. In this dissertation, I address novel hardware and software sensing and interaction technologies, including sensor system design, sensor modeling, and sensor signal processing. The ultimate goals of this interdisciplinary research are to support our medical hypothesis, verify the feasibility of technological solutions in clinics, and eventually enable wireless health from concept to practice...|$|E
40|$|The {{monitoring}} of human respiratory rate {{is essential in}} many clinical applications including the detection and mon-itoring of sleep disorders, the {{monitoring of}} newborns for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), and identifying pa-tients at high risk up to 24 hours before an adverse event like stroke and cardiac arrest [1]. Traditional noninvasive respiratory rate measurements in a hospital setting rely on clinical staff to visually track a patient’s chest movement {{for a period of}} time to derive the respiratory rate from the num-ber of movements observed. Failure to perform continuous and quantified measurements of respiratory rate could result in an inability to rescue a patient exhibiting respiratory dis-tress. Severe after effects hinder recovery and result in loss of time, cost, or even life. This paper proposes an e-textile pressure sensitive bed sheet to non-invasively and accurately measure respiratory rate by analyzing time-stamped pres-sure distribution sequences. The bed sheet provides a 24 / 7 quantified <b>on-bed</b> respiratory rate monitoring service. It is made of e-textile and is similar to a regular bed sheet in com-fort. As a result, it can seamlessly fit in common clinical or home environments, reducing the possible interference with a patient’s regular sleeping habits and resulting in a type of inconspicuous monitoring...|$|E

3000|$|In {{spite of}} their advantages, WBASNs face many issues, {{one of these is}} the limited energy [11] of both the on-body sensors and the in vivo pacemaker. The battery of the sensor/pacemaker {{exhausts}} quickly due to continuous communication. When the in vivo pacemaker or the sensor nodes deplete their energy, then it is either almost impossible (infeasible) to replace their batteries. In literature, many routing protocols have been proposed to prolong the battery lifetime of on-body sensors [12 – 14]. Similarly, many inductive links are designed to maximize the lifetime of pacemaker [15 – 17]. However, none of these works has jointly considered both problems. Thus, the motivation to enhance the lifetime of on-body sensors leads us to propose DARE and mutual information-based DARE (MI-DARE) routing protocols, and the motivation to recharge the implanted battery of pacemaker leads us to present a mathematical model for the non-invasive inductive link. However, patients under monitoring may show some degree of mobility such as postural changes of <b>on-bed</b> patients that may lead to topological changes and issues such as degradation in link quality and isolation of nodes from the network [18]. The network should be structured {{in such a way that}} the nodes are enabled to cater for these issues and provide satisfactory level of communication sessions. In order to account for the mobility, both the routing protocols and the non-invasive inductive link model are tested with the consideration of different topologies (scenarios 1 to 5 illustrated via Figs. 10 [...]...|$|E

40|$|Neuropsychiatric and {{cognitive}} symptoms {{are common in}} patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) from the early stage of the disease but their course is still unclear. In this study we investigated prospectively the progression of affective {{and cognitive}} symptoms and disorders in de novo idiopathic PD patients. Twenty-four de novo drug naïve PD patients underwent a comprehensive neurological, psychopathological and neuropsychological evaluation at the first diagnostic visit (OFF), after 4 - 6 months when the antiparkinsonian therapy regimen was stabilized (<b>ON-</b> 1), and at one year following the <b>ON-</b> 1 follow-up visit (<b>ON-</b> 2). Generalized least squares analysis revealed a significant improvement over time in the depressive mood, {{short and long term}} episodic verbal memory, visual memory, and the motor symptoms. Pairwise comparisons showed a significant change from OFF to <b>ON-</b> 1 for all the aforementioned variables, except for short term episodic verbal memory which approached significance. A significant improvement from <b>ON-</b> 1 to <b>ON-</b> 2, however, was shown for short term episodic verbal memory. An ancillary analysis indicated that overall level and change in a number of cognitive variables, but not depression, was conditional upon age of onset, education, and sometime gender. In conclusion, early stage PD is not associated with affective and cognitive deterioration. On the contrary, very specific neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms may improve. This study provides Class III evidence that antiparkinsonian treatment commonly used in the clinical practice improves memory performance and depression severity in de novo patients with PD. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
