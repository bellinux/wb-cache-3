40|$|Sustainable {{development}} creates {{new challenges}} for marketing and communication strategies. This is particularly so for packaging because consumers {{tend not to}} be aware of the potential environmental benefits of packaging other than those relating to disposal (recyclability, reuse, biodegradability and <b>over-packaging).</b> Optimal life cycle-based solutions may be counter-intuitive to consumer perception...|$|E
40|$|This senior project {{evaluates the}} {{measurement}} variation within a corrugated container bulge tester by utilizing a gauge repeatability and reproducibility study. Bulge {{is a type}} of deformation containers experience when subject to compressive forces such as stacking or internal forces due to under- and <b>over-packaging.</b> Both compressive and internal forces can accelerate the failure of a container by causing panels to flex and flutes to buckle, compromising structural integrity. Additionally, variable environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity can magnify the effect bulge has on a container, speeding up the failure rate of a container...|$|E
40|$|This study {{addresses}} the <b>over-packaging</b> phenomena in packaging design perspectives and, through {{the review of}} architectural design methods and packaging design principles, sets up a SyNalysis packaging design method with the packaging design process. Furthermore, {{an example of a}} PC magnifier redesigning is demonstrated in the thesis, step by step. The SyNalysis method contains scientific analytical methods and the designer 2 Ì† 7 s creative, synthetic methods. Its embodiment is presented in three processes: analysis, design and evaluation of the processes. The SyNalysis packaging design method serves as a guide to help packaging designers, and especially new and inexperienced designers pursue a more logical and practical way to create a better design. In addition, this packaging design method can also help packaging science students master packaging design skills in a more efficient way...|$|E
40|$|Diane Bisson {{presents}} {{her first}} book, a colourful and textured reflection on cooking and our dietary habits. In {{face of the}} proliferation of disposable containers and <b>over-packaging,</b> the author invites us {{to take up the}} challenge of transforming food into genuine design material. Flatware made of quinoa, plates for desert, biscuit drinking straws, 100 % edible lunches: such are the author's objectives. Edible, Food as material presents the results of this playful yet scientific journey with a collection of magnificent photographs and over thirty food samples designed and developed by the author. Her research rests on a vision resolutely linked with sustainable development as it explores the concept of the edible plate as both cultural model and viable material for the reduction of waste. Edible, Food as material fuses art with science to present the possible scope of a future series of edible plates and containers. " - Publisher's website...|$|E
