500|$|In {{the opening}} scene, the two aliens Kang and Kodos {{introduce}} a variety show, {{with a live}} audience consisting of aliens. While they tell jokes, canned laughter is played, but the audience appears unamused. The Simpson family sits <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> <b>with</b> Homer appearing as the jack-in-the-box from [...] "Treehouse of Horror II", Marge as the witch from [...] "Treehouse of Horror VIII", Bart as the half-fly mutant from [...] "Treehouse of Horror VIII". Maggie is the alien/human mutant from [...] "Treehouse of Horror IX" [...] and Lisa {{is the victim of}} an axe murder. Lisa then asks what aliens have to do with Halloween, and Maggie, in Kang's voice, says, [...] "Silence!", and disintegrates her with a ray gun.|$|E
60|$|At {{that moment}} I stepped forward so that <b>the</b> light fell <b>on</b> me. <b>The</b> old gentleman <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> rose <b>with</b> some {{difficulty}} and bowed with much courtesy. He was a fine-looking old man, with deep-set dark eyes, a pale face that bore many traces {{of physical and}} mental suffering, and a long white beard.|$|R
6000|$|... '"Ah yes, I {{would talk}} with thee, but be thou seated. It wearies {{me to look}} so high," [...] and she made room for me beside her <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> placing herself <b>with</b> {{her back against the}} end, so as to have a view of my face.|$|R
6000|$|His father darted at him {{a glance}} of indignation, which {{softened}} into sorrow as he saw him sink down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> exhausted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> scene he had undergone. He left the apartment, and Jeanie followed him, George Staunton raising himself as she passed the door-way, and pronouncing the word, [...] "Remember!" [...] in a tone as monitory as it was uttered by Charles I. upon the scaffold. The elder Staunton led the way into a small parlour, and shut the door.|$|R
500|$|Jason {{has also}} been {{referenced}} by several television shows. The stop motion animated television show Robot Chicken features Jason in three of its comedy sketches. In episode seventeen, [...] "", the mystery-solving teenagers from Scooby-Doo arrive at Camp Crystal Lake to investigate the Jason Voorhees murders, and are killed off one by one. Velma is the only survivor, and in typical Scooby-Doo fashion, she rips off Jason's mask to reveal his true identity: Old Man Phillips. In episode nineteen, [...] "That Hurts Me", Jason reappears, this time as a housemate of [...] "Horror Movie Big Brother", alongside other famous slasher movie killers such as Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Leatherface, Pinhead, and Ghostface. Three years later, in episode sixty-two, Jason is shown on the days before and after a typical Friday the 13th. Jason is spoofed in the season five episode of Family Guy entitled [...] "It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One". The so-called [...] "Mr. Voorhees" [...] explains to Asian reporter Trisha Takanawa how happy he is to see local wildlife return following the cleanup and rejuvenation of Lake Quahog. He reappears later in the episode as {{the manager of the}} [...] "Britches and Hose" [...] clothing store. As opposed to his monstrous personality in the films, Jason is depicted here as polite and articulate, albeit still a psychopath; he murders random swimmers and threatens to kill his employee if she screws up. In an episode of The Simpsons, Jason appears in a Halloween episode sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>with</b> Freddy Krueger waiting for the family to arrive. When Freddy asks where the family is, Jason responds, [...] "Ehh, whaddya gonna do?" [...] and turns the TV on. He also appears in The Simpsons episode [...] "Stop, or My Dog Will Shoot!", alongside Pinhead, menacing Bart in a fantasy sequence. The South Park episodes [...] "Imaginationland EpisodeII" [...] and [...] "III" [...] feature Jason among an assortment of other villains and monsters as an inhabitant of the [...] "bad side" [...] of Imaginationland, a world populated by fictional characters. This version of Jason has an effeminate voice and describes the removal of Strawberry Shortcake's eyeball as [...] "super hardcore". Experimental pop artist Eric Millikin created a large mosaic portrait of Jason Voorhees out of Halloween candy and spiders as part of his [...] "Totally Sweet" [...] series in 2013.|$|E
2500|$|The New Riders of the Purple Sage, which, in mid-1970, {{featured}} Jerry Garcia on pedal-steel guitar, {{as well as}} Mickey Hart as occasional percussionist. Also, John Dawson {{is seen in the}} hilarious [...] "Ain't No More Cane" [...] scene, sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>with</b> Rick Danko and Janis Joplin, as {{they work}} through several drunken verses of the tune. Buddy Cage can also be seen, performing as a member of Great Speckled Bird.|$|E
2500|$|On November 22, 2011, Toni Annette Medrano accidentally {{killed her}} 3-week-old son, Adrian Alexander Medrano, {{while she was}} {{sleeping}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>with</b> him. According to the criminal complaint, Medrano told police she had consumed almost an entire fifth of vodka the night before her son died and fell asleep {{with him on a}} couch. The following morning, she woke up and found her infant son unresponsive and cold to the touch. While Grace was covering the case, she infamously dubbed Medrano [...] "Vodka Mom". During one of her shows, Grace brought a bottle of vodka onto her set and poured shots to demonstrate how much Medrano had drunk the night of her son's death. In June 2012, Medrano was charged with two counts of second-degree manslaughter. If convicted on both counts, Medrano would have faced a maximum of ten years in prison.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to say that I have no news," [...] he said to Lady Greendale, who was lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> worn out <b>with</b> weeping. [...] "I have ascertained almost beyond doubt {{that they did not}} land at the club stage or either of the other two landing places." ...|$|R
50|$|Day 11 opens <b>with</b> him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> {{surrounded}} <b>with</b> razor wire, {{holding a}} crude weapon {{made from a}} tennis racket. The power is off again. When the power comes back on he starts smashing a chair, making too much noise. Another buzz of the doorbell brings the police, telling him to keep down the racket. The police officer also asks what the smell in the apartment is. Danny answers that it is dinner. Danny re-enters the apartment and opens a casserole in the oven to find his pet cat, charred.|$|R
50|$|A {{music video}} was {{released}} for <b>the</b> song <b>on</b> 20 January 2012 with Nina Nesbitt and currently has over 84 million views <b>on</b> YouTube. <b>The</b> video, {{written and directed}} by Saman Kesh, starts with Sheeran coming home and sitting down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> depressed. As he opens a can of beer, he notices his cat talking to him. Together they drink beer and do various activities, and later they go to a pub. Sheeran and his cat are kicked out when a person takes a photo of Sheeran and his cat starts a fight with that person. They bring several women and cats home to party and Sheeran starts hallucinating from his intoxication. The video ends with Sheeran waking up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same <b>couch</b> <b>with</b> his cat next to him and a can of beer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table. Throughout the video, Sheeran continues to have flashbacks of a particular woman and looks depressed immediately after, implying that she is Sheeran's ex-girlfriend who recently broke up with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit down--tell {{me about}} it--can I do any thing?" [...] and Belle began to plump up the pillows <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>with</b> nervous eagerness.|$|E
60|$|When he {{came back}} to his room, Sophy was curled up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>with</b> a {{cigarette}} between her lips. She looked at him severely.|$|E
6000|$|... [He sits <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>with</b> a {{piece of}} paper on his knees, adding [...] a few words with a stylo pen to what is already written.] ...|$|E
5000|$|After interminable choruses of [...] "Home! Sweet Home!", {{the four}} boys are finally ready to leave, but {{are forced to}} stay in the Hood home due to a sudden thunderstorm. Both Darla and her mother are delighted, but Mr. Hood is dismayed, {{especially}} when he is told that he must share his bed with the Four Nightengales. Driven crazy by the boys' unintentionally disruptive shenanigans, Mr. Hood escapes to the living room and tries to sleep <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> covering himself <b>with</b> a bear rug to keep warm. Naturally, the gang mistake him for a real bear, and comic chaos ensues.|$|R
5000|$|The play takes a turn {{when the}} stage {{directions}} call for Dot {{to be drawn}} into Exit's arms while begging Buddy to say he loves her, and the lights go out. Buddy relights the stage with a match, and Exit Mann turns, showing a limp and silent Dot. Exit Mann's appearance is revealed by Buddy's match as the [...] "Hollow eyes and fleshless cheeks of Death". The room suddenly reverts to how it was {{in the beginning of the}} play. Dot is back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> bed, <b>with</b> Buddy sleeping next to it. Dot struggles to wake up, and yells out Buddy's name. She calls to him, saying, [...] "Buddy, do you love me? Say you love me 'fore I go!" [...] Dot suddenly stretches rigid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bed, and Buddy wakes with a start. He calls out and touches Dot, who is now presumably dead. He professes his love for her as the curtain falls.|$|R
50|$|The next day, Ida asks Misty out. They go on a date, and Misty asks if {{they can}} watch a movie about “Texas Pixies” on Ida's DVD player, which Ida accepts. Misty is {{introduced}} to Betty and the apartment, though Ida keeps {{her away from the}} bedroom where all her insects are hidden. The two get closer until interrupted by Max. Ida returns to find Misty asleep <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b> She returns <b>with</b> a pillow (that has Mick inside) to give to Misty. In gratitude for Ida allowing her to stay, Misty returns the favor by seducing Ida. Unknowingly, Mick’s proboscis nips Misty's ear, which Misty dismisses.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'VE {{finished}} my book, {{and now what}} CAN I do till this tiresome rain is over?" [...] exclaimed Carrie, as she lay back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>with</b> a yawn of weariness.|$|E
60|$|JULIA (sitting {{down again}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>with</b> rueful humour). Well, you shall not {{experiment}} on me any more. Go to your Grace {{if you want}} a victim. She'll be a tough one.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Hannah was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>with</b> her wounds {{partially}} bandaged {{when the}} boy returned, and although her suffering must have been severe, that placid face was as serene as when he bade her good-night.|$|E
5000|$|The corps {{took part}} in George B. McClellan's Peninsula Campaign of 1862, playing {{a major role in}} repulsing Confederate attacks at Seven Pines and Malvern Hill. After the campaign, IV Corps {{remained}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Peninsula, <b>with</b> <b>Couch's</b> division later detached. The corps was attached to the Department of Virginia under John A. Dix, and took part (along with VII Corps) in minor diversionary actions against Richmond during the Gettysburg Campaign. The corps was officially discontinued on August 1, 1863. Elements of IV Corps were later absorbed into XVIII Corps.|$|R
50|$|From September 2002 to December 2007 Murnaghan was a main {{presenter}} of BBC Breakfast, replacing Jeremy Bowen. He {{presented the}} show alongside Sophie Raworth, Natasha Kaplinsky, Kate Silverton, Sian Williams and Susanna Reid. He {{was also a}} regular stand-in <b>on</b> <b>the</b> BBC Six O'Clock News and BBC Ten O'Clock News and co-presented the BBC News at Six on Fridays from September 2003 to summer 2007 alongside Sian Williams. His presenting style was lampooned in the impersonation sketch show Dead Ringers by Jon Culshaw, his widely spaced legs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> presenting <b>couch</b> mocked <b>with</b> <b>the</b> phrase 'I'm Dermot Murnaghan, watch my crotch follow you round the room'.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{begins to}} insult Lois about her {{advancing}} age, including her minor strands of gray hair. This makes her extremely self-conscious, and soon Lois {{becomes aware of}} her lust for a younger man. After introducing her new boyfriend, Anthony, to the family, Meg goes on to make out <b>with</b> him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> family <b>couch,</b> <b>with</b> Lois watching over nearby. Jealous of her daughter's new-found love, she begins hitting on Anthony. Later that day, Lois sends Meg {{to pick up her}} grandfather, leaving her all alone with Anthony. The two then begin making out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> but Meg returns to the house only a few moments later and discovers them. Angry at her mother for ruining her chance at having a normal boyfriend, Meg threatens Lois to lay off of him, pulling out one of her own teeth in frustration. Lois quickly agrees, but is still angry with Peter for continually insulting her. She confronts him about this, and he admits that he was actually embarrassed about his own advancing age, as well as his lack of fitness, and was only insulting Lois in order to distract her from the fact that she could be with a much better-looking man. He apologizes for his behavior, and Lois forgives him.|$|R
60|$|He started! He {{was still}} on the doorstep! Freddy was {{drumming}} on the pane, and behind, there was a man lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> <b>with</b> his face buried in his hands. He waved his hand and descended the steps firmly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{heaven for}} that!" [...] cried Polly, with the heartiest {{satisfaction}} in her voice. [...] "Now come {{and tell me}} all about it," [...] she added, sitting down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>with</b> the air of one who has escaped a great peril.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{fellow who}} is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>with</b> Haskers," [...] whispered Dave. [...] "He {{used to go}} to school with us at Oak Hall, and then he had to leave, and after that he and a fellow named Jasniff robbed Mr. Wadsworth's jewelry works." ...|$|E
5000|$|The clearly frightened boys {{make plans}} to move far away and {{advertise}} for someone {{to go with them}} and share the travel expenses. The person involved is actually Butch's girlfriend (Mae Busch). Butch soon manages to escape by leaping from a train, and makes his way to his girlfriend's apartment, where Stan and Ollie ring the bell. Butch hides in a large trunk, thinking it's the cops at the door; the trunk gets locked and Butch can't get out. The boys do their best to get him out, not realizing who the trapped person really is. After several inept attempts at freeing him, Butch notices (and recognizes) Ollie through a bored hole. His suggestion of using a blowtorch to melt the lock off backfires as Butch is set <b>on</b> fire. <b>The</b> boys hose Butch down and he frees himself from the trunk, taking his promised revenge <b>on</b> them as <b>the</b> cops arrive shortly afterwards. The film ends with Stan and Ollie sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> both <b>with</b> their legs snapped off and tied around their necks. Then Ollie said his [...] "another nice mess…" [...] catchphrase to Stan. Stan whimpers.|$|R
5000|$|Bailey has an on-again, off-again {{romance with}} Dr. Johnny Fever. In the early episodes, it is {{suggested}} that Bailey looks up to Johnny as her mentor in the world of broadcasting, but that she also has a schoolgirl crush <b>on</b> him. In <b>the</b> third season Bailey and Fever are seen in <b>the</b> bullpen lounging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> together <b>with</b> Bailey's arm familiarly placed around Johnny's shoulders (Out to Lunch episode). By the fourth season, their relationship develops into what Smithers characterized as [...] "more adult", giving both characters another dimension to develop, which leads Bailey to ask him out on a date in the second-season opener, [...] "For Love or Money". However, their relationship never seems to go further than the occasional date. (It is implied at the end of [...] "For Love or Money" [...] and [...] "Mike Fright" [...] that they have had at least casual sexual relations, though in both cases, it could be discounted as hyperbole.) In season four's [...] "Rumors," [...] when Johnny stays at Bailey's place for a few days, Bailey is infuriated by the gossip that they are sleeping together, disappointing Johnny, who was hoping that the rumors would come true.|$|R
5000|$|Born in Chamalières in the Puy-de-Dôme, Batho {{graduated}} in photography from the École des arts appliqués in 1956. [...] She {{went on to}} work in the archives at the Bibliothèque nationale de France where she met her husband, John Batho, also a photographer. Her black-and-white photographs, published in Le Moment des Choses, document details of the inside of her home: a broom leaning against a wall, a fading bunch of flowers, her little daughter asleep <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> all represented <b>with</b> surprising intensity, evoking a feeling of nostalgia and sadness. Her images of Claude Monet's garden at Giverny, taken in October 1980, shortly before she died, also include glimpses of her family, almost as if their fleeting figures were included by accident. The square-shaped prints contrast sharply with the formats of Monet's own works.|$|R
60|$|Captain Richard Beverley, on his {{way through}} the hotel smoking room to the Savoy bar, stopped short. He looked at the girl who had half risen from her seat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>with</b> a sudden impulse of half startled recognition. Her little smile of welcome was entirely convincing.|$|E
60|$|Isaac {{reclined}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>with</b> {{his head}} and shoulder propped up by pillows. He was the handsomest of the brothers. His face would have been but for the marks of privation, singularly like Betty's; the same low, level brows and dark eyes; the same mouth, though the lips were stronger and without the soft curves which made his sister's mouth so sweet.|$|E
60|$|I glanced {{round to}} see {{the effect of this}} vision upon my companions. It was most peculiar. Hans had sunk to his knees; his hands were joined in the {{attitude}} of prayer and his ugly little face reminded me of that of a big fish out of water and dying from excess of air. Robertson, startled out of his abstraction, stared at the royal-looking woman <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>with</b> his mouth open.|$|E
50|$|STAGE 4 (<b>on</b> view inside <b>the</b> motel, {{and when}} Bartok arrives to {{retrieve}} Martin): Martin (his voice now even deeper) {{has begun to}} instinctively pull the webbing {{out of his own}} body and wrap it around himself. As it hardens, the webbing begins to form a cocoon. At this point, Martin's legs have been enveloped by said cocoon. Now that Martin is no longer wearing clothes, a hideous assortment of lumps and bumps can be seen on his discolored body, his face and head are even more distorted, and his teeth and ears are receding. Some of his fingers are webbed together with flaps of skin, and claws are growing on his knuckles. Martin removes his human right eye in this stage to reveal an orange insect eye behind it. The most complex makeup, this stage took some 12 hours to apply to Eric Stoltz, and he was required to remain immobile <b>on</b> <b>the</b> motel <b>couch</b> (<b>with</b> his legs inside the partial cocoon) all that time, as well as during the additional hours of filming that immediately followed. Body makeup and gelatin bumps were added to Stoltz's arms and torso, in addition to the makeup appliances covering his face and head.|$|R
50|$|With Eddie's legs back on, {{it is now}} 5 o'clock (seven {{hours before}} the bus leaves), and Richie watches an alarm clock with hysterical pre-holiday jitters; so, when Richie {{suggests}} checking {{how long it takes}} to get to the bus station two streets away, Eddie gladly accepts the opportunity to get out of the flat, and spends the next few hours at the pub. When Richie tries the same round-trip to the bus station, completing it in only twelve and a half minutes, Eddie uses the opportunity to steal the holiday money and spends another few hours drinking at the pub, returning home and passing out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> at 11:55. <b>With</b> Eddie unconscious, Richie sneakily tries again to lift the fridge and see the nude photo of Lynam; and, thanks to an answered prayer, is successful. He lies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor under the elevated fridge for a close look.|$|R
2500|$|The {{music video}} of Jennifer Lopez's song, [...] "Dance Again", which aired <b>on</b> <b>the</b> program, was criticized as {{inappropriate}} for younger viewers. Dan Gainor of the Culture and Media Institute wrote, [...] "Even the supposedly family-friendly TV shows like American Idol are never {{safe in the}} hands of Hollywood," [...] and went as far as saying her [...] "skanky new video shows how desperate she is to retain her fame despite her fading relevance. Such sexualized videos aren't appropriate for any children to watch, including Lopez's own twins." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein from MTV Buzzworthy also commented about the video's content not being appropriate for a family show, [...] "we thought [...] "Idol" [...] was a family show? This video is less [...] "sit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> and chill <b>with</b> dad" [...] and more [...] "call your boyfriend over immediately." [...] Ed Masley from AZ central.com said that <b>the</b> video was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> verge of being too [...] "steamy" [...] for the show.|$|R
