5|$|Crickets {{are found}} in many habitats. Members of several subfamilies {{are found in}} the upper tree canopy, in bushes, and among grasses and herbs. They also occur on the ground and in caves, and some are subterranean, {{excavating}} shallow or deep burrows.

5|$|Lactifluus piperatus forms part of {{an unusual}} and highly {{regarded}} dish in North America, being one of several species parasitized by the lobster mushroom Hypomyces lactifluorum. Once colonized by the parasite, an orange-red crust forms <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the mushroom, and the taste becomes delicious as the parasite infiltrates its host's tissues. It is also a common source of food among red squirrels.|$|E
5|$|Wet {{deposits}} of ash on high voltage insulators can initiate a leakage current (small amount of current flow across the insulator surface) which, if sufficient current is achieved, can cause ‘flashover’ (the unintended electrical discharge around or <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> an insulating material).|$|E

5|$|About 40percent of the tributaries that {{originally}} flowed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the watershed were piped or relocated during urban development, {{especially on the}} north side of the main stem. Generally, the remaining free-flowing tributaries begin south of the main stem and run north; the major exception is Crystal Springs Creek, which begins as a groundwater discharge and flows south. The other major tributaries are Hogan, Kelley, Butler, Sunshine, and Badger creeks. Crystal Springs and Kelley creeks contribute more flow to the main stem than the other tributaries.|$|E
5|$|Nemerteans lack {{specialized}} gills, and respiration occurs <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the body, {{which is}} long and sometimes flattened. Like other animals with thick body walls, they use fluid circulation rather than diffusion to move substances through their bodies. The circulatory system consists of the rhynchocoel and peripheral vessels, while blood of other invertebrates is contained in the main body cavity. The fluid in the rhynchocoel moves substances {{to and from the}} proboscis, and functions as a fluid skeleton in everting the proboscis and in burrowing. The vessels circulate fluid round the whole body and the rhynchocoel provides its own local circulation. The circulatory vessels are a system of coeloms.|$|E
5|$|The bull {{appears to}} have had a sacred role in a number of Celtic cults. The animal was viewed {{positively}} by the Celts as an image of fertility and abundance; one tribe, the Taurini, even adopted the bull's name. It is unknown how it came to be associated with bodies of water {{in the form of the}} water bull, but historian and symbologist Charles Milton Smith has suggested that such mythological creatures might originate with the water spouts that can form <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> Scottish lochs, which can give the impression of a living form as they move across the water.|$|E

5|$|The major {{means of}} {{respiration}} in teleosts, {{as in most}} other fish, is the transfer of gases <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the gills as water is drawn in through the mouth and pumped out through the gills. Apart from the swim bladder, which contains {{a small amount of}} air, the body does not have oxygen reserves, and respiration needs to be continuous over the fish's life. Some teleosts exploit habitats where the oxygen availability is low, such as stagnant water or wet mud; they have developed accessory tissues and organs to support gas exchange in these habitats.|$|E
5|$|Enamel is {{the hardest}} and most highly mineralized {{substance}} of the body. It {{is one of the}} four major tissues which make up the tooth, along with dentin, cementum, and dental pulp. It is normally visible and must be supported by underlying dentin. 96% of enamel consists of mineral, with water and organic material comprising the rest. The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white. At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any restorative dental material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. Enamel varies in thickness <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the tooth and is often thickest at the cusp, up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the CEJ. The wear rate of enamel, called attrition, is 8 micrometers a year from normal factors.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008 the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) scientists, Hugh Corr and David Vaughan, {{reported}} that 2,200years ago a volcano erupted under the Antarctic ice sheet. This {{was the biggest}} Antarctic eruption in the last 10,000years. The volcano is situated in the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier. The eruption spread a layer of volcanic ash (or tephra) <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the ice sheet. This ash was then buried under the snow and ice. Corr and Vaughan were able to map this ash layer using an airborne radar system and calculate {{the date of the}} eruption from the depth of burial of the ash. This method uses dates calculated from nearby ice cores. The presence of the volcano raises the possibility that volcanic activity could have contributed, or may contribute in the future, to increases in the flow of the glacier.|$|E

5|$|In the game's single-player mode, {{the player}} must {{complete}} {{a series of}} levels where different types of AI-controlled enemies will try to hinder the player's progress. The game primarily takes place inside labyrinthine underground facilities, but the player can occasionally travel <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the planets where the facilities are buried to reach other nearby areas. The underground facilities are composed {{of a set of}} tunnels and rooms separated by doors. Most of them can be opened by either firing weapons at them or bumping into them, but others require special actions to be performed first before entry is allowed. For instance, some doors require special keys to open them. To finish a level and proceed to the next one, the player must complete a certain set of objectives, ranging from collecting items to activating switches, defeating enemies, and destroying objects, among others. Some levels also feature optional objectives that are not critical but add to the player's overall completion score.|$|E
5|$|Paxillus involutus can {{be found}} growing on lawns and old meadows {{throughout}} its distribution. Fruit bodies are generally terrestrial, {{though they may be}} found on woody material around tree stumps. They generally appear in autumn and late summer. In California, David Arora discerned a larger form associated with oak and pine which appears in late autumn and winter, as well as the typical form that is associated with birch plantings and appears in autumn. Several species of flies and beetles have been recorded using the fruit bodies to rear their young. The mushroom can be infected by Hypomyces chrysospermus, or bolete eater, a mould species that parasitises Boletales members. Infection results in the appearance of a whitish powder that first manifests on the pores, then spreads <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the mushroom, becoming golden yellow to reddish-brown in maturity.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, {{a section}} funded by MI6 {{was created for}} propaganda, headed by Sir Campbell Stuart. It was {{allocated}} premises at Electra House and was dubbed Department EH. On 25 September 1939 the unit was mobilised to Woburn Abbey where it joined a subversion team from MI6, known as Section D, and by July these teams {{became a part of}} the newly created Special Operations Executive (SOE). These SOE elements went on to form the core of the Political Warfare Executive in 1941. Their task was to spread false rumours and conduct psychological warfare. Inspired by a demonstration of petroleum warfare, one false rumour stated that the British had a new bomb: dropped from an aircraft, it caused a thin film of volatile liquid to spread <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the water which it then ignited. Such rumours were credible and rapidly spread. American broadcaster William Shirer recorded large numbers of burns victims in Berlin; though {{it is not clear what}} he personally saw, it seems likely his reports were influenced by rumours. The interrogation of a Luftwaffe pilot revealed the existence of such weapons was common knowledge, and documents found after the war showed the German high command were deceived. The rumour seemed to take on a life of its own on both sides leading to persistent stories of a thwarted German invasion, in spite of official British denials. On 15 December 1940, The New York Times ran a story claiming that tens of thousands of German troops had been 'consumed by fire' in two failed invasion attempts.|$|E

50|$|In {{uniaxial}} compression the forces are directed along one direction only, {{so that they}} act towards decreasing the object's length along that direction. The compressive forces may also be applied in multiple directions; for example inwards {{along the edges of}} a plate or all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> side <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> a cylinder, so as to reduce its area (biaxial compression), or inwards <b>over</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> a body, so as to reduce its volume.|$|R
5|$|Turbulent {{forces in}} {{air and water}} affect the {{environment}} and ecosystem distribution, form and dynamics. On a planetary scale, ecosystems are affected by circulation patterns in the global trade winds. Wind power and the turbulent forces it creates can influence heat, nutrient, and biochemical profiles of ecosystems. For example, wind running <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> a lake creates turbulence, mixing the water column and influencing the environmental profile to create thermally layered zones, affecting how fish, algae, {{and other parts of}} the aquatic ecosystem are structured. Wind speed and turbulence also influence evapotranspiration rates and energy budgets in plants and animals. Wind speed, temperature and moisture content can vary as winds travel across different land features and elevations. For example, the westerlies come into contact with the coastal and interior mountains of western North America to produce a rain shadow on the leeward side of the mountain. The air expands and moisture condenses as the winds increase in elevation; this is called orographic lift and can cause precipitation. This environmental process produces spatial divisions in biodiversity, as species adapted to wetter conditions are range-restricted to the coastal mountain valleys and unable to migrate across the xeric ecosystems (e.g., of the Columbia Basin in western North America) to intermix with sister lineages that are segregated to the interior mountain systems.|$|E
5|$|Wind blowing <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the sea causes {{friction}} at {{the interface}} between air and sea. Not only does this cause waves to form but it also makes the surface seawater move {{in the same direction}} as the wind. Although winds are variable, in any one place they predominantly blow from a single direction and thus a surface current can be formed. Westerly winds are most frequent in the mid-latitudes while easterlies dominate the tropics. When water moves in this way, other water flows in to fill the gap and a circular movement of surface currents known as a gyre is formed. There are five main gyres in the world's oceans: two in the Pacific, two in the Atlantic, and one in the Indian Ocean. The North Atlantic gyre that produces the Sargasso Sea accumulates salinity levels as high as 38‰. Other smaller gyres are found in lesser seas and a single gyre flows around Antarctica. These gyres have followed the same routes for millennia, guided by the topography of the land, the wind direction, and the Coriolis effect. The surface currents flow in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The water moving away from the equator is warm, while that flowing towards it has lost most of its heat. These currents tend to moderate the Earth's climate, cooling the equatorial region, and warming regions at higher latitudes. Global climate and weather forecasts are powerfully affected by the world ocean, so global climate modelling makes use of ocean circulation models as well as models of other major components such as the atmosphere, land surfaces, aerosols, and sea ice. Ocean models make use of a branch of physics, geophysical fluid dynamics, that describes the large-scale flow of fluids such as seawater.|$|E
