I know how keen you are upon these things, and I {{would take it}} as a great favour if you would step down to Appledore Towers, and give us the benefit of your advice. It is no <b>ordinary</b> <b>crime.</b> We have had our eyes upon this Mr. Milverton for some time, and, between ourselves, he {{was a bit of a}} villain. He is known to have held papers which he used for blackmailing purposes. These papers have all been burned by the murderers. No article of value was taken, as it is probable that the criminals were men of good position, whose sole object was to prevent social exposure." ...|$|E
6000|$|This is {{precisely}} our present case--a case of rebellion wherein {{the public safety}} does require the suspension--Indeed, arrests by process of courts and arrests in cases of rebellion do not proceed altogether upon the same basis. The former is directed at the small percentage of ordinary and continuous perpetration of crime, while the latter is directed at sudden and extensive uprisings against the government, which, at most, will succeed or fail in no great length of time. In the latter case arrests are made {{not so much for}} what has been done as for what probably would be done. The latter is more for the preventive and less for the vindictive than the former. In such cases the purposes of men are much more easily understood than in cases of <b>ordinary</b> <b>crime.</b> The man who stands by and says nothing when the peril of his government is discussed, cannot be misunderstood. If not hindered, he is sure to help the enemy; much more if he talks ambiguously--talks for his country with [...] "buts," [...] and [...] "ifs," [...] and [...] "ands." [...] Of how little value the constitutional provision I have quoted will be rendered if arrests shall never be made until defined crimes shall have been committed, may be illustrated by a few notable examples: General John C. Breckinridge, General Robert E. Lee, General Joseph E. Johnston, General John B. Magruder, General William B. Preston, General Simon B. Buckner, and Commodore Franklin Buchanan, now occupying the very highest places in the rebel war service, were all within the power of the government since the rebellion began, and were nearly as well known to be traitors then as now. Unquestionably if we had seized and had them the insurgent cause would be much weaker. But no one of them had then committed any crime defined in the law. Every one of them, if arrested, would have been discharged on habeas corpus were the writ allowed to operate. In view of these and similar cases, I think the time not unlikely to come when I shall be blamed for having made too few arrests rather than too many.|$|E
6000|$|The {{existence}} of witchcraft was, no doubt, received and credited in England, {{as in the}} countries on the Continent, and originally punished accordingly. But after the fourteenth century the practices which fell under such a description were thought unworthy of any peculiar animadversion, unless they were connected with something {{which would have been}} of itself a capital crime, by whatever means it had been either essayed or accomplished. Thus the supposed paction between a witch and the demon was perhaps deemed in itself to have terrors enough to prevent its becoming an <b>ordinary</b> <b>crime,</b> and was not, therefore, visited with any statutory penalty. But to attempt or execute bodily harm to others through means of evil spirits, or, in a word, by the black art, was actionable at common law as much as if the party accused had done the same harm with an arrow or pistol-shot. The destruction or abstraction of goods by the like instruments, supposing the charge proved, would, in like manner, be punishable. A fortiori, the consulting soothsayers, familiar spirits, or the like, and the obtaining and circulating pretended prophecies to the unsettlement of the State and the endangering of the King's title, is yet a higher degree of guilt. And it may be remarked that the inquiry into the date of the King's life bears a close affinity with the desiring or compassing the death of the Sovereign, which is the essence of high treason. Upon such charges repeated trials took place in the courts of the English, and condemnations were pronounced, with sufficient justice, no doubt, where the connexion between the resort to sorcerers and the design to perpetrate a felony could be clearly proved. We would not, indeed, be disposed to go the length of so high an authority as Selden, who pronounces (in his [...] "Table-Talk") that if a man heartily believed that he could take the life of another by waving his hat three times and crying Buzz! and should, under this fixed opinion, wave his hat and cry Buzz! accordingly, he ought to be executed as a murderer. But a false prophecy of the King's death is not to be dealt with exactly on the usual principle; because, however idle in itself, the promulgation of such a prediction has, in times such as we are speaking of, a strong tendency to work its completion.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In Re Civilian Casualty Court Martial, {{disciplinary}} charges preferred {{against two}} Australian commandos accused of causing {{the deaths of}} five civilians during a night-time raid in Afghanistan were dismissed as being wrong in law. Despite the relevance of ‘war crimes’ under the Criminal Code (Cth) to their conduct, the charges preferred against the commandos {{were based on the}} <b>ordinary</b> <b>crimes</b> of ‘manslaughter’ and ‘dangerous conduct’, available under the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 (Cth). Through an analysis of the decision to dismiss the charges as wrong in law, this article discusses the issues raised by the prosecution of breaches of international humanitarian law using the Australian military justice system, and asks whether disciplinary charges based on <b>ordinary</b> <b>crimes,</b> or war crimes, should be preferred when prosecuting such breaches...|$|R

5000|$|Mystery fiction {{may involve}} a supernatural mystery where the {{solution}} {{does not have}} to be logical, and even no crime involved. This usage was common in the pulp magazines of the 1930s and 1940s, where titles such as Dime Mystery, Thrilling Mystery and Spicy Mystery offered what at the time were described as [...] "weird menace" [...] stories—supernatural horror in the vein of Grand Guignol. This contrasted with parallel titles of the same names which contained conventional hardboiled crime fiction. The first use of [...] "mystery" [...] in this sense was by Dime Mystery, which started out as an <b>ordinary</b> <b>crime</b> fiction magazine but switched to [...] "weird menace" [...] during the latter part of 1933.|$|E
50|$|To {{be convicted}} of an <b>ordinary</b> <b>crime,</b> in certain jurisdictions, a person {{must not only}} have {{committed}} a criminal action, but also have had a deliberate intention or guilty mind (mens rea). In a crime of strict liability (criminal) or absolute liability, a person could be guilty {{even if there was}} no intention to commit a crime. The difference between strict and absolute liability is whether the defence of a mistake of fact is available: in a crime of absolute liability, a mistake of fact is not a defence.Strict or Absolute Liability- also can arise from inherently dangerous activities or defective products that are likely to result in a harm to another, regardless of protection taken. Negligence is not required to be proven. Example: Owning a pet rattle snake.|$|E

50|$|Because the {{intended}} victim was the King of Great Britain, James Hadfield {{was charged with}} treason. This charge proved to be critical in determining {{the result of his}} case because it entitled him to several rights that were not given to criminals who had attempted to kill an ordinary person. First of all, the testimony of two witnesses, instead of just one, was needed to prove him guilty, since this was not an <b>ordinary</b> <b>crime</b> (The Treason Act 1800 was passed in July 1800 to make treason by attempting to kill the King subject to the same rules of evidence and procedure as a normal murder trial). Second and more importantly, he could demand that the court provide him with two defence counsels that would argue his case for him, instead of having to act as his own defence. Hadfield chose Thomas Erskine as his chief counsel. At the time, Erskine was regarded as the best lawyer in England.|$|E

5000|$|Amnesty International {{campaigns for}} the release of prisoners of conscience, which include both {{political}} prisoners as well as those imprisoned for their religious or philosophical beliefs. To reduce controversy, {{and as a matter of}} principle, the organization's policy applies only to prisoners who have not committed or advocated violence. Thus, there are political prisoners who do not fit the narrower criteria for POCs. The organisation defines the differences as follows:AI uses the term [...] "political prisoner" [...] broadly. It does not use it, as some others do, to imply that all such prisoners have a special status or should be released. It uses the term only to define a category of prisoners for whom AI demands a fair and prompt trial.In AI's usage, the term includes any prisoner whose case has a significant political element: whether the motivation of the prisoner's acts, the acts in themselves, or the motivation of the authorities."Political" [...] is used by AI to refer to aspects of human relations related to [...] "politics": the mechanisms of society and civil order, the principles, organization, or conduct of government or public affairs, and the relation of all these to questions of language, ethnic origin, sex or religion, status or influence (among other factors).The category of political prisoners embraces the category of prisoners of conscience, the only prisoners who AI demands should be immediately and unconditionally released, as well as people who resort to criminal violence for a political motive.In AI's use of the term, here are some examples of political prisoners:* a person accused or convicted of an <b>ordinary</b> <b>crime</b> carried out for political motives, such as murder or robbery carried out to support the objectives of an opposition group;* a person accused or convicted of an <b>ordinary</b> <b>crime</b> committed in a political context, such as at a demonstration by a trade union or a peasants' organization;* a member or suspected member of an armed opposition group who has been charged with treason or [...] "subversion".Governments often say they have no political prisoners, only prisoners held under the normal criminal law. AI however describes cases like the examples given above as [...] "political" [...] and uses the terms [...] "political trial" [...] and [...] "political imprisonment" [...] when referring to them. But by doing so AI does not oppose the imprisonment, except where it further maintains that the prisoner is a prisoner of conscience, or condemn the trial, except where it concludes that it was unfair.|$|E

40|$|On {{the eve of}} World War II, eight {{countries}} had completely abolished {{the death penalty and}} another six had banned it for <b>ordinary</b> <b>crimes.</b> As of early 2008, 92 {{countries had}} prohibited capital punishment for all crimes and 10 more had ruled it out for <b>ordinary</b> <b>crimes.</b> The goal {{of this article is to}} account for the pattern of national abolition of the death penalty since 1960. We hypothesize that certain kinds of democracies are more liable to end capital punishment than others. Specifically, the negotiated form of democracy produced by parliamentary systems with proportional representation (consensus democracy in Lijpharts terms) is more likely to do away with the death penalty than are other forms of democracy. As previous research indicates, democratic transitions also increase the likelihood of abolition. Finally, international influences can also tip countries toward abolition. We suggest that incentives provided by international organizations, particularly in Europe, have drawn some countries toward abolition. The empirical analysis of approximately 150 countries for the period 19602005 confirms our expectations...|$|R
