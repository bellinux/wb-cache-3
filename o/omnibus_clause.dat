40|$|This dissertation’s {{second and}} third {{chapters}} are about divorce. The fourth is about utilitarianism. Each {{can be read as}} a self-contained paper. The second chapter is titled “The Evolution of Fault to No-Fault Divorce and The Contemporaneous Changes in Divorce Rates. ” I find that the statutory enactment of no-fault was not correlated with an increase in divorce rates. Instead, it was correlated with a fall in the growth rates of divorce. I review the historical facts and find that in the previous decades, the fault concept had already been thoroughly eroded. This may explain why no-fault reforms were not correlated with an increase in divorce. The third chapter is titled “Omnibus Clauses and Contemporaneous Changes in Divorce Rates, 1867 - 1906. ” I give a primer on the unusually liberal divorce laws known as <b>omnibus</b> <b>clauses.</b> I find that they were significantly correlated with divorce rates. The fourth chapter is titled “Revealed Relative Utilitarianism. ” It considers the aggregation of von Neumann-Morgenstern preferences and introduces the concept of revealed marginal rates of substitution. The main result is that the only social welfare function that satisfies a certain set of axioms that is the relative utilitarian welfare function, that is, where the social planner simply adds up all agents’ 0 - 1 normalized utility functions...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This paper {{examines}} an omnibus {{ground of}} appellate {{jurisdiction of the}} Customary Court of Appeal in Nigeria to demonstrate that this ground of jurisdiction which refers to ‘questions of customary law’ and the manner of interpretation by Nigerian courts has stifled the growth of customary law. Prior Work This work extends previous works {{on the nature of}} legal pluralism in Nigeria and how Nigerian courts interpret and develop this area of the law. Approach: Available literature as well as primary documents was used to the objectives of the study. Implications: This work is of value to academics and judges interested in the growth and development of customary law in particular and legal pluralism in Nigeria in general. Value: This paper suggests that a general <b>omnibus</b> jurisdictional <b>clause</b> should be expansively interpreted by Nigerian courts to recognise all issues concerning customary law as proper for appellate courts because this will tremendously assist the growth and development of customary law in Nigeria...|$|R

40|$|In {{the years}} after the {{promulgation}} of the 1952 official text, particularly as the New York Law Revision Commission studied it, and {{as more and more}} states either studied the Code for enactment or actually enacted it during the late 19502 ̆ 7 s and early 19602 ̆ 7 s, law professors, practicing attorneys and bank attorneys commented on each provision of it. Section 4 - 303 (1) (d) and its <b>omnibus</b> <b>clause</b> did not escape this scrutiny. Many of the commentators, however, did no more than describe the purpose of section 4 - 3032 ̆ 7 s priority rules, point out that section 4 - 213 (1) (c), a remarkably similar section in the Code, did not contain the <b>omnibus</b> <b>clause,</b> and then note the purpose of the <b>omnibus</b> <b>clause</b> as explained in official comment. Other commentators noted that the interplay between section 4 - 213 (1) (c) 2 ̆ 7 s completion of the process of posting and the <b>omnibus</b> <b>clause</b> of section 4 - 303 (1) (d) left a period of time or 2 ̆ 2 gap 2 ̆ 2 during which the responsibility of the payor bank was not clearly defined...|$|E
