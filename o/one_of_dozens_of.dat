500|$|Belgian {{resistance}} {{to the treatment of}} Jews crystallised between August–September 1942, following the passing of legislation regarding wearing yellow badges and the start of the deportations.

2500|$|On 25 November, {{shares on}} Egypt's stock market plunged almost 10%.

The Muslim Brotherhood's party offices in Damanhour, Alexandria, Mansoura, Suez and Cairo were ransacked and damaged {{in the wake of the}} 22 November constitutional declaration.
