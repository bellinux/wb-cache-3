5|$|Historian Lowell H. Harrison called Stanley's {{administration}} {{the apex}} of the Progressive Era in Kentucky. The most significant legislation passed during the 1916 legislative session were a state antitrust law and a ban on railroads <b>offering</b> <b>free</b> passes to public figures. A Corrupt Practices Act required candidates for office to file reports of their expenses, limited the amount of allowable expenses, and forbade public service corporations from contributing to any campaign. Other accomplishments included initiating the state's first budget program, enacting its first workman's compensation law, and instituting a convict labor law. The one progressive measure that did not pass, a bill granting women's suffrage, failed in the House by a single vote.|$|E

5|$|The poor demand {{resulted}} in price cuts for various Windows RT products; in April 2013 {{the price of}} Dell's XPS 10 fell from US$450 US to $300, and Microsoft began <b>offering</b> <b>free</b> covers for its Surface tablet in some territories as a limited-time promotion—itself a US$130 value for the Type Cover alone. Microsoft also reportedly reduced the cost of Windows RT licenses for devices with smaller screens, hoping that this could spur interest in the platform. In July 2013, Microsoft cut {{the price of the}} first-generation Surface worldwide by 30%, with its U.S. price falling to $350.
