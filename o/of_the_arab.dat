5|$|The {{population}} is heterogeneous. Israeli Jews comprise some 82% of the population, almost 14% are Christians (the {{majority of whom}} are Arab Christians) and, some 4% are Muslims (of which many are Ahmadis). Haifa also includes Druze and Bahá'í communities. In 2006, 27% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> population was aged 14 and under, compared to 17% of the Jewish and other population groups. The trend continues in the age 15-29 group, in which 27% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> {{population is}} found, and the age 30-44 group (23%). The population of Jews and others in these age groups are 22% and 18% respectively. Nineteen percent of the city's Jewish and other population is between 45 and 59, compared to 14% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> population. This continues with 14% of Jews and others aged 60–74 and 10% over age 75, in comparison to 7% and just 2% respectively in the Arab population.|$|E
5|$|According to Oan Ali Mohammed, {{suppression}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> sovereignty {{movement was}} the spark {{that led to}} his desire to attack the Iranian Embassy in London.

5|$|Despite his {{popularity}} {{with the people}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> world, by mid-1957 his only regional ally was Syria. In September, Turkish troops massed along the Syrian border, giving credence to rumors that the Baghdad Pact countries were attempting to topple Syria's leftist government. Nasser sent a contingent force to Syria as a symbolic display of solidarity, further elevating his prestige in the Arab world, and particularly among Syrians.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, Houston had a {{population}} boom as {{people from the}} Rust Belt states moved to Texas in large numbers.

5|$|Eusebius' {{understanding}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> peoples {{is informed}} by his reading of the Bible and {{his knowledge of the}} history of imperial Rome. He {{does not appear to have}} personally known any Arabs. In his Chronicon, all the Arabs that appear—save for one reference to Ishmael—figure in the political history of the first three centuries of the Christian era. To Eusebius, the Saracens of the 4th century are direct-line descendants of the biblical Ishmaelites, descendants of the handmaid, Hagar, and the patriarch, Abraham. They are thus outcasts, beyond God's Covenant with the favored son of Abraham, Isaac. The twin images of the Ishmaelite and the Saracen—outcasts and latrones, raiders of the frontiers—reinforce each other and give Eusebius' portrait <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> nation an unhappy color. He may have been reluctant to associate the first Christian emperor with a people of such unfortunate ancestry.|$|E

In an effort at reconciliation, TFG and ICU representatives held several rounds of talks in Khartoum under the auspices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> League.

5|$|At {{a session}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> League's Joint Defence Council on January 27–30, 1973, Egypt {{presented}} a report stressing that {{an attack against}} Israel {{would have to be}} carried out simultaneously from Egypt, Syria and Jordan because of the Israeli air superiority. According to the report, Egypt and Syria's air forces, if reinforced with 16 air squadrons from other Arab countries would achieve numerical superiority. However, the Israelis offset this by superior training, avionics, aircraft payload and weaponry. A simultaneous Arab attack could dilute the effectiveness of the Israeli Air Force (IAF), and would force Israeli ground forces to fight a two-front war.|$|E
