40|$|The {{geographic}} {{range of the}} freshwater naiad Margaritifera auricularia has declined alarmingly {{since the beginning of}} the 20 th century. The last records of live specimens date from 1933, and this species was thought to be extinct until 1996 when the authors found a population of about 2000 mussels in a channel of the Ebro River basin (Spain). The habitat, biology and host fish of the species are here described for the first time. The habitat is a well oxygenated, subsaline and <b>oligo-mesotrophic</b> <b>water</b> with high values of calcium (150 mg/l) where M. auricularia shows a patchy distribution in a substrate of pebbles, gravels and sand. In aquarium experiments all individuals released glochidia and developing embryos during 35 days (February-March), the former becoming attached to the gill filaments of the sturgeon (Accipenser baeri) 1 day after emission. One month later, at a temperature of 16 - 20 oC, metamorphosed juveniles were obtained from induced infestations on the sturgeons. We review the current situation of this population and measures that should be urgently implemented to conserve this species through conservation of the habitat (Canal Imperial de Aragon) and long term programmes of artificial propagation.

40|$|Some {{cyanobacteria}} genera {{are able}} to produce potent toxins, including hepatotoxins (microcystins, nodularins), neurotoxins (saxitoxins, anatoxins, BMAA), and cytotoxins (cylindrospermopsins). In the last decades, reports of cyanobacteria blooms have constantly increased worldwide and therefore {{the assessment of the}} toxic potential associated to those blooms has become a growing concern, considered the relevant negative impact of the presence of toxins on water quality and human health. Ongoing climate changes are mentioned among the factors favouring the occurrence of toxic blooms. In order to investigate the toxic potential of cyanobacteria in <b>oligo-mesotrophic</b> <b>water</b> basins, we have conducted a systematic survey in Lake Garda. Planktothrix rubescens and Dolichospermum lemmermannii are the most frequent potential toxic species in the lake. A monthly sampling campaign was conducted from 2009 till 2012; the molecular diversity of toxins was determined by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) techniques. Samples were screened for 14 microcystin variants, 3 anatoxins, and 3 cylindrospermopsins. Results show that the most abundant toxin was always the MC-RRdm, which is 4 times less potent than the most toxic MC-LR (LD 50 in mice are 12 and 50 μg kg- 1, respectively). Other four microcystin variants, MC-YR, LR, LRdm, and RR, were present but in very low amounts. Although the total microcystin concentration was always well below the safe level for humans (defined by the World Health Organization in 1 µg/l), microcystins were constantly present in all seasons with peaks in the summer months, in coincidence with the metalimnetic development of Planktothrix populations...|$|E

40|$|Synura petersenii {{represents}} {{a complex of}} pseudo-cryptic species. These are planktonic colonial organisms belonging to the class Chrysophyceae. The species are abundant in spring and autumn, when they produce golden-brown blooms in <b>oligo-mesotrophic</b> <b>waters.</b> In this thesis, I focused on investigating the effect of temperature to growth parameters of four selected species: S. petersenii, S. americana, S. glabra and S. conopea. Several temperature experiments were performed and statistically analyzed. According to growth curves the temperature 25 žC was mostly stressful for these organisms. Only S. petersenii sensu stricto was sometimes able to growth at this temperature. In general, the significant differences in growth rates were detected between S. petersenii and S. americana. In all experiments, S. petersenii had the lowest growth rate. This ubiquitous species probably acts as a K-strategist. S. americana grew generally very quickly, especially at temperature 13 žC that is obviously optimal for it. Further, I observed a significant strain specificity, which is largely a well-known phenomenon in the ecophysiology. Significant differences in growth rates were noted between temperatures 13 žC and 16 žC, where all tested species grew best, as well. This is in accordance with a general recognition of [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Lake Vrana is {{a natural}} {{oligotrophic}} lake situated {{on the island of}} Cres (northeastern Adriatic Sea). Its macrophytic flora and vegetation were studied in 2010, nearly 50 years after the first comprehensive research on it. Vegetation of vascular plants, including belts of helophytes and submersed vegetation, dominates in the shallowest water. Charophytic vegetation starts to develop at the depth of approximately 8 m and is present in three clear zones dominated by Chara aculeolata, Ch. virgata and Nitella opaca, reaching a final depth of 30 m. The lake and its vegetation belong to habitat type 3140 (hard <b>oligo-mesotrophic</b> <b>waters</b> with benthic vegetation of Chara species), protected by the Habitat Directive. Due to the presence of several charophyte species endangered in the Balkans and Europe, the lake is an important site for the conservation of charophytes at the national and European levels. Great changes in the water regime over the last decades due to increase of water temperature and overexploitation of the lake’s water are exerting a strong negative effect on this protected special reserve. A future comprehensive monitoring program, including climatological observation and surveillance of introduced alien fish populations, should focus on determining the cause of the observed retreat of vegetation in the lake...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{long-term}} (1964 - 2011) research, we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} zooplankton community has a highly indicative value in assessing the ecosystem and trophic state of water bodies. Basing on the results of our study and taking into account relevant data from numerous zooplankton studies, we can conclude that the zooplankton measures deserving to be used as indicators in the monitoring of Lake Võrtsjärv (and other similar eutrophic water bodies) could be the following: i) indicatory species of eutrophic waters [Anuraeopsis fissa (Gosse), Keratella tecta (Gosse), Trichocerca rousseleti (Voigt), Chydorus sphaericus (O. F. Müller), Bosmina longirostris (O. F. Müller) ]; ii) indicatory species of <b>oligo-mesotrophic</b> <b>waters</b> [Conochilus unicornis Rousselet, Kellicottia longispina (Kellicott), Ploesoma hudsoni (Imhof), Bosmina berolinensis Imhof, Eudiaptomus gracilis (Sars) ]; iii) number and diversity of species; iv) mean zooplankter weight, mean cladoceran weight, mean rotifer weight and mean copepod weight; v) rotifer abundance; vi) the share (%) of rotifers in total zooplankton abundance; vii) the ratio of abundance of large cladocerans to abundance of all cladocerans (N LargeClad /N Clad); viii) the ratio of calanoid copepod abundance to cyclopoid copepod abundance (N Cal /N Cycl); ix) the ratio of crustacean abundance to rotifer abundance (N Crust /N Rot).

40|$|Phytoplankton {{succession}} was studied weekly {{based on}} integrated {{samples from the}} euphotic zone (0 - 25 m) of the deep oligotrophic Lake Stechlin (Germany, Brandenburg) between 1994 - 1999. The rare centric diatom Stephanocostis chantaicus appeared regularly int he winter plankton building up population maximum int he winter of 1995 / 1996 when long-lasting ice, partly with snow, covered the lake. The paper describes morphological features of the Lake Stechlin population of St. chantaicus, its population dynamics and growth conditions. The morphological analysis indicates that by giving less taxonomic importance to rib formation {{and the development of}} a ring along the margin of the valves, and instead, giving more weight to similarities with the generic features of Cyclostephanos, it would worth to consider to include stephanocostis chantaicus into the genus Cyclostephanos. Concerning ecophysiology of the species it is supposed that underice convection currents driven by solar heating are essential pattern of population to remain in suspension and this explains the highly variable interannual pattern of population size and sexual reproduction (with maximum frequency of auxospores and initial cells of 0, 94 %) which were observed only int he winter of 1995 / 1996. An analysis of the known localities for stephanocostis chantaicus indicates that the species has a north circumpolar distribution and its occurence is predictable in large, deep, <b>oligo-mesotrophic</b> <b>waters</b> with high transparency, neutral or slightly alkaline pH and Ca(2 +) concentrations of 6 - 46 mg 1 (- 1). In such lakest he species is probably more widely distributed than indicated by floristic records...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{that the combination of}} the flocculent polyaluminium chloride (PAC) with the lanthanum-modified bentonite Phoslock® (Flock & Lock) could sink effectively a water bloom of cyanobacteria and could shift a turbid, cyanobacteria infested lake to a clear water lake was tested in a controlled laboratory experiment and a whole lake experiment. In the laboratory, a relatively low dose of the flocculent PAC (2. 2 and 4. 4 mg Al l- 1) was insufficient to sediment positively buoyant cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa). Similarly, the lanthanum modified clay (dosed at 390 mg l- 1) was insufficient to sediment the positively buoyant cyanobacteria. However, the combination of PAC and Phoslock® effectively sedimented cyanobacteria flocks. Likewise, a combined treatment of 2 tons PAC and 18 tons Phoslock® in Lake Rauwbraken in April 2008 effectively sedimented a developing cyanobacteria bloom of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. The average chlorophyll-a concentration in the two years prior to this Flock & Lock treatment was 19. 5 (± 36. 5) µg l- 1, while it was as low as 3. 7 (± 4. 5) µg l- 1 in the years following the treatment. The combined treatment effectively reduced the amount of total phosphorus (TP) in the water column from on average 169 (± 126) µg P l- 1 before the application to 14 (± 15) µg P l- 1 after the treatment. Based on mean summer chlorophyll-a and TP concentrations, the lake was shifted from a eutrophic/hypertrophic state to an oligo/mesotrophic state. From directly after treatment in April 2008 until and including 2013, Lake Rauwbraken remained in an <b>oligo-mesotrophic</b> clear <b>water</b> state with TP reduced to less than 10 % of the pre-treatment. This result shows that eutrophication in relatively small, isolated, stratifying lakes can be restored by targeting both water column and sediment P using a combination of flocculent and solid phase P-sorben...|$|R
40|$|Das saisonale Auftreten von erdig/modrigen Geruchsstoffen beeinträchtigt die organoleptische Qualität von Trinkwasser aus Talsperren weltweit. Grund für diese Beeinträchtigungen sind biogene Geruchsstoffe, die in oligo- bis mesotrophen Trinkwassertalsperren vorwiegend von benthischen Cyanobakterien freigesetzt werden. Als wichtigste Vertreter der biogenen Geruchsstoffe in den untersuchten sächsischen Trinkwassertalsperren wurden Geosmin und 2 -Methylisoborneol (2 -MIB) identifiziert, die bereits in Konzentrationen von wenigen ng/L organoleptisch wahrgenommen werden. Zur Entfernung der Geruchsstoffe während der Trinkwasseraufbereitung wird meist die Adsorption an Pulveraktivkohle als zusätzlicher Aufbereitungsschritt eingesetzt. In natürlichen Wässern wird die Adsorptionskapazität vor allem durch die direkte Konkurrenz niedermolekularer, gut adsorbierbarer Fraktionen des organischen Hintergrundes reduziert. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass die Adsorption mit verschiedenen Modellansätzen für die Gemischadsorption von Spurenstoffen und organischem Hintergrund beschrieben werden kann. Diese Modelle, die für Gleichgewichtszustände entwickelt wurden, können auch angewendet werden, wenn sich das Adsorptionsgleichgewicht noch nicht eingestellt hat, wie es oftmals bei den in der Praxis realisierten Kontaktzeiten der Fall ist. Bei Auswahl einer Aktivkohle mit guter Entfernungsleistung für die Geruchsstoffe liegen die Kosten für die benötigte Aktivkohlemenge zur Reduzierung der Geruchsstoffkonzentration um 90 % bei 0, 009 - 0, 05 €/m³. Der Einsatz UV-basierter erweiterter Oxidationsverfahren, wie UV/O 3, UV/H 2 O 2, Vakuum-UV (VUV) sowie VUV/O 3, stellt eine Alternative für die Entfernung von Geosmin und 2 -MIB dar. Die eingehende Untersuchung dieser Verfahren zeigte, dass die indirekte Oxidation durch gebildete Hydroxylradikale zu einer effektiven Umsetzung der Geruchsstoffe und zahlreicher weiterer Spurenstoffe führt. Zusätzlich wird das Rohwasser aufgrund der keimtötenden Wirkung von UV-Strahlung (und Ozon) gleichzeitig desinfiziert. Allerdings sind bei den Verfahren UV/O 3 und UV/H 2 O 2 für einen kosteneffizienten Geruchsstoffabbau hohe Oxidationsmittelkonzentrationen notwendig, die zu unerwünschten Nebenprodukten oder Residuen führen können. Die VUV-Bestrahlung stand besonders im Fokus der Untersuchungen, da dieser Wellenlängenbereich sowohl zur photoinitiierten Oxidation von Spurenstoffen als auch zur Generierung von Ozon in der Gasphase eingesetzt werden kann. Ozongenerierung und Bestrahlung (im UV- oder VUV-Bereich) wurden in einem speziellen UV-Reaktor mit nur einer Strahlungsquelle realisiert. Mit diesem innovativen UV-System mit interner Ozongenerierung konnte eine Reduzierung der Geosminkonzentration um 90 % mit einem Energieverbrauch unter 1 kWh/m³ und Energiekosten unter 0, 09 €/m³ erreicht werden. Außerdem wird Nitrit, das durch VUV-Bestrahlung gebildet wird, durch die Zugabe des intern erzeugten Ozons oxidiert. Unter den untersuchten UV-basierten Verfahren ist die Kombination VUV/O 3 mit interner Ozongenerierung für die Entfernung von saisonal auftretenden Geruchsstoffen in der Trinkwasseraufbereitung aus Talsperrenwässern am besten geeignet. Die Verfahrenskombination zeichnet sich durch ein geringes Risiko hinsichtlich der Bildung unerwünschter Nebenprodukte, den Verzicht auf den Einsatz von Chemikalien und die Vermeidung von Rückständen sowie einen vergleichsweise geringen Energieverbrauch und Wartungsaufwand aus. The {{seasonal}} {{occurrence of}} earthy/musty odours affects the organoleptic quality {{of drinking water}} from reservoirs worldwide. In <b>oligo-mesotrophic</b> drinking <b>water</b> reservoirs this impairment is mainly caused by biogenic odour compounds released by benthic cyanobacteria. The most important odour compounds in the investigated Saxon drinking water reservoirs were geosmin und 2 -methylisoborneol (2 -MIB), which exhibit a threshold odour concentration of several ng/L. The application of powdered activated carbon is widely used {{for the removal of}} odour compounds during drinking water treatment. However, the adsorption capacity in natural waters is reduced due to the competition of well adsorbable, low molecular weight organic compounds. It could be shown that the adsorption process can be described with various model approaches for the competitive adsorption of micropollutants in presence of natural organic matter. These model approaches, which were developed for equilibrium adsorption, can be applied for the non-equilibrium adsorption as well, for example for contact times realized in the waterworks. If an activated carbon with a high adsorption capacity for odour compounds is applied, the costs for the amount of activated carbon necessary to reduce the odour concentration by one order of magnitude are about 0. 009 - 0. 05 €/m³. UV-based advanced oxidation processes like UV/O 3, UV/H 2 O 2, Vacuum-UV (VUV) and VUV/O 3 are an alternative for the removal of geosmin and 2 -MIB. Thus, these processes were investigated in detail showing that an effective elimination of the odour compounds and other micropollutants is achieved via indirect oxidation by formed hydroxyl radicals. Additionally, the raw water is disinfected by the germicidal effect of UV irradiation (and ozone). However, for a cost efficient degradation of odour compounds by UV/O 3 or UV/H 2 O 2 high oxidant concentrations are necessary, which lead to the formation of undesired by-products and residuals. The focus of the presented doctoral thesis was on the treatment with VUV irradiation because this wavelength range can be applied for photoinitiated oxidation {{as well as for the}} generation of ozone in the gas phase. Ozone generation and irradiation (in the UV or VUV range) can be combined in a specific UV reactor using a single irradiation source. Using this innovative UV system with internal ozone generation the reduction of the concentration of geosmin by one order of magnitude can be achieved with an energy consumption below 1 kWh/m³ and operational costs below 0. 09 €/m³. Furthermore, the addition of ozone leads to a noticeable oxidation of nitrite, which is formed under VUV irradiation. Within the investigated UV based processes, the combination VUV/O 3 with internal ozone generation is the most suitable for the removal of seasonally occurring odour compounds during drinking water treatment from reservoir water. The process is characterized by the minimization of the risk for the formation of undesired by-products without the application of chemicals, the reduction of the formation of residues as well as low energy consumption and maintenance requirements...|$|R
