5|$|Static {{equilibrium}} {{was understood}} {{well before the}} invention of classical mechanics. <b>Objects</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> at rest have zero net force acting on them.|$|E
5|$|A graph {{is formed}} by a {{collection}} of vertices and edges, where the vertices are structureless <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> connected in pairs by edges. In {{the case of a}} directed graph, each edge has an orientation, from one vertex to another vertex.|$|E
5|$|Further, birds {{recall and}} avoid <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> both {{conspicuous}} and foul-tasting longer than <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> equally foul-tasting but cryptically coloured. This suggests that Wallace's original view, that warning colouration helped to teach predators to avoid prey thus coloured, was correct. However, some birds (inexperienced starlings and domestic chicks) also innately avoid conspicuously coloured objects, as demonstrated using mealworms painted yellow and black to resemble wasps, with dull green controls. This implies that warning coloration works {{at least in}} part by stimulating the evolution of predators to encode the meaning of the warning signal, rather than by requiring each new generation to learn the signal's meaning.|$|E
50|$|Light from {{an object}} with a {{substantial}} relative radial velocity at emission {{will be subject}} to the Doppler effect, so the frequency of the light decreases for <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> receding (redshift) and increases for <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> approaching (blueshift).|$|R
50|$|Under certain conditions, it <b>is</b> {{possible}} <b>that</b> {{a variable}} of a parameterized type {{refers to an}} <b>object</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not of <b>that</b> parameterized type. The variable will always refer to an <b>object</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> an instance of a class that implements the parameterized type.|$|R
50|$|The {{first stage}} is the mark stage which does a tree {{traversal}} {{of the entire}} 'root set' and marks each <b>object</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> pointed to by a root as being 'in-use'. All <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> those <b>objects</b> point to, and so on, are marked as well, so <b>that</b> every <b>object</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> reachable via the root set is marked.|$|R
5|$|Another key {{aspect of}} SIM Lite's mission was {{determining}} {{the upper and}} lower limits of star's masses. Today, scientists understand that there are limits to the how small or large a star can be. <b>Objects</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> too small lack the internal pressure to initiate thermonuclear fusion, which is what causes a star to shine. These objects are known as brown dwarfs and represent {{the lower end of the}} stellar mass scale. Stars that are too large become unstable and explode in a supernova.|$|E
5|$|This metric {{contains}} a scale factor, which {{describes how the}} size of the universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a coordinate system to be made, called comoving coordinates. In this coordinate system, the grid expands along with the universe, and <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> moving only because of the expansion of the universe, remain at fixed points on the grid. While their coordinate distance (comoving distance) remains constant, the physical distance between two such co-moving points expands proportionally with the scale factor of the universe.|$|E
5|$|Each {{enemy was}} {{designed}} to exhibit a unique behavior toward the character; random elements were programmed into the enemies' behaviors to make the game more interesting. The first two designed were the simplest: Electrodes and Grunts. Electrodes are stationary <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> lethal to the in-game characters, and Grunts are simple robots that chase the protagonist by plotting the shortest path to him. Grunts were designed to overwhelm the player with large groups. While testing the game with the new control system and the two enemies, Jarvis and DeMar were impressed by the gameplay's excitement and fun. As a result, they began steadily {{increasing the number of}} on-screen enemies to over a hundred to see if more enemies would generate more enjoyment.|$|E

Goat is an animate object.Here similarly, the prefix ga- on the verb -walas marks for third person singular <b>object,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> for yivar, 'dog'. Dog is an animate object.|$|R

5|$|Infrared {{astronomy}} {{is founded}} on the detection and analysis of infrared radiation, wavelengths longer than red light and outside the range of our vision. The infrared spectrum is useful for studying <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> too cold to radiate visible light, such as planets, circumstellar disks or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust. The longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of young stars embedded in molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies. Observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous Galactic protostars and their host star clusters.|$|E
5|$|Saint Augustine {{offered a}} version of divine command theory that began by casting ethics as {{the pursuit of the}} supreme good, which {{delivers}} human happiness. He argued that to achieve this happiness, humans must love <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> worthy of human love in the correct manner; this requires humans to love God, which then allows them to correctly love that which is worthy of being loved. Augustine's ethics proposed that the act of loving God enables humans to properly orient their loves, leading to human happiness and fulfilment. Augustine supported Plato's view that a well-ordered soul is a desirable consequence of morality. However, unlike Plato, he believed that achieving a well-ordered soul had a higher purpose: living in accordance with God's commands. His view of morality was thus heteronomous, as he believed in deference to a higher authority (God), rather than acting autonomously.|$|E
5|$|Chimpanzees {{are capable}} of {{actively}} locating <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> the focus of another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others. They {{are not limited to}} following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view. They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze. Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age. By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn. There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses. By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees do not look back to the experimenter after looking at the target. Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees. Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.|$|E
50|$|By {{understanding}} the interrelationships of these qualities, {{much can be}} perceived {{about the nature of}} an object or multiple objects. For example, an <b>object</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> tall and narrow may be recognized quickly as a pole. An <b>object</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> tall and narrow near the bottom while broad near the top would be a tree. Something <b>that</b> <b>is</b> tall and very broad registers as a wall or building. Something <b>that</b> <b>is</b> broad and tall in the middle, while being shorter at either end may be identified as a parked car. An <b>object</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> low and broad may be a planter, retaining wall, or curb. And finally, something that starts out close and very low but recedes into the distance as it gets higher is a set of steps. Density refers to the solidity of the object (solid/sparse, hard/soft). Awareness of density adds richness and complexity to one's available information. For instance, an <b>object</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> low and solid may be recognized as a table, while something low and sparse sounds like a bush; but an <b>object</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> tall and broad and very sparse is probably a fence.|$|R
5000|$|Relativistic Doppler effect, where {{light that}} bounces on an <b>object</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{moving in a}} very high speed will get its {{wavelength}} changed; if the light bounces at an <b>object</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> moving towards it, the impact will compress the photons, so the wavelength will become shorter and the light will be blueshifted and the photons will be packed more closely so the photon flux will be increased; if it bounces at an <b>object</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> moving away from it, it will be redshifted and the photons will be packed more sparsely so the photon flux will be decreased.|$|R

5|$|Deciding between {{building}} ground- versus space-based telescopes is complex. Even before Hubble was launched, specialized ground-based {{techniques such}} as aperture masking interferometry had obtained higher-resolution optical and infrared images than Hubble would achieve, though restricted to targets about 108 times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble. Since then, advances in adaptive optics have extended the high-resolution imaging capabilities of ground-based telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects. The usefulness of adaptive optics versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of the research questions being asked. In the visible bands, adaptive optics can only correct a relatively small field of view, whereas HST can conduct high-resolution optical imaging over a wide field. Only {{a small fraction of}} astronomical objects are accessible to high-resolution ground-based imaging; in contrast Hubble can perform high-resolution observations of any part of the night sky, and on <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> extremely faint.|$|E
5|$|Levels {{become more}} complex as the player progresses, {{introducing}} different mechanics and {{new types of}} enemies. Each enemy type {{is dressed in a}} unique colour, allowing the player to recognise their movement patterns. Some enemies remain static or rotate on a single node, while others will patrol the board along a specific route. Later stages may require the player to collect keys located on the board and unlock doors that block access to the level objective. Trapdoors connect one location on the board to another and allow the player to move between them during a turn. Some nodes contain potted plants, the player will not be detected while occupying these nodes. Coloured disguises can be found and equipped to let the player walk past an enemy type of that colour without being detected. There are throwable <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> used to disrupt and change enemy behaviour patterns. Firearms can also be found on certain levels, they are used to shoot targets or obstacles from a distance.|$|E
5|$|Symbols are visuals used to {{represent}} objects, actions, and concepts {{through the use of}} items such as the physical object itself, colored or black and white photographs, line drawings, and written words. For users with literacy skills, alphabet-based symbols including individual letters, whole words, or parts thereof may be used in combination with the other types of symbols.Tactile symbols which are textured objects, real objects or parts of real <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> used as a communication symbols particularly for individuals with visual impairments and/or significant intellectual impairments. Both low- and high-tech devices can incorporate the use of symbols. With low-tech devices, a communication partner is involved and must interpret the symbols chosen. Picture Communication Exchange System (PECS) is a commonly used low-tech communication system that teach individuals how to request, comment, and answer questions through the use of line drawings known as picture communication symbols (PCS). , a high-tech communication system, is an app that incorporates various symbols and motor planning. Symbols are placed in fixed position on the screen which allow users to develop motor patterns associated with certain requests or statements. The choice of symbols and aspects of their presentation, such as size and background, depend on an individual's preferences as well as their linguistic, visual, and cognitive skills. This can be determined using an assessment for symbolic understanding.|$|E
