The green circles show the isoradial constraint on both theoriginal and dual lattices. The yellow polygons highlight the three types of polygons on the lattice, and the pink polygons highlight the twotypes of polygons on the dual lattice. The lattice has vertex types (1/2)(33,42) + (1/2)(3,4,6,4), whilethe dual lattice has vertex types (1/15)(46)+(6/15)(42,52)+(2/15)(53)+(6/15)(52,4). The critical point is where the longerbonds (on both the lattice and dual lattice) have <b>occupation</b> <b>probability</b> p = 2 sin (π/18) = 0.347296... which is the bond percolation threshold on a triangular lattice, and the shorter bonds have <b>occupation</b> <b>probability</b> 1 - 2 sin(π/18) = 0.652703..., which is the bond percolation on a hexagonal lattice. These results follow from the isoradial condition [...] but also follow from applying the star-triangle transformation to certain stars on the honeycomb lattice. Finally, it can be generalized to having three different probabilities in the three different directions, p1, p2 and p3 for the long bonds, and 1 - p1, 1 - p2, and 1 - p3 for the short bonds, where p1, p2 and p3 satisfy the critical surface for the inhomogeneous triangular lattice.|$|E

5000|$|Percolation {{threshold}} is {{a mathematical}} concept related to percolation theory, {{which is the}} formation of long-range connectivity in random systems. Below the threshold a giant connected component does not exist; while above it, there exists a giant component {{of the order of}} system size. In engineering and coffee making, percolation represents the flow of fluids through porous media, but in the mathematics and physics worlds it generally refers to simplified lattice models of random systems or networks (graphs), {{and the nature of the}} connectivity in them. The percolation threshold is the critical value of the <b>occupation</b> <b>probability</b> p, or more generally a critical surface for a group of parameters p1, p2, ..., such that infinite connectivity (percolation) first occurs.|$|E

BTE considers particle states in terms of position and momentum vectors (x, p) and this is represented as the sate <b>occupation</b> <b>probability.</b> The occupation has equilibrium distributions (the known boson, fermion, and Maxwell-Boltzmann particles) and transport of energy (heat) is due to nonequilibrium (cause by a driving force or potential). Central to the transport is the role of scattering which turn the distribution toward equilibrium). The scattering is presented by the relations time or the mean free path. The relaxation time (or its inverse which is the interaction rate) is found from other calculations (ab initio or MD) or empirically. BTE can be numerically solved with Monte Carlo method, etc.|$|E

3000|$|In [10], the {{stochastic}} approximation {{method is}} introduced {{to solve the}} problem of the form (8). The basic idea is to generate a sequence of the estimates of the optimal antenna subset where the new estimate is based on the previous one by moving a small step in a good direction towards the global optimizer. Through the iterations, the global optimizer can be found by means of maintaining an <b>occupation</b> <b>probability</b> vector π, which indicates an estimate of the <b>occupation</b> <b>probability</b> of one state (i.e., antenna subset). Under certain conditions, such an algorithm converges to the state that has the largest <b>occupation</b> <b>probability</b> in π.

This {{is due to the}} fact that the excitation probability shows better statistics than the <b>occupation</b> <b>probability.</b> In addition, our simulations show that the excitation probability does not depend on the choice of the chemical potential, which critically affects the <b>occupation</b> <b>probability.</b> Our results allow us to propose the excitation probability as a standard procedure to determine the effective temperature in Coulomb glasses as well as in other complex systems such as spin glasses...|$|E

40|$|Giant neutron halos in medium-heavy nuclei are {{studied in}} the {{framework}} of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approach with Skyrme interactions. The appearance of such structures depends sensitively on the effective interaction adopted. This is illustrated by comparing the predictions of SLy 4 and SkI 4 in the Ca and Zr isotopic chains. The former force gives no halo effect, the latter predicts a neutron halo in the Zr chain with A> 122 due to the weakly bound orbitals 3 p 1 / 2 and 3 p 3 / 2. The structure of the halo is analyzed in terms of the <b>occupation</b> <b>probabilities</b> of these orbitals and their partial contributions to the neutron density.

40|$|Dynamics {{of large}} complex systems, such as {{relaxation}} towards equilibrium in classical statistical mechanics, often obeys a master equation. The equation significantly simplifies the complexities but describes essential information of <b>occupation</b> <b>probabilities.</b> A related fundamental {{question is the}} thermalization, a coherent evolution of an isolated many-body quantum state into a state {{that seems to be}} in thermal equilibrium. It is valuable to find an effective equation describing this complex dynamics. Here, we experimentally investigate the question by observing sudden quench dynamics of quantum Ising-like models implemented in our quantum simulator, defect-free single-atom tweezers in conjunction with Rydberg atom interaction. We find that saturation of local observables, a thermalization signature, obeys a master equation experimentally constructed by time-resolved monitoring the <b>occupation</b> <b>probabilities</b> of prequench states and imposing the principle of the detailed balance.

40|$|We {{discuss a}} {{nonlinear}} model for relaxation by energy redistribution within an isolated, closed system composed of noninteracting identical particles with N energy levels. The time-dependent <b>occupation</b> <b>probabilities</b> {{are assumed to}} obey a novel set of nonlinear rate equations that maintain invariant the mean energy and the normalization condition. The entropy is a nondecreasing function of time until the initially nonzero <b>occupation</b> <b>probabilities</b> reach a Boltzmann-like canonical distribution over the occupied energy eigenstates. Initially zero <b>occupation</b> <b>probabilities,</b> instead, remain zero at all times. The solutions of the rate equations are unique and well defined for arbitrary initial conditions and for all times. The existence and uniqueness both forward and backward in time allows {{the reconstruction of the}} ancestral or primordial lowest entropy state. By casting the rate equations in terms not of the probabilities but of their positive square roots, they unfold from the assumption that time evolution is at all times along the local direction of steepest entropy ascent or, equivalently, of maximal entropy generation. These rate equations have the same mathematical structure and basic features as the nonlinear dynamical equation proposed in a series of papers ending with G. P. Beretta, Found. Phys. 17, 365 (1987) and recently rediscovered by S. Gheorghiu-Svirschevski, Phys. Rev. A 63, 022105 (2001); 63, 054102 (2001). Numerical results illustrate the features of the dynamics and the differences from the rate equations recently considered for the same problem by M. Lemanska and Z. Jaeger, Physica D 170, 72 (2002).
