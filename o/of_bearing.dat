5|$|Reducing {{friction}} {{is vital}} for minimizing wear on mechanical components and preventing overheating. As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases. Various types <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> and/or lubricant {{may be used to}} reduce friction at the interface between two components. In biological joints such as the human knee, friction is reduced by means of cartilage with a very low friction coefficient, as well as lubricating synovial fluid, which has very low viscosity. Gerhard Scholtz of Humboldt University of Berlin asserts that a similar secreted lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.|$|E

Experimental degradation data provided by the University of Cincinnati is used to validate the proposed approach. A comparative study between the neo-fuzzy neuron and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system is carried out to appraise their prediction capabilities.

25|$|In most {{multicellular}} sexual species, {{the population}} {{consists of two}} sexes, only {{one of which is}} capable <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> young (with the exception of simultaneous hermaphrodites). In an asexual species, each member of the population is capable <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> young. This implies that an asexual population has an intrinsic capacity to grow more rapidly with each generation. The cost was first described in mathematical terms by John Maynard Smith. He imagined an asexual mutant arising in a sexual population, half of which comprises males that cannot themselves produce offspring. With female-only offspring, the asexual lineage doubles its representation in the population each generation, all else being equal. Technically this is not a problem of sex but a problem of some multicellular sexually reproducing organisms. There are numerous isogamous species which are sexual and do not have the problem of producing individuals which cannot directly replicate themselves. The principal costs of sex is that males and females must search for each other in order to mate, and sexual selection often favours traits that reduce the survival of individuals.|$|E
