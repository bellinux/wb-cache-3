500|$|... "Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. IGN reviewer Cindy White commented: [...] "This episode {{proved that the}} show can be funny without him (Steve Carell)". She also praised Rainn Wilson and John Krasinski's performance in the episode calling it [...] "one of my favorite dynamics on the show". However, she criticized the Andy-Gabe-Erin love triangle storyline, commenting: [...] "It's only been made worse by the way they've turned Gabe from meek, bumbling burocrat [...] into unhinged stalker guy." [...] She ultimately gave the episode an 8.0/10. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the episode [...] "fun" [...] and a [...] "drastic improvement from 'The Inner Circle. He mainly praised the return of [...] "The Dwight/Jim dynamic", writing that he [...] "briefly rethought the idea of Dwight as long-term boss", {{and went on to}} praise the writers for featuring Dwight as manager for only one episode. He ultimately concluded that [...] "the first real impression of the show after Michael was a strong one." [...] TV Squad writer Joel Keller was very positive towards the episode commenting that [...] "The story also gave me faith that Lieberstein and company might actually do a credible job of exploring the <b>other</b> <b>folks</b> in the office now that the show's dominant force, Michael, is gone".|$|E
500|$|In June, Romney {{said that}} he would not vote for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton either, saying: [...] "It's a matter of {{personal}} conscience. I can’t vote for either of those two people." [...] He suggested that he may vote for a third-party candidate, or write-in his wife's name, saying she would be [...] "an ideal president". When pressed on who of Trump and Clinton was more qualified to be President, Romney quoted P. J. O'Rourke: [...] "Hillary Clinton is wrong on every issue, but she's wrong within the normal parameters." [...] He considered voting for the Libertarian ticket of former Republican Governors Gary Johnson and William Weld, saying that he would [...] "get to know Gary Johnson better and see if he's someone who I could end up voting for", adding that [...] "if Bill Weld were {{at the top of the}} ticket, it would be very easy for me to vote for Bill Weld for president." [...] In September he called for Johnson to be included in the presidential debates and in October it emerged that Independent candidate Evan McMullin was using an email list of 2.5 million Romney supporters to raise money. McMullin's chief strategist said that it was purchased from Romney for President and that [...] "we'll let <b>other</b> <b>folks</b> discuss what that may mean and certainly never speak for [...] ". A spokeswoman for Romney said that the list had been [...] "rented by several political candidates in the presidential primary, and by countless other political and commercial users in the time since the 2012 campaign" [...] and Romney made no public comment on McMullin's candidacy. Romney and his wife cast early ballots in Utah, but he declined to say who he voted for.|$|E

2500|$|One day Vickery said, [...] "Look, if it's so {{important}} to get CPR started quickly and if firemen come around to do it, it can't be that complicated that <b>other</b> <b>folks</b> couldn't also learn—firemen are not created by God to do CPR. You could train the public." [...] Cobb said, [...] "That sounds like a very good idea." ...|$|E
2500|$|More {{conservative}} voices included Margaret O'Brien Steinfels of the Catholic magazine Commonweal, who, in the New York Times Book Review, {{described the}} book as “a model polemic” and admired Bawer's [...] "efforts {{to be fair and}} balanced". Yet she rejected Bawer's call for same-sex marriage, arguing that insisting on it “is likely to prove... explosive.” Gay-rights opponent Maggie Gallagher, while calling the book [...] "fascinating," [...] criticized Bawer for being dissatisfied with [...] "mere tolerance". Helle Bering-Jensen, in the Washington Times, sounded a similar note, arguing that while most Americans “are quite happy to let <b>other</b> <b>folks</b> live the lives they please,” many “draw the line... at gays in the military, gay marriages, gay parenting and so forth.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 25, Norris {{wrote on}} her website that the {{response}} to her idea had surprised and shocked her: [...] "I did not intend for my cartoon to go viral. I {{did not intend to}} be the focus of any 'group'. I practice the First Amendment by drawing what I wish. This particular cartoon of a 'poster' seems to have struck a gigantic nerve, something I was totally unprepared for. I am going back to the drawing table now!" [...] On April 26, she wrote on her website: [...] "I am NOT involved in [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammd [...] Day! I made a cartoon that went viral and I am not going with it. Many <b>other</b> <b>folks</b> have used my cartoon to start sites, etc. Please go to them as I am a private person who draws stuff". She also asked Savage to replace the original illustration she had given him with another one she drew that was tamer, but Savage refused. Asked why she initially publicized it, she replied, [...] "Because I'm an idiot." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2014, Kaine {{argued that}} the U.S. {{military}} intervention against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), undertaken by President Obama, was unconstitutional without a new congressional authorization {{for the use of}} military force against ISIL. In November 2014, at the Halifax International Security Forum, Kaine, together with Senator John McCain, emphasized the necessity of such a congressional authorization, saying: [...] "You just can't have a war without Congress. You can't ask people to risk their lives, risk getting killed, seeing <b>other</b> <b>folks</b> getting killed or injured if Congress isn't willing to do the job to put their thumbprint on this and say, this is a national mission and worth it." [...] After the April 2017 Shayrat missile strike in Syria, ordered by President Donald Trump, Kaine said: [...] "There is no legal justification for this. He should not have done this without coming to Congress." [...] On Meet the Press, Kaine stated: [...] "I'm a strong supporter that the U.S. should take action to protect humanitarian causes, like the ban on chemical weapons. Where I differ from this administration, and I took the same position with respect to President Obama, we are a nation that's not supposed to take military action, start war, without a plan that's presented to and approved by Congress." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Water Babies, a {{fairy tale}} for a land baby by Charles Kingsley (serialised in Macmillan's Magazine 1862–63, {{published}} in book form, with additions, in 1863). Kingsley had been among first to give a favourable review to Darwin's On the Origin of Species, having [...] "long since... learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species", and the story includes a satire on the reaction to Darwin's theory, with the main scientific participants appearing, including Richard Owen and Huxley. In 1892 Thomas Henry Huxley's five-year-old grandson Julian saw the illustration by Edward Linley Sambourne (right) and wrote his grandfather a letter asking: Dear Grandpater– Have you seen a Waterbaby? Did {{you put it in}} a bottle? Did it wonder if it could get out? Could I see it some day?– Your loving Julian. Huxley wrote back: My dear Julian– I could never make sure about that Water Baby... My friend who wrote the story of the Water Baby was a very kind man and very clever. Perhaps he thought I could see as much in the water as he did– There are some people who see a great deal and some who see very little in the same things.When you grow up I dare say you {{will be one of the}} great-deal seers, and see things more wonderful than the Water Babies where <b>other</b> <b>folks</b> can see nothing.|$|E
