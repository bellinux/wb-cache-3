As it turned out, turkey waste may still be used as feed in the United States, so that the facility must purchase that feed stock at a cost of $30 to $40 per ton, adding $15 to $20 per barrel to the cost of the oil. Final cost, as of January 2005, was $80/barrel ($1.90/gal).|$|E

The hood of an amauti, (women's parka, plural amautiit) was traditionally made extra large with a separate compartment below the hood to allow the mother to carry a baby against her back and protect it from the harsh wind.

25|$|Milk {{and dairy}} {{products}} {{have the potential for}} causing serious infection in newborn infants. Unpasteurized milk and cheeses can promote the growth of Listeria bacteria. Listeria monocytogenes can also cause serious infection in an infant and pregnant woman and can be transmitted to her infant in utero or after birth. The infection has the potential of seriously harming or even causing the death of a preterm infant, an infant of low or very low birth weight, or an infant with an immune system defect or a congenital defect of the immune system. The presence of this pathogen can sometimes be determined by the symptoms that appear as a gastrointestinal illness in the mother. The mother can also acquire infection from ingesting food that contains <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> such as, hot dogs, delicatessen meats, and cheese.|$|E

Before the arrival of the Russian fur traders (promyshlennikis), caribou and beaver skins were used for traditional clothing but subsequently, the Eskimos were persuaded to sell most furs and substitute manufactured materials. Everyday functional items like skin mittens, mukluks, and jackets are commonly made today, but the elegant fancy parkas (atkupiaq) of traditional times are now rare. Today, many Yup'ik have adopted western-style clothing.|$|E

The production of animal-based (livestock) foods is associated with high carbon footprint which contributes significantly to the acceleration of global climate change.

40|$|Extract] Chapters 4 and 5 {{confirm that}} in both {{rural and urban}} China {{consumption}} of foodgrain has been declining while that of <b>other</b> foods, especially <b>animal</b> <b>products,</b> has been increasing. Increased consumption of <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> requires more feedgrains to produce extra animals. Indeed, it has been increasingly recognised that feedgrain demand in China will become the major component of China's total grain demand. Many believe that any future increase in total grain demand in China will be mainly caused by an increasing demand for feedgrains (for example, Garnaut and Ma 1992; Findlay 1998, p. 32; Zhou and Tian 2003). As a derived demand, the demand for feedgrains {{is closely related to}} the demand for <b>animal</b> <b>products.</b> As such, an understanding of <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> consumption trends in China is invaluable. It is imperative to gain reliable infonnation about the current level of <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> consumption, as this is fundamental to predicting the likely consumption of <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> and hence to shed light on likely demand for feedgrains...|$|R
40|$|The FAST Eggs Plan is a {{voluntary}} plan for commercial egg producers intended to facilitate business continuity following {{an outbreak of}} HPAI. Participation in the FAST Eggs Plan will reduce the time required for regulatory officials to determine that it is safe for eggs and egg products from noninfected chickens located within a control area to move into market channels located outside the control area. The FAST Eggs Plan has 5 components. First, a Biosecurity Checklist for Egg Production Premises and Auditors includes biosecurity measures that will help prevent introduction of avian influenza virus onto egg-production premises. Second, registration with the National Animal Identification System is required for participating egg-production premises, and the premises location is verified by GPS coordinates. Third, epidemiological data are used to determine whether an egg farm has been exposed directly or indirectly to birds and <b>other</b> <b>animals,</b> <b>products,</b> materials, people, or aerosols from premises on which HPAI virus has been confirmed. Fourth, the absence of HPAI virus on FAST Eggs Plan premises is verified by negative RRT-PCR assay results from a minimum of 5 dead chickens selected from those that die each day from each house on the farm. Fifth, the risk of exposure to HPAI virus is estimated by use of an equation based on risks not mitigated by quarantine and distance from infected premises...|$|R
2500|$|According {{to local}} oral {{tradition}}, in the 11th century {{the island of}} Kilwa Kisiwani was sold to Ali bin Hasan, son of the [...] "King" [...] of Shiraz, in Persia.

Though he was credited with the founding, he had arrived at an already inhabited area. He did, however, come to power and is credited with fortifying the city and increasing trade. Tradition also relates that it was the child of this union who founded the Kilwa Sultanate. Archaeological and documentary research has revealed that over the next few centuries, Kilwa grew to be a substantial city and the leading commercial entrepôt on the southern half of the Swahili Coast (roughly from the present Tanzanian-Kenya border southward to the mouth of the Zambezi River), trading extensively with states of the Southeast African hinterland as far as Zimbabwe.
