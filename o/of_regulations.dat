Ethical explanations centered on executive greed and hubris, a lack of corporate social responsibility, situation ethics, and get-it-done business pragmatism. Political-economic explanations cited post-1970s deregulation, and inadequate staff and funding for regulatory oversight. A more libertarian analysis maintained that Enron’s collapse resulted from the company’s reliance on political lobbying, rent-seeking, and the gaming <b>of</b> <b>regulations.</b>|$|E

Later he held two significant public appointed posts: chief of forestry in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, from 1933 to 1937, and head of recreation management in the Forest Service, from 1937 to 1939, both during the administration of President Franklin D.

5|$|Edward II was a {{weak and}} ineffectual king (made {{to look the}} more so by {{comparison}} {{with his father and}} son, Edward I and Edward III), and his reign was marked by military failure and internal strife. A great number of the barony turned against the King, and the leader of the opposition eventually became Thomas of Lancaster. Lancaster was Edward's cousin, and next to the King he was the richest man in the country. Through a set <b>of</b> <b>regulations</b> known as the Ordinances, Lancaster and his associates had been trying to put restrictions on royal authority, but by the late 1310s Edward was again in full control of central government. The situation was aggravated by the King's ostentatious patronage of his favourite, Hugh Despenser, and Hugh's father by the same name.|$|E

A number of the summoned bishops and other church officials did not attend and Eugene suspended many of the non-attendees, excepting the Italian ecclesiastics, who were excused. The council lasted 11 days, and convened on 21 March 1148. From 400 to 1100 ecclesiastics are considered to have attended, although this number does not include the various servants and officials of the attendees, who would have swelled the numbers.|$|E
40|$|The author {{examines}} whether exemptions {{for small}} businesses and small transactions that appear in many regulations are economically efficient. The cost <b>of</b> <b>regulation</b> has both variable and fixed components. As demonstrated by many empirical studies of regulatory compliance costs, the fixed costs <b>of</b> <b>regulation,</b> and some <b>of</b> the variable costs, are subject to economies of scale that benefit larger firms and larger transactions. Though {{it is harder to}} measure the benefits <b>of</b> <b>regulation,</b> the benefits <b>of</b> <b>regulation</b> generally vary in proportion {{to the size of the}} regulated firm or transaction. The author develops a mathematical model of how the costs and benefits <b>of</b> <b>regulation</b> vary with size and concludes that, no matter what assumptions one makes in constructing that model, it supports small business exemptions. However, when transactions costs, the cumulative effect <b>of</b> <b>regulation,</b> and other real-world issues are considered, the case for small business exemptions is more ambiguous...|$|R

For the Australian Grand Prix, these were the super-soft, soft and medium compounds. With Pirelli providing every driver with two sets of tyres for the race (of which one must be used) and an additional one for the third part of qualifying, drivers were able to choose ten additional sets of tyres out of the three compounds available. Notably, Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg made different choices, with Rosberg opting for an additional set of mediums instead of soft tyres. The two Manor drivers chose the most conservative way, taking on four sets each of the medium and soft compounds.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law, a set <b>of</b> <b>regulations</b> promulgated by NASA on July 16 to codify its quarantine protocol, the astronauts continued in quarantine out of concern that the Moon might contain undiscovered pathogens and that the astronauts might {{have been exposed to}} them during their Moon walks. However, after three weeks in confinement (first in the Apollo spacecraft, then in their trailer on the Hornet, and finally in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at the Manned Spacecraft Center), the astronauts were given a clean bill of health. On August 10, 1969, the Interagency Committee on Back Contamination met in Atlanta and lifted the quarantine on the astronauts, on those who had joined them in quarantine (NASA physician William Carpentier and MQF project engineer John Hirasaki), and on Columbia itself. Loose equipment from the spacecraft would remain in isolation until the lunar samples were released for study.|$|E

5|$|The Anglo-Saxons {{were the}} first people in {{northern}} Europe to write administrative documents in the vernacular, and law codes in Old English go back to Æthelberht of Kent {{at the beginning of}} the seventh century. The law code of Alfred the Great, from the end of the ninth century, was also written in the vernacular, and he expected his ealdormen to learn it. His code was strongly influenced by Carolingian law going back to Charlemagne in such areas as treason, peace-keeping, organisation of the hundreds and judicial ordeal. It remained in force throughout the tenth century, and Æthelstan's codes were built on this foundation. Legal codes required the approval of the king, but they were treated as guidelines which could be adapted and added to at local level, rather than a fixed canon <b>of</b> <b>regulations,</b> and customary oral law was also important in the Anglo-Saxon period.|$|E

5|$|The skins of wild {{cats and}} other mammals have been highly valued by the fur trade for many decades. From the {{beginning}} of the 20th-century Jaguars were hunted in large numbers, but over-harvest and habitat destruction reduced the availability and induced hunters and traders to gradually shift to smaller species by the 1960s. The international trade of jaguar skins had its largest boom between the end of the Second World War and the early 1970, due to the growing economy and lack <b>of</b> <b>regulations.</b> From 1967 onwards, the regulations introduced by national laws and international agreements diminished the reported international trade from as high as 13000 skins in 1967, through 7000 skins in 1969, until it became negligible after 1976, although illegal trade and smuggling continue to be a problem. During this period, the biggest exporters were Brazil and Paraguay, and the biggest importers were the USA and Germany.|$|E

5|$|Fisheries {{operating}} off Portugal and Japan {{are responsible}} for most commercial landings of the kitefin shark, generally as bycatch in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line. Portugal reported a kitefin shark bycatch of 282 tons in 2000 and 119 tons in 2003. In {{other areas of the}} northeastern Atlantic this shark is rare and reported catches are likely confounded by misidentifications of other species; some are caught by mixed-species gillnet fisheries operating in deep water west of the British Isles, where surveys suggest that kitefin shark numbers may have declined by 94% since the 1970s. In the Mediterranean, this shark is caught incidentally by bottom trawl and gillnet fisheries. Although it is generally discarded alive, many are unable to return to deep water and do not survive. In the Southern Hemisphere, catches by the Australian South East Trawl Fishery are increasing following the relaxation <b>of</b> <b>regulations</b> regarding seafood mercury content; this species is not included under Australian fishery quotas. New Zealand kitefin shark catches peaked from 1986 to 1997. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the kitefin shark as Near Threatened worldwide, and as Vulnerable in the northeastern Atlantic in light of documented population declines.|$|E
