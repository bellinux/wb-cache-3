40|$|E. L. Thorndike {{explains}} {{the connection of}} situation and response, first of all, under the “law of effect,” but E. R. Guthrie does not admit it and insists on that “a stimulus pattern gains its full associative strength {{on the occasion of}} its first pairing with a response”, that is, association by contiguity. According to this theory, he has studied in detail the behavior of cats in the puzzle-box, with the result that cats always showed the repetition of idetical behaviors, and the movements in escaping from the situation tended to be fixed. The cats learnt method <b>of</b> <b>escape</b> at their first trial and afterwards the same method of solving was repeated. E. R. Guthrie has insisted upon this theory. Our experiments aimed atstudying the cats' posture <b>of</b> <b>escape</b> in the puzzle-box. The results of experiment are as follows : 1) As to various movements in the puzzle-box at early phases of trial, cats wander to and fro, and scratch at the gaps inside, showing complex movements,but after the eleventh trial or so, the movements in the puzzlebox become symplified. 2) Cats' postures <b>of</b> <b>escape</b> are transformed with the increase of trial and at last become a few stereotyped posture <b>of</b> <b>escape,</b> as if selected. 3) The posture <b>of</b> <b>escape</b> <b>of</b> the second trial shows the entire agreement with that of the first trial. 4) Any posture <b>of</b> <b>escape</b> is repeated; when a new posture <b>of</b> <b>escape</b> is suddenly made it is also repeated. 5) With the increase of frequency of trial, the posture <b>of</b> <b>escape,</b> it seems, becomes efficient for the reward-box. 6) The transformation of the posture <b>of</b> <b>escape,</b> which is modified only a little by the increase of the frequency of trial, seems to depend on the position of relative contiguity to the pole...|$|R
5|$|Docter {{began working}} on the story in 2004, {{which was based on}} fantasies <b>of</b> <b>escaping</b> from life when it becomes too irritating. He and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days in Venezuela {{gathering}} research and inspiration. The designs of the characters were caricatured and stylized considerably, and animators were challenged with creating realistic cloth.

She is loved by the undead pirate LeChuck, who never ceases to pursue her affections and attempts to turn her into his undead bride, but Elaine instead falls in love with hapless protagonist Guybrush Threepwood. Elaine is consistently kidnapped by LeChuck, prompting Guybrush to attempt a rescue, although Elaine is usually more than capable <b>of</b> <b>escaping</b> predicaments by herself. She eventually marries Guybrush and relinquishes her gubernatorial responsibilities to her grandfather, travelling with Guybrush to the fictional Gulf of Melange to cure the outbreak of a voodoo-empowered pox.|$|E

5|$|Eyespots are {{a type of}} automimicry used by some lepidopterans. In butterflies, {{the spots}} are {{composed}} of concentric rings of scales of different colours. The proposed role of the eyespots is to deflect predators' attention. Their resemblance to eyes provokes the predator's instinct to attack these wing patterns. The role of filamentous tails in Lycaenidae has been suggested as confusing predators as to the real location of the head, giving them a better chance <b>of</b> <b>escaping</b> alive and relatively unscathed.|$|E
5|$|Other than humans, tigers {{appear to}} be the only serious predators of wolves. Wolf and tiger {{interactions}} are well documented in Sikhote-Alin, where tigers depress wolf numbers, either to the point of localized extinction or to such low numbers as to make them a functionally insignificant component of the ecosystem. Wolves appear capable <b>of</b> <b>escaping</b> competitive exclusion from tigers only when human persecution decreases tiger numbers. Proven cases of tigers killing wolves are rare and attacks {{appear to be}} competitive rather than predatory in nature, with at least four proven records of tigers killing wolves without consuming them.|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} <b>of</b> <b>escape</b> from {{an attractive}} state due to random perturbations is of central interest to many areas in science. Previous studies <b>of</b> <b>escape</b> in chaotic systems have rather {{focused on the}} case of unbounded noise, usually assumed to have Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we address the problem <b>of</b> <b>escape</b> induced by bounded noise. We show that the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>escape</b> from an attractor's basin is equivalent to that of a closed system with an appropriately chosen "hole". Using this equivalence, we show that there is a minimum noise amplitude above which escape takes place, and we derive analytical expressions for the scaling <b>of</b> the <b>escape</b> rate with noise amplitude near the escape transition. We verify our analytical predictions through numerical simulations of a two-dimensional map with noise. Comment: up to date with published versio...|$|R

5|$|These geyser observations, {{along with}} the finding <b>of</b> <b>escaping</b> {{internal}} heat and very few (if any) impact craters in the south polar region, show that Enceladus is currently geologically active. Like many other satellites in the extensive systems of the giant planets, Enceladus is trapped in an orbital resonance. Its resonance with Dione excites its orbital eccentricity, which is damped by tidal forces, tidally heating its interior, possibly driving the geological activity.|$|E

5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} <b>of</b> <b>escaping</b> from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing {{a picture of a}} grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl {{in the way that they}} relate to their grandparents.|$|E

Each was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment for escaping from Manchester Crown Court, and Azzopardi received an additional two-year sentence for escaping from the van transporting him from HM Prison Hull to the court. In July 1994, David Bowen was convicted of attempting to pervert the course of justice by attempting to influence {{the jury in the}} first riot trial, and was sentenced to three years imprisonment. Paul Taylor, who had already pleaded guilty to the same charge, also received a three-year sentence.|$|E
5|$|On 4 May a {{group of}} around forty men carried out the Acre Prison break, {{releasing}} forty-one Jews and 214 Arabs. At {{the same time a}} mortar attack was carried out on the 2nd Parachute Battalion's camp, as a diversion. The first unit to reach the prison was a platoon from the 1st Parachute Battalion, 35 minutes later. Other men from the battalion and some divisional units were bathing in the sea a short distance from the prison. A truck load <b>of</b> <b>escaping</b> prisoners opened fire on one unit's armoured car. The escaping truck then reached an improvised road block set up by some bathers and crashed under fire. The division's bathing party killed four attackers, four Jewish and one Arab escapee, and recaptured thirteen Jews. The bathers had eight men wounded during the short battle. While this was going on, the 1st Parachute Brigade was establishing a cordon around Acre and the surrounding area but no further escapees were caught.|$|E
5|$|Some insects, {{occupying the}} {{biological}} niches that they do, {{need to be}} incredibly maneuverable. They must find their food in tight spaces and be capable <b>of</b> <b>escaping</b> larger predators – or they may themselves be predators, and need to capture prey. Their maneuverability, from an aerodynamic viewpoint, is provided by high lift and thrust forces. Typical insect fliers can attain lift forces up to three times their weight and horizontal thrust forces up to five times their weight. There are two substantially different insect flight mechanisms, and {{each has its own}} advantages and disadvantages – just because odonates have a more primitive flight mechanism does not mean they are less able fliers; they are, in certain ways, more agile than anything that has evolved afterward.|$|E

5|$|The abdomen is {{composed}} of five somites, all of which lack appendages except the last. The back-facing margins of these somites bear small spines and four or more larger spines. The last abdominal somite forks {{into a pair of}} flattened spatulate appendages (the uropods) that function as a tail fan (caudal rami). In addition to stabilising the body while swimming, a quick flick of the tail fan can rapidly propel the animal backwards, which may have functioned as a means <b>of</b> <b>escaping</b> predators like in modern shrimp. Traces of four fused segments are evident in the three faint lines dividing each lobe of the tail fan. A long telson is present {{at the end of the}} body. Traces of a rounded stomach, small digestive glands, and an intestine that terminates into a tiny anal opening on the telson can also be observed in some specimens.|$|E
5|$|More actions {{took place}} on the 14th. Murat's forces joined Dupont at Albeck just in time to drive off an Austrian attack from Werneck; {{together}} Murat and Dupont beat the Austrians to the north in the direction of Heidenheim. By night on the 14th, two French corps were stationed {{in the vicinity of the}} Austrian encampments at Michelsberg, right outside of Ulm. Mack was now in a dangerous situation: there was no longer any hope <b>of</b> <b>escaping</b> along the north bank, Marmont and the Imperial Guard were hovering at the outskirts of Ulm to the south of the river, and Soult was moving north from Memmingen to prevent the Austrians escaping south to the Tyrol. Troubles continued with the Austrian command as Ferdinand overrode the objections of Mack and ordered the evacuation of all cavalry from Ulm, a total of 6,000 troopers. Murat's pursuit was so effective, however, that only eleven squadrons joined Werneck at Heidenheim. Murat continued his harassment of Werneck and forced him to surrender with 8,000 men at Treuchtlingen on 19 October; Murat also took an entire Austrian field park of 500 vehicles, then swept on towards Neustadt an der Donau and captured 12,000 Austrians.|$|E
5|$|On June 7, 1855, the 183-ft. vessel Benjamin Franklin {{put into}} Hampton Roads for repairs. She had just sailed from the West Indies where {{there had been}} an {{outbreak}} of yellow fever. The port health officer ordered the ship quarantined. After eleven days, a second inspection found no issues, so she was allowed to dock. A few days later, the first cases of yellow fever were discovered in Norfolk, and a machinist died from the disease on July 8. By August, several people were dying per day, and a third of the city's population had fled in the hopes <b>of</b> <b>escaping</b> the epidemic. No one understood how the disease was transmitted. With both Norfolk and Portsmouth being infected, New York banned all traffic from those sites. Neighboring cities also banned residents from Norfolk. The epidemic spread through the city via mosquitoes and poor sanitation, affecting every family and causing widespread panic. The number of infected reached 5,000 in September, and by the second week, 1,500 had died in Norfolk and Portsmouth. As the weather cooled, the outbreak began to wane, leaving a final tally of about 3,200 dead. It took the city some time to recover.|$|E
