25|$|The Continental Congress {{passed the}} Land Ordinance of 1785 {{and then the}} Northwest Ordinance in 1787 to control the survey, sale, and {{settling}} of the new lands. The original 13 colonies donated their western lands to the new Union, {{for the purpose of}} giving land for new states. These include the lands that formed the Northwest Territory, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi. The state that gave up the most was Virginia, whose <b>original</b> <b>claim</b> included most of the Northwest Territory and Kentucky, too. Some of the western land was claimed by more than one state, especially in the Northwest, where parts were claimed by Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut, all three of which had claimed lands {{all the way to the}} Pacific Ocean.|$|E

25|$|On 12 February 1971 {{testimony}} was completed and a verdict expected. However, in March the court advised a settlement, explaining appeals were extremely time consuming. Negotiations began on 22 March and concluded on 24 December, {{three and a}} half years after the case had begun. Nikkatsu paid Suzuki ¥1000000, a fraction of his <b>original</b> <b>claim,</b> and Hori was forced to apologize for comments he made while serving as president. In a separate agreement Nikkatsu donated Fighting Elegy and Branded to Kill to the Tokyo National Museum of Modern Art's Film Centre. At the time of settlement Suzuki expressed fears that if he had continued to fight he might not even be able to get an apology from the failing company. During the course of the litigation Nikkatsu was being slowly dismantled. Hori's plans to restructure the company were unsuccessful and Nikkatsu was forced to liquidate studios and headquarter buildings. It released two final films in August 1971 and by November began producing roman poruno, softcore romantic pornography. Despite Suzuki's victory with wide support from the public and film world he was blacklisted by all major production companies and unable to make another film for 10 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} {{borders are}} far less contentious than those in northern Pakistan (Kashmir). The Thar Desert {{in the province of}} Sindh is separated in the south from the salt flats of the Rann of Kachchh (Kutch) by a boundary that was first delineated in 1923–24. After independence and dissolution of Empire, Independent and free Pakistan contested the southern boundary of Sindh, and a succession of border incidents resulted. They were less dangerous and less widespread, however, than the conflict that erupted in Kashmir in the Indo-Pakistani War of August 1965 started with this decisive core of issues. These southern hostilities were ended by British mediation during Harold Wilson's era, and both sides accepted the award of the Indo-Pakistan Western Boundary Case Tribunal designated by the UN secretary general himself. The tribunal made its award on February 19, 1968; delimiting a line of 403 kilometers that was later demarcated by joint survey teams, Of its <b>original</b> <b>claim</b> of some 9,100 square kilometers, Pakistan was awarded only about 780 square kilometers. Beyond the western terminus of the tribunal's award, the final stretch of Pakistan's border with India is about 80 kilometers long, running east and southeast of Sindh to an inlet of the Arabian Sea.|$|E
500|$|A student {{film society}} run by Kazuko Kawakita, the Cineclub Study Group, was {{planning}} to include Branded to Kill in a retrospective honouring Suzuki's works but Hori refused them and withdrew all of his films from circulation. With support from the Cineclub, similar student groups, fellow filmmakers and the general public—which included the picketing of the company's Hibiya offices {{and the formation of}} the Seijun Suzuki Joint Struggle Committee—Suzuki sued Nikkatsu for wrongful dismissal. During the three-and-a-half year trial the circumstances under which the film was made and Suzuki was fired came to light. He had been made into a scapegoat for the company's dire financial straits and was meant to serve as an example on the outset of an attempted company-wide restructuring. A settlement was reached on December 24, 1971, in the amount of one million yen, a fraction of his <b>original</b> <b>claim,</b> as well as a public apology from Hori. In a separate agreement Branded to Kill and his previous film, Fighting Elegy, were donated to the Tokyo National Museum of Modern Art's Film Centre. The events turned Suzuki into a legend and shook the film world. Branded to Kill, along with other of his films, played to [...] "packed audiences who wildly applauded" [...] at all-night revivals in and around Tokyo. However, Suzuki was blacklisted by the major studios and did not make another feature film until A Tale of Sorrow and Sadness (1977) ten years after Branded to Kill. In the meantime, he subsisted on commercial and television work and writing books of essays.|$|E

5000|$|Many late-comers were {{jealous of}} the {{original}} discoverers, and tried to [...] "jump" [...] the <b>original</b> <b>claims</b> by filing claims covering the same ground. The federal judge for the area ruled the <b>original</b> <b>claims</b> valid, {{but some of the}} claim jumpers agreed to share their invalid claims with influential U.S. politicians. One of these, Alexander McKenzie, a Republican from North Dakota, took interest in the gold rush and seized mining claims {{with the help of a}} crooked judge, A. Noyes. Mckenzie's claim-jumping scheme was eventually stopped by the federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals; however, the episode provided the plot for Rex Beach's best-selling novel The Spoilers (1906), which was made into a stage play and movies, most famously The Spoilers (1942) starring John Wayne.

2500|$|However, neither Belgium nor Prussia (now within Germany) {{had ever}} {{surrendered}} its <b>original</b> <b>claim</b> to it. Around 1900, Germany {{in particular was}} taking a more aggressive stance towards the territory and was accused of sabotage and of obstructing the administrative process in order to force the issue. It was the First World War, however, that was the catalyst that brought {{about the end of}} neutrality. On 4 August 1914, Germany invaded Belgium, leaving Moresnet at first [...] "an oasis in a desert of destruction". In 1915, the territory was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia, without international recognition.|$|E
2500|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and the Gadsden Purchase, the United States was {{required}} to recognize and honor existing land grants made by either the Spanish or Mexican governments. Reavis utilized this provision by manufacturing a fictional claim and then generating a collection of documents demonstrating how the claim came into his possession. The documents were then covertly inserted into various records archives. In his initial claim, Reavis claimed title to the grant via a series of conveyances. [...] When serious challenges to this claim developed, Reavis developed a second claim by marrying the purported last surviving lineal descendant of the <b>original</b> <b>claim</b> recipient.|$|E
2500|$|Formal {{filing of}} the second claim {{occurred}} on September 2, 1887. [...] Included with the official copies and photographs of original wills and codicils was {{a photograph of the}} third Baroness standing before the [...] "Inicial Monument". [...] With the discovery of this marker, the claim was shifted [...] south. [...] To address possible inconsistencies with his <b>original</b> <b>claim,</b> Reavis claimed he suspected some of Willing's papers to be forgeries, but upon advice of his lawyers had filed his initial claim to initially establish the grant before U.S. authorities and to buy time while searching for proof of his wife's identity. [...] Reavis also posted a US$10,000 deposit to assure an official survey of the grant. [...] Surveyor General John Hise refused to allow the survey as it would imply government approval of the claim.|$|E

Besides, the Battle of Dongkou took place in 222–223, about 31 years after Sun Jian's death, so if Sun Kuang died in his early 20s (as mentioned in the Sanguozhi), {{he could not have}} possibly lived until 222.

In its report of the following day, however, OCHA said the school itself had been shelled. On 2 February, OCHA [...] corrected the statement, clarifying that the shelling, and all of the fatalities, took place outside rather than inside the school. OCHA and UNRWA denied that they had ever verbally accused Israel of hitting the school.

2500|$|Since the Partition of British India in 1947, Pakistan and India {{remained}} in contention over several issues. Although the Kashmir conflict was the predominant issue dividing the nations, other border disputes existed, most notably over the Rann of Kutch, a barren {{region in the}} Indian state of Gujarat. The issue first arose in 1956 which ended with India regaining control over the disputed area. Pakistani patrols began patrolling in territory controlled by India in January 1965, which was followed by attacks by both countries on each other's posts on 8 April 1965. [...] Initially involving border police from both nations, the disputed area soon witnessed intermittent skirmishes between the countries' armed forces. In June 1965, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson successfully persuaded both countries to end hostilities {{and set up a}} tribunal to resolve the dispute.
