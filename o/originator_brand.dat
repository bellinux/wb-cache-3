40|$|Abstract Background To {{evaluate}} medicine prices, {{availability and}} affordability in Brazil, considering the differences across {{three types of}} medicines (<b>originator</b> <b>brands,</b> generics and similar medicines) and different types of facilities (private pharmacies, public sector pharmacies and “popular pharmacies”). Methods Data on prices and availability of 50 medicines were collected in 56 pharmacies across six cities in Southern Brazil using the World Health Organization / Health Action International methodology. Median prices obtained were divided by international reference prices to derive the median price ratio (MPR). Results In the private sector, prices were 8. 6 MPR for similar medicines, 11. 3 MRP for generics and 18. 7 MRP for <b>originator</b> <b>brands,</b> respectively. Mean availability was 65 %, 74 % and 48 % for <b>originator</b> <b>brands,</b> generics and similar medicines, respectively. In the public sector, mean availability of similar medicines was 2 – 7 times {{higher than that of}} generics. Mean overall availability in the public sector ranged from 68. 8 % to 81. 7 %. In “popular pharmacies”, mean availability was greater than 90 % in all cities. Conclusions Availability of medicines in the public sector does not meet the challenge of supplying essential medicines to the entire population, as stated in the Brazilian constitution. This has unavoidable repercussions for affordability, particularly amongst the lower socio-economic strata. </p...|$|R

40|$|WHO {{has set a}} {{voluntary}} target of 80 % availability of affordable essential medicines, including generics, to treat major non-communicable diseases (NCDs), in {{the public and private}} sectors of countries by 2025. We undertook a secondary analysis of data from 30 surveys in low- and middle-income countries, conducted from 2008 - 2015 using the World Health Organization (WHO) /Health Action International (HAI) medicine availability and price survey methodology, to establish a baseline for this target. Data for 49 medicines (lowest priced generics and <b>originator</b> <b>brands)</b> to treat cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and central nervous system (CNS) conditions were analysed to determine their availability in healthcare facilities and pharmacies, their affordability for those on low incomes (based on median patient prices of each medicine), and the percentage of medicines that were both available and affordable. Affordability was expressed as the number of days' wages of the lowest-paid unskilled government worker needed to purchase 30 days' supply using standard treatment regimens. Paying more than 1 days' wages was considered unaffordable. In low-income countries, 15. 2 % and 18. 9 % of lowest-priced generics met WHO's target in {{the public and private sectors}}, respectively, and 2. 6 % and 5. 2 % of <b>originator</b> <b>brands.</b> In lower-middle income countries, 23. 8 % and 23. 2 % of lowest priced generics, and 0. 8 % and 1. 4 % of <b>originator</b> <b>brands,</b> met the target in the public and private sectors, respectively. In upper-middle income countries, the situation was better for generics but still suboptimal as 36. 0 % and 39. 4 % met the target in public and private sectors, respectively. For <b>originator</b> <b>brands</b> in upper-middle income countries, none reached the target in the public sector and 13. 7 % in the private sector. Across the therapeutic groups for lowest priced generics, CVD medicines in low-income countries (11. 9 %), and CNS medicines in lower-middle (10. 2 %) and upper-middle income countries (33. 3 %), were least available and affordable in the public sector. In the private sector for lowest priced generics, CNS medicines were least available and affordable in all three country income groups (11. 4 %, 5. 8 % and 29. 3 % in low-, lower-middle and upper-middle income countries respectively). This data, which can act as a baseline for the WHO target, shows low availability and/or poor affordability is resulting in few essential NCD medicines meeting the target in low- and middle-income countries. In the era of Sustainable Development Goals, and as countries work to achieve Universal Health Coverage, increased commitments are needed by governments to improve the situation through the development of evidence-informed, nationally-contextualised interventions, with regular monitoring of NCD medicine availability, patient prices and affordability...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2011. This study {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of generic medicine competition on the market share growth and pricing of <b>originator</b> <b>brand</b> medicine in the South African private pharmaceutical market. The study is based on five years (2005 to 2011) of IMS Health market share data for 39 <b>originator</b> <b>brand</b> drugs that {{have been exposed to}} competition from generic substitutes from 2001. The results show that, for all the drug molecules included in the study pooled together, the price of an <b>originator</b> <b>brand</b> medicine relative to the weighted average price of its generics has a significant negative impact on the change of its market share. Results for the molecules pooled according to anatomical classes, as well as each molecule separately, show that in four out of the nine classes represented in the study and nine out of the 39 molecules the relative price of the <b>originator</b> <b>brand</b> medicine had a significant negative impact on its change in market share. The manufacturers and marketers of generic medicines would be well advised to offer their medicines at significantly discounted prices compared to the originator brands, as the results suggest that the market penetration of the generic product may depend heavily on the price the generics are offered at. Investigations into the prices of the originator brands in relation with the number of generic equivalents in the market show that the number of generics available in a specific market has a significant positive impact on the relative price of originators, thereby making originators relatively more expensive compared with their generic competitors, {{while at the same time}} the results show that the absolute price of the <b>originator</b> <b>brand</b> medicines declines as the number of generic equivalents in the market increases. This indicates that, from a policy perspective, reducing the barriers to entry for generic medicine once originator patents expire may have a significant role to play in reducing the cost of pharmaceutical drugs in the South African market...|$|E
40|$|Background: Limited {{access to}} {{essential}} medicines {{is a global}} problem. Improving availability and affordability of essential medicines is a key objective of the National Essential Medicine Policy (NEMP) in China. In its initial implementation in 2009, the NEMP targeted primary hospitals with policies designed to increase availability of essential medicines and reduce patients' economic burden from purchasing medicines. We assessed medicine availability and price {{during the early years}} of the health reform in Shaanxi Province in underdeveloped western China. Methods: We undertook two public (hospitals) and private (pharmacy) sector surveys of prices and availability of medicines, in September, 2010 and April, 2012, by a standard methodology developed by WHO and Health Action International. We measured medicine availability in outlets at the time of the surveys and inflation-adjusted median unit prices (MUPs), taking 2010 as the base year. We used general estimating equations to calculate the significance of differences in availability from 2010 to 2012 and the Wilcoxon signed rank test to calculate the significance of differences in adjusted median prices. Findings: We collected data from 50 public sector hospitals and 36 private sector retail pharmacies in 2010 and 72 public hospitals and 72 retail pharmacies in 2012. Mean availability of surveyed medicines was low in both the public and private sectors; availability of many essential medicines decreased from 2010 to 2012, particularly in primary hospitals (from 27 · 4 % to 22 · 3 % for lowest priced generics; p< 0 · 0001). The MUPs of <b>originator</b> <b>brands</b> and their generic equivalents decreased significantly from 2010 to 2012 in primary hospitals in comparison with secondary and tertiary hospitals. In the public sector, the median adjusted patient price was significantly lower in 2012 than in 2010 for 16 <b>originator</b> <b>brands</b> (difference − 11 · 7 %; p= 0 · 0019) and 29 lowest-priced generics (– 5 · 2 %; p= 0 · 0015); the median government procurement price for <b>originator</b> <b>brands</b> also decreased significantly (– 10 · 9 %; p= 0 · 0004), whereas the decrease in median procurement price for lowest-priced generics was not significant (– 4 · 9 %; p= 0 · 17). In the private sector, the median percentage decrease in price between 2010 and 2012 for 38 lowest-priced generics was 4 · 7 % (IQR 6 · 3 – 13 · 2), compared with 7 · 9 % (4 · 9 – 13 · 9) for 16 <b>originator</b> <b>brands.</b> Interpretation: Although inflation-adjusted medicine prices were numerically lower, there were concerning decreases in availability of lowest-priced generic medicines in both the public and private sectors in 2012 from already low availability in 2010.

The Australian generics market remains underdeveloped due to a historical legacy of small Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme price differentials between <b>originator</b> <b>brands</b> and generics. It is argued that policy measures open to the Australian government can be conceived as clustering around two different approaches: incremental changes within the existing regulatory framework, or a shift towards a high volume/low price role of generics which would speed up the delivery of substantial cost savings, and could provide enhanced scope for the financing of new, patented drugs. <br /...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{study the}} health impact on adult New Zealand {{patients}} who switch from <b>originator</b> <b>brand</b> to generic venlafaxine. MethodsThe national pharmacy database {{was used to}} select patients using venlafaxine for at least 6 months. Switchers and nonswitchers were identified, and switch behavior was compared for a 12 -month follow-up period. Change in health service use following switching was also compared between switchers and nonswitchers including use of the emergency department, hospital, and specialist outpatient services over the same period. ResultsApproximately 12 % of all <b>originator</b> <b>brand</b> users switched to generic venlafaxine, {{at least half of}} whom continued to use the generic throughout the follow-up period to August 1, 2012. Almost 60 % of new users of the generic venlafaxine, however, switched to using the <b>originator</b> <b>brand.</b> Aside from a slight reduction in the use of outpatient services among switchers, {{there were no significant differences}} in health services use between switchers and nonswitchers for either existing or new venlafaxine users. ConclusionsAlthough both products remain fully subsidized and available, there is little incentive for prescribers, pharmacists, or patients to switch to the less expensive generic brand. If savings to the national New Zealand budget are to be realized, additional policy measures should be implemented to minimize incentives for multiple and reverse switching, and prescribers, as key opinion leaders, could take the lead in promoting generics to their patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: Increasing {{attention}} {{is being paid}} to the affordability of medicines in low- and middle-income countries (LICs and MICs) where medicines are often highly priced in relation to income levels. The impoverishing effect of medicine purchases can be estimated by determining pre- and postpayment incomes, which are then compared to a poverty line. Here we estimate the impoverishing effects of four medicines in 16 LICs and MICs using the impoverishment method as a metric of affordability. Methods and Findings: Affordability was assessed {{in terms of the}} proportion of the population being pushed below US$ 1. 25 or US$ 2 per day poverty levels because of the purchase of medicines. The prices of salbutamol 100 mcg/dose inhaler, glibenclamide 5 mg cap/tab, atenolol 50 mg cap/tab, and amoxicillin 250 mg cap/tab were obtained from facilitybased surveys undertaken using a standard measurement methodology. The World Bank’s World Development Indicators provided household expenditure data and information on income distributions. In the countries studied, purchasing these medicines would impoverish large portions of the population (up to 86 %). <b>Originator</b> <b>brand</b> products were less affordable than the lowest-priced generic equivalents. In the Philippines, for example, <b>originator</b> <b>brand</b> atenolol would push an additional 22 % of the population below US$ 1. 25 per day, whereas for the lowest priced generic equivalent this demographic shift is 7 %.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesIn low- {{and middle-income}} countries, {{patients}} and reimbursement agencies that purchase medicines {{in the private}} sector pay more for originator brands when generic equivalents exist. We estimated the savings that could be obtained from a hypothetical switch in medicine consumption from originator brands to lowest-priced generic equivalents for a selection of medicines in 17 countries. MethodsIn this cost minimization analysis, the prices of originator brands and their lowest-priced generic equivalents were obtained from facility-based surveys conducted by using a standard methodology. Fourteen medicines most commonly included in the surveys, plus three statins, were included in the analysis. For each medicine, the volume of private sector consumption of the <b>originator</b> <b>brand</b> product was obtained from IMS Health, Inc. Volumes were applied to the median unit prices for both originator brands and their lowest-priced generics to estimate cost savings. Prices were adjusted to 2008 by using consumer price index data and were adjusted for purchasing power parity. ResultsFor the medicines studied, an average of 9 % to 89 % could be saved by an individual country from a switch in private sector purchases from originator brands to lowest-priced generics. In public hospitals in China, US $ 370 million could be saved from switching only four medicines, saving an average of 65 %. Across individual medicines, average potential savings ranged from 11 % for beclometasone inhaler to 73 % for ceftriaxone injection. ConclusionsSubstantial savings could be achieved by switching private sector purchases from <b>originator</b> <b>brand</b> medicines to lowest-priced generic equivalents. Strategies to promote generic uptake, such as generic substitution by pharmacists and increasing confidence in generics by professionals and the public, should be included in national medicines policies...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) {{promotes}} {{the development of}} national Essential Medicines Lists (EMLs) {{in order to improve}} the availability and use of medicines considered essential within health care systems. However, despite over 3 decades of international efforts, studies show an inconsistent pattern in the availability of essential medicines. We evaluated and compared the availability of essential medicines, and medicines not included in national EMLs, at global and regional levels. METHODS: Medicine availability in the public and private sector were calculated based on data obtained from national and provincial facility-based surveys undertaken in 23 countries using the WHO/HAI methodology. The medicines were grouped according to their inclusion ('essential') or exclusion (termed 'non-essential') in each country's EML current {{at the time of the}} survey. Availability was calculated for <b>originator</b> <b>brands,</b> generics and any product type (<b>originator</b> <b>brands</b> or generics) and compared between the two groups. Results were aggregated by WHO regions, World Bank country income groups, a wealth inequality measure, and therapeutic groups. FINDINGS: Across all sectors and any product type, the median availability of essential medicines was suboptimal at 61 · 5 % (IQR 20 · 6 %- 86 · 7 %) but significantly higher than non-essential medicines at 27 · 3 % (IQR 3 · 6 %- 70 · 0 %). The median availability of essential medicines was 40 · 0 % in the public sector and 78 · 1 % in the private sector; compared to 6 · 6 % and 57 · 1 % for non-essential medicines respectively. A reverse trend between national income level categories and the availability of essential medicines was identified in the public sector. INTERPRETATION: EMLs have influenced the provision of medicines and have resulted in higher availability of essential medicines compared to non-essential medicines particularly in the public sector and in low and lower middle income countries. However, the availability of essential medicines, especially in the public sector does not ensure equitable access...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} health {{insurers}} have placed {{a great deal}} of emphasis on the ability of generic medicines to deliver significant savings to overstretched health care budgets due to their lower cost and potential for a more efficient resource allocation. In this paper we study market developments after patent expiry, whether health insurance captures the financial benefits from cheaper generics, and whether regulation and product differentiation, among others, have any power in explaining originator and generic price movements, generic entry and diffusion. We find that health insurance does not capitalize fully or fast enough on the cost advantage of generic medicines, either because generic policies do not encourage their fast uptake, or because generic drug prices are high and frequently tied, directly or indirectly, to originator drug prices. We also find that reference pricing, a particular form of reimbursement regulation, encourages generic entry and reduces generic prices but only marginally. Finally, in generic markets characterized by homogeneous products, we find evidence of product differentiation which is impacting prices upwards rather than downwards. If health insurance is to benefit fully from generic medicines, it ought to encourage faster uptake and price competition, and discourage price-fixing regulation that ties generic prices to those of <b>originator</b> <b>brands.</b> " Copyright (c) CEPR, CES, MSH, 2008. ...|$|R
30|$|The main {{sources of}} AEDs were private pharmacies. Three {{of the four major}} AEDs were available, but the stocks held were low. The {{financial}} burden for people with epilepsy was still important in the capital of Madagascar. This was mainly the consequence of a very developed private sector {{at the expense of the}} public sector, without any price regulation. <b>Originator</b> <b>brand</b> remained more expensive than generic, ranging from 1.3 to 5.3 higher. This result was less dramatic than data observed in a large survey conducted in 46 countries, where <b>originator</b> <b>brand</b> prices were about 30 times higher (Cameron et al. 2012). Furthermore, although sodium valproate remains the most expensive solution, it still remains the most available instead of phenobarbital. However, the most striking feature of this study concerns the cost of AEDs in the informal sector: patients use these outlets mostly because they are deemed to provide less costly drugs, but the opposite was observed in Madagascar. This results must be confirmed by further investigations in other sites but the illicit supply chain is difficult to assess. Selling points are often not officially known, and these information are often obtained by word of mouth. The methodology to measure the cost and availability of medicines by phone call, was easily and quickly implemented. The main limit of this method is due to the cross-sectional assessment, that provide information in a given position at a given time, that could not be the real availability at any moment. Anyway, it can provide a relevant and a comprehensive focus of the situation in a very large and crowded area with many points to be investigated and with a heavily congested and practically unusable road network. This epidemiological assessment provide data that could contribute to address the financial burden for people with epilepsy in the capital of Madagascar.|$|E

Policies implemented in the countries with a high rate of generic drug use, such as Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States, are reviewed, with consideration of the market structures that facilitate strong competition.

Their policy tools include the mix of supply-side measures and demand-side measures that are relevant for generic promotion and higher generic use. On the supply-side, key policy measures include generic drug marketing regulation that facilitates market entry soon after patent expiry, reference pricing, the pricing of <b>branded</b> <b>originator</b> products, and the degree of price competition in pharmaceuticalmarkets.

40|$|International audienceBackground: The {{prevalence}} of epilepsy {{is high in}} Madagascar (23. 5 / 1000), as is the treatment gap (estimated at 92 %). The health system {{of the country is}} underfunded; some AEDs are used, and the national drug policy does not encourage price regulation or the administration of generic agents. We conducted a cross‑sectional study to assess the availability and cost of solid oral AED formulations in Antananarivo, capital of Madagascar. Data were gathered from all officially registered pharmacies (according to the drug agency list, updated in 2015) by means of telephone interviews lasting no more than 10 min and conducted by a native Malagasy speaker. With regard to other sources (hospitals, illicit sales) data were obtained at specific visits. The study received ethical approval from the Madagascar Ministry of Health. Findings: A total of 91 of 100 pharmacies (the nine not included were because of an inoperative phone number), two of three public hospitals, and two illegal outlets were investigated. Sodium valproate was available in 84. 6 % of the pharmacies, while carbamazepine and phenobarbital were available in 68. 1 % and 36. 3 % of the pharmacies, respectively, but phenytoin was not available in any supply chain. There were more <b>originator</b> <b>brands</b> than generic for‑mulations, with a higher cost (range 20. 3 – 81. 1 %, median 40. 7 %) compared to the equivalent generic. The public sys‑tem had only a very limited choice of AED, but offered the lowest costs. Illicit sources were more expensive by 54. 3 % for carbamazepine and 62. 5 % for phenobarbital. Concerning the annual cost of treatment, the average percentage of the gross national income per capita based on the purchasing power parity was 29. 8 %/ 19. 0 % (brand/generic) for sodium valproate, 16. 4 %/ 7. 3 % (brand/generic) for carbamazepine, 8. 9 %/ 5. 1 % (brand/generic) for phenobarbital.

40|$|Generics are {{commonly}} accepted to {{contribute significantly to}} treating disease by improving the affordability of pharmaceuticals. Once the patent expires for an <b>originator</b> <b>brand,</b> generics erode prices through creating fierce competition. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate on Turkish pharmaceutical policies over generics through measuring how much they lower the prices, and then develop alternative strategies to maintain higher level of price reduction, and hence saving. Claims data from Turkish Social Security Institution (SSI) for all ambulatory care drugs reimbursed were collected monthly in the period of January 2009 to December 2013 and for selected 12 equivalent groups price erosion and saving impacts due to generic entry be computed. Moreover, the price erosion for 15 generics entering the reimbursement list in 2012 as first generics was measured. For 12 equivalent groups constituting nearly 7...|$|E
40|$|International {{comparisons}} While median medicine price ratios {{within a}} country can {{provide insight into}} the local medicine pricing policies, comparison with medicine prices in other countries can give further information and is particularly powerful in advocacy messages. Reliable evidence that the governments and/or populations of two similar countries are paying very different prices for the same medicine gives advocates and policymakers in the higher-price country a chance to examine the underlying reasons and to identify ways of obtaining lower prices. Chapter 10 offers suggestions on how international price differences can give clues to possible lines of action to reduce medicine prices. International comparisons must be undertaken carefully so that valid similarities and differences between like products in like sectors can be identifi ed. The data that you and others using this manual have collected enable international comparisons to be made of: � the availability and prices of individual <b>originator</b> <b>brand</b> or generic medicines fro...|$|E
40|$|Executive summary Background: A {{field study}} {{to measure the}} price, availability, {{affordability}} and price components of selected medicines was undertaken in Burkina Faso in July 19 th to August 8 th 2009 using a standardized methods developed by the World Health Organization and Health Action International (WHO/HAI). Methods: The survey of medicine prices and availability was conducted in six health districts: Boulmiougou, Do, Dedougou, Tenkodogo, Boulsa and Orodara. Data on fifty (50) medicines was collected in thirty one (31) public, thirty four (34) private and forty two (42) mission sector medicine outlets, selected using a validated sampling frame. Data was also collected on public and private procurement prices. For each medicine in the survey, data was collected for the <b>originator</b> <b>brand</b> and lowest priced generic equivalent (generic product with the lowest price at each facility).

40|$|The {{bioengineered}} {{tissue plasminogen}} activator tenecteplase is an important treatment modality of acute myocardial infarction recommended by international guidelines. Following introduction of <b>originator</b> tenecteplase (<b>brand</b> names Metalyse® and TNKase®), a ‘biosimilar’ tenecteplase became available for commercial use in India under the brand name Elaxim® {{in the absence of}} Indian biosimilar guidelines which came into force from September 15 th, 2012. Based on a report of biochemical and fibrinolytical differences between Metalyse and Elaxim, we have systematically compared them in a range of routine quality testing assays. As compared to Metalyse, Elaxim exhibited less clot lysis activity and contained less of the two-chain form of tenecteplase. Even upon full in vitro conversion to the two-chain form Elaxim exhibited less clot lysis activity. This was linked to differences in sialic acid content and glycosylation pattern with Elaxim exhibiting less bi- and more tetra-antennary glycosylation, leading to different charge heterogeneity profile. Regarding purity, Elaxim contained more tenecteplase aggregates and, in contrast to Metalyse, considerable amounts of Chinese hamster ovary cell protein. Taken together these data demonstrate that Metalyse and Elaxim differ considerably in clot lysis activity and biochemical properties. These data question whether Elaxim indeed can be considered a ‘biosimilar’ of Metalyse, i. e. whether and to which extent the clinical efficacy and safety properties of Metalyse can be extrapolated to Elaxim in the absence of comparative clinical data...|$|R

40|$|The Philippines {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} {{pharmaceutical}} markets in the ASEAN region, next only to Indonesia and Thailand. It is a lifeline to thousands of Filipino workers and a significant contributor in terms of value of output. This industry {{is one of the}} fastest growing industries in the country. Meanwhile, its output, drugs and medicines, account for 46 percent of the total medical out-of-pocket expenses of Philippine households. For poorer people, this percentage goes up to 55 percent. Making essential drugs and medicines more affordable especially to the poor and underserved is one of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is therefore essential to examine the profile of the pharmaceutical industry in the country to better understand the supply chain of drugs and medicines for policy formulation purposes. Using administrative data from agencies that have regulative powers over the industry, a profile of the Philippine pharmaceutical industry was developed. As of December 2009, the Food and Drug Administration 28 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s records show that there are 284 drug manufacturers, 438 drug traders, 634 drug importers, 4, 719 drug distributors of which 3, 956 are wholesalers, and 32, 538 retail outlets.

40|$|BACKGROUND. Community-acquired {{bacterial}} meningitis (CABM) is a life-threatening condition that is common among immunocompromised individuals. Intravenous ceftriaxone, of which Rocephin (ROC) is the <b>originator</b> <b>brand,</b> is recommended as first-line therapy in South Africa. Despite concerns regarding therapeutic equivalence with generic agents, {{this is the}} first study that has been conducted comparing clinical pharmacokinetics (PK) of a generic ceftriaxone formulation with the originator. OBJECTIVE. To compare the PK and safety of Aspen Ceftriaxone (AC) and ROC in the treatment of adult CABM. METHODS. A total of 63 eligible patients were randomised 1 : 1 to receive 2 g of either medication twice daily for a duration based on the identity of the causative organism and their physician’s clinical judgment. The primary endpoint of this study was the comparison of clinical PK, specifically the concentrations of each drug in the cerebrospinal fluid with corresponding paired plasma samples. While this study was underpowered to assess efficacy, safety could be evaluated on the basis of reported adverse events. RESULTS. The two patient groups were epidemiologically similar. There were no statistically significant differences in PK between either agent, nor any difference with regard to safety. CONCLUSION. AC can be considered as equivalent to ROC with regard to PK and safety in patients with CABM. Aspen Pharmacare Ltd, SA. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{global burden}} of {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD) continues to rise. Successful treatment of CVD requires adequate pharmaceutical management. The aim {{was to examine the}} availability, pricing and affordability of cardiovascular medicines in developing countries using the standardized data collected according to the World Health Organization/Health Action International methodology. Methods The following medicines were included: atenolol, captopril, hydrochlorothiazide, losartan and nifedipine. Data from 36 countries were analyzed. Outcome measures were percentage availability, price ratios to international reference prices and number of day's wages needed by the lowest-paid unskilled government worker to purchase one month of chronic treatment. Patient prices were adjusted for inflation and purchasing power, procurement prices only for inflation. Data were analyzed for both generic and <b>originator</b> <b>brand</b> products and the public and private sector and summarized by World Bank Income Groups. Results For all measures, there was great variability across surveys. The overall availability of cardiovascular medicines was poor (mean 26. 3 % in public sector, 57. 3 % private sector). Procurement prices were very competitive in some countries, whereas others consistently paid high prices. Patient prices were generally substantially higher than international references prices; some countries, however, performed well. Chronic treatment with anti-hypertensive medication cost more than one day's wages in many cases. In particular when monotherapy is insufficient, treatment became unaffordable. Conclusions The results of this study emphasize the need of focusing attention and financing on making chronic disease medicines accessible, in particular in the public sector. Several policy options are suggested to reach this goal. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Medicines play an {{important}} role in healthcare, but prices can be a barrier to patient care. Few studies have looked at the prices of essential medicines in low- and middle-income countries in terms of patient affordability. Aim: To determine the prices, availability and affordability of medicines along the supply chain in Swaziland. Setting: Private- and public-sector facilities in Manzini, Swaziland. Methods: The standardised methodology designed by the World Health Organization and Health Action International was used to survey 16 chronic disease medicines. Data were collected in one administrative area in 10 private retail pharmacies and 10 public health facilities. <b>Originator</b> <b>brand</b> (OB) and lowest-priced generic equivalent (LPG) medicines were monitored and these prices were then compared with international reference prices (IRPs). Affordability was calculated in terms of the daily wage of the lowest-paid unskilled government worker. Results: Mean availability was 68 % in the public sector. Private sector OB medicines were priced 32. 4 times higher than IRPs, whilst LPGs were 7. 32 times higher. OBs cost 473 % more than LPGs. The total cumulative mark-ups for individual medicines range from 190. 99 % – 440. 27 %. The largest contributor to add-on cost was the retail mark-up (31 % – 53 %). Standard treatment with originator brands cost more than a day’s wage. Conclusion: Various policy measures such as introducing price capping at all levels of the medicine supply chain, may increase the availability, whilst at the same time reducing the prices of essential medicines for the low income population. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{characterize}} {{the patterns of}} competition for a sample of drugs in the Portuguese pharmaceutical market before (January 2002 -March 2003) and after (April 2003 -June 2003) {{the introduction of the}} reference pricing system (RPS). Methods We performed a descriptive, retrospective, longitudinal analysis, with monthly observations from January 2002 until June 2003 of 15 homogeneous groups. The groups represented the upper limit of public pharmaceutical expenditure in the RPS segment in 2003 (n = 270). Measures of competition were: 1) number of presentations; 2) prescriptions’ concentration in the generic and <b>originator</b> (<b>brand)</b> segments, using Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI); and 3) dominant positions of market leader in the homogeneous group. A correlation analysis between the number of presentations, the HHI, and the dominant position of the market leader was performed using Pearson coefficient of correlation. Results The structure of the market changed with the introduction of RPS. We found an increasing number of generic presentations (from 4 ± 3 to 7 ± 4; mean ± standard deviation) and a decrease in the HHI for the generics market segment (from 0. 7 ± 0. 2 to 0. 6 ± 0. 3). There was a negative correlation between those variables that increased after the introduction of RPS (from - 0. 6 to - 0. 8). The HHI for brands and the dominant positions remained unchanged. Conclusion After the implementation of RPS, the increased competition was mainly driven by economic and social agents in the generics market segment but not in the brands market segment...|$|E
40|$|You {{may begin}} {{detailed}} planning {{of the survey}} after attaining {{a thorough understanding of}} the national pharmaceutical sector and obtaining the necessary human, technical and financial resources required to carry it out. Chapter 3 describes the various activities required to create a country-specific survey design based on the standard methodology. This effort involves: � identifying the regions in which to conduct the survey (‘survey areas’); � identifying the sectors to include in the survey (‘sectors’); � developing the sample of medicine dispensing points to survey for each sector (‘medicine outlets’); � finalizing the list of medicines to be surveyed; and � for each medicine to be surveyed, identifying the <b>originator</b> <b>brand</b> product and manufacturer (lowest-priced generic products will be identified at individual medicine outlets). Once the various elements of the survey design have been developed, a survey protocol should be prepared and sent to HAI 1 or WHO 2 for review prior to starting the survey. The Survey Protocol template is provided on the accompanying CD-ROM. Meaningful survey results depend on an appropriate survey design. This requires strict adherence to the medicine price survey standard methodology and process, as well as careful consideration of the national pharmaceutical situation. It is essential to follow the survey methodology, particularly the sampling methods. 3. 1 Determining the survey scope 3. 1. 1 Planning where to conduct the study – national or regional?

40|$|This paper evaluates {{medicine}} prices, their {{availability and}} affordability in Brazil, considering the differences across {{three types of}} medicines on the market (originator brands, generics and similar medicines) and different types of facilities (private pharmacies, public sector pharmacies and “popular pharmacies”), using an established methodology. Data on prices and availability of 50 medicines (<b>originator</b> <b>brand,</b> lowestpriced generic and similar medicines) were collected from public, private and popular pharmacies (N= 56) across six cities in Southern Brazil. Median prices obtained are divided by international reference prices to derive the median price ratio (MPR). In the private sector, prices were 8. 6 MPR for similar medicines, 11. 3 MRP for generics and 18. 7 MRP for originator brands, respectively. Mean availability was 65 %, 74 % and 48 % for originator brands, generics and similars, respectively. The number of working days needed {{to pay for a}} complete medicine treatment (affordability) varied considerably between medicines aimed at treating acute and chronic diseases and by type of medicine. In the public sector, the mean availability of similar medicines was 2 - 7 times higher than that of generics. The mean overall availability in the public sector ranged from 68. 8 % to 81. 7 %. In “popular pharmacies”, mean availability was greater than 90 % in all cities. This analysis finds that availability of medicines in the public sector does not meet the challenge for supplying essential medicines to the entire population, as stated in the Brazilian constitution. This has unavoidable repercussions for affordability, particularly amongst the lower socio-economic strata. Policies targeted to reduce the prices of the generics need to be implemented in Brazil, as well as making them more widely available. Popular pharmacies may help overcome the lack of medicines in the public sector, but the limited number of medicines distributed in these facilities is of concern...|$|E
