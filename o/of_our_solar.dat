Rather than evolving to a planet composed mainly of rock with a thin atmosphere, the small rocky core remains engulfed by its large hydrogen-rich envelope.|$|E

25|$|Presolar {{stardust}} grains formed within outflowing {{and cooling}} gases from earlier presolar stars. The stellar nucleosynthesis {{that took place}} within each presolar star gives to each granule an isotopic composition unique to that parent star, which differs from the isotopic composition <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>solar</b> system's matter {{as well as from}} the galactic average. These isotopic signatures often fingerprint very specific astrophysical nuclear processes that took place within the parent star and prove their presolar origin.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{principle}} for the starship {{and the space}} ritual {{is based on the}} Pythagorean concept of sound.

Along this string were positioned the planets <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>solar</b> system. Each of these spheres as it rushed through space was believed to sound a certain tone caused by its continuous displacement of the ether. These intervals and harmonies are called 'The Sound Of The Spheres.' The interval between Earth and the fixed stars being the most perfect harmonic interval.|$|E

25|$|Possible {{acute and}} late {{risks to the}} CNS from galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and solar proton events (SPEs) are a {{documented}} concern for human exploration <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>solar</b> system. In the past, the risks to the CNS of adults {{who were exposed to}} low to moderate doses of ionizing radiation (0 to 2 Gy (Gray) (Gy = 100 rad)) have not been a major consideration. However, the heavy ion component of space radiation presents distinct biophysical challenges to cells and tissues as compared to the physical challenges that are presented by terrestrial forms of radiation. Soon after the discovery of cosmic rays, the concern for CNS risks originated with the prediction of the light flash phenomenon from single HZE nuclei traversals of the retina; this phenomenon was confirmed by the Apollo astronauts in 1970 and 1973. HZE nuclei are capable of producing a column of heavily damaged cells, or a microlesion, along their path through tissues, thereby raising concern over serious impacts on the CNS. In recent years, other concerns have arisen with the discovery of neurogenesis and its impact by HZE nuclei, which have been observed in experimental models of the CNS.|$|E

40|$|This article relates two {{topics of}} central {{importance}} in modern astronomy - the discovery some {{fifteen years ago}} of the first planets around other stars (exoplanets), and the centuries-old problem of understanding the origin <b>of</b> <b>our</b> own <b>solar</b> system, with its planets, planetary satellites, asteroids, and comets.

2500|$|Velikovsky {{arrived at}} these {{proposals}} using a methodology which would today be called comparative mythology - {{he looked for}} concordances in myths and written history of unconnected cultures across the world, following a literal reading of their accounts of the exploits of planetary deities. In this book, he argues {{on the basis of}} ancient cosmological myths from places as disparate as India and China, Greece and Rome, Assyria and Sumer. For example, ancient Greek mythology asserts that the goddess Athena sprang from the head of Zeus. Velikovsky identifies Zeus (whose Roman counterpart was the god Jupiter) with the planet Jupiter and Athena (the Roman Minerva) with the planet Venus. This myth, along with others from ancient Egypt, Israel, Mexico, etc. are used to support the claim that [...] "Venus was expelled as a comet and then changed to a planet after contact with a number of members <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>solar</b> system" [...] (Velikovsky 1972:182).|$|E
2500|$|Although in {{previous}} centuries noted astronomers were exclusively male, {{at the turn}} of the 20th century women began to play a role in the great discoveries.

[...] A number of discoveries in this period were originally noted by the women [...] "computers" [...] and reported to their supervisors. For example, at the Harvard Observatory Henrietta Swan Leavitt discovered the cepheid variable star period-luminosity relation which she further developed into a method of measuring distance outside <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>solar</b> system.

2500|$|The Sun (...) is {{the ruling}} planet of Leo and is exalted in Aries. In Greek mythology, the Sun was {{represented}} by the Titans Hyperion and Helios (Roman Sol, and later by Apollo, the god of light). The Sun is the star at the center <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>solar</b> system, around which the Earth and other planets revolve and provides us with heat and light. The arc that the Sun travels in every year, rising and setting {{in a slightly different}} place each day, is therefore in reality a reflection of the Earth's own orbit around the Sun. This arc is larger the farther north or south from the equator latitude, giving a more extreme difference between day and night and between seasons during the year. The Sun travels through the twelve signs of the zodiac on its annual journey, spending about a month in each. The Sun's position on a person's birthday therefore determines what is usually called his or her [...] "sun" [...] sign. However, the sun sign allotment varies between Western (sign change around 22-23 of every month) and Hindu astrology (sign change around 14-15 of every month) due the different systems of planetary calculations, following the tropical and sidereal definitions respectively.|$|E
