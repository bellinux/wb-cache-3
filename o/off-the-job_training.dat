40|$|Pre-apprenticeships, preparatory <b>training</b> <b>off-the-job</b> {{for entry}} into apprenticeships, have been in {{existence}} for several decades. Depending on the prevailing economic conditions, they {{have been asked to}} serve two major purposes: as labour market programs to discipline young unemployed people into the regime of study and work, and as one means of solving skill shortage problems in particular industries or the traditional trades in general. Research has previously focused mainly on their roles in succeeding in these purposes. There has, however, been little empirical research into the experiences of the participants themselves. This paper reports on part of a national project on pre-apprenticeships carried out during 2005 - 6.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this current study are twofold. First, inspired by data emerging from the United Kingdom and Australia, we seek to confirm whether the incidence of training was higher for US women than for US men during the 1990 s. Second, we explore {{the relationship between the}} comparatively greater incidence of training for women and occupational segregation. Our data confirm that overall levels of training participation were higher for women than for men in 1995. Further, when training is broken down by type, women also participated more than men did in the three possible categories: on-the-job training, employer-supported <b>off-the-job</b> <b>training,</b> and <b>off-the-job</b> <b>training</b> without employer support. These results challenge conventional expectations derived from human capital theory. Finally, our estimates indicate that occupational segregation accounted for {{more than one-third of the}} gender differences in training in 1995 and for more than 40 percent in on-the-job and employer-supported, <b>off-the-job</b> <b>training</b> categories.

40|$|The continual {{separation}} of training into its on-the-job and off-the-job components is counterproductive. It over-emphasises where learning takes place {{rather than focusing}} {{on the quality of the}} experience. It works against the effective integration of learning and assessment in VET and reinforces perceptions that some training outcomes are somehow of lesser value. The majority of training provision relies heavily on the assessment of people performing simulated work tasks because issues of access and cost make assessment of the performance of real work totally impractical. However, carefully constructed problem-based simulations that mirror real units of work can effectively bridge the gap between the on- and <b>off-the-job</b> components of <b>training.</b> The case study included in this paper is an example of such a "meta-simulation". It requires students to apply a range of high level skills and knowledge to complex work-related tasks and to present their outcomes to a panel of teachers and industry experts for assessment.

40|$|Apprenticeship {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} forms of {{training}} and {{is one of the}} cornerstones on which a skills bank is built. It has been developed from a system of master and indentured apprentice, which existed in the period of the medieval guilds, to a dual system of education and training with both on-the-job and <b>off-the-job</b> periods of <b>training</b> and education. A number of unsuccessful attempts were made in the last century to re-structure apprenticeship in Ireland, including three Acts of the Oireachtas (Parliament). Despite this legislation, the only requirement to qualify as a craftsperson was to serve the appropriate length of time and to be a member of the craft union. There were no mandatory levels of competence to be reached by the apprentice before being recognised as a craftsperson. In 1991, the social partners agreed the need for an overhaul of the apprenticeship system and set in motion the process to develop an apprenticeship system that would ensure that all apprentices in the designated trades would have to reach predetermined standards on competence before they could be awarded the National Craft Certificate. The new system is modular in structure and known as the Standards Based Apprenticeship. This thesis examined the effectiveness of the Standards Based Apprenticeship system in meeting the present and future needs of the construction industry and in preparing apprentices to adapt to inevitable change in the industry. It concludes that the new system is superior to the time-served system it replaced in many respects but has identified some problems. The thesis concludes by making some recommendations for change to the system, based on the analysis of the responses from the stakeholders and which, if implemented, would in the opinion of the author, ensure that the Irish crafts persons are trained to the highest international standards.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} impact of journalism {{training}} on journalists' experiences of their occupation {{and its implications for}} the news industry in the present volatile economic environment. It examines to what extent training empowers current journalists to adapt to the fast changing news world in order to guarantee the improvement of journalistic quality and to further serve a vital democratic function in our society. Using the example of Switzerland, this study focuses on the industry-oriented model of <b>off-the-job</b> <b>training</b> operated by MAZ, The Swiss School of Journalism. In total, 30 one-on-one in-depth interviews with trainee journalists attending the two-year Certificate Course in Journalism were conducted and thematically analysed by means of a specific matrix-based method for ordering and synthesising the data. The findings show that journalists who have experienced <b>off-the-job</b> <b>training</b> act more self-consciously in journalism practice as a result of regular information exchange and networking with co-trainees and lecturers, provided that the practical value of classroom expertise matches the editorial principles in force in their newsrooms. <b>Off-the-job</b> <b>training</b> increases journalists' employability regarding their personal, analytical, narrative and technical competencies and provides the bedrock for developing self-interested behaviour. Journalists trained within an industry-driven system seem more likely to predominantly think and act in an industry-minded manner, which eventually supports their employability and enables the news industry to reproduce itself. On a larger scale, the findings exemplify that the latest generation of news manufacturers no longer seeks control over occupational jurisdiction in the first instance, but strives for the improvement of employability instead. This study argues that 24 / 7 news production supported by a closely tied model of training is hardly able to recalibrate journalism's traditional, but dwindling, mission to above all serve a democratic function in our society. Claiming that the supervision of journalism is too important to be left to the journalism industry, it calls for measures to be taken from a broader social and political scope...|$|E

The 'Learning and Training at Work' surveys, which commenced in 1999, are an annual series of employer surveys that investigate the provision of learning and training at work. The surveys also investigate awareness of, and involvement with, a number of existing and new training and development initiatives. Learning and training information had previously been collected, along with information on recruitment difficulties, skill shortages and skill gaps, in the annual 'Skill Needs in Britain' (SNIB) surveys, which were carried out between 1990 and 1998 (these surveys are not currently held at UKDA). The objectives of the 'Learning and Training at Work' survey series are to collect information about: key indicators of employers' commitment to training, such as the Investors in People award; the volume, type and pattern of <b>off-the-job</b> <b>training</b> provided; learning opportunities offered; awareness of, and involvement with, a number of initiatives relevant to training; {{the costs associated with}} the provision of training.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of Natal, Durban, 2002. This study {{explores the}} views of {{managers}} of Police Stations and trainees in one of forty-two (42) Policing Areas in the South African Police Service. It probes {{the feelings of the}} managers (herein referred to as Station Commissioners) and trainees regarding training methods used during In-service training. The study starts by analysing the environment in which the SAPS operates. The Management Problem identified is the lack of transfer of training at station level. This problem exists in the SAPS at the time when it grapples with transforming from a militaristic form to a service organisation. It is the time when the organization's training interventions are very critical for their members to providing better service. In finding out {{the views of}} Station Commissioners and trainees, a communication survey was conducted in all police stations found in the Pretoria Area. A questionnaire was administered to two groups from this Area. One was a group of Station Commissioners and the other made of trainees that attended training programmes at least twelve months before the survey. The questionnaire consisted of instruments probing views on <b>off-the-job</b> <b>training</b> and on-the-job-training methods as well as organisational climate instrument. The organizational climate instrument was a modified version of Likert & Likert (1976) scale. The trainees and Station Commissioners positively viewed goal setting and decision-making at these police stations. Leadership, motivation and communication were the dimensions of organisational climate that need improvement or reinforcement. Both methods of training, that is off- and on-the-job, were deemed necessary in the SAPS. The act of travelling long distances before the training was identified as a problem for <b>off-the-job</b> <b>training.</b> It was also highlighted that both methods are necessary for all members regardless of their level of skills or position...|$|E
40|$|Retraining {{the labor}} force to match {{the demands of a}} modem economy is seen as an {{important}} task during the transition process from a centrally-planned to a market economy. This need was particularly pressing in East Germany, because the transition process has proceeded much faster than in the rest of Eastern Europe. Therefore, substantial resources have been devoted to this purpose. This paper analyzes the impact of continuous <b>off-the-job</b> <b>training</b> in East Germany {{from the point of view}} of individuals who were part of {{the labor force}} before German unification in 1990. It tries to answer questions about the average gains from participating in a specific type of training. Typical outcomes considered to measure those gains are income, employment status, job security, and expected future changes in job position. The methodology used for the evaluation is the potential outcome approach to causality. This approach has received considerable attention in the statistical literature over the last fifteen years and it has recently been rediscovered by the econometric literature as well. It is adapted to allow for important permanent and transitory shocks, such as unemployment, which influence the decision to participate in the training as well as future labor market outcomes. The empirical part is based on the first four waves of the Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) -East (1990 - 1993). This panel data set has the advantage that the fourth wave contains a special survey on continuous training and that it allows keeping track of individual behavior on a monthly, respectively yearly, basis.
