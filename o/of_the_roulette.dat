The computer was concealable, designed to be invisible to an onlooker. It was small enough to fit inside a shoe. The data was input by tapping the big toe on a micro-switch in the shoe. Then an electronic signal was relayed to a vibrotactile output system hidden behind the shirt, strapped to the chest, which had three solenoid actuators near the stomach which would indicate by vibrating either which of the eight octants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roulette</b> wheel to place a bet on, or a ninth possibility: not to place a bet.|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} research, {{selection}} of a clothes design (chromosome) is made by a rotating wheel called Roulette wheel and based on maximum fitness. <b>The</b> <b>Roulette</b> wheel functions as following.

A circle is considered and divided into parts equal to clothes designs such that each part is related to <b>the</b> fitness degree <b>of</b> a clothes design. The wheel is rotated and everywhere is stopped, on looks at the wheel index and selects a clothes design related to the part. Therefore, every member having more fitness will have more chance. With each rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wheel, a design is selected and {{is affected by the}} crossover and or mutation operators to produce next generation as parents. Selection <b>of</b> parents by <b>the</b> <b>Roulette</b> wheel is shown in Fig.  4 d.|$|R

5000|$|Thorp {{refers to}} himself as the {{inventor}} of the first [...] "wearable computer" [...] In other variations, the system was a concealed cigarette-pack sized analog computer designed to predict the motion of roulette wheels.

The system was successfully tested in Las Vegas in June 1961, but hardware issues with the speaker wires prevented it from being used beyond test runs. This was not a wearable computer, because it could not be re-purposed during use; rather it was an example of task-specific hardware.

40|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major {{difficulties}} in software testing is <b>the</b> automatic generation <b>of</b> test data that satisfy a given adequacy criterion. This paper presents an automatic test data generation technique {{that uses a}} genetic algorithm (GA), which is guided by the data flow dependencies in the program, to search for test data to cover its def-use associations. The GA conducts its search by constructing new test data from previously generated test data that are evaluated as effective test data. The approach {{can be used in}} test data generation for programs with/without loops and procedures. The proposed GA accepts as input an instrumented version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program to be tested, <b>the</b> list <b>of</b> defuse associations to be covered, <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> input variables, and the domain and precision of each input variable. The algorithm produces a set <b>of</b> test cases, <b>the</b> set <b>of</b> def-use associations covered by each test case, and a list of uncovered defuse associations, if any.
