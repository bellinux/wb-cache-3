We recognize and applaud the thoughtful and painstaking efforts, over many years, of Judge Neil P. McCurn, who presided over this and related land claims in upstate New York with fairness and due regard to the rights and interests of all parties as well as with a keen appreciation of the complexities of the subject matter and of the relevant law. <b>Our</b> <b>decision</b> is based on a subsequent ruling by the Supreme Court, which could not be anticipated by Judge McCurn in his handling of this case over more than twenty years.|$|E

25|$|The fuzzy logical {{theory of}} speech {{perception}} developed by Dominic Massaro proposes that people remember speech sounds in a probabilistic, or graded, way. It suggests that people remember {{descriptions of the}} perceptual units of language, called prototypes. Within each prototype various features may combine. However, features are not just binary (true or false), there is a fuzzy value corresponding to how {{likely it is that}} a sound belongs to a particular speech category. Thus, when perceiving a speech signal <b>our</b> <b>decision</b> about what we actually hear is based on the relative goodness of the match between the stimulus information and values of particular prototypes. The final decision is based on multiple features or sources of information, even visual information (this explains the McGurk effect). Computer models of the fuzzy logical theory have been used to demonstrate that the theory's predictions of how speech sounds are categorized correspond to the behavior of human listeners.|$|E

40|$|In the article, I {{will argue}} that {{metacognition}} {{plays an important role}} in decision - making not only as direct online monitoring and control of decision - making processes but also by enabling us to influence <b>our</b> <b>decisions</b> and actions – and m e n tal states and processes, related to them – i n an offline manner. That is, offline metacognition allows us to observe, refer to and, to a certain degree, exert influence on me n tal states and proce sses related to <b>our</b> <b>decisions</b> and actions in the way of be ing removed, decoupled from the task/decision at hand and present time demands. As such, it enable s us to observe, f orm thoughts and have feelings about me n tal states and processes directly related to <b>our</b> future <b>decisions,</b> to plan <b>our</b> future <b>decisions,</b> to reflect on our past choices, and to think and have feelings about our broader goals, desires, and personal values that are indirectly related to <b>our</b> <b>decisions.</b> To illustrate the importance of offline metacognition in decision - making, I will firstly review and discuss some experimental findings on implementation intentions (“ decisions about the future”) and anticipated emotions (beliefs about future emotional states related to outcomes of <b>our</b> <b>decisions).</b> Secondly, I {{will argue that}} our ability to reflect (t hink and feel) on our broader goals, desires and personal values – that represent a kind of structure into which <b>our</b> specific <b>decisions</b> are embedded – reveals how offline metacognition can exert influence on <b>our</b> <b>decisions</b> also in an indirect way. All in al l, I will try to show that our ability to refer to our own minds in an offline way – be it to mental states and processes directly or indirectly related to specific decisions – is essential for us to decide, as we decide, and act, as we act...|$|R

500|$|The Secret River {{appeared}} {{two years}} after Rawlings' death with illustrations by the 1948 Caldecott Medal winner Leonard Weisgard, who used coffee-coloured paper as an innovative way to circumvent a taboo of the era against portraying dark-skinned characters. In his book In the Company of Writers, Charles Scribner discusses The Secret Rivers publication, noting Rawlings never mentions Calpurnia's race. Since the book went into production after her death Rawlings could not be consulted about her final intentions. At this time the depiction of black children in American children's literature had decreased until it was almost non-existent. While a few books were still appearing, [...] "White (children's) publishers were still not open to books with Black themes", according to Joyce Braden Harris on [...] "African and African-American Traditions in Language Arts". Scribner pointed out that [...] "Whatever <b>our</b> <b>decision,</b> we could land {{on the wrong side}} of the school boards", and claims the idea for using dark paper in the book as a way to suggest Calpurnia's race was his, calling it [...] "one of my silent contributions to dissolving the color barrier in the 1950s." [...] The book received a Newbery Honor Award in 1956 for [...] "the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children", and was honored by the American Society of Graphic Arts.|$|E

2500|$|Two working {{principles}} underlie <b>our</b> <b>decision</b> in Twombly. First, the tenet that a court {{must accept}} as true {{all of the}} allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions. ... Second, only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss. Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will, as the Court of Appeals observed, be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense. ... In keeping with these principles a court considering a motion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying pleadings that, because they {{are no more than}} conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth. While legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be supported by factual allegations. When there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. <b>Our</b> <b>decision</b> in Twombly illustrates the two-pronged approach.|$|E
