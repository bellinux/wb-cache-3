5|$|The nuclear {{membrane}} contains a lipid bilayer that encompass {{the contents of}} the nucleus. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a synthesis and transport <b>organelle</b> that branches into the cytoplasm in plant and animal cells. The Golgi apparatus is a series of multiple compartments where molecules are packaged for delivery to other cell components or for secretion from the cell. Vacuoles, which are found in both plant and animal cells (though much bigger in plant cells), are responsible for maintaining the shape and structure of the cell as well as storing waste products. A vesicle is a relatively small, membrane-enclosed sac that stores or transports substances. The cell membrane is a protective barrier that regulates what enters and leaves the cell. There is also an <b>organelle</b> known as the Spitzenkörper that is only found in fungi, and is connected with hyphal tip growth.|$|E
5|$|The nucleus is an <b>organelle</b> {{found in}} {{eukaryotic}} cells. Inside its fully enclosed nuclear membrane, it contains {{the majority of}} the cell's genetic material. This material is organized as DNA molecules, along with a variety of proteins, to form chromosomes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} whether microtubule-directed transport of vesicular <b>organelles</b> depends on the presence of a pool of cytosolic factors, including soluble motor proteins and accessory factors. Earlier studies with squid axon <b>organelles</b> (Schroer et al., 1988) suggested that the presence of cytosol induces a> 20 -fold {{increase in the number of}} <b>organelles</b> moving per unit time on microtubules in vitro. These earlier studies, however, did not consider that cytosol might nonspecifically increase the numbers of moving <b>organelles,</b> i. e., by blocking adsorption of <b>organelles</b> to the coverglass. Here we report that treatment of the coverglass with casein, in the absence of cytosol, blocks adsorption of <b>organelles</b> to the coverglass and results in vigorou...|$|R
50|$|Mechanisms {{of protein}} sorting and {{retrieval}} {{have been found}} to give <b>organelles</b> their characteristic composition. It is known that cellular <b>organelles</b> can come from preexisting organelles; however, it is a subject of controversy whether <b>organelles</b> can be created without a preexisting one.|$|R
40|$|Conventional <b>organelles</b> {{multiply}} {{themselves through}} rounds of proliferation and fission of pre-existing <b>organelles.</b> The <b>organelles</b> of the endomembrane system, {{such as the}} endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus, are dynamically maintained by mutual retro- and anterograde transport. During cell division, resident <b>organelles</b> are divided and inherited equally between the daughter cells. According to these schemes, the formation of <b>organelles</b> requires a pre-existing structure to which new membranes fuse, and such membrane structures are propagated as long as cell division continues. How, then, is a membrane structure formed that is destined to be degraded along with any such pre-existing structures...|$|R
5|$|Bacteria like archaea are prokaryotic – unicelluar, {{and having}} no cell nucleus or other membrane-bound <b>organelle.</b> Bacteria are microscopic, {{with a few}} {{extremely}} rare exceptions, such as Thiomargarita namibiensis. Bacteria function and reproduce as individual cells, but they can often aggregate in multicellular colonies. Some species such as myxobacteria can aggregate into complex swarming structures, operating as multicellular groups {{as part of their}} life cycle, or form clusters in bacterial colonies such as E.coli.|$|E
5|$|In {{mammalian}} cells, {{the average}} {{diameter of the}} nucleus is approximately 6 micrometres (µm), which occupies about 10% of the total cell volume. The viscous liquid within it is called nucleoplasm (or karyolymph), and is similar in composition to the cytosol found outside the nucleus. It appears as a dense, roughly spherical or irregular <b>organelle.</b> The composition by dry weight of the nucleus is approximately: DNA 9%, RNA 1%, Histone Protein 11%, Residual Protein 14%, Acidic Proteins 65%.|$|E
5|$|Most {{living things}} that are {{visible to the naked}} eye in their adult form are eukaryotes, {{including}} humans. However, a large number of eukaryotes are also microorganisms. Unlike bacteria and archaea, eukaryotes contain organelles such as the cell nucleus, the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria in their cells. The nucleus is an <b>organelle</b> that houses the DNA that makes up a cell's genome. DNA (Deoxyribonuclaic acid) itself is arranged in complex chromosomes.|$|E
50|$|Differential Centrifugation {{is a type}} of {{centrifugation}} {{in which}} one selectively spins down components of a mixture by a series of increasing centrifugation forces. This method is commonly used to separate <b>organelles</b> and membranes found in cells. <b>Organelles</b> generally differ from each other in density in size, making the use of differential centrifugation, and centrifugation in general, possible. The <b>organelles</b> can then be identified by testing for indicators that are unique to the specific <b>organelles.</b>|$|R
40|$|Biochemical, {{pharmacological}} and immunocytochemical {{studies have}} implicated the microtubule-activated ATPase, kinesin, {{in the movement}} of membrane bounded <b>organelles</b> in fast axonal transport. In vitro studies suggested that kinesin moves <b>organelles</b> preferentially in the anterograde direction, but data about the function and precise localization of kinesin in the living axon were lacking. The current study was undertaken to establish whether kinesin associates with anterograde or retrograde moving <b>organelles</b> in vivo. Peripheral nerves were ligated to produce accumulations of <b>organelles</b> moving in defined directions. Regions proximal (anterograde) and distal (retrograde) to the ligation were analyzed for kinesin localization by immunofluorescence, and by immunogold electron microscopy using ultracryomicrotomy. Substantial amounts of kinesin were associated with anterograde moving <b>organelles</b> on the proximal side, while significantly less kinesin was detected distally. Statistical analyses indicated that kinesin was mostly associated with membrane-bounded <b>organelles.</b> These observations indicate that axonal kinesin is primarily associated with anterograde moving <b>organelles</b> in vivo...|$|R
40|$|<b>Organelles</b> of {{two kinds}} were studied: nemadesmata and {{transverse}} fibres, which are kinetosomal rootlets in oral parts of Dileptus. A diminution of microtubule number and length {{was found in}} <b>organelles</b> of size-reduced and regenerating cells, as compared to normal ones. It appeared, how-ever, that <b>organelles</b> reduced in size were always larger and longer than could be expected on a basis of perfectly proportional regulation. The results give {{some insight into the}} modes of formation and regulation of the size of these <b>organelles...</b>|$|R
5|$|This {{theory was}} {{confirmed}} {{through the use}} of electron microscopy in the late 1950s. Although he did not publish the first electron microscopy study of lipid bilayers J. David Robertson was the first to assert that the two dark electron-dense bands were the headgroups and associated proteins of two apposed lipid monolayers. In this body of work, Robertson put forward the concept of the “unit membrane.” This {{was the first time the}} bilayer structure had been universally assigned to all cell membranes as well as <b>organelle</b> membranes.|$|E
5|$|Lysosomes are organelles {{that contain}} hydrolytic enzymes {{that are used}} for {{intracellular}} digestion. The main functions of a lysosome are to process molecules taken in by the cell and to recycle worn out cell parts. The enzymes inside of lysosomes are acid hydrolases which require an acidic environment for optimal performance. Lysosomes provide such an environment by maintaining a pH of 5.0 inside of the <b>organelle.</b> If a lysosome were to rupture, the enzymes released would not be very active because of the cytosol's neutral pH. However, if numerous lysosomes leaked the cell could be destroyed from autodigestion.|$|E
5|$|Lysosomes {{carry out}} {{intracellular}} digestion, {{in a process}} called phagocytosis (from the Greek phagein, to eat and kytos, vessel, referring here to the cell), by fusing with a vacuole and releasing their enzymes into the vacuole. Through this process, sugars, amino acids, and other monomers pass into the cytosol and become nutrients for the cell. Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to recycle the cell's obsolete organelles in a process called autophagy. The lysosome engulfs another <b>organelle</b> and uses its enzymes to take apart the ingested material. The resulting organic monomers are {{then returned to the}} cytosol for reuse. The last function of a lysosome is to digest the cell itself through autolysis.|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of peroxisomal membrane ghosts was examined in liver biopsies from eleven patients presenting the clinical and biochemical {{picture of a}} generalized peroxisomal disorder (Zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile Refsum disease and variants of these syndromes). A polyclonal antibody raised against the membrane of human liver peroxisomes and recognizing a 43 kDa peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP) was used. In human control liver the antibodies react in a distinct and specific way with the peroxisomal membrane. Two types of <b>organelles</b> with an immunoreactive membrane were identified in the liver parenchymal cells of the patients: <b>organelles</b> containing an electron-dense core and <b>organelles</b> with electron transparent contents. Both types may co-occur in the same patient; in two patients they {{were found in the}} same cell. The <b>organelles</b> are rare, and their number varies between patients. The first type possibly corresponds to the previous morphological description of aberrant peroxisomes in the liver of patients with Zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy and infantile Refsum disease. The empty looking <b>organelles</b> have not been reported previously in the liver, some of the "empty" <b>organelles</b> seem to be enclosed by a double membrane. Morphometrical analysis in three patients indicated that both types of <b>organelles</b> (corrected mean d-circle 0. 271 - 0. 306 micron for the "empty" and the dense core <b>organelles,</b> respectively) are smaller than the peroxisomes in postnatal control liver and in fetal liver. In one patient (infantile Refsum disease) immunoreactive <b>organelles</b> were not detected. The <b>organelles</b> with the electron-dense core were not found in two patients.

40|$|Microtubules {{are thought}} to play {{important}} roles in various cellular activities, including mitosis, determination of cellular shape, and the transport, organization, and distribution of <b>organelles</b> in higher eukaryotic cells. The involvement of microtubules in the transport, organization, and distribution of <b>organelles</b> requires the activity of motor proteins that interact with both microtubules and <b>organelles</b> (Hirokawa 1993, 1998; Holzbaur and Vallee, 1994; Schroer, 1994).

5|$|Most lipids are {{synthesized}} in yeast {{either in}} the endoplasmic reticulum, lipid particles, or the mitochondrion, {{with little or no}} lipid synthesis occurring in the plasma membrane or nuclear membrane. Sphingolipid biosynthesis begins in the endoplasmic reticulum, but is completed in the Golgi apparatus. The situation is similar in mammals, {{with the exception of the}} first few steps in ether lipid biosynthesis, which occur in peroxisomes. The various membranes that enclose the other subcellular organelles must therefore be constructed by transfer of lipids from these sites of synthesis. However, although it is clear that lipid transport is a central process in <b>organelle</b> biogenesis, the mechanisms by which lipids are transported through cells remain poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|The MAM is a {{critical}} signaling, metabolic, and trafficking hub in the cell that allows for the integration of ER and mitochondrial physiology. Coupling between these organelles is not simply structural but functional as well and critical for overall cellular physiology and homeostasis. The MAM thus offers a perspective on mitochondria that diverges from the traditional view of this <b>organelle</b> as a static, isolated unit appropriated for its metabolic capacity by the cell. Instead, this mitochondrial-ER interface emphasizes {{the integration of the}} mitochondria, the product of an endosymbiotic event, into diverse cellular processes.|$|E
5|$|The MAM is {{enriched in}} enzymes {{involved}} in lipid biosynthesis, such as phosphatidylserine synthase on the ER face and phosphatidylserine decarboxylase on the mitochondrial face. Because mitochondria are dynamic organelles constantly undergoing fission and fusion events, they require a constant and well-regulated supply of phospholipids for membrane integrity. But mitochondria {{are not only}} a destination for the phospholipids they finish synthesis of; rather, this <b>organelle</b> also {{plays a role in}} inter-organelle trafficking of the intermediates and products of phospholipid biosynthetic pathways, ceramide and cholesterol metabolism, and glycosphingolipid anabolism.|$|E

40|$|Blastocystis is a {{unicellular}} stramenopile {{of controversial}} pathogenicity in humans [1, 2]. Although it is a strict anaerobe, Blastocystis has mitochondrion-like <b>organelles</b> with cristae, a transmembrane potential and DNA [2 – 4]. An {{apparent lack of}} several typical mitochondrial pathways has led some to suggest that these <b>organelles</b> might be hydrogenosomes, anaerobic <b>organelles</b> related to mitochondria [5, 6]. We generated 12, 767 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from Blastocystis and identified 115 clusters that encode putative mitochondrial and hydrogenosomal proteins. Among these is the canonical hydrogenosomal protein iron-only [FeFe] hydrogenase that we show localizes to the <b>organelles.</b> The <b>organelles</b> also have mitochondrial characteristics, including pathways for amino acid metabolism, iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis, and an incomplete tricarboxylic acid cycle {{as well as a}} mitochondrial genome. Although complexes I and II of the electron transport chain (ETC) are present, we found no evidence for complexes III and IV or F 1 Fo ATPases. The Blastocystis <b>organelles</b> have metabolic properties of aerobic and anaerobic mitochondria and of hydrogenosomes [7, 8]. They are convergently similar to <b>organelles</b> recently described in the unrelated ciliate Nyctotherus ovalis[9].

5|$|Cell nuclei contain {{most of the}} cell's genetic material, {{organized}} as multiple long linear DNA molecules in complex with a large variety of proteins, such as histones, to form chromosomes. The genes within these chromosomes are the cell's nuclear genome and are structured {{in such a way}} to promote cell function. The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression—the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell. The main structures making up the nucleus are the nuclear envelope, a double membrane that encloses the entire <b>organelle</b> and isolates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm, and the nuclear matrix (which includes the nuclear lamina), a network within the nucleus that adds mechanical support, much like the cytoskeleton, which supports the cell as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{enters the}} body through the {{digestive}} tract. A transporter protein on {{the cells of}} the small bowel, copper membrane transporter 1 (Ctr1; SLC31A1), carries copper inside the cells, where some is bound to metallothionein and part is carried by ATOX1 to an <b>organelle</b> known as the trans-Golgi network. Here, in response to rising concentrations of copper, an enzyme called ATP7A releases copper into the portal vein to the liver. Liver cells also carry the CMT1 protein, and metallothionein and ATOX1 bind it inside the cell, but here it is ATP7B that links copper to ceruloplasmin and releases it into the bloodstream, as well as removing excess copper by secreting it into bile. Both functions of ATP7B are impaired in Wilson's disease. Copper accumulates in the liver tissue; ceruloplasmin is still secreted, but in a form that lacks copper (termed apoceruloplasmin) and is rapidly degraded in the bloodstream.|$|E

However, due to {{the large number of}} different regulated secretory <b>organelles,</b> only a few of them have been specifically characterized. New insights into regulated secretory <b>organelles</b> open crucial perspectives for a better comprehension of the mechanisms that govern cell secretion.

5000|$|The {{primary use}} of FLIP is to {{determine}} the continuity of membranous <b>organelles.</b> This continuity or lack thereof is determined by observing the amount of fluorescence in the region of interest. If there is a complete loss of fluorescence, this indicates that the <b>organelles</b> are continuous. However, if there is incomplete loss of fluorescence, then there is not continuity between the <b>organelles.</b> Instead, these <b>organelles</b> are compartmentalized and therefore closed off to the transfer of any photobleached fluorophores. [...] Continuity of the Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, and nucleus have been verified using FLIP.|$|R
5|$|The ER has {{a central}} role in producing, processing, and {{transporting}} biochemical compounds for use inside and outside of the cell. Its membrane is the site of production of all the transmembrane proteins and lipids for most of the cell's organelles, including the ER itself, the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, endosomes, mitochondria, peroxisomes, secretory vesicles, and the plasma membrane. Furthermore, almost all of the proteins that will exit the cell, plus those destined for the lumen of the ER, Golgi apparatus, or lysosomes, are originally delivered to the ER lumen. Consequently, many of the proteins found in the cisternal space of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen are there only temporarily as they pass on their way to other locations. Other proteins, however, constantly remain in the lumen and are known as endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins. These special proteins contain a specialized retention signal made up of a specific sequence of amino acids that enables them to be retained by the <b>organelle.</b> An example of an important endoplasmic reticulum resident protein is the chaperon protein known as BiP which identifies other proteins that have been improperly built or processed and keeps them from being sent to their final destinations.|$|E
5|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) is a membranous synthesis and transport <b>organelle</b> {{that is an}} extension of the nuclear envelope. More than half the total membrane in eukaryotic cells is accounted for by the ER. The ER is made up of flattened sacs and branching tubules that are thought to interconnect, so that the ER membrane forms a continuous sheet enclosing a single internal space. This highly convoluted space is called the ER lumen and is also referred to as the ER cisternal space. The lumen takes up about ten percent of the entire cell volume. The {{endoplasmic reticulum}} membrane allows molecules to be selectively transferred between the lumen and the cytoplasm, and since it is connected to the nuclear envelope, it provides a channel between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of the lipid bilayer in biology is to {{separate}} aqueous compartments from their surroundings. Without some form of barrier delineating “self” from “non-self,” {{it is difficult to}} even define the concept of an organism or of life. This barrier {{takes the form of a}} lipid bilayer in all known life forms except for a few species of archaea that utilize a specially adapted lipid monolayer. It has even been proposed that the very first form of life may have been a simple lipid vesicle with virtually its sole biosynthetic capability being the production of more phospholipids. The partitioning ability of the lipid bilayer is based on the fact that hydrophilic molecules cannot easily cross the hydrophobic bilayer core, as discussed in Transport across the bilayer below. The nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts have two lipid bilayers, while other sub-cellular structures are surrounded by a single lipid bilayer (such as the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticula, Golgi apparatus and lysosomes). See <b>Organelle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mitochondria are <b>organelles</b> {{vital in}} {{metabolism}} {{as they are}} {{the site of the}} citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.

Together with the simultaneous presence of negative <b>organelles,</b> this might reflect the onset of catalase import into the peroxisomes during this period. Catalase heterogeneity excludes a continuous exchange of matrix contents; moreover, interconnections between peroxisomes have not been observed, and no cluster formation occurs. The data therefore also suggest that catalase is imported into individual, preexisting <b>organelles</b> in embryonic liver. The three peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzymes become detectable by immunocytochemistry only later during development.
