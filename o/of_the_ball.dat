5|$|During gameplay, players {{attempt to}} create goal-scoring {{opportunities}} through individual control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.|$|E

5|$|Nebraska's kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 19-yard line, and Oxendine ran one yard on the last play of the third quarter. With one quarter remaining in the game, Virginia Tech was in possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> but trailed, 3121.|$|E
5|$|Nevada {{recorded}} better statistics than Maryland {{in several}} areas despite ultimately losing the game. The Wolf Pack compiled seven more first downs, 172more passing yards, 28more total offensive yards, 15fewer penalty yards, 15.8%more third down conversions, and 2:26more time in possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|E
5|$|On the {{opposite}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> Texas' receiving corps was led by Mike Adams, who had six grabs for 92 yards. Tight end Pat Fitzgerald had the Longhorns' only receiving touchdown, and he finished the game with three catches for 21 yards. Three other players had two or fewer receptions.|$|E

5|$|The {{primary role}} of the goalkeeper is to block shots at the goal. After saving the ball, the goalkeeper has the {{responsibility}} to keep possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{in order to stop}} opposing players regaining possession. They must make sure that whenever the opposition appears to be ready to make a shot on goal, their hands are near or above the surface of the water. They also possess the job to pass down the pool accurately in order to retain possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> often starting the team's counterattack.|$|E
5|$|The {{special teams}} unit is {{responsible}} for all kicking plays. The special teams unit of the team in control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> will try and execute field goal (FG) attempts, punts and kickoffs, while the opposing team's unit will aim to block or return them.|$|E
5|$|The {{two teams}} traded {{possessions}} once more, {{and as the}} first quarter came to an end, Georgia Tech was in possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> but was preparing to punt it away after yet another failure {{to pick up a}} first down.|$|E

5|$|After Tech's kickoff, Air Force went {{three and}} out {{and was forced to}} punt. The Hokies took over at their 34-yard line after the kick. Bryan Randall {{completed}} two quick passes to wide receiver Shawn Witten for a total of 26yards before time in the quarter ran out. At {{the end of the first}} quarter, Air Force had a 10–7 lead, but Virginia Tech was in possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> and driving deeper into Air Force territory.|$|E
5|$|Another feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is its rubber layer; it was {{designed}} to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup. Its support material of cross-linked nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability. The asymmetrical high-contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal, allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball.|$|E
5|$|Appalachian State {{continued}} their drive but {{were forced to}} punt after being stopped on 3rd down. Michigan began their drive at the Appalachian State 34-yard line, but a Henne pass was intercepted by Mountaineer defender Leonard Love on the fourth play of the drive. Love returned the ball 26-yards, and Appalachian State began the drive at their own 41-yard line, but were forced to punt after going three-and-out. Michigan got the ball at their own 24-yard line and mounted a nine-play, 43-yard drive to the Appalachian State 33-yard line. On the final play, a fourth and five, Henne's pass fell incomplete, turning the ball over to Appalachian State, who were again quickly forced to punt. After returning the punt to their own 46-yard line, Hart ran the ball 54yards for a touchdown, giving Michigan the lead 32–31 with 4:36 left. Michigan chose to go for two, but the conversion attempt failed. Edwards was picked off on the first play of the ensuing drive, giving Michigan control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> at the Appalachian State 43-yard line. Michigan ran five plays before attempting a 43-yard field goal. The attempt was blocked, however, giving Appalachian State control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> with 1:37 left. With no timeouts left, the Mountaineers drove 69yards down the field in just over a minute in game time, setting up a Rauch field goal from 24yards out with 26seconds left. The attempt was good, giving Appalachian State a 34–32 lead. Michigan regained control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> on the ensuing kickoff, and a 46-yard pass from Henne to Mario Manningham gave the Wolverines a 37-yard field goal attempt with six seconds left on the clock. The attempt was blocked by Corey Lynch, securing a 34–32 win by the Mountaineers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} an estimation problem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball’s</b> state <b>of</b> spin in RoboCup Small Size League (SSL).

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the fourth quarter, Georgia Tech was in possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> deep inside Wake Forest territory. Shortly after the quarter began, Tech failed to gain a needed first down in order to continue its drive. Instead of attempting to convert the fourth down—Tech had attempted and failed on two fourth-down conversions in the third quarter—Tech instead sent in kicker Travis Bell. Bell's 34-yard attempt sailed through the goalposts, and with 12:53 remaining in the game, Georgia Tech took a 63 lead.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian striker Fred, who was {{replaced}} by Willian in the 70th minute, received a particularly hostile reaction from the home fans. According to Opta Sports, Fred failed to make a single tackle, cross, run or interception during the match, and actually spent {{the majority of his}} time in possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> on the centre spot due to six restarts.|$|E
5|$|Brugge {{started the}} match {{the better of}} the two sides and {{took the lead in}} the 5th minute. A headed back-pass by Phil Neal fell short of Liverpool goalkeeper Ray Clemence {{allowing}} Brugge midfielder Raoul Lambert to take control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> and lob it over Clemence and into the Liverpool goal. Seven minutes later Brugge extended their lead when Julien Cools scored. The Belgians kept attacking, but the Liverpool defence of Emlyn Hughes and Tommy Smith were able to repel the Belgians until half-time.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{playing as}} a {{deep-lying}} midfielder, Carrick does {{not rely on}} pace, physical attributes and tackling like a typical ball-winning midfielder. Instead, his reading of the game helps him anticipate any attacking threats from the opposition team, {{most of the time}} by covering space and making interceptions. His distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> creativity, and range of passing, which are among the best in comparison to other midfielders in Europe, add to his importance in dictating the tempo of the game, as well as initiating team attacks.|$|E
5|$|Each {{team had}} two players pass the ball. Tech's Tommy Stafford {{finished}} the game having completed four 13 passes for 59yards and one interception. Several {{times during the}} game, the Hokies had also played with Barker passing the ball. He finished having completed two of his three passes for 13yards. On the Miami side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> Miller completed nine of 26 passes for 99yards and Olivo completed one pass for nine yards.|$|E
5|$|Festivities {{formally}} {{begin in}} the early evening with the raising <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> at around 6:00p.m. ET. Party favors are distributed to attendees, which have historically included large balloons, hats, and other items branded with the event's corporate sponsors. The hours before the drop are preceded by hourly countdowns for the arrival of the new year in other countries, along with live music performances by popular musicians. Some of these performances are organized by, and aired on New Year's Eve television specials which are broadcast from Times Square.|$|E
