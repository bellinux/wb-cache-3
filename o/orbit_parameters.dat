5|$|STS-125 was {{the only}} planned shuttle mission after the Columbia {{accident}} to be launched into a low-inclination orbit that did not allow rendezvous with the International Space Station. Due to the inclination and other <b>orbit</b> <b>parameters</b> of Hubble, Atlantis would {{have been unable to}} use the International Space Station as a safe haven in the event of structural or mechanical failure. To preserve NASA's post-Columbia requirement of having shuttle Launch On Need (LON) rescue capability, STS-400 was the flight designation given to the Contingency Shuttle Crew Support (CSCS) mission which would have been flown by Endeavour in the event Atlantis became disabled during STS-125. After Atlantis performed the late inspection and was cleared for re-entry, Endeavour was officially released from stand-by status on Thursday, 21 May.|$|E
25|$|The navigational {{message of}} CDMA signals is {{transmitted}} as {{a sequence of}} text strings. The message has variable size - each pseudo-frame usually includes six strings and contains ephemerides for the current satellite (string types 10, 11, and 12 in a sequence) {{and part of the}} almanac for three satellites (three strings of type 20). To transmit the full almanac for all current 24 satellites, a superframe of 8 pseudo-frames is required. In the future, the superframe will be expanded to 10 pseudo-frames of data to cover full 30 satellites. The message can also contain Earth rotation parameters, ionosphere models, long-term <b>orbit</b> <b>parameters</b> for GLONASS satellites, and COSPAS-SARSAT messages. The system time marker is transmitted with each string; UTC leap second correction is achieved by shortening or lengthening (zero-padding) the final string of the day by one second, with abnormal strings being discarded by the receiver. The strings have a version tag to facilitate forward compatibility: future upgrades to the message format will not break older equipment, which will continue to work by ignoring new data (as long as the constellation still transmits old string types), but up-to-date equipment {{will be able to use}} additional information from newer satellites.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to develop a}} Full-Sky Sensor (FSS) to detect the Earth, Sun and Moon from a spinning spacecraft. The concept adopted has infinitely variable resolution. A high-speed search mode is implemented on the spacecraft. The advantages are: (1) a single sensor determines attitude parameters from Earth, Sun and Moon, thus eliminating instrument mounting errors; (2) the bias between the actual spacecraft spin axis and the intended spin axis can be determined; (3) cost is minimized; and (4) ground processing is straightforward. The FSS is a modification of an existing flight-proven sensor. Modifications to the electronics are necessary to accommodate the amplitude range and signal width range of the celestial bodies to be detected.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we study}} a two-parameter family {ϕµ,ν} of twodimensional diffeomorphisms such that ϕ 0, 0 = ϕ has a cubic homoclinic {{tangency}} unfolding generically which {{is associated with}} a dissipative saddle point. Our first theorem presents an open set O in the µν-plane with Cl(O) ∋ (0, 0) such that, for any (µ 0, ν 0) ∈ O, there exists a one-parameter subfamily of {ϕµ,ν} passing through ϕµ 0,ν 0 and exhibiting cubically related persistent contact-making and contact-breaking quadratic tangencies. Moreover, the second theorem shows that any such two-parameter family satisfies Wang-Young’s conditions which guarantee that some ϕµ,ν arbitrarily near ϕ exhibits a cubic polynomial-like strange attractor with an SRB measure. One of main motivations behind studies in monotonic or nonmonotonic bifurcation phenomena is attributed to results given in Milnor-Thurston [23] for the logistic family, where there are only <b>orbit</b> creation <b>parameters</b> but no <b>orbit</b> annihilation <b>parameters.</b> In contrast with the logistic family, some family of one-dimensional cubi...|$|R
