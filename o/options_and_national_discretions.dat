However, a close examination {{of the development of}} substantive EC regulation in telecommunications shows that the Commission <b>and</b> <b>national</b> governments acted in partnership. Major conflicts concerned constitutional issues rather than substantive ones. How and why the partnership came to exist is analyzed using a principalagent framework. The paper argues that formal and informal institutional controls made the Commission very sensitive to the preferences of national governments in substantive EC telecommunications regulation. Four processes of decision making whereby both formal controls and less formal institutions (norms) operated to prevent agency losses for governments are found: the participation of national governments at all stages of decision making; incrementalism; compromises <b>and</b> linkages; <b>national</b> <b>discretion</b> in implementation.

This paper {{is a critical}} synthesis of the policy response to the severe haze episodes of 1997 / 1998. It {{is based on a}} series of science-policy activities co-ordinated by the Global Change Impacts Centre for Southeast Asia aimed at exploring land-use planning <b>and</b> management <b>options</b> to reduce the impacts of transboundary {{pollution from}} vegetation fires. We begin with a brief summary of what is known about the causes of the fires and haze, the composition and distribution of haze, and the main impacts. Policy <b>options</b> <b>and</b> instruments are considered at a range of levels, from local waste-wood management <b>options</b> <b>and</b> <b>national</b> land development strategies, through to regional and international institutions. In these analyses, we seek to understand the interaction of different interest groups and identify potentially complementary policies as well as likely tradeoffs. Ultimately, the aims of these activities are improvement of the public policy process and greater relevance of research activities and research-based knowledge. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) aims {{to achieve}} Good Environmental Status (GES) in Europe's Seas. The {{requirement}} for regional sea authorities {{to identify and}} prioritise issues for management has meant that standardized methods to assess {{the current level of}} departure from GES are needed. The methodology presented here provides a means by which existing information describing the status of ecosystem components of a regional sea can be used to determine the effort required to achieve GES. A risk assessment framework was developed to score departure from GES for 10 out of the 11 GES descriptors, based on proposed definitions of ‘good’ status, and current knowledge of environmental status {{in each of the four}} regional seas (North-East Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea, Baltic Sea and Black Sea). This provides an approach for regional evaluation of environmental issues <b>and</b> <b>national</b> prioritisation of conservation objectives.

Although the Directive establishes, in general, uniform rules to set capital requirements across European countries, there are some areas where the Directive allows some heterogeneity. In particular, countries are asked to choose among different possibilities when transposing the Directive, which are called <b>national</b> <b>discretions</b> (ND). The main objective of our research is to use such observed heterogeneity to gather empirical evidence on the effects on European banks of more or less stringency and more or less risk sensitivity in capital requirements.

This paper details four phases of PV programme planning: the preparation of PV programme, programme design, implementation and monitoring / evaluation. This should also be used once the programme developer has a clear concept for a feasible plans and should be useful to all the decision-makers in the process of developing programme, may be they are host governments in developing countries, PV programme developers and sponsors, PV producers and suppliers, entrepreneurs, or NGOs. This Paper is deals with preparation for PV programmes, including needs assessment, stakeholder consultation, social context analysis, supply <b>options</b> <b>and</b> <b>national</b> policy considerations <b>and</b> Design of PV programmes, including establishment of goals, delivery modes, timelines, and logistics and quality assurance. A number of methodologies have been developed over the years with the aim of improving programme design and implementation. This paper is intended to highlight the issues related to a rural energy programmes in developing countries rather than providing an in-depth step by step methodology to standard programmed design, planning and implementation. Though the focus of this paper is on PV technologies, much of the discussion will apply to other rural decentralized energy systems. Solar-based electricity for our houses is essential nowadays as the monthly power bills are escalating regularly. Also, the whole world is now facing the challenge ‘global warming’. By using eco friendly and green technologies, we would help reduce global warming and help climate change mitigation.

40|$|Energy is an {{essential}} ingredient of socio-economic development and economic growth. Renewable energy provides a variable <b>and</b> environmental friendly <b>option</b> <b>and</b> <b>national</b> energy security {{at a time when}} decreasing global reserves of fossil fuels threatens the long-term sustainability of global economy. The integration of renewable resources in desalination and water purification is becoming increasingly attractive. This is justified by the fact that areas of fresh water shortages have plenty of solar energy and these technologies have low operating and maintenance costs. In this paper an attempt has been made to present a review, in brief, work of the highlights that have been achieved during the recent years worldwide and the state-of-the-art for most important efforts in the field of desalination by renewable energies, with emphasis on technologies and economics. The review also includes water sources, demand, availability of potable water and purification methods. The classification of distillation units has been done on the basis of literature survey till today. A comparative study between different renewable energy technologies powered desalination systems as well as economics have been done. The real problem in these technologies is the optimum economic design and evaluation of the combined plants in order to be economically viable for remote or arid regions. Wind energy technology is cheaper than the conventional ones, and used extensively around the world. The slow implementation of renewable energy projects especially in the developing countries are mostly due to the governments subsides of conventional fuels products and electricity. The economic analyses carried out so far {{have not been able to}} provide a strong basis for comparing economic viability of each desalination technology. The economic performances expressed in terms of cost of water production have been based on different system capacity, system energy source, system component, and water source. These differences make it difficult, if not impossible, to assess the economic performance of a particular technology and compare it with others. Reverse osmosis is becoming the technology of choice with continued advances being made to reduce the total energy consumption and lower the cost of water produced.

40|$|Introduction: Innovative {{biologic}} medicines {{have been}} linked to a skyrocketing cost which introduces high pressures on the already constrained national health budgets. The adoption of biosimilars (similar versions of an approved biologic reference product) allows to expand patients’ access to costly therapies, increasing the diversity of treatment <b>options</b> <b>and</b> attenuating <b>national</b> health budget pressures, releasing resources {{that can be used in}} other areas. Despite this advantage, biosimilars’ European market is not yet fully established and it is common to observe high variances in biosimilars’ adoption among European Union Member States due to unawareness of the dynamics that rule the market. Therefore, the present study aims to identify the most relevant dynamics of the EU biosimilars’ market and to access the influence of those in the market share obtained by these medicines in 10 years. Methods: In order to do so, it is performed a statistical study based on a 22 European Union countries’ sample for which are obtained a total of 11 market dynamics (independent variables) whose correlation with market share (dependent variable) is accessed through multiple linear regression using the statistical method ANOVA. Results: The results achieved comprise three mathematical models which confirm the influence of three market dynamics in a biosimilars’ market share.

Supplementing functional-political explanations, we propose an endogenous model of institutional change that incorporates the independent role transnational networks play in shaping their own institutionalisation, which may make this mode of governance more resilient and even self-reinforcing.
