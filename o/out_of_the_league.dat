5|$|However, {{before the}} start of the 1947–48 NBL season, Maurice White, the {{president}} of the American Gear Company and the owner of the American Gears NBL team, pulled the team <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>league.</b> White planned to create a 24-team league called the Professional Basketball League of America, in which he owned all the teams and arenas. However, the league folded after just a month, and the players of White's teams were equally distributed among the 11 remaining NBL franchises. As a consequence, every team had a 9.09% chance of landing Mikan, who ended up on the Minneapolis Lakers, playing for coach John Kundla.|$|E
5|$|In the cup competitions, Rovers were knocked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>League</b> Cup at {{the first}} round stage in a penalty shootout, having drawn 1–1 with Championship side Luton Town after extra time. They fared better in the FA Cup however, {{reaching}} the fourth round stage where they lost again to a Championship team; this time Derby County. The most successful cup competition for Rovers was the Football League Trophy, in which they reached the final {{for the first time}} since the 1989–90 competition.

After they ended Chelsea's unbeaten start to the season, Pardew left for Crystal Palace. On 26 January 2015, his assistant John Carver {{was put in charge}} {{for the remainder of the}} season but came close to relegation, staying up on the final day with a 2–0 home win against West Ham, with Jonás Gutiérrez, who beat testicular cancer earlier in the season, scoring the team's second goal.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} founded in 1893 and joined the Football League in 1920. They were voted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> in favour of Ipswich Town {{at the end of}} the 1937–38 season, but {{returned}} to it 12 years later after it was expanded from 88 to 92 clubs. Twice in the late 1980s they came close to winning promotion to the second tier of English football, but a decline then set in and in 1993 they narrowly avoided relegation to the Football Conference. Between 2000 and 2005, Gillingham were in the second tier of the English football league system for the only time in their history, achieving a club record highest league finish of eleventh place in 2002–03.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} February 1933, Hitler {{announced}} that rearmament must be undertaken, albeit clandestinely at first, as {{to do so}} was {{in violation of the}} Versailles Treaty. A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date for going to war in the east. He pulled Germany <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>League</b> of Nations in 1933, claiming its disarmament clauses were unfair as they applied only to Germany. The Saarland, which had been placed under League of Nations supervision for 15 years at the end of World War I, voted in January 1935 to become part of Germany. In March 1935, Hitler announced that the Reichswehr would be increased to 550,000 men and that he was creating an air force. Britain agreed that the Germans would be allowed to build a naval fleet with the signing of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement on 18 June 1935.|$|E

5|$|During the 1999 NBA draft, {{believing that}} the Raptors still lacked a strong frontcourt presence, Grunwald traded first-round draft pick Jonathan Bender for power forward Antonio Davis of the Indiana Pacers. Davis quickly entered the Raptors {{starting}} lineup and he would develop into an All-Star in the coming years. Conversely, Bender would only play nine seasons and would be <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> by age 29. In the backcourt, Carter, Christie and Dell Curry played at the shooting guard position and Alvin Williams and Muggsy Bogues at point guard. The rotation of Davis, Oakley and Willis in the frontcourt and Carter's and McGrady's improvement helped the team make its first ever playoff appearance, fulfilling a promise Carter had made to fans in the previous season. Lacking significant post-season experience, Toronto was defeated 3–0 by the New York Knicks in the first round. Nonetheless, team improvements {{and the rise of}} Carter—who emphatically won the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Contest—attracted many fans around Toronto, many of whom were previously not basketball fans. The season was also the first full year played at the Air Canada Centre, after having played four years at the cavernous SkyDome, which was better suited to baseball and Canadian football. Overall, the Raptors concluded the season with a 45–37 record.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{strengthen}} for 1996–97, Smith signed striker Nigel Jemson and spent £100,000 on Leyton Orient defender Darren Purse. In order to finance these deals he sold Chris Allen to Nottingham Forest for £450,000. Oxford knocked Premier League team Sheffield Wednesday <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>League</b> Cup {{en route to}} a fourth round exit. Oxford were fifth in the table in December 1996, but chairman Robin Herd resigned amidst financial problems at the club, and work on the new stadium came to a halt as the club debt reached £13million. Smith raised funds by selling Elliott to Leicester for £1.7million, and signed veteran defender Chris Whyte on a free transfer as a short-term replacement. Oxford finished the season in 17th place, but the club's financial situation became ever bleaker. Numerous players were sold, though Smith was allowed to spend £170,000 on defender Phil Whelan. Smith left the Manor Ground midway through 1997–98 with Oxford 16th in the league, and his assistant Crosby managed to maintain the club's mid-table position {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} league game of 2009–10 season, Fàbregas scored a brace and managed two assists in Arsenal's 6–1 away win against Everton. Arsenal {{went on to}} secure {{qualification}} for the 2009–10 Champions League campaign by beating Celtic over two legs, but their early momentum to the season was disrupted by consecutive league game losses to Manchester United and Manchester City. The team bounced back strongly after this setback, and with Fàbregas being prolific in scoring and setting up his teammates, it went unbeaten in the next 13 games. Despite suffering four league losses even before mid-season approached, Arsenal managed to lead the league standings after 22 games. On 31 March 2010, in the Champions League first leg of the quarter-final against Barcelona, Fàbregas suffered a leg fracture before scoring the equalising goal in the game which ended 2–2. Arsenal, who were four points behind league leaders Manchester United, were deprived of their captain for the remaining six league games of the season; they were subsequently eliminated by Barcelona in the Champions League, and fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> title race. Fàbregas was later named to the PFA Team of the Year.|$|E

5|$|On 12 August, Tranmere were knocked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>League</b> Cup after a home defeat to the Championship side Nottingham Forest {{through a}} single first half goal.

In the next two games Tranmere was defeated by Shrewsbury Town 1–2 after two late goals and earned their first win and clean sheet at Wycombe Wanderers by scoring a goal either side of half-time. On 18 August, Edwards added to the squad with the first loan signing of the season, bringing young Saint Lucian defender Janoi Donacien over from Aston Villa until January 2015. Tranmere were defeated at home by Cheltenham Town 2–3 despite leading 2–0 at half-time. The first month of the season was concluded with a victory against 10-man Morecambe. Both goals were scored by Cole Stockton who extended his contract with Tranmere earlier that week till the summer of 2017.|$|E
5|$|The 2012–13 {{season was}} {{undoubtedly}} a low ebb {{for the club}} under Jeffrey's reign. The Blues were off the pace {{for most of the}} league campaign – their season encapsulated in a 3–1 home defeat by newly promoted Ballinamallard United in October 2012. Cliftonville were the eventual champions, securing their fourth league title after defeating Linfield 3–2 at Solitude on 13 April 2013. Crusaders secured the runners-up place, leaving the Blues in third place – a distant 29 points behind the champions. The club went out of the 2013 Setanta Sports Cup after a heavy aggregate defeat in the quarter-finals, went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>League</b> Cup at the semi-final stage, and exited the Irish Cup in the fifth round after a replay. The club's first Irish Cup defeat in four years was also the first time in 16 years they had lost their opening tie of the competition.|$|E
5|$|Washington shared {{time at the}} Trail Blazers {{power forward}} spot with Maurice Lucas at first, but after Lucas' trade to the New Jersey Nets, he became the {{full-time}} starter. He played three seasons in Portland, during which he earned {{a spot in the}} 1980 NBA All-Star Game, after some of the top players sat out due to injury. During that All-Star weekend, which was held in Landover, Maryland, nearby American U. held a halftime ceremony in which they retired Washington's number. He was named a team captain for the following season. In his post-punch career, numerous players, coaches, and officials noted that he became less aggressive on the court out of fear of getting into another fight; something he never did. Washington started experiencing pain in his back and knees during the 1980–81 season. The pain became unbearable during the 1981–82 season, and he retired in January 1982 after missing all but 20 games. In 1987, after more than five years <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>league,</b> he tried to make a comeback with the Warriors, but lasted only eight games on the roster (playing in six of them) before being cut.|$|E

After four seasons in the Third Division, York were relegated in 1987–88, statistically the club's worst Football League season. They beat Crewe Alexandra on penalties at Wembley Stadium in the play-off final in 1992–93, winning promotion back to the third tier of English football, now renamed as the Second Division. The following season, York competed in the play-off semi-final, when they were beaten by Stockport County. Later in the 1990s, they knocked Premier League teams Manchester United and Everton <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>League</b> Cup in successive seasons. After six seasons, York were relegated to the Third Division in 1998–99.
