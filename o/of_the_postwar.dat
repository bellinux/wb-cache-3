5|$|Another legacy was the Arbeitsstab Wiederaufbau zerstörter Städte (Working {{group on}} Reconstruction of {{destroyed}} cities), authorized by Speer in 1943 to rebuild bombed German cities {{to make them}} more livable {{in the age of the}} automobile. Headed by Wolters, the working group took a possible military defeat into their calculations. The Arbeitsstabs recommendations served as the basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> redevelopment plans in many cities, and Arbeitsstab members became prominent in the rebuilding.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial Gift {{aircraft}} {{formed the}} basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> Canadian Air Force (CAF), later the Royal Canadian Air Force. In 1920, the Canadian Air Board sponsored a project to conduct the first Trans-Canada flight to determine the feasibility of such flights for air mail and passenger services. Rivière du Loup to Winnipeg was flown by Leckie and Major Basil Hobbs in a Felixstowe F.3 and {{the remainder of the}} relay was completed using several of the CAF's DH-9As. All aircraft were part of the Imperial Gift. Although not considered suitable for the harsh Canadian weather, the Imperial Gift aircraft soldiered on into the 1930s; the last aircraft in service, an Avro 504K, was retired in 1934.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of his first marriage, Waugh {{converted}} to Catholicism in 1930. His traditionalist stance led him to strongly oppose all attempts to reform the Church, and the changes by the Second Vatican Council (1962–65) greatly disturbed his sensibilities, especially {{the introduction of the}} vernacular Mass. That blow to his religious traditionalism, his dislike for the welfare state culture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> world and the decline of his health, darkened his final years, but he continued to write. To the public, Waugh displayed a mask of indifference, but he was capable of great kindness to those whom he considered to be his friends. After his death in 1966, he acquired a following of new readers through the film and television versions of his works, such as the television serial Brideshead Revisited (1981).|$|E

5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar's</b> presidents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fifth Republic {{wanted to}} leave their own monuments in Paris; President Georges Pompidou started the Centre Georges Pompidou (1977), Valéry Giscard d'Estaing began the Musée d'Orsay (1986); President François Mitterrand, in power for 14 years, built the Opéra Bastille (1985–1989), the Bibliothèque {{nationale}} de France (1996), the Arche de la Défense (1985–1989), and the Louvre Pyramid with its underground courtyard (1983–1989); Jacques Chirac (2006), the Musée du quai Branly.|$|R
5|$|During the {{subsequent}} Potsdam Conference in July–August 1945, {{the three major}} allied powers ratified the colossal westerly shift of Polish borders and approved its new territory between the Oder–Neisse line and Curzon Line. Following {{the destruction of the}} Polish-Jewish population in the Holocaust, the flight and expulsion of Germans in the west, resettlement of Ukrainians in the east, and the repatriation of Poles from Kresy, Poland became {{for the first time in}} its history an ethnically homogeneous nation-state without prominent minorities. The new government solidified its political power over the next two years, while the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) under Bolesław Bierut gained firm control over the country, which would become part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> Soviet sphere of influence in Central and Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|With city jobs {{moved to}} the towns and villages around Utica during the {{suburbanization}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> period. This led {{to the expansion of}} the nearby Town of New Hartford and the village of Whitesboro. Utica's lack of quality academic and educational choices, when compared to Syracuse under an hour away, contributed to its decline in local businesses and jobs as some economic activity moved to Syracuse during the 1990s. Utica's population fell while population in the county increased, reflecting a statewide trend of decreasing urban populations outside New York City. Residents who remain in the city struggle to handle poverty issues stemming from social and economic conditions caused partially by a smaller tax base; this adversely affects schools and public services.|$|E

25|$|Not all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> media {{featuring}} Italian soldiers use negative stereotypes, however; {{there are}} instances of the Italian Army and its soldiers being treated objectively within postwar Anglo-American media, {{for example in}} Von Ryan's Express or The Fallen.|$|E
25|$|Coombs deplored the {{breakdown}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> Keynesian economic consensus represented by Thatcherism, {{and in his}} 1990 book The Return of Scarcity he proposed a Common Wealth Estate to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth.

50|$|Beyond Sleep is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{canonical}} novels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dutch <b>postwar</b> period, and a {{prime example}} of what is perhaps the most distinctive characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> author's work, the intense cohesion between theme and narrative strategy.|$|R
25|$|Beginning {{during the}} {{revolution}} {{and in the first}} two decades <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> era, every state in the North abolished slavery, ending with New Jersey in 1804, although in some cases existing slaves were not liberated immediately. These were the first abolitionist laws in the Atlantic World.|$|E

25|$|In September 1922, West Haven was repossessed by the USSB {{after the}} Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Steamship Corporation went bankrupt. No further {{records of the}} ship's {{movements}} appear until 1929, indicating that the USSB may have laid the vessel up through the 1920s because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> oversupply of shipping.|$|E

50|$|Although Mounier was {{critical}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moscow Trials <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1930s, {{he has been}} taken to task by the historian Tony Judt, among others, for his failure to respond critically to <b>the</b> excesses <b>of</b> Stalinism in <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> period.|$|R
50|$|Hans Hopf (August 2, 1916, Nuremberg - June 25, 1993, Munich) was a German operatic tenor, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leading heldentenors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{immediate}} <b>postwar</b> period.

25|$|After World War II, the Ministry of Education {{decided to}} {{minimize}} the number of kanji by choosing {{the most commonly used}} kanji, along with simplified kanji (see Shinjitai) commonly appearing in contemporary literature, to form the tōyō kanji.

25|$|Geisel's early artwork often {{employed}} the shaded texture of pencil drawings or watercolors, {{but in his}} children's books <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> period, he generally made use of a starker medium—pen and ink—normally using just black, white, {{and one or two}} colors. His later books, such as The Lorax, used more colors.|$|E

25|$|The 1868 {{legislature}} banned former Confederates {{and passed}} a more wide-ranging law detailing funding and administrative issues and allowing Black children to attend school. In furtherance <b>of</b> this, <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> 1868 state constitution {{was the first}} to permit a personal-property tax to fund the lands and buildings for public schools. With the 1868 elections, the first county school commissioners took office.|$|R
50|$|After wartime {{restrictions}} on automotive production were ended, DeSoto returned to civilian car production when it reissued its 1942 models as 1946 models, {{but without the}} hidden-headlight feature, and with fender lines extending into the doors, like other Chrysler products <b>of</b> <b>the</b> immediate <b>postwar</b> period.|$|R
25|$|The {{appearance}} of the Soviet Tupolev Tu-4 'Bull' copy of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress in 1947 posed a new threat to postwar USAAF planners, and {{largely as a result}} of its appearance and the beginnings of the Cold War in 1948, led to the establishment of Air Defense Command (ADC) as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> United States Air Force.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} large-volume capital {{investments}} were {{undertaken by the}} Soviet central power to exploit resources on Estonian territory of Oil shale, lumber and, later, uranium ore, as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> reconstruction program.

500|$|Gorizia {{continued}} in service, seeing further {{action at the}} [...] First and Second Battles of Sirte. She was seriously damaged by American heavy bombers in April 1943 and towed to La Spezia, where she was still under repair when Italy surrendered in September. Germany seized the ship when they occupied the port, and Italian commandos unsuccessfully attempted to sink her in June 1944. In poor condition by <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> Italian Navy decided to sell the ship for scrap in 1947.|$|R
