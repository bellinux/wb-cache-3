5|$|According to Swedish legend, Charles XI {{travelled}} {{around the}} country dressed as a farmer <b>or</b> <b>simple</b> traveller. In the legend he {{is referred to as}} the Greycoat (Swedish: Gråkappan). This was done to discover and identify corruption and oppression against the populace. There are many stories about him arriving in villages looking for corrupt church officials and sending them to the gallows. However, Charles XI never travelled alone. He was always followed by a military cortège but he was one of the kings in Sweden during this era that travelled the most throughout the country. The stories of the Greycoat were published in a book by Arvid August Afzelius in the middle of the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Many insects possess very {{sensitive}} and, or specialized organs of perception. Some insects such as bees can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths, or detect polarized light, while the antennae of male moths can detect the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers. The yellow paper wasp (Polistes versicolor) {{is known for}} its wagging movements as a form of communication within the colony; it can waggle with a frequency of 10.6±2.1Hz (n=190). These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions. There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced <b>or</b> <b>simple</b> antennae, and vice versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound; while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying hearing, though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2kHz, and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50kHz. Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts, respectively. For instance, some nocturnal moths can perceive the ultrasonic emissions of bats, which helps them avoid predation. Insects that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts.|$|E
5|$|Rome's forces used typical Roman {{equipment}} including pila (heavy javelins) and hastae (thrusting spears) {{as weapons}} {{as well as}} traditional helmets, shields and body armor. On the other hand, the Carthaginian army {{used a variety of}} equipment. The Iberians fought with swords suited for cutting and thrusting, as well as javelins and various types of spears. For defense, Iberian warriors carried large oval shields and the falcata. The Gauls were likely wearing no armor, and the typical Gallic weapon was usually a long, slashing sword. The heavy Carthaginian cavalry carried two javelins and a curved slashing sword, with a heavy shield for protection. The Numidian cavalry were very lightly equipped, lacking saddles and bridles for their horses, and used no armor but carried small shields, javelins and possibly a knife or longer blade. Skirmishers acting as light infantry carried either slings or spears. The Balearic slingers, who were famous for their accuracy, carried short, medium and long slings used to cast stones or bullets. They may have carried a small shield <b>or</b> <b>simple</b> leather pelt on their arms, but this is uncertain. Hannibal himself was wearing musculata armor and carried a falcata as well.|$|E
