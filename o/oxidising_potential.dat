The model represents the plume by several circular or cylindrical layers in order to give a more detailed description of the chemical evolution in the plume. Model simulations of plumes from two B 747 aircraft monitored during the POLINAT measurement campaigns in winter 1994 and summer 1995 were performed. The NOx emission indices were 12. 5 and 26. 1 g kg~ 1, respectively. The chemical evolution was followed during the phase dominated by the aircraft-induced dispersion (vortex regime), and in the atmospheric-induced dispersion regime up to 15 h. The results were compared to observations of NO, HNO 3, HNO 2 and CO 2 taken within the trailing vortices. The modelled values were in broad agreement with the observations. With a NOx emission index of 26. 1 g kg~ 1, 60 % remained as NOx after 15 h at 503 N under summer conditions for emissions at 07 UT.

40|$|Redox potential, {{a measure}} of how {{oxidising}} or reducing an environment is, is tightly regulated by cells to minimise detrimental chemical oxidation and reduction reactions. In proteins, it is the sulfur containing cysteine residues that can be post-translationally modified through specific redox reactions, for example, the formation of disulfide bonds between cysteine residues can be crucial to protein structure. It has recently been hypothesised that signalling pathways utilising redox regulated proteins may be arranged into electrochemical series. The characterisation of the redox properties of specific cysteine residues in proteins has proven difficult using traditional redox characterisation methods such as cyclic voltammetry. A number of biochemical methods have been developed for studying the effect of the redox environment on proteins, many making use of mass spectrometry and allowing for localisation of the site of the modification to specific cysteine residues. However, fewer methods have been reported that facilitate accurate quantification for the determination of the mid-point potential of these redox regulated cysteine residues. Here, a differential labelling protocol using high resolution mass spectrometry techniques for the study of redox chemistry of cysteine residues in proteins will be reported. The protocol exploits the novel chemistry of thiol groups for specific alkylation and allows for both qualitative and quantitative experiments. Thioredoxin- 1 from E. coli and human systems was used as a model protein and a novel disulfide bond was characterised. The reducing potential of the active site cysteine residues of human thioredoxin were found to be very {{similar to those of the}} E. coli proteoform, - 276 ± 1 and - 281. 4 ± 0. 3 mV respectively. The remaining three cysteine residues of human thioredoxin were found to be regulated at more <b>oxidising</b> <b>potentials.</b> The protocol developed was applied to a protein from the cell death pathway of apoptosis; human caspase- 3 is an executioner protease from the caspase cascade. Caspase- 3 was found to contain three redox sensitive cysteine residues. The catalytically active cysteine residue was redox regulated via two mechanisms, glutathionylation and disulfide bond formation. One of these mechanisms gives the active site cysteine residue a calculated reducing potential of - 165 ± 6 mV supporting the correlation between caspase- 3 activity and its observed role in the apoptotic pathway but not in necrotic cell death...|$|R

However, unlike many other PPy films a calixarene-doped system is more complicated as calixarenes are themselves electroactive. Here we present results on the electroactivity, impedance properties and morphology of polypyrrole doped with p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene. The calixarene in the polymer was found to be irreversibly <b>oxidised</b> at <b>potentials</b> greater than 0. 500  V vs. SCE and reacted to form a new redox active species that was trapped within the polymer matrix. The results from the impedance and EQCM studies indicated that the calixarene was permanently trapped within the polymer matrix and the polymer acted as a cation exchange material. In addition, the data acquired from the EQCM experiments showed that while the material displayed simple cation exchange properties at high scan rates, at lower scan rates the transport of neutral species was also observed. Overall, our findings indicate that the PPy-C 4 S system is suitable for use as a stable conducting polymer doped with an immobile anion within the potential window of − 0. 800  V to 0. 500  V vs. SCE...|$|R

This study compared the effect of shield gas, elec-trode type and voltage/currect upon the dopamine and brain lipid peroxidation potential of selected welding fume, obtained from metal inert gas (MIG) welding systems.

40|$|The {{fluorescence}} intensities of tryptophan-like, tyrosine-like and humic-like {{materials were}} determined using excitation-emission-matrices (EEMs) {{for a wide}} range of samples including natural surface waters, sewage and industrial effluents and waters that have experienced known pollution events from the South West of England (n= 469). Fluorescence intensities reported in arbitrary fluorescence units (AFU) were correlated with standard five day Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD 5) values which were used as an indicator of the amount of biodegradable organic material present. Tryptophan-like fluorescence, which has been found to relate to the activity of the biological community, showed the strongest correlation with BOD 5. Fluorescence analysis of the tryptophan-like peak (excitation/ emission wavelength region 275 / 340 nm) is found to provide an accurate indication of the presence, and relative proportions of bioavailable organic material present (natural or anthropogenic). It therefore provides an insight relating to its oxygen depleting potential. Thus fluorescence spectroscopy is recommended as a portable or laboratory tool for the determination of the presence of biodegradable organic matter with intrinsic <b>oxidising</b> <b>potential</b> in natural waters. The novel application of eographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to the data illustrates that strong local relationships exist between the two parameters and that site specific character may be a strong factor in the strength of the tryptophan-like fluorescence/BOD 5 relationship...|$|E

IPNS is a non-haem iron(II) -dependent enzyme which utilises the full <b>oxidising</b> <b>potential</b> of molecular oxygen in catalysing the bicyclisation reaction. The reaction mechanism {{is believed to}} involve initial {{formation of}} the beta-lactam ring (via a thioaldehyde intermediate) to give an iron(IV) -oxo species, which then mediates closure of the 5 -membered thiazolidine ring. Results: Here we report experiments employing time-resolved crystallography to observe turnover of an isosteric substrate analogue designed to intercept the catalytic pathway at an early stage. Reaction in the crystalline enzyme-substrate complex was initiated by the application of high-pressure oxygen, and subsequent flash freezing allowed an oxygenated product to be trapped, bound at the iron centre. A mechanism for formation of the observed thiocarboxylate product is proposed. Conclusions: In the absence of its natural reaction partner (the N-H proton of the L-cysteinyl-D-valine amide bond), the proposed hydroperoxide intermediate appears to attack the putative thioaldehyde species directly. These results {{shed light on the}} events preceding P-lactam closure in the IPNS reaction cycle, and enhance our understanding of the mechanism for reaction of the enzyme with its natural substrate...|$|E
40|$|Amperometric {{detection}} {{provides a}} highly sensitive {{approach to the}} electroanalytical determination of many target molecules and is widely used in the laboratory and field {{as well as in}} the form of disposable sensors. However, the approach can occasionally be restricted by limitations of selectivity; various species present in the target medium may oxidise or reduce at similar potentials. We show that the use of conducting porous layers on the surface of electrodes can be used to modify the mass transport regime from linear (planar) diffusion to one of approximately 'thin layer' character and that this alteration can in favourable circumstances facilitate the amperometric discrimination between species which oxidise or reduce at similar potentials under planar diffusion conditions. The method is illustrated with respect to the detection of dopamine at naked glassy carbon electrodes and at such electrodes modified with a layer of multiwalled carbon nanotubes, and experiments are reported which are consistent with the proposed strategy. The literature for the electroanalytical amperometric detection of dopamine in the presence of interfering molecules such as uric acid, serotonin and ascorbic acid, which often are found to <b>oxidise</b> at <b>potentials</b> close to dopamine, is reviewed and the modus operandi for many chemically modified electrodes apparently designed for the sought resolution of dopamine from these species are found to possibly rely on the physical mechanism proposed. © 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|Microelectrode arrays are {{receiving}} particular attention. One very attractive {{feature is the}} possibility of electrochemical signal amplification by redox recyclisation of reversible electron mediators. For this purpose platinum microband electrodes have been fabricated in an interdigitated array with an interelectrode space of 2 Mym. At this distance each electrode (when polarised) is within the diffusion layer of the other electrode. Therefore oxidised and reduced forms of reversible redox couples can be repeatedly converted back and forward, when the respective potentials are applied at the electrode pairs. As a result the anodic and cathodic currents are increased. This principle of electrocatalytic signal amplification has been applied to the determination of alkaline phosphatase activity. The chosen enzyme substrate was p-aminophenol phosphate, which exhibits an irreversible oxidation peak in cyclic voltammetry at about + 450 mV versus Ag/AgCl. Whereas the product of the enzymatic hydrolysis p-aminophenol is reversibly <b>oxidised</b> at <b>potentials</b> around + 150 mV without interference from the parent phosphate ester. Amplification of the monitored anodic current is obtained when the second microband electrode of the interdigitated array is used as cathode, where p-aminophenol is immediately regenerated, thus entiring the next redox conversion cycle.

There is therefore great interest in developing routes for surface modification, and in understanding the influences, which such surface modifications produce. In the present work, an electrochemical procedure was developed to produce chemically stable negative electron affinity (NEA) surfaces. CVD diamond electrodes were electrochemically <b>oxidised</b> at anodic <b>potentials</b> to produce oxygen functionalities, which were subsequently subjected to ion exchange with aqueous Cs+ ions. Characterisation with XPS reveals the presence of a surface monolayer phase with the expected presence of Cs and O. The surface modified with Caesium displays negative electron affinity (NEA) and high field emission yields, and is much more stable than caesiated diamond surfaces produced by vacuum techniques.

40|$|The {{oxidative}} {{modification of}} low density lipoprotein (LDL) {{is a requirement}} {{for the development of}} atherosclerosis. Heinecke's group has shown immunologically that myeloperoxidase (MPO) is present in human atherosclerotic lesions, both extracellularly and intracellularly (Daugherty et al., 1994). The enzyme MPO has a potent <b>oxidising</b> <b>potential</b> and is responsible for a large number of the reactants produced during the immune response (Weiss, 1989). Therefore, the neutrophil enzyme MPO has recently been implicated in in vivo LDL oxidation. A few studies exist which suggest that MPO is capable of peroxidising lipids and free fatty acids directly via its peroxidase cycle (Hazell et al., 1994; Stelmaszynska et al., 1992). However, these studies only contain a small reference to this activity. Thus, it is not yet conclusively established whether MPO alone is capable of initiating lipid peroxidation, the primary objective of this study. The present study has demonstrated that myeloperoxidase and its model peroxidase, horseradish peroxidase, are capable of initiating lipid peroxidation of linoleic acid micelles. This raises the possibility that MPO has a physiological role in the oxidation of LDL and consequently atherosclerosis. It also has implications for other inflammatory diseases where it is a possibility that MPO induced lipid peroxidation may mediate tissue injury...|$|E
40|$|Dye decolourising peroxidases are {{the most}} recent family of haem peroxidases to be discovered. The <b>oxidising</b> <b>potential</b> of these enzymes {{is driven by the}} {{formation}} of ferryl intermediates that enables them to oxidise synthetic dye molecules that are widely used in the textile industry. We have investigated the catalytic cycle of a dye decolourising peroxidase (DtpA) from a biotechnologically important bacterium Streptomyces lividans. Using a combination of steady-state and stopped-flow kinetic investigations, we have determined the rate constants for all steps in the catalytic cycle with a range of substrate molecules. For most substrates, the value of k cat /K m measured by steady-state kinetics is equal to the slowest step in catalysis measured by stopped-flow spectroscopy, namely the decay of the ferryl Fe IV O species (compound II) to form the ferric species. With the anthraquinone-based dye, reactive blue 19 (RB 19) unusual steady-state kinetic behaviour is observed, which we propose through kinetic modelling of the catalytic cycle is due to a disproportionation mechanism of the dye. At low RB 19 concentrations, the rate of disproportionation is slower than that of the rate determining step in DtpA, whereas at higher concentrations of RB 19 the rate of disproportionation is faster. This mechanism obviates the need to postulate secondary sites for substrate binding on the enzyme which has been previously proposed for other dye decolourising haem peroxidases...|$|E
40|$|Controlled drug {{delivery}} {{has been widely}} researched since being introduced over 50 years ago. Systems for controlled release are important for improving the pharmacological profile of therapeutic compounds. Controlled delivery systems {{have been designed to}} give sustained and delayed release as well as for targeted delivery which minimises side effects such as toxicity, which can be associated with systemic {{drug delivery}}. Many materials have been used for controlled release, with the main focus being on polymer based systems. Over recent years conducting polymers have been used in controlled drug release applications. These materials possess unique redox switching properties which enable ionic compounds, including drugs, to be incorporated into and released from the polymer with electrochemical stimulation. To date, the use of conducting polymers in release systems has been focussed almost solely on polypyrrole. The work in this thesis focuses on another conducting polymer, polyterthiophene, for the incorporation and release of an anionic anti-inflammatory drug, dexamethasone phosphate (Dex). Dex was successfully incorporated into polyterthiophene as an anionic dopant during electrochemical synthesis. Due to the differing solubility of the drug and terthiophene monomer, synthesis was carried out from a mixed solvent system of water and acetonitrile. Characterisation showed that the presence of water in the monomer solution did not {{have a significant effect on}} the properties of the resulting polymer. Polymer synthesis conditions were optimised to yield reproducible polymer films which gave consistent Dex release profiles. The release of Dex was studied using arange of electrochemical stimulation protocols, with the oxidation state of the polyterthiophene found to be critical to the release observed. Polyterthiophene films were found to spontaneously reduce when immersed in electrolyte solution. Consequently, little difference in the release was observed between the unstimulated (spontaneously reduced) polymer and polyterthiophene which had been electrochemically reduced. However, the application of a constant <b>oxidising</b> <b>potential</b> was found to significantly reduce the rate of release from polyterthiophene. Several composite structures based on polyterthiophene doped with Dex were subsequently studied to determine whether this spontaneous reduction phenomenon could be changed or prevented. Bilayer structures prepared with an inner polyterthiophene layer and outer polypyrrole layer both doped with Dex were studied. Raman characterisation showed that some reduction of the inner polyterthiophene layer did occur. However, the Dex release profiles obtained for the bilayer structures were significantly different from those obtained for polyterthiophene mono layer structures, indicating that incorporating an outer polypyrrole layer could be used to affect release from the inner polyterthiophene layer. The use of carbon-based substrates was shown to stabilise the oxidation state of polyterthiophene doped with Dex in air, however, auto-reduction still occurred upon immersion in solution. Comparative release studies carried out using polypyrrole doped with Dex gave unique release results, with a significant amount of Dex release observed when a constant highly <b>oxidising</b> <b>potential</b> was applied to the polypyrrole film. Galvanic coupling with magnesium based alloys was shown as a means of stimulating drug release from polypyrrole and polyterthiophene/polypyrrole bilayer structures, removing the need for an external power source to stimulate release...|$|E

We investigated the effect of temperature (400 - 800 °C) on the type and the yield of the oxidative products, trapped in a cartridge, and gases collected in tedlar bags for subsequent FTIR analyses. The analyses of VOC, performed on a high resolution gas chromatograph-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (HRGC-QQQMS), identified 2 -methylbenzofuran and 3 -hydro- 2 -methylenebenzofuran as the initial products. This has been confirmed by injection of authentic standards and the application of collision induced dissociation (CID) that fragmented the isolated parent ions into specific product ions affording the identification of parent species.

40|$|Introduction: High {{perinatal}} calf mortality {{associated with}} gestational vitamin A deficiency {{has been reported}} during extended dry seasons in the Mitchell grass rangelands (Hill et al. 2009). Adding vitamin A to supplements may aid prevention however it is inherently sensitive to degradation. Stability depends upon the manufacturing conditions (heat, moisture and pH), <b>oxidising</b> <b>potential</b> of ingredients and storage conditions (Shurson et al. 2011). The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the stability of Vitamin A when included in dry season supplements manufactured using different methods. Methods: Three commercially available dry season supplements were manufactured using contrasting manufacturing methodologies; loose lick (LL), molten blocks (MB) and cold pour blocks (CB). All supplements were blended in a horizontal ribbon mixer. The LL supplements were decanted directly into 25 kg bags. The MB mixture was transferred to a heat jacketed mixing vessel, and then poured into cardboard cartons at 90 °C prior to hardening. Manufacturing of CB used a patented manufacturing method (IP No. 725349) under ambient temperature. The major ingredients in LL and MB were salt (275 - 300 g/kg as fed) and urea (250 - 300 g/kg). Composition of CB included 200 g/kg molasses, 150 g/kg urea and 100 g/kg salt. Rovimix® A 1000 (DSM) was included in each supplement to deliver 40 000 iu vitamin A/day. Expected concentrations were 240, 335, 270 iu Vitamin A/g for LL, MB and CB respectively. Samples were collected at day 0, 90 and 180 to determine Vitamin A status. Results and Discussion: Vitamin A degradation was both immediate and extensive for LL and MB relative to target concentrations (see Table 1). The levels decreased between manufacturing and day 90 for LL and MB (P< 0. 05), approaching the limit of detection by 180 days. Vitamin A concentrations of CB remained stable for the duration of the trial. The use of a CB manufacturing process is likely to have greater efficacy than either LL or MB when attempting to deliver vitamin A via dry season supplements...|$|E
40|$|High {{conductivity}} poly(3, 4 -ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was synthesised using vacuum {{vapour phase}} polymerization (VVPP). The process produces PEDOT composites which incorporate glycol within the polymer. To assess biocompatibility, {{a suite of}} analytical techniques were utilised {{in an effort to}} characterise the level of glycol present and its impact on cell attachment and proliferation. A small decrease in fibroblast cell attachment and proliferation was observed with increasing glycol content within the PEDOT composite. Keratinocyte cell attachment and proliferation by comparison showed an increase. As such, the results herein indicate that cell attachment and proliferation depends on the individual cell lines used and that the impact of glycol within the PEDOT composite is negligible. This positive outcome prompted investigation of this polymer as a platform for electro-stimulation work. Application of <b>oxidising</b> and reducing <b>potentials</b> to the PEDOT composite were utilised to examine the effect on biocompatibility.

These characteristics in the j-t curves suggest a different mechanism for the electro-oxidation of GHB, potential dependent, with a catalytic process at high potentials and an adsorption process controlled by mass transport at low potential. The change in the stationary current obtained at + 0. 9 V with variable GHB concentrations also suggests an oxidation mechanism catalysed by the platinum surface with platinum hydroxides acting as reaction intermediates to make the final oxidation product for GHB. The results obtained using chronoamperometry are in good agreement with those obtained using cyclic voltammetry where the alcohol group is <b>oxidised</b> at different <b>potentials.</b> In situ Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) spectra corresponding to GHB intermediates and water adsorbed species being formed/consumed at the potentialdependent adsorption processes have been analyzed using spectro-electrochemistry. A peak at 1590 cm- 1, corresponding to the asymmetric stretching of carboxylic group in a bridge configuration, increases with the potential. This supports the hypothesis of a mechanism of formation of the succinic acid on the platinum surface as reaction product under the experimental conditions studied...|$|R

The current study aimed at assessing environmental and human health risks related to urban {{waste management}} in Yamoussoukro, the political capital of Côte d’Ivoire. We undertook trans-disciplinary research within an Ecohealth approach, comprised of a participatory workshop with stakeholders and mapping of exposure patterns. A total of 492 randomly selected households participated in a cross-sectional survey. Waste deposit sites were characterised and 108 wastewater samples were subjected to laboratory examinations. The physico-chemical parameters of the surface water (temperature, pH, conductivity, <b>potential</b> <b>oxidise</b> reduction, BOD 5, COD, dissolved oxygen, nitrates, ammonia and total Kendal nitrogen) did not comply with World Health Organization standards of surface water quality. Questionnaire results showed that malaria was the most commonly reported disease. Diarrhoea and malaria were associated with poor sanitation. Households having dry latrines had {{a higher risk of}} diarrhoea (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 8, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 2 – 2. 7) compared to latrines with septic tanks and also a higher risk for malaria (OR = 1. 9, 95 % (CI) 1. 1 – 3. 3). Our research showed that combining health and environmental assessments enables a deeper understanding of environmental threats and disease burdens linked to poor waste management. Further study should investigate the sanitation strategy aspects that could reduce the environmental and health risks in the study area...|$|R
40|$|Deactivation {{behaviour}} of boron-doped diamond (BDD) {{had been}} extensively studied {{for the first}} time in three room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) namely 1 -ethyl- 3 -methyl imidazolium nonaflate (EMIN), triethylmethylammonium methyl sulphate (TEMAMS) and N-hexyl-N,N,N-triethylammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (N 2226 TFSI) along with glassy carbon (GC) and platinum (Pt) electrodes on the anodic oxidation of 2, 6 -dimethylphenol (2, 6 -DMP), 2, 4 -dimethylphenol (2, 4 -DMP) and 3, 4 -methylenedioxyphenol (3, 4 -MDP) using cyclic voltammetry (CV). Voltammetric studies reveal that the anodic potential limit of the electrodes decreases in the order GC > BDD > Pt in these media and EMIN shows the highest anodic limit among the three RTILs. Multisweep CV studies suggest that the three phenols show irreversible and reversible characteristics on the BDD and Pt electrodes respectively. On the other hand, they exhibit reversible redox behaviour in TEMAMS and irreversible nature in EMIN and N 2226 TFSI media on the GC electrode. The phenolic compounds get <b>oxidised</b> at higher <b>potential</b> on the BDD electrode followed by Pt and GC electrodes and their oxidation potential in the three media increases in the order: TEMAMS < EMIN < N 2226 TFSI. Anodic polarisation studies in presence of phenols suggests that the Pt and GC do not show any serious electrode fouling; however, the BDD gets deactivated severely, as noted from the I 4 pa/I 1 pa values. Passivation of the BDD electrode in the EMIN medium containing the 2, 6 -DMP was investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM).

40|$|The {{formation}} of nanostructured materials {{is an important}} field of research in materials science. While attention {{has been placed on}} the synthesis of inorganic or carbon-based materials, including carbon nanotubes, graphene and other nanostructures, the fabrication of metallic nanostructures is another key area of study. This research is largely driven by the different properties shown by the metals in their nanostructured form, where altered optical, electronic, catalytic and electrocatalytic behaviour is displayed compared with the bulk metal structure. Since the pioneering work of Haruta and co-workers on the catalytic activity of gold nanoparticles towards carbon monoxide oxidation, the synthesis and behaviour of a range of metallic and metal oxide nanostructures have been intensively studied. This has involved a host of fabrication methods, including chemical, electrochemical and biological methods, as well as physical methods such as evaporation and vapour deposition. Amongst these methods the electrochemical synthesis route provides a facile means to fabricate surface-bound metallic nanostructures with control over the morphology, shape and crystallographic orientation of the deposited material. This method can also avoid the contamination of the surface with capping agents which may alter the behaviour of the nanostructures. While much work has been performed on the synthesis, electrochemical behaviour and applications of electrodeposited metallic nanostructures, more research in this field is required to understand the complex nature of these nanomaterials. This includes the effects of the size, shape, crystallographic orientation, composition and porosity of the materials, and so the design of novel nanomaterials with properties tailored towards important applications requires a more complete understanding of these surface properties. Another important property of metal surfaces is the ability to <b>oxidise</b> at <b>potentials</b> lower than that expected for the bulk surface. This activity, known as premonolayer oxidation, has been reported to occur in the double layer region of a number of metal surfaces such as gold, silver, platinum, palladium, copper and ruthenium, and has been postulated to be caused by the oxidation of low lattice coordinated atoms or clusters of atoms on the metal surface known as active sites. The premonolayer oxidation of these active sites is closely related to the electrocatalytic activity towards a range of important electrocatalytic reactions, however due to their often low coverage and complex nature further study is required to better understand and synthesise more effective materials for these applications. The aims of this current research are to study the active site behaviour of gold and platinum nanomaterials, as these represent two important electrocatalytically active materials which are known to undergo premonolayer oxidation. As active sites are thought to be located at defects in the bulk surface structure and may be promoted at the disrupted surfaces present on nanostructures, the {{formation of}} novel gold and platinum nanostructures was performed as a means to increase the presence of active sites. Electrodeposition was chosen as a means of fabricating these nanostructured materials, especially as uncapped metallic nanostructures may be formed and allow a direct study of the active sites present on the surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The surface redox behaviour, the stability, and the electro-oxidation of CO on model platinum-tin surface alloy {{catalysts}} {{has been}} studied by ex situ electrochemical measurements. The Pt(111) -Sn(2 x 2) and Pt(111) -Sn(root 3 x root 3) R 30 degrees surfaces have been prepared and characterised in UHV by vapour deposition of Sri on Pt(111) and the surfaces subsequently transferred for electrochemical investigation. A surface redox couple, which {{is associated with the}} adsorption/desorption of hydroxide on the Sn sites, is observed at 0. 28 V(RHE) / 0. 15 V(RHE) in H 2 SO 4 electrolyte on both surfaces. Evidence that it is associated with the adsorption of OH comes from ex situ photoemission measurements, which indicate that the Sri atoms are in a metallic state at potentials below 0. 15 V(RHE), and an <b>oxidised</b> state at <b>potentials</b> above 0. 28 (RHE). Specific adsorption of sulphate anions is not associated with the surface process since there is no evidence from photoemission of sulphate adsorption, and the same surface couple is observed in HClO 4 electrolyte. A second surface redox couple, associated with further oxidation of the Sn sites in the alloy surfaces. is observed at 0. 8 V(RHE) / 0. 58 V(RHE). CO is adsorbed from solution at 300 K, with saturation coverages of 0. 37 +/- 0. 05 ML and 0. 2 +/- 0. 05 ML. respectively. The adsorbed CO is oxidatively stripped at the potential coincident with the adsorption of hydroxide on the tin sites at the lower potential of 0. 28 V(RHE). This strong promotional effect is unambiguously associated with the bi-functional mechanism. The Sri induced activation of water. and promotion of CO electro-oxidation, is sustained as long as the alloy structure remains intact, in the potential range below 0. 5 V(RHE). The instability of the alloy surface at higher potentials is associated with the second redox couple. The redox behaviour at higher potentials is modified by the presence of CO in stripping experiments, with couples now observed at 0. 78 V(RHE) / 0. 56 V(RHE), and 0. 9 V(RHE) / 0. 70 V(RHE). This behaviour may be associated with enhanced oxidation through the exclusion of sulphate anions at the surface by CO...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a novel theory of electrocatalysis at metal (especially noble metal) /solution {{interfaces}} was developed {{based on the}} assumption of metal adatom/incipient hydrous oxide cyclic redox transitions. Adatoms are considered as metastable, low coverage species that <b>oxidise</b> in-situ at <b>potentials</b> of often significantly cathodic to the regular metal/metal oxide transition. Because the adatom coverage is so low the electrochemical or spectroscopic response for oxidation is frequently overlooked; however, the product of such oxidation, referred to here as incipient hydrous oxide seems to be the important mediator {{in a wide variety of}} electrocatalytically demanding oxidation processes. Conversely, electrocatalytically demanding reductions apparently occur only at adatom sites at the metal/solution interface - such reactions generally occur only at potentials below, i. e. more cathodic than, the adatom/hydrous oxide transition. It was established that while silver in base oxidises in a regular manner (forming initially OHads species) at potentials above 1. 0 V (RHE), there is a minor redox transition at much lower potentials, ca. o. 35 v (RHE). The latter process is assumed to an adatom/hydrous oxide transition and the low coverage Ag(l) hydrous oxide (or hydroxide) species was shown to trigger or mediate the oxidation of aldehydes, e. g. HCHO. The results of a study of this system were shown to be in good agreement with a kinetic model based on the above assumptions; the similarity between this type of behaviour and enzyme-catalysed processes - both systems involve interfacial active sites - was pointed out. Similar behaviour was established for gold where both Au(l) and Au(lll) hydrous oxide mediators were shown to be the effective oxidants for different organic species. One of the most active electrocatalytic materials known at the present time is platinum. While the classical view of this high activity is based on the concept of activated chemisorption (and the important role of the latter is not discounted here) a vital role is attributed to the adatom/hydrous oxide transition. It was suggested that the well known intermediate (or anomalous) peak in the hydrogen region of the cyclic voltanmogram for platinum region is in fact due to an adatom/hydrous oxide transition. Using potential stepping procedures to minimise the effect of deactivating (COads) species, it was shown that the onset (anodic sweep) and termination (cathodic sweep) potential for the oxidation of a wide variety of organics coincided with the potential for the intermediate peak. The converse was also shown to apply; sluggish reduction reactions, that involve interaction with metal adatoms, occur at significant rates only in the region below the hydrous oxide/adatom transition...|$|R
40|$|Comunicação da qual só está disponível o resumo. Laccase {{mediator}} system (LMS) {{was applied}} to one industrial Eucalyptus globulus kraft pulp with kappa numbers 15. 2, using violuric acid (VA) as mediator. The objective of the present work is to quantify {{the influence of the}} reaction conditions on the delignification rate and extent, establishing the kinetic equations. The effects of oxygen pressure, laccase and mediator charges, and reaction time on delignification were evaluated. The kinetic studies were carried out in a 1. 5 L jacketed reactor with temperature control and magnetic mixer. The experiments were carried out with 10 grams of pulp at very low consistency (0. 6 %) in order to minimize inter-fibre mass transfer resistances. The oxygen pressure was varied between 1 and 7 bar and no significant differences were observed in terms of delignification rate and extent, at a given charge of laccase and mediator. The laccase (EC 1. 10. 3. 2) charge was ranged between 10 and 250 IU per gram of pulp and the mediator between 10 and 70 mg per gram of pulp. The presence of mediator is required because the enzyme cannot diffuse into the porous structure of the fibre wall, where lignin should be <b>oxidised.</b> The delignification <b>potential</b> of the LMS was evaluated by measuring the kappa number of the pulp, after alkaline extraction. Control tests similar to the LMS followed by alkaline extraction, but without enzyme, were carried out and the mean value of kappa number was 14. 04. The decrease of the kappa number of the pulp from 15. 2 to 14. 04 can be interpreted as the consequence of the extraction of some fragments of lignin during the two stages. This procedure enable us to access the real effect of laccase. The hexeneuronic acid (HexA) has, particularly in hardwood pulps, an important contribution to the kappa number value. However, the experimental data have shown that LMS does not remove significantly the HexA, which is in good agreement with the literature. So, the kappa number can be used to evaluate the potential of LMS to lignin extraction. For the levels of laccase 50 IU per gram and 40 mg of VA per gram, the delignification was reached 37 %, which is a good result. The profile of kappa number with reaction time follows an exponential trend. In addition, the initial rate methodology is being used to quantify the influence of laccase and mediator concentrations on the kinetic rate. The data have shown that the delignification rate exhibits a linear dependence on the mediator concentration, for the low range tested. The effect of laccase charge seems to be lower. The experimental data are under exploitation...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) In this thesis, we have {{investigated}} the thermal decomposition of the pyrethroid, alpha-cypermethrin, and two cognate molecules of biphenyl and dibenzo-p-dioxin (DD), into toxic products including polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/F, dioxins). Alpha-cypermethrin has widespread indoor and outdoor applications while biphenyl is mostly used as a fungicide and termiticide. Based on these results, a mechanism has been developed in which the key reaction steps occurring during pyrolysis and oxidation of alpha-cypermethrin are outlined. With the aim of gaining better and more comprehensive understanding {{of the formation of}} PCDD/F and destruction of DD, we examined a range of reaction conditions using a bench type tubular reactor facility, with particular focus on varying oxygen levels, temperatures and residence times. Stable reaction products were identified and quantitated using a range of analytical techniques and equipment, including micro gas chromatograph (µGC), triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (QQQMS), ion trap mass spectrometer (ITMS), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. For some key reaction steps, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were deployed to help unravel the reaction mechanism. Initially, we studied the pyrolysis of alpha-cypermethrin in the temperature range of 300 to 600 °C. We identified five main gaseous species including hydrogen chloride, hydrogen cyanide, methyl cyanide, acetaldehyde and crotonaldehyde. We identified two major pathways, one at low temperatures (two species form only at 450 °C) and the other at higher temperatures (formation of naphthalene and ethylbenzene, possibly by reaction with radicals, expulsion of CO and internal rearrangement, rather than by breaking of ether bridges). The unimolecular rearrangement of alpha-cypermethrin was observed at low temperatures, dominating over the alternative pathway which involves the recombination of the initial products. To gain further understanding of this pathway, we performed DFT computations, at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G(d) level of theory, to understand the role of the CN group in O-CH(CN) bond fission in alpha-cypermethrin, in comparison to fission of the same bond in permethrin. There is a significant lowering of the bond energy which is due to considerable stabilisation of the CH(CN) C₆H₅ radical compared with the benzyl radical formed in the permethrin model case. Consequently, the activation energy for O—CHCN fission in cypermethrin is relatively similar to the activation energy for internal rearrangement and aromatisation. Hence, bond fission in alpha-cypermethrin should predominate at a much lower temperature than in permethrin itself, exactly as observed in the present experiments. The oxidative pyrolysis of alpha-cypermethrin generates substantially more PCDF than PCDD under all experimental conditions (temperatures, residence times and equivalence ratio), with the maximum emission factor of PCDD/F being observed at 550 °C, a residence time of 5 s and an equivalence ratio of 0. 03. As indicated by the homologue distribution of PCDD/F, all the chlorinated congeners were detected with the exception of octachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and octachlorinated furans (OCDD/F) in our measurements. The VOC analysis revealed the production of benzene, phenol, chlorotoluenes, trichlorophenols, tetrachlorophenols. The formation of PCDD/F from the gas-phase oxidation of alpha-cypermethrin may proceed through the coupling of chlorophenoxy radicals to benzene or chlorinated benzenes, and the self-condensation of chlorophenoxy radicals. This study combines the results of experimental measurements and theoretical computations to investigate the initial steps in the oxidation of dibenzo-p-dioxin (DD). The analyses of VOC, performed on a high resolution gas chromatograph-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (HRGC-QQQMS), identified 2 -methylbenzofuran and 2, 3 -dihydro- 2 -methylenebenzofuran as the initial products. This has been confirmed by injection of authentic standards and the application of collision induced dissociation that fragmented the isolated parent ions into specific product ions affording the identification of parent species. The oxidative decomposition of DD initiated at around 450 °C, with the evolution of VOC being maximum between 650 and 700 °C. At temperatures in excess of 750 °C, all VOCs were completely <b>oxidised.</b> The <b>potential</b> energy surface, based on the density functional theory of B 3 LYP, mapped the initial steps involved in the oxidation of DD, and yielded a detailed reaction scheme for the onset of oxidation of DD that results in the formation of 2 -methylbenzofuran and 2, 3 -dihydro- 2 -methylenebenzofuran. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of the oxidation of biphenyl at low temperatures. Although it has been known for several years that combustion of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) in accidental fires of electrical equipment and in municipal waste can lead to significant emissions of dioxins, understanding of the mechanism of the oxidation process is quite limited. Oxidation of biphenyl (as a prototype model compound for PCB) in an alumina reactor at 490 ºC yields the initial products dibenzofuran and benzaldehyde which have been confirmed in GC/MS studies. It is postulated that O₂ (¹Δg) whose formation is catalysed by the reactor surfaces, initiates the reaction at this relatively low temperature. Quantum chemical computations of the reaction potential energy surfaces suggest low energy pathways to the observed initial products...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} electrocatalysts for the oxygen {{evolution}} reaction for proton-exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Water electrolysis {{is considered the}} only viable option for large-scale hydrogen production. Hydrogen is a relevant storage medium for renewable energy technologies. The oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) is {{a major source of}} loss in PEM water electrolysis, and currently costly catalysts such as iridium oxide, an oxide with a rutile structure, are employed. Optimum use of the catalyst as well as development of alternative ones are considered to be preconditioned by establishing a rational fundamental understanding of these catalysts. The thesis investigates two different forms of iridium oxide, one nanostructured form synthesised through colloidal techniques and passive films formed on iridium metal (AIROF), and compares their electronic structure and electrocatalytic properties. The investigations take departure in the reported ability of AIROF to switch from a metallic behaviour at positive <b>potentials</b> (<b>oxidised</b> state, above approximately 0 : 8 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode) to a semiconducting form at low potentials (reduced state). For AIROF in a solution of Fe(CN) 6 - 3 /- 4   and sulphuric acid the reduction currents associated with the redox couple are thus much smaller than the oxidation currents, clearly related to a poor alignment of the oxidised part of the redox couple with the valence band of the reduced oxide. The electrochemical characteristics of oxidation and reduction of hexacyanoferrate redox couples at nanostructured iridium oxide produced by hydrolysis (hIrO 2) are, however, similar to a metal electrode. In view of also {{significant differences between the two}} oxides’ optical and intercalation properties, this strongly indicates that hIrO 2 has a different bulk electronic structure. Yet, the charge-normalised electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen-evolution reaction at AIROF and hIrO 2 are the same. This indicates that the electrocatalytic properties of iridium oxide are a function of the local structure at the oxide surface and not uniquely related to the bulk electronic structure. Some of the measurements of the nanostructured oxide were performed at Nafion ® -containing composite polymer-oxide electrodes, and for interpretation of these it is important to assess the possible influences of the Nafion ® electrolyte on the results. Thus, in a solution of the same redox couple and TFMSA the AIROF electrode shows no cathodic ”blocking” of the faradaic current and behaves similarly to a metal electrode. In ferrate-free solutions Mott-Schottky plots revealed no significant changes in the flatband potential in TFMSA as compared to H 2 SO 4. The results still indicate stronger sulphate adsorption since higher rates for the oxygen evolution reaction and formation of insoluble ferrate-decomposition products in solutions containing TFMSA than in H 2 SO 4. The absence of cathodic ”blocking” in TFMSA is suggested to be due to exposure of free iridium substrate, of which the area is estimated to 1 % of the electrode area, an inferences about the electronic structure of such oxides should pay due attention to the effects of the supporting electrolyte. However, in terms of electronic structure, the conclusion that the electronic structures of the two oxides are different remains. In view of these results, we also attempted to investigate possible conductivity changes in the nanostructured oxide through impedance analysis. To interpret the results, a mathematical model for the impedance of porous intercalation electrodes of mixed conductivity was employed, part of which was derived within the current work. The model is based on an agglomerate model and dilute-solution theory. The model was used to interpret impedance data collected for the nanostructured iridium oxide (NIRO) at potentials below those at which the oxygen evolution reaction commences. The measurements included thin oxide films covered by a protective NafionR layer and thicker composite Nafion ® -oxide electrodes. The time constants for the low frequency diffusion process were approximately the same for both types of electrodes, indicating diffusion in individual particles in the porous electrode rather than across the film. The impedance data indicated that there were no significant variations in conductivity of the oxides with potential, as opposed to what appears to be the case for AIROF. This is interpreted to reflect differences in electronic structure between the nanostructured oxide and AIROF. In conclusion we find strong evidence that the (bulk) electronic structure of the nanostructured iridium oxide is quite different from that of AIROF. In view of the normalised electrocatalytic activity of the two oxides being approximately the same, this restricts the use of correlations based on bulk electronic structure and electrocatalytic activity.
