5|$|The war was one {{of several}} near {{simultaneous}} wars waged by the Mongol Empire and the Yuan dynasty in the late 13th century.

5|$|When {{it became}} clear in the 1950s that the library had outgrown its {{existing}} building, the school initially hired an architect who proposed a traditional design for the new building. Deciding instead to construct a library with a contemporary design, the school gave the commission to Louis Kahn in 1965. The library was opened in 1971.

5|$|The New York {{classical}} music scene included Charles Griffes, originally from Elmira, New York, who began publishing his most innovative material in 1914. His early collaborations were attempts to use non-Western musical themes. The best-known New York composer was George Gershwin. Gershwin was a songwriter with Tin Pan Alley and the Broadway theatres, and his works were {{strongly influenced by}} jazz, or rather the precursors to jazz that were extant during his time. Gershwin's work made American {{classical music}} more focused, and attracted an unheard of amount of international attention. Following Gershwin, the first major composer was Aaron Copland from Brooklyn, who used elements of American folk music, though it remained European in technique and form. Later, {{he turned to the}} ballet and then serial music. Charles Ives was one of the earliest American classical composers <b>of</b> <b>enduring</b> international significance, producing music in a uniquely American style, though his music was mostly unknown until after his death in 1954.|$|E
5|$|This king {{established}} a number <b>of</b> <b>enduring</b> traditions in Imerina. A law imposing a fine on a homeowner whose house fire destroys neighboring property was promulgated by Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana. He also established {{the rule that}} all citizens of Ambohimanga or Antananarivo should pass to offer hasina to the sovereign and wish him or her a long life if a fire ever broke out in their city, and that citizens should likewise congratulate the owners of houses that were spared from destruction if a fire had occurred nearby. He designated specific areas where water could be drawn for use in royal circumcision ceremonies. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana also created three formal ways of pronouncing a sacred and binding oath; these included the mively rano (striking {{the surface of a}} body of water with a stick), the milefon'omby (striking a calf with a spear) and the misotro vokaka (drinking water mixed with ashes taken from a king's tomb). After capturing Ambohitrabiby, he obliged all the andriana (nobles) and other powerful figures in the community there to formalize their allegiance to him by enacting one of these oaths.|$|E
5|$|The {{prospect}} <b>of</b> <b>enduring</b> overlordship {{from nearby}} Leinster, {{as compared to}} the more distant and anaemic overlordship of Munster, appears to have compelled the Dubliners to oppose the Leinstermen. The ensuing battle itself is recorded by both the fifteenthsixteenth-century Annals of Ulster and the eleventhfourteenth-century Annals of Inisfallen, which reveal that it was Domnall himself who marshalled the forces of Munster to victory. Considering Munster's weakened state, his triumph in Dublin was remarkable achievement. Unfortunately for Donnchad, however, he lost his life in the encounter; and according to the thirteenth-century ecclesiast Giraldus Cambrensis (died 1220×1223), the Dubliners added insult to injury by burying his corpse with that of a dog as a show of contempt to the Leinstermen. There is uncertainty as to when Domnall originally gained the kingship of Dublin. His father could have installed him as such upon assuming the Irish high-kingship, or perhaps following the aforesaid ousting of Gofraid Crobán in 1094although it is not impossible that Domnall mac Taidc was installed as king at this point instead. Another possibility is that Domnall had been appointed king not long before his victory over the Leinstermenperhaps upon his father's failing health in 1114or else not long after his successful defence of Dublin. Whatever the case, the evidence of Domnall's kingship indicates that Muirchertach Ua Briain was the third consecutive claimant to the high-kingship to appoint an intended successor to the kingship of Dublin.|$|E
