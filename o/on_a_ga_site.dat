40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{properties}} of Be dopants in GaN using first principles calculations. Substitutional Be <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Ga</b> <b>site</b> acts as an acceptor, but interstitial Be poses a potential problem because of its low formation energy and donor character. We study the diffusion of interstitial Be and find it to be highly anisotropic. We also study the formation of complexes between substitutional and interstitial Be, and between substitutional Be and hydrogen. We have calculated the Be-H vibrational modes to aid in experimental identification of such complexes...|$|E

Formation energies of Si <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Ga</b> <b>site</b> and O on an N site are calculated at {{two levels of}} theory using conventional thermochemical and kinetic exchange and correlation density functionals (B 97 - 2 and BB 1 k). We confirm the shallow donor nature of these substitutional defects. We find that the 0 / 1 + transition levels for both Si and O species lie well above {{the bottom of the}} conduction band, in agreement with previous supercell-based simulations. The origin of this artifact is discussed in the context of relevant experimental results and we show how correct in-gap shallow levels can be ascertained in good agreement with experiment...|$|E
40|$|Using first-principles total-energy methods, we {{investigate}} Jahn-Teller distortions in III-V dilute magnetic semiconductors, GaAs:Mn and GaN:Mn in the cubic zinc blende structure. The results for an isolated Mn impurity <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Ga</b> <b>site</b> {{show that there}} is no appreciable effect in GaAs, whereas, in GaN there is a Jahn-Teller effect in which the symmetry around the impurity changes from T$_{d}$ to D$_{ 2 d}$ or to C$_{ 2 v}$. The large effect in GaN occurs because of the localized d$^ 4 $ character, which is further enhanced by the distortion. The lower symmetry should be detectable experimentally in cubic GaN with low Mn concentration, and should be affected by charge compensation (reductions of holes and conversion of Mn ions to d$^ 5 $ with no Jahn-Teller effect). Jahn-Teller effect is greatly reduced because the symmetry at each Mn site is lowered due to the Mn-Mn interaction. The tendency toward ferromagnetism is found to be stronger in GaN:Mn than in GaAs:Mn and to be only slightly reduced by charge compensation. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Structures, {{electronic}} and magnetic prop-erties of Mn and Mn 2 doped stoichiometric (GaO) n clusters with n = 1 - 7 are {{studied in the}} framework of density functional theory. Doping of a Mn atom is found to be energetically favorable in (GaO) n clusters and the equilibrium configurations are found to be determined by the metal–oxygen interactions. Mn prefers to maximize the number of Mn–O bonds by selecting <b>a</b> <b>Ga</b> <b>site</b> in the cluster which increases its coordination with oxygen. Addition of a Mn atom in Mn(GaO) n clusters results into the ground state to be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic depending on the Mn coordination number and the Mn–Mn bond-length in the given Mn 2 (GaO) n cluster...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{comparison}} is presented between Eu implanted and Eu in situ doped GaN thin films showing that two predominant Eu sites are optically active around 620 nm in {{both types of}} samples with below and above bandgap excitation. One of these <b>sites,</b> identified as <b>a</b> <b>Ga</b> substitutional <b>site,</b> is common to both types of Eu doped GaN samples despite {{the difference in the}} GaN film growth method and in the doping technique. High-resolution photoluminescence (PL) spectra under resonant excitation reveal that in all samples these two host-sensitized sites are in small amount compared to the majority of Eu ions which occupy isolated <b>Ga</b> substitutional <b>sites</b> and thus cannot be excited through the GaN host. The relative concentrations of the two predominant host-sensitized Eu sites are strongly affected by the annealing temperature for Eu implanted samples and by the group III element time opening in the molecular beam epitaxy growth. Red luminescence decay characteristics for the two Eu sites reveal different excitation paths. PL dynamics under above bandgap excitation indicate that Eu ions occupying <b>a</b> <b>Ga</b> substitutional <b>site</b> are either excited directly into the 5 D 0 level or into higher excited levels such as 5 D 1, while Eu ions sitting in the other site are only directly excited into the 5 D 0 level. These differences are discussed in terms of the spectral overlap between the emission band of a nearby bound exciton and the absorption bands of Eu ions. The study of Eu doped GaN quantum dots reveals the existence of only one type of Eu site under above bandgap excitation, with Eu PL dynamics features similar to Eu ions in <b>Ga</b> substitutional <b>sites...</b>|$|R
