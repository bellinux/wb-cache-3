5|$|In April 1864, Beauregard {{saw little}} {{opportunity}} for military glory because he foresaw {{that there would}} be no more significant assaults against Charleston, and prospects for a major field command were unlikely. He requested a leave to recover from fatigue and a chronic throat ailment, but he instead received an order to report to Weldon, North Carolina, near the Virginia border, to play a key role in the defense of Virginia. His new assignment, the Department <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> Cape Fear, also included Virginia south of the James River. When he took command on April 18, he renamed it, on his own initiative, the Department <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> Southern Virginia. The Confederates were preparing for the spring offensive of Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and were concerned that attacks south of Richmond could interrupt the critical supply lines to Richmond and the army of Robert E. Lee.|$|E
5|$|A herd {{lives on}} the Rachel Carson {{component}} of the North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserve, a series of five small islands and several salt marshes.

5|$|In 1831, {{the first}} gold dollar was minted, at the private mint of Christopher Bechtler in North Carolina. Much {{of the gold}} then being {{produced}} in the United States came from the mountains <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> Georgia, and the dollars and other small gold coins issued by Bechtler circulated through that region, and were now and then seen further away. Additional one-dollar pieces were struck by August Bechtler, Christopher's son.|$|E
5|$|After {{continuing}} through the southeast United States, the storm became extratropical {{near the border}} <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> Virginia midday on September18. Although it initially maintained tropical storm-force winds, the former hurricane weakened below gale-force on September19 while it was near Philadelphia. The storm continued rapidly to the northeast, moving through New England and {{along the coast of}} Maine before turning more to the east. Late on September19, the storm moved across Nova Scotia, passing southeast of Newfoundland the next day. It was last observed late on September20 dissipating to the east of Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|He {{fell to the}} 413th {{overall pick}} in the 14th round, {{selected}} by the Anaheim Angels. Angels scout Dan Radcliff and director of scouting Eddie Bane convinced Adenhart to forego a scholarship offer from the University <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> signed him to a $710,000 bonus ($ in 2010) on July 26, 2004. After having Dr. James Andrews perform the Tommy John surgery, Adenhart spent the next year rehabilitating his elbow at the Angels' rehab facility in Tempe, Arizona. During that time, Adenhart also attended classes at Arizona State University.|$|E

5|$|In early 1863, Major General James Longstreet {{was given}} {{command of the}} Confederate Department <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> Southern Virginia. His {{objectives}} were to defend Richmond from attack from the southeast, forage for supplies in Union controlled southeastern Virginia and to dislodge the Union garrison at Suffolk. Longstreet began the Siege of Suffolk on April 11, 1863. The 6th Massachusetts occupied {{a position on the}} right of the Union defensive siege lines at a location called Fort Nansemond by the bank of the Nansemond River. For 22 days, the regiment engaged in frequent exchanges of fire with opposing forces though no significant assault was made by the Confederates.|$|E

5|$|The NHC {{forecasts}} for Emily {{were generally}} accurate. On August29, {{two days before}} the storm's closest approach, the NHC issued a hurricane watch from Cape Romain, South Carolina, to Fenwick Island, Delaware, including the Albemarle and Pamlico sounds of North Carolina as well as the Chesapeake Bay south of the Patuxent River. The next day, the watch was discontinued south of Little River, South Carolina. A hurricane warning was issued from Bogue Inlet to the border <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> Virginia on August30, and was extended a day later to Cape Henlopen, Delaware. The watches and warnings were canceled as Emily turned out to sea.|$|E

5|$|Thereafter, the {{hurricane}} began to weaken while moving across Florida, falling to Category1 intensity only several hours after landfall late on September15. Eventually, it curved north-northeastward {{and approached the}} east coast of Florida again. Late on September16, the storm emerged into the Atlantic near St. Augustine and weakened to a tropical storm early on the following day. The cyclone made another landfall near the Georgia-South Carolina state line later on September17. The system continued to weaken and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone near the border <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> Virginia early on September18.|$|E

As of January 2016, there are 464 species and a species pair definitively included in the official list. Twelve additional species, {{one of which is}} identified only at the genus level, are on the list but classed as provisional. Of the 476 species, 84 are rare anywhere in the state, 81 are rare in some part of the state or in a single season, six have been introduced to North America, and four are extinct.|$|E
5|$|To prevent {{overpopulation}} and inbreeding, and {{to protect}} their habitat from being overgrazed, the horses are managed by the National Park Service, the state <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina,</b> <b>and</b> several private organizations. The horses are monitored for diseases, such as equine infectious anemia, an outbreak of which was discovered and subsequently eliminated on Shackleford in 1996. They are safeguarded from traffic on North Carolina Highway 12. Island populations are limited by adoptions and by birth control. Bankers taken from the wild and trained {{have been used for}} trail riding, driving, and occasionally for mounted patrols.|$|E

5|$|Tucker's {{maritime}} {{roots in}} Bermuda instilled {{an interest in}} navigation, and he began an intense campaign with the legislatures <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> Virginia to improve the waterways to Norfolk along the Roanoke, Dan, and Staunton Rivers, {{in order to avoid}} inefficient portage required to Petersburg and Richmond. This effort culminated in his own bids for election to a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates representing Pittsylvania County, which failed in 1813 and 1814 but then succeeded in 1816. Tucker and Maria then suffered the first loss of a child, Harriett, from whooping cough at age three.|$|E
5|$|While {{bypassing}} the Outer Banks, Emily produced strong winds that coincided with high tides during a full moon, causing severe flooding along the Pamlico Sound. In Buxton, the floods left behind water marks {{as high as}} , and the entire villages of Avon and Hatteras were inundated. The storm downed thousands of trees and wrecked 553homes—168 of which completely destroyed—leaving {{a quarter of the}} Cape Hatteras population homeless. Structural damage in North Carolina was estimated at $35million. Along the coasts <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> Virginia, three swimmers drowned as a result of Emily.|$|E
5|$|According to The Intellectual in Twentieth-Century Southern Literature, Godwin {{was unusual}} {{in that she}} was a popular novelist that was also working in academia. Godwin taught at the University of Illinois Center for Advanced Studies from 1971 to 1972. During her time as an author, she was also a {{lecturer}} at the Iowa Writers' Workshop (1972 to 1973), Vassar College (1977), and Columbia University (1978/1981). She acted as chair of the fiction panel for the National Book Awards in 1986 and 2008. In 1989, Godwin also founded a small publishing house called St. Hilda's Press. It published religious texts not printed by more commercialized publishers.

5|$|Although {{the center}} of Gustav passed just {{to the east of}} Cape Hatteras, areas <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> southeastern Virginia {{experienced}} heavy rain and tropical storm force winds. Parts of the Outer Banks received 2–5inches (50–125mm) of rain and winds of up to 50mph (80km/h), and the Coast Guard station at Cape Hatteras reported a wind gust of 78mph (125km/h). The storm produced storm surges of 3– along the Outer Banks, and 1– along the southeastern coast of Virginia. These surges, combined with strong winds and high sea swells, resulted in minor flooding, mainly in Ocracoke and Hatteras Village, North Carolina. A weak waterspout also touched down on Silver Lake near Ocracoke and moved onshore, but only minor roof damage was reported. Sporadic power outages were also reported. One person died after suffering injuries in the high surf, and 40 other people had to be rescued from riptides and storm surges. Damage in the region amounted to $100,000 (2002USD).|$|E
5|$|Due to {{uncertainties}} {{about how}} the region's subtropical ridge would interact with Irene, the models continued to give unclear signals of the storm's future. Some of the models predicted that Irene would make landfall in North Carolina, while others continued to anticipate that Irene would dissipate. The uncertainty ended when a weakness in the subtropical ridge allowed Irene to turn sharply northward, which caused the storm to pass midway between the Outer Banks <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> Bermuda on August 15. Soon after, upper-level shear weakened greatly, and Irene rapidly intensified, first to a hurricane, then to its peak strength as a 105mph (170km/h) Category 2 hurricane {{on the afternoon of}} August 16, while located 350miles (560km) northeast of Bermuda; {{at the same time it}} also attained minimum pressure of 970mbar. Though NHC meteorologists thought it was likely that Irene would become a hurricane, they were not expecting an intensification of such a magnitude.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} spring of 1863, Longstreet {{suggested}} to Lee that his corps be detached from the Army of Northern Virginia and sent to reinforce the Army of Tennessee, where Gen. Braxton Bragg was being challenged in Middle Tennessee by Union Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans, Longstreet's roommate at West Point. It is possible that Longstreet believed that an independent command in the West offered better opportunities for advancement than a corps under Lee's shadow. Lee did detach two divisions from the First Corps, but ordered them to Richmond, not Tennessee. Seaborne movements of the Union IX Corps potentially threatened vital ports on the mid-Atlantic coast. The division of George Pickett started for the capital in mid-February, was followed by John Hood's, and then Longstreet himself was told to take command of the detached divisions and the Departments <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> Southern Virginia.|$|E
