5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé can be {{difficult}} to diagnose from symptoms alone, because hereditary renal cancers, pneumothorax, and cutaneous tumors <b>occur</b> <b>with</b> other syndromes. Hereditary bilateral, multifocal kidney tumors similar to those seen in BHDcan <b>occur</b> <b>with</b> von Hippel–Lindau disease (clear cell renal cell carcinoma), hereditary papillary renal cancer (papillary renal cell carcinoma), and hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome. They are differentiated with examination of the tumors' histology.|$|E

5|$|Enlargement of the spleen {{may occur}} in AML, {{but it is}} {{typically}} mild and asymptomatic. Lymph node swelling is rare in AML, in contrast to acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The skin is involved about 10% {{of the time in}} the form of leukemia cutis. Rarely, Sweet's syndrome, a paraneoplastic inflammation of the skin, can <b>occur</b> <b>with</b> AML.|$|E
5|$|Hereditary {{recurrent}} pneumothorax or pulmonary cysts {{are associated}} with Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, and cystic fibrosis. Non-hereditary recurrent pneumothorax and/or pulmonary cysts can <b>occur</b> <b>with</b> Langerhans cell histiocytosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. These conditions are differentiated from Birt–Hogg–Dubé through examining the patient history and performing a physical examination. In women suspected to have the disease, ruling out pulmonary or thoracic endometriosis may be necessary.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, Amanita ceciliae is {{widespread}} everywhere, though infrequently encountered. It often inhabits deciduous forests with hornbeam (Carpinus), oak (Quercus), beech (Fagus) and birch (Betula), {{but it can}} also rarely <b>occur</b> <b>with</b> conifers: pine (Pinus), fir (Abies), spruce (Picea) and cedar (Cedrus). It has a preference for neutral to calcareous soils.|$|E
5|$|In his {{lab at the}} Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Nuttin {{designed}} {{experiments to}} test the hypothesis that people place a higher value on letters that feature in their name. It was crucial to the experimental design to rule out other factors, particularly mere exposure. If letters in a name are also letters that <b>occur</b> <b>with</b> higher frequency, then a preference for one's own letters might arise from the mere-exposure effect.|$|E

5|$|Abstinence-only sex {{education}} does not reduce teenage pregnancy. Teen pregnancy rates are higher in students given abstinence-only education, {{as compared with}} comprehensive {{sex education}}. Some authorities recommend that those using abstinence as a primary method have backup method(s) available (such as condoms or emergency contraceptive pills). Deliberate non-penetrative sex without vaginal sex or deliberate oral sex without vaginal sex are also sometimes considered birth control. While this generally avoids pregnancy, pregnancy can still <b>occur</b> <b>with</b> intercrural sex {{and other forms of}} penis-near-vagina sex (genital rubbing, and the penis exiting from anal intercourse) where sperm can be deposited near the entrance to the vagina and can travel along the vagina's lubricating fluids.|$|E
5|$|Acne scars {{are caused}} by {{inflammation}} within the dermal layer of skin and are estimated to affect 95% of people with acne vulgaris. The scar is created by abnormal healing following this dermal inflammation. Scarring {{is most likely to}} take place with severe acne, but may <b>occur</b> <b>with</b> any form of acne vulgaris. Acne scars are classified based on whether the abnormal healing response following dermal inflammation leads to excess collagen deposition or loss {{at the site of the}} acne lesion.|$|E

5|$|All LDL {{receptor}} family proteins {{contain a}} cytoplasmic tail {{with at least}} one NPXY motif. This motif is important for binding intracellular adapter proteins and endocytosis. ApoER2 is distinct from most other members of the LDL family of receptors due to a unique insert on its cytoplasmic tail. In ApoER2, there is a proline-rich 59 amino acid insert encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 19. This insert allows for protein interactions that are unable to <b>occur</b> <b>with</b> other LDL receptors. It binds the PSD-95 adapter protein, cross-linking ApoER2 and the NMDA receptors during the process of long-term potentiation, and is also bound specifically by JIP-2, an important interaction in the JNK signalling pathway. It is also speculated that this insert may diminish the function of ApoER2 in lipoprotein endocytosis by somehow disrupting the NPXY motif.|$|E
5|$|An ongoing {{question}} is whether RAD should {{be thought of as}} a disorder of the child's personality or a distortion of the relationship between the child and a specific other person. It has been noted that as attachment disorders are by their very nature relational disorders, they do not fit comfortably into noslogies that characterize the disorder as centered on the person. Work by C.H. Zeanah indicates that atypical attachment-related behaviors may <b>occur</b> <b>with</b> one caregiver but not with another. This is similar to the situation reported for attachment styles, in which a particular parent's frightened expression has been considered as possibly responsible for disorganized/disoriented reunion behavior during the Strange Situation Procedure.|$|E
5|$|As many {{symptoms}} {{of carbon monoxide}} poisoning also <b>occur</b> <b>with</b> many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the diagnosis is often difficult. A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, such as being exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the amount of carboxyhemoglobin compared {{to the amount of}} hemoglobin in the blood.|$|E
