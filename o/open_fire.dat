5|$|As the French approached, the British lines {{held their}} fire. Wolfe had devised a firing method for {{stopping}} French column advances in 1755 {{that called for}} the centre—in this case, the 43rd and 47th Foot regiments—to hold fire {{while waiting for the}} advancing force to approach within , then <b>open</b> <b>fire</b> at close range.|$|E
5|$|Steaks {{are usually}} grilled, {{but they can}} be pan-fried, or broiled. Steak is often grilled in an attempt to {{replicate}} the flavor of steak cooked over the glowing coals of an <b>open</b> <b>fire.</b> Steak can also be cooked in sauce, such as in steak and kidney pie, or minced and formed into patties, such as hamburgers.|$|E
50|$|As {{the range}} closed, Bailey <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> on Nachi {{at a range}} of 14000 yd and then {{switched}} to a light cruiser. Coghlan <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> on Nachi at a range of 18000 yd.|$|R

25|$|While {{enclosed}} stoves {{are typically}} {{more efficient and}} controllable than <b>open</b> <b>fires,</b> there are exceptions. The type of water-heating 'back boiler' <b>open</b> <b>fires</b> commonly used in Ireland, for instance, can achieve more than 80% absolute efficiency.|$|R
5|$|The U.S. ship {{formation}} {{began to}} fall apart, apparently further delaying Callaghan's order to commence firing as he first tried to ascertain and align his ships' positions. Meanwhile, the two forces' formations began to overlap as individual ship commanders on both sides anxiously awaited permission to <b>open</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
5|$|The book is {{illustrated}} {{only with a}} frontispiece. In the 1610 edition this has six kitchen scenes, including a three-legged pot over an <b>open</b> <b>fire,</b> cordials being distilled, a bread oven, and pots and roasts on a spit over a fire.|$|E
5|$|Virginia headed {{directly}} for the Union squadron. The battle opened when Union tug Zouave fired on the advancing enemy, and Beaufort replied. This preliminary skirmishing had no effect. Virginia did not <b>open</b> <b>fire</b> {{until she was}} within easy range of Cumberland. Return fire from Cumberland and Congress bounced off the iron plates without penetrating, although later some of Cumberlands payload lightly damaged Virginia.|$|E
60|$|The Dervishes {{sprang from}} their hiding places, and lined the {{trenches}} behind the zareba. The troops halted, and waited. The Maxims moved {{in front of}} the British brigade, and then <b>opened</b> <b>fire.</b> A bugle sounded, and the whole line, black and white, advanced like a wall. When within three hundred yards, the men knelt down and <b>opened</b> <b>fire,</b> in volleys of sections. At the same instant the Dervishes, with difficulty restrained until now, <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> in return.|$|R
25|$|In October 2008, , the {{commander}} of the Russian peacekeeping battalion {{said in an interview with}} Izvestia that on the morning of 8 August the Russians <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> in response only after the Georgians had <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> on the observer post in the southern part of Tskhinvali.|$|R
25|$|The battle {{began with}} the Americans repulsing the British land attack on 14 September. Nicolls, ill at the time, was observing on Hermes. On 15 September, after {{contrary}} winds had died down, Percy crossed the bar with Hermes, Sophie, Carron, and Childers. The fort <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> at 3:20p.m. and at 3:30 Hermes <b>opened</b> <b>fire.</b> The U.S. fort and Hermes were at musket-shot range. At 3:40, Sophie <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> also, but the other two vessels {{were not able to}} get into a firing position. During the battle, a wooden splinter wounded Nicolls in the eye.|$|R
5|$|At 15:00 Lhermitte {{ordered the}} masts on Preneuse {{to be cut}} away and the frigate and battery then opened fire on Adamant, which was {{carefully}} sailing through the coastal shoals {{in an effort to}} engage the beached French ship. For more than two hours Hotham's ship worked its way inshore until at 17:30 it was well positioned to <b>open</b> <b>fire,</b> unleashing its broadside on the wrecked Preneuse. By 17:45 it was clear that further resistance was futile and Lhermitte struck his colours. Preneuse had surrendered, but was likely damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the smoke}} the commanders of the second line of Polish {{outposts}} {{could not see the}} approaching Russians and did not <b>open</b> <b>fire.</b> Contrary to the battle plan, the second line did not send reinforcements to the first. This was particularly important in the case of Forts 54 and 56, as they had to face the enemy alone, without the support of Forts 21, 22 and 23 behind them. The most important positions in the suburb of Wola received only token reinforcements from the main reserve and were forced to fight in isolation.|$|E
5|$|Ianto {{returns to}} the {{basement}} and is devastated to find Lisa dead. He then sees the delivery girl, who has a large cut across her forehead; Lisa implanted her brain into the delivery girl. At first reluctant, Ianto aims his gun at her, but cannot bring himself to shoot her. The girl tries to explain she did this for Ianto, but then promises {{that they can be}} upgraded together. The rest of the Torchwood team, arriving to hear that, <b>open</b> <b>fire</b> and kill her, leaving Ianto to mourn.|$|E

The type of water-heating 'back boiler' <b>open</b> <b>fires</b> commonly used in Ireland, for instance, can be more than 80% absolute efficiency, while the type of enclosed stove commonly used in China may be less than 20% efficient.|$|R
60|$|On {{the morning}} of the 31st of July, the Centurion, of 64 guns; and two armed transports, each with 14 guns, stood close in to one of the redoubts, and <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> upon it; while the English batteries, from the heights of the Montmorenci, <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> across the chasm upon the French lines.|$|R

5|$|Q-ships were {{merchant}} ships crewed by Navy {{personnel and}} bearing hidden weaponry. When attacked by U-boats, {{a portion of}} the ship's crew (referred to as a panic party) would appear to evacuate the vessel, sometimes setting smoke fires to simulate damage. This would encourage its attacker to approach and when the U-boat was close enough, the Q-ship's guns would become operational and <b>open</b> <b>fire,</b> hopefully destroying the submarine.|$|E
5|$|Rousseau {{had also}} been badly wounded in the exchange, and command of Junon passed to Lieutenant Jean-Léon Emeric, who {{attempted}} {{to pull away from}} his battered adversary. As he did so the small brig Driver was well placed to intervene, but her captain, Charles Claridge, failed to engage the larger frigate, even though Latona was now rapidly approaching from the west and together they could have outnumbered and outmanoeuvred Junon. Superieure was also close by, and her captain, William Ferrie, did approach the larger French ship, his fire causing enough damage to Junons sails to prevent her escape. Taking Horatio in tow at 14:24, the brig kept Scott's frigate in the chase until sufficient repairs were complete. By 14:40 Horatio was again sailing independently and Driver finally came close enough to <b>open</b> <b>fire,</b> although at extreme range: Claridge refused to sail any closer to Junon, despite urgent signals from Horatio and Superieure. At 15:04, Superieure was again close enough to the French ship to <b>open</b> <b>fire</b> and at 15:25 Latona arrived, her presence finally convincing Claridge to enter the action. Surrounded by enemy ships and his sails in tatters, Emeric made one last effort to escape to the north, the strain of this manoeuvre causing his main and mizen masts to collapse. With both flight and resistance impossible, Junon surrendered at 15:40.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the start}} of the 11th century, Welsh society started to build settlements. Food would be cooked in a single {{cauldron}} over an <b>open</b> <b>fire</b> on the floor, it would likely be reheated and topped up with fresh ingredients over a number of days. Some dishes could be cooked on a bakestone, a flat stone which could be placed above a fire to heat it evenly.|$|E

5|$|Well you can't believe it, but the Sturmovik, {{which was}} their main ground-attack aircraft, flew like B-17s in {{formation}} and didn't {{attempt to make}} any evasive manoeuvres. And all they had was one peashooter {{in the back of}} each plane. Also, some of the pilots were women. Their peashooter was no threat unless they had a very lucky hit on you. I didn't <b>open</b> <b>fire</b> til the aircraft filled my whole windscreen. If I did this, I would get one every time.|$|E
5|$|Wood has {{traditionally}} been used for fuel, especially in rural areas. In less developed nations {{it may be the}} only fuel available and collecting firewood is often a time consuming task as it becomes necessary to travel further and further afield in the search for fuel. It is often burned inefficiently on an <b>open</b> <b>fire.</b> In more developed countries other fuels are available and burning wood is a choice rather than a necessity. Modern wood-burning stoves are very fuel efficient and new products such as wood pellets are available to burn.|$|E
5|$|After {{eight months}} of bloody {{fighting}} {{it was decided to}} evacuate the entire force on the Gallipoli peninsula. Troop numbers were progressively reduced from 7 December and cunning ruses were performed to fool the Turks and to prevent them from discovering the Allies that were departing. At Anzac, the troops would maintain utter silence for an hour or more until the curious Turks would venture out to inspect the trenches, whereupon the Anzacs would <b>open</b> <b>fire.</b> As the numbers in the trenches were thinned, rifles were rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger. In what was ironically the best planned operation of the campaign, the evacuation was completed by dawn on 20 December 1915, without a single casualty.|$|E

A {{spokesman for the}} ATF stated that agents were dispatched to the scene to assist and to help trace the weapons used. The FBI also sent agents to assist. According to police, Steven Kazmierczak removed the hard drive from his laptop computer and a computer chip from his cell phone and did not leave a note that could help explain why he chose a geology class on Valentine's Day to <b>open</b> <b>fire.</b> Investigators were expected {{to spend at least}} three more weeks until releasing a report on the incident.|$|E
5|$|Although Bellone would {{normally}} be much faster than the large British warship, the light winds and Rattlesnakes determined pursuit prevented the privateer from escaping and at 17:00, Powerful {{was close enough to}} <b>open</b> <b>fire.</b> Despite the uneven nature of the combat, Bellone unexpectedly resisted the British attack for another hour and 45 minutes, causing more damage to Powerful than she received herself. The privateer was later taken into British service as a sixth rate frigate and prize money was paid for the captured vessels, but the action prompted questions in subsequent histories about the lack of efficiency in British gunnery.|$|E
5|$|At 14:00 on 8 February, {{four days}} after leaving the Îles des Saintes, Junon was spotted passing close to the Virgin Islands by the small British brigs HMS Superieure and , who signalled the {{approaching}} ship to halt and prepare for boarding. Ignoring the orders from the smaller ships, Rousseau continued northwards, passing through the Virgin Islands closely followed by Superieure, although Asp was unable to keep up and fell far behind during the night. At 08:00 {{on the morning of}} 9 February, with Virgin Gorda northwest, Superieure was close enough to <b>open</b> <b>fire,</b> a few long range shots failing to damage the large frigate, which responded with an ineffective broadside. The gunfire attracted other ships, and during the afternoon Superieure was joined by the British frigate HMS Latona, under Captain Hugh Pigot.|$|E
