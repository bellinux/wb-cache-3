5|$|During {{the period}} of Cromwell's rule and the {{subsequent}} Restoration, Smith manoeuvred to protect his position and to further his essentially Puritan religious stance, which he modified to suit the religious sensibilities of the new Royalist regime. He achieved this in part by creating an eponymous trust whereby some of his Irish property {{was used for the}} purpose of financing the education of children and provided scholarships for the most promising <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>to</b> continue their studies at Trinity College, Dublin. However, there have been claims that this trust was intended primarily to protect his interests in land, of which some was obtained by dubious interpretation of law.|$|E
5|$|However, {{in order}} to {{accomplish}} its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>to</b> whom it speaks. As Durkheim argues, this moral authority is primarily to be located in religion, which is why in any religion one finds a code of morality. For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the obligatory and the desirous aspects of morality.|$|E
5|$|Inscriptions for the {{practice}} of magic in Gaul show the characteristic use of Greek for spells in the Imperial period. A 2nd-century curse tablet from Autun (Augustodunum) lists the names <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>to</b> be cursed in Latin, two magic words in Greek, and a series of voces magicae. A defixio (binding spell) from Amélie-les-Bains seems composed in Celtic with bits of Latin. A lamella from Roman Britain has been interpreted as Hebrew written in Greek characters.|$|E

5|$|Princesses and princes of the United Kingdom are {{provided}} with distinctive forms of coronet, which they don during the service. A male heir-apparent's coronet displays four crosses-pattée alternating with four fleurs-de-lis, surmounted by an arch. The same style, without the arch, is used by other children and siblings of the monarch. The coronets of children of the heir-apparent display four fleurs-de-lis, two crosses-pattée and two strawberry leaves. A fourth style, including four crosses-pattée and four strawberry leaves, {{is used for the}} children of the sons and brothers of sovereigns.

5|$|A decree in April 1919 {{resulted}} {{in the establishment of}} concentration camps, which were entrusted to the Cheka, later administered by a new government agency, Gulag. By the end of 1920, 84 camps had been established across Soviet Russia, holding about 50,000 prisoners; by October 1923, this had grown to 315 camps and about 70,000 inmates. Those interned in the camps were used as slave labour. From July 1922, intellectuals deemed to be opposing the Bolshevik government were exiled to inhospitable regions or deported from Russia altogether; Lenin personally scrutinised the lists <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>to</b> be dealt with in this manner. In May 1922, Lenin issued a decree calling for the execution of anti-Bolshevik priests, causing between 14,000 and 20,000 deaths. The Russian Orthodox Church was worst affected; the government's anti-religious policies also impacted on Roman Catholic and Protestant churches, Jewish synagogues, and Islamic mosques.|$|E

25|$|The US {{opening of}} Battle of Anzio {{the next day}} {{immediately}} stripped Luftflotte 3 of 100 of their bombers, which were sent to Italy. Steinbock attacks continued through February with similarly bad results; {{by the end of}} the month the Mosquitoes had claimed 28 aircraft. Large attacks continued sporadically through March, including the night of 19/20 March when Joe Singleton and Geoff Haslam of No. 25 Sqn shot down three Ju 88's in a 13-minute span. Such events were not uncommon, and a number of crews racked up multi-kill missions. Smaller raids continued through the end of April with some harassment raids in May, by which point Luftflotte 3's force had fallen from 695 to just 133 operational aircraft. In comparison, RAF losses were about two dozen, with only one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>to</b> enemy action.|$|E
25|$|On {{the initial}} list <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>to</b> be arrested, which was {{drawn up by}} RUC Special Branch and MI5, there were 450 names, but only 350 of these were found.

The list included leaders of the non-violent Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association such as Ivan Barr and Michael Farrell. But, Tim Pat Coogan noted:What they did not include was a single Loyalist. Although the UVF had begun the killing and bombing, this organisation was left untouched, as were other violent Loyalist satellite organisations such as Tara, the Shankill Defence Association and the Ulster Protestant Volunteers. Faulkner was urged by the British to include a few Protestants in the trawl but, apart from two republicans, he refused.|$|E

25|$|Shortly afterwards, Botvinnik was {{urged to}} return to Moscow by the People's Commissar for Power Stations, an admirer and {{subsequent}} good friend. On his return, Botvinnik suggested a match with Samuel Reshevsky in order to strengthen his claim for a title match with Alekhine, but this received no political support. In December 1943, he won the Moscow Championship, ahead of Smyslov. At the same time, opposition to his plan for a match with Alekhine re-surfaced, {{on the grounds that}} Alekhine was a political enemy and the only proper course was to demand that he be stripped of the title. The dispute ended in Botvinnik's favor, and in the dismissal of a senior chess official, one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>to</b> have opposed Botvinnik's plan, who was also a KGB colonel.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prominent}} tosafist immediately after Rabbeinu Tam was his pupil and relative Isaac ben Samuel ha-Zaḳen (RI) of Dampierre, whose tosafot form {{a part of}} the Tosafot Yeshanim (see below). Isaac was succeeded by his pupil Samson ben Abraham of Sens (R"SH)(d. about 1235), who, besides enriching the literature with his own compositions, revised those of his predecessors, especially his teacher's, and compiled them into the group known as the Tosafot of Sens. Samson's fellow pupil Judah b. Isaac of Paris (Sir Leon) was also very active; he wrote tosafot to several Talmudic treatises, of which those to Berakot were published at Warsaw (1863); some <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>to</b> 'Abodah Zarah are extant in manuscript. Among the many French tosafists deserving special mention was Samuel ben Solomon of Falaise (Sir Morel), who, owing to the destruction of the Talmud in France in his time, relied for the text entirely upon his memory (Meïr of Rothenburg, Responsa, No. 250).|$|E
