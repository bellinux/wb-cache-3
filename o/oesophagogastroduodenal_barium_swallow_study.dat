The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the reliability of the <b>barium</b> <b>swallow</b> <b>study</b> in diagnosing anastomotic leaks following esophagectomy. Methods Patients who underwent esophagectomy from January 2000 to December 2013 at our institution were investigated. <b>Barium</b> <b>swallow</b> was routinely done between days 5 – 7 to detect a leak. These results were compared to clinically determined leaks (defined by neck wound infection requiring jejunal feeds and or parenteral nutrition) during the postoperative period. The sensitivity and specificity of <b>barium</b> <b>swallow</b> in diagnosing clinically significant anastomotic leaks was determined. Results A total of 395 esophagectomies were performed (mean age, 62. 2 years). The indications for the esophagectomy were as follows: malignancy (n= 320), high-grade dysplasia (n= 14), perforation (n= 27), benign stricture (n= 7), achalasia (n= 16), and other (n= 11). A variety of techniques were used including transhiatal (n= 351), McKeown (n= 35), and Ivor Lewis (n= 9) esophagectomies. Operative mortality was 2. 8 % (n= 11). Three hundred and sixty-eight patients (93 %) underwent <b>barium</b> <b>swallow</b> <b>study</b> after esophagectomy. Clinically significant anastomotic leak was identified in 36 patients (9. 8 %). <b>Barium</b> <b>swallow</b> was able to detect only 13 / 36 clinically significant leaks.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} routine use of <b>barium</b> <b>swallow</b> <b>study</b> in {{patients}} with chronic cough. METHODS: Between October of 2011 and March of 2012, 95 consecutive patients submitted to chest X-ray due to chronic cough (duration > 8 weeks) {{were included in the}} study. For study purposes, additional images were obtained immediately after the oral administration of 5 mL of a 5 % barium sulfate suspension. Two radiologists systematically evaluated all of the images in order to identify any pathological changes. Fisher's exact test and the chi-square test for categorical data were used in the comparisons. RESULTS: The images taken immediately after <b>barium</b> <b>swallow</b> revealed significant pathological conditions that were potentially related to chronic cough in 12 (12. 6 %) of the 95 patients. These conditions, which included diaphragmatic hiatal hernia, esophageal neoplasm, achalasia, esophageal diverticulum, and abnormal esophageal dilatation, were not detected on the images taken without contrast. After appropriate treatment, the symptoms disappeared in 11 (91. 6 %) of the patients, whereas the treatment was ineffective in 1 (8. 4 %).

40|$|Background. Intrathoracic periesophageal fundoplication {{carries a}} high risk of treacherous {{technical}} complications such as spontaneous gastric perforation. Methods. An intrathoracic fundoplication was performed on 84 patients suffering from gastroesophageal reflux disease with the junction between upper gastric folds and the unwrinkled esophageal mucosa remaining above the diaphragm while the esophageal body was quite straight on <b>barium</b> <b>swallow</b> <b>study.</b> Particular attention was paid to the following steps: further enlargement of the hiatal sling to avoid any strangulation of the stomach, very careful manipulation of gastric tissues with the fingers rather than with forceps, and meticulous anchoring of the wrap to the hiatus with numerous sutures while mimicking diaphragmatic movements that arise on cough. Results were assessed by personal interview (n = 84; median follow-up, 51. 5 months), <b>barium</b> <b>swallow</b> <b>study</b> (n = 84), 24 -hour esophageal pH monitoring (n = 65), and esophageal stationary manometry (n = 56). Results. No patient had any symptoms of reflux; 5 (5. 9 %) had episodes of dysphagia, which were frequent in 2; and 31 (37 %) had some degree of flatulence, which interfered with social life in 5. The mean percentage of total time that esophageal pH was below 4 at esophageal pH monitoring dropped significantly (p < 0. 001) from 12. 3 % before fundoplication to 0. 5 % after. Lower esophageal sphincter resting pressure increased significantly (p < 0. 0001) from 6. 9 mm Hg to 20. 6 mm Hg. Nine patients (10. 7 %) were reoperated on for spontaneous (n = 1) or anti-inflammatory drug-induced (n = 1) gastric perforation, further herniation of the stomach (n = 3), herniation of the colon (n = 3), or both (n = 1), into the chest. Conclusions. Intrathoracic periesophageal fundoplication for short esophagus is amazingly effective for treating reflux. Strict observance of some critical technical details makes spontaneous gastric perforation very unlikely. Any sudden increase in abdominal pressure at early follow-up is to be avoided, and anti-inflammatory drugs are strictly forbidden...|$|R
30|$|If {{pathology}} {{is detected}} during esophagography, CT imaging {{is often used}} to clarify findings and define anatomy; it can be particularly helpful in cases of suspected masses as barium esophagography cannot readily define disease extent outside the mucosa.

Importantly, CT imaging can be rapidly performed and is typically well tolerated by patients; this is especially important in patients who are unable to fully participate in a <b>barium</b> <b>swallow</b> <b>study</b> [4]. If oesophageal pathology is suspected, CT should be performed with both intravenous contrast (to assess for enhancing lesions) as well as oral contrast given just prior to imaging (to assist in the evaluation of the oesophageal lumen).

There are several different types of the diverticuli, and they are divided based on the anatomical location of origin relative to the cricopharyngeal muscle; these include Zenker’s, Killian-Jamieson’s, and Laimer’s diverticula. The authors present a unique case of pharyngoesophageal diverticulum {{that has not been}} previously described. Case Presentation. A 65 -year-old male presented with a 12 -month history of dysphagia and odynophagia for solids. <b>Barium</b> <b>swallow</b> revealed bilateral moderately sized diverticuli that altered in size during the different phases of swallow.

Methods: The charts of all patients diagnosed with laryngeal cleft in a tertiary care institution between 2009 and 2010 were evaluated retrospectively for age, gender, comorbidity, presenting features, and results of bedside swallow evaluation. Findings on flexible and direct laryngoscopy, both performed under general anes thesia, were compared. Results: Eleven patients had a diagnosis of laryngeal cleft, confirmed by direct laryngoscopy. Nine of eleven had signs of aspiration on modified <b>barium</b> <b>swallow</b> <b>study</b> (MBSS).

Objective: To report a patient with impending Allgrove′s syndrome and to highlight the importance of clinical suspicion in diagnosing the same. Materials and Methods: A 2. 5 -year-old girl was diagnosed with impending Allgrove′s syndrome {{on the basis of}} clinical presentation, <b>barium</b> <b>swallow</b> <b>study,</b> Schirmer′s test, and hormonal evaluation. Results: A 2. 5 -year-old girl, born of non-consanguineous marriage, presented with failure to thrive and developmental delay with occasional vomiting on taking solid or semi-solid food for past 6 months. Examination revealed stunted weight (SDS of - 4. 4) and height (SDS of - 4. 76), and <b>barium</b> <b>swallow</b> showed presence of achalasia. On direct questioning, her mother mentioned presence of decreased tears on crying since birth, and Schirmer′s test confirmed the presence of dry eyes. Baseline ACTH was slightly elevated with normal basal and post-ACTH stimulation serum cortisol. Based on these findings, impending Allgrove′s syndrome was diagnosed with a plan for follow-up study of adrenal function. Conclusions: Allgrove′s syndrome may be an under diagnosed disorder as aclarima is often overlooked. However, a high index of clinical suspicion may help in avoiding adrenal crisis by diagnosing the condition early...|$|R
