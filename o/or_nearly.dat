A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, around 9461billion kilometres, 5879billion miles, or 0.3066 parsecs. In round figures, a light year is nearly 10trillion kilometres <b>or</b> <b>nearly</b> 6trillion miles. Proxima Centauri, the closest star to Earth after the Sun, is around 4.2 light-years away.|$|E

5|$|Amanita rubrovolvata {{produces}} a white to cream-colored spore print. The spores are spherical <b>or</b> <b>nearly</b> so, and typically measure 7.5–9.0 by 7.0–8.5µm. They are inamyloid, {{meaning that they}} will not absorb iodine stain from Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are club-shaped, four-spored (rarely two-spored), and measure 25–44 by 10–14µm. The sterigmata (slender extensions at the basidial tips that attach to the spores) are 3–4µm long, and clamps are not found on the bases of basidia.|$|E
5|$|As of 2007, the brewing {{industry}} is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. As of 2006, more than 133 billion litres (35 billion gallons), {{the equivalent of a}} cube 510 metres on a side, of beer are sold per year, producing total global revenues of $294.5 billion (£147.7 billion). In 2010, China's beer consumption hit 450 million hectolitres (45 billion litres), <b>or</b> <b>nearly</b> twice that of the United States, but only 5 per cent sold were premium draught beers, compared with 50 per cent in France and Germany.|$|E
5|$|Both {{males and}} females have short, {{straight}} fur that is relatively dense and without spots or patterns. Both sexes are generally a reddish-brown dorsally and colored a dirty cream ventrally. When in rut, they may have an orange coloration to their abdomen from a reddish substance secreted by a chest gland secretions, but {{this has not been}} consistently observed by all researchers. The tail tends to be lighter in coloration than the sides. Juveniles are either gray <b>or</b> <b>nearly</b> white.|$|E

5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{considered}} to be an incurable and rapidly lethal cancer unless both the primary tumor and any metastases can be fully removed by surgery. No potentially curative treatment exists except surgery, but most people have advanced stage disease at presentation and are inoperable at the time of diagnosis. People with cholangiocarcinoma are generally managed - though not cured - with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and other palliative care measures. These are also used as additional therapies after surgery in cases where resection has apparently been successful (<b>or</b> <b>nearly</b> so).|$|E
5|$|Gasteroid {{fruit body}} types are either roughly spherical or tuberous, {{occasionally}} with stipes, and {{usually have a}} peridium that is either simple or multi-layered. Mature gasteroid fruit bodies generally open irregularly at maturity to expose a powdery gleba with a color ranging from white to yellow or black-brown to black. Capillitia are generally absent from the gleba. Spores are spherical <b>or</b> <b>nearly</b> so, and have a surface texture that ranges from smooth to wart-like and spiny, or sometimes with reticulations. Hyphae have clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{requires the}} presence of an identical <b>or</b> <b>nearly</b> identical sequence {{to be used as a}} template for repair of the break. The enzymatic machinery responsible for this repair process is nearly identical to the machinery responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis. This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister chromatid (available in G2 after DNA replication) or a homologous chromosome as a template. DSBs caused by the replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single-strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the replication fork and are typically repaired by recombination.|$|E

5|$|Many rivers {{originating}} in mountainous or high-latitude regions receive {{a significant portion}} of their flow from snowmelt. This often makes the river's flow highly seasonal resulting in periodic flooding during the spring months and at least in dry mountainous regions like the mountain West of the US or most of Iran and Afghanistan, very low flow {{for the rest of the}} year. In contrast, if much of the melt is from glaciated <b>or</b> <b>nearly</b> glaciated areas, the melt continues through the warm season, with peak flows occurring in mid to late summer.|$|E
5|$|On the Faroe Islands mainly Pilot Whales {{are killed}} by drive hunts for their meat and blubber. Other species are also killed on rare {{occasion}} such as the Northern bottlenose whale and Atlantic White-sided Dolphin. The Northern bottlenose whale is mainly killed when it accidentally swims {{too close to the}} beach and cannot return to the water. When the locals find them stranded <b>or</b> <b>nearly</b> stranded on the beach, they kill them and share the meat to all the villagers.|$|E
5|$|The Holliday {{junctions}} in {{homologous recombination}} are between identical <b>or</b> <b>nearly</b> identical sequences, {{leading to a}} symmetric arrangement of sequences around the central junction. This allows a branch migration process to occur where the strands move through the junction point. Cleavage, or resolution, of the Holliday junction can occur in two ways. Cleavage of the original set of strands leads to two molecules that may show gene conversion but not chromosomal crossover, while cleavage of the other set of two strands causes the resulting recombinant molecules to show crossover. All products, regardless of cleavage, are heteroduplexes {{in the region of}} Holliday junction migration.|$|E

5|$|The ascospores are smooth, elliptical, {{and measure}} 20–26 by 13–18µm. Asci (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical, eight-spored, hyaline (translucent) when mounted in dilute (2%) {{potassium}} hydroxide (KOH), and measure 225–330 by 15–25µm. Paraphyses are cylindrical to capitate or moniliform, measuring 95–250 long by 10–25µm wide, and are septate. Their tips are rounded to somewhat club-shaped or infrequently somewhat fuse-shaped. Elements on the sterile ridges are 50–175 by 12.5–20µm, and septate. The terminal cells are club-shaped <b>or</b> <b>nearly</b> so.|$|E
5|$|The spores are 7–9 by 7–9µm, spherical <b>or</b> <b>nearly</b> so, ornamented with {{a partial}} to {{complete}} reticulum (a system of raised, net-like ridges), with prominences up to 0.5µm high. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are both two- and four-spored, and measure 45–52 by 9–11µm. The cap cuticle is a poorly formed layer of inflated cells with scattered filamentous pileocystidia (cystidia on the cap). Somewhat {{unusual for a}} Lactarius, L.rufulus lacks or has few swollen cells (sphaerocysts) in the cap and stem.|$|E

5|$|Viewed in deposit, such {{as with a}} spore print, {{the spores}} of Marasmius rotula appear white or pale yellow. Under an optical microscope, they are hyaline (translucent), teardrop- or pip-shaped, and have {{dimensions}} of 7–10 by 3–5µm. The basidia (spore-producing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped <b>or</b> <b>nearly</b> so, and 21–21 by 4–17µm. Along {{the edge of the}} gill, interspersed among the basidia, are non-reproductive cells, the cheilocystidia; these are club-shaped with rough wart-like protuberances on the surface. The gill edges further feature broom cells, which are variably shaped, thin-walled, and measure 7–32 by 2.5–20µm. Their apical surfaces are covered with yellowish, blunt, and conical warts or incrustations 0.2–1.5 by 0.1–1µm.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{contemporaneous}} <b>or</b> <b>nearly</b> contemporaneous sources made {{mention of}} any further children, Charles may have fathered two daughters, according to historians Zsuzsa Teke and Gyula Kristó. Zsuzsa Teke writes {{that they were}} born to Mary of Bytom, but the nearly contemporaneous Peter of Zittau wrote that she had died childless. Gyula Kristó proposes that a miniature in the Illuminated Chronicle, which depicts Elisabeth of Poland and five children, implies that {{she gave birth to}} Charles's two daughters, because Kristó identifies two of the three children standing on her right as daughters. The elder of Charles's two possible daughters, Catherine, who was born in the early 1320s, was the wife of Henry II, Duke of Świdnica. Their only daughter, Anne, grew up in the Hungarian royal court after her parents' death, implying that Charles and Elisabeth of Poland were her grandparents. Historian Kazimierz Jasiński says that Elisabeth, the wife of BoleslausII of Troppau, was also Charles's daughter. If she was actually Charles's daughter, she must have been born in about 1330, according to Kristó.|$|E
