25|$|Urine may {{accumulate}} {{in the urine}} diversion section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> due to blockages in the urine pipe. Attention should be paid to urine pipe selection and layout and also the possible inclusion of plastic mesh {{at the mouth of}} the urine drain hole.|$|E
25|$|The {{prolapse}} may be obvious, or it {{may require}} straining and squatting to produce it. The anus is usually patulous, (loose, open) and has reduced resting and squeeze pressures. Sometimes {{it is necessary to}} observe the patient while they strain on a toilet to see the prolapse happen (the perineum can be seen with a mirror or by placing an endoscope in the bowl <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet).</b> A phosphate enema may need to be used to induce straining.|$|E
25|$|A basic {{pit latrine}} can be {{improved}} {{in a number of}} ways. One includes adding a ventilation pipe from the pit to above the structure. This improves airflow and decreases the smell <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet.</b> It also can reduce flies when the top of the pipe is covered with mesh (usually made out of fiberglass). In these types of toilets a lid need not be used to cover the hole in the floor. Other possible improvements include a floor constructed so fluid drains into the hole and a reinforcement of {{the upper part of the}} pit with bricks, blocks, or cement rings to improve stability.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a decline in <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> public <b>toilets</b> and, with over 50 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public <b>toilets</b> being closed, this has become a cause for public concern. Local {{authorities}} have no legal requirement to provide public toilets and because of this some towns have no public <b>toilet</b> provision. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study was to investigate}} the adequacy and provision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public <b>toilets</b> on <b>the</b> Island <b>of</b> Guernsey. This investigation was undertaken through observation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 30 public <b>toilet</b> blocks and a questionnaire exploring <b>the</b> provision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public <b>toilets,</b> emailed to a representative sample <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Island population. All 18 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilets</b> for those with disabilities, 26 (out <b>of</b> 30) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male and 27 (out <b>of</b> 30) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> female public <b>toilets</b> were observed and the response rate to the questionnaire was 48 % (n= 264). Results confirmed that there are an adequate number of public <b>toilet</b> facilities for <b>the</b> Island’s population in accordance with the British Standards. Fifty-five per cent of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> facilities. However concerns were expressed about <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public <b>toilet</b> that were closed during the winter months and <b>the</b> proposed closure <b>of</b> <b>toilets</b> in an effort to save money. The research concluded that the adequacy, provision and impression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public <b>toilets</b> on Guernsey was good, but more attention needs to be given to year-round availability and the additional facilities required within them...|$|R
25|$|For wiping of the anal area after defecation—or for wiping after urination—UDDT {{users can}} avail {{themselves}} of the same materials that are utilized while using other types of toilets. Suitable biodegradable materials available in the surroundings can also be used, such as toilet paper, leaves, corn cobs or sticks. These materials are deposited along with feces in the feces portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> so that everything can eventually decompose together. For example, in Ecuador the soft, perfumed leaves of Piper auritum, Piperaceae and Melastomataceae are being used. Users have also used stones, although this makes the vault fill up very fast and is therefore not practical for UDDTs.|$|E
25|$|By the 1960s, Riis Park {{was in a}} {{state of}} disrepair, which {{included}} debris on the beach, and lack of maintenance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> and bathhouse facilities. The park was damaged by the Ash Wednesday Storm in March 1962. Further renovations occurred during this time. In May 1962, an 18-year-old was fatally stabbed at the beach. On June 13, 1964, the bust of Jacob Riis at the Central Mall was stolen. In August 1965, eighty people swimming at Riis Park and Rockaway Beach were treated for stings from Portuguese man o' war hydrozoans, a taxonomic class similar to jellyfish. In addition to vandalism, there were also increasing arrests for drug-related offenses on the beach.|$|E
25|$|In {{cases where}} no reuse is {{possible}} or desired, urine is usually infiltrated {{in the soil}} unless this practice would cause groundwater pollution. In eThekwini municipality in South Africa or in Lima, Peru, for example, urine from UDDTs is safely infiltrated into the soil because the groundwater level is very low there and the groundwater is not used for any particular purpose. Infiltration {{can be done by}} directing the urine to a soak pit or by running a perforated urine pipe from the toilet to an area outside, where the hose is sloping gently downhill (for rural areas). Clogging of the pipe's holes can be avoided by ensuring there are no T-junctions, no joints and that a plastic mesh is installed in the urine funnel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> to keep everything other than urine out.|$|E

25|$|Mobile UDDTs are {{typically}} either fabricated of new materials {{in a factory}} or workshop using a mix of proprietary and off-the-shelf parts—and then sold to the public either directly or via distributors or retail outlets; or fabricated at home out of wood, using new and re-purposed parts and materials. They {{are typically}} compact and lightweight, allowing one person to easily lift, transport, and maneuver them into place. Likewise, installation is a relatively simple process given that everything needed for the proper functioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet,</b> except a source of electrical power for those models that include a fan and some allowance for exterior ventilation, is contained within the molded or wooden carcass. One advantage {{of this type of}} UDDT is that they are portable, making them an interesting option for remote or temporary installations and for installations aboard moving vehicles or non-stationary residences such as boats, recreational-vehicles (i.e. caravan, camper van, motor home) and tiny-houses.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons for low sales outside Japan. One main reason is that it takes some time for the {{customers}} {{to get used to the}} idea of a washlet. Sales in Japan were also slow when the device was introduced in 1980, but after some acclimatization, sales improved significantly starting in 1985. Around 1990, 10% of Japanese households had a washlet, and this number increased greatly to over 50% in 2002. Toto expects a corresponding improvement in foreign sales within the next few years. Another reason is the lack of a power supply near the toilet. While virtually all Japanese washrooms have an electric outlet behind the toilet, many foreign bathrooms do not have a nearby outlet. In Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the UK, and many other countries, high current electrical outlets installed in close proximity to water, or where persons may be wet, are prohibited by legally enforced codes due to health and safety reasons. Finally the outlet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> (for S-type toilets) is max. 10 ~ 15cm from back wall but Japanese toilets need it to be at least 30cm so a S-type European toilet cannot be replaced easily with a Japanese toilet. They are also much more expensive than traditional Western toilets. Finally, in Europe, there is the competition of the traditional Western bidet; conversely, North Americans are not accustomed to any sort of bidet.|$|E
25|$|From {{the ground}} level {{entrance}} {{door on the}} western side of the tower, a spiral concrete staircase with steel tubular handrail winds around a central service duct before arriving in the near-centre of the observation room. Apart from an enclosed toilet in the north-west corner, the observation room is an open space with a central pillar that contains cavities for services that link to the roof level. Fixed angled glazing wraps around the north, east and south sides. A set of recent laminated cabinetry sits below the observation windows along the north-east. Original metal window frames on the western wall are a mixture of mid-point pivoting and fixed panes, while more recent aluminium-framed windows are found in the toilet. Floors are lined with linoleum and a system of suspended ceiling panels conceals the underside of the concrete roof slab. A recent sink and cupboard sits up against the southern wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet.</b> All original communications equipment has been removed. Access to the external balcony, which wraps around all sides except the straight, western edge, is through a single door in the south-west corner. This timber door retains the original separate screen door. The narrow balcony has a concrete floor and a balustrade made from two tubular steel rails and widely separated balusters covered in asbestos cement sheeting rendered with pebble-dash on the exterior face. The steel balusters pierce the concrete floor slab and are fixed on the underside.|$|E

500|$|The worst {{cells for}} {{confinement}} as a punishment for inmates who {{stepped out of}} line were located {{at the end of}} D-Block in cells 9–14, known as [...] "The Hole". The cells were devoid of light and colder {{than the rest of the}} prison, and prisoners sent here were regularly stripped, beaten, and tortured and often starved, forced to sleep on the cold concrete floor wearing nothing but light underwear. In turn, guards were abused, and often had faeces, urine or food thrown at them or were spat at. Inmates held in the hole were limited to just one 10-minute shower and an hour of exercise in the yard a week. The five cells of [...] "The Hole" [...] had nothing but a sink and toilet and the very worst cell was nicknamed [...] "The Oriental" [...] or [...] "Strip Cell", the final cell of the block with nothing but a hole in the floor as a toilet, in which prisoners would often be confined naked with nothing else for two days. The guards controlled the flushing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> in that cell. A hatchway in the floor on D-Block also led to the dungeon in the basement which contained several cells. The worst behaved inmates would be locked inside their cells in the dungeon, chained to the walls. They were given a meager diet of bread and water each day, and one regular meal every three days, although the quantity and duration often varied relative to the extent of the punishment. Denied of proper toilet facilities, they were given a bucket as a toilet, emptied once a week, and stripped and chained to the wall standing at nights; according to Alvin J. Esau, prisoners in solitary confinement were [...] "placed on a starvation diet and made to stand nine hours each day with hands tied and their feet barely touching the floor." [...] After completing the punishment in the hole, the prisoner could then return to his cell but be tagged; a red tag, third grade, denoted a prisoner who was restricted from leaving his cell for perhaps 3 months. At second grade the prisoners could receive letters, and if after 30 days they remained behaved, they would then be restored full prison privileges.|$|E

2500|$|Urine {{diversion}} {{takes advantage}} of the anatomy of the human body, which excretes urine and feces separately. In a UDDT, the urine is kept separate and drained via a basin with a small hole near the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> bowl or squatting pan, while feces fall through a larger drop-hole at the rear. This separate collection– or [...] "source separation"– does not require the user to change positions between urinating and defecating, although some care is needed to ensure the right position over the user interface.
