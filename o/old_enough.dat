5|$|Eleven of the Shunzhi Emperor's 32 spouses bore him a {{total of}} {{fourteen}} children, but only four sons (Fuquan, Xuanye, Changning, and Longxi) and one daughter (Princess Gongyi Chang) lived to be <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to marry. Unlike later Qing emperors, {{the names of the}} Shunzhi Emperor's sons did not include a generational character.|$|E
5|$|Youthfulness : Horace emphasises Troilus' youth {{by calling}} him inpubes ("unhairy", i.e. pre-pubescent or, figuratively, not <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to bear arms). Dio Chrysostom derides Achilles in his Trojan discourse, {{complaining}} {{that all that}} the supposed hero achieved before Homer was the capture of Troilus who was still a boy.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} his schooling in Punjab {{and at the}} Sherwood College, Nainital, he achieved a distinction in the School Certificate of the Cambridge Board, an English language curriculum developed by the University of Cambridge International Examinations, {{at the age of}} 15. He asked his father to send him to London to become a gynaecologist. But his father refused, stating that he was not <b>old</b> <b>enough.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{he had not}} {{sought the}} office and was not <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to serve, Breckinridge was elected to {{represent}} Botetourt County in the Virginia House of Delegates in late 1780. Legend says he was twice refused his seat because of his age, but his constituents reelected him each time, and he was seated the third time, but official records do not support this. His legislative colleagues included Patrick Henry, Benjamin Harrison, John Tyler, John Taylor of Caroline, George Nicholas, Daniel Boone, and Benjamin Logan.|$|E
5|$|Martin Brodeur {{was born}} on May 6, 1972, in Montreal. He was one of five {{children}} of Denis and Mireille Brodeur. Denis played in the 1956 Olympics for Team Canada and won a bronze medal. After his playing career, Denis was a longtime photographer for the Montreal Canadiens. For more than 20 years, he attended all Montreal games and practices, and when Martin was <b>old</b> <b>enough,</b> he came along. Brodeur idolized Canadiens goaltender Patrick Roy.|$|E

5000|$|One {{theory is}} that the Portuguese name for F. citrifolia, [...] "Os Barbados", gave Barbados its name. It appears on the coat of arms of Barbados, and the removal of one specimen, over 100 years <b>old,</b> was <b>enough</b> to draw attention.|$|R
5|$|Scully {{was born}} October 2, 1956 at Springfield Hospital in Springfield, Massachusetts {{and grew up}} in the Merrick section of West Springfield.

Scully is of Irish ancestry.|$|E
5|$|The {{raising of}} school leaving age (shortened to ROSLA) {{is the name}} given by the {{government}} to refer to changes regarding the legal age a child is permitted to leave compulsory education as specified under an Education Act. In most countries, the school leaving age often reflects when young people are seen to be mature enough within their society, but not necessarily when they are <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to be regarded as an adult.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{cycle of}} the fisher lasts almost a year. Female fishers {{give birth to a}} litter of three or four kits in the spring. They nurse and care for their kits until late summer, when they are <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to set out on their own. Females enter estrus shortly after giving birth and leave the den to find a mate. Implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until the following spring, when they give birth and the cycle is renewed.|$|E

Bart tries to avoid {{detection}} and trouble, but is spotted by Brodka, who shows a disbelieving Marge and Homer the security tape of Bart shoplifting. Disappointed by Bart's actions and concerned that she may be mothering him too much, Marge decides that he is <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> {{to make his own}} decisions and becomes distant with him. Fearing he has lost Marge's love, Bart decides he must regain it.|$|E
5|$|Although the Chronicle of Man {{maintains}} that Lǫgmaðr voluntarily vacated his throne, {{there is reason}} to suspect that he was forced from power. In about 1096, the chronicle claims that the leading Islesmen sought assistance of Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster (died 1119), and petitioned him to provide a regent from his own kin to govern the kingdom until Lǫgmaðr's younger brother, Óláfr (died 1153), was <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to assume control. The chronicle's account could be evidence that, by about 1096, Lǫgmaðr faced a faction formed around his younger brother; and that, when this faction was unable to topple Lǫgmaðr by itself, it approached Ua Briain for assistance in placing Óláfr upon the throne.|$|E
5|$|An {{accomplished}} woman, Finch gained {{her appointment}} as royal governess in August 1762 upon {{the birth of}} George, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of King George and Queen Charlotte. Finch's duties included oversight of the royal nursery and all the staff employed therein, as well as organising lessons for the children. Finch oversaw the princes' education until they became <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to live in their own households under the watch of governors, while the six princesses remained under her supervision until they turned 21. Finch retired from her role in 1793, though she continued to correspond {{with members of the}} royal family and receive gifts from them.|$|E

5|$|Antibody {{tests in}} {{children}} younger than 18months are typically inaccurate due to the continued presence of maternal antibodies. Thus HIV infection can only be diagnosed by PCR testing for HIV RNA or DNA, or via testing for the p24 antigen. Much of the world lacks access to reliable PCR testing and many places simply wait until either symptoms develop or the child is <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> for accurate antibody testing. In sub-Saharan Africa as of 2007–2009 between 30 and 70% of the population were aware of their HIV status. In 2009, between 3.6 and 42% {{of men and women}} in Sub-Saharan countries were tested which represented a significant increase compared to previous years.|$|E
5|$|Cassie is the {{daughter}} of Nathan and Elena and Samuel's niece. She was named after Cassandra Morgan, Nathan and Samuel's deceased mother. She is voiced and motion captured by Kaitlyn Dever. She is playable in the epilogue chapter of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. While wandering around the house looking for her parents, she stumbles across the keys to Nathan's private wardrobe, where she discovers her parents' shady past before she is caught by Nathan and Elena. Cassie demands to know the truth, and Nathan and Elena decide she is <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to know.|$|E
5|$|Denning {{was told}} he would be ineligible {{to serve in the}} Armed Forces because of a {{systolic}} heart murmur, which he believed the doctor diagnosed because he was tired of sending young men off to die. He successfully appealed against the decision, and enlisted on 14 August 1917 as a cadet in the Hampshire Regiment before being sent to the Royal Engineers Oxford University Officer Training Corps. He trained at Newark and was temporarily commissioned as a second lieutenant on 17 November 1917. Although he was <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to serve in the armed forces, regulations meant that he was not allowed to serve in France until he was nineteen.|$|E
50|$|A giant ox {{as tall as}} {{the clouds}} is brought from Karelia to Pohja {{intended}} for the great wedding feast, {{but no one can}} be found to slaughter it. One day an <b>old</b> man—small <b>enough</b> to fit under a wooden bowl—rose from the sea and slaughtered the animal.|$|R

5|$|Epaminondas evidently began {{serving as}} a soldier after adolescence; Plutarch refers to an {{incident}} involving Epaminondas that occurred during a battle at Mantinea. Though not explicitly stated, this was probably the Spartan attack on Mantinea in 385 BC, as described by Xenophon; Plutarch tells us that Epaminondas was there {{as part of a}} Theban force aiding the Spartans, so this battle fits the description.* Hanson, Hoplites, 146; Stylianoy, Diodorus Siculus, 172. However, Buck (Boiotia, 63) questions the existence of a SpartanTheban alliance in 385 BC. Epaminondas was certainly not <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to have served at the First Battle of Mantinea which was in 418 BC.|$|E
5|$|For the sequel, Final Fantasy X-2, {{producer}} Kitase {{thought that}} the greatest fan expectation was for the reunion of Tidus and Yuna after their separation in the first game. The game generated rumors about Tidus' connection with the villain, Shuyin, who was physically similar and had the same actors. Square responded that such a storyline, given Tidus' nature, would be too complicated. For the remastering of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2, producer Kitase's motivation was to have people {{too young to have}} played the games experience them; his son was only <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to know the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel.|$|E
5|$|Keene came to Alaska for {{the first}} time in the early 1970s to attend a cousin's wedding. Attracted by the state's beauty, she {{returned}} for several visits before making the decision in 1977 to move there — alone. Her son Lonnie was deemed <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to make his own decisions, and he chose to remain in Minnesota. Keene took a week to drive from Minnesota to Alaska in a secondhand motorhome, ending in Homer, where she parked the motorhome at the end of Homer Spit in the Homer Spit Campground, where it remained for many years. She took a job at a fish processing facility on the Spit, the Icicle Seafoods subsidiary Seward Fisheries, in the spring of 1977, where she later became a foreman.|$|E
50|$|The 1919 Oxford (advertised {{as early}} as September 1918) was {{assembled}} from locally made components and now took on the rather more substantial aspect of 1915s Cowley.
