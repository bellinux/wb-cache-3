40|$|Home' {{is not an}} easy {{concept to}} pin down. Although the term is {{instantly}} familiar, and the physical reality <b>of</b> <b>home</b> is an important and omnipresent feature of our everyday lives, the legal conception <b>of</b> <b>home</b> has received surprisingly little attention. The relative neglect <b>of</b> <b>home</b> is particularly striking, however, in light of the substantial body of research which has been carried out on the subject <b>of</b> <b>home</b> in other disciplines.

It is suggested that a legal concept of the meaning <b>of</b> <b>home</b> would be useful, for instance, when considering the conflict of interests between the occupiers of a property 'as a home', and other parties with 'non?home' interests in the property, for example, creditors. This article seeks to identify some of the values <b>of</b> <b>home</b> which might inform a legal concept <b>of</b> <b>home,</b> and so be 'weighed in the balance' on the occupier's side when decisions involving conflicts between home interests and commercial interests are considered...|$|R

I focus on the youngster’s transition from out <b>of</b> <b>home</b> care into independent life in the third chapter. In this context the part of the educators in transitioning the youngsters into independent life is also presented. In addition, different varieties of help after discharge from out <b>of</b> <b>home</b> care are introduced in form of youth residential centres and apartment groups. Qualitative methodology is used in the empirical part of the master’s thesis. Transition from out <b>of</b> <b>home</b> care into independent life analysis was made based on the interviews with three youngsters and three educators from out <b>of</b> <b>home</b> care in Slovenia. The results of the research show that the transition into independent life of the youngsters happens through the whole life in an out <b>of</b> <b>home</b> care.
