50|$|Generally, the Lead Pilot Car Operator {{functions}} {{to maintain an}} assured clear distance - 1/2 to 1 mi - ahead of the Load. The Lead Pilot Car Operator frequently transmits his lane position, road name, lack of <b>overhead</b> <b>obstruction</b> {{up to and including}} a landmark or building and direction of travel. The Lead Pilot Car Operator is expected to observe any obstruction or complication that may require the Load to alter its path and transmit clear instructions to the Load and other necessary vehicles. Hearing the transmission from the Lead Pilot car, the Rear Pilot Car Operator ensures that the desired lane is clear and moves the Rear Pilot Car to operate in the now-clear lane. The Rear Pilot Car Operator transmit the clear lane availability to the Load. After passing the obstruction, the Lead Pilot car Operator informs the Load that the Lead Pilot car is now operating in a specific lane as it passes a specific landmark or building. The Rear Pilot Car Operator ensures and transmits that the desired lane is currently clear and moves the Rear Pilot Car to operate in the now-clear lane.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{interest}} for land navigation has increased {{for the recent}} years. With {{the advent of the}} Global Position System (GPS) we have now the ability to determine the absolute position anywhere on the globe. The problem is that the GPS systems work well only in open environments with no <b>overhead</b> <b>obstructions</b> and they are subject to large unavoidable errors when the reception from some of the satellites is blocked. This occurs frequently in urban environments, forests and tunnels. GPS systems require at least four “visible” satellites to maintain a good position fix. In many situations in which higher level of accuracy is required, the navigation cannot be achieved by GPS alone.

50|$|The {{certified}} Pilot Car Operator protects people, {{vehicles and}} property by several actions. The simple {{presence of a}} Pilot Car warns other drivers and pedestrians. The Lead (front position) Pilot Car often has a calibrated High Pole (and depending upon the state, a durable, fade-resistant yellow sign) bolted to its front bumper. The High Pole is designed to collide with overpasses, power lines and tree branches that may be above the lane in which the Pilot Car and the Load are operating. The Lead Pilot Car Operator transmits radio messages to the Load and other necessary vehicles of <b>overhead</b> <b>obstructions</b> or road conditions that require the Load to alter its path or stop. Finally, a Pilot Car Operator may park the Pilot Car just off the roadway and direct traffic with a reversible Slow/Stop sign or orange flags while wearing a bright vest and hard hat.|$|R
500|$|The size of {{the reserve}} depends upon the risks {{involved}} during the dive. A deep or decompression dive warrants a greater reserve than a shallow or a no stop dive. In recreational diving for example, {{it is recommended that}} the diver plans to surface with a reserve remaining in the cylinder of 500psi, 50 bar or 25% of the initial capacity, depending of the teaching of the diver training organisation. This is because recreational divers practicing within [...] "no-decompression" [...] limits can normally make a direct ascent in an emergency. On technical dives where a direct ascent is either impossible (due to <b>overhead</b> <b>obstructions)</b> or dangerous (due to the requirement to make decompression stops), divers plan larger margins of safety.

Part of this project includes an evaluation of a Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) for vehicle-based lane sensing. This report documents the results of tests of the 5 Hz NovAtel RT 20 DGPS receiver. A series of 32 static tests found the overall {{mean and standard deviation}} for the offset errors within specifications. In a series of dynamic tests, in which the vehicle was driven around the track at speeds of 20 - 35 miles per hour, after removing the effect of the GPS receiver's latency, the DGPS determined position exhibited a mean offset error of- 17. 3 cm (- 6. 82 in) and a mean standard deviation of 25. 5 cm (10. 1 in) in the direction of vehicle motion. In the direction perpendicular to vehicle motion, the mean offset was 4. 57 cm (1. 8 in) with a mean standard deviation of 39. 6 cm (15. 6 in).

Several online post-processing services compute high-accuracy geodetic coordinates from static global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data collected on a single mark.

Afterwards, the effects of including data at faster logging rates and adding observables from Russia’s GNSS (i. e., GLONASS) were investigated by processing the same data files with both GPS and GLONASS observables enabled at logging rates of 30, 15, and 10 seconds in TrimbleRTX. The resulting coordinates from the post-processing were differenced with coordinates derived at each mark from a campaign-style static GNSS survey. Increasing the logging rates did not significantly reduce the root-mean-square error (RMS) of the differences; however, adding GLONASS observables reduced the RMS, for session durations no more than 4 hours, by approximately 29...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1955 A {{regional}} {{analysis of}} the street tree problem has been undertaken in order to evolve a system of tree classification which {{would be useful to}} city planners, arborists, and landscape architects who have the responsibility of selecting trees to fulfill their design requirements for the city street. Three lines of approach to the problem were followed: ecological considerations, an {{analysis of the}} controlled conditions of the city environment, and a classification of the various tree characteristics which might affect their selection. The most significant factors of environment in relation to the selection and use of trees are climate and soil. Of these, separate classifications have been made under the major headings of soil, water, temperature, light and atmosphere. An analysis of the apparent reactions of the various trees to these factors in the Pacific Northwest has been undertaken and suitable trees, from the list of 245 species and varieties, considered as possibilities for street use, have been placed in the classification. The controlled conditions of the city environment have been considered under the headings: types of streets, street widths, building setbacks, planting strips, <b>overhead</b> <b>obstructions,</b> underground services, and building heights. Trees have been selected to suit these city factors and classified under the above headings. The morphological and other characteristics of trees which might affect their selection for street use are: shape, size, root systems, rate of growth, longevity, resistance or susceptibility to diseases and pests, tolerance of city conditions and extremes of environment, flowering and fruiting habits, specific effects (especially seasonal effects), mass and texture. Trees have been selected to suit. a classification based on these characteristics. The punched card system of classification has been used to assemble the results of the three lines of approach to the problem, the code having been prepared from the above factors...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{prestressed}} concrete I-girder bridges {{built in the}} past several decades have demonstrated the ability of precast, prestressed spliced girder bridges to compete with structural steel plate girder bridges in the 120 ft– 300 ft span range. Some states limit the maximum transportable length of a member to 120 ft and the weight to 70 tons. Others, including Nebraska, have permitted lengths up to 175 ft and weights up to 100 tons. ^ When span lengths exceed the maximum shippable length or weight, however, girder segments must be spliced at intermediate locations in the girder away from the piers. ^ There are several other ways to extend the span capacity limits of standard products. These include using high strength concrete, establishing moment continuity for superimposed deck and live loading, and utilizing pier geometry to allow longer spans. Each of these methods is discussed and examples are provided. ^ This dissertation discusses the design and construction of spliced-girder bridges. Design theory, post-tensioning analysis and details, segment-to-segment joint details and examples of recently constructed spliced-girder bridges are given. ^ In recent years the trend towards increased span capacity of girder bridges has continued due to the need for improved safety and fast bridge replacement. Precast concrete members must now span further while minimizing the superstructure depth in order to compete favorably with a new breed of high performance structural steel I-beams. This dissertation presents four systems for creating continuous spliced concrete I-girders. ^ For continuous large span precast prestressed concrete spliced I-girder bridges, the optimum solution is often a haunched girder system. Because of the need to use standard sizes as repetitively as possible and to clear <b>overhead</b> <b>obstructions</b> during shipping, a separate precast haunch block attached to the girder bottom flange is used to form a deeper section for the negative moment zone. ^ This dissertation summarizes an extensive theoretical and experimental research into the feasibility of splicing a haunch block onto a standard I-girder to form an efficient negative moment zone. ...|$|R
40|$|Development of an {{evaluation}} criterion to assess pedestrian facilities in urban environment using walkability measures Utility-related walking includes household, transportation, or occupation purpose walking {{and that has}} now become a solution in sustainable transport systems. Presence of facilities for pedestrians is at vital importance in both utility-related walking and recreational walking. Walkability is an idea of quantifying the safety and desirability of walking routes. It is defined in many ways under different disciplines. The most commonly used definition is: {{the extent to which the}} built environment is friendly to the presence of people living, shopping, visiting, enjoying or spending time in an area. This research discusses the major pedestrian facilities involved in utility-related walking and proposes a scoring model to evaluate the pedestrian facilities in urban environment using ―walkability‖ measures. The proposed model can be used to evaluate pedestrian facilities in road links to compare different road links and to identify deficiencies in a given road. At present walkability is evaluated using qualitative measures that are very subjective. Existing methods of evaluating walkability were carefully studied and the limitations and weaknesses were identified. In the proposed model, a score as a percentage is finally obtained from the evaluation where 100 % means a perfect road to walk and 0 means the worst condition for walking. This could be used in detail to compare two or more roads. The facilities evaluated in the proposed model are: sidewalks, crosswalks, pedestrian amenities and aesthetics, disability infrastructure, and security from crimes. Methods to evaluate as many features of pedestrian facilities were proposed and validated. The features of sidewalks are: presence & continuity of raised sidewalks, obstructions, effective width of sidewalks, modal conflict, surface condition of sidewalks, and Albedo of the paving material. The features of crosswalks are: availability of crosswalks, and delay at signalized crossings and un-signalized crossings. Availability of pedestrian facilities including, benches, shades, bus halts with seats, pedestrian information boards, proper street lighting add scores to a road link. Aesthetics is assessed as a qualitative factor. Tactile paving, uniformity of the paved sidewalks, cross slopes, curb ramps, drainage, and <b>overhead</b> <b>obstructions</b> are the features under infrastructure for the disabled people...|$|R
