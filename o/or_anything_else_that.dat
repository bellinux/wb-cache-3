It was text only, as Raskin disliked the computer mouse <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>that</b> could take his hands from the keyboard. A number of basic applications were built into the machine, selectable by pressing function keys. The machine also included logic that would understand user intentions and switch programs dynamically. For instance, if the user simply started typing text it would switch into editor mode, and if they typed numbers it would switch to calculator mode. In many cases these switches would be largely invisible to the user.|$|E

The trio are enjoying their unusual living arrangement, but world events are beginning to affect their existence. It is {{the height of the}} Spanish Civil War, and idealistic Guy, a long-time supporter of the army of the Second Spanish Republic, is determined to do what he can to help them as Francisco Franco's fascists gain strength. Mia, too, is anxious to {{come to the aid of}} her native land. Gilda, however, has no interest in politics <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>that</b> might disrupt her life of luxury, and pleads with the two to ignore the conflict, but they feel compelled to act and depart for Spain.|$|E

[...] Herriman experimented with a {{decision}} about the character's gender, but it remained ambiguous and he would refer to [...] "Kat" [...] as [...] "he" [...] or [...] "she" [...] as he saw fit. Herriman incorporated unusual details into the mini-strip's backgrounds—cacti, pagodas, fanciful vegetation, <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>that</b> struck his fancy; this became a signature of the later Krazy Kat strip. [...] The cast grew and soon included the mainstay character Bull Pupp and characters from the Gooseberry Sprigg strip. [...] The strip's characters, relations and situations grew organically during its lifetime, encouraged by Herriman's colleagues.|$|E

2500|$|In 1916, Weber {{explained}} her {{philosophy of}} directing films: [...] "I'll never {{be convinced that}} the general public does not want serious entertainment rather than frivolous", and [...] "A real director should be absolute.

2500|$|His {{argument}} is that, {{just as an}} astrologer must consider cultural differences [...] "lest he mistake the appropriate customs and manners by assigning, for example, marriage with a sister to one who is Italian by race, instead of to the Egyptian as he should", {{it is necessary to}} consider the age in life that important astrological events occur.

2500|$|At this time, Galileo also {{engaged in}} a dispute over the reasons that objects float or sink in water, siding with Archimedes against Aristotle. The debate was unfriendly, and Galileo's blunt and {{sometimes}} sarcastic style, though not extraordinary in academic debates of the time, made him enemies. [...] During this controversy one of Galileo's friends, the painter Lodovico Cardi da Cigoli, informed him that a group of malicious opponents, which Cigoli subsequently referred to derisively as [...] "the Pigeon league," [...] was plotting to cause him trouble over the motion of the earth, <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>that</b> would serve the purpose. According to Cigoli, one of the plotters asked a priest to denounce Galileo's views from the pulpit, but the latter refused.

2500|$|Opportunity cost {{refers to}} the {{economic}} cost of production: {{the value of the}} next best opportunity foregone. Choices must be made between desirable yet mutually exclusive actions. It has been described as expressing [...] "the basic relationship between scarcity and choice". For example, if a baker uses a sack of flour to make pretzels one morning, then the baker cannot use either the flour or the morning to make bagels instead. [...] Part of the cost of making pretzels is that neither the flour nor the morning are available any longer, for use in some other way. [...] The opportunity cost of an activity is an element in ensuring that scarce resources are used efficiently, such that the cost is weighed against the value of that activity in deciding on more or less of it. Opportunity costs are not restricted to monetary or financial costs but could be measured by the real cost of output forgone, leisure, <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>that</b> provides the alternative benefit (utility).|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the high}} mineralization, several mines have opened in the belt. Sherman Mine, {{northwest}} {{of the town of}} Temagami, was a major producer of iron ore. Mining operations began in 1968, and workings consisted of seven open pits: North Pit, East Pit, South Pit, West Pit and three relatively small open pits known as the Turtle Pits. A railroad was built from the Ontario Northland Railway to Sherman Mine in the 1960s to make transportation and shipping of iron ore easier and faster across Ontario. To the north, Temagami North was constructed as a resource town in the 1960s to supply Sherman Mine. With an average overall grade of 25% iron, the mine produced approximately 10,700tons of crude ore per day and its mill capacity was [...] of iron ore pellets per year. Operations at Sherman Mine ceased in 1990 after its owner Dofasco announced that they would be closing the mine. The municipality of Temagami made several approaches to Dofasco before the closer of Sherman Mine, offering a partnership in the community's future in terms of shared funding for a Sherman Park. However, it was informed during discussions with Dofasco's media executives that in the future they could not be counted on for maintenance funds for parks <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>that</b> was being done in partnership with the community. This caused a large attitudinal change from a few months earlier when the mine was associated with much of Temagami. The closure also {{had a significant impact on}} the economy of Temagami. There is still iron ore at Sherman Mine, but Dofasco were able to obtain it more cheaply elsewhere.|$|E

In {{an interview with}} UKF, he elaborated on his songwriting process for the album, saying: [...] "I make so many other types of music so I thought I’d sit down and write - no theme, no story.

50|$|Self-actualization is {{a concept}} {{developed}} by Abraham Maslow that is characterized by one becoming {{all they want to}} be, and can be, by maximizing their potential.

25|$|Colin McGinn {{argues that}} the Chinese room {{provides}} strong evidence that the hard problem of consciousness is fundamentally insoluble.

It is plain that any other method of probing the occupant of a Chinese room has the same difficulties in principle as exchanging questions and answers in Chinese.

5000|$|In Buddhism-related English literature, Anattā is {{rendered}} as [...] "not-Self", but this translation expresses an incomplete meaning, states Peter Harvey; {{a more complete}} rendering is [...] "non-Self" [...] because from its earliest days, Anattā doctrine denies that there is anything called a 'Self' in any person <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> and <b>that</b> a belief in 'Self' {{is a source of}} Dukkha (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness). It is also incorrect to translate Anattā simply as [...] "ego-less", according to Peter Harvey, because the Indian concept of ātman and attā is different from the Freudian concept of ego.|$|R
