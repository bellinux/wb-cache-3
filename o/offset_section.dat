None {{of the existing}} work in automatic reconstruction from 2 D orthographic views have addressed sectional views in detail.

The volume-based approach constructs the 3 D solid by a boolean combination of elementary solids. The elementary solids are formed by sweep operation on loops identified in the input views. The only adjustment {{to be made for}} the presence of sectional views is in the identification of loops that would form the elemental solids. In the algorithm, the conventions of engineering drawing for sectional views, are used to identify the loops correctly. The algorithm is simple and intuitive in nature.

The cavity created between the cylinder block and the sump houses a crankshaft that converts the reciprocating motion of the pistons to rotational motion.

Bulkheads in the crankcase form a half of every main bearing; the other half is a detachable cap. In some cases a single main bearing deck is used rather than several smaller caps. A connecting rod is connected to <b>offset</b> <b>sections</b> of the crankshaft (the crankpins) in one end and to the piston in the other end through the gudgeon pin and thus transfers the force and translates the reciprocating motion of the pistons to the circular motion of the crankshaft.

For constant velocity, these concepts are well understood but this approach often results in overly expensive survey designs.

Experience shows that AVO inversion methods based on amplitude-preserved prestack migration typically provides a more accurate lithology estimation than NMO-based AVO analysis. However, some artifacts may be introduced into the migration section, which can obscure the es-timate of reservoir properties. In this paper, I investigate the impact of migration deconvolution (MD) on AVO inversion. The MD method is applied to the images migrated from common offset sections in order to suppress the unwanted migration artifacts. Together with angle gathers, the AVO parameters are inverted using MD common reflection gathers.

Methods Thirty maxillary first permanent molars were selected. Mesiobuccal canals were randomly assigned (n = 15) to PG/PTN or SR/BR groups. Irrigation was performed with 5 % NaOCl and 10 % EDTA. Specimens were scanned (voxel size, 9. 1 μm) for matching volumes and surface areas and post-treatment analyses. Root canal centering ability, canal geometry enlargement, and thickness of dentinal wall at inner curvature were assessed at apical level and point of maximum curvature. Results were analyzed with 4 one-way analyses of variance. Results Canal centering ability was superior in PG/PTN (P =. 006 at apical level, P =. 025 at point of maximum curvature). PG/PTN demonstrated a more conservative increase of canal areas (P =. 027 at apical level, P =. 038 at point of maximum curvature). Centrifugal increase in canal diameters did not significantly differ between groups (P =. 65 at apical level, P =. 61 at point of maximum curvature). Inner dentinal wall thickness was less reduced with PG/PTN compared with SR/BR, with no statistical differences (P =. 23 at point of maximum curvature, P =. 89 at apical level).

Very little of this work has been directed at the seismic exploration imaging problem. In fact, {{most of the work}} has had application in sonar, medical and non-destructive testing applications. Here we present some initial results of applying this technology to the seismic imaging of a salt dome flank. We create a set of synthetic traces representing a multi-level, walk away VSP for a model composed of a simplified Gulf of Mexico vertical velocity gradient and an embedded overhanging salt dome. To process these data, we first apply the concepts of TRA to the synthetic traces. This creates a set of stacked traces without having to perform any velocity analysis or complicated processing. Each of these stacked traces is equivalent to the output of a spatially coincident, or zero offset, down hole source and receiver pair. Thus we have the equivalent of a zero offset seismic section as if it were collected from down hole sources and receivers. After having applied the TRA concepts, we then apply conventional post stack depth migration to this zero <b>offset</b> <b>section</b> to produce the final image of the salt dome flank. Our results show a very good image of the salt. In fact, the image created is nearly identical to an image actually using data from down hole, zero offset source and receiver pairs.

The convenient approximations of P-P and P-S reflection coefficient are obtained, which link the seismic data with the elastic parameters that {{are sensitive to the}} hydrocarbon existing in the rock.

In this paper, we derive the approximation of PS reflection coefficient from Zoeppritz equation, correct Aki and Richards’s approximation, and derive some equations of PS reflection coefficient possibly easy to be used in PS AVO analysis. We study the laboratory and well logging results, and show the difference between bulk modulus (κ) and rigidity or shear modulus (µ) is influenced by fluid-fill more purely, and it is a sensitive and quantitative indicator of gas existing. P-P and P-S reflection coefficient equations are expressed with the elastic parameters (λ and µ, or κ and µ) in the paper.

Demigration itself {{can be defined as}} the inverse of true amplitude migration.

In this thesis the artificially migrated inputs are computed by employing both a standard/classical approach and the PSDM simulator approach of NORSAR (SimPLI technology). A feasibility study has been carried out where the modeling by demigration concept has been compared with more standard modeling techniques based on dynamic ray tracing and Kirchhoff Helmholtz integral. Synthetic data were generated for three different geological structures; a syncline, an anticline, and a fault. The output from the various modeling methods were compared based on both visual inspection as well as quantitative measures of relative amplitude ratios. In addition, the synthetic datasets were migrated to see how well the original geological structures could be mapped back. The conclusions from this study were as follows;  The dynamic ray tracing method performed poor in the case of complex geology, as expected,  Modeling by demigration proved to be a feasible concept when benchmarked with the standard Kirchhoff Helmholtz modeling technique,  However, work needs to be carried out with respect to calibrations before direct (absolute) amplitude comparisons can be made, and  The SimPLI approach can represent an alternative to the standard artificial migration proposed in the original version of modeling by demigration...|$|E
