40|$|Abstract. As {{color gamut}} of digital <b>output</b> <b>device</b> greatly affects image appearance, {{accurate}} and effective gamut description for <b>output</b> <b>device</b> is intensively required for developing high-quality image reproduction technique based on gamut mapping. In this paper, {{we present a}} novel method to determine color gamut of <b>output</b> <b>device</b> by using a specific 3 D reconstruction technology and device ICC profile. First, we populate the device color space by uniform sampling in the RGB 3 -Dimensional space, and convert these sampling points to CMYK color space. Then, we work out the CIE LAB value of these points according to the ICC profile of <b>output</b> <b>device.</b> At last, in CIE LAB color space the boundary of these points is determined by using a gamut boundary descriptor based on Ball-Pivoting Algorithm (BPA) proposed by Bernardini. Compared with the results generated by ICC 3 D, our proposed method can compute device gamut more efficiently {{and at the same}} time give a more accurate gamut description of the <b>output</b> <b>device.</b> It will be help to develop effective gamut mapping algorithms for color reproduction...|$|R

25|$|Energy {{harvesting}} devices converting ambient {{energy into}} electrical energy have attracted {{much interest in}} both the military and commercial sectors. Some systems convert motion, {{such as that of}} ocean waves, into electricity to be used by oceanographic monitoring sensors for autonomous operation. Future applications may include high power <b>output</b> <b>devices</b> (or arrays of such devices) deployed at remote locations to serve as reliable power stations for large systems. Another application is in wearable electronics, where energy harvesting devices can power or recharge cellphones, mobile computers, radio communication equipment, etc. All of these devices must be sufficiently robust to endure long-term exposure to hostile environments and have a broad range of dynamic sensitivity to exploit the entire spectrum of wave motions.|$|E
25|$|Industrial {{automation}} incorporates {{programmable logic}} controllers in the manufacturing process. Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) use a processing system which allows for variation of controls of inputs and outputs using simple programming. PLCs make use of programmable memory, storing instructions and functions like logic, sequencing, timing, counting, etc. Using a logic based language, a PLC can receive a variety of inputs and return a variety of logical outputs, the input devices being sensors and <b>output</b> <b>devices</b> being motors, valves, etc. PLCs are similar to computers, however, while computers are optimized for calculations, PLCs are optimized for control task and use in industrial environments. They are built so that only basic logic-based programming knowledge is needed and to handle vibrations, high temperatures, humidity and noise. The greatest advantage PLCs offer is their flexibility. With the same basic controllers, a PLC can operate a range of different control systems. PLCs make it unnecessary to rewire a system to change the control system. This flexibility leads to a cost-effective system for complex and varied control systems.|$|E
