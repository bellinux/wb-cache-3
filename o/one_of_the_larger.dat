5|$|As <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> {{towns in}} the French Basque Country, Bayonne {{had been one of}} the main bases of ETA {{organisation}} there. From 1975 onwards this had prompted a reaction from anti-ETA groups. In April 1975, Mugalde, a Basque bookshop in the town, was bombed, though no one was injured. On 25 June 1979, Enrique Gómez Álvarez, an alleged ETA member, was killed by the Batallón Vasco Español (BVE), a right-wing paramilitary group active since 1975.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Charles F. Brown, {{who entered}} the laundry {{business}} in the Midwest in 1892, moved to Portland to build the Yale Laundry Building, and to operate an industrial power laundry on its premises. The building's basement contained boilers to heat wash water, and {{the main part of}} the first floor had beams capable of supporting heavy washing machines. The first and second floors had large windows to admit light and to release heat and steam. At the time of the building's construction, Portland had 68 commercial laundries of varied types and sizes. By 1916, the Yale Laundry, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> laundries, employed 125 people, many of whom were women.|$|E

5|$|Operation Overlord {{finally ended}} on 14 June and 1 ATF {{returned}} to Nui Dat. Overall, despite the heavy contact experienced early on, it had yielded little for the Australians although neither D445 or 33 NVA Regiment were encountered in Phuoc Tuy again. Overlord was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> task force {{operations of the}} war, while {{it was also the}} last joint US-Australian battalion-sized operation. Indeed, although the fighting continued, Australian operations began to wind down. On 18 August 1971, Prime Minister William McMahon announced that 1 ATF would cease operations in October, commencing a phased withdrawal. Ultimately, the last Australian forces were withdrawn from Vietnam by 1973.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the best-known}} peninsulas in Ireland are in County Kerry; the Dingle peninsula, the {{aforementioned}} Iveragh peninsula and the Beara peninsula. The Ards peninsula is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> peninsulas outside Kerry. The Inishowen peninsula in County Donegal includes Ireland's most northerly point, Malin Head and several important towns including Buncrana on Lough Swilly, Carndonagh and Moville on Lough Foyle. Ireland's most northerly land feature is Inishtrahull island, off Malin Head. Rockall Island may deserve this honour but its status is disputed, being claimed by the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Denmark (for the Faroe Islands) and Iceland. The most southerly point is the Fastnet Rock.|$|E
5|$|Stafford Meadow Brook {{begins on}} the Pocono Plateau. It is a {{mountain}} stream that flows the Moosic Mountains in Simersons Gap. At points, it also flows through a gorge or through dense brush. Mountains in the watershed include Coon Hill and Scrub Oak Mountain. The topography of the watershed is mountainous, with high steep hills {{that have been}} rounded by glaciation. The stream's valley is narrow. It is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> tributaries of the Lackawanna River. It is a second-order stream.|$|E

5|$|The Saw Mill River and its {{adjacent}} terrain conferred some tactical {{advantages to}} those who knew it. One skirmish began when a Patriot militiaman, Jake Acker, was hunting in a bushy area of the eastern flood plain at Elmsford. Spying {{a large group of}} British soldiers and Loyalist supporters on the road to Storm's tavern, Acker began sniping at them from his concealment. He fatally wounded one, changed his position amid the distraction, reloaded his musket, and killed another. Hearing the shots, other local Patriots came to Acker's aid, and eventually all but <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> force were killed or captured.|$|E

5|$|The {{supernova}} {{explosion that}} formed the Vela Supernova Remnant most likely occurred 10,000–20,000 years ago. In 1976, NASA astronomers suggested that inhabitants of the southern hemisphere may have witnessed this explosion and recorded it symbolically. A year later, archaeologist George Michanowsky recalled some incomprehensible ancient markings in Bolivia that were left by Native Americans. The carvings showed four small circles flanked by two larger circles. The smaller circles resemble stellar groupings in the constellations Vela and Carina. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> circles may represent the star Capella. Another circle is located near {{the position of the}} supernova remnant, George Michanowsky suggested this may represent the supernova explosion as witnessed by the indigenous residents.|$|E

5|$|While Burger King still {{utilizes}} {{a version}} of its revamped franchising system in the United States, outside of North America its international locations licenses are still sold on a regional basis with franchises owning exclusive development rights for a region or country. These regional franchises are known as master franchises, and are responsible for opening new restaurants, licensing new third party operators, and performing standards oversight of all restaurant locations in these countries; <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> examples of a master franchise is Hungry Jack's, which oversees over 300 restaurants in Australia.|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} {{evidence}} for settlement of the area now occupied by the town {{that dates back to}} the Iron Age, Arbroath's history as a town begins in the High Middle Ages with the founding of Arbroath Abbey in 1178. Arbroath grew considerably during the Industrial Revolution owing to the expansion of firstly the flax and secondly the jute industries and the engineering sector. A new harbour was built in 1839 and by the 20th century, Arbroath had become <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> fishing ports in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Halvdan Koht {{was born}} on 7 August 1873 in Tromsø, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> cities in Northern Norway. He was the second of four {{children}} born to Paul Steenstrup Koht (1844–1892), an educator and politician, and Betty Giæver (1845–1936), a part-time teacher {{with a penchant for}} singing, languages and drawing. Betty's antecedents were mixed: she was maternally descended from Northern Germany, yet on her father's side she was of Norwegian origin—a distinguished forebear on that side was her great-grandfather, the civil servant Jens Holmboe from Tromsø. Through the offspring of his maternal grand-uncle, Halvdan Koht was a third cousin of the parliamentarian Ola Krogseng Giæver. In Paul Koht's lineage, Kjeld Stub was a distant ancestor. The name Koht stems from German immigrants to Norway in the 17th century.|$|E

5|$|Many day hikes can {{be taken}} in the park. Back-country camping is allowed at campsites along the trails. A permit is {{required}} and {{can be obtained from}} certain visitor centers or arranged for in advance. Much of Glacier's back country is usually inaccessible to hikers until early June due to accumulated snow pack and avalanche risk, and many trails at higher altitudes remain snow packed until July. Campgrounds that allow vehicle access are found throughout the park, most of which are near <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> lakes. The campgrounds at St. Mary and at Apgar are open year-round, but conditions are primitive in the off-season, as the restroom facilities are closed and there is no running water. All campgrounds with vehicle access are usually open from mid-June until mid-September. Guide and shuttle services are also available.|$|E
5|$|Scott's restorations {{were not}} without their critics and caused much debate in {{architectural}} circles. Scott {{claimed to have}} archaeological evidence for his work, but the Liverpool architect, Samuel Huggins argued in an 1868 address to the Liverpool Architectural Society, that the alterations were less like restoration and more like rebuilding. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> changes was to shorten the south aisle and restyle it as an apse. The changes also proposed {{the addition of a}} spire above the existing tower, but this proposal was later rejected. Samuel's further paper of 1871 entitled On so-called restorations of our cathedral and abbey churches compelled the Dean to attempt to answer the criticism. The debate contributed to the establishment of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings.|$|E
