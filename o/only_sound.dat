5|$|Bamber {{arrived at}} the {{farmhouse}} one or two minutes after the police. They waited for a tactical firearms group to arrive, which turned up at 5am and decided to wait until daylight before trying to enter. Police determined that all {{the doors and windows}} to the house were shut, except for the window in the main bedroom on the first floor. Using a loudhailer, they spent two hours trying to communicate with Sheila. The <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> they reported from the house was a dog barking.|$|E
5|$|Parsifal was {{expressly}} composed for {{the stage}} at Bayreuth {{and many of the}} most famous recordings of the opera come from live performances on that stage. In the pre-LP era, Karl Muck conducted excerpts from the opera at Bayreuth. These are still considered some of the best performances of the opera on disc. They also contain the <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> evidence of the bells constructed for the work's premiere, which were melted down for scrap during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the failure}} of Adlertag and {{considerable}} loss rates on 15, 16 and 17 August, Kesselring convinced Göring that the <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> strategy was to continue to send heavily escorted bombers to destroy British airfields. Kesselring also advocated the use of Jagdgeschwader (fighter wings) in free-chase tactics. Messerschmitt Bf 109 single-engine fighters were to be sent out {{in advance of the}} main raids to force the British fighters into large-scale air battles which, in theory, would destroy RAF aircraft in combat and deplete the British defences. However, this time, Kesselring changed his operational methods. In consultation with Hugo Sperrle, commanding Luftflotte 3 (Air Fleet 3), he chose not to scatter his effort against a large number of targets. Instead, he narrowed down the targets to a short list in order to concentrate his strength and striking power. Sector stations RAF Kenley, North Weald, Hornchurch and Biggin Hill were chosen as the prime targets.|$|E
60|$|A moment passed. The {{crackling}} of {{the fire}} and the ticking of the clock were the <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> audible in the room.|$|R
50|$|Kormac has {{recently}} been commissioned by Jameson to make two tracks using <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> he recorded at their factories in Dublin and Cork.|$|R
50|$|He {{distinguishes between}} the primary {{process in which}} the child {{experiences}} <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> (fantasy), and the secondary process, in which the child gives meaning to these sounds (reality).|$|R
25|$|Some older systems {{featured}} a simple beeper as their <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> output, {{as the original}} ZX Spectrum and IBM PC; despite this, many skilled programmers were able to produce unexpected rich music with this bare hardware, where the sound is fully generated by the system's CPU by direct control of the beeper.|$|E
25|$|By daybreak, the Marines had {{completed}} unloading their stores and equipment, though the artillery pieces and their ammunition were left aboard ship. The remaining companies of the battalion came ashore, and Company C was withdrawn from its isolated hill outpost. The <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> in the thickets was the cooing of mourning doves, a sound which Marines would later learn {{was a favorite}} signal call used by Spanish loyalist guerrilla forces.|$|E
25|$|Since timpani {{have a long}} sustain, {{muffling}} or dampening is {{an inherent}} part of playing. Often, timpanists will muffle notes so they <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> for the length indicated by the composer. However, early timpani did not resonate nearly as long as modern timpani, so composers often wrote a note when the timpanist was to hit the drum without concern for sustain. Today, timpanists must use their ear and the score to determine the length the note should sound.|$|E
5000|$|In round 3, the Cluegiver may not use {{any words}} at all. <b>Only</b> <b>sounds</b> and charades {{may be used}} for each clue. Teammates get one guess only and passing is allowed.|$|R
60|$|They {{arrived at}} the old house, and stood, listening, {{in the shadow of}} the doorway. The <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> were those of distant barking dogs, and of the bugles at the barracks.|$|R
60|$|A torch spluttered {{suddenly}} in its sconce, and the fierce hissing of the fire--like some monster licking its chops over a bloody meal--were the <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> that disturbed the stillness that ensued.|$|R
25|$|Compact disc (CD) is {{a digital}} optical disc data storage format {{released}} in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> recordings but was later adapted for {{storage of data}} (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. The first commercially available Audio CD player, the Sony CDP-101, was released October 1982 in Japan.|$|E
25|$|Job was quiet, brief in words, and the <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> {{heard from}} his lips was the Jesus prayer. For many days and weeks he would retreat into his locked cave, so narrow that entry is difficult, and so small that it was {{impossible}} to sit, stand or lie conveniently. From the long periods of kneeling, his knees were covered with wounds, and wearing knee-marks into the rock floor. His disciple Dosyfey recounts that he saw supernatural light coming from the depths of the cave, shining for two hours onto the opposite side of the church. Dosyfey records that at the sight was terrified and fell to the ground.|$|E
500|$|The {{sound effects}} and music for Lost Luggage {{were created by}} Larry Minor. According to Runyon, the game {{was the first to}} {{integrate}} music on the 2600 as opposed to <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> effects. Salvo estimated that Lost Luggage took a total of four weeks to complete. A four-minute advertising jingle was made by Byron Parks for the game. Apollo founder Pat Roper was [...] "fishing for ad material", and Parks belonged to a sound studio which Roper also owned. The jingle was never used, and in a 2013 interview Runyon recalled that he did not [...] "know or remember where it was intended for use." ...|$|E
50|$|The missile {{jettison}} alarm on Ohio-class submarines {{does not}} have a handle like other submarine alarms. It is a key-activated alarm that <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> upon energizing the missile jettison panel located in the Missile Control Center.|$|R
60|$|The jungle {{was filled}} with countless birds, of all sorts, sizes, and colors. Some of these sang in a fairly tuneful fashion, but the {{majority}} uttered <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> which were as painful to the hearing as they were tiresome.|$|R
5000|$|The title means [...] "Let's meet at 7 o'clock", {{with a minor}} play {{on words}} as the final shō not <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> like the Japanese word for [...] "show" [...] but also is written as if were the latter word.|$|R
500|$|Considerable {{restoration}} {{was required}} to prepare Live at the Royal Albert Hall for release in 2010, since much of Cooper's footage had been lost during the ensuing decades or damaged. Olivia Harrison explained: [...] "We laid music where we had picture and we cheated {{a little bit with}} picture where <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> existed to create over an hour of the concert …" [...] A separate selection on the DVD presents the audio for a more complete version of the performance, lasting over 90 minutes. Also included is a short segment where Anoushka Shankar and Paul Hicks, as remaster producers, work on the concert audio in a San Diego studio and are visited by Shankar and Olivia.|$|E
500|$|During 1931, NSS {{was busy}} closing shipyards {{elsewhere}} in the country, while an order from the Admiralty for two destroyers kept Palmer's working until mid-1932. The second of these ships, , was the last ship launched from the yard, on 19 July 1932. [...] By this time, Palmer's was insolvent, but retained a faint hope of further naval contracts. These failed to materialise, and in June 1933 the firm's creditors appointed a receiver. By December 1933 rumours of NSS interest in the yard were appearing in the press, and in the House of Commons Walter Runciman, the President of the Board of Trade, told members: [...] "There {{is nothing to be}} gained by giving Jarrow the impression that Palmer's can be revived". He continued: [...] "Would it not be very much better to make a clean sweep of that as a shipyard, and throw open to the world for sale what is one of the finest and most convenient sites anywhere in Europe?" [...] Despite efforts by management and workers to find an alternative solution, in the early summer of 1934 NSS acquired the yard, closed it, and began to dismantle its plant. Blythe wrote: [...] "The <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> to compete with the unfamiliar noise of the marsh birds... was the ring of the breakers' hammers." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's cover artwork {{features}} {{a photo of}} Donald Fagen as a disc jockey, wearing a collared shirt and tie, speaking into a RCA 77DX microphone. In front of him is a turntable (16inch '50s model, with a [...] tonearm), an ashtray, and a pack of Chesterfield King cigarettes. Visible {{on the table with}} the record player, is the cover of the 1958 jazz album Sonny Rollins and the Contemporary Leaders (one of Fagen's favorite albums). On the wall behind is a large clock, indicating that the time is 4:09. An advertisement in Billboard shortly before the album's release described the album cover: [...] "At 4:09 a.m., silence and darkness have taken hold of the city. The <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> is the voice of The Nightfly". Fagen appeared on the album cover despite his reclusive nature. [...] "It was an autobiographical album so it seemed like I might as well go public with it," [...] he said. The cover was shot in Fagen's apartment in the Upper East Side of Manhattan by photographer James Hamilton. Two shoots were arranged because in the first, the RCA microphone was facing the wrong direction. Gale Sasson and Vern Yenor are credited with the cover's set design.|$|E
60|$|For {{some time}} the rapid dip of our paddles and {{the rush of}} our canoe through the water were the <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> that were heard. Then Peterkin spoke again. He could never keep silence for any great length of time.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{stifling}} afternoon. As I trod {{the yellow}} gravel the quivering atmosphere all but blinded me with its reflected glare. The <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> {{to be heard}} were the clang of a milkman's hand-cart, and the pirouettes of a distant piano.|$|R
50|$|<b>Only</b> major <b>sound</b> correspondences are listed.|$|R
2500|$|The Dinosaur: big {{but not too}} bright—a sort of sauropod with spinal plates like a stegosaurus. [...] Sometimes called Gronk, {{which is}} the <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> he makes (although he can talk fluently in recent strips).|$|E
2500|$|After {{his initial}} meeting with Chauvel at Lajjun on 22 September {{regarding}} the proposed pursuit, Allenby replied on 25 September to Wilson regarding pressure for an advance to Aleppo. [...] "I am firmly {{of the opinion}} that the <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> policy is to advance by stages as in the past, unless and until the War Cabinet is prepared to undertake a combined Naval and Military operation on a large scale at Alexandretta, and to maintain by sea the military forces employed in it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... is a second-year {{student at}} Fujimi High School with pink hair styled in twin tails. She is the {{daughter}} of an influential Uyoku dantai (right-wing) [...] politician. A self-proclaimed genius, Saya uses her knowledge and deductive capabilities to help the group escape from harm, being among the first to conclude that [...] "they" [...] were attracted to <b>only</b> <b>sound.</b> Despite coming from a prestigious family, she despised her parents, who she thought had given up on finding her, but reconciles with them during the raid on the family estate.|$|E
50|$|Jayanti Majri {{is just a}} 10-minute {{drive from}} Chandigarh but it’s an {{altogether}} different world. Silence prevails here. The <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> that reach the ears are the rustling of leaves, the humming bees, fluttering wings of a butterfly and occasional clinking of a temple bell.|$|R
5000|$|Chapel Street Raid - 8 {{citizens}} {{were killed when}} a Dornier 217 dropped four bombs on South Street and Essex Street on 28 September 1942. The air raid siren, in this case, <b>only</b> <b>sounded</b> after the bombs had already dropped, causing outcry in the town.|$|R
60|$|Around {{and around}} the room they circled, the boy always advancing, Paul of Merely always retreating. The din of their clashing swords and the heavy {{breathing}} of the older man were the <b>only</b> <b>sounds,</b> except as they brushed against a bench or a table.|$|R
2500|$|Greg Kot of Rolling Stone {{gave the}} album two stars out of five, remarking, [...] "Good Charlotte {{are much more}} persuasive when they let their {{vulnerability}} crack through the surface of these slightly overbaked songs, in which elaborate production touches mask the band's three-chord limitations." [...] Kristina Feliciano of Entertainment Weekly deemed the record generic, writing, [...] "These 14 tidily produced songs not <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> a lot like each other, they also resemble ones by someone else — namely, blink-182. And that band’s tunes derive from elsewhere still." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, a {{television}} advert was launched worldwide for the Renault Clio MTV Limited edition featuring {{a man who}} was saying [...] "Get up ah!" [...] all the time, it was actually the <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> he can hear from a Clio passing {{in front of his house}} early in the morning, then the advert shows the five men inside the Clio and moving their heads to the rhythm of the James Brown song [...] "Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine". Same advertising made in Argentina with the Clio II in 2000 with this song.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a speech}} to the Hawarden Amateur Horticultural Society on 17 August 1876, Gladstone remarked [...] "I am delighted to see how many young boys and girls have come forward to obtain honourable marks of {{recognition}} on this occasion,—if any effectual good is to be done to them, it must be done by teaching and encouraging them and helping them to help themselves. All the people who pretend to take your own concerns out of your own hands and to do everything for you, I won't say they are impostors; I won't even say they are quacks; but I do say they are mistaken people. The <b>only</b> <b>sound,</b> healthy description of countenancing and assisting these institutions is that which teaches independence and self-exertion". Lord Kilbracken, one of Gladstone's secretaries added: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{sequences}} where Hudson's character Dr Snow {{finds the}} secret base using <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> he {{heard on the}} journey was used in Joe Smith, American and its remake The Big Operator {{as well as being}} borrowed for an almost identical scene in the 1992 film Sneakers.|$|R
60|$|For {{some time}} {{the click of}} the needles and the tick of the clock were the <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> audible, and the ex-pilot had just arrived at the {{conclusion}} that his friend had abandoned him to his fate, when there came a low tapping at the door.|$|R
60|$|The two lads {{remained}} motionless {{in the saddle}} for several minutes, listening. No other howl reached their ears, and the <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> were that of the rushing stream as it tumbled over some rocks, and {{the cries of the}} night birds and the humming of the insects.|$|R
