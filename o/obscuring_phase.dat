40|$|Summary. The <b>obscured</b> <b>phase</b> of QSOs, as well {{as their}} {{accretion}} history, can be best followed by observing QSOs bright in> 10 MeV gamma-rays. By analysing the resonant absorption troughs in spectral energy distribution of flaring QSOs one can measure the (baryonic) absorbing column and baryonic content of the QSO host galaxy, while the flare strength will give information on the accretion rate of the QSO powering supermassive black hole. By measuring the baryonic absorbing column for QSOs at different redshifts one can follow the early obscured evolution of AGN at redshifts up to z∼ 6. 1 Obscured AGNs The idea that substantial absorption in AGN could be a definite characteristic of the early phases of QSO evolution [2] was invoked to explain the submillimeter observations of X-ray absorbed AGN at z∼ 1 – 3, that have shown strong emission at 850 µm [10].

Such dusty quasars are often interpreted as sources `in transition', from dust-enshrouded starbursts to unobscured luminous quasars, along the evolutionary sequence. Here we consider {{the role of the}} active galactic nucleus (AGN) radiative feedback, driven by radiation pressure on dust, in high-luminosity, dust-obscured sources. We analyse how the radiation pressure-driven dusty shell models, with different shell mass configurations, may be applied to the different populations of dusty quasars reported in recent observations. We find that expanding shells, sweeping up matter from the surrounding environment, may account for prolonged obscuration in dusty quasars, e. g. for a central luminosity of L ∼ 10 ^ 47 erg/s, a typical <b>obscured</b> <b>phase</b> (with extinction in the range A_V∼ 1 - 10 mags) may last a few ∼ 10 ^ 6 yr.

These stars exploded as supernovae and polluted the material from which subsequent generations of stars were made. Astronomers have had difficulty in finding stars made of the pure Big Bang material, but they have found stars with very little polluting material.

Many independent techniques have been devised to date the oldest stars and stellar systems in the Universe. Some of them are briefly reviewed. The age of the oldest stars is now converging on a value in the range from 12 to 15 thousand million years. However, a large uncertainty still exists and a value as a large as 17 to 18 thousand million years cannot be totally ruled out. Such a large value would be difficult to reconcile with the age of the Universe based on cosmological data.

We use radiative transfer simulations in a cosmological context to investigate the implications for the ionisation state of the inhomogeneous IGM surrounding this quasar. Our simulations show that the transmission profile is consistent with an IGM {{in the vicinity of}} the quasar with a volume averaged HI fraction of f_HI> 0. 1 and that ULAS J 1120 + 0641 has been bright for 10 ^ 6 [...] 10 ^ 7 yr.

We find that a large fraction (22. 0 ± 2. 5 per cent) are detected in the 4 Ms Chandra/Advanced CCD Image Spectrometer observations in the field, implying a high AGN content in these massive galaxies. To investigate further the relationship between these AGN and their hosts, we create four subsamples, based on their star formation rates (star-forming versus quiescent) and galaxy size (compact versus extended), following Barro et al. and perform X-ray spectral fitting. We find a clear effect whereby the AGN in compact galaxies - be they star forming or quiescent - show significantly higher luminosities and levels of obscuration than the AGN in extended galaxies. These results provide clear evidence for two modes of black hole growth in massive galaxies at high redshift. The dominant growth mode is a luminous, <b>obscured</b> <b>phase</b> which occurs overwhelmingly in compact galaxies while another lower luminosity, unobscured phase is predominantly seen in extended galaxies.

40|$|Line and {{continuum}} {{studies at}} centimeter through submillimeter wavelengths address probe {{deep into the}} earliest, most active and dust <b>obscured</b> <b>phases</b> of galaxy formation, and reveal the molecular and cool atomic gas. We summarize the techniques of radio astronomy to perform these studies, then review the progress on radio studies of galaxy formation. The dominant work {{over the last decade}} has focused on massive, luminous starburst galaxies (submm galaxies and AGN host galaxies). The far infrared luminosities are ~ 1 e 13 Lsun, implying star formation rates, SFR > 1 e 3 Msun/year. Molecular gas reservoirs are found with masses: M(H_ 2) > 1 e 10 (alpha/ 0. 8 }) Msun. The CO excitation in these luminous systems is much higher than in low redshift spiral galaxies. Imaging of the gas distribution and dynamics suggests strongly interacting and merging galaxies, indicating gravitationally induced, short duration (~ 1 e 7 year) starbursts. These systems correspond to a major star formation episode in massive galaxies in proto-clusters at intermediate to high redshift. Recently, radio observations have probed the more typical star forming galaxy population (SFR ~ 100 Msun/year), during the peak epoch of Universal star formation (z ~ 1. 5 to 2. 5). These observations reveal massive gas reservoirs without hyper-starbursts, and show that active star formation occurs over a wide range in galaxy stellar mass. The conditions in this gas are comparable to those found in the Milky Way disk. A key result is that the peak epoch of star formation in the Universe also corresponds to an epoch when the baryon content of star forming galaxies was dominated by molecular gas, not stars. We consider the possibility of tracing out the dense gas history of the Universe, and perform initial, admittedly gross, calculations.

40|$|Understanding the late-stage {{evolution}} of the most massive stars such as η Carinae is challenging because no true analogs of η Car have been clearly identified in the Milky Way or other galaxies. In Khan et. al. (2013), we utilized Spitzer IRAC images of 7 nearby (≲ 4 Mpc) galaxies to search for such analogs, and found 34 candidates with flat or red mid-IR spectral energy distributions. Here, in Paper II, we present our characterization of these candidates using multi-wavelength data from the optical through the far-IR. Our search detected no true analogs of η Car, which implies an eruption rate that is a fraction 0. 01 ≲ F ≲ 0. 19 of the ccSN rate. This is roughly consistent with each M_ZAMS≳ 70 M_ star undergoing 1 or 2 outbursts in its lifetime. However, we do identify a significant population of 18 lower luminosity ((L/L_) ≃ 5. 5 - 6. 0) dusty stars. Stars enter this phase {{at a rate that}} is fraction 0. 09 ≲ F ≲ 0. 55 of the ccSN rate, and this is consistent with all 25 < M_ZAMS < 60 M_ stars undergoing an <b>obscured</b> <b>phase</b> at most lasting a few thousand years once or twice.

This data modulation technique employs a finite-state Markov chain following a four-state trellis to encode user data in the electronic domain. The encoding redistributes the SPECTS O-CDMA user data bits across four different wave-forms to defeat the eavesdropper attacks on upstream links via power detectors or differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) receivers. The four-state encoder-decoder is implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) with high-speed serial transceivers. A SPECTS O-CDMA testbed with four-state en-coded data modulation at up to 2. 5 Gb/s/user is demonstrated and its single user link security is tested using a DPSK demodulator to emulate the eavesdropping detection. The security test verifies that this modulation technique effectively prevented interception by DPSK detection. The four-state coding can be extended to be time variable through switching among several trellis state definitions to achieve more rigorous security.

40|$|Aims. A {{complete}} {{census of}} obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) {{is necessary to}} reveal {{the history of the}} super massive black hole (SMBH) growth and galaxy evolution in the Universe given the complex feedback processes and the fact that much of this growth occurs in an <b>obscured</b> <b>phase.</b> In this context, hard X-ray surveys and dedicated follow-up observations represent a unique tool for selecting highly absorbed AGN and for characterizing the obscuring matter surrounding the SMBH. Here we focus on the absorption and reflection occurring in highly luminous, quasar-like AGN, to study the relation between the geometry of the absorbing matter and the AGN nature (e. g. X-ray, optical, and radio properties), and to help to determine the column density dependency on the AGN luminosity. Methods. The Swift/BAT nine-month survey observed 153 AGN, all with ultra-hard X-ray BAT fluxes in excess of 10 (exp 11) erg per square centimeter and an average redshift of 0. 03. Among them, four of the most luminous BAT AGN (44. 73 less than LogLBAT less than 45. 31) were selected as targets of Suzaku follow-up observations: J 2246. 0 + 3941 (3 C 452), J 0407. 4 + 0339 (3 C 105), J 0318. 7 + 6828, and J 0918. 5 + 0425. The column density, scattered/reflected emission, the properties of the Fe K line, and a possible variability are fully analyzed. For the latter, the spectral properties from Chandra, XMM-Newton and Swift/XRT public observations were compared with the present Suzaku analysis, adding an original spectral analysis when non was available from the literature. Results. Of our sample, 3 C 452 is the only certain Compton-thick AGN candidate because of i) the high absorption (N(sub H) approximately 4 10 (exp 23) per square centimeter) and strong Compton reflection; ii) the lack of variability; iii) the "buried" nature, i. e. the low scattering fraction (less than 0. 5 %) and the extremely low relative [OIII] luminosity. In contrast 3 C 105 is not reflection-dominated, despite the comparable column density, X-ray luminosity and radio morphology, but shows a strong long-term variability in flux and scattering fraction, consistent with the soft emission being scattered from a distant region (e. g., the narrow emission line region). The sample presents high (greater than 100) X-to- [OIII] luminosity ratios, with an extreme value of R(sup X) (sub [OIII]) approximately 800 for 3 C 452, confirming the [OIII] luminosity to be affected by residual extinction in presence of mild absorption, especially for "buried" AGN such as 3 C 452. Three of our targets are powerful FRII radio galaxies, which is shown by their high luminosity and absorption; this makes them the most luminous and absorbed AGN of the BAT Seyfert survey despite the inversely proportional N(sub H) - L(sub X) relation...|$|R

Using a new, volume-limited (z <= 0. 08) catalog of visually-selected major mergers and galaxy-galaxy interactions from the SDSS, with stellar masses above 2 x 10 ^ 10 Msun, we find that major mergers (interactions) are 5 - 17 (3 - 5) {{times more likely to}} have red [3. 4]-[4. 6] colors associated with dust-obscured or `dusty' AGNs, compared to non-merging galaxies with similar masses. Using published fiber spectral diagnostics, we map the [3. 4]-[4. 6] versus [4. 6]-[12] colors of different emission-line galaxies and find one-quarter of Seyferts have colors indicative of a dusty AGN. We find that AGNs are five times more likely to be obscured when hosted by a merging galaxy, half of AGNs hosted by a merger are dusty, and we find no enhanced frequency of optical AGNs in merging over non-merging galaxies. We conclude that undetected AGNs missed at shorter wavelengths are at the heart of the ongoing AGN-merger connection debate. The vast majority of mergers hosting dusty AGNs are star-forming and located at the centers of Mhalo< 10 ^ 13 Msun groups. Assuming plausibly short duration dusty-AGN phases, we speculate that a large fraction of gas-rich mergers experience a brief <b>obscured</b> AGN <b>phase,</b> in agreement with the strong connection between central star formation and black hole growth seen in merger simulations.

40|$|We present new ALMA Band 7 (∼ 340 GHz) {{observations}} of the dense gas tracers HCN, HCO^+, and CS in the local, single-nucleus, ultraluminous infrared galaxy IRAS 13120 - 5453. We find centrally enhanced HCN (4 - 3) emission, relative to HCO^+ (4 - 3), but do not find evidence for radiative pumping of HCN. Considering {{the size of the}} starburst (0. 5 kpc) and the estimated supernovae rate of ∼ 1. 2 yr^- 1, the high HCN/HCO^+ ratio can be explained by an enhanced HCN abundance as a result of mechanical heating by the supernovae, though the active galactic nucleus and winds may also contribute additional mechanical heating. The starburst size implies a high Σ_IR of 4. 7 × 10 ^ 12 L_ kpc^- 2, slightly below predictions of radiation-pressure limited starbursts. The HCN line profile has low-level wings, which we tentatively interpret as evidence for outflowing dense molecular gas. However, the dense molecular outflow seen in the HCN line wings is unlikely to escape the galaxy and is destined to return to the nucleus and fuel future star formation. We also present modeling of Herschel {{observations of}} the H_ 2 O lines and find a nuclear dust temperature of ∼ 40 K. IRAS 13120 - 5453 has a lower dust temperature and Σ_IR than is inferred for the systems termed "compact obscured nuclei" (such as Arp 220 and Mrk 231). If IRAS 13120 - 5453 has undergone a compact <b>obscured</b> nucleus <b>phase,</b> we are likely witnessing it {{at a time when the}} feedback has already inflated the nuclear ISM and diluted star formation in the starburst/AGN core.

40|$|Slave boson {{calculations}} {{have been}} carried out in the three-band tJ model for the high-T_c cuprates, with the inclusion of coupling to oxygen breathing mode phonons. Phonon-induced Van Hove nesting leads to a phase separation between a hole-doped domain and a (magnetic) domain near half filling, with long-range Coulomb forces limiting the separation to a nanoscopic scale. Strong correlation effects pin the Fermi level close to, but not precisely at the Van Hove singularity (VHS), which can enhance the tendency to phase separation. The resulting dispersions have been calculated, both in the uniform phases and in the phase separated regime. In the latter case, distinctly different dispersions are found for large, random domains and for regular (static) striped arrays, and a hypothetical form is presented for dynamic striped arrays. The doping dependence of the latter is found to provide an excellent description of photoemission and thermodynamic experiments on pseudogap formation in underdoped cuprates. In particular, the multiplicity of observed gaps is explained as a combination of flux phase plus charge density wave (CDW) gaps along with a superconducting gap. The largest gap is associated with VHS nesting. The apparent smooth evolution of this gap with doping masks a crossover from CDW-like effects near optimal doping to magnetic effects (flux phase) near half filling. A crossover from large Fermi surface to hole pockets with increased underdoping is found. In the weakly overdoped regime, the CDW undergoes a quantum phase transition (T_CDW→ 0), which could be <b>obscured</b> by <b>phase</b> separation.

40|$|I {{will present}} {{a study of the}} {{multi-frequency}} properties of the Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS 00183 - 7111 at z = 0. 327, connecting ALMA sub-mm/mm observations with those at high energies, with the primary purpose to verify at what level the gas (traced by the CO) is responsible for the obscuration observed in X-rays (Ruffa et al. in prep.). Most of ULIRGs are known to host a heavily obscured AGN in its nuclear regions, and this fraction increases at increasing infrared luminosity. The detection of the most heavily obscured sources is crucial to shed light on the <b>obscured</b> accretion <b>phase</b> in black hole growth, the AGN/host galaxy co-evolution issue, and eventually estimate their contribution to the X-ray cosmic background. To link the sub-mm/mm to the X-ray properties of I 00183, ALMA archival Cycle 0 data in Band 3 (87 GHz) and Band 6 (270 GHz) have been calibrated and analyzed, with the main goal to provide an improvement with respect to the available archival products and results. The high-energy data consists of Chandra, XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations which allow a broad coverage of the spectrum in the energy range 0. 5 − 30 keV. Chandra and XMM archival data were used, with an exposure time of 22 and 22. 2 ks, respectively. The 100 ks NuSTAR are still private and the spectra were obtained by courtesy of the PI (K. Iwasawa). The main results show how the molecular gas in the central regions of I 00183 can be considered responsible for a significant fraction of the AGN obscuration; further results, such a hint of an offset between the line and the continuum emission in ALMA Band 3 data, suggest interesting future perspectives for this work...|$|R
40|$|Automatic source {{detection}} and classification tools based on machine learning (ML) algorithms are growing in popularity {{due to their}} efficiency when dealing with large amounts of data simultaneously {{and their ability to}} work in multidimensional parameter spaces. In this work, we present a new, automated method of outlier selection based on support vector machine (SVM) algorithm called one-class SVM (OCSVM), which uses the training data as one class to construct a model of 'normality' in order to recognize novel points. We test the performance of OCSVM algorithm on Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) data trained on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) sources. Among others, we find ∼ 40, 000 sources with abnormal patterns which can be associated with obscured and unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) source candidates. We present the preliminary estimation of the clustering properties of these objects and find that the unobscured AGN candidates are preferentially found in less massive dark matter haloes (M_DMH∼ 10 ^ 12. 4) than the obscured candidates (M_DMH∼ 10 ^ 13. 2). This result contradicts the unification theory of AGN sources and indicates that the <b>obscured</b> and unobscured <b>phases</b> of AGN activity take place in different evolutionary paths defined by different environments.

40|$|The {{phase diagram}} of the DSPC/DOPC/cholesterol {{biomembrane}} model system was recently determined by studies in our laboratory. However, the component DOPC does not occur in animal cell plasma membranes, but was chosen for convenience in solving the phase diagram. In my study, DOPC was replaced stepwise by the naturally-occurring SOPC to determine {{its effect on the}} high cholesterol boundary of the L?+Lo two-phase region. Giant unilamellar vesicles with the chosen compositions, probed with the fluorescent dye C 12 : 0 -DiI, were made by electroswelling and their phase behaviors were examined by fluorescence microscopy. From 0 to 45 % replacement of DOPC by SOPC, the middle part of the boundary shifts only a small amount, from cholesterol mole fraction 0. 38 down to mole fraction 0. 30 ? 0. 35. The L? side of the boundary remains essentially unchanged. Above 50 % replacement, photo-induced artifacts <b>obscure</b> the real <b>phase</b> behavior at the middle part of the boundary, but might represent the actual boundary termination. Above 70 % replacement of DOPC by SOPC, no phase-separation was observed for the L? side of the boundary.

40|$|Abstract- Existing power {{management}} techniques operate by reducing performance capacity (frequency, voltage, resource size) when performance demand is low, {{such as at}} idle or similar low activity phases. In the case of multi-core systems, the performance and power demand is the aggregate demand of all cores in the system. Monitoring aggregate demand makes detection of phase changes difficult (active-toidle, idle-to-active, etc.) since aggregate <b>phase</b> behavior <b>obscures</b> the underlying <b>phases</b> generated by the workloads on individual cores. This causes sub-optimal {{power management}} and over-provisioning of power resources. In this paper, we address these problems through core-level, activity prediction. The core-level view makes detection of phase changes more accurate, yielding more opportunities for efficient power management. Due to the difficulty in anticipating activity level changes, existing operating system power management strategies rely on reaction rather than prediction. This causes sub-optimal power and performance since changes in performance capacity by the power manager lag changes in performance demand. To address this problem we propose the Periodic Power Phase Predictor (PPPP). This activity level predictor decreases SYSMark 2007 client/desktop processor power consumption by 5. 4 % and increases performance by 3. 8 % compared to the reactive scheme used in Windows Vista operating system. Applying the predictor {{to the prediction of}} processor power, we improve accuracy by 4. 8 % compared to a reactive scheme.

40|$|The <b>obscured</b> {{accretion}} <b>phase</b> in BH {{growth is}} a key ingredient in many models linking the AGN activity with the evolution of their host galaxy. At present, a complete census of obscured AGN is still missing. The purpose of this work is to assess {{the reliability of the}} [NeV] emission line at 3426 A to pick up obscured AGN up to z~ 1 by assuming that [NeV] is a reliable proxy of the intrinsic AGN luminosity and using moderately deep X-ray data to characterize the amount of obscuration. A sample of 69 narrow-line (Type 2) AGN at z= 0. 65 - 1. 20 were selected from the 20 k-zCOSMOS Bright galaxy sample {{on the basis of the}} presence of the [NeV] emission. The X-ray properties of these galaxies were then derived using the Chandra-COSMOS coverage of the field; the X-ray-to-[NeV] flux ratio, coupled with X-ray spectral and stacking analyses, was then used to infer whether Compton-thin or Compton-thick absorption were present in these sources. Then the [NeV] luminosity function was computed to estimate the space density of Compton-thick (CT) AGN at z~ 0. 8. Twenty-three sources were detected by Chandra, and their properties are consistent with moderate obscuration (on average, ~a few 10 ^{ 22 } cm^- 2). The X-ray properties of the remaining 46 X-ray undetected Type 2 AGN were derived using X-ray stacking analysis. Current data indicate that a fraction as high as ~ 40 % of the present sample is likely to be CT. The space density of CT AGN with logL_ 2 - 10 keV> 43. 5 at z= 0. 83 is (9. 1 +/- 2. 1) 10 ^{- 6 } Mpc^{- 3 }, in good agreement with both XRB model expectations and the previously measured space density for objects in a similar redshift and luminosity range. We regard our selection technique for CT AGN as clean but not complete, since even a mild extinction in the NLR can suppress [NeV] emission. Therefore, our estimate of their space density should be considered as a lower limit. Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, A&A, in pres...|$|R
40|$|We present high-resolution, {{near-infrared}} {{images of}} a sample of five low-mass young stellar objects in the Taurus-Auriga dark cloud, mostly observed with the 'shift and add' technique, together with deep polarimetric images. These systems are at the 'Class I' phase of evolution, prior to the T Tauri phase. Monte Carlo models tailored to the individual sources {{support the view that}} the flux distribution of the circumstellar nebulosity arises from an envelope with a bipolar cavity, but show that dust in outflows can also be prominent in the near-infrared. The source IRAS 04302 + 2247 is analysed in detail, since it displays a unique quadrupolar morphology, which is explained in terms of a system oriented precisely edge-on with a perpendicular outflow. The masses of the envelopes derived from the models are in good agreement with estimates obtained from submillimetre thermal fluxes and estimates derived from CS(J = 2 - 1) emission. Constraints are placed on envelope and cavity structure, indicating higher density near the equatorial plane, smooth, continuous density profiles and physically thin inner discs. Three of the five systems show evidence for two bipolar cavity/outflow systems, perhaps indicating that these are close binaries. The very high (up to 80 per cent) degrees of polarization observed in the envelopes show that the scattering is dominated by small, interstellar-type dust grains, and the morphologies and high polarizations of the cores show that the protostars themselves are usually <b>obscured</b> at this <b>phase</b> of evolution, even at 3. 7 μm. © 1997 RAS...|$|R
40|$|We analyze deep X-ray, {{optical and}} {{mid-infrared}} Spitzer {{observations of the}} CDF-N/GOODS-N region to study 13 submillimeter-detected galaxies (SMGs) with spectroscopic redshifts (median z= 2. 2). We find a correlation between the estimated stellar and X-ray luminosity, implying that masses of the black holes {{may be related to}} the stellar masses of their host galaxies. Although the submillimeter emission implies that these galaxies are undergoing an epoch of intense star-formation, the Spitzer data reveal a massive stellar population already in place. These stellar masses are then compared to previously published black hole mass estimates derived from the X-ray luminosities under the assumption of Eddington-limit accretion. We find that the black hole masses for our high-redshift sample are approximately 1 - 2 orders of magnitude smaller than galaxies of comparable stellar mass in the local Universe. Although our estimates of black hole masses will increase if the accretion is sub-Eddington, and our stellar masses will decrease if we assume a much younger stellar population or a different initial mass function, we find that only through a combination of effects is it possible to shift the high redshift galaxies such that they lie on the local relation. This suggests that the black holes need to grow substantially between z= 2. 2 and the present-day, with much of the black hole growth occurring after the current <b>obscured,</b> far-infrared luminous <b>phase</b> of activity which is likely associated with the formation of the spheroid. This interpretation supports a scenario where SMGs pass through a subsequent accretion-dominated phase, where they would appear as optically bright quasars.

40|$|Sharan** Since time immemorial, Jharkhand {{region of}} Bihar {{happens to be}} the {{homeland}} of large number of people primarily tribals. Although the history of the area is obscure, it seems that various tribal groups came in the area, cleared the forest and settled in the valleys. They developed their own set of traditions and customs determining ownership, use and succession of land and common property resources. However, after living in relative isolation, the area has witnessed outside impositions since Mughal period. Each phase of history has brought new challenges and threats over the resources of these people, both individual and common property resources. The tribals in Jharkhand have a long history, both violent and non-violent protests in the area. The history of formal agrarian legislation bagan in the British period and each protest led to a new set of legislation in the area. The process continues till date. The present paper makes a modest attempt to discuss briefly the Agrarian legislation in the Jharkhand region of Bihar in a historical perspective namely in pre-British, British and post-Independence period. PRE-BRITISH PHASE Although the early history of the area is <b>obscure,</b> still certain <b>phases</b> in pre-British period has been identified (Tete. 1984).

40|$|Abstract. The {{interaction}} of Na atoms with a surface was probed by inserting a nanofabricated material grating into one arm of an atom interferometer (IFM). This technique permits a direct {{measurement of the}} change in phase and coherence of matter waves as they pass within 25 nm of the grating bar surface. The practical concerns and challenges of making such a measurement are discussed here. Interference of spurious diffraction orders, IFM path overlap, and the partial obscuration of IFM beams are all important aspects of this experiment. The systematic effects that contribute to the measured phase shift and contrast are discussed. Atomic diffraction from material grating structures [1] {{has been used as a}} tool to measure atom-surface interactions for noble gases [2] and alkali atoms [3, 4]. In these experiments the van der Waals (vdW) interaction [5] changed the relative intensities of the diffraction orders. More recently the atom wave phase shift Φ 0 induced by these grating structures 1 was measured directly using a sodium atom beam interferometer (IFM) [6]. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. An interaction grating (IG), comprised of an array of 50 nm wide channels, is inserted into one arm of the IFM. The vdW interaction between the sodium atoms and IG causes a phase shift of about Φ 0 ∼ 0. 3 radians. A number of systematic effects need to be understood before reporting this phase shift induced by the vdW interaction. This paper describes how the measured phase shift and contrast in [6] are influenced by these systematic effects and suggests some physical mechanisms for them. In general there is a non-trivial relationship between the measured phase shift Φmeas and induced phase shift Φ 0, when the IFM paths are partially <b>obscured</b> by a <b>phase</b> shifting element. Therefore, care should be taken when interpreting the phase shift data. This notion of partial obscuration is shown in Fig. 2, which illustrates how the interference pattern can have different phases in different regions of space. The detected interference signal can be written as the average flux transmitted through each grating window of G 3 in Fig. 1 S(θ) =...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, we {{have studied}} the {{thermodynamic}} stability of magnetic fluids, also called ferrofluids. These consist of spherical colloids of typically 10 nm, coated with a monolayer of oleic acid and dispersed in cyclohexane. The core material, Fe 3 O 4, is ferrimagnetic and because of its small size, the core consists of a single magnetic domain with a permanent magnetic moment. An easy preparation method for such colloids is described in chapter 2. The question how interactions between magnetic colloids affect the stability of magnetic fluids is one of practical as well as fundamental interest. Some applications require the magnetic fluid to remain monophasic under working conditions; others need phase separation of the magnetic fluid in order to work. To predict under which conditions a ferrofluid becomes unstable, it is often modeled as a dipolar hard sphere fluid (DHS fluid). Actually, theories for DHS fluids had been developed even before ferrofluids came up. Most of them aimed at describing the dielectric constant of polar liquids {{in terms of the}} properties of polar molecules. To assess the applicability of these theories on magnetic fluids, the magnetic susceptibility as a function of concentration and interaction strength of high quality ferrofluids has been studied in chapter 3. The variation of interaction strength was accomplished by separating a polydisperse ferrofluid into fractions with different mean particle sizes, ranging from 8 to 15 nm. None of the prevailing theories describes the measured susceptibilities accurately, although three theories (the Mean Spherical Model, Perturbation Theory and Onsager's theory) are in fair agreement with the experimental data. In chapter 4, two theories are described that are used to predict the stability of ferrofluids against liquid-gas phase separation. The theories show that phase separation in magnetic fluids may be induced by applying a magnetic field, if magnetic interactions between the colloids are sufficiently strong, about 3 kT. In ferrofluids, however, the interaction strength is only 1 kT, though due to polydispersity there will be a small fraction of large particles with much stronger interaction. Even though magnetic interactions alone may be too weak to enable phase separation in magnetic fluids, they will influence the stability of ferrofluids destabilized by other factors, for example by the presence of non-adsorbing polymer. Even without magnetic interactions, non-adsorbing polymer can induce colloidal gas-liquid phase separation in a colloidal dispersion. In chapter 4, a mean field theory for the phase behavior of colloid-polymer mixtures is extended to take magnetic interactions into account. Calculations with this modified theory show that magnetic interactions decrease the stability of colloid-polymer mixtures, and moreover, that the decrease in stability is stronger when a magnetic field is applied. As oleic acid can also be considered as a small polymer, removal of excess oleic acid, which is not always done after the synthesis of magnetic fluids, can improve the stability of magnetic fluids. In chapters 5 and 6, the stability of magnetic fluids containing poly(dimethylsiloxane), a non-adsorbing polymer, is studied experimentally. In chapter 5, it is set out in detail how phase separation is detected and quantified using a susceptibility meter based on a Colpitts oscillator. This instrument can make local measurements of the susceptibility in a sample tube; hence, the colloid concentration in each phase can be measured in a quick and non-destructive way. Moreover, the locations of phase boundaries and therefore the volumes of separate phases can be accurately determined. Chapter 5 also describes a method to obtain the polymer concentration in each separate phase by combining susceptibility measurements of samples with different colloid/polymer ratios. In principle, susceptibility measurements allow for the determination of the full phase diagram of colloid-polymer mixtures, including nodelines. In practice, however, translation of susceptibilities to concentrations was <b>obscured,</b> because <b>phase</b> separation is shown to be accompanied by strong size fractionation, and the susceptibility is very sensitive to changes in particle size. The influence of a magnetic field on the stability of ferrofluid-polymer mixtures is investigated in chapter 6, using the same susceptibility meter as used in chapter 5 and a thermostated electromagnet. Without polymer, the ferrofluid is stable at all attainable field strengths (up to 30 kAm - 1) and all concentrations. This is inconsistent with many reports in literature, but {{may be due to the}} fact that a high quality ferrofluid was used here, i. e. without excess oleic acid and clusters. With polymer, the phase behavior in a magnetic field clearly deviates from the behavior in zero field. The decrease in stability caused by the magnetic field is somewhat stronger that predicted by the theory described in chapter 4, but still of the same order of magnitude. An open question is how the stability is affected by the considerable polydispersity (26...|$|R
