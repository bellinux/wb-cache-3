30|$|By {{applying}} {{the idea of}} q-integers, the q-Bernstein operators were introduced by Lupaş [2] and later by Philip [3]. Since then, many authors introduced q-generalization of various operators and investigated several approximation properties. For instance, the q-analog of Stancu-Beta <b>operators</b> <b>in</b> [4] and [5]; the q-analog of Bernstein-Kantorovich <b>operators</b> <b>in</b> [6]; the q-Baskakov-Kantorovich <b>operators</b> <b>in</b> [7]; the q-Szász-Mirakjan <b>operators</b> <b>in</b> [8]; the q-Bleimann-Butzer-Hahn <b>operators</b> <b>in</b> [9] and in [10]; the q-analog of Baskakov and Baskakov-Kantorovich <b>operators</b> <b>in</b> [11]; the q-analog of Szász-Kantorovich <b>operators</b> <b>in</b> [12]; and the q-analog of generalized Bernstein-Schurer <b>operators</b> <b>in</b> [13].

5|$|Muni began {{service on}} December 28, 1912, when the A Geary-Park line was inaugurated, running between the Financial District and the Richmond District {{on the western}} side of the city. Expansion of the system and {{consolidation}} with other transit companies eventually made Muni the city's sole public transit <b>operator</b> <b>in</b> 1952, when it acquired the bankrupt California Street Cable Railroad. Subsequent changes and adjustments to the system gave rise to the lines in use today.|$|E

5|$|By 1987 Pittston Coal {{had dropped}} {{from being the}} seventh largest coal <b>operator</b> <b>in</b> the United States to the 15th, and coal {{production}} was at an all-time low. The Pittston Coal Company had worked with the Bituminous Coal Operators (BCOA), which regulated health and retirement benefits offered to Pittston workers. The Pittston mines continued to lose money, though, and in 1987 the Pittston Coal Company terminated its contract with the BCOA to establish its own health and retirement benefit contract with the UMWA. Through collective bargaining, the UMWA and the Pittston Coal Company established two different retirement plans for the miners: one for those who retired before 1974 and one for those who retired after 1974, {{in the hopes that}} this would help the company gain a profit.|$|E
5|$|Carl Eric Wickman {{was born}} in Sweden in 1887.

In the same year, he became a Hupmobile {{salesman}} in Hibbing, Minnesota. He proved unable to sell the car. In 1914, using his remaining vehicle, a 7-passenger car, he began a bus service with Andy (Bus Andy) Anderson and C.A.A. (Arvid) Heed, by transporting iron ore miners from Hibbing to Alice (known for its saloons) at 15 cents a ride.|$|E

The Norwegian National Rail Administration bought one unit (628) for maintenance, and has painted it yellow. The Norwegian Railway Museum in Hamar has {{preserved}} three units, of which two (602 and 616) were operated by GM-Gruppen and one (615) is kept for spare parts. NSB has kept one unit as reserve at Ål Station. The remaining units have been scrapped, put aside or sold as spare part units.|$|E
5|$|From December 1978 to May 1980, Braniff International Airways leased 11 Concordes, five from Air France and six from British Airways. These {{were used}} on subsonic flights between Dallas-Fort Worth and Washington Dulles International Airport, flown by Braniff flight crews. Air France and British Airways crews then took {{over for the}} {{continuing}} supersonic flights to London and Paris. The aircraft were registered in both the United States and their home countries; the European registration was covered while being operated by Braniff, retaining full AF/BA liveries. The flights were not profitable and typically less than 50% booked, forcing Braniff to end its tenure as the only US Concorde <b>operator</b> <b>in</b> May 1980.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 the Kennett Government offered long-distance country rail {{services}} previously {{run by the}} government-owned operator V/Line {{to private}} operators. While several rail services were replaced by road coach services, West Coast Railway successfully tendered to operate the railway line to Warrnambool, becoming the first private <b>operator</b> <b>in</b> Victoria. In 1993 Professor Fred Hilmer presented {{the findings of the}} National Competition Policy Review Committee, known as the Hilmer Report, leading to the introduction of National Competition Policy in 1995. This allowed new rail freight operators to establish operations in Victoria. Specialised Container Transport commenced operating trains to Perth in 1995, and Great Northern Rail Services started intrastate operations.|$|E

After leaving school, in 1950, he joined the United States Air Force for eight to nine months.|$|E
5|$|Officials {{proposed}} dockless bike sharing for the Citi Bike network, {{which would}} allow bikes to be rented without being tethered to docks. This was proposed after several bike sharing companies announced their intent to operate in New York City. In early August, the dockless bike-sharing company Spin had started a dockless operation in the Rockaways, but {{had been told to}} cease and desist operations by the NYCDOT, which had licensed Citi Bike as the only official bike-share <b>operator</b> <b>in</b> New York City. By the end of the month, Citi Bike started designing a dockless prototype that could still lock its own wheels based on whether the customer had paid. Meanwhile, Spin—a viable competitor to Citi Bike with lower per-half-hour pricing—was still looking to get a permit to start operations in New York City.|$|E

He grew up in the {{adjacent}} city of Zuffenhausen, now also a part of Stuttgart. After finishing school in spring 1913, he started work as a press <b>operator</b> <b>in</b> a shoe factory. In November 1913 he changed his employer and moved to the Bosch factory works in Feuerbach. There he completed his training as metal presser and remained until autumn 1920, with interruptions due to war service during 1917-1918 and the subsequent German Revolution of 1918-1919.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) has {{operated}} forty-eight Lockheed C-130 Hercules transport aircraft. The type entered Australian service in December 1958, when No.36 Squadron accepted {{the first of}} twelve C-130As, replacing its venerable Douglas C-47 Dakotas. The acquisition made Australia the first operator of the Hercules after the United States. In 1966 the C-130As were joined by twelve C-130Es, which equipped No.37 Squadron. The C-130As were replaced by twelve C-130Hs in 1978, and the C-130Es by twelve C-130J Super Hercules in 1999. No.37 Squadron became the RAAF's sole Hercules <b>operator</b> <b>in</b> 2006, when No.36 Squadron transferred its C-130Hs prior to converting to Boeing C-17 GlobemasterIII heavy transports. The C-130Hs were retired in November 2012, leaving the C-130J as the only model in Australian service.|$|E
5|$|The {{alliance}} {{celebrated its}} first anniversary in August 2016 {{with a new}} joint operations center and continued growth in traffic, despite a drop in shipping caused by slower growth in Asia. Later that month, Hanjin Shipping, a major <b>operator</b> <b>in</b> Seattle, filed for bankruptcy and was barred from the Port of Seattle over fears of unpaid terminal fees. The bankruptcy sent the global shipping industry into a panic, with several Hanjin ships anchored off the Pacific coast awaiting approval to unload cargo. In December, Hanjin's Terminal 46 in Seattle was sold to an affiliate of Mediterranean Shipping Company for $78 million; the move was opposed by the Port of Seattle, who filed a request to block the sale over a lack of correspondence about the new lease and security deposit.|$|E
