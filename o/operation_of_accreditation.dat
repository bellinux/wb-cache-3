(IAF) details {{criteria}} for the <b>accreditation</b> <b>of</b> bodies that provide conformity assessment services, and such accreditation facilitates trade and reduces demands for multiple conformity assessment activities. Accreditation reduces risk for business and its customers by assuring that accredited Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs) are competent {{to carry out the}} work they undertake within their scope <b>of</b> <b>accreditation.</b> Accreditation Bodies (ABs) that are members of IAF and the CABs they accredit are required to comply with appropriate international standards and the applicable IAF application documents for the consistent application of those standards. ABs that are signatories to the IAF Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) are evaluated regularly by an appointed team of peers to provide confidence in the <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> their <b>accreditation</b> programs. The structure and scope of the IAF MLA is detailed in IAF PR 4 - Structure of IAF MLA and Endorsed Normative Documents. The IAF MLA is structured in five levels: Level 1 specifies mandatory criteria that apply to all ABs, ISO/IEC 17011. The combination of a Level 2 activity(ies) and th...|$|R
40|$|Background: Professional {{accreditation}} is an importation {{measure for}} higher education quality assurance as it helps analyze and {{enhance the quality of}} education within nursing programs. Current literature indicates that accreditation is largely determined by national and regional institutions and lacks coherent international academic standards which causes a lack of consistency in nurse education around the world. Objectives: The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze the policy, standards and <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> professional <b>accreditation</b> amongst a sample of countries and regions around the world. It explores the strategies and improvement measures <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> and provides a useful reference for nursing education <b>accreditation</b> in terms <b>of</b> the <b>operation</b> and reformation <b>of</b> nurse education standards. Methodology: The study combined quantitative and qualitative methods through the search of websites and electronic data bases and the consultation of experts. The sources were 2 organizations, 5 countries, and 2 regions. Medical, health and nursing related databases such as CINAHL Plus, EBSCO MEDLINE, Journals@Ovid were utilized. In addition, four experts from the United States, the United Kingdom, Mainland China and Hong Kong were consulted and a case study from Macau was used to illustrate and share experience. The updated literature, related documents and expert feedback were analyzed. Results: The results indicated that the procedures and requirements for professional accreditation were similar, but were generally non-mandatory. There were differences in frequency, form and focus, and there were also variations amongst accrediting bodies, in term of terminology, jargon used as well as assessment indicators and standards. Conclusions and Recommendations: There were differences and variations between countries and regions regarding accreditation, according to their conditions and context. Practice could vary but the focus and core standards tended to be consistent. In order to promote more consistency in nurse education in the future, a strategy for accreditation should consider: 1. establishing mutual recognition <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> systems; 2. developing an international accreditation system; 3. recruiting international external examiners and experts to oversee standards; 4. the ICN to develop international accreditation services...|$|R

40|$|Background: Accreditation {{has become}} {{ubiquitous}} across the international health care landscape. Award <b>of</b> full <b>accreditation</b> status {{in health care}} is viewed, {{as it is in}} other sectors, as a valid indicator of high quality organisational performance. However, few studies have empirically demonstrated this assertion. The value <b>of</b> <b>accreditation,</b> therefore, remains uncertain, and this persists as a central legitimacy problem for accreditation providers, policymakers and researchers. The question arises as to how best to research the validity, impact and value <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> processes in health care. Most health care organisations participate in some sort <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> process and thus {{it is not possible to}} study its merits using a randomised controlled strategy. Further, tools and processes for accreditation and organisational performance are multifaceted. Methods/design: To understand the relationship between them a multi-method research approach is required which incorporates both quantitative and qualitative data. The generic nature <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> standard development and inspection within different sectors enhances the extent to which the findings of in-depth study <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> process in one industry can be generalised to other industries. This paper presents a research design which comprises a prospective, multi-method, multi-level, multi-disciplinary approach to assess the validity, impact and value <b>of</b> <b>accreditation.</b> Discussion: The accreditation program which assesses over 1, 000 health services in Australia is used as an exemplar for testing this design. The paper proposes this design as a framework suitable for application to future international research into accreditation. Our aim is to stimulate debate on the role <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> and how to research it. 10 page(s...|$|R
