In the same manner estimates {{for the number of}} Ido speakers are far from accurate, but 500 to a few thousand is most likely. It is also important to note the distinction between the number of speakers compared to the number of supporters; the two languages resemble each other enough that a few weeks of study will enable one to understand the other with little difficulty, {{and there are a number}} <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> learned Ido out of curiosity but prefer to support the larger Esperanto movement and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|One common group <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> {{visual memory}} {{problems}} are children with reading disabilities. It was often thought that disabilities {{are caused by}} failure to perceive the letters of a written word in the right order. However, studies show {{it is more likely}} that it is caused by a failure to encode and process the correct order of letters within the word. This means that the child perceives the word just as anyone else would, however their brains do not appear to hold onto the visual characteristics of the word. Although initially it was found that children with reading disabilities had comparable visual memory to those without difficulty, a more specific part of the visual memory system has been found to cause reading disabilities.|$|E

Although both abroad and at home his policy had generally embodied {{the wishes of the}} ascendant party in the state, Danby had never obtained the confidence of the nation. His character inspired no respect, and during the whole of his long career, he could not rely on the support of a single individual. Charles is said to have told him when he made him treasurer that he had only two friends in the world, himself and his own merit. He was described to Samuel Pepys as [...] "one of a broken sort <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> not much to lose and therefore will venture all", and as [...] "a beggar having £1100 or £1200 a year, but owes above £10,000". His office brought him in £20,000 a year, and he was known to make large profits by the sale of offices; he maintained his power by corruption and by jealously excluding from office men of high standing and ability. Gilbert Burnet described him as [...] "the most hated minister that had ever been about the king".|$|E
