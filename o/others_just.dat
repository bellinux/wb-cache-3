Inscriptions mention guilds of weavers, oilmen, artisans, basket and mat makers and fruit sellers. A Saundatti inscription refers to an assemblage {{of all the people}} of a district headed by the guilds of the region. Some guilds were considered superior to <b>others,</b> <b>just</b> as some corporations were, and received royal charters determining their powers and privileges. Inscriptions suggest these guilds had their own militia to protect goods in transit and, like village assemblies, they operated banks that lent money to traders and businesses.|$|E

25|$|Males {{of certain}} species have evolved mating {{behaviors}} {{in which they}} forcefully attempt to mate with and inseminate females, often employing grasping techniques. These male grasping devices exist to increase the duration of copulation and restrict females from mating with other males. They are in some ways a form of mate guarding. While some males have evolved different types of modifications to aid in grasping, <b>others</b> <b>just</b> grab females and attempt to force copulation.|$|E
25|$|Some {{writers in}} their manner and stance {{intentionally}} provoke challenge and criticism from their readers. <b>Others</b> <b>just</b> {{invite you to}} think. Baudrillard's hyperprose demands only that you grunt wide-eyed or bewildered assent. He yearns to have intellectual influence, but must fend off any serious analysis of his own writing, remaining free to leap from one bombastic assertion to the next, no matter how brazen. Your place is simply to buy his books, adopt his jargon, and drop his name wherever possible.|$|E
25|$|Vishnu is a Vedic deity, {{but not a}} {{prominent}} one when compared to Indra, Agni and <b>others.</b> <b>Just</b> 5 out of 1028 hymns of the Rigveda, a 2nd millennium BCE Hindu text, are dedicated to Vishnu, and he finds minor mention in the other hymns. Vishnu is mentioned in the Brahmana layer of text in the Vedas, thereafter his profile rises and over the history of Indian mythology, states Jan Gonda, Vishnu becomes a divinity of the highest rank, one equivalent to the Supreme Being.|$|E

Some gave away furniture and belongings, some gave it to someone for safe storage, others simply walked away, leaving dirty {{dishes in the sink}} and food on the table. The withdrawal of cash from banks was limited to £20 per person. People could take just one suitcase.|$|E
25|$|There are 112 {{buildings}} in this 17-acre (7 ha) area. Only two {{are not considered}} contributing properties to the district's historic character. Many of the buildings are rowhouses in the Federal and Greek Revival styles. They do not fully cover their lots, leaving {{a considerable amount of}} open space in the district. Some of it is taken up by off-street parking, some of it is left undeveloped as lawns and parks, and a tennis court has been built on John Street between Franklin and Green (complemented by two <b>others</b> <b>just</b> outside the district).|$|E
25|$|On June 9, 2016, a {{transformer}} exploded near the park which caused a power {{cut to the}} park.

No riders were injured, although some waited over an hour before they were evacuated by park personnel. The park was scheduled to open normally the following day, but with some affected rides closed.|$|E

After Dazzler infects Medusa, Minoru casts a spell to transform Alice {{back into a}} human {{but it does not}} cure the rest of the populace. Alice explains that she must be killed and Minoru reluctantly casts a death spell on Alice which transforms the infected back into humans. Alice then remerges in her final form and tells A-Force that she is no longer a threat as she now has greater control of her powers. When the commotion is over, Danvers and Minoru continue to disagree over each other's actions but agree to visit She-Hulk together in the hospital.|$|E
25|$|Exodus says {{each day}} one omer of manna was {{gathered}} per family member (about 3.64 litres), and may imply this was {{regardless of how}} much effort was put into gathering it; a midrash attributed to Rabbi Tanhuma remarks that although some were diligent enough {{to go into the}} fields to gather manna, <b>others</b> <b>just</b> lay down lazily and caught it with their outstretched hands. The Talmud states that this factor was used to solve disputes about the ownership of slaves, since the number of omers of manna each household could gather would indicate how many people were legitimately part of the household; the omers of manna for stolen slaves could be gathered only by legitimate owners, and therefore legitimate owners would have spare omers of manna.|$|E
25|$|In India, on Hindu fasting days (Navaratri, Ekadashi, Janmashtami, Maha Shivaratri etc.), fasting {{people in}} {{northern}} states of India eat items made of buckwheat flour. Eating cereals such as wheat or rice is prohibited during such fasting days. However, since buckwheat {{is not a}} cereal, it is considered acceptable for consumption during Hindu fasting days. While strict Hindus do not even drink water during their fast (observing Nirjal Upwas), <b>others</b> <b>just</b> give up cereals and salt and take a meal prepared from non-cereal ingredients such as buckwheat (kuttu). The preparation of buckwheat flour varies across India. The famous ones are kuttu ki puri (buckwheat pancakes) and kuttu pakoras (potato slices dipped in buckwheat flour and deep-fried in oil). In most of northern and western states, buckwheat flour is called kuttu ka atta.|$|E

25|$|Look, if I have a {{triangle}} in midfield – Claude Makélélé behind and two <b>others</b> <b>just</b> in front – I {{will always have}} an advantage against a pure 4–4–2 where the central midfielders are side by side. That's because I will always have an extra man. It starts with Makélélé, who is between the lines. If nobody comes to him {{he can see the}} whole pitch and has time. If he gets closed down it means one of the two other central midfielders is open. If they are closed down and the other team's wingers come inside to help, it means there is space now for us on the flank, either for our own wingers or for our full-backs. There is nothing a pure 4–4–2 can do to stop things.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} large classes of locomotive, {{there were some}} {{variations}} during the Class 24s' lifetime, some affecting all of the class (nominally), and <b>others</b> <b>just</b> individual locos. One such locomotive was 24133, {{one of the last}} survivors of the class and easily recognised as it had different headcode boxes on each end, the standard one for the class at one end and that at the other end matching those used on the Class 27. This was not unique, as 24145 had a headcode box similar to those fitted to later batches of Class 25s. In each case, this is likely to be due to collision damage repairs. Some Inverness-based locomotives had 'car lights' fitted to each nose. These were after-market car headlamps mounted in the plated-over nose doors, to provide extra visibility to users of level crossings on sharply curved branch lines. D5114-132 had pairs mounted in each nose. These were removed between 1975/6, with small plates welded over the apertures. 12 Class 26s had similar modifications, some having pairs and others having a single lamp. Examples of Class 37s, Class 47s and a solitary Class 86 had single railway spotlights installed at each end but the Class 24s and Class 26s were the only ones fitted with proper car headlamps.|$|E

In the slalom, Nkrumah-Acheampong registered times of 1:09:08 and 1:13:52 in his two runs, resulting in a final position of 47th overall. This was one place behind Azzimani of Morocco.|$|E
