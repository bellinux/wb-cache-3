500|$|Months {{before the}} Army's private {{correspondence}} {{with the church}} group, Associated Press reporters, researching those same 1950 <b>operational</b> <b>records,</b> found orders to shoot South Korean civilians. The U.S.-based news agency, which reported {{the rejection of the}} survivors' claim in April 1998, had begun investigating the No Gun Ri allegations earlier that year, trying to identify Army units possibly involved, and to track down their ex-soldiers. On September 29, 1999, after a year of internal struggle over releasing the article, the AP published its investigative report on the massacre, based on the accounts of 24 No Gun Ri survivors, corroborated by a dozen 7th Cavalry Regiment veterans. [...] "We just annihilated them," [...] it quoted former 7th Cavalry machine gunner Norman Tinkler as saying. The journalists' research into declassified military documents at the U.S. National Archives uncovered recorded instructions in late July 1950 that front-line units shoot South Korean refugees approaching their positions. A liaison officer of the sister 8th Cavalry Regiment had relayed word to his unit from 1st Cavalry Division headquarters to fire on refugees trying to cross U.S. front lines. Major General [...] William B. Kean of the neighboring 25th Infantry Division advised that any civilians found in areas supposed to be cleared by police should be considered enemies and [...] "treated accordingly," [...] an order relayed by his staff as [...] "considered as unfriendly and shot." [...] On the day the No Gun Ri killings began, the Eighth Army ordered all units to stop refugees from crossing their lines.|$|E

40|$|Imagire-guchi inlet is a 200 m wide channel with jetties {{between the}} Pacific Ocean and Hamana Lake, Japan. An ebb-tidal delta (ETD) at the shoreface is {{enlarged}} by strong offshore-going currents through the channel. In this study, bathymetric data is obtained frequently from <b>operational</b> <b>record</b> (the position by GPS {{and the depth}} by fishfinder) of small fishing boats in the nearshore area. Comparison of the frequent monitoring data from 2007 to 2012 shows that medium-term trends of ETD progradation and short-term topographical changes on ETD. Annual rate of the prograding according to analysis of ETD terminal slope (depth of 9 - 11 m) resulted in 7 - 9 m/year seaward until June 2011. Bathymetric change analysis shows that concentrated erosion (approximately 2 m vertically) occurred within ETD by effect of high wave condition due to a strong typhoon passed in July 2011. The erosion zone trapped sediment supply. As a result, balance between sediment supply and demand for constant ETD progradation was lost, and angle of ETD terminal slope and volume of sediment composing ETD decreased. The results emphasized that frequent bathymetric data obtained with the <b>operational</b> <b>record</b> give us efficient method for monitoring ETD formation and sediment transport. This method has applicability in various time-scale monitoring for bathymetric analysis...|$|R
