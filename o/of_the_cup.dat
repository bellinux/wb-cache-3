5|$|The Stanley Cup {{championship}} team is allotted 100 days during off-season to pass around the Cup including the team's parade, days with sponsors {{and a day}} or so with each player and member of the team's staff. It is always accompanied by at least one representative from the Hockey Hall of Fame. Although many players have unofficially spent a day in personal possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cup,</b> in 1994 the New York Rangers started a tradition wherein each member of the Cup-winning team is allowed to retain the Cup for a day. Victors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cup</b> have used it to baptize their children. Three players (the New York Islanders' Clark Gillies, the Anaheim Ducks' Sean O'Donnell, and the Pittsburgh Penguins' Nick Bonino) even allowed their dogs to eat out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cup.</b>|$|E

5|$|When a {{raindrop}} {{hits the}} interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> {{with the proper}} angle and velocity it can produce considerable force, and can create a splash that drives the water up along the sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> (also known as splash cups), tearing the funiculus, and ejecting the peridioles. The peridioles are followed by their funicular cord and basal hapteron. When they hit a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered {{by the force of}} the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridiole, attached to the plant, may be eaten by herbivorous mammals, and the subsequent passage through its digestive tract will soften the hard shell enough to facilitate later sporulation.|$|E
