5|$|On 30 December 1947, {{members of}} the Irgun, a Jewish {{underground}} militia, threw bombs into a crowd of Arabs outside {{the gates of the}} Consolidated Refineries in Haifa, killing six and injuring 42. In response Arab employees of the company killed 39 Jewish employees in {{what became known as the}} Haifa <b>Oil</b> <b>Refinery</b> massacre. The Jewish Haganah militia retaliated with a raid on the Arab village of Balad al-Shaykh, where many of the Arab refinery workers lived, in what became known as the Balad al-Shaykh massacre. Control of Haifa was critical in the ensuing civil war, since it was the major industrial and <b>oil</b> <b>refinery</b> port in British Palestine.|$|E

5|$|In Venezuela, {{citizens}} in coastal areas of Falcón, Sucre and Isla Margarita {{were moved to}} safer areas, and several thousands were evacuated due to the hurricane. The Simón Bolívar International Airport, as well as three other mainland airports, were closed. Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. temporarily closed its <b>oil</b> <b>refinery</b> in Curaçao, and two ports were briefly shut down; this caused a delay in two oil deliveries. The Valero Energy Corporation shut down its largest <b>oil</b> <b>refinery</b> in Aruba. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the hurricane, oil companies in Trinidad and Tobago ceased production and removed workers from offshore rigs; the Atlantic LNG company closed exports. Seven shelters were opened on Tobago, where about 560people evacuated for the storm. Two people died: one man trying to save his car, and one girl sleeping in her bed, when a tree fell on the roof above her room. Most evacuees were from low-lying areas, and {{on the day of the}} storm's passage most schools and businesses were closed. The two main airports in the country were closed, with one airline canceling all of its flights.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} posed {{a threat}} to all of Bandar Abbas' oil companies, {{as well as at}} least one highly productive and expensive refinery {{at the time of the}} earthquake. Because of past earthquakes, including one in 2006, many of the city's homes had been rebuilt and outfitted with seismically engineered designs. The major <b>oil</b> <b>refinery</b> did not sustain damage, according to Hojjatollah Ghanimifard, the vice-president of investment affairs for National Iranian Oil Company.|$|E

5|$|From late June the 315thBombardment Wing {{conducted}} {{a series of}} night precision bombing attacks against the Japanese oil industry, independently of the precision day and night incendiary raids. The wing's B-29s were fitted with the advanced AN/APQ-7 radar that allowed targets to be accurately located at night. Arriving in the Marianas in April 1945, the 315th underwent a period of operational training before flying its first attack against the Utsube <b>Oil</b> <b>Refinery</b> at Yokkaichi on the night of 26June. The 30 bombers (out of 38 dispatched) that struck the refinery destroyed or damaged 30percent of the facility. The unit's next attack was against a refinery at Kudamatsu three nights later, and on the night of 2July it struck another refinery at Minoshima. On the night of 6/7July the 315thBombardment Wing destroyed the Maruzen <b>oil</b> <b>refinery</b> near Osaka, and three nights later it completed the destruction of the Utsube refinery. The wing had conducted 15 operations against Japanese oil facilities {{by the end of the}} war. During these attacks it destroyed six of the nine targets attacked for the loss of four B-29s. However, as Japan had almost no crude oil to refine due to the Allied naval blockade of the home islands these raids had little impact on the country's war effort.|$|E

5|$|Douglas Trumbull was {{the visual}} effects supervisor, while Carlo Rambaldi {{designed}} the aliens. Trumbull joked that the visual effects budget, at $3.3million, {{could have been}} used to produce an additional film. His work helped lead to advances in motion control photography. The mother ship was designed by Ralph McQuarrie and built by Greg Jein. The look of the ship was inspired by an <b>oil</b> <b>refinery</b> Spielberg saw at night in India. Instead of the metallic hardware look used in Star Wars, the emphasis was on a more luminescent look for the UFOs. One of the UFO models was an oxygen mask with lights attached to it, used because of its irregular shape. As a subtle in-joke, Dennis Muren (who had just finished working on Star Wars) put a small R2-D2 model onto the underside of the mothership. The model of the mothership is now on display in the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy Annex at Washington Dulles Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.|$|E
