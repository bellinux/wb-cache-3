40|$|One of {{the cell}} types first {{encountered}} by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) following sexual transmission are dendritic cells (DC). DC capture HIV- 1 through C-type lectin receptors, of which the best studied example is DC-SIGN, which mediates HIV- 1 internalization. DC can keep the virus infectious for several days {{and are able to}} transmit HIV- 1 to CD 4 (+) T cells. We tested proteins from milk and serum for their ability to block DC-mediated HIV- 1 transmission, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoferrin</b> (bLF) is the most potent inhibitor. bLF binds strongly to DC-SIGN, thus preventing virus capture and subsequent transmission. Interestingly, bLF is a much more efficient inhibitor of transmission than human lactoferrin. Since bLF is nontoxic and easy to purify in large quantities, it is an interesting candidate microbicide against HIV- 1. Another advantage of bLF is its ability to block HIV- 1 replication in T cells. DC-mediated capture of a bLF-resistant HIV- 1 variant that was selected during long-term culturing in T cells could still be blocked by bLF. This underscores the usefulness of bLF as a microbicide drug to prevent HIV- 1 transmissio...|$|E

40|$|Although the {{antimicrobial}} {{activity of}} lactoferrin {{has been well}} described, its mechanism of action has been poorly characterized. Recent work has indicated {{that in addition to}} binding iron, human lactoferrin damages the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. In this study, we determined whether <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoferrin</b> and a pepsin-derived <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoferrin</b> peptide (lactoferricin) fragment have similar activities. We found that both 20 microM <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoferrin</b> and 20 microM lactoferricin release intrinsically labeled [3 H]lipopolysaccharide ([3 H]LPS) from three bacterial strains, Escherichia coli CL 99 1 - 2, Salmonella typhimurium SL 696, and Salmonella montevideo SL 5222. Under most conditions, more LPS is released by the peptide fragment than by whole <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoferrin.</b> In the presence of either lactoferrin or lactoferricin there is increased killing of E. coli CL 99 1 - 2 by lysozyme. Like human <b>lactoferrin,</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoferrin</b> and lactoferricin have the ability to bind to free intrinsically labeled [3 H]LPS molecules. In addition to these effects, whereas <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoferrin</b> was at most bacteriostatic, lactoferricin demonstrated consistent bactericidal activity against gram-negative bacteria. This bactericidal effect is modulated by the cations Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, and Fe 3 + but is independent of the osmolarity of the medium. Transmission electron microscopy of bacterial cells exposed to lactoferricin show the immediate development of electron-dense "membrane blisters. " These experiments offer evidence that <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoferrin</b> and lactoferricin damage the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, the peptide fragment lactoferricin has direct bactericidal activity.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effects of the}} probiotic bacterium, L. reuteri DPC 16, alone and in combination with <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoferrin,</b> on intestinal pathogens, intestinal inflammation and carcinogenesis. Human and animal cellular model systems were designed and applied to this evaluation. The identity of the L. reuteri DPC 16 strain was confirmed using 16 S rRNA analysis and its ability to produce the antibacterial compound, reuterin. It was able to tolerate pH 2 and physiological concentrations of bile salts in a simulated gastrointestinal tract environment in the presence of protective nutrients. It was able to adhere to a Caco- 2 human epithelial monolayer (modelling the human GI tract) and it did not degrade mucin. Both <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoferrin</b> and L. reuteri DPC 16 inhibited the growth of the intestinal pathogens Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, with much less effect on tested probiotic bacteria. Together, L. reuteri DPC 16 and <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoferrin</b> showed synergistic inhibitory effects. L. reuteri DPC 16 was also able to remove indole from faecal water. Using human/animal cellular model systems, combined with the use of E. coli endotoxin and genotoxic factors present in faecal water, <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoferrin</b> was shown to down-regulate inflammation by affecting the signalling pathway on immune receptors that recognize the endotoxin, while both <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoferrin</b> and strain DPC 16 were shown to have the potential to prevent epithelial cell DNA damage.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{evaluated}} the ability of lactoferrin, the most abundant antimicrobial protein in airway secretions, to bind the surface structures of a Burkholderia strain cystic fibrosis-isolated. Burkholderia cenocepacia is a gram-negative bacterium involved as respiratory pathogen in cystic fibrosis patient infections. This bacterium possesses filamentous structures, named cable pili that have been proposed as virulence factors because {{of their ability to}} bind to respiratory epithelia and mucin. Previously, we demonstrated that <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoferrin</b> was able to influence the efficiency of invasion of different iron-regulated morphological forms of B. cenocepacia. <b>Bovine</b> <b>lactoferrin</b> showed to efficiently inhibit invasion of alveolar epithelial cells by free-living bacteria or iron-induced aggregates or biofilm. Results of the present study demonstrate that <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoferrin</b> is also able to specifically bind to B. cenocepacia cells and show that cable pili are involved in this interaction. The attachment of <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoferrin</b> to pili led to a reduced binding of bacterial cells to mucin.

Lactoferrin {{has been known}} as a multifunctional protein and its antimicrobial effect {{is one of the}} most essential function of it. In order to compare their susceptibilities against lactoferrin, the minimal inhibitory concentration values were estimated by a microplate assay method using 96 -well microplate, which involved measuring the optical density of the cultures. Prototheca zopfii was highly sensitive to <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoferrin</b> and complete inhibition of this microorganism was observed even at the low concentration of 7 μg/ml. On the other hand, E. coli and enterococci showed resistance against lactoferrin action and staphylococci showed strain-dependent resistance. 臨床型乳房炎乳からE. coli（ 11 株），K. pneumoniae（ 5 株），enterococci（ 8 株）， S. aureus（ 10 株），CNS（ 13 株），streptococci（ 11 株），P. zopfii（ 7 株），yeast-like fungi（ 9 株）を分離し，ラクトフェリンに対する感受性を比較した．その結果，P. zopfiiがラクトフェリンによって最も増殖抑制を受け易かった．一方，E. coliやenterococciはラクトフェリンの影響を受けにくく，またS. aureusは菌株によって感受性の有無が分かれた...|$|R
40|$|Lactoferrin, an 80 kDa bi-globular iron-binding {{glycoprotein}} {{belonging to}} the transferrin family, is a pleiotropic factor with potent antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, present in breast milk, in mucosal secretions, and in the secondary granules of neutrophils. Recently, we have shown that <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoferrin</b> prevents the early phases of echovirus infection and also acts as a survival factor inhibiting viral-induced apoptosis. In the present research we investigated the mechanism of <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoferrin</b> anti-echoviral effect demonstrating that echovirus enters susceptible cells by an endocytic pathway and that lactoferrin treatment is able to prevent viral genome delivery into the cytoplasm. It is likely that lactoferrin interaction with echovirus capsid proteins induces alterations that stabilize the conformation of the virion making it resistant to uncoating. w Taken together, {{the results of our}} study show that the inhibition of echovirus 6 infectivity by lactoferrin is dependent on its interaction not only with cell surface glycosaminoglycan chains but also with viral structural proteins demonstrating that this glycoprotein targets the virus entry process.

40|$|Listeria monocytogenes, an {{intracellular}} facultative food-borne pathogen, {{was reported}} to induce apoptosis in vitro and in vivo {{in a variety of}} cell types with the exception of murine macrophages. These cells represent the predominant compartment of bacterial multiplication and die as a result of necrosis. In this study we showed that human non-activated and IFN-γ-activated macrophagic-like (THP- 1) cells infected with L. monocytogenes, mainly die by necrosis rather than by an apoptotic process. Two natural products derived from <b>bovine</b> milk, <b>lactoferrin</b> and its derivative peptide lactoferricin B, are capable of regulating the fate of infected human macrophages. <b>Bovine</b> <b>lactoferrin</b> treatment of macrophages protects them from L. monocytogenes-induced death whereas lactoferricin B, its derivative peptide, determines a shifting of the equilibrium from necrosis to apoptosis...|$|R
