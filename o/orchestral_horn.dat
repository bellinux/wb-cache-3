The bore of the Vienna horn is also smaller than more modern horns—actually very close to that of the valveless natural horn. The Vienna horn has remained virtually unchanged since the mid-nineteenth century—as a result it is arguably well-suited to the Classical and Romantic repertoire at the core of the VPO's programming.|$|R

Horn music makes greater use of the higher range of the harmonic series than do most other modern brass instruments.|$|E

The tenor horn has also been used in concert bands as a replacement for the French horn. In the past, many publishers included parts in both Eb (for the tenor horn) and F (for the French horn). These parts were the same, just transposed into the pitch of the given instrument. Some publishers still follow this practice.|$|E

5000|$|The early public {{performances}} {{would have}} been made using the valved F single horn, which was indicated in the score in later editions (although the <b>orchestral</b> <b>horns</b> were still specified as E-flat natural horns). In practice, all of the modern performances and recordings are played on the valved F double-horn which was developed {{at the end of}} the 19th Century. When the concerto was written, the use of natural horns was still common. For example, Brahms continued to write for natural horns in his symphonies (symphony 3 is contemporary with the horn concerto) because he deemed the sound better. Strauss himself went on to fully exploit the possibilities of the valved horn in his tone poems starting with Don Juan, written just a few years later.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Orchestral</b> <b>horns</b> are {{traditionally}} grouped into [...] "high" [...] horn and [...] "low" [...] horn pairs. Players specialize {{to negotiate the}} unusually wide range required of the instrument. Formerly, in certain situations, composers called for two pairs of horns in two different keys. For example, a composer might call for two horns in C and two in E for a piece in C minor, {{in order to gain}} harmonics of the relative major unavailable on the C horns. Eventually, two pairs of horns became the standard, and from this tradition of two independent pairs, each with its own [...] "high" [...] and [...] "low" [...] horn, came the modern convention of writing both the first and third parts above the second and fourth.|$|R
5000|$|As {{they are}} pitched in F or G and their range {{overlaps}} {{that of the}} horn, mellophones {{can be used in}} place of the horn in brass and marching band settings. Mellophones are, however, sometimes unpopular with horn players because the mouthpiece change can be difficult and requires a different embouchure. Because the bore is more cylindrical than the <b>orchestral</b> <b>horn</b> the [...] "feel" [...] of the mellophone can be foreign to a horn player. Another unfamiliar aspect of the mellophone is that it is designed to be played with the right hand instead of the left (although it can be played with the left). Intonation can also be an issue when playing the mellophone.|$|E

5000|$|The German horn is {{the most}} common type of <b>orchestral</b> <b>horn,</b> and is ordinarily known simply as the [...] "horn". The double horn in F/B♭ is the version most used by {{professional}} bands and orchestras. A musician who plays the German horn is called a horn player (or, less frequently, a hornist). Pitch is controlled through the adjustment of lip tension in the mouthpiece and the operation of valves by the left hand, which route the air into extra tubing. German horns have lever-operated rotary valves. The backward-facing orientation of the bell relates to the perceived desirability to create a subdued sound, in concert situations, in contrast to the more-piercing quality of the trumpet.|$|E

5000|$|Around 1800 in France {{terminal}} crooks were invented, {{which proved}} to be extremely popular. These instruments used a separate crook for each key, and the crooks maintained a fairly uniform distance between the mouthpiece and {{the body of the}} instrument. Horn players typically needed at least eight crooks, for B-alto, A, G, F, E, E, D, and C. After about 1828, an additional crook in A-alto was also included. Although crooks for low B and B were also occasionally made, these keys were usually reached by adding couplers to the C crook. Horns constructed with the large number of crooks needed for playing in an orchestra are sometimes referred to as <b>orchestral</b> <b>horns</b> ("Orchesterhorn" [...] in German). The main disadvantage of this system was that so many crooks needed to be transported. The large cases required for carrying them were often works of art themselves.|$|R
40|$|Before the {{invention}} of valves, <b>orchestral</b> <b>horns</b> were generally equipped {{with a number of}} crooks of differing effective lengths to facilitate the use of the instrument in music of different tonalities. Even after the introduction of valves, some horns continued to be provided with detachable crooks. The experience of players is that the choice of crook critically affects the response of a horn, and that different crooks providing the same nominal pitch can have appreciably different playing properties. The bore profiles of a sizeable sample of terminally-fitting crooks with effective lengths up to 3. 5 m were derived from wide-band input impedance measurements using a multiple microphone technique. Bore profiles were also derived from time domain pulse reflectometry measurements for comparison. The correspondence between the bore profile of a crook and the intonation and ease of note initiation when played by appropriately experienced horn players was explored in a series of playing tests...|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "German horn" [...] {{is used to}} {{distinguish}} this instrument from other, similar types of <b>orchestral</b> <b>horn,</b> such as the French horn (in {{the sense of the}} type of instrument designed by French makers and favoured by French players) and the Vienna horn. The adjective is normally omitted when referring to the instrument, which in colloquial usage is sometimes confusingly referred to as the [...] "French" [...] horn. The added word [...] "French" [...] is still found in some tutors and instrumental books, but is now regarded as a colloquialism, having passed out of the usage of composers, scholars, and professional players since about 1930 because of the increasing ubiquity of the German horn. Since that time, the true French horn's use has been confined mainly to France, and even in that country the German horn was already gaining favour with some French players as early as 1938.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, the {{two most}} common styles ("wraps") of double horns are named Kruspe and Geyer/Knopf, after the German {{instrument}} makers who first developed and standardized them. The Kruspe wrap locates the B change valve above the first valve, near the thumb. The Geyer wrap has the change valve behind the third valve, near the little finger (although the valve's trigger is still played with the thumb). In effect, the air flows {{in a completely different}} direction in the two models. Kruspe-wrap horns tend to be larger in the bell throat than the Geyer-wrap horns. Typically, Kruspe models are constructed from nickel silver (also called German silver), while Geyer horns tend to be of yellow brass. Both models have their own strengths and weaknesses, and while the choice of instrument is very personal, an <b>orchestral</b> <b>horn</b> section is usually found to have either one or the other, owing to the differences in tone color, response, and projection of the two different styles.|$|E

40|$|Brass players {{sometimes}} adopt {{a technique}} whereby they adjust their embouchure {{in order to}} alter or bend the pitch of a note away from {{the centre of the}} resonance. The ease and control with which this can be achieved {{is an important factor in}} assessing the playability of a brass instrument. A good instrument will have well defined resonances, but experienced players do not like instruments with notes that are too ‘stiff’, and which lack sufficient flexibility for musical expression. The need for the ability to bend the pitch of a note is particularly important for natural trumpets and horns used in the baroque era, when instruments did not have valves and players were required to bend the pitch of some resonances (e. g. the 11 th and 13 th) by a significant fraction of a semitone. The instrument and player form a complex and closely coupled system. Using experimental data from playing tests on early <b>orchestral</b> <b>horns,</b> and comparing these results with those from a recently developed time domain model, it is possible to begin to identify features of an instrument and its interaction with a player which make it more or less susceptible to this type of manipulation.

5000|$|The name [...] "French horn" [...] {{is found}} only in English, first coming into use in the late 17th century. At that time, French makers were preeminent in the {{manufacture}} of hunting horns, and were credited with creating the now-familiar, circular [...] "hoop" [...] shape of the instrument. As a result, these instruments were often called, even in English, by their French names: trompe de chasse or cor de chasse (the clear modern distinction between trompes, trumpets, and cors, horns, did not exist at that time). German makers first devised crooks to make such horns playable in different keys—so musicians came to use [...] "French" [...] and [...] "German" [...] to distinguish the simple hunting horn from the newer horn with crooks, which in England was also called by the Italian name corno cromatico (chromatic horn). More recently, [...] "French horn" [...] is often used colloquially, though the adjective has normally been avoided when referring to the European <b>orchestral</b> <b>horn,</b> ever since the German horn began replacing the French-style instrument in British orchestras around 1930. The International Horn Society has recommended since 1971 that the instrument be simply called the horn.|$|E
5000|$|The German horn is a brass {{instrument}} made of tubing wrapped into a coil with a flared bell, and in {{bands and}} orchestras {{is the most}} widely used of three types of horn, the other two being the French horn (in the less common, narrower meaning of the term) and the Vienna horn. Its use among professional players has become so universal that it is only in France and Vienna that any other kind of horn is used today. A musician who plays the German horn is called a horn player (or less frequently, a hornist). The word [...] "German" [...] is used only to distinguish this instrument from the now-rare French and Viennese instruments. Although the expression [...] "French horn" [...] is still used colloquially in English for any <b>orchestral</b> <b>horn</b> (German, French, or Viennese), since the 1930s professional musicians and scholars have generally avoided this term in favour of just [...] "horn". Vienna horns today are played only in Vienna, and are made only by Austrian firms. German horns, by contrast, are not all made by German manufacturers (e.g., Paxman in London; Conn in the US), nor are all French-style instruments made in France (e.g., Reynolds, during the 1940s and 50s in the US).|$|E
5000|$|By {{the middle}} of the 19th century {{the most common type of}} single F horn was the German horn, with three rotary valves and a {{centrally}} placed slide crook. This instrument remained the dominant type of <b>orchestral</b> <b>horn</b> until the 1920s, by which time it had been supplanted by the (also German) double horn, introduced in 1897 by Fritz Kruspe of Erfurt. The French horn, using either two or three piston valves (also called Périnet valves after their inventor) and with crooks inserted at the mouthpipe end, continued to be preferred by many British orchestral players until the 1930s. By the mid-1940s, however, the German horn was achieving dominance in the UK. The last great British exponent of the French instrument was Dennis Brain who, even after the Second World War continued to favour the purer tone of his 1818 Raoux single horn until finally abandoning it for a four-valved B/A Alexander model 90 in October 1951. Though he did not like the sound as much, he said he [...] "was paid to get the notes" [...] and the German horn was [...] "virtually foolproof" [...] in contrast to the French horn. His father, Aubrey Brain, also a celebrated horn player and lifelong champion of the French style of instrument, declared that his son had given up the horn altogether.|$|E

Ten musical examples are included in order to illustrate the type of additional information that a player must gain so as to develop an in-depth knowledge of an excerpt. Three lists are presented within the text of this study: 1) a list of excerpts that are most commonly found at auditions, 2) a list of those excerpts that are often included and 3) other excerpts that have been requested but are not as commonly found. Also included is advice regarding the audition procedure itself, a discussion of the music required for auditions, and a guide to the orchestral excerpt books in which these passages can be found.

40|$|Gunther Schuller is {{presently}} one of America's most influential music personalities. As one colleague of Schuller's at the New England Conservatory has written, "In many ways, Gunther Schuller {{is a modern}} incarnation of the renaissance man, with his interests and abilities flowing from him like ripples in a pond. " 1 Schuller, in his six decades, {{has been one of}} the nation's first-rate <b>orchestral</b> <b>horn</b> players and has participated in the instrument's introduction into the jazz medium; his interest in musicological research has encompassed the study of various types of music and resulted in Early Jazz: Its Roots and Musical Development, 2 considered by some to be "the definitive musicological treatment of jazz history.. [...] ” 3 Schuller is also recognized as a leading contemporary composer and conductor, former composition instructor and long-time artistic co-director of the annual summer Tanglewood Festival, and teacher, authority, and author on horn playing. The dissertation traces Schuller's varied career, giving particular attention to his phenomenal success as a virtuoso of the French horn by age seventeen. The study also details his development as a composer, concentrating primarily on his compositional style as revealed in the works for horn as a solo and chamber music instrument. Among the works discussed are the horn concertos, the woodwind suite and brass quintet, Lines and Contrasts for sixteen horns, and Five Pieces for Five Horns. Included in the discussion is his unpublished and virtually unknown first Horn Concerto, which was written (and performed only once) by the composer while he was first horn in the Cincinnati Symphony. For the research, a copy of the manuscript was provided by the composer. (To date, the only published remnant is an arrangement of the second movement entitled Nocturne for horn and piano.) The dissertation examines Schuller's ideas concerning the "art" of modern horn playing through a discussion of his writings (Horn Technique), his musical studies (Studies for Unaccompanied Horn and Duets for Unaccompanied Horns), and through the observations of colleagues and former students. Fortunately, some of Schuller's well-articulated thoughts on musicianship in general and horn playing specifically have been retained in the tapes of the Sixth Annual International Horn Workshop, held at Ball State University in 1974. These are transcribed and included in the Appendix. In summary, the research is in three major sections. The first deals with biographical information [...] Schuller's various careers, a survey of his compositions and writings, and a discussion and evaluation of his playing career based on information from his colleagues, recordings, and reviews. Section two examines the composer’s style and his influence on the instrument’s technique through a detailed study of the solo and chamber works for horn. Part three concerns his pedagogical and philosophical ideas regarding music education, with particular attention to the horn and horn playing. 1.
