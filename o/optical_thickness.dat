40|$|Nulling stellar {{interferometry}} may {{enable the}} discovery of earth-like planets around other stars. In nulling mode, the zero order fringe is destructive and on axis, thus canceling light from a bright source and detecting dimer off-axis features. To create deep on-axis nulls, the phase must be shifted half a wave achromatically over a broad band. The phase shift is created by adding <b>optical</b> path <b>thickness</b> with dielectric plates. Plates of different materials can balance dispersion. The nulling solutions found for TPF (infrared) and for SIM (visible) are promising. This dissertation describes {{the implementation of a}} nulling beam combiner test bed and presents data characterizing its performance. Although the implementation was limited so that a broad band null of 10 E- 4 was not attained, the test bed revealed the extreme challenges of this technique and provided very valuable lessons that will enable future implementations to be successful and more precise. The nulling beam combiner testbed was implemented in the laboratory as a Michelson interferometer with the goal of achieving a stabilized, l 0 E- 4 null over a spectral region from 600 nm to 800 nm. The beam combiner system has three tiers of control. Tier 1 controls phase achromaticity by tilting optical plates and is a static control loop. Tier 2 sweeps through the white light fringe and then searches for the null as the air path drifts over minutes. Tier 3 stabilizes the null with a 300 hertz servo loop. A scheme for active control of the <b>optical</b> <b>thicknesses</b> was developed. The phase as a function of wavelength was measured by performing PSI on a spectrally dispersed fringe. The phase was fit to a model to solve for the <b>optical</b> <b>thicknesses.</b> The <b>optical</b> <b>thicknesses</b> were then adjusted to match the ideal thicknesses of an optimized solution. This process of measuring and adjusting the <b>optical</b> <b>thicknesses</b> is performed iteratively to achromatize the phase. The stabilizing servo loop sensed on a grey fringe at a short wavelength. At the shorter wavelength, the fringe was 90 degrees out of phase with the main pass band resulting in a grey fringe.

The droplet effective radii were smaller, and the liquid water paths and cloud <b>optical</b> <b>thicknesses</b> were larger in the updated simulation compared with the outdated simulation.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{two-dimensional}} study is the radially varying intensity emergent from a plane-parallel scattering medium exposed to a collimated, Gaussian laser beam directed perpendicular to the upper surface. The method of analysis is the integral transform technique. Specifically, this work uses the generalized reflection and transmission functions from a previous study to construct the emergent intensity {{with the use of}} an inverse Hankel transform. Radially varying backscattered and transmitted intensities are calculated for media with isotropic and Rayleigh scattering phase functions and <b>optical</b> <b>thicknesses</b> that range from 0. 125 to 8. 0. The behavior of the emergent radiation inside and outside the beam is investigated for both narrow and wide beams. A new integration method is implemented to compute the emergent intensity at the beam center. The emergent intensity at the beam center is used to quantify when a one-dimensional model may be used. As expected, for small <b>optical</b> <b>thicknesses</b> and near the beam the phase function has significant influence, while far from the beam multiple scattering reduces the influence of the Rayleigh phase function.

40|$|International audienceThe Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) {{launched}} in February 2002 on-board the ENVISAT spacecraft is making global observations of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiances. Aerosol optical properties are retrieved over land using Look-Up Table (LUT) based algorithm and surface reflectances {{in the blue}} and the red spectral regions. We compared instantaneous aerosol <b>optical</b> <b>thicknesses</b> retrieved by MERIS in the blue and the red at locations containing sites within the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET).

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the sensitivity to various atmospheric parameters of two height assignment methods that aim {{to retrieve the}} cloud-top height of semitransparent clouds.

The methods retrieve the pressure of a perfectly opaque cloud to within a few hectopascals. However, considering more realistic ice clouds, methods are sensitive to all of the tested atmospheric parameters and, especially, to the cloud microphysics, which can bias the results of the CO 2 -slicing method by several tens of hectopascals. The cloud-top pressure retrieval is especially difficult for thinner clouds with <b>optical</b> <b>thicknesses</b> smaller than 2, for which the errors can reach several tens of hectopascals. The methods have also been tested after introducing realistic perturbations in the temperature and humidity profiles and on the clear-sky surface radiances.

Eighty percent of the samples of droplet residue material had light absorption coefficients ranging from 6 to 20 × 10 ⁻⁸ m⁻¹ (where m⁻¹ means per meter of distance in the cloud, not in the cloud droplet nor in the dried bulk aerosol material). Calculated soot concentrations were between 23 and 79 ng soot g⁻¹ of cloud water.
