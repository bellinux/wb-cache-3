40|$|The {{biggest threat}} and cause to loss of {{biodiversity}} {{have been found}} to be the intensification of agriculture under the 20 th century. Messenia is one of the oldest <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> areas in Greece and the landscape is dominated by olive groves characterized by extensive tillage, which causes serious erosion and might be a threat to plant diversity. Organic <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> is an alternative that aims to preserve and support biodiversity. In this study the plant composition in the edge zones of an organic and a conventional olive grove in Messenia were inventoried to be able to investigate if organic cultivation methods enhance plant diversity. Moreover, other factors affecting plant diversity in olive groves and suggestions for precautions in the <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> sector to support biodiversity are discussed. The results show that the organic olive grove hosted 40 % higher species richness, which indicates, as in other similar studies, that the organic <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> methods have a higher capacity to support biodiversity. By restricting tillage and promoting organic <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation,</b> not only biodiversity would be enhanced; this could also prevent further soil erosion and create a more heterogenic agricultural landscape with higher biological and cultural values. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Minas Gerais is {{vulnerable}} to climate change, with negative impacts on water balance {{and changes in the}} cultivation of several crops. Currently, the olive crop has been an alternative source for farmers, especially those in the South of the state. However, there is no information on areas with climatic conditions suitable for <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation,</b> as well as the possible impacts of climate change. The aim {{of this study was to}} verify the impact of climate projections on water balance and agroclimatic zoning for <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> in the Minas Gerais, based on current climate conditions (1980 - 2011), and different climate change projections for three future periods (2011 - 2040, 2041 - 2070 and 2071 - 2100). For the current climate, Minas Gerais showed 37 % of suitable area, 15 % of marginal area and 48 % of unsuitable area for <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation.</b> For the period 2071 - 2100, only 4 % was classified as suitable area, 6 % as marginal area and 90 % as unsuitable.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 124 - 142) Since {{the time}} when Neolithic Man first developed the olive (Olea europaea) as a cultigen in the eastern Mediterranean region over 6000 years ago, the fruit has had a prolonged and significant influence on the pattern of man's habitation in both the Mediterranean world and in Spanish America. It has been hypothesized by many scholars that <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> originated somewhere within the eastern Mediterranean region. From this point, <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> diffused throughout the Mediterranean basin. It is suggested that the fruit was first introduced into Spain by the Phoenicians around 1000 B. C. From Spain, the practice of <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> was transmitted to the New World by Spanish agriculturalists who sailed to the West Indies with Christopher Columbus [...] possibly as early as 1493. <b>Olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> then diffused within the New World, via the various Spanish settlements and missionary outposts, until it reached California shortly after 1769. <b>Olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> diffused {{to most of the}} California Franciscan missions by 1800, and subsequently spread to the present-day production areas in the inland valleys of the State, where there are currently over 40, 000 acres devoted to the cultivation of this crop. A study of the olive industry in the San Fernando Valley [...] which was taken to be representative of the impact that <b>olive</b> <b>cultivation</b> had on areas adjacent to mission sites [...] revealed that the industry was not as successful {{as it was in the}} interior regions of the State. The combined pressure of four main factors over a period of years served to create a situation that was not conducive to the success of the olive industry in the Valley: (1) a steady in-flow of people whose demand for residential housing, and the associated commercial and industrial development, caused a persistent encroachment of urban activities into the olive-growing district; (2) an increase in the valuation of orchard lands as the demand for new land for housing increased; (3) the non-availability of low-wage labor upon the termination of the Bracero Program in 1964; and (4) the fact that a scientific study revealed that climatic conditions in the Valley were never really conducive to quality olive production in the first place...|$|R
