40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} {{the present state of}} {{national}} and public <b>senior</b> <b>citizen</b> center buildings and users in Seocho-gu, Seoul. For this study, the general characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>senior</b> <b>citizen</b> centers and users were analyzed. In this study, a survey with 298 <b>senior</b> <b>citizen</b> center users was conducted. The general characteristics such as the names and locations <b>of</b> <b>senior</b> <b>citizen</b> centers, the number of members, the opening periods and building areas, the general characteristics of the users, the reasons for use, the total years of use, the hours of use, the programs and the time required for coming to the <b>senior</b> <b>citizen</b> centers were investigated. The study findings are as follows. First, 75 % of all the users were females and they were 3 times more than males. The average age of the users was 82 years old and those in their eighties occupied half the users. People who used these centers, were healthy enough to do their jobs by themselves and those who only finished elementary education or below and secondary education, used these centers together. The monthly average income of the users was less than 200, 000 won to more than 500, 000 won. Second, meeting friends was the biggest reason for using the <b>senior</b> <b>citizen</b> centers and it was followed by eating meals. Female members used lunch that was provided free by the facilities and male members came to the facilities in the afternoon after eating lunch at home, since it was hard for them to receive this benefit. These study results can be used as basic data to compare the regional differences <b>of</b> <b>senior</b> <b>citizen</b> centers and the difference between national and public facilities and private facilities and between users. Furthermore, an advance study will be carried out to suggest development and support plans <b>of</b> <b>senior</b> <b>citizen</b> centers in Korea that are becoming more important, with the aging of population...|$|R

The Democratic National Committee and AFL-CIO then worked together to transform the Kennedy group into the National Council <b>of</b> <b>Senior</b> <b>Citizens</b> (NCSC). The new organization was formally announced in July 1961. The United Auto Workers and United Steelworkers pushed their retirees to sign up as members, and both unions as well as the AFL-CIO contributed seed-money to finance the group. Forand, who had retired from office in 1960, became the NCSC's first president and William Hutton, a public relations official with the AFL-CIO, its first executive director.|$|E

However the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study that demonstrated that the risks of HRT outweighed the benefits has since led to a decline in HRT usage.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} satisfaction of clients with nursing care in <b>senior</b> <b>citizen</b> homes. The theoretical {{part of my}} thesis describes old age and aging, changes in old age, {{the importance of family}} support, quality of provided care and also <b>senior</b> <b>citizen</b> homes. In the practical part I have compared two - in terms of size - different <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> homes. The main objective was to determine the level of satisfaction of clients in the <b>senior</b> <b>citizen</b> homes with the provided nursing care. Three hypotheses were formulated for the purpose. H 1 : Clients <b>of</b> the <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> homes are satisfied with the nursing care; H 2 : The size <b>of</b> <b>senior</b> <b>citizen</b> homes affects satisfaction of the clients with the nursing care; and H 3 : The size <b>of</b> <b>senior</b> <b>citizen</b> homes affects overall satisfaction of the clients. The research used a qualitative survey method with questionnaires. The questionnaire contained 23 questions. Two <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> homes were selected to collect data. The first one was a big <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> home Máj in České Budějovice, with the capacity of 127 clients, and the second one was a smaller <b>senior</b> <b>citizen</b> home in Kaplice for 54 clients. 50 questionnaires were distributed in each facility, i. e. 100 questionnaires in total. The results have shown that 50 % of the clients ranked the nursing care as excellent and 38 % as very good. This means that the hypothesis No. 1 has been confirmed. Also the hypothesis No. 2 has been confirmed as clients in the smaller facility had more confidence in the nursing staff {{as a result of a}} closer and more personal relationship and therefore they also gave better ranking to the quality of nursing care. The hypothesis No. 3 has not been confirmed. The size <b>of</b> <b>senior</b> <b>citizen</b> homes does not affect the overall satisfaction of the clients. The comparison of results from the questionnaires from the involved facilities has shown that both the homes have their pros and contras. Among the advantages clients from the smaller home mentioned a more personal approach, family atmosphere and sufficiently quiet environment. As a negative they mentioned lack of cultural activities. In the bigger facility the clients praised opportunities to enjoy cultural life but they did not like lack of quiet environment and a less personal approach of the nursing staff...|$|R
