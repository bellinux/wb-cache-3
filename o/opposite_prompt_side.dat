40|$|A {{historical}} {{study and}} a construction pathology survey were conducted prior to proposing {{a solution for}} restoring the upper windows {{on the south side}} of Old San Carlos College at Saragossa (16 th- 17 th centuries), wich had been forteited to add a third storey to the cloister. Althought initially designed to a simple large hall format, the church is a harmonius blend of Aragonese Gothic architecture and typical Jesuit scheme, consisting in a central nave flanket by chapel-confessional and raised galleries for the community. A subsequent enlargement of the roof, wich rests on the original framing over the central nave, reduced the mechanical strength of the principal rafters on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side,</b> <b>prompting</b> a concomitant imbalance of forces that has affected the entire structure. In view of the foregoing, in addition to restituting the upper window, the proposal solution envisages restoring the roof over the central nave to its original design, and with the interior lighting in the church...|$|R

6000|$|Sir Chester Portwood, {{ploughing}} his {{way through}} a long speech, stopped and looked apprehensively over his shoulder. The girl with the lisp, who had been listening in a perfunctory manner to the long speech, screamed loudly.

She had bright, bulging eyes and a lot of yellow hair, and when she spoke she showed about fifty-seven front teeth. She was one of those women who kind of numb a fellow's faculties. She made me feel as if I were ten years old and had been brought into the drawing-room in my Sunday clothes to say how-d'you-do.

2500|$|Around 11:20pm, while {{preparations}} for the final act were under way, stage manager J. W. Thorpe saw a small flame on the left, or <b>prompt</b> <b>side</b> of the stage. The fire {{was coming from the}} lower part of a drop hanging below the rigging loft near the center stage border-light. The canvas was hanging, partially detached, from its frame and, Thorpe thought, somehow must have slipped past the wire mesh guard of the border lamp and ignited. He estimated its size to be no larger than his hand. Though water in paint buckets was once kept on hand on the stage and in the rigging loft and though a two and a half inch (...) water pipe still serviced a fire hose backstage, none of these facilities was readily available. Thorpe considered the fire hose, but there was much scenery in the way. He decided that the fire would be well under way by the time the hose was in place. He opted to extinguish the flame by whatever means were readily available. He directed carpenters Hamilton Weaver and William Van Sicken to extinguish the flame. They attempted this by beating the fire with long stage poles.|$|R

Then all his bones were taken away,--still by the Thunder Cat,--and he fell into a horrid heap, illuminated by the small boy with the candle--and would not recover himself till somebody spoke to a magic parrot, and a huge hairy villain and several coolies had walked over him. Then he was a girl, but, hiding behind a parasol, resumed his shape, and then the curtain came down and the audience ran about the stage and circulated generally. One small boy took it into his head that he could turn head-over-heels from the <b>Prompt</b> <b>side</b> across. With great gravity, before the unregarding house, he set to work; but rolled over sideways with a flourish of chubby legs. Nobody cared, and the polite people in the gallery could not understand why the Professor and I were helpless with laughter when the child, with a clog for a sword, imitated the strut of the two-sworded man.

40|$|Here {{we report}} the first {{detection}} of polarization signals {{induced by the}} Zeeman effect in spectral lines of the E 4 Π − A 4 Π system of FeH located around 1. 6 µm. Motivated by the tentative detection of this band in the intensity spectrum of late-type dwarfs, we have investigated the full Stokes sunspot spectrum finding circular and linear polarization signatures that we associate with the FeH lines of the E 4 Π − A 4 Π band system. We investigate the Zeeman effect in these molecular transitions pointing out that in Hund’s case (a) coupling the effective Landé factors are never negative. For this reason, {{the fact that our}} spectropolarimetric observations indicate that the Landé factors of pairs of FeH lines have <b>opposite</b> signs, <b>prompt</b> us to conclude that the E 4 Π−A 4 Π system must be in intermediate angular momentum coupling between Hund’s cases (a) and (b).
