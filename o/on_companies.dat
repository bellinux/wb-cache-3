40|$|The {{difference}} between market value and book {{value of a}} company is attributed to Intellectual Capital (IC). This difference is as an Indicator to recognize the efficiency or inefficiency of a company. Therefore, the effective use of IC {{is one of the}} most important factors <b>on</b> <b>company</b> efficiency. IC is a group of knowledge assets and one of these knowledge assets is Corporate Social Capital (CSC). CSC is a kind of intangible assets and it is argued that the main dimensions of CSC are relevant to IC. In this paper, CSC is defined as the characteristics of the IC, Corporate Reputation (CR), and Structural Social Capital (SSC). The problems that this study has focused on are (i) absence of known and clear mechanism for assessing the impact of CSC <b>on</b> <b>company</b> efficiency, (ii) applying an indicator to assess the efficiency instead applying a set of indicators, and (iii) disregard of financial soundness as an effective element <b>on</b> <b>company</b> efficiency. Base <b>on</b> the problem of the study, the objectives of this study are (i) to examine the relationship between CSC and company efficiency, (ii) to determine the effects of each one of CSC’s components <b>on</b> <b>company</b> efficiency, and (iii) to examine the interaction effects of variable or variables that have unexpected results <b>on</b> <b>company</b> efficiency. The data were analyzed used by (i) Multiple Regression, (ii) Post Hoc Analysis (PHA), and (iii) Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The results showed that (i) CSC has an important influence <b>on</b> <b>company</b> efficiency, (ii) Centrality, Human Capital and Financial Soundness have positive influence <b>on</b> <b>company</b> efficiency, and (iii) Research Intensity and Internal Capital have negative influence <b>on</b> <b>company</b> efficiency. Lastly, Financial Soundness can counteract the negative influences of Research Intensity and Internal Capital <b>on</b> <b>company</b> efficiency. The results of the study suggested that (i) added value of CSC to different companies in the ICT sector showed be recognized (ii) showed a theoretical model for CSC, and (iii) External Capital is substituted by company Centrality in IC. The findings of the study also show the importance of IC and CSC <b>on</b> <b>company</b> efficiency and it is recommended that CSC should be considered as an important element <b>on</b> <b>company</b> efficiency that has influence on financial statements...|$|R

25|$|In the end, {{options for}} the {{financing}} of the purchase came down to two companies, Westpac and Allco Leasing. One {{of the more interesting}} notes to the Allco proposal was the nature of the financing arrangements it was proposing. At the time of the proposed financing deal, interest rates in Australia were around 16-17%, placing a significant burden <b>on</b> <b>companies</b> in their business dealings. To work around this, Allco proposed a financing structure that involved a cross-border financing arrangement in Japan. It also required the establishment of a special purposes lessor company, incorporated in the Cayman Islands, to minimise withholding tax liabilities from the Japanese and Australian taxation agencies. Allco refused to release specific information on the proposed structure, due to its policy prohibiting the release of specific details of this financing arrangement until it had secured a mandate for their services.|$|E
25|$|A {{flat tax}} system and income taxes overall are not {{inherently}} border-adjustable; meaning the tax component embedded into products via taxes imposed <b>on</b> <b>companies</b> (including corporate taxes and payroll taxes) are not removed when exported {{to a foreign}} country (see Effect of taxes and subsidies on price). Taxation systems such as a sales tax or value added tax can remove the tax component when goods are exported and apply the tax component on imports. The domestic products could be at a disadvantage to foreign products (at home and abroad) that are border-adjustable, which would impact the global competitiveness of a country. However, it's possible that a flat tax system could be combined with tariffs and credits to act as border adjustments (the proposed Border Tax Equity Act in the U.S. attempts this). Implementing an income tax with a border adjustment tax credit {{is a violation of}} the World Trade Organization agreement. Tax exemptions (allowances) on low income wages, a component of most income tax systems could mitigate this issue for high labour content industries like textiles that compete Globally.|$|E

500|$|Goodman sees {{schools as}} {{mechanisms}} for adjusting youth to an automated society increasingly absent [...] "any human values". Goodman disagrees {{with those who}} say public schools teach middle class values, as he sees schools as more petit bourgeois than bourgeois, favoring [...] "bureaucratic, time-serving, grade-grind-practical, timid, and nouveau riche climbing" [...] over [...] "independence, initiative, scrupulous honesty, earnestness, utility, [...] respect for thorough scholarship". In this way, schooling {{is not a good}} use of student time, and students are right to quit and avoid the psychological and professional damage. More important is the disintegration of social class segregation. Goodman then asserts that lower- and middle-class kids would be better off without public or any schooling altogether. He proposes several alternatives to formal schooling, such as divvying up the high school's public funds directly amongst its students, and advocates for a variety of experimental school alternatives: [...] "no school at all, the real city as school, farm schools, practical apprenticeships, guided travel, work camps, little theaters and local newspapers, [...] community service". Other proposals include making class non-compulsory (such that attendance will reflect student interest without [...] "trapping" [...] children), requiring students to wait two years before applying to the most elite colleges, eliminating grades so the burden of testing for required skills falls <b>on</b> <b>companies,</b> and letting students quit and resume freely. He proposes Danish folk school-style education for those uninterested in academics. Goodman's foremost intention was to stimulate new educational paradigms. He acknowledges that his specific proposals may be unpopular or ignored.|$|E

There are diverse fundamental theories which discuss diversification, namely Market Power View, Resources Based View, Internal Transaction Cost, and Agency Theory.

This research aims at describing and analyzing the role of diversification <b>on</b> <b>company</b> value, diversification <b>on</b> financing mix, financing mix <b>on</b> <b>company</b> value and financing mix as a mediating variable of diversification <b>on</b> <b>company</b> value. This research was conducted in secondary sectors of Indonesian Stock Exchange in 2006 - 2010.
