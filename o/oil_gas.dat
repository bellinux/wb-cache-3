5|$|The Macdonald family {{obtained}} complete {{ownership of}} the park in 1951. After leaving Idlewild, the Mellon family also abandoned the Ligonier Valley Railroad, in decline after the closing of area coal mines and decreased passenger traffic. The railroad ceased operations in 1952. Although the park originally depended on the railroad, its closing had no effect. In 1913, the Lincoln Highway had been established as the first cross-country auto route, stretching from Times Square, New York City, to Lincoln Park, San Francisco. It passed directly by Idlewild on what is now U.S. Route 30. As automobile traffic to the park increased, several parking lots and a Gulf <b>Oil</b> <b>gas</b> station, a Mellon company, were added in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} failed {{attempts}} to extract {{oil from the}} salt domes near Beaumont, a small enterprise known as the Gladys City <b>Oil,</b> <b>Gas,</b> and Manufacturing Company was joined in 1899 by Croatian/Austrian mechanical engineer Anthony F. Lucas, an expert in salt domes. Lucas joined the company {{in response to the}} numerous ads the company's founder Pattillo Higgins placed in industrial magazines and trade journals. Lucas and his colleagues struggled for two years to find oil at a location known as Spindletop Hill before making a strike in 1901. The new well produced approximately 100,000 barrels of oil per day, an unprecedented level of production at the time. The 1902 total annual production at Spindletop exceeded 17 million barrels. The state's total production in 1900 had been only 836,000 barrels. The overabundance of supply led oil prices in the U.S. to drop to a record low of 3 cents per barrel, less than the price of water in some areas.|$|E

40|$|<b>Oil</b> and <b>gas</b> {{producers}} face three threats: prolonged low <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> prices, {{tightening of}} climate policy and a tough budget on cumulative carbon emissions, and technological innovation producing cheap substitutes for <b>oil</b> and <b>gas.</b> These threats pose real risks of putting <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> producers out of business. They {{lead to the}} problem of stranded assets and a significant downward valuation of <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> producers. This calls for divesting from and shorting coal, <b>oil,</b> and <b>gas.</b> The economies of oil- and gas-rich countries are typically in a deplorable state, since they did not use their past windfalls to build up buffers and invest in a diversified economy.

5|$|Higgins sued Lucas and Gladys City <b>Oil,</b> <b>Gas</b> and Manufacturing Company for royalties, {{using the}} basis that the second lease was invalid because the first lease had not yet expired when the second was enacted. After the parties settled out of court, Higgins formed the Higgins Oil and Fuel Company located {{at the center of}} Spindletop. This company was {{vulnerable}} to takeover bids due to Higgins' over-zealous land prospecting, which enabled the lumber baron and businessman John Henry Kirby to overtake his ownership in 1902 by purchasing his shares of the company for $3 million. Higgins maintained his leasing rights to his land, and would establish the Higgins Standard Oil Company. He later established other wells with various investors, with an eccentric habit of pulling his interests out, leaving the majority of the profits for others.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources is {{responsible}} for general strategy in {{the oil and gas}} sectors and for monitoring the state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco. The <b>oil,</b> <b>gas</b> and refining industries in Saudi Arabia are controlled by law by Saudi Aramco, which has a near monopoly in these areas. It is the world's biggest oil producer, the Middle East's biggest company and is generally considered {{to be the most important}} energy company in the world. However, in 2003, the law was changed to allow foreign companies to look for Saudi Arabia's vast reserves of natural gas, believed to represent 4% of the world's reserves. This was the first time since the 1970s that foreign companies have been permitted to search for oil or gas.|$|E
5|$|Threats to otter {{populations in}} North America vary regionally. Otter inhabitation is {{affected}} by type, distribution, and density of aquatic habitats and characteristics of human activities. Preceding the settlement of North America by Europeans, otters were prevalent among aquatic habitats {{throughout most of the}} continent. Trapping, loss or degradation of aquatic habitats through filling of wetlands, and development of coal, <b>oil,</b> <b>gas,</b> tanning, timber, and other industries, resulted in extirpations, or declines, in otter populations in many areas. In 1980, an examination conducted on U.S. river otter populations determined they were extirpated in 11 states, and had experienced drastic lapses in 9 others. The most severe population declines occurred in interior regions where fewer aquatic habitats supported fewer otter populations. Although the distribution became reduced in some regions of southern Canada, the only province-wide extirpation occurred on Prince Edward Island.|$|E
40|$|The {{existing}} volumetric {{approach was}} honored {{by considering the}} effects of <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> saturations on the evaluation of geothermal resources in <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> reservoirs. The main reason to do so was that <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> phases may not be simply substituted by water because {{the values of the}} specific heat of <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> are smaller than that of water. We selected an oil reservoir, Hexiwu, from Huabei oil field as an example to apply the method. The effects of <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> saturation on the geothermal reserve were investigated at different values of porosity and the results were compared to the existing approaches. It was found that the existing volumetric method tends to overestimate the geothermal reserves in <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> reservoirs. The greater the <b>oil</b> or <b>gas</b> saturation is, the more the overestimation of the geothermal reserve is. The results showed {{that it is necessary to}} consider the effects of <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> saturations on the estimation of geothermal reserve in <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> reservoirs...|$|R

5|$|Three {{years after}} {{the closure of the}} A Station, rumours began to {{circulate}} that the B Station would soon follow. A campaign was then launched to try to save the building as part of the national heritage. As a result, the station was declared a heritage site in 1980, when the Secretary of State for the Environment, Michael Heseltine, awarded the building Grade II listed status. (This was upgraded to Grade II* listed in 2007.) On 31 October 1983 production of electricity at Station B also ended, after nearly 30 years of operation. By then the B Station's generating capacity had fallen to 146MW. The closure of the two stations was put down largely to the generating equipment becoming outdated, and the preferred choice of fuel for electricity generation shifting from coal toward <b>oil,</b> <b>gas</b> and nuclear power. Since the station ceased generating electricity, there have been numerous proposals and attempts to redevelop the site.|$|E
5|$|The Met {{opened with}} no stock of its own, with the GWR {{and then the}} GNR {{providing}} services. The GWR used eight-wheeled compartment carriages constructed from teak. By 1864, the Met had taken delivery of its own stock, made by the Ashbury Railway Carriage & Iron Co., based on the GWR design but standard gauge. Lighting was provided by gasâ€” two jets in first class compartments and one in second and third class compartments, and from 1877 a pressurised <b>oil</b> <b>gas</b> system was used. Initially the carriages were braked with wooden blocks operated by hand from the guards' compartments at {{the front and back}} of the train, giving off a distinctive smell. This was replaced in 1869 by a chain that operated brakes on all carriages. The operation of the chain brake could be abrupt, leading to some passenger injuries, and it was replaced by a non-automatic vacuum brake by 1876. In the 1890s, a mechanical 'next station' indicator was tested in some carriages on the circle, triggered by a wooden flap between the tracks. It was considered unreliable and not approved for full installation.|$|E
5|$|However the ECSC {{failed to}} achieve several {{fundamental}} aims of the Treaty of Paris. It was hoped the ECSC would prevent a resurgence of large coal and steel {{groups such as the}} Konzerne, which helped Adolf Hitler rise to power. In the Cold War trade-offs, the cartels and major companies re-emerged, leading to apparent price fixing (another element that was meant to be tackled). With a democratic supervisory system the worst aspects of past abuse were avoided with the anti-cartel powers of the Authority, the first international anti-cartel agency in the world. Efficient firms were allowed to expand into a European market without undue domination. <b>Oil,</b> <b>gas,</b> electricity became natural competitors to coal and also broke cartel powers. Furthermore, with the move to oil, the Community failed to define a proper energy policy. The Euratom treaty was largely stifled by de Gaulle and the European governments refused the suggestion of an Energy Community involving electricity and other vectors that was suggested at Messina in 1955. In a time of high inflation and monetary instability ECSC also fell short of ensuring an upward equalisation of pay of workers within the market. These failures could be put down to overambition {{in a short period of}} time, or that the goals were merely political posturing to be ignored. It has been argued that the greatest achievements of the European Coal and Steel Community lie in its revolutionary democratic concepts of a supranational Community.|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the problem of {{development}} of <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> service. The transformation of the <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> sector with the separation of independent enterprises and organizations providing services in the <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> service sector is compared by the author with the trend of rapid development of the service sector in the postindustrial economy. The purpose of the study is to identify the general and specific characteristics of modern <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> services and to determine the directions for the transformation of organizational forms of entrepreneurship in the sphere under consideration. The growth of quantitative parameters of the <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> services market has been analyzed. The classification of this market is proposed depending on the place of services in a single technological cycle in relation to the main oil production process. The positive consequences of the development of <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> services for the development of <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> production have been systematized. Basic organizational models of entrepreneurship development in <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> service are generalized and substantiated. It is shown that the main influence in the market of services is taken by vertically integrated national <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> companies, as well as by international companies that provide service support for the work of Russian <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> companies. The results of a comparative analysis of advantages and disadvantages of organizational models of entrepreneurship in the field of <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> services are presented. It is proved that <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> service as an organizational form of entrepreneurship in its development reflects the general trends of the post-industrial economy. Specific features of <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> service in Russia are singled out. The revealed directions of transformation of organizational forms of entrepreneurship in the sphere of <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> service in current conditions can be used in the formation of state programs in the field of industrial development, the high-tech sector, and in working out strategies for the development of enterprises and organizations providing services in the <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> sector...|$|R
