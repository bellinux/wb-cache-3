40|$|In {{this thesis}} I explore an {{alternative}} formulation <b>of</b> the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice. The <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice are {{the circumstances that}} make human cooperation necessary and possible, and because human cooperation is necessary to justice, they make justice both necessary and possible. For constructivists, principles of justice respond to these <b>circumstances.</b> Standard accounts <b>of</b> the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice {{can be found in}} Hobbes, Hume, and Rawls, and many contemporary theorists rely on these accounts. My dissertation rejects these standard accounts <b>of</b> the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice—on the grounds of exclusion and trust—and defends an alternative account. A core idea of my proposed alternative is that the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice must be understood in terms of solidarity. A proper understanding of the role of solidarity in an adequate characterization <b>of</b> the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice requires a good grasp of the nature of solidarity itself. To that end I offer a novel account of solidarity which I argue improves existing theories of solidarity. In {{the first part of this}} project I explain the role and importance <b>of</b> the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice. I then offer a full description of solidarity and its normative character. In the second half of the project I offer my new account <b>of</b> the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice, including an explanation and examples of how broad the scope of this reformulation is. I conclude the project by applying my new account <b>of</b> the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice to the problem of climate change, and ask whether we can now construe the coordination of resources between generations as a problem of justice...|$|R

5|$|Considering {{the weight}} of attack against airfields, hardly any fighters were {{destroyed}} on the ground. Figures indicated just two Spitfires and six Hurricanes were lost in this manner. The main reason for this was the high state of readiness of RAF units during daylight. The command depended on radar and the Observer Corps warning them in advance, giving them {{plenty of time to}} get airborne. The successful strafing attack by Bf 109s of JG 52 on Manston depended on a combination <b>of</b> <b>circumstances</b> and chance which did not occur often during the battle.|$|E
5|$|Home Made Mince Pie is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is a comedy <b>of</b> <b>circumstances,</b> in which the Gale family is going to host a dinner. The focus of the humor is in a mince pie that brandy is added to {{in an attempt to}} make it more appreciable, but three people each add brandy to the pie. Everyone becomes tipsy upon eating the pie, including the family cat, and the film concludes. No cast or staff credits for this film are known. The film was released on September 27, 1910, to mixed reviews in trade publications. Reviewers mentioned that the film was too long and it was unbelievable that one pie split eight ways would be able to impact everyone. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is, first, to address three recent criticisms of Hume's account <b>of</b> the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice, and secondly, to {{consider}} how an account <b>of</b> the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice may be deployed in philosophical argument when detached from Hume's own narrow concern with rules of property. Against the criticisms lodged by Brian Barry and Martha Nussbaum, I argue that Hume does not build a conception of justice as mutual advantage into the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice. Against the criticism lodged against modern invocations <b>of</b> the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice by Gerry Cohen, I argue that any plausible account of deliberative reflection must be at once action-guiding and world-guided. This allows an account <b>of</b> the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice-those features of the world no plausible theory of justice can idealize away-to do some justificatory work...|$|R
5|$|Not every {{transitional}} form {{appears in}} the fossil record, because the fossil record is not complete.

5|$|Special {{considerations}} {{have been}} given for contestants who were unable to return as champion because <b>of</b> <b>circumstances</b> beyond their control, especially {{when there is a}} considerable time between taping of episodes.

Ball returned as a co-champion to play on the episode airing April 9, 2009. On the episode aired December 21, 2015, the returning champion, Claudia Corriere, could not return as champion because of a job offered in the weeks between tapings, so three new contestants played that day as well. Corriere returned as a co-champion on the January 18, 2016, episode, but was eliminated in a three-way loss.|$|E

Marie's focus changes from money to marriage, a sign of hope amid the tragedy <b>of</b> <b>circumstances.</b> When she first considers Montauran, she recognizes that a return of the king would bring privileges; still, her oscillating actions follow the path of her passions, not rational self-interest.|$|E

5|$|This amendment, {{as well as}} the Fourteenth, is {{undoubtedly}} self-executing, without any ancillary legislation, so far as its terms are applicable to any existing state <b>of</b> <b>circumstances.</b> By its own unaided force and effect, it abolished slavery and established universal freedom. Still, legislation may be necessary and proper to meet all the various cases and circumstances to be affected by it, and to prescribe proper modes of redress for its violation in letter or spirit. And such legislation may be primary and direct in its character, for the amendment is not a mere prohibition of State laws establishing or upholding slavery, but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of the United States.|$|E

5|$|Okada {{described}} the main theme as power achieved through intelligence and overcoming the environments. The main narrative featured multiple references to Chinese mythology, {{while many of}} the player characters drew from historical and literary figures from each country the game visited. The Hakke leaders of the Sangokai were designed around a particular part of their body being malformed. A narrative element carried over from the Megami Tensei franchise was a system of choices based on morality that influenced the ending; while these elements had been thoroughly explored in Megami Tensei, the team felt the themes still had potential and so used it in Maken X. The game was Atlus' first title to feature full voice acting; the team initially planned to voice event scenes in English and Chinese with Japanese subtitles, but included voice acting across the whole game due to positive feedback. A similar set <b>of</b> <b>circumstances</b> led to the wide use of stereophonic sound across the whole game when it was initially planned only for action sequences.|$|E

Eberhardt asked him for every detail he could give her {{about life in the}} Sahara, also informing him of her dreams of escaping Geneva alongside her favourite sibling, Augustin. Letord encouraged the two of them to relocate to Bône, Algeria, where he could assist them in establishing a new life. In a series <b>of</b> <b>circumstances</b> that remain unclear though involved financial debts and ties to Russian revolutionist groups with which he was affiliated, Augustin fled Geneva in 1894. Eberhardt probably assisted him initially but was unable to keep track of his whereabouts despite making constant inquiries. In November 1894 Eberhardt was informed by a letter that Augustin had joined the French Foreign Legion and was assigned to Algeria. While at first furious with Augustin's decision, Eberhardt's anger did not last; she asked him to send her a detailed diary of what he saw in North Africa.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecological}} complexities {{human beings}} are facing through the technological transformation of the planetary biome has brought on the Anthropocene. The unique set <b>of</b> <b>circumstances</b> has generated {{the need for a}} new unifying science called coupled human and natural systems that builds upon, but moves beyond the field of human ecology. Ecosystems tie into human societies through the critical and all encompassing life-supporting functions they sustain. In recognition of these functions and the incapability of traditional economic valuation methods to see the value in ecosystems, there has been a surge of interest in social-natural capital, which provides the means to put a value on the stock and use of information and materials stemming from ecosystem goods and services. Ecosystems produce, regulate, maintain, and supply services of critical necessity and beneficial to human health (cognitive and physiological), economies, and they even provide an information or reference function as a living library giving opportunities for science and cognitive development in children engaged in the complexity of the natural world. Ecosystems relate importantly to human ecology as they are the ultimate base foundation of global economics as every commodity, and the capacity for exchange ultimately stems from the ecosystems on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless <b>of</b> <b>circumstances</b> and even if it is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E
