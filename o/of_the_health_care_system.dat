5|$|The ACA {{includes}} {{provisions to}} take effect between 2010 and 2020, although most took effect on January 1, 2014. Few areas of the US health care system were left untouched, making it the most sweeping health care reform since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. However, some areas were more affected than others. The individual insurance market was radically overhauled, {{and many of the}} law's regulations applied specifically to this market, while the structure of Medicare, Medicaid, and the employer market were largely retained. Most of the coverage gains were made through the expansion of Medicaid, and the biggest cost savings were made in Medicare. Some regulations applied to the employer market, and the law also made delivery system changes that affected most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system.</b> Not all provisions took full effect. Some were made discretionary, some were deferred, and others were repealed before implementation.|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to analyze}} <b>the</b> impacts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first phase <b>of</b> {{minister}} Leos Heger's <b>health</b> <b>care</b> reform on <b>the</b> financial stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Czech <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system. <b>The</b> specific features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> market {{are taken into}} consideration in the analysis. Heger's reform is introduced in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Czech <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system since <b>the</b> early 90 's and its main problems are identified by analyzing financial flows in <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system. Measures within the reforms are analyzed by using the methodology conceived by experts from the working group Kulatý stůl (2009) who presented <b>the</b> guidelines <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> reforms in <b>the</b> European countries. <b>The</b> measures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> reform are estimated to have a minor impact upon <b>the</b> sustainability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> financing in <b>the</b> Czech republic...|$|R

25|$|In December 2011 the {{outgoing}} Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Donald Berwick, asserted that 20% to 30% {{of health care}} spending is waste. He listed five causes for the waste: (1) overtreatment of patients, (2) the failure to coordinate care, (3) the administrative complexity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system,</b> (4) burdensome rules and (5) fraud.|$|E
25|$|Ever since a major reform <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> in 2006, the Dutch system {{received}} more {{points in the}} Index each year. According to the HCP (Health Consumer Powerhouse), the Netherlands has 'a chaos system', meaning patients have a great degree of freedom from where to buy their health insurance, to where they get their healthcare service. But {{the difference between the}} Netherlands and other countries is that the chaos is managed. Healthcare decisions are being made in a dialogue between the patients and healthcare professionals.|$|E
25|$|People {{infected}} with chronic hepatitis C {{tend to be}} frequent users <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> globally. It {{has been estimated that}} a person {{infected with}} hepatitis C in the United States will result in a monthly cost of $691. That number nearly doubles to $1,227 for people with compensated (stable) cirrhosis, while the monthly cost of people with decompensated (worsening) cirrhosis is almost five times as large at $3,682. The wide-ranging effects of hepatitis make it difficult to estimate indirect costs, but studies have speculated that the total cost is $6.5 billion annually in the United States. In Canada, 56% of HCV related costs are attributable to cirrhosis and total expenditures related to the virus are expected to peak at CAD$396 million in the year 2032.|$|E

Hobson-Gonzalez from Kokomo, Indiana), a programme of free milk for children in the schools and shanty towns of Chile, and an expansion of the land seizure and redistribution already begun under his predecessor Eduardo Frei Montalva, who had nationalized between one-fifth and one-quarter of all the properties listed for takeover. Allende also intended to improve the socio-economic welfare of Chile's poorest citizens; a key element was to provide employment, either in the new nationalized enterprises or on public work projects.|$|E
