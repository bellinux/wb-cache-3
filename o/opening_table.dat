Special Issue Sessions include three Department of Defense sessions, Air Source Emissions Measurement and Monitoring, NELAC/ACIL technical issues, Field/New Technologies, Data Quality and Validation Under PBMS, and three sessions on EPA's Data and Information Quality Improvement. All of these are in addition to our regular featured sessions on organic and inorganic analyses and our poster sessions. In addition, the first NIST Workshop on Proficiency Test Studies will be held separate from, but in association with, WTQA 2001. Our short courses also reflect an expanded breadth of topics that range from a DoD course on Inappropriate Lab Practices to field and laboratory technologies that include organic mass spectrometry, solid phase extraction techniques, field analytical technology {{including the use of}} immunoassays, the new FORMS II Lite system, and RCRA analytical strategies. In addition, courses on assessor training, permit writing under PBMS, and PBMS training are offered. This strong and varied technical program is designed to help you learn about important changes and advances occurring in the field of environmental analytical chemistry.

40|$|Most {{drainage}} theories {{ignore the}} effect of drain tube <b>openings</b> on water <b>table</b> drawdown. Kirkham and Schwab (1951) and Schwab and Kirkham (1951) developed methods for predicting {{the effect of}} circular openings in drain tubes on drainage rates for ponded surface conditions. Their results showed that drainage rates for standard drain tubes are typically 50 to 60 % of those for a completely open tube. The effects of the perforation area on drawdown and transient drainage rates are smaller than on drainage rates under ponded conditions (Skaggs, 1978). However, the effect may still be important. Some tubing companies advertise the advantages of large perforation areas. Agencies such as the US Soil Conservation Service (1977) and the Bureau of Reclamation (1978) require a minimum water entry area of 21 cm 2 /m. While there have been theoretical studies {{of the effect of}} perforations on transient state drainage (Skaggs and Tang, 1979), there are limited experimental studies of these effects.

40|$|Revenue {{management}} (RM) principles {{can apply}} to casino table games {{just as they do}} many other service industry operations. Creating a sound and feasible RM model for casinos relies foremost on the ability to create a demand forecast that accounts for the intermittent demand patterns of casino table games. Using a modified Croston's approach to forecast demand, this article proposes a revenue optimization model to help managers determine how many tables to open and what limits to set. Empirical tests of historical data for hourly demand at blackjack tables in a casino in Ontario, Canada, show that the theoretical win amounts derived using RM applications exceeded the theoretical win actually recorded by the casino. By recording players' betting patterns and speed of play, the casino industry should be able to use this model to improve on the current practice of <b>opening</b> and closing <b>tables</b> according to intuition and historic demand patterns.

30|$|Moderate opening rate: For {{the same}} {{driving force of}} grain growth as the {{previous}} case, the prescribed crack <b>opening</b> rate (in <b>Table</b> 2) lies between the maximum and minimum potential growth rate. Different stages of synkinematic cementation are shown in Fig. 4 c. In the initial stages, due to the availability of sufficient pore space, the growth competition between the neighboring crystals of the same crack surface is dominant. It is noteworthy that since the aspect ratio of the chosen 2 D equilibrium shape of calcite is close to unity, the orientation selection {{is more or less}} random. Therefore, the fastest growing crystals are decided on the basis of neighboring grain interactions. As the cementation progresses, the crystals begin to form bridges (at t =  2660 in Fig. 4 c), so that the further growth is constrained by the crystals growing from the opposite crack surface resulting in partially open veins (at t =  4935 in Fig. 4 c). At later stages, the pore space is entirely filled with bitaxial crystal growth leading to elongate-blocky vein textures with increasing width {{along the length of the}} crystals (at t =  11935 in Fig. 4 c, f).|$|R

The scene shifts to the woman from the beginning (the brunette) carrying furniture through a forest. Back at the table, she disappears, and becomes replaced with a male band member, wearing similar clothing to hers. As the video goes on, the blonde is shown riding through the forest in a carriage driven by a hooded figure in black, also disappearing from the table and being replaced by a band member in similar clothing. The same thing happens to the redhead, who is shown constrained underwater in an algae-like fashion, and the raven-haired woman, who appears to be in a small boat in a lake, calling out for someone.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{composite}} beams with large rectangular or circular openings {{is an important}} structural and practical problem which {{is caused by the}} need to pass service ducts through the structural zone of floor systems. Careful sizing and positioning of these openings in the beam webs can minimise their adverse effects on the shear and the bending resistances of composite beams. A design method [1][Lawson, RM. Design for openings in the webs of composite beams. The Steel Construction Institute/CIRIA joint publication SCI-P 068, 1987. ] for composite beams with large web openings was first formulated in accordance with BS 5950 and calibrated against full-scale tests in 1992 [2][Lawson RM, Chung KF, Price AM. Tests on composite beams with large web openings to justify existing design methods. Struct Eng 1992 : 70 (1). ]. With the release of the draft Eurocode 4 in 1994 [3][ENV 1994 - 1 - 1 : Eurocode 4 : design of composite steel and concrete structures. BSI, 1994. ], this paper re-presents the design method in the format of application rules to Eurocode 4 for detailed design of composite beams with large web openings. Moreover, the designer needs advice at the scheme design stage, and this paper also presents general information on sizing of openings {{as a function of the}} utilisation of the shear and the bending resistances of composite beams. Furthermore, the effect of these openings on deflections is estimated by a simple factor which is dependent on the size and the location of the <b>openings.</b> Typical design <b>tables</b> for composite beams with large rectangular openings are presented.

USE empl REPLACE ALL salary WITH salary * 1.1 FOR supervisors > 0 LIST ALL fname, lname, salary TO PRINT * (comment: reserved words shown in CAPITALS for illustration purposes)Note how {{one does not have}} to keep mentioning the table name. The assumed ("current") table stays the same until told otherwise. Because of its origins as an interpreted interactive language, dBase used a variety of contextual techniques {{to reduce the amount of}} typing needed. This facilitated incremental, interactive development but also made larger-scale modular programming difficult. A tenet of modular programming is that the correct execution of a program module must not be affected by external factors such as the state of memory variables or tables being manipulated in other program modules. Because dBase was not designed with this in mind, developers had to be careful about porting (borrowing) programming code that assumed a certain context and it would make writing larger-scale modular code difficult. Work-area-specific references were still possible using the arrow notation ("B->customer") so that multiple tables could be manipulated at the same time. In addition, if the developer had the foresight to name their tables appropriately, they could clearly refer to a large number of tables open at the same time by notation such as ("employee->salary") and ("vacation->start_date"). Alternatively, the alias command could be appended to the initial <b>opening</b> of a <b>table</b> statement which made referencing a table field unambiguous and simple. For example. one can open a table and assign an alias to it in this fashion, [...] "use EMP alias Employee", and henceforth, refer to table variables as [...] "Employee->Name".|$|R

60|$|In {{the early}} green stage at which coco-nuts are {{generally}} picked for household {{use in the}} tropics the shell hasn't yet solidified into a hard stony coat, but still remains quite soft enough to be readily cut through with a sharp table knife--just like young walnuts picked for pickling. If you cut one across while it's in this unsophisticated state, it is easy {{enough to see the}} arrangement of the interior, and the part borne by the milk in the development and growth of the mature nut. The ordinary tropical way of <b>opening</b> coco-nuts for <b>table,</b> indeed, is by cutting {{off the top of the}} shell and rind in successive slices, at the end where the three pores are situated, until you reach the level of the water, which fills up the whole interior. The nutty part around the inside of the shell is then extremely soft and jelly-like, so that it can be readily eaten with a spoon; but as a matter of fact very few people ever do eat the flesh at all. After their first few months in the tropics, they lose the taste for this comparatively indigestible part, and confine themselves entirely (like patients at a German spa) to drinking the water. A young coco-nut is thus seen to consist, first of a green outer skin, then of a fibrous coat, which afterwards becomes the hair, and next of a harder shell which finally gets quite woody; while inside all comes the actual seed or unripe nut itself. The office of the coco-nut water is the deposition of the nutty part around the side of the shell; it is, so to speak, the mother liquid, from which the harder eatable portion is afterwards derived. This state is not uncommon in embryo seeds. In a very young pea, for example, the inside is quite watery, and only the outer skin is at all solid, as we have all observed when green peas first come into season. But the special peculiarity of the coco-nut consists in the fact that this liquid condition of the interior continues even after the nut is ripe, and that is the really curious point about the milk in the coco-nut which does actually need accounting for.|$|R
