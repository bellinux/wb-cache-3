Several sites for dams were identified including Siah Bisheh as a potential place for a pumped-storage power plant. In 1975, a feasibility report on the Siah Bisheh project was submitted to the Ministry of Energy. The Albors Mountains study concluded in 1977 and geologic studies began in 1978 but were halted in 1979 due to the Iranian Revolution. In 1983, Lahmeyer International was contracted to create designs for Phase II (underground excavation) which were completed in 1985, the same year construction on the dam's diversion tunnels began. Further designs for Phase I (superstructures) were developed and construction continued until 1992 when a lack of funding halted the project once again. Construction would not commence again until 2001. In 2002 and 2003, contracts for the dams and power plant were awarded and construction continued. The project was 90 percent complete as of April 2012. Both {{the upper and lower}} reservoir were complete and had finished impounding in January 2013. The first of four generators was commissioned in May 2013 and the remaining were operational by 1 September 2015.|$|E
500|$|Liberty {{ships were}} {{a type of}} cargo ship with a uniform design {{intended}} to be quickly built for wartime needs during World War II. In general, Liberty ships were named after famous Americans, and Timothy Bloodworth was named for Timothy Bloodworth, a teacher and statesman from North Carolina. The ship was the 44th of 188 Liberty ships built by Delta Shipbuilding Company of New Orleans. Timothy Bloodworth ( [...] hull number 1033) was laid down on 2 February 1943 on [...] number 8. She was launched on 17 March after spending 41 days on the ways. Timothy Bloodworth was completed on 22 April, after 36 days fitting <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> Her total construction time from keel laying to delivery was 77 days.|$|E

50|$|The park is {{most often}} visited in the summer season. Many {{families}} use the facilities for various events such as barbecues, picnics, fireworks, recreational activities, etc. <b>On</b> Independence Day, <b>the</b> park is full of visitors there to watch the show of fireworks. The clear setting of the lake provides a beautiful backdrop to the fireworks show. During the summer the pool is open for swimming, {{as well as the}} lake. Many boats and fishing equipment can be seen <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> in <b>the</b> summer season.|$|R

2500|$|However, other {{competing}} teams, including South Africa, {{reported no}} such illness. Daily water quality tests were being carried <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> of the pools, as {{mandated by the}} event standards. Additional tests were ordered after news of the illnesses, but they also did not find anything amiss. The Australian team's chief doctor, Peter Harcourt, ruled that the [...] "chances of the [...] pool being {{the cause of the}} problem is very remote" [...] and praised the hygiene and food quality in the Delhi Games Village. He suggested that it could be a common case of Traveler's diarhoea (locally called Delhi belly), or the Australian swimmers could have contracted the stomach virus during their training camp in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. English Olympic and Commonwealth gold-medalist swimmer Rebecca Adlington said that the water quality was absolutely fine.|$|E

2500|$|The train {{reaches the}} north shore of Jasper Lake and rides along it for several miles. The Yellowhead Highway rides along the south shore of the lake. The lake is a shallow, wide section of the Athabasca River. This has been the site of many CN {{publicity}} photographs—including of the Super Continental—through the years, and it is still popular with photographers, railfans, the present-day Canadian and its advertisers and passengers. The Jasper Lake Sand Dunes are on the northwest shore of Jasper Lake and {{can be seen from the}} train. They are the only sand dunes eco-system in the Canadian Rockies. Parts of the mainline have been built on causeways away from the shore, which have created several mini lakes. This adds to the effect of being <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> creating additional views of the lake, its waters and the forests and mountains surrounding it. The lake is surrounded by mountain ranges, many of which can be seen the train from various places along the lake. They include: ...|$|E
60|$|She turned. In {{that hour}} {{she remembered that}} great good-natured man, her mother's brother, and for his sake Colonel Carvel had put up with much from his wife's sister in-law. She could pass over, but never forgive what her aunt had said to her that afternoon. Mrs. Colfax had often been cruel before, and inconsiderate. But as the girl thought of <b>the</b> speech, staring <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters,</b> it {{suddenly}} {{occurred to her that}} no lady would have uttered it. In all her life she had never realized till now that her aunt was not a lady. From that time forth Virginia's attitude toward her aunt was changed.|$|R

50|$|The port was {{the last}} place to be {{evacuated}} by the US Army, only days before Khmer Rouge guerrillas {{took control of the}} government in April 1975. The events surrounding the taking of the US container ship SS Mayaguez and its crew on 12 May by the Khmer Rouge and the subsequent rescue operation by US Marines played <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of Koh Tang off the coast of Sihanoukville. During the two days of action, the US commenced air strikes <b>on</b> targets <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mainland of Sihanoukville including the port, the Ream Naval Base, an airfield, the railroad yard and the petroleum refinery in addition to strikes and naval gun fire on several islands.|$|R
60|$|A voice, sweettoned and sustained, {{called to}} him from the sea. Turning the curve he waved his hand. It called again. A sleek brown head, a seal's, far <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> round.|$|E
60|$|The Skimmer {{showed no}} {{yielding}} of the nerves {{though it was}} evident, by his attitude of thought and the momentary fixedness of his eye, that he foresaw danger was near.

60|$|But don't {{be afraid}} for him. He {{is bound to}} run risks and {{encounter}} accidents. Remember, there are accidents in the nursery as well as <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> More boys have died from hot-house culture than have died on boats large and small; and more boys have been made into strong and reliant men by boat-sailing than by lawn-croquet and dancing-school.|$|E
60|$|Tarzan {{watched the}} graceful {{movements}} of the ship in rapt admiration, and longed to be aboard her.

60|$|The {{storm had}} kept up without intermission, the rain coming {{down in a}} perfect torrent, and the wind blowing in fitful gusts from the east.

60|$|And {{this was}} a sample of their gratitude, she thought. It looked as if Sheldon had been right after all. Aroa waited stolidly. A leaping fish splashed far <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> A tiny wavelet murmured sleepily on the beach. The shadow of a flying-fox drifted by in velvet silence overhead. A light air fanned coolly on her cheek; it was the land-breeze {{beginning}} to blow.|$|E
60|$|Grief held {{steadily}} {{along the}} Broom Road, which curved and twisted through a lush growth {{of flowers and}} fern-like algarobas. The warm air was rich with perfume, and overhead, outlined against the stars, were fruit-burdened mangoes, stately avocado trees, and slender-tufted palms. Every here and there were grass houses. Voices and laughter rippled through the darkness. <b>Out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> flickering lights and soft-voiced choruses marked the fishers returning from the reef.|$|E
60|$|Without {{adventure}} {{we crossed}} the United States to California. When the train stopped at Sixteenth Street Station, in Oakland, we alighted, and there Felice Van Verdighan, with her two maids, her lap-dog, and her lap-dog's maid, disappeared forever. The maids, guided by trusty comrades, were led away. Other comrades took charge of me. Within half an hour after leaving the train I was on board a small fishing boat and <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of San Francisco Bay. The winds baffled, and we drifted aimlessly {{the greater part of}} the night. But I saw the lights of Alcatraz where Ernest lay, and found comfort in the thought of nearness to him. By dawn, what with the rowing of the fishermen, we made the Marin Islands. Here we lay in hiding all day, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> following night, swept on by a flood tide and a fresh wind, we crossed San Pablo Bay in two hours and ran up Petaluma Creek.|$|R
25|$|The fire {{caused by}} the initial {{explosion}} took eight days to burn out, making it hard for firefighters to board the tanker and stop the leakage of oil. However, the fire was helpful {{in the fact that}} it functioned as a natural in situ burning – out of the over 4.6 million spilled gallons, only 12,000 to 40,000 were left after the fire had burned <b>out</b> both <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tanker.|$|R

60|$|Oh, I skip much of {{the details}} of my {{trafficking}} with John Barleycorn during this period, and shall only mention events that will throw light on John Barleycorn's ways. There were three things that enabled me to pursue this heavy drinking: first, a magnificent constitution far better than the average; second, the healthy open-air life on the water; and third, the fact that I drank irregularly. While <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> we never carried any drink along.|$|E
60|$|One morning, the Swift One {{not having}} {{put in an}} appearance, Lop-Ear and I were down {{at the mouth of}} the slough playing on the logs. We had {{scarcely}} got <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> when we were startled by a roar of rage. It was Red-Eye. He was crouching on the edge of the timber jam and glowering his hatred at us. We were badly frightened, for here was no narrow-mouthed cave for refuge. But the twenty feet of water that intervened gave us temporary safety, and we plucked up courage.|$|E
60|$|In {{the winter}} season, as I have said, we were much quieter than in summer, for then the rowing men almost all {{went away to}} London till the spring; but twice a week at any rate we went in of an evening to the Planters', {{or one of the}} other {{resident}} families, or they came in to us. Saturday was the club-day, and then Harry went <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> when the weather was fine, and in the evening to the club-room, where he boxed, fenced, and played whist till twelve o'clock.|$|E

However, it soon turns foggy, and Mainwaring decides to turn round. It isn't long before Mainwaring takes charge completely, and Frazer goes into a sulk.|$|R

Now I shall be able to rely on finding Beppo asleep in the boat at the steps. In future, since you have a boat of your own, I shall not be so particular as to your being in at ten. I do not so much mind your being <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> only you must promise me that you will not be in the streets after that hour. There are frequent broils as the evening gets on, not to mention the danger of cutthroats in unfrequented lanes; but if you will promise me that you will never be about the streets after half past nine, I will give you leave to stay <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> till a later hour; but when you come in late be careful always to close and bar the door, and do not make more noise than you can help in coming up to your room." ...|$|E

60|$|On {{the first}} morning of my fourth summer, 1917, I was up at five. Fine, cool, fresh, soft dawn with a pale pink sunrise. Sea {{rippling}} with an easterly breeze. As the sun rose it grew bright and warm. We did not get started <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> until eight o'clock. The east wind had whipped up a little chop that promised bad. But the wind gradually died down and the day became hot. Great thunderheads rose over the mainland, proclaiming heat on the desert. We saw scattered sheerwater ducks and a school of porpoises; also a number of splashes that I was sure were made by swordfish.|$|E
