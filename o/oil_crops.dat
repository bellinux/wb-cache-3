2500|$|Oil price {{increases}} since 2003 resulted in {{increased demand for}} biofuels. [...] Transforming vegetable oil into biodiesel is not very hard or costly {{so there is a}} profitable arbitrage situation if vegetable oil is much cheaper than diesel. [...] Diesel is also made from crude oil, so vegetable oil prices are partially linked to crude oil prices. [...] Farmers can switch to growing vegetable <b>oil</b> <b>crops</b> if those are more profitable than food crops. So all food prices are linked to vegetable oil prices, and in turn to crude oil prices. A World Bank study concluded that oil prices and a weak dollar explain 25–30% of total price rise between January 2002 until June 2008.|$|E
2500|$|In {{comparison}} with terrestrial-based biofuel {{crops such as}} corn or soybeans, microalgal production results in a much less significant land footprint due to the higher oil productivity from the microalgae than all other <b>oil</b> <b>crops.</b> [...] Algae can also be grown on marginal lands useless for ordinary crops and with low conservation value, and can use water from salt aquifers that is not useful for agriculture or drinking. Algae can also grow {{on the surface of}} the ocean in bags or floating screens. Thus microalgae could provide a source of clean energy with little impact on the provisioning of adequate food and water or the conservation of biodiversity. Algae cultivation also requires no external subsidies of insecticides or herbicides, removing any risk of generating associated pesticide waste streams. [...] In addition, algal biofuels are much less toxic, and degrade far more readily than petroleum-based fuels. [...] However, due to the flammable nature of any combustible fuel, there is potential for some environmental hazards if ignited or spilled, as may occur in a train derailment or a pipeline leak. [...] This hazard is reduced compared to fossil fuels, due to the ability for algal biofuels to be produced in a much more localized manner, and due to the lower toxicity overall, but the hazard is still there nonetheless. [...] Therefore, algal biofuels should be treated in a similar manner to petroleum fuels in transportation and use, with sufficient safety measures in place at all times.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: A {{variety of}} biomass {{plantations}} {{are being raised}} for energy production. This case study is on energy production potential of seasonal <b>oil</b> bearing <b>crops</b> in India. These crops {{have the advantage of}} producing oil (liquid fuel) as well as biomass as agro residue (solid fuel). The purpose of the study is to estimate total energy yields of <b>oil</b> bearing <b>crops</b> and compare with other types of energy plantations. Also <b>oil</b> bearing <b>crops</b> bioaccumulate metals and thus phytoremediate soil. This provides scope for waste water irrigation. Design/methodology/approach: Relevant published papers on energy production by raising <b>oil</b> bearing <b>crops</b> have been analyzed. The effect of waste water irrigation and agronomic practices on increasing productivity is given special attention. Findings: It is shown that the seasonal <b>oil</b> bearing <b>crops</b> such as castor have a high potential to generate energy and this is comparable to energy produced by many perennial grasses. The energy yields of castor under irrigated condition was 196 × 103 MJ/ha and this is comparable to the reed canary grass which yields 195 × 103 MJ/ha. Some of the <b>oil</b> bearing <b>crops</b> are also super accumulators of certain toxic metals. Research limitations/implications: In this study, only all the accessible papers on the topic could be analyzed. Practical implications: This case study indicates that raising <b>oil</b> bearing <b>crops</b> such as castor using waste water has many advantages which include high energy yields, utilization of waste water for productive purpose and phytoremediation of soil. Originality/value: The comparison made between various types of energy crops for their energy generation is an original contribution. Findings of economic and environmental benefits by waste water irrigation are also of value...|$|R

40|$|With dwindling {{available}} agricultural land, concurrent {{with increased}} demand for oil, there is much current interest in raising <b>oil</b> <b>crop</b> productivity. We have been addressing this issue by studying the regulation of oil accumulation in oilseed rape (Brassica napus L). As part of this research we have carried out a detailed lipidomic analysis of developing seeds. The molecular species distribution in individual lipid classes revealed quite distinct patterns and showed where metabolic connections were important. As the seeds developed, the molecular species distributions changed, especially {{in the period of}} early (20 days after flowering, DAF) to mid phase (27 DAF) of oil accumulation. The patterns of molecular species of diacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine and acyl-CoAs were used to predict the possible relative contributions of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) and phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase to triacylglycerol production. Our calculations suggest that DGAT may hold a more important role in influencing the molecular composition of TAG. Enzyme selectivity had an important influence on the final molecular species patterns. Our data contribute significantly to our understanding of lipid accumulation in the world’s third most important <b>oil</b> <b>crop...</b>|$|R
