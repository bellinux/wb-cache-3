5|$|Although {{the arms}} of the encirclement had now made contact, the Allies were not yet astride Seventh Army's escape route in any great {{strength}} and their positions came under frenzied assault. During the day an armoured column from the 2nd Panzer Division broke through the Canadians in St. Lambert, capturing half the village and maintaining an <b>open</b> <b>road</b> for six hours until being forced out. Many Germans escaped along this route and numerous small parties infiltrated on foot through to the River Dives during the night.|$|E
5|$|If one interprets each 1-cell in Rule 184 as {{containing}} a particle, these particles behave {{in many ways}} similarly to automobiles in a single lane of traffic: they move forward at a constant speed if there is open space in front of them, and otherwise they stop. Traffic models such as Rule 184 and its generalizations that discretize both space and time are commonly called particle-hopping models. Although very primitive, the Rule 184 model of traffic flow already predicts some of the familiar emergent features of real traffic: clusters of freely moving cars separated by stretches of <b>open</b> <b>road</b> when traffic is light, and waves of stop-and-go traffic when it is heavy.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{most other}} toll highways, Highway 407 {{features}} no toll booths. Rather, {{a system of}} cameras and transponders allows for automatic toll collection. It {{is one of the}} earliest examples of a highway to exclusively use <b>open</b> <b>road</b> tolling. Highway407 is otherwise designed as a normal freeway; interchanges connect directly to surface streets. A radio antenna detects when a vehicle with a transponder has entered and exited the highway, calculating the toll rate. For vehicles without a transponder, an automatic number plate recognition system is used. In both cases, monthly statements are mailed to users. The automatic number plate recognition system is linked to several provincial and U.S. state motor vehicle registries.|$|E

40|$|The {{impacts of}} roads on {{wildlife}} are extensive {{and can be}} especially harmful on U. S. National Forest lands where ecosystems are relatively intact. Access allowed by wildland roads can increase poaching, over-hunting, and over-trapping. Roads also increase negative edge effects, cause fragmentation, and facilitate or hinder wildlife movement. Forest Service managers are removing some roads to mitigate these impacts on wildlife, but few studies have addressed {{the effectiveness of this}} strategy. In this study, we tested if wildlife were using decommissioned roads more than adjacent <b>open</b> <b>roads.</b> The study was conducted on the Clearwater National Forest in the Bitterroot Mountains of north-central Idaho where they have removed and revegetated more than 500 mi of roads. From May to October 2006 we monitored wildlife use on <b>open</b> and decommissioned <b>roads</b> using remotely-triggered cameras and baited track plates. Wildlife monitoring {{was part of a larger}} citizen monitoring program where a trained volunteer coordinator lead trips into the field each week to collect data on decommissioned roads. Using t-tests, we compared the number of detections and rates of detection between <b>open</b> and decommissioned <b>roads.</b> Remotely-triggered cameras detected mammals at a higher rate on decommissioned <b>roads</b> than <b>open</b> <b>roads</b> for all species. However, on track plates there were about the same number of detections on <b>open</b> and decommissioned <b>roads.</b> Overall, we could not statistically distinguish the rate of detection between <b>open</b> and closed <b>roads</b> for white-tailed deer, elk, moose, and coyotes. Black bear, however, had a significantly higher rate of detection on removed <b>roads</b> than <b>open</b> <b>roads</b> (p<. 01). This finding is consistent with several studies that have found that bears avoid <b>open</b> <b>roads.</b> While the sample size was small, this study is the first to demonstrate with statistical significance that road decommissioning is restoring habitat for bears. This summer we will increase our sampling efforts to help reduce variability and test if the level of security influences rates of detection. More research is needed to fully understand the effects of road removal on wildlife and their habitat...|$|R
