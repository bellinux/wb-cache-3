5|$|Due {{partly to}} the limited success <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>latest</b> book outside Indiana, Riley was persuaded to begin working with other midwestern writers to attempt to form an {{association}} to promote their work. Popular Indiana writer Lew Wallace, author of , was a major promoter of the effort. During 1885, {{more than one hundred}} writers joined the group. They held their first meeting in July, naming themselves the Western Association of Writers. At the meeting Maurice Thompson was named president, and Riley vice president. The association never succeeded in its goals of creating a powerful advertising force, but became a social club and a rival literary community to the eastern writing establishment. Riley was disappointed with the shortcomings of the group, but came to depend on its regular meetings as a escape from his normally hectic schedule.|$|E

5|$|Sy Sperling, the {{president}} of hair restoration company Hair Club for Men, appeared in the ring before the next match. He {{announced that he was}} at WrestleMania to introduce one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>latest</b> clients, ring announcer Howard Finkel. Finkel came to the ring wearing a toupée, showing off his new hair while the crowd applauded. The match then began, as Bam Bam Bigelow and Luna Vachon came to the ring to face Doink the Clown and Dink. Bigelow attacked Doink {{at the beginning of the}} match with a dropkick and a powerslam. When Dink entered the match, the rules stated that Bigelow had to tag Vachon into the match. Dink ran around the ring avoiding Vachon, but she eventually caught him. She kicked him and powerslammed him, but she then missed a moonsault attempt. Doink and Bigelow re-entered the match, and Doink performed a DDT on Bigelow. Bigelow reversed the momentum to win the match after a diving headbutt on Doink. Bigelow pinned Doink to win the match, and he and Vachon then attacked Dink.|$|E

25|$|Frederick {{resigned}} as Commander-in-Chief on 25 March 1809, {{as the result}} of a scandal caused by the activities <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>latest</b> mistress, Mary Anne Clarke. Clarke was accused of illicitly selling army commissions under Frederick's aegis. A select committee of the House of Commons enquired into the matter. Parliament eventually acquitted Frederick of receiving bribes by 278 votes to 196. He nevertheless resigned because of the high tally against him. Two years later, it was revealed that Clarke had received payment from Frederick's disgraced chief accuser, Gwyllym Wardle, and the Prince Regent reappointed the exonerated Frederick as Commander-in-Chief on 29 May 1811.|$|E
25|$|Jung {{was thirty}} {{when he sent}} his Studies in Word Association to Sigmund Freud in Vienna in 1906.

He recalled that they talked almost unceasingly for thirteen hours. Six months later, the then 50-year-old Freud sent a collection <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>latest</b> published essays to Jung in Zurich. This marked the beginning of an intense correspondence and collaboration that lasted six years and ended in May 1913. At that time Jung resigned as the chairman of the International Psychoanalytical Association, a position to which he had been elected with Freud's support.|$|E

When it closed, she assumed Lillie's role on tour, then returned to London once again to understudy the star in another Charlot production, where she met dance director Francis Gordon-Howley. Although he was twenty years her senior, the two wed and soon after had a daughter Pamela, Lawrence's only child. The marriage was not a success, and Lawrence took Pamela with her to her mother's home in Clapham. The couple remained separated but did not divorce until ten years later.|$|E
25|$|Evangelisti's {{novels are}} greatly {{appreciated}} in France (where he won several literary awards), Spain, Germany and Portugal. He {{is currently the}} director of the Carmilla magazine. In the last years he has written some works which show his love for heavy metal music, namely the short stories collection Metallo urlante (referring to the French magazine Metal Hurlant) and the novels Black Flag and Antracite: they are set during the American Civil War and feature a new character, Pantera, a palero shaman. One <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>latest</b> novels, Noi saremo tutto ("We Shall Be All"), spans several decades of the last century, exploring the life of Eddie Florio, a gangster, against the background {{of the history of the}} trade unions and the workers' battles for civil rights.|$|E
25|$|His {{last years}} were saddened not merely {{by the death}} of many of his closest friends, but by {{increasing}} ill-health. This did not interfere with the quality of his literary work; he was rarely idle and some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>latest</b> work is among his best. But he indulged the temptation to alter his work repeatedly, and many of his later alterations are not improvements. Towards the end of 1585 his health deteriorated, and he seems to have moved restlessly from one of his houses to another for some months. When the end came, which, though in great pain, he met in a resolute and religious manner, he was at his priory of Saint-Cosme in Touraine, and he was buried in the church of that name on Friday, 27 December 1585.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, Sir Thomas Mitchell's {{discovery}} of fossil bones, in New South Wales, provided {{material for the}} first of Owen's long series of papers on the extinct mammals of Australia, which were eventually reprinted in book-form in 1877. He discovered Diprotodon (1838) and Thylacoleo (1859), besides extinct kangaroos and wombats, of gigantic size. While occupied with so much material from abroad, Owen was also busily collecting facts for an exhaustive work on similar fossils from the British Isles and, in 1844–1846, he published his History of British Fossil Mammals and Birds, which was followed by many later memoirs, notably his Monograph of the Fossil Mammalia of the Mesozoic Formations (Palaeont. Soc., 1871). One <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>latest</b> publications was a little work entitled Antiquity of Man as deduced from the Discovery of a Human Skeleton during Excavations of the Docks at Tilbury (London, 1884).|$|E
25|$|McGeer {{returned}} to civic politics with another landslide election victory in 1946, {{this time on}} a Non-Partisan Association slate. Again he ran on a campaign to rid the city of vice and police corruption. Ill-health made him less exuberant than his earlier mayoral term, but he nonetheless persisted with his reforms. Twenty-six men on the police force were demoted or dismissed and the chief constable was replaced by Walter Mulligan, who was the youngest chief in Vancouver to date. McGeer died in office in 1947 and therefore {{did not see the}} fruits <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>latest</b> reform drive. In 1955, revelations surfaced that McGeer's chosen police chief had instituted a pay-off system in Vancouver, resulting in an extensive police inquiry. Mulligan fled the country, one high-ranking member of the force committed suicide, and another attempted suicide. Meanwhile, a Superintendent from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police took over as the new chief.|$|E
25|$|To {{make matters}} worse, at {{a late night}} party and jam session during the {{recording}} of the album, attended by Lennon, McCartney, Danny Kortchmar, and other musicians, Nilsson ruptured a vocal cord, but he hid the injury for fear that Lennon would call {{a halt to the}} production. The resulting album was Pussy Cats. In an effort to clean up, Lennon, Nilsson and Ringo Starr first rented a house together, then Lennon and Nilsson left for New York. After the relative failure <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>latest</b> two albums, RCA Records considered dropping Nilsson's contract. In a show of friendship, Lennon accompanied Nilsson to negotiations, and both intimated to RCA that Lennon and Starr might want to sign with them, once their Apple Records contracts with EMI expired in 1975, but would not be interested if Nilsson were no longer with the label. RCA took the hint and re-signed Nilsson (adding a bonus clause, to apply to each new album completed), but neither Lennon nor Starr signed with RCA.|$|E
