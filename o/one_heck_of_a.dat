IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 9.2/10, writing that it [...] "is {{a classic example}} of a story you have to be patient with. This was an episode with a compelling, {{shocking}} start that kept us hooked well enough to deal with some slow points {{in the rest of the}} first half-hour. But we were rewarded for our patience with <b>one</b> <b>heck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> climax and epilogue. This was well-executed TV". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times thought that while the first half wasn't very exciting, the second half had [...] "plenty to keep up interest" [...] as more was revealed about Olivia and Walter's backgrounds.|$|E
500|$|There was {{a strong}} {{reaction}} from the show's viewers. Adler said, [...] "I've heard {{from a lot of}} fans how important this character is for them because it's important to watch the internal struggle, the confusion and the torture one person can put themselves through being closeted." [...] He wants Karofsky to [...] "accept himself and come out because [...] it would be a beacon of hope for everyone else who's struggling", and noted, [...] "people do get hope from Glee." [...] He also said, [...] "I think [...] trusts me to do what I'm doing with the character, which is <b>one</b> <b>heck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> compliment from him." [...] Murphy has indicated a preference for positive future developments, and said in early January 2011, [...] "This show is by nature optimistic and I think a character like Karofsky could turn to booze or pills or alcohol and kill themselves or do something dark. But I also love Max and I love that character and I sorta want that character to have a happy ending." [...] At one point in the bullying storyline, Karofsky threatens to kill Kurt, a scene that Adler characterized as [...] "very powerful. Chilling, terrifying, horrifying, yet, at the same time, heartbreaking. … Because there are kids who have messaged me since that episode saying they used to hear that line spoken to them {{day in and day out}} at school", and they dreaded school because of it.|$|E

Instead, she's strutting her stuff with neon makeup and costumes straight out of the Day-Glo '90s." [...] Nakisha Williams of BET praised the [...] "flashy looks Beyoncé chose to get her 'Party' on". Sarah Anne Hughes of The Washington Post praised the [...] "pretty glamorous trailer park affair" [...] and the party in the video saying that it's a [...] "party you wish you were invited to." [...] A writer of VH1 found a [...] "delectable, candy-colored, bling-adorned party scene" [...] with [...] "retro-ghetto fab outfits" [...] and a very simple throughline.|$|E
500|$|Pre-release {{reviews of}} the miniseries were largely {{positive}}. Zack Smith of Newsarama gave the miniseries a largely positive review and called it [...] "fan service writ large, one that will prove immensely satisfying for long-term fans of the series". He applauded the way the string of episodes managed to start out with self-contained stories and move into a dense and emotional backstory. Tonally, Smith described the miniseries as possessing [...] "the feel <b>of</b> <b>an</b> old-school post-apocalyptic SF sagaa journey through a devastated-but-wondrous world, with <b>a</b> sense <b>of</b> danger and mystery detached from the Land of Ooo." [...] Smith's only complaint was that [...] "there's enough rich emotional material once the voyagers reach their destination that it feels like more time could be spent there". Matthew Jacobson of The Spectrum wrote that [...] "the story is masterful and imaginative" [...] and that [...] "if Islands is a litmus test, then the final season should be <b>one</b> <b>heck</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> adventure." ...|$|R
500|$|Stephen also {{commented on}} the feud, opining that while [...] "Mercedes and Mitzeee are hardly Dynasty's Alexis and Krystle, they are enjoying quite a good spat".

Siege victim, kidnap victim, depressive, stalker..." [...] Stephen urged Mercedes to realise that [...] "there are other guys in the world apart from Riley. True, you've had them all, but you could simply start going round the circuit again". She added that Mercedes does not have much to lose in her life. After her stalking of Mitzeee, Mercedes went on to stab herself, on this Carena Crawford of All About Soap said the episode itself was a [...] "huge shocker" [...] due to Mercedes' actions. Crawford added that when Mercedes realises she will be blamed for knocking Mitzeee unconscious she sees the knife and [...] "mad Mercedes {{came up with the}} perfect plan and we winced as she plunged the blade into her own stomach, knowing everyone would think Mitzeee did it! So now manipulative Mercedes has the upper hand over her rival [...] After all, who’d suspect anyone of stabbing themselves – very few people are warped enough to do that".|$|R
40|$|It {{is not an}} {{understatement}} to say that V 838 Mon is <b>one</b> <b>heck</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> enigmatic object. It underwent a powerful eruptive outburst in Jan. 2002, increasing in luminosity by <b>a</b> factor <b>of</b> 100 over <b>a</b> period <b>of</b> 3 months. Immediately following this event, a spectacular light echo was formed from the outburst light reflecting off the surrounding dust; this has been beautifully followed by Hubble Space Telescope imaging. What makes V 838 Mon an unusual star is that the outburst is not of any type heretofore seen. The theories that best explain the outburst are a giant star engulfing a planetary system, or a merger between two low-mass stars. To date, observations {{have shown that the}} envelope of the star expanded in response to the stellar impact, and than it may now be beginning to contract. Many O-bearing molecules, dust, an SiO maser and possibly a jet have been observed from the star. Spitzer imaging has shown dust surrounding the star, and has shown that new dust was forming right around the star itself. We obtained Herschel (SPIRE, PACS, and HIFI) data on V 838 Mon, with the aim of seeing {{what was going on with}} the dust forming around the star, and to see if this new dust, and the older surrounding dust, were changing with time. We also wanted to see what was happening in the expanded stellar atmosphere. In this poster we present our results. status: publishe...|$|R

2500|$|Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times {{praises the}} show's ability to [...] "anchor fantasy with vivid and {{recognizable}} human psychology" [...] and declares that {{the series is}} [...] "not just a cult hit but a significant piece of television." [...] Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune describes it as a [...] "sprawling, enthralling tale of human survival" [...] that is [...] "full of political allegories and fascinating, multifaceted characters." [...] She finds, [...] "Like Deadwood, Battlestar Galactica is interested in exploring how a society on the edge decides to govern itself. What rights and actions are sacrosanct, which are outlawed, {{when most of the}} human race is eliminated? ... Thanks to a stellar cast and brave writing, Battlestar soars." [...] Throughout its run, the series has often surprised reviewers with its many twists and turns. Ryan comments: [...] "There’s nothing like a good Battlestar plot twist to make your head spin, but the 'holy cow' moments aren’t the main point (though they’re <b>one</b> <b>heck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tasty side dish). The show and its twists and turns are grounded in deep curiosity about human nature, and how contradictory and confounding it can be." ...|$|E
