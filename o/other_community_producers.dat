40|$|High-throughput {{scientific}} instruments are generating {{massive amounts of}} data. Today, {{one of the main}} challenges faced by researchers is to make the best use of the world 2 ̆ 7 s growing wealth of data. Data (re) usability is becoming a distinct characteristic of modern scientific practice. By data (re) usability, we mean the ease of using data for legitimate scientific research by one or more communities of research (consumer communities) that is produced by <b>other</b> <b>communities</b> of research (<b>producer</b> <b>communities).</b> Data (re) usability allows the reanalysis of evidence, reproduction and verification of results, minimizing duplication of effort, and building on the work of others. It has four main dimensions: policy, legal, economic and technological. The paper addresses the technological dimension of data reusability. The conceptual foundations of data reuse as well as the barriers that hamper data reuse are presented and discussed. The data publication process is proposed as a bridge between the data author and user and the relevant technologies enabling this process are presented...|$|R

Cougar Town creator Bill Lawrence explained, [...] "They had Abed have a love of Cougar Town, we had Travis have a love of Community, and once we got wind of what they were having Abed say he experienced out here, we were going {{to try to find a}} way of Danny being a background character and essentially act that same thing out on our show." [...] Community previously had an episode that featured several shout-outs to Cougar Town. The mutual admiration between the two shows started as Cougar Town creators Bill Lawrence and Kevin Biegel became friends with Community creator Dan Harmon, and would often tweet each <b>other.</b> Also, <b>Community</b> executive <b>producers</b> Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan previously worked with Lawrence on Scrubs for several years.|$|R
