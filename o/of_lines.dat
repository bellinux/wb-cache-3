5|$|A {{transmission}} line {{is required to}} bring the generated power to (often remote) markets. For an off-shore station this may require a submarine cable. Construction of a new high-voltage line may be too costly for the wind resource alone, but wind sites may take advantage <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> installed for conventionally fueled generation.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} advent of printing, the visual {{appearance}} of poetry often added meaning or depth. Acrostic poems conveyed meanings in the initial letters <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> or in letters at other specific places in a poem. In Arabic, Hebrew and Chinese poetry, the visual presentation of finely calligraphed poems has played an important part in the overall effect of many poems.|$|E

This part <b>of</b> <b>line</b> 1A became part <b>of</b> <b>line</b> 5 in April 2009. The station is located in Auderghem.|$|R

5|$|In 2014, Simon & Schuster {{published}} Juliet's Nurse, a {{novel by}} historian and former college professor Lois M. Leveen imagining the fourteen {{years leading up to}} the events in the play {{from the point of view}} of the nurse. The nurse has the third largest number <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> in the original play; only the eponymous characters have more lines.|$|E
5|$|In addition, a {{programme}} of modernising {{many of the}} Underground's busiest central London stations was started; {{providing them}} with escalators to replace lifts. New and refurbished rolling stock was gradually introduced on a number <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> with automatic sliding doors {{along the length of}} the carriages instead of manual end gates, reducing boarding times. By the middle of the 1920s, the organisation had expanded to such an extent that a large, new headquarters building designed by Charles Holden was constructed at 55 Broadway over St. James's Park station.|$|E

5|$|Introduced in HDMI 1.4, HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel (HEAC) adds a {{high-speed}} bidirectional data communication link (HEC) {{and the ability}} to send audio data upstream to the source device (ARC). HEAC utilizes two lines from the connector: the previously unused Reserved pin (called HEAC+) and the Hot Plug Detect pin (called HEAC−). If only ARC transmission is required, a single mode signal using the HEAC+ line can be used, otherwise, HEC is transmitted as a differential signal over the pair <b>of</b> <b>lines,</b> and ARC as a common mode component of the pair.|$|E
5|$|Lines {{of poems}} are often {{organized}} into stanzas, which are denominated {{by the number}} <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> included. Thus a collection of two lines is a couplet (or distich), three lines a triplet (or tercet), four lines a quatrain, and so on. These lines {{may or may not}} relate to each other by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held together by a common meter alone.|$|E
5|$|PONIE is {{an acronym}} for Perl On New Internal Engine. The PONIE Project existed from 2003 until 2006 and {{was to be a}} bridge between Perl 5 and Perl 6. It was an effort to rewrite the Perl 5 {{interpreter}} to run on Parrot, the Perl 6 virtual machine. The goal was to ensure the future of the millions <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> of Perl 5 code at thousands of companies around the world.|$|E

5|$|Poetry {{is often}} {{separated}} into lines on a page. These lines may {{be based on}} the number of metrical feet, or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends <b>of</b> <b>lines.</b> Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone. See the article on line breaks for information about the division between lines.|$|E
5|$|Seven of the calendrical crescents (red) are {{accompanied}} by other glyphs (green). Guy suggests syllabic readings for some of these, based on possible rebuses and correspondences {{with the names of}} the nights in the old calendar. The two sequences of six and five nights without such accompanying glyphs (beginning of line 7, and transition <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> 7–8) correspond to the two groups of six and five numbered kokore nights, which do not have individual names.|$|E
5|$|Stichometry {{existed for}} several reasons. Scribes were {{paid by the}} line and their fee per line was {{sometimes}} fixed by legal decree. Authors occasionally cited passages {{in the works of}} other authors by giving their approximate line number. Book buyers used total line counts to check that copied texts were complete. Library catalogs listed the total number <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> in each work along with the title and author.|$|E

5|$|Streetcars {{service to}} Lynn {{continued}} under the Lynn & Boston until 1901 {{when it became}} part of the Boston & Northern Street Railway.

The Bay State Street Railway took over operations in 1911 and joined the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway in 1919. Trolley service in Lynn lasted until 1938.|$|E
5|$|The Bendigo {{line was}} {{completed}} in 1862, with extensions were opened to Echuca in 1864, and Swan Hill in 1890, followed by a number <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> throughout the north-west corner of the state.

5|$|The {{libraries}} of Europe contain many medieval {{copies of}} ancient Greek and Latin texts. Many of these contain short notes or 'subscriptions' {{on the final}} page that, in hundreds of cases, give the total number <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> in the work. In texts of classical authors such as Herodotus and Demosthenes, these totals are expressed in the older, acrophonic numerals {{that were used in}} Athens during the classical period but abandoned sometime during the Hellenistic period. Thus these stichometric totals are thought to descend, along with the content of the texts, from very early editions.|$|E

A train approaching the town {{on any of the}} lines from the south (except the WLR from Southport) could be routed to enter the station via either the North Union or the East Lancashire line. It was even possible for trains from the north to perform an effective U-turn, a feat sometimes carried out by trains between Scotland and Blackpool that would otherwise have had to reverse.|$|E
