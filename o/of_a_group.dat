50|$|In <b>group</b> theory, <b>a</b> branch <b>of</b> mathematics, <b>a</b> torsion <b>group</b> or <b>a</b> {{periodic}} <b>group</b> is <b>a</b> <b>group</b> {{in which}} each element has finite order.

40|$|It {{is known}} that any {{covering}} space <b>of</b> <b>a</b> topological <b>group</b> has the natural structure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> topological <b>group.</b> This article discusses <b>a</b> noncommutative generalization <b>of</b> this fact. <b>A</b> noncommutative generalization <b>of</b> the topological <b>group</b> is <b>a</b> quantum <b>group.</b> Also there is <b>a</b> noncommutative generalization <b>of</b> <b>a</b> covering.

Marsala briefly battled Austro-Hungarian cruisers during the Battle of the Otranto Straits in May 1917.
