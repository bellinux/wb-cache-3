5|$|Andre Schaeffner, {{a curator}} at the Musée de l'Homme, {{disagreed}} with the Hornbostel-Sachs system and developed his own system in 1932. Schaeffner believed that the pure physics of a musical instrument, rather than its specific construction or playing method, should always determine its classification. (Hornbostel-Sachs, for example, divide aerophones <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> sound production, but membranophones <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> {{the shape of the}} instrument). His system divided instruments into two categories: instruments with solid, vibrating bodies and instruments containing vibrating air.|$|E

5|$|Two other Chroogomphus {{species with}} a {{morphology}} and coloration similar to C.vinicolor include C.rutilus and C.ochraceous.

The other two {{species have been}} separated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> color, with C.ochraceous having brighter colors (yellowish-orange to ochraceous) than C.rutilus. Molecular analyses of European and North American collections suggest that C.rutilus is restricted to Europe, C.ochraceous only occurs in North America, and that cap coloration cannot be reliably used for species determination.|$|E

5|$|According to legend, the Roman King Servius Tullius {{enacted a}} series of {{constitutional}} reforms in the 6th century BC.

This unit, the Tribe, was based on geography rather than family, and was created to assist in future reorganizations of the army. In 471 BC, a law was passed which allowed the Plebeians to begin organizing by Tribe. Before this point, they had organized <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> the Curia. The only difference between the Plebeian Council after 471 BC and the ordinary Tribal Assembly (which also organized <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> the Tribes) was that the Tribes of the Plebeian Council only included Plebeians, whereas the Tribes of the Tribal Assembly included both Plebeians and Patricians.|$|E
