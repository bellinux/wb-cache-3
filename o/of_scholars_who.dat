5|$|Over the years, a {{few people}} have {{questioned}} this version of events. In the early 1980s, two books, one written by Arnold Brackman and another by John Langdon Brooks, even suggested not only {{that there had been}} a conspiracy to rob Wallace of his proper credit, but that Darwin had actually stolen a key idea from Wallace to finish his own theory. These claims have been examined in detail by a number <b>of</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>who</b> have not found them to be convincing. Research into shipping schedules has shown that, contrary to these accusations, Wallace's letter could not have been delivered earlier than the date shown in Darwin's letter to Lyell.|$|E
5|$|At Branga, Shiva {{learns that}} the only person aware of the {{medicine}} recipe is a bandit named Parashuram, who leads a secluded life and kills any man coming near his abode in the jungles. Shiva and his men defeat Parashuram, and to his surprise comes {{to know that he}} is a Vasudev, the group <b>of</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>who</b> have been guiding him on his journey. Parashuram is also surprised to see Shiva as the fabled Neelkanth; in remorse for his actions, he severs his left hand. He gives the recipe of the medicine to the people of Branga and leaves for Kashi with Shiva. At Kashi, Shiva is introduced to Ganesh and Kali by Sati. Shiva recognizes Ganesh as the Naga who tried to attack on Sati and as the killer of Brahaspati. Severely angered, he leaves Sati and takes up residence at the Branga locality. One day, while playing with Kartik at a local park, three lions attack them and Ganesh becomes severely injured while saving Kartik. Shiva forgives him and together with Sati, confronts Daksha, who confesses to murdering Sati's first husband and denouncing Kali and Ganesh. Daksha blames Shiva for causing distrust between him and Sati, who disgusted with Daksha's deeds, asks him to leave Kashi and go back to Meluha.|$|E

25|$|The Limited Mesoamerican Geography Model {{has been}} critiqued {{by a number}} <b>of</b> <b>scholars,</b> <b>who</b> {{suggest that it is}} not an {{adequate}} explanation for Book of Mormon geography and that the locations, events, flora and fauna described in it do not precisely match.

25|$|Nondualist Kashmir Shaivism went {{underground}} for {{a number}} of centuries. While there may have been yogis and practitioners quietly following the teachings, there were no major writers or publications after perhaps the 14th century. In the 20th century Swami Lakshman Joo, himself a Kashmiri Brahmin, helped revive both the scholarly and yogic streams of Kashmir Shaivism. His contribution is enormous. He inspired a generation <b>of</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>who</b> made Kashmir Shaivism a legitimate field of inquiry within the academy.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of the wheellock in Europe can be placed at about 1500. There is a vocal group <b>of</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>who</b> believe Leonardo da Vinci was the inventor. Drawings made by Leonardo of a wheellock mechanism date (depending on the authority) from either the mid-1490s or {{the first decade of}} the 16th century. However, a drawing from a book of German inventions (dated 1505) and a 1507 reference to the purchase of a wheellock in Austria may indicate the inventor was an unknown German mechanic instead.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, a {{consensus}} emerged among historians that {{the entirety of}} the evidence suggests Jefferson's paternity for all of Hemings' children. The Monticello Foundation commissioned its own study, which in 2001 concluded Jefferson was likely the father of Eston Hemings and the other children. Since then the organization has reflected this change in its exhibits, as well as publications about Jefferson and his times. The revelations have stimulated works by a variety <b>of</b> <b>scholars,</b> <b>who</b> have used the new consensus as a basis for studies into Jefferson, the Hemings family, and interracial American society.|$|E

25|$|Under the Aghlabids (9th century), huge works {{gave the}} mosque its present aspect. The fame of the Mosque of Uqba {{and of the}} other holy sites at Kairouan helped the city to develop and repopulate increasingly. The university, {{consisting}} <b>of</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>who</b> taught in the mosque, was a centre of education both in Islamic thought and in the secular sciences.

With the decline of the city of Kairouan from the mid 11th century, the centre of intellectual thought moved to the University of Ez-Zitouna in Tunis.|$|E
25|$|St. Catharine's College, Cambridge {{was founded}} on St Catharine’s Day (25 November) 1473 by Robert Woodlark (the then-provost of King's College Cambridge) who sought to create a small {{community}} <b>of</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>who</b> would study exclusively theology and philosophy. Wodelarke may have chosen the name in homage to Catherine of Valois, mother of Henry VI of England, although {{it is more likely}} that it was named as part of the Renaissance cult of Saint Catharine, who was a patron saint of learning. At any rate, the college was ready for habitation and formally founded on Saint Catharine’s Day, 1473.|$|E
25|$|In this period, the Nasi in Tiberias, Hillel II, {{created an}} {{official}} calendar, which needed no monthly sightings of the moon. The months were set, and the calendar needed no further authority from Judea. At {{about the same}} time, the Jewish academy at Tiberius began to collate the combined Mishnah, braitot, explanations, and interpretations developed by generations <b>of</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>who</b> studied {{after the death of}} Judah HaNasi. The text was organized according to the order of the Mishna: each paragraph of Mishnah was followed by a compilation of all of the interpretations, stories, and responses associated with that Mishnah.

25|$|Islamisation in {{the region}} {{surrounding}} Malacca gradually intensified between the 15th and 16th centuries through study centres in Upeh, the district on the north bank of the Malacca River. Islam spread from Malacca to Jambi, Kampar, Bengkalis, Siak, Aru and the Karimun Islands in Sumatra, {{throughout much of the}} Malay peninsula, Java and even Philippines. The Malay Annals even reveals that the courts of Malacca and Pasai posed theological questions and problems to one another. Of the so-called Wali Sanga ('nine saints') responsible in spreading Islam on Java, at least two, Sunan Bonang and Sunan Kalijaga, are said to have studied in Malacca. The Portuguese apothecary and chronicler at the time of Malacca's fall, Tome Pires, in his Suma Oriental mentions that the rulers of Kampar and Indragiri on the east coast of Sumatra converted to Islam as a result of Sultan Muzaffar Shah's influence and went on to study the religion in Malacca. The Malay Annals also mentions a number <b>of</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>who</b> served at the Malacca royal court as teachers and counselors to the various Sultans. Maulana Abu Bakar served in the court of Sultan Mansur Shah and introduced the Kitab Darul Manzum, a theological text translated from the work of an Arab scholar in Mecca. A scholar by the name of Maulana Kadi Sardar Johan served as a religious teacher to both Sultan Mahmud Shah and his son. In addition to Kitab Darul Manzum, the Malay Annals also mentions the Kitab al-luma' fi tasawwuf ('Book of Flashes'), a 10th-century treatise on Sufism by Abu Nasr al-Sarraj.|$|E
