5|$|During the {{communist}} era, {{the legacy of}} Kafka's work for Eastern bloc socialism was hotly debated. Opinions ranged from {{the notion that he}} satirised the bureaucratic bungling of a crumbling Austria-Hungarian Empire, to the belief that he embodied the rise of socialism. A further key point was Marx's theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> While the orthodox position was that Kafka's depictions <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> were no longer relevant for a society that had supposedly eliminated alienation, a 1963 conference held in Liblice, Czechoslovakia, on the eightieth anniversary of his birth, reassessed the importance of Kafka's portrayal of bureaucracy. Whether or not Kafka was a political writer is still an issue of debate.|$|E
5|$|Marx had {{a special}} concern with how people relate to their own labour power. He wrote {{extensively}} about {{this in terms of}} the problem <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> but developed a more materialist conception. Capitalism mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market. For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own labour—one's capacity to transform the world—is tantamount to being alienated from one's own nature and it is a spiritual loss. Marx described this loss as commodity fetishism, in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behaviour merely adapt.|$|E

40|$|The <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> science & {{technology}} {{is a kind of}} abnormal phenomenon coming from the research or use of science & technology. It makes science & technology from the tool that serves and brings benefit to human into the power that controls and harms human, so the regulation <b>of</b> the <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> science & {{technology is}} the requirement of the sound development of science & technology, and the socio-economic progress, as well as the improvement of people’s living standards. Law is the primary measure to regulate the <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> science & technology. The legal regulation is the fundamental way because it provides the value orientation, the norms of behavior, the rational allocation of resources and the reward and punishment mechanism for the control <b>of</b> the <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> science & technology.

40|$|A moral {{alienation}} is {{a complex}} integrative phenomenon characterized by individual’s rejection of universal spiritual and moral values of society. The last opportunity to find a purposeful competent solution of the problem <b>of</b> individual’s moral <b>alienation</b> lies {{in the space of}} professional education. The subject of study {{of this article is to}} identify methods for prevention and correction <b>of</b> moral <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> students that can be used by teachers both in the process of extracurricular activities, and in conducting classes in humanitarian disciplines. The purpose of the work is to study methods and techniques that enhance the effectiveness of the prevention and correction <b>of</b> moral <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> students, identify their characteristics and application in the educational activities of teachers. The paper concretizes a definition of methods to prevent and correct the moral <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> students who represent a system of interrelated actions of educator and students aimed at: redefining of negative values, rules and norms of behavior; overcoming the negative mental states, negative attitudes, interests and aptitudes of aducatees. The article distinguishes and characterizes the most effective methods for prevention and correction <b>of</b> moral <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> students: the conviction, the method of "Socrates"; understanding; semiotic analysis; suggestion, method of "explosion. " It also presents the rules and necessary conditions for the application of these methods in the educational process. It is ascertained that the choice of effective preventive and corrective methods and techniques is determined by the content of intrapersonal, psychological sources <b>of</b> moral <b>alienation</b> associated with the following: negative attitude due to previous experience; orientation to these or those negative values; inadequate self-esteem, having a negative impact on the development and functioning of the individual’s psyche and behavior; mental states. The conclusions of the article confirm that a sequential use of given methods in the educational process is highly efficient. </p...|$|R

5|$|The Danubian {{emperors}} {{ruled the}} empire {{for over a}} century, until 379. Indeed, until 363, power was held by descendants {{of one of the}} original Junta members. Constantine I' s father, Constantius Chlorus, was a Caesar (deputy emperor) in Diocletian's Tetrarchy. Constantine's grandson Julian ruled until 363. These emperors restored the army to its former strength and effectiveness, but were solely concerned with the needs and interests of the military. They were also divorced from the wealthy Roman senatorial families that dominated the Senate and owned much of the empire's land. This in turn bred a feeling <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> from the army among the Roman aristocracy which in the later 4th century began to resist the military's exorbitant demands for recruits and supplies.|$|E
5|$|According to Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, {{the themes}} <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> and persecution, {{although}} present in Kafka's work, have been over-emphasised by critics. They argue Kafka's work is more deliberate and subversive—and more joyful—than may first appear. They {{point out that}} reading the Kafka work while focusing on the futility of his characters' struggles reveals Kafka's play of humour; he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out how people tend to invent problems. In his work, Kafka often created malevolent, absurd worlds. Kafka read drafts of his works to his friends, typically concentrating on his humorous prose. The writer Milan Kundera suggests that Kafka's surrealist humour {{may have been an}} inversion of Dostoyevsky's presentation of characters who are punished for a crime. In Kafka's work a character is punished although a crime has not been committed. Kundera believes that Kafka's inspirations for his characteristic situations came both from growing up in a patriarchal family and living in a totalitarian state.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The notion <b>of</b> work <b>alienation</b> and its {{consequences}} has fascinated scholars and practitioners for a long time. But most research focused on passive performance indicators (such as job satisfaction), while the effects on work alienation on active performance (work effort) and outside work are understudied. This paper therefore examines the impact <b>of</b> work <b>alienation</b> on passive performance (organizational commitment), active performance (work effort), and its impact outside work (workfamily enrichment). Hypotheses are formulated based on two research streams: sociology of work and organization in relation to work alienation and work-family literature in relation to enrichment. Two dimensions <b>of</b> work <b>alienation</b> are considered: powerlessness and meaninglessness. Both literature streams expect a negative impact <b>of</b> work <b>alienation</b> on employee outcomes. Hypotheses are tested on survey data collected among a national sample of midwives in the Netherlands (respondents: 790, response rate 61 %). Findings indicate that work alienation does not only {{have an impact on}} passive performance, but also on active performance and outside work. In particular work meaninglessness is relevant for outcomes. This underscores the importance of lowering the degree <b>of</b> work <b>alienation,</b> which has effects inside and outside the work context...|$|R

5|$|Caesium-137, with a {{half-life}} of 30.17years, {{is one of}} the {{two principal}} medium-lived fission products, along with strontium-90, which are responsible for most of the radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel after several years of cooling, up to several hundred years after use. It constitutes most of the radioactivity still left from the Chernobyl accident. Caesium-137 undergoes high-energy beta decay and eventually becomes stable barium-137. It is a strong emitter of gamma radiation. Caesium-137 has a very low rate of neutron capture and cannot be feasibly disposed of in this way, but must be allowed to decay. Caesium-137 {{has been used as a}} tracer in hydrologic studies, analogous to the use of tritium. Small amounts of caesium-134 and caesium-137 were released into the environment during nearly all nuclear weapon tests and some nuclear accidents, most notably the Goiânia accident and the Chernobyl disaster. As of 2005, caesium-137 is the principal source of radiation in the zone <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Its chemical properties as one of the alkali metals make it one of most problematic of the short-to-medium-lifetime fission products because it easily moves and spreads in nature due to the high water solubility of its salts, and is taken up by the body, which mistakes it for its essential congeners sodium and potassium.|$|E
5|$|Extramusical {{connotations of}} this kind have {{sometimes}} {{been used as a}} basis {{for the construction of a}} psychological or biographical narrative, attempting to interpret the musical program behind Schubert's last sonatas. Charles Fisk has suggested that the sonatas portray a protagonist going through successive stages <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> banishment, exile, and eventual homecoming (in the A major and B-flat Sonatas), or self-assertion (in the C minor Sonata). Discrete tonalities or tonal strata, appearing in complete musical segregation from one another at the beginning of each sonata, suggest contrasting psychological states, such as reality and dream, home and exile, etc.; these conflicts are further deepened in the ensuing slow movements. Once these contrasts are resolved at the finale, by intensive musical integration and the gradual transition from one tonality to the next, a sense of reconciliation, of acceptance and homecoming, is invoked. Fisk's hypothetical narrative is grounded on the basis of the ample cyclic connections within the sonatas and their unique tonal design, as well as their musical similarities to songs such as Der Wanderer and the Winterreise song cycle; and on biographical evidence concerning Schubert's life, including a story written by Schubert (Mein Traum – My Dream). Fisk suggests that the sonatas convey Schubert's own feelings of loneliness and alienation; by their striving towards musical and tonal integration, the writing of these works offered Schubert a release from his emotional distress, particularly deepened after finishing the composition of the lonely, depressive and hopeless songs of Winterreise, during the preceding year.|$|E
