5|$|Some {{mainframe}} {{games that}} did not appear in 101 BASIC Computer Games have still had a lasting impact. One such game was Space Travel, developed by Ken Thompson in 1969, which simulates travel in the Solar System. The player flies their ship around a two-dimensional scale model {{of the solar system}} with no objectives other than to attempt to land on various planets and moons. The player can move and turn the ship, and adjust the <b>overall</b> <b>speed</b> by adjusting the scale of the simulation. The ship is affected by the single strongest gravitational pull of the astronomical bodies. The game was developed at Bell Labs, and was ported during 1969 from the Multics operating system to the GECOS operating system on the GE 635 computer, and then to the PDP-7 minicomputer. While porting the game to the PDP-7, Thompson developed ideas for his own operating system, which later formed the core of the Unix operating system. Space Travel never spread beyond Bell Labs or had an effect on future games, leaving its primary legacy as part of the original push for the development of Unix.|$|E

25|$|Early {{steering}} {{systems were}} adopted from tracked work vehicles, generally using a clutch to reduce power to one track, {{causing it to}} slow down.

Delivering power to both tracks while turning them at different speeds is a difficult design problem.|$|E

25|$|All {{steps of}} {{glycolysis}} {{take place in}} the cytosol and so does the reaction catalysed by GAPDH. In red blood cells, GAPDH and several other glycolytic enzymes assemble in complexes {{on the inside of the}} cell membrane. The process appears to be regulated by phosphorylation and oxygenation.

Recent studies have also revealed that GAPDH is expressed in an iron dependent fashion on the exterior of the cell membrane a where it plays a role in maintenance of cellular iron homeostasis.|$|E
25|$|One {{limitation}} (also afflicting the Intel Pentium III) is that SRAM cache designs at {{the time}} were incapable of keeping up with the Athlon's clock scalability, due both to manufacturing limitations of the cache chips and the difficulty of routing electrical connections to the cache chips themselves. It became increasingly difficult to reliably run an external processor cache to match the processor speeds being released—and in fact it became impossible. Thus initially the Level 2 cache ran at half of the CPU clock speed up to 700MHz (350MHz cache). Faster Slot-A processors had to compromise further and run at 2/5 (up to 850MHz, 340MHz cache) or 1/3 (up to 1GHz, 333MHz cache). This later race to 1GHz (1000MHz) by AMD and Intel further exacerbated this bottleneck as ever higher speed processors demonstrated decreasing gains in overall performance—stagnant SRAM cache memory speeds choked further improvements in <b>overall</b> <b>speed.</b> This directly lead to the development of integrating L2 cache onto the processor itself and remove the dependence on external cache chips. AMD's integration of the cache onto the Athlon processor itself would later result in the Athlon Thunderbird.|$|E
