Fall <b>out</b> <b>dust</b> {{sampling}} and monitoring is {{becoming one of}} the preferred methods to determine dust pollution impact from industries/or mines on the receiving environment. Fall <b>out</b> <b>dust</b> monitoring is a useful and cost effective method of providing trend analysis of dust deposition over a period of time. It also provides an indication of the main areas of dust generation and can be conducted for both health and nuisance purposes. The aim {{of the study was to}} develop a positioning guideline for fall <b>out</b> <b>dust</b> monitoring equipment in order to optimise the existing fall <b>out</b> <b>dust</b> programme...|$|R
50|$|Carpet rods, rattan rugbeaters, and carpet-beating {{machines}} for beating <b>out</b> <b>dust,</b> and also brooms, brushes, dustpans, and shaking and hanging were all carpet-cleaning {{methods of the}} 19th century; brooms particularly carry risks of wear.|$|R

50|$|For on line {{cleaning}} of the deposits from the baskets steam jets are provided {{such that the}} blown <b>out</b> <b>dust</b> and ash are collected at the bottom ash hopper of the air preheater. This dust hopper is connected for emptying along with the main dust hoppers of the dust collectors.|$|R
50|$|In October 2014, the POLARBEAR {{experiment}} published separate B-mode polarization measurements and, with 97.2% confidence, {{was able}} to rule <b>out</b> <b>dust</b> and other contaminants as the source. However, the B-modes measured by POLARBEAR did not arise from inflationary gravity waves, but from gravitational lensing of {{the cosmic microwave background}} by intervening structure.|$|R
50|$|The {{periphery}} {{around the}} campus has a green buffer of heavy plantation, which filters <b>out</b> <b>dust</b> and {{noise from the}} vicinity and helps in maintaining pleasant surroundings. Rainwater harvesting system has been adopted. Waste water is recycled for horticultural needs. Solar energy panels supplement power generation; provide hot water in winters and street light at night. An in-house sub-station is operational.|$|R
50|$|An armoire desk is a writing-table built {{within a}} large cabinet, usually 1.5 - 2.0 m high. The cabinet is closed by {{two to four}} full-height doors, to keep <b>out</b> <b>dust</b> or to give a tidy {{appearance}} to a room by hiding the cluttered working surface of the desk. This form of desk is usually placed against a wall, like its antique uncle, the secretary desk.|$|R
50|$|In physics {{experiments}} and demonstrations, lycopodium powder {{is used to}} make sound waves in air visible for observation and measurement, {{and to make a}} pattern of electrostatic charge visible. The powder is also highly hydrophobic; if the surface of a cup of water is coated with lycopodium powder, a finger or other object inserted straight into the cup will come <b>out</b> <b>dusted</b> with the powder but remain perfectly dry.|$|R

2500|$|Midland Works emitted vast {{quantities}} of asbestos dust, primarily through its ventilation system, which covered the nearby streets and rooftops of surrounding houses. One resident told of how his wife [...] "used to wipe the greyish white dust off the window sills of their home at 9.30 am, and that an hour later, if the machines at Roberts were blowing <b>out</b> <b>dust,</b> there would be another layer of dust half an inch thick." ...|$|R
5000|$|The playfully {{imagined}} [...] "radio", {{exhibited at}} MOMA by artist James Chambers, {{but according to}} Chambers' backstory first seen in 1972, was engineered to sneeze, blowing <b>out</b> <b>dust</b> and shaking its case. In the backstory, the radio did this routinely once every six months. The Radio was supposedly created by an experimental research group at Texas Instruments. The exclamation [...] "Gesundheit!" [...] ("Health!", i.e. [...] "Bless you!") is the German response {{to someone who has}} sneezed.|$|R
2500|$|Kase {{provided}} similar in-depth coverage {{leading up}} to the July 1923 championship bout between lightweights Benny Leonard, born in the Jewish ghetto of New York's Lower East Side, and Lew Tendler. [...] When Leonard successfully defended his title in front of a crowd of 60,000 spectators at Yankee Stadium, Kase wrote that the title of [...] "The Old Master," [...] previously used to describe Joe Gans, [...] "may now in all probability be hauled <b>out,</b> <b>dusted</b> off and placed firmly on the brow of Benny Leonard." ...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that {{vegetation}} can filter <b>out</b> <b>dust,</b> shoot, smoke and much other fine particulate matter present in air by process of absorption, detoxification, accumulation or metabolization. The tree species possessing higher dust escaping capacity has higher chances of survival in the polluted areas. The study indicated that evergreen plants with simple, rough, hairy and fast growing trees are good dust arrestors. The study suggested a systematic way of selecting plant species {{on the basis of}} their efficiency in dust control. Â© Enviromedia...|$|R

2500|$|.....Can the old {{concerns}} about capital be taken <b>out,</b> <b>dusted</b> down and addressed to contemporary models? If {{that could be}} done, one would hope that its contribution could be more constructive than the mutually assured destruction approach that marred some of the 1960s debates. It is evident that richer models yield richer possibilities. They do not do that in proportion when optimization drives model solutions. However, we know that many-agent models can have multiple equilibria when all agents optimize. There may be fruitful paths forward in that direction.|$|R

50|$|Research, {{published}} in January 2010 using HiRISE images, {{found that some}} of the channels in spiders grow larger as they go uphill since gas is doing the erosion. The researchers also found that the gas flows to a crack that has occurred at a weak point in the ice. As soon as the sun rises above the horizon, gas from the spiders blows <b>out</b> <b>dust</b> which is blown by wind to form a dark fan shape. Some of the dust gets trapped in the channels. Eventually frost covers all the fans and channels until the next spring when the cycle repeats.|$|R
50|$|The saiga stands 61 - 81 cm at the shoulder, {{and weighs}} 26 - 69 kg. The head-and-body length is {{typically}} between 100 and 140 cm. A prominent {{feature of the}} saiga is the pair of closely spaced, bloated nostrils directed downward. Other facial features include the dark markings on the cheeks and the nose, and the 7 - 12 cm long ears. During summer migrations the saigas' nose helps filter <b>out</b> <b>dust</b> kicked up by the herd and cools the animal's blood. In the winter it heats up the frigid air before it is taken to the lungs.|$|R

2500|$|The M3/M3A1's 30-round {{magazine}} {{was the source}} of complaints throughout the service life of the weapon. [...] Unlike the Thompson, the M3 fed from a double-column, single-feed detachable box magazine which held 30 rounds and was patterned after the British Sten magazine; the single-feed design proved difficult to load by hand, and was more easily jammed by mud, dust, and dirt than double-column, double-feed designs like the Thompson. [...] Additionally, the feed lips of the single-feed design proved more susceptible to feed malfunctions when slightly bent or damaged. Plastic dust caps were later issued to cover the feed end of the magazine and keep <b>out</b> <b>dust</b> as well as protect the sensitive feed lips.|$|R
40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{modelling}} of a {{dust collection}} system in an underground mine crushing plant was carried <b>out.</b> <b>Dust</b> was collected/absorbed through the holes along {{the top edge of}} Run of Mine (ROM) bin. The dust collection performance of the system is summarised. The detail results are presented in the form of velocity vectors and dust concentration iso-surface contours. Time dependent dust concentration isosurfaces are also presented. Dust was found to be well contained within the crusher bin and stands out as a viable option. However, the velocity magnitudes were found to be very high in and around the whole exits, which has the potential to lead to undesirable pressure drop and generation of noise...|$|R
