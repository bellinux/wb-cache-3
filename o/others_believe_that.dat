Sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while <b>others</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> autism is simply another way of being.|$|E
5|$|The {{value of}} Marquis' work was {{properly}} recognized only after his death. Liberty and <b>others</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{it took so}} long to publish much of his work because of his controversial theory on the suicide of Custer's men. Historian Brian Dippie suggests that the Great Depression may also have been a contributing factor.|$|E
5|$|On July 16, 1970, a large {{disturbance}} {{separated from}} the Intertropical Convergence Zone near Panama. The broad area of convection dominated the region between Swan Island and western Cuba by July 18. Some sources state that the area of convection was joined by a low-level vortex that entered the area, eventually forming a depression. <b>Others</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the origins of Becky can be tracked back to a tropical wave that moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on July 9.|$|E
50|$|During the 1940s Dale was {{embroiled in}} the {{scientific}} debate over the nature of signaling at the synapse. Dale and <b>others</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> signaling at the synapse was chemical, while John Carew Eccles and <b>others</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the synapse was electrical. It was later found that most synaptic signalling is chemical, {{but there are some}} synapses that are electrical.|$|R

5|$|Although {{couples are}} {{starting}} to use condoms during extramarital intercourse more frequently, condom use during marital sex is still viewed as inappropriate by many Malawians; in 2000, only 2.3% of people reported using condoms regularly during sexual intercourse with their spouses. Some people believe that condoms are only necessary during sex with high-risk partners such as sex workers, and that condom use during marital sex implies infidelity. <b>Others</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> marital condom use violates the religious purposes of marriage: sexual pleasure and reproduction. In {{a study published in}} 2007 by Agnes M. Chimbiri, men claimed that they use condoms with their wives for the sake of avoiding unwanted pregnancies; on the other hand, they were more concerned about sexually transmitted infections when discussing condom use with extramarital sexual partners.|$|E
5|$|Arafat's long {{personal}} and political survival was taken by most Western commentators {{as a sign of}} his mastery of asymmetric warfare and his skill as a tactician, given the extremely dangerous nature of politics of the Middle East and the frequency of assassinations. Some commentators believe his survival was largely due to Israel's fear that he could become a martyr for the Palestinian cause if he were assassinated or even arrested by Israel. <b>Others</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Israel refrained from taking action against Arafat because it feared Arafat less than Hamas and the other Islamist movements gaining support over Fatah. The complex and fragile web of relations between the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab states contributed also to Arafat's longevity {{as the leader of the}} Palestinians.|$|E
5|$|Keith {{finds out}} that Selma might have {{disappeared}} {{to get away from}} her husband. Veronica shows Wallace the Roman numerals, and they deduce that it is a date, and Veronica learns that a sorority house member died on that day. Veronica confronts a sorority girl about the dead member, and she implies that <b>others</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> something happened to her. After finding out that leaving her husband after ten years would be beneficial to Selma, Veronica and Keith break into the Roses’ house and find Selma on the couch. Selma tells the pair why she has “disappeared”: Mr. Rose is trying to scam her for more money and has blackmailed her with knowledge of a lesbian affair with her dog walker.|$|E

5|$|Evidence for a virus {{as a cause}} {{include the}} {{presence}} of oligoclonal bands {{in the brain and}} cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections. Human herpes viruses are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the Epstein–Barr virus are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. Although some consider that this goes against the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, <b>others</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the trigger for the disease. Other diseases that may be related include measles, mumps and rubella.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{execution}} of Joachim III, who had previously saved Theodore Svetoslav from Byzantine captivity, are not entirely clear. Historians Ivan Bozhilov and Vasil Gyuzelev speculate that the Patriarch was among the responsible dignitaries for a Mongol invasion in 1285, after which Theodore Svetoslav had to be sent a hostage in the Golden Horde. John Van Antwerp Fine Jr. suggests that the alleged treachery might {{be linked to the}} obscure period when Smilets overthrew George Terter I. <b>Others</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the verdict was a result of the desire of the new emperor to seek personal retribution from those who he deemed responsible for the hardships of his youth. However, most agree that the actions of Theodore Svetoslav consolidated the shaken imperial authority and paved the way for his long and successful reign. Bulgaria prospered between 1300 and 1321; the Mongol interference was dealt with and the country even regained Bessarabia from the Golden Horde.|$|E
5|$|The {{spread of}} Christianity {{in the north}} of Britain gained ground when Edwin of Northumbria married Æthelburg, a {{daughter}} of Æthelbert, and agreed to allow her to continue to worship as a Christian. He also agreed to allow Paulinus of York to accompany her as a bishop, and for Paulinus to preach to the court. By 627, Paulinus had converted Edwin, and on Easter, 627, Edwin was baptised. Many others were baptised after the king's conversion. The exact date when Paulinus went north is unclear; some historians argue for 625, the traditional date, whereas <b>others</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it was closer to 619. Higham argues that the marriage alliance was part of an attempt by Eadbald, brother of the bride, to capitalise on the death of Rædwald in about 624, in an attempt to regain the overkingship his father had once enjoyed. According to Higham, Rædwald's death also removed one of the political factors keeping Eadbald from converting, and Higham dates Eadbald's baptism to the time that his sister was sent to Northumbria. Although Bede's account gives all the initiative to Edwin, it is likely that Eadbald also was active in seeking such an alliance. Edwin's position in the north also was helped by Rædwald's death, and Edwin seems to have held some authority over other kingdoms until his death.|$|E

25|$|Male {{hind legs}} are {{specialized}} to store aromatic compounds. There can {{be up to}} seventy compounds in each tibia. Some researchers believe that these compounds are used to form male leks, while <b>others</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the compounds may be changed into sex hormones. Still <b>others</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> these aromatic compounds may be a courtship gift or an anti-predator ward. In 2005, Thomas Eltz and his research group discovered that male Eufriesea will release different aromatic compounds using complex leg maneuvers, giving credence to the hypothesis that these compounds {{play a role in}} mating, though they may have multiple uses.|$|E
25|$|As to the {{relative}} merits of the two techniques, some believe that Shelley ringing is rendered obsolete when four-in-hand is perfected, while <b>others</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the motion of the clappers in the same plane makes certain techniques more feasable, particulary shaking, martellato and vibrato.|$|E

25|$|Some {{historians have}} {{interpreted}} these changes negatively.

25|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{withdrawal}} of the Sikhs from Ferozeshah are contentious.

25|$|In addition, many {{effective}} altruists {{think that}} future generations have equal moral value to currently existing people, so {{they focus on}} reducing existential risks to humanity. <b>Others</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the interests of non-human animals should be accorded the same moral weight as similar interests of humans and work to prevent the suffering of animals, such as those raised in factory farms.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} {{and nature of}} sacrifices in Judaism {{are based on the}} 613 commandments, theology and halakha.
