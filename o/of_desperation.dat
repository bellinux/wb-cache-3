Brian manages to get 10,000 more signatures on a new petition {{to show it to}} Mayor West, but West still won't change his mind. Out <b>of</b> <b>desperation,</b> Brian takes a security guard’s gun, and holds the mayor hostage.|$|E
5|$|David Ignatius, a {{columnist}} for the Washington Post {{and the author of the}} book Body of Lies, opined that the CIA had become careless out <b>of</b> <b>desperation.</b> According to Ignatius, it would be obvious that the CIA would have been so eager to acquire knowledge about the location of Osama bin Laden that it would take every available opportunity to get information. Shoshana Bryen, a U.S. security expert, said that the bombing would make Israel and the U.S. wary in their future dealings with Jordan.|$|E
5|$|Gian Gastone {{arrived in}} Tuscany, without his wife, in 1708. The Emperor, {{thinking}} {{it unlikely that}} any male heirs were to be born to the Medici, prepared to occupy Tuscany, under the pretext of Medici descent. He intimated that upon the Grand Prince's death the Tuscans would rebel against Cosimo's autocratic government. Cosimo, in an act <b>of</b> <b>desperation,</b> had Francesco Maria, the Medici family cardinal, renounce his religious vows and marry Eleanor of Gonzaga, the youngest child of the incumbent Duke of Guastalla. Two years later, Francesco Maria died, taking with him any hope of an heir.|$|E

Connors refuses to rush the drug-testing {{procedure}} and put innocent people at risk.

In an act <b>of</b> <b>desperation,</b> Connors tries the formula on himself. After passing out, he awakens to find his missing arm has regenerated. Discovering that Ratha {{is on his way to}} the VA hospital, Connors, whose skin is turning green and scaly, goes to intercept him.

5|$|Despite being a {{tactical}} draw, Antietam {{is considered a}} turning point {{of the war and}} a victory for the Union because it ended Lee's strategic campaign (his first invasion of the North) and it allowed President Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, taking effect on January 1, 1863. Although Lincoln had intended to issue the proclamation earlier, he was advised by his Cabinet to wait until a Union victory to avoid the perception that it was issued out <b>of</b> <b>desperation.</b> The Union victory and Lincoln's proclamation played a considerable role in dissuading the governments of France and Britain from recognizing the Confederacy; some suspected they were planning {{to do so in the}} aftermath of another Union defeat. McClellan had no prior knowledge that the plans for emancipation rested on his battle performance.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{dissatisfaction with}} McClellan's failure to {{reinforce}} Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, {{to the dismay}} of all in his cabinet but Seward. Two days after McClellan's return to command, General Robert E. Lee's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862. The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January. Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product <b>of</b> <b>desperation.</b>|$|E

50|$|Also {{noteworthy}} is the artist's use {{of discarded}} or abject materials, including {{but not limited}} to elephant dung, chicken parts, strands of African-American hair, and bottles of cheap wine. Many critics see these objects as evocative <b>of</b> the <b>desperation</b> <b>of</b> the poor, Black urban class, but Hammons reportedly saw a sort of sacrosanct or ritualistic power in these materials, which is why he utilized them so extensively.|$|R
5|$|Dustin Kensrue and Teppei Teranishi {{knew each}} other from school and had played in a band called Chapter 11.

Hard-pressed for time, they decided {{to go with the}} name 'Thrice' out <b>of</b> <b>desperation.</b> Thrice was initially an inside joke between the band members, {{and they were going to}} use it only temporarily for their first show. However, they began to gain fans with the name, and people started to associate them with it, so they were forced to keep it.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out <b>of</b> <b>desperation.</b> Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E

5|$|The {{involvement}} {{of those in}} Hamilton's circle such as Schuyler, William Duer, James Duane, Gouverneur Morris, and Rufus King as speculators was not favorable to those against the report, either, though Hamilton personally did not own or deal {{a share in the}} debt. Madison eventually spoke against it by February 1790. Although he was not against current holders of government debt to profit, he wanted the windfall to go to the original holders. Madison did not feel that the original holders had lost faith in the government, but sold their securities out <b>of</b> <b>desperation.</b> The compromise was seen as egregious to both Hamiltonians and their dissidents such as Maclay, and Madison's vote was defeated 36 votes to 13 on February 22.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} in a {{different}} place for each playable character. With the exception of Carlie, the main character is soon told (or otherwise decides) to seek the advice of the Priest of Light in the Holy City Wendel. They arrive at the city of Jadd soon after the Beastmen have invaded. Due to the Beastmen's werewolf powers, they are able to make an escape by night. The main character—now including Carlie—on the way to Wendel stays overnight in Astoria where they are woken by a bright light. Following it, it reveals itself to be a Faerie from the Mana Sanctuary, exhausted by her journey. Out <b>of</b> <b>desperation,</b> the Faerie chooses the main character to be her host, and tells them to get to Wendel. There, while they explain their grievances to the Priest of Light, the Faerie interrupts and explains that the Mana Tree is dying and that the Sanctuary is in danger. The Priest explains that if the Tree dies, the God Beasts will reawaken and destroy the world. He goes on to explain further that, because the Faerie has chosen the main character as its host, they must travel to the Sanctuary to draw the Sword of Mana from the foot of the Mana Tree. They can then restore peace to the world, and have their wishes granted by the Mana Goddess if the sword is drawn before the Tree dies. A great deal of power is needed to open the gate to the Sanctuary. The Faerie does not have the strength to do it, and the ancient spell which would do so by unlocking the power in the Mana Stones also takes the caster's life. The Stones' guarding elemental spirits, however, will to be able to open the gate if their powers are combined.|$|E
