25|$|The new, more {{comprehensive}} exhibits included 35 watercolor paintings and 25 of the work's original 140 handwritten manuscript pages, with his almost illegible handwriting penciled onto 'Fidelity' watermarked <b>onion</b> <b>skin</b> paper. The autograph manuscript pages included struck-through content {{that was not}} published in the novella's first edition. As well, some 43 preparatory pencil drawings that evolved into the story's illustrations accompanied the manuscript, many of them dampened by moisture that rippled its <b>onion</b> <b>skin</b> media. One painting depicted the prince floating above Earth wearing a yellow scarf was wrinkled, having been crumpled up and thrown away before being retrieved for preservation. Another drawing loaned from Silvia Hamilton's grandson depicted the diminutive prince observing a sunset on his home asteroid; two other {{versions of the same}} drawing were also displayed alongside it allowing visitors to observe the drawing's progressive refinement. The initial working manuscript and sketches, displayed side-by-side with pages from the novella's first edition, allowed viewers to observe the evolution of Saint-Exupéry's work.|$|E
25|$|All of the novella's {{simple but}} elegant {{watercolour}} illustrations, which were {{integral to the}} story, were painted by Saint-Exupéry. He had studied architecture as a young adult but nevertheless could not be considered an artist — which he self-mockingly alluded to in the novella's introduction. Several of his illustrations were painted {{on the wrong side}} of the delicate <b>onion</b> <b>skin</b> paper that he used, his medium of choice. As with some of his draft manuscripts, he occasionally gave away preliminary sketches to close friends and colleagues; others were even recovered as crumpled balls from the floors in the cockpits he flew. Two or three original Little Prince drawings were reported in the collections of New York artist, sculptor and experimental filmmaker Joseph Cornell. One rare original Little Prince watercolour would be mysteriously sold at a second-hand book fair in Japan in 1994, and subsequently authenticated in 2007.|$|E
500|$|The {{manuscript}} {{length of}} A Feast for Crows eventually surpassed A Storm of Swords. Martin {{was reluctant to}} make the necessary deep cuts to get the book down to publishable length, as that would have compromised the story he had in mind. Printing the book in [...] "microtype on <b>onion</b> <b>skin</b> paper and giving each reader a magnifying glass" [...] was also not an option for him. On the other hand, Martin rejected the publishers' idea of splitting the narrative chronologically into A Feast for Crows, Parts One and Two. Being already late with the book, Martin had not even started writing all characters' stories and also objected to ending the first book without any resolution for its many viewpoint characters as in previous books.|$|E

Lesions which destroy lower areas of the spinal trigeminal nucleus (but spare higher areas) preserve pain-temperature sensation in the nose (V1), upper lip (V2) and mouth (V3) and remove pain-temperature sensation from the forehead (V1), cheeks (V2) and chin (V3). Although analgesia in this distribution is [...] "nonphysiologic" [...] {{in the traditional sense}} (because it crosses several dermatomes), this analgesia is found in humans after surgical sectioning of the spinal tract of the trigeminal nucleus.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} 140-page autograph {{manuscript of}} The Little Prince, along with various drafts and trial drawings, were acquired from the author's close friend Silvia Hamilton in 1968 by curator Herbert Cahoon of the Pierpont Morgan Library (now The Morgan Library & Museum) in Manhattan, New York City. It {{is the only}} known surviving handwritten draft of the complete work. The manuscript's pages include large amounts of the author's prose that was struck-through and therefore not published {{as part of the}} first edition. In addition to the manuscript, several watercolour illustrations by the author are also held by the museum. They were not part of the first edition. The institution has marked both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of the novella's publication, along with the centenary celebration of the author's birth, with major exhibitions of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's literary works. [...] Physically, the manuscript's <b>onion</b> <b>skin</b> media has become brittle and subject to damage. Saint-Exupéry's handwriting is described as being doctor-like, verging on indecipherable.|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} (July 23rd) was a forced halt, a sore {{stimulant}} to the traveller's ill-humour; and the sun, the sand, the dust, the furious Samum, and the want of certain small supplies, aggravated our grievance. My sore foot had been inflamed by a dressing of <b>onion</b> <b>skin</b> which the lady Maryam had insisted upon applying to it.[FN#7] Still being resolved to push forward by any conveyance {{that could be}} procured, I offered ten dollars for a fresh dromedary to take me on to Al- Madinah. Shaykh Hamid also declared he would leave his box {{in charge of a}} friend and accompany me. Sa'ad the Demon flew into a passion at the idea of any member of the party escaping the general evil; and he privily threatened Mohammed to cut off the legs of any camel that ventured into camp. This, the boy-who, like a boy of the world as he was, never lost an opportunity of making mischief-instantly communicated to me, and it brought on a furious dispute. Sa'ad was reproved and apologised for {{by the rest of the}} party; and presently he himself was pacified, principally, I believe, by the intelligence that no camel was to be hired at Bir Abbas. One of the Arnaut garrison, who had obtained leave to go to Al-Madinah, came to ask us if we could mount him, as otherwise he should be obliged to walk the whole way. With him we debated the propriety of attempting a passage through the hills by one of the many by-paths that traverse them: the project was amply discussed, and duly rejected.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the anti-proliferative activity of flavonoids from <b>onion</b> <b>skins,</b> extraction by 50 % ethanol (v/v), soxhlet polar fractionation, pH gradient separation, thin-layer chromatography, and recrystallization methods {{were used to}} isolate and purify flavonoids from dry <b>onion</b> <b>skins.</b> Anti-proliferative activities of some flavonoids obtained on leukemia K 562 cell line were deter-mined by MTT assay. Results showed that flavonoids of <b>onion</b> <b>skins</b> were mainly in form of quercetin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, apigenin- 7 -O-β-D-glucopyranoside, quercetin- 3 -O-β-D-glucopyranoside, kaempferol- 7 -O-β-D-glucopyranoside and rutin. Quercetin and kaempferol decreased K 562 cell viability, and quercetin had stronger effect. However, isorhamnetin and rutin exhibited certain proliferation-promoting effects. It suggests that ortho hydroxyl groups on B ring of onion flavonoids might be the key structural elements of their cytotoxic effects on K 562 cells, and hydroxyl groups in position 3 or carbonyl groups in position 4 {{might be one of}} the structural effect elements...|$|R

50|$|Exfoliation (or <b>onion</b> <b>skin</b> weathering) is {{the gradual}} {{removing}} of spall {{due to the}} cyclic increase and decrease in {{the temperature of the}} surface layers of the rock. Rocks do not conduct heat well, so when they are exposed to extreme heat the outermost layer becomes much hotter than the rock underneath causing differential thermal expansion. This differential expansion causes sub-surface shear stress, in turn causing spalling. Extreme temperature change, such as forest fires, can also cause spalling of rock. This mechanism of weathering causes the outer surface of the rock to fall off in thin fragments, sheets or flakes, hence the name exfoliation or <b>onion</b> <b>skin</b> weathering.|$|E

5|$|In rivercane basketweaving among Southeastern Woodlands {{tribes in}} the Americas, {{butternut}} (Juglans cinerea) and yellow root (Xanthorhiza simplicissima) provide a rich yellow color.

Navajo artists create yellow dyes from small snake-weed, brown <b>onion</b> <b>skins,</b> and rubber plant (Parthenium incanum). Rabbitbush (Chrysothamnus) and rose hips produce pale, yellow-cream colored dyes.|$|R
