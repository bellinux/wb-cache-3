They also record footage <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>involved</b> in anti-social behaviour on the streets. The aim is to give other police officers up to date information on the appearance {{of people who have}} broken the law. Video footage thus collected is constantly replayed on TV screens in rooms where officers complete their paperwork. Footage that they have recorded has also been uploaded onto YouTube in an attempt to catch people they believe have reoffended.|$|E
5|$|Thanjavur is an {{important}} centre of silk weaving in Tamil Nadu. There were 200 silk weaving units in the city in 1991 with around 80,000 people working in them. The sarees produced in the villages surrounding Thanjavur are sold in Thanjavur and neighbouring towns. Increasing production costs and competition from large-scale producers have reduced the number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>involved</b> in the production. The city produces bell metal craft like Thanjavur metal plates, bronze images bowls, napkins and powder boxes made of copper and bronze. The city is a major manufacturer of pith works consisting of models of Hindu idols, mosques, garlands and other bird figurines. Manufacture of musical instruments like veena, tambura, violin, mrithamgam, thavil and kanjira is another economic activity in the city.|$|E

5|$|After the {{completion}} of Kanon, the Key staff started production on Air and expanded the number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>involved</b> in this project compared to Kanon. The executive producer for Air was Takahiro Baba from VisualArt's, the publishing company that Key is under. The planning for Air was headed by Jun Maeda who {{was also one of}} two main scenario writers, the other being Takashi Ishikawa. Scenario assistance was provided by four more people: Kazuki Fujii, Kai, Tōya Okano, and Yūichi Suzumoto. Art direction was headed by Key's artist Itaru Hinoue who worked on the character design. Further computer graphics were split between three people—Miracle Mikipon, Na-Ga, and Shinory—and background art was provided by Din and Torino. The music in the game was composed primarily by Shinji Orito, Jun Maeda, and Magome Togoshi, who had started working with Key since before Kanons release. After {{the completion}} of Air, two of the staff—Kazuki Fujii, and Takashi Ishikawa—left Key.|$|E

25|$|Non-government {{bodies and}} persons have also {{undertaken}} their own investigations. For example, in 2005, a South Korean freelance journalist, Jung Soo-woong, located in Japan some descendants <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>involved</b> in the 1895 assassination of Empress Myeongseong (Queen Min). The assassination {{was conducted by}} the Genyōsha, perhaps {{under the auspices of}} the Japanese government, because of the Empress's involvement in attempts to reduce Japanese influence in Korea. Jung recorded the apologies of the persons.|$|E
25|$|However, consequentialism {{and virtue}} ethics {{need not be}} entirely antagonistic. Philosopher Iain King has {{developed}} an approach which reconciles the two schools. Other consequentialists consider effects on the character <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>involved</b> in an action when assessing consequence. Similarly, a consequentialist theory may aim at the maximization of a particular virtue or set of virtues. Finally, following Foot's lead, one might adopt a sort of consequentialism that argues that virtuous activity ultimately produces the best consequences.|$|E

25|$|The {{military}} {{actions of the}} novel are very closely based upon the Mauritius campaign of 1809–1811 {{carried out by the}} Royal Navy in 1810 under Commodore Josias Rowley with the assistance of army forces under Harry Keating. O'Brian notes this in the preface. Réunion (Île Bourbon or Île Bonaparte) was taken completely in July 1810, and Mauritius (Île de France, earlier called Mauritius by the Dutch) was formally captured on 3 December 1810. Many of the names <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>involved</b> in that action are given to characters in the novel.|$|E

25|$|A midrash asked, How {{many times}} was Joseph sold? In {{analyzing}} , {{there are five}} different Hebrew names used to describe five different groups <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>involved</b> in the transaction of selling Joseph, according to Rabbi Judah and Rav Huna. The first group identified, are Joseph's brothers when Judah brings {{up the idea of}} selling Joseph in verses 26 and 27. The first mention of Ishmaelites (Yishma'elîm) is in verse 25. Then the Hebrew phrase ŉāshîm midyanîm sōĥrîm in verse 28 describes Midianite traders. A fourth group in verse 36 is named in Hebrew as m‘danîm that is properly identified as Medanites. The final group, where a transaction is made, is among the Egyptians in the same verse.|$|E
25|$|For works written {{independently}} of the publisher, writers often first submit a query letter or proposal directly to a literary agent or to a publisher. Submissions sent directly to a publisher {{are referred to as}} unsolicited submissions, and the majority come from previously unpublished authors. If the publisher accepts unsolicited manuscripts, then the manuscript is placed in the slush pile, which publisher's readers sift through to identify manuscripts of sufficient quality or revenue potential to be referred to acquisitions editors for review. The acquisitions editors send their choices to the editorial staff. The time and number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>involved</b> in the process are dependent {{on the size of the}} publishing company, with larger companies having more degrees of assessment between unsolicited submission and publication. Unsolicited submissions have a very low rate of acceptance, with some sources estimating that publishers ultimately choose about three out of every ten thousand unsolicited manuscripts they receive.|$|E

To {{demonstrate}} the motivations <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>involved</b> with these types of films, Petty shows gory clips that Nick Schager of The Village Voice described as [...] "repulsive" [...] and [...] "absorbing".

500|$|In 1868 the Runcorn Railway Bridge {{was opened}} across the Mersey, giving Runcorn direct rail links with Liverpool {{and the rest}} of the country. [...] In the 1880s a {{pipeline}} was opened between Northwich and Weston Point, supplying brine to the salt and chemical works. [...] In 1894 the Manchester Ship Canal was opened throughout its length. [...] This allowed ocean-going ships to travel inland as far as Salford, some of them calling at the port of Runcorn. The rise in population between 1881 and 1891 and the drop by 1901 is explained by the number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>involved</b> in constructing the ship canal. In 1905 the Widnes-Runcorn Transporter Bridge opened, giving a direct link for vehicular traffic for the first time between the two towns.|$|E
500|$|Many {{details about}} the making of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari are in dispute and will {{probably}} remain unsettled due to the large number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>involved</b> {{in the making of}} the film, many of whom have recalled it differently or dramatized their own contributions to its production. Production of the film was delayed about four or five months after the script was purchased. Pommer originally chose Lang as the director of Caligari, and Lang {{even went so far as}} to hold preparatory discussions about the script with Janowitz, but he became unavailable due to his involvement with the filming of The Spiders, so Wiene was selected instead. According to Janowitz, Wiene's father, a successful theatre actor, had [...] "gone slightly mad when he could no longer appear on the stage", and Janowitz believed that experience helped Wiene bring an [...] "intimate understanding" [...] to the source material of Caligari.|$|E
