5|$|Sunglasses: The first {{sunglasses}} {{were invented}} in 12th century China when medieval Chinese magistrates wore smoke-colored lenses to conceal {{their eyes and}} feelings during trials while questioning the witnesses and accused. They were a crude slab of smoked quartz that was made to block <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> from the sun.|$|E

25|$|The {{notion of}} path {{difference}} and constructive or destructive interference used above for the double-slit experiment applies {{as well to}} the display of a single slit of light intercepted on a screen. The main result of this interference is to spread <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> from the narrow slit into a broader image on the screen. This distribution of wave energy is called diffraction.|$|E
25|$|On January 30, 1925, {{after several}} hours of work, Floyd Collins managed to squeeze through several narrow passageways; he claimed he had {{discovered}} a large, grotto chamber, though this was never verified. Because his lamp was dying, {{he had to leave}} quickly before losing all light to the chamber, but became trapped in a small passage on his way out. Collins accidentally knocked over his lamp, putting <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> and was caught by a rock from the cave ceiling, pinning his left leg. The falling rock weighed only 16pounds, but because of its position, obstructed rescuers in completing the removal.|$|E
25|$|Embedded in the {{thylakoid}} membranes {{are important}} protein complexes which carry <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> reactions of photosynthesis. Photosystem II and photosystem I contain light-harvesting complexes with chlorophyll and carotenoids that absorb light energy {{and use it}} to energize electrons. Molecules in the thylakoid membrane use the energized electrons to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space, decreasing the pH and turning it acidic. ATP synthase is a large protein complex that harnesses the concentration gradient of the hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space to generate ATP energy as the hydrogen ions flow back out into the stroma—much like a dam turbine.|$|E

500|$|The Irish {{songwriter}} John Lyons (b. 1934) {{wrote the}} popular song The Kilkenny Louse House.

For the fleas and the bugs they collected to march, And over me stomach they formed a great arch". It has been recorded by Christie Purcell (1952), Mary Delaney on From Puck to Appleby (2003), and the Dubliners on Double Dubliners (1972) among others.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from that}} of the children, little sympathy is {{directed}} toward the bird; David Solkin suggests the subjects of the painting show the dispassionate detachment of the evolving scientific society. Individuals are concerned for each other: the father for his children, the young man for the girl, but the distress of the cockatoo elicits only careful study. [...] To one side of the boy at the rear, the cockatoo's empty cage can be seen on the wall, and to further heighten the drama it is unclear whether the boy is lowering the cage on the pulley to allow the bird to be replaced after the experiment or hoisting the cage back up, certain of its former occupant's death. It has also been suggested that he may be drawing the curtains to block <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> from the full moon.|$|E

Big changes include a new east-facing wall, modern technical facilities and new colour scheme, {{but most importantly}} the floor foundations have been entirely rebuilt and a new sprung wooden dance floor laid down. [...] Unseen for years, having been blacked out, every pane of the Dome's arching, patterned, leaded glass canopy has been cleaned and restored to its original condition {{when it opened in}} 1932.

2500|$|Voris stated, [...] "In {{this current}} {{climate in which}} the Church finds herself...the {{environment}} that exists both outside and inside some quarters, many quarters within the Church—there is an environment, an odor of indifference and lukewarmness that is snuffing <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of faith in so many Catholics; they have succumbed to the cultural religious malaise that sucks {{the life out of}} their souls." [...] He went on, saying that Catholics must know the faith in order to [...] "join the battle" [...] engaging in [...] "spiritual combat, immortal warfare". Citing Pope Leo XIII's comment that [...] " [...] are born for combat", Voris said Catholics are an army and [...] "When an army loses its fighting spirit, when it takes its eye off the objective it will lose the war... a call to arms for Catholics to wake up and fight—for the true, the good, and the beautiful." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, Fricke {{moved to}} Nashville, Tennessee, where she became an in-demand {{background}} vocalist. She sang background for numerous other artists at the time; including Dolly Parton, Barbara Mandrell, Crystal Gayle, Ronnie Milsap, Lynn Anderson, Tanya Tucker, Conway Twitty, and Eddie Rabbitt. However, Fricke's work as background vocalist on several recordings by Johnny Duncan first {{brought her to}} national attention. After supplying uncredited background vocals for such Duncan hits as [...] "Jo and the Cowboy," [...] "Thinkin' of a Rendezvous," [...] "It Couldn't Have Been Any Better," [...] and [...] "Stranger," [...] Fricke was finally rewarded when she was given equal billing with Duncan on his cover of Jay and the Americans' [...] "Come a Little Bit Closer," [...] in which she sang the song's chorus. However, Fricke's contribution to Duncan's number-one hit [...] "Stranger" [...] in 1977 likely generated the most interest. In that song's chorus, Fricke sang the line, [...] "Shut <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> and lead me....".|$|E

2500|$|Now {{overseeing}} three squadrons, O'Hare still {{insisted that}} everyone call him [...] "Butch." [...] O'Hare's VF-6 squadron would [...] "still stay broken up" [...] among three light aircraft carriers, the squadron had made itself just too useful filling <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> carrier air groups, and AirPac had no well-trained replacements on hand. As a result, Fighting Squadron Two (VF-2) boarded the USS Enterprise from November 1943 and became Butch's new Fighting Squadron. While he readied his new air group, he suffered what he intended {{as only a}} temporary separation from his beloved VF-6 [...] "Felix the Cat" [...] Squadron. The news, that the CO had to leave them, hit also the men of VF-6 hard. O'Hare first flew a TBM-1 Avenger as CAG-6 command aircraft with bombardier Del Delchamps, AOM1/c and radioman Hal Coleman as crew members. With its good radio facilities, docile handling, and long range, the Grumman Avenger made an ideal command aircraft for Air Group Commanders (CAGs), but Butch considered the Grumman torpedo bomber as a 'lame turkey' compared to the Grumman F6F Hellcat fighter.|$|E
2500|$|As a result, chloroplasts in [...] {{mesophyll}} {{cells and}} bundle sheath cells are specialized for {{each stage of}} photosynthesis. In mesophyll cells, chloroplasts are specialized for the light reactions, so they lack RuBisCO, and have normal grana and thylakoids, which they use to make ATP and NADPH, as well as oxygen. They store [...] in a four-carbon compound, {{which is why the}} process is called [...] photosynthesis. The four-carbon compound is then transported to the bundle sheath chloroplasts, where it drops off [...] and returns to the mesophyll. Bundle sheath chloroplasts do not carry <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> reactions, preventing oxygen from building up in them and disrupting RuBisCO activity. Because of this, they lack thylakoids organized into grana stacks—though bundle sheath chloroplasts still have free-floating thylakoids in the stroma where they still carry out cyclic electron flow, a light-driven method of synthesizing ATP to power the Calvin cycle without generating oxygen. They lack photosystem II, and only have photosystem I—the only protein complex needed for cyclic electron flow. Because the job of bundle sheath chloroplasts is to carry out the Calvin cycle and make sugar, they often contain large starch grains.|$|E
2500|$|China's state-run General Administration of Press and Publication (新闻出版总署) screens all Chinese {{literature}} {{intended to}} be sold on the open market. The GAPP has the legal authority to screen, censor, and ban any print, electronic, or Internet publication in China. Because all publishers in China are required to be licensed by the GAPP, that agency also {{has the power to}} deny people the right to publish, and completely shut down any publisher who fails to follow its dictates. As a result, the ratio of official to unlicensed books is said to be 2:3. According to a report in ZonaEuropa, there are more than 4,000 underground publishing factories around China. The Chinese government continues to hold public book burnings on unapproved yet popular [...] "spiritual pollution" [...] literature, though critics claim this spotlight on individual titles only helps fuel booksales. Many new-generation Chinese authors who were the recipients of such government attention have been re-published in English and success in the western literary markets, namely Wei Hui's Shanghai Baby, Anchee Min's controversial memoir Red Azalea, Time Magazine banned-book covergirl Chun Sue's Beijing Doll, and Mian Mian's Candy.

2500|$|While the {{technical}} {{principles of the}} camera obscura have been known since antiquity, the broad use of {{the technical}} concept in producing images with a linear perspective in paintings, maps, theatre setups and architectural and later photographic images and movies started in the Western Renaissance and the scientific revolution. While e.g. Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) had already observed an optical effect and developed {{a state of the}} art theory of the refraction of light, he was less interested to produce images with it (compare Hans Belting 2005); the society he lived in was even hostile (compare Aniconism in Islam) towards personal images. Western artists and philosophers used the Arab findings in new frameworks of epistemic relevance. [...] E.g. Leonardo da Vinci used the camera obscura as a model of the eye, René Descartes for eye and mind and John Locke started to use the camera obscura as a metaphor of human understanding per se. The modern use of the camera obscura as an epistemic machine had important side effects for science.While the use of the camera obscura has dwindled away, for those who are interested in making one it only requires a few items including: a box, tracing paper, tape, foil, a box cutter, a pencil and a blanket to keep <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
2500|$|At the {{rehabilitation}} cell, Zelena reads [...] "Hansel and Gretel" [...] to her unborn child, {{before going into}} pain, screaming and banging on the door. Regina and Robin show up and they look at her pregnant body, which has accelerated by seven months (from two months), a result of Emma's dark magic. Zelena is {{rushed to the hospital}} and says that Emma did this with her onion rings. Dr. Whale is there and Zelena says tells him to get her [...] "angry baby" [...] out, and Whale reminds her about the last baby he delivered, which she tried to steal. He then mocks her, telling her that she must have realized that having a baby was so much more fun than stealing one. Regina asks why his hair is blonde and spiked, with Dr. Whale replying that since Emma changed her hairstyle, he though he could do the same as well. As Dr. Whale continues to joke about Zelena, Regina mutters that they [...] "really need a new doctor in this town." [...] Belle and Mary Margaret rush in and tell them that Emma is coming for the baby, and that the only thing she needs other than Excalibur to snuff <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> are the cries of a newborn child. Zelena begs Regina to take off the cuff so she can defend herself and her baby, but Regina says no. Zelena immediately delivers a baby girl, as Regina and Mary Margaret wait in the hall. Mary asks if Regina is ready to meet her new family, but she says she doesn’t know. As Robin hold the newborn, Emma appears, throwing Whale against the wall yet again. Robin and Regina prepare to fight her, but Emma reveals that she wants Zelena instead, and disappears with her.|$|E
2500|$|Dixon's [...] "Trilogy of Reconstruction" [...] {{consisted}} of The Leopard's Spots, The Clansman (1905), and The Traitor (1907). In these best-selling novels, which presented highly imaginative fiction as hard historical fact, Dixon used historical romance to present Negroes as inferior to whites and to glorify the antebellum American South. While he opposed slavery, {{he believed in}} racial segregation. Throughout his Reconstruction novels, Dixon painted a picture of white South victimized by greedy Northern carpetbaggers and black freedmen who are portrayed as [...] "black beasts" [...] full of an obsessive desire to rape white women. In his trilogy, Dixon portrayed Reconstruction as a nightmarish time when black men routinely stormed into weddings to rape white women, which is almost always avenged by the KKK castrating and lynching the said [...] "black beasts". Dixon conflated the possibility of any sort of advancement for African-Americans {{with the possibility of}} miscegenation, with the thesis frequently advanced in his novels that to allow black men to vote and have social equality would mean allowing black men to marry white women, which of course was portrayed as a monstrous prospect in his novels. In The Leopard's Spots, Dixon has one of his characters, the Reverend Durham, the mentor of the hero Charles Gaston say: [...] "One drop of Negro blood makes a Negro. It kinks the hair, flattens the nose, thickens the lip, puts <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of intellect, and lights the fires of brutal passions. The beginning of Negro equality as a vital fact {{is the beginning of the}} end of this nation's life. There is enough Negro blood here to make mulatto the whole Republic." [...] One critic, Andrew Leiter, noted that Dixon has Durham call marriage [...] "the holy of holies" [...] which needs to be protected from black men, which he noted was an [...] "intriguing term" [...] for marriage, which he suggested was a not too subtle reference to the vagina. Leiter argued that the way in Dixon always portrayed courtship and marriage as a one-way case of a man choosing a woman, the complete lack of concern about white men sleeping with black women, and the [...] "holy of holies" [...] remark suggested that Dixon's defense of white supremacy was due to his desire to maintain [...] "white male sexual proprietary rights".|$|E
