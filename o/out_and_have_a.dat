He played the character for its debut on the August 23 episode of Nitro in which KISS also played a live concert. He would play {{it one more time}} to come <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> staredown with Vampiro and abandoned it afterwards without wrestling.

500|$|The basidiocarps, {{or fruit}} bodies, of {{immature}} Gomphus clavatus are club-shaped and have one cap or pileus, but later spread <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> so-called merismatoid appearance—several vase-shaped caps rising {{from a common}} stem. The fruit body is up to [...] wide and [...] tall, fan-shaped with wavy edges. The upper surfaces of the fruit bodies are covered with brown hyphae (microscopic filaments) that form small, distinct patches towards the margin, but combine to form a continuous felt-like fine-haired area, or tomentum, over {{the center of the}} cap. The color of the upper cap surface is orange-brown to violet, but fades to a lighter brown with age. The cap margins of older mushrooms can be quite ragged. The lower spore-bearing surface—the hymenium—is wrinkled, often with folds and pits, and violet to brown in color. The solid stem, which is continuous with the cap, is [...] wide, [...] tall, and covered with fine hairs that become coarser (hispid) towards the base. It is often compound, with several fruit bodies arising from the basal portion. Fruit bodies may bruise reddish-brown where handled. The flesh can be whitish-pink to lilac or cinnamon-buff. Thick under the center of the cap, it thins out towards the margins. It can be crunchy, though it is softer than that of the chanterelle. The taste and odor are mild. The spore print is yellow to orange-yellow.|$|E

500|$|The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) {{characterized}} Hunt as [...] "confident", [...] "innovative", [...] "intelligent", {{while he}} {{also can be}} [...] "aggressive", [...] "brazen", [...] "presumptuous", [...] "hasty and rash". McKidd said of his character: [...] " [...] He's not an easy character to connect to, I think. There's some darkness to him and there's some danger to him that I think is really interesting and exciting to play. [...] " [...] Additionally, McKidd describes Hunt as [...] "very instinctive, and follows his gut, and he's very impulsive, and very immediate. He immediately assesses a situation. And he's very honest, sometimes painfully honest, with himself and with others. He wants to make himself better. He wants to improve himself as a person. He's a decent guy, {{a sort of a}} guy I'd like to go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> beer with." [...] Hunt's unorthodox teaching methods {{have been the subject of}} controversy. McKidd said of this: [...] The look of Owen has been described as hardcore and the antithesis of the other males on the show. McKidd says it's not just the look of Owen, but the fact that in his profession, he is dealing with life and death everyday. The one distinction he finds between his character and the others is that Owen does not care what other people think of him. When McKidd returned from his first appearance, his character appeared to have been changed. McKidd told TV Guide: [...] "Yes, that was who he really is in the premiere, but now we're seeing what can happen to a good man, a good soldier and good surgeon [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Telephone" [...] was {{originally}} written by Gaga for singer Britney Spears's sixth studio album, Circus (2008), but Spears's label rejected it. Later, Gaga recorded the song as a collaboration with Beyoncé for The Fame Monster. The song {{talks about the}} singer preferring the dance floor rather than answering her lover's call with the verses sung in a rapid-fire way, accompanied by double beats. Gaga explained that the song deals with her fear of suffocation, [...] "fear [...] never being able to enjoy myself. 'Cause I love my work so much, I find it really hard to go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good time." [...] In [...] "So Happy I Could Die", Gaga presents an ode to sexual feeling and actions, stating, [...] "I love that lavender blonde, The way she moves the way she walks, I touch myself, can't get enough." [...] Essentially a love song, the object of affection in [...] "So Happy I Could Die" [...] becomes Gaga herself as she talks about drinking, dancing, observing, and touching herself. Gaga's voice sounds sedated in the song. The song also uses Auto-Tune in the singer's vocals. The last song on The Fame Monster is [...] "Teeth", which contains gospel music and S style music composition.|$|E

Rabbi Krustofski then appears and tells Krusty that Jews {{do not believe in}} Heaven, and thus he should do more to help others. An act of kindness does not seem to make him happier, but Bart takes Krusty to the synagogue, where Rabbi Krustofski's favorite Rabbi recites Krusty's jokes on religion. Krusty therefore deduces that his father did find him funny, and sees him again in Jewish Heaven, where Jesus turns Dangerfield's water into a Bloody Mary.|$|R
