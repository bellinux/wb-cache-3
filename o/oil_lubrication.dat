The steam turbine generator, being rotating equipment, generally has a heavy, large-diameter shaft.

The bearing shells, in which the shaft rotates, are lined with a low-friction material like Babbitt metal. <b>Oil</b> <b>lubrication</b> is provided to further reduce the friction between shaft and bearing surface and to limit the heat generated.|$|E
2500|$|All Mazda-made Wankel rotaries, {{including}} the Renesis {{found in the}} RX-8, burn a small quantity of oil by design, metered into the combustion chamber to preserve the apex seals. Owners must periodically add small amounts of oil, thereby increasing running costs. Some sources, such as rotaryeng.net, claim that better results come {{with the use of}} an oil-in-fuel mixture rather than an oil metering pump. Liquid-cooled engines require a mineral multigrade oil for cold starts, and Wankel engines need a warm-up time before full load operation as reciprocating engines do. All engines exhibit oil loss, but the rotary engine is engineered with a sealed motor, unlike a piston engine that has a film of oil that splashes {{on the walls of the}} cylinder to lubricate them, hence an oil [...] "control" [...] ring.
