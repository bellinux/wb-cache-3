5|$|The Court {{makes it}} a federal crime for one lawful gun owner to buy a gun for another lawful gun owner. Whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> is a {{sensible}} result, the statutes Congress enacted do not support it—especially when, as is appropriate, we resolve ambiguity in those statutes {{in favor of the}} accused. I respectfully dissent.|$|E
5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In fact, I {{think one of the}} greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, they tend to be totalitarians, which means that they tend to destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, are you willing to create and live in a civil society, in an open society, <b>or</b> <b>not?</b> <b>That</b> to me is the basic issue.|$|E

5|$|The MTA also {{expressed}} interest in starting a pilot program to install platform edge doors. Several planned stations in the New York City Subway may possibly feature platform screen doors, possibly including future stations such as those part of the Second Avenue Subway. Currently, the MTA is planning a test program to install screen doors at a subway station on the BMT Canarsie Line. As part of the 2010–2014 capital program, the station {{was going to be}} Sixth Avenue, but it is uncertain whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> this will be the station chosen. Following a series of incidents during one week in November 2016, in which 3 people were injured or killed after being pushed onto the tracks, the MTA started to consider installing platform edge doors for the 42nd Street Shuttle.|$|E

25|$|An Independent Practice Association is a {{legal entity}} that {{contracts}} {{with a group of}} physicians to provide service to the HMO's members. Most often, the physicians are paid on a basis of capitation, which in this context means a set amount for each enrolled person assigned to that physician or group of physicians, whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> person seeks care. The contract is not usually exclusive so individual doctors or the group may sign contracts with multiple HMOs. Physicians who participate in IPAs usually also serve fee-for-service patients not associated with managed care.|$|E

Current students assert with pride that Harvard College, founded a year later in 1636, was created for Boston Latin's first graduates to attend and continue their education. Whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> is true, Boston Latin has been a top feeder school for Harvard, and has consistently sent large numbers of its graduates to Harvard, recently averaging about twenty-five students per year.

25|$|In the Internet of things, {{the precise}} {{geographic}} {{location of a}} thing—and also the precise geographic dimensions of a thing—will be critical. Therefore, facts about a thing, such as its location in time and space, have been less critical to track because the person processing the information can decide whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> information was important to the action being taken, and if so, add the missing information (or decide to not take the action). (Note that some things in the Internet of things will be sensors, and sensor location is usually important.) The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are promising applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location. However, the challenges that remain include the constraints of variable spatial scales, the need to handle massive amounts of data, and an indexing for fast search and neighbor operations. In the Internet of things, if things are able to take actions on their own initiative, this human-centric mediation role is eliminated. Thus, the time-space context that we as humans take for granted must be given {{a central role in}} this information ecosystem. Just as standards {{play a key role in}} the Internet and the Web, geospatial standards will play a key role in the Internet of things.|$|E

Whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> makes sense, the intuitive goal is clear: adding a 1 to the final 9 in 0.999... would carry all the 9s into 0s and leave a 1 in the ones place. Among other reasons, this idea fails because there is no [...] "final 9" [...] in 0.999.... However, there is a system that contains an infinite string of 9s including a last 9.|$|E

500|$|Alternative rock (also called {{alternative}} music, alt-rock {{or simply}} alternative) is {{a style of}} rock music {{that emerged from the}} independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s. In this instance, the word [...] "alternative" [...] refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, DIY ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, [...] "alternative" [...] {{has been used as a}} catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> <b>that</b> is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).|$|E
