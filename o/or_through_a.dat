5|$|In {{contrast}} to ion pumps, ion channels do not build chemical gradients but rather dissipate {{them in order}} to perform work or send a signal. Probably the most familiar and best studied example is the voltage-gated Na+ channel, which allows conduction of an action potential along neurons. All ion pumps have some sort of trigger or “gating” mechanism. In the previous example it was electrical bias, but other channels can be activated by binding a molecular agonist <b>or</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> conformational change in another nearby protein.|$|E
5|$|Warning {{coloration}} {{can succeed}} either through inborn behaviour (instinct) {{on the part}} of potential predators, <b>or</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> learned avoidance. Either can lead to various forms of mimicry. Experiments show that avoidance is learned in birds, mammals, lizards, and amphibians, but that some birds such as great tits have inborn avoidance of certain colours and patterns such as black and yellow stripes.|$|E
5|$|Ernest Augustus (5 June 1771– 18 November 1851) was King of Hanover from 20 June 1837 {{until his}} death. He {{was the fifth}} son and eighth child of King George III of the United Kingdom and Hanover. As a fifth son, Ernest seemed {{unlikely}} to become a monarch, but none of his four elder brothers had a legitimate son who survived infancy. The Salic Law, which barred succession to <b>or</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> female, prevailed in Hanover; therefore, when his elder brother King William IV died in 1837, Ernest succeeded him as King of Hanover. In the United Kingdom the succession to the monarchy was determined by primogeniture and his niece Victoria succeeded to the throne, thus ending the personal union between the British and Hanoverian crowns that had existed since 1714.|$|E

5|$|Like {{most major}} cities, Montreal needs easy highway access from its suburbs and {{surrounding}} areas. However, because Montreal {{was built on}} an island surrounded by three rivers, it can be entered by land only on a bridge <b>or</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> tunnel. Although the city was founded in 1642, it was not before 1847 that the first fixed link to the outside was established when a wooden bridge was built across Rivière des Prairies to Île Jésus, {{on the site of}} what is now Ahuntsic Bridge. Another bridge was built immediately afterward, a few kilometers west, which became Lachapelle Bridge, and another in 1849, Pont des Saints-Anges, to the east. The latter bridge collapsed in the 1880s and was never rebuilt.|$|E

The service has several features for the console, including the Virtual Console, WiiConnect24, Internet Channel, Forecast Channel, Everybody Votes Channel, News Channel and the Check Mii Out Channel. The Wii can also communicate (and connect) with other Wii systems through a self-generated wireless LAN, enabling local wireless multi-playing on different television sets. Battalion Wars 2 first demonstrated this feature for non-split screen multi-playing between two (or more) televisions.|$|E
5|$|The {{account of}} Southchurch's {{provisioning}} was first {{made available to}} a wider audience through {{the writings of the}} English historian Helen Cam. Cam was responsible for groundbreaking work on the Hundred Rolls, and their relevance to English local government, through her Studies in the Hundred Rolls (1921) and The Hundred and the Hundred Rolls (1930). In both of these she made mention of what she calls '...the most picturesque series of extortions recorded in the Essex returns.' It was, however, in a paper published in the English Historical Review as early as 1916 that she gave the most detailed account of Southchurch's plot. Here she traced the dissemination of the Viking legend through Geoffrey of Monmouth, and speculated that Southchurch could have been acquainted with a later version by Gaimar, Wace or Layamon, <b>or</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> local, popular legend.|$|E
