5000|$|... 1887At 2.30pm on 23 March 1887, an {{explosion}} at the mine in Bulli in New South Wales killed 81 people. A special commission {{was set up}} to investigate the explosion and concluded: [...].that the explosion was caused by marsh gas or carbonic hydrate that had accumulated at the face. That the immediate cause was probably the flame from an <b>overcharged</b> <b>shot</b> fired by a miner in the coal in No. 2 Heading. This gas explosion propagated a coal dust explosion and travelled towards the fresh air at the surface. The commission was also of the opinion that the Deputy, Overman {{and to a lesser extent}} the Manager, were all guilty of contributing negligence.|$|E
500|$|Players use the Xbox controller's left {{analog stick}} {{to move the}} character, the right stick to strafe, and the main buttons to jump, block, punch, and kick. When on offense, the latter two {{functions}} become [...] "pass" [...] and [...] "shoot". Players switch between characters and taunt with the white and black buttons, respectively, and call plays with the directional pad. The left trigger modifies an existing action, such as running into dives, slide-tackles, and grabs, and the right trigger orients the camera towards the objective (either the disc or the goal, depending on the team in possession). This camera control is designed for precision when diving for the disc or shooting on goal. A character in possession of the disc will show a trajectory line of their potential shot or pass, which is altered by player movement, breath, and physical contact. Players charge the disc by holding the shooting button, whereby the disc turns greener as the shot grows more powerful. A fully charged shot called a Deathrow will incapacitate any player it hits, while <b>overcharged</b> <b>shots</b> electrify and stun the carrier.|$|R
50|$|In Doom 3, the BFG 9000 is a charged weapon: {{holding down}} the trigger causes the weapon to {{accumulate}} energy before release, {{resulting in a}} more powerful <b>shot.</b> <b>Overcharging</b> the BFG too much will cause it to overheat and explode, killing the player instantly.|$|R
