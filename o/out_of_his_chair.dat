5|$|Meanwhile, Chris {{learns that}} his best customer, Herbert, has made Kyle, a neighbor's {{son and a}} bully, his new paper boy. Chris decides to confront them both but ends up getting pushed over by Kyle and laughed at by Kyle's friends {{subsequently}} returning home in tears much to Peter and Lois' concern. Peter goes to talk with Kyle who makes fun of him over and over. Unable to control his anger toward Kyle, Peter beats him up leaving Kyle bleeding and bruised. Kyle’s mother agrees not to press charges if Peter apologizes to Kyle which he reluctantly does. Kyle comments on how good bullying makes you feel which encourages Peter to become a bully. Peter splashes a {{pot of boiling water}} over Lois and makes her punch herself in the face. He also hits Stewie on his sunburned buttocks, knocks Chris <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> and sticks his large butt out at Meg to fart repeatedly in her face following her backwards around the kitchen table until she finally trips and vomits on the floor at which Peter gets mad with her. When Peter also bullies his friends, such as using Joe as a marionette and pulling Cleveland's pants down, Lois points out that he is as bad as his old school bully, Randy Fulcher. Deciding he should bully him instead, Peter finds Randy who is now suffering from multiple sclerosis. Thinking, when Randy says “I have MS,” that he is bragging that he has a monkey’s scrotum, Peter is about to beat up Randy but is stopped by Chris who beats Peter up instead and finally convinces him bullying is wrong. As the event is witnessed by a wrong sounding Kermit the Frog and a wrong sounding Swedish Chef, a wrong sounding Fozzie Bear (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) asks them if they want to hear a joke as the episode ends.|$|E
25|$|His first {{professional}} appearance in London was opposite Agnes Nicholls, in Wallfahrt nach Kevlaar by Engelbert Humperdinck at the St James's Hall, with the Handel Society under J. S. Liddle in late April 1903, and immediately afterwards he {{appeared at the}} Westmorland Festival. In June 1903 he was auditioned at the Royal College of Music in London by Charles Villiers Stanford, who left the room and brought Hubert Parry in to hear him as well. The violinist Professor Kruse, who was then attempting to revive the Saturday 'Pops' at the St James's Hall jumped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> and promptly engaged him, and it was Kruse who arranged for his first appearance in Edward Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius early in 1904 as an addition to his Beethoven Festival. Harry Plunket Greene, who had encouraged Elwes through this audition, also remained his lifelong friend.|$|E

"'97 Bonnie & Clyde", {{which was}} {{formerly}} {{featured on the}} Slim Shady EP as [...] "Just the Two of Us", was rerecorded for The Slim Shady LP to feature his daughter Hailie's vocals. Because the song focuses on disposing of his girlfriend's corpse, Eminem was not comfortable with explaining the situation to Kim, and instead {{told her that he}} would be taking Hailie to Chuck E. Cheese's. However, he really took her to the recording studio. He explained, [...] "When she found out I used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she fucking blew. We had just got back together for a couple of weeks. Then I played her the song and she bugged the fuck out." [...] Eminem also said, [...] "When she (Hailie) gets old enough, I'm going to explain it to her. I'll let her know that Mommy and Daddy weren't getting along at the time. None of it was to be taken too literally, although at the time I wanted to fucking do it." [...] The song [...] "Guilty Conscience" [...] contains a humorous reference to an occasion in which Dr. Dre assaulted rapper Dee Barnes. [...] Having only known Dr. Dre for a few days, Eminem was anxious about how he would react to such a line, and to his relief, Dr. Dre [...] "fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> laughing" [...] upon hearing the lyric.

2500|$|Rowe {{remained}} a popular attraction at clubs, corporate functions {{and on the}} [...] "rock-&-roll revival" [...] circuit in the 1990s. He also kept up regular appearances on TV variety shows. This led to one infamous incident in 1991 that briefly took {{him back into the}} headlines. During a forum on republicanism on the Midday Show with Ray Martin he was involved in an on-air melée with Sydney talkback-radio host Ron Casey. Notorious for his highly controversial comments on immigration and other issues, Casey enraged Normie with his remarks about his service in Vietnam and Normie confronted Casey by shoving him. Casey flew <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> and punched Rowe hard enough to knock Rowe backwards. In 1998, Casey and Rowe re-united, filming a TV commercial for Bushell's tea where the Midday incident was reflected upon.|$|E

On 12 October 2011, he was attacked by the members of Bhagat Singh Kranti Sena inside the Supreme Court complex, for these remarks. The group accused him of trying to break up India. He was dragged <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> and repeatedly kicked and punched. Bhushan described his attackers as having a [...] "fascist mindset" [...] and stood by his statements.

2500|$|In 1937 Pfeiffer {{would have}} to move again: he was forced <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> at Munich because of his {{marriage}} to a Jewish woman. He and Lili relocated to Oxford, where Pfeiffer gained a position in part due to the recommendation of Schwartz, who stated that Pfeiffer [...] "towered over all the other" [...] philologists of his generation. Eduard Fraenkel had already been driven from Germany to Corpus Christi, and with the addition of Pfeiffer The Oxford Magazine declared, [...] "Once more, Oxford gains what Nazi Germany has lost." [...] At Oxford Pfeiffer had access to the Callimachus fragments in the vast collection of Oxyrhynchus papyri and worked amicably with the great British papyrologist Edgar Lobel who had himself published valuable work on the poet. In his obiturary of Lobel, Sir Eric Gardner Turner wrote, [...] "The partnership over Callimachus with Rudolf Pfeiffer went well on both sides, and ended in mutual affection and esteem and a notable edition of the poet." [...] That edition of fragments, the first volume of Pfeiffer's magnum opus (1949), would be followed four years later by a second volume comprising the Hymns, Epigrams and testimonia.|$|E

2500|$|One night, at a {{club that}} served African Americans, a small fight {{resulted}} in the club owner calling the Shore Patrol. When the three white members of the Shore Patrol arrived—a Navy Chief, another enlisted sailor, and an army MP—the chief stayed with the vehicle while the other two entered the club. There, they [...] spotted a black sailor in an officer's uniform. Since impersonating an officer is a Federal offense, the MP went over to that man. The man suspected of [...] "impersonating an officer" [...] was actually Ensign Sam Gravely. When the MP told Ensign Gravely that the chief wanted to see him, Gravely replied, [...] "If the Chief wants to see me, tell him to come here."—following correct naval protocol for an enlisted man {{to come to an}} officer. The MP then grabbed Ensign Gravely <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b> [...] "Take it easy," [...] Ensign Gravely shouted to the other men in the club who were visibly upset; then added, [...] "This is only a mistake." [...] Then to the MP, he said, [...] "Let's go." [...] However, the word spread quickly that Ensign Gravely was being arrested. Black sailors converged on the MP and the Shore Patrol chief radioed for reinforcements. Two more Shore Patrol vehicles with more men soon arrived, to find Ensign Gravely trying to calm the men and explain the mistake to the Shore Patrol. However, Shore Patrol personnel in the two vehicles quickly emerged and forced a number of the PC-1264s crew into the trucks. Ensign Gravely got into the chief's vehicle, and all proceeded to Shore Patrol Headquarters.|$|E
50|$|A {{balancing}} tilt {{is highly}} advantageous since the user automatically controls the tilting {{movements of the}} chair without having to think about it. The user can concentrate on his/her activities and {{does not have to}} bother with mechanical regulation of the chair. The chair follows the natural inclinations of the body and automatically stabilises at the body’s selected sitting angles or at the angles that are required by the work task being done. The simplest way of verifying this is to try <b>out</b> one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>chairs</b> in front <b>of</b> a work table during a normal working day. The chair tilts forward when the user want to be active at the table and tilts backwards if the user wants to relax or talk on the telephone. Often such variations occur many times per minute.|$|R
5000|$|Holmes' {{contribution}} to the 1988 documentary {{is perhaps the most}} memorable, as he was interviewed while floating in a swimming pool, fully clothed and visibly quite intoxicated while his mother sat poolside. The interview stood out {{in stark contrast to the}} more light-hearted and humorous interviews conducted by director Penelope Spheeris, which mostly portrayed rockers as good-natured, though often dimwitted or deluded, party animals. During the interview, Holmes smiled drunkenly at the camera, deeming himself [...] "a full-blown alcoholic" [...] and [...] "a piece of crap" [...] despite his band's success, and punctuated his remarks by guzzling from three bottles of vodka. At the end of the interview, Holmes upends a full bottle <b>of</b> Smirnoff over <b>his</b> head as he rolls <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> inflatable <b>chair</b> and into the water.|$|R

60|$|Next, {{it must be}} {{recorded}} that {{the same day the}} gunboat Neptun, steering east, passed the brig Bonito becalmed in sight of Carimata, with her head to the eastward, too. Her captain, Jasper Allen, giving himself up consciously to a tender, possessive reverie <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Freya, did not get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> long <b>chair</b> on the poop to look at the Neptun which passed so close that the smoke belching out suddenly from her short black funnel rolled between the masts of the Bonito, obscuring for a moment the sunlit whiteness of her sails, consecrated to the service of love. Jasper did not even turn his head for a glance. But Heemskirk, on the bridge, had gazed long and earnestly at the brig from the distance, gripping hard the brass rail in front of him, till, the two ships closing, he lost all confidence in himself, and retreating to the chartroom, pulled the door to with a crash. There, his brows knitted, his mouth drawn on one side in sardonic meditation, he sat through many still hours--a sort of Prometheus in the bonds of unholy desire, having his very vitals torn by the beak and claws of humiliated passion.|$|R

50|$|During the Free For All pre-show Bret Hart, Jim Neidhart, Owen Hart, the British Bulldog and Brian Pillman {{were interviewed}} backstage, {{claiming}} they bought {{tickets for the}} show to watch the Stone Cold Steve Austin match later in the night. During the PPV Ahmed Johnson faced off against all {{three members of the}} Nation of Domination in a Gauntlet match. Before the match begun WWF president Gorilla Monsoon came to ringside and ejected any member of the Nation of Domination that was not wrestling, forcing manager Clarence Mason, D'Lo Brown and others to leave ringside. Johnson pinned Crush in the first match in just over five minutes. The second match ended in a disqualification when Savio Vega hit Johnson with a chair repeatedly. The deliberate disqualification was to set Johnson up as an easy victim for NOD leader Faarooq. Faarooq faked an arm injury and then quickly attacked Johnson's knee gaining a fast victory. The match between former Ultimate Fighting Championship champion Ken Shamrock and Vader featured mixed rules as a hybrid between wrestling and MMA that would only allow someone to win by submission or knock out. During the match Shamrock accidentally broke Vader's nose with a series of knee strikes to Vader's face. In the end Shamrock forced Vader to submit to an Ankle lock submission hold. The Hart Foundation made their presence known during the main event between The Undertaker and Steve Austin. At one point, when it looked like Austin was about to win, Pillman reached over and rang the bell prematurely, causing a distraction. In the end the Undertaker pinned Steve Austin, followed moments later by Neidhart, Owen Hart, Bulldog and Pillman attacking both wrestlers. Moments later Steve Austin knocked Bret Hart <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wheel <b>chair</b> and then used one of Hart's crutches as a weapon to chase {{all the members of the}} Hart Foundation off.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} Strider {{project was}} to create a {{mobility}} device that would support a person with weakened leg strength and allow them to push the device around with their legs and build more leg strength. There are many health benefits to standing and the Strider was intended to help a person with a disability experience these benefits. The Strider is a fully independent device that the user can get into and maneuver without assistance. The device is also safe, highly maneuverable, and complies with all ADA standards and requirements. The design is built around a frame that supports the user. A lowered push-off bar allows the user to push <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wheel <b>chair</b> and the frame supports the user’s weight. The user then uses the transfer seat to get into the device. The transfer seat locks in the downward position so the user can sit in it while getting into the harness. Once the harness is attached, the transfer seat can be unlocked and swung back <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way and the torso support system then is closed. At this point the harness supports the majority of the user’s weight and the user can now move the device around with his legs. Testing showed that a user can get into the device without help. However, the process is much more involved than originally believed, but with practice our user can learn how to transfer easily. The device moves very well for a person who is used to controlling their legs. However, for a person with less practice, accurately steering the Strider is a little trickier. Overall, the Strider fulfills the goals of the project. The user can get into the device and maneuver it around. The device also gives the user a workout. Future projects that are similar might want to look for alternative wheels that can provide better traction on smooth surfaces. This is especially important when the user is getting into the device and the brakes are on. As of now, the device slips a little on smooth floors while the user is getting into it. Lastly, having more adjustable arm rests would be beneficial...|$|R
