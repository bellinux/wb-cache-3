5|$|Rodin was a naturalist, less {{concerned}} with monumental expression than with character and emotion. Departing with centuries of tradition, {{he turned away from}} the idealism of the Greeks, and the decorative beauty of the Baroque and neo-Baroque movements. His sculpture emphasized the individual and the concreteness <b>of</b> <b>flesh,</b> <b>and</b> suggested emotion through detailed, textured surfaces, and the interplay of light and shadow. To a greater degree than his contemporaries, Rodin believed that an individual's character was revealed by his physical features.|$|E

5|$|The name durian {{comes from}} the Malay word duri (thorn) {{together}} with the suffix -an (for building a noun in Malay). D. zibethinus is the only species commercially cultivated {{on a large scale}} and available outside of its native region. Since this species is open-pollinated, it shows considerable diversity in fruit colour and odour, size <b>of</b> <b>flesh</b> <b>and</b> seed, and tree phenology. In the species name, zibethinus refers to the Indian civet, Viverra zibetha. There is disagreement regarding whether this name, bestowed by Linnaeus, refers to civets being so fond of the durian that the fruit was used as bait to entrap them, or to the durian smelling like the civet.|$|E
5|$|Christof, Pink, and Lily {{travel to}} New York City aboard a {{contraband}} ship, rescue the Nosferatu Samuel from the Sabbat, and infiltrate a warehouse storing the Vyšehrad contraband. There they encounter Wilhem, {{who is now}} a Sabbat under Ecaterina following the collapse of their group. Wilhem reveals that Pink is an assassin working for Vukodlak. Pink escapes and Wilhem rejoins Christof, hoping to reclaim the humanity he has sacrificed during the previous 800 years. Together, Christof, Wilhem, Lily, and Samuel discover that Vukodlak is hidden beneath a church within his Cathedral <b>of</b> <b>Flesh</b> <b>and</b> that Anezka is still in his servitude. In the cathedral they find that Vukodlak has awoken; he tries to influence Christof by offering him Anezka then revealing that she is completely dependent on Vukodlak's blood and will die without him. Christof refuses and Vukodlak drops the group into tunnels beneath the cathedral. Christof finds the Wall of Memories, which hold Anezka's memories of the last millennia, showing she continued to hope as Vukodlak found new ways to defile and torment her. She eventually sacrificed her innocence to gain Vukodlak's trust, using her position to delay his resurrection over hundreds of years until, with no options left, she prayed for Christof's return. The group returns to the Cathedral and battles Vukodlak.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{contrasting}} views {{regarding the}} marital status of Tulsidas. According to the Mula Gosain Charita {{and some other}} works, Tulsidas was married to Ratnavali on the thirteenth day of the bright half of the Jyeshta month (May–June) in Vikram 1583 (1526 CE). Ratnavali {{was the daughter of}} Dinbandhu Pathak, a Brahmin of the Bharadwaja Gotra, who belonged to Mahewa village of Kaushambi district. They had a son named Tarak who died as a toddler. Once when Tulsidas had gone to a Hanuman temple, Ratnavali went to her father's home with her brother. When Tulsidas came to know this, he swam across the Yamuna river in the night to meet his wife. Ratnavali chided Tulsidas for this, and remarked that if Tulsidas was even half as devoted to God as he was to her body <b>of</b> <b>flesh</b> <b>and</b> blood, he would have been redeemed. Tulsidas left her instantly and left for the holy city of Prayag. Here, he renounced the Grihastha (householder's life) stage and became a Sadhu (Hindu ascetic).|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Claire is {{reunited with}} Sherry and discovers that the mutated Birkin has {{implanted}} his daughter with an embryo to produce offspring. Leon, Ada, Claire and Sherry advance through an abandoned factory connected to Umbrella's secret underground research facility. An attack by Birkin leaves Ada heavily wounded, and Leon explores the laboratory {{to find something}} to treat her wounds. He is interrupted by a psychotic Annette, who explains to him that Ada's relationship with John was only a means of getting information about Umbrella: Ada is a spy sent to steal the G-virus for an unknown organization. Just as Annette is about to shoot Leon, the Tyrant appears, and she is forced to retreat. Ada returns to save Leon and battles the Tyrant – which falls into a pit of molten metal – seemingly at the cost of her own life. She confesses her love to Leon, who leaves behind her motionless body. Meanwhile, Annette tries to escape with another sample of the G-virus but is fatally wounded by her mutated husband. However, before she dies, she tells Claire how to create a vaccine that will stop the mutations caused by the embryo within Sherry. After preparing the cure, Leon and Claire reunite at an emergency escape train and inject Sherry with the vaccine, which saves her life. En route, Leon is assisted in terminating the now-mutated Tyrant by a woman in shadow, implying Ada's survival and escape with the G-virus in the pendant. Birkin– now mutated into a large agglomeration <b>of</b> <b>flesh</b> <b>and</b> teeth– follows the protagonists, but is destroyed when a self-destruct system causes the train to explode. After escaping from the city with Sherry, Leon intends to take down Umbrella, while Claire continues to search for her brother. Hunk, one of the special agents sent by Umbrella, is able to successfully complete his G-virus retrieval mission.|$|E

The shape of the teeth would have made Lythronax an efficient hunter; {{it would have been}} able to carve out huge chunks <b>of</b> <b>flesh</b> <b>and</b> bone and swallow whole.|$|E

25|$|September: Graham Allen, 27. Allen was a 27-year-old father-of-one, {{originally}} from Motherwell, whom Nilsen encountered in Shaftesbury Avenue as Allen attempted to hail a taxi in September 1982. Allen was strangled with a ligature {{as he sat}} eating an omelette Nilsen had cooked for him. His body was identified from dental records and healed fractures to his jawbone.

25|$|First Márton Kálmáncsehi Sánta who {{was elected}} town pastor of Debrecen in 1551 denied openly the real {{presence}} <b>of</b> <b>Flesh</b> <b>and</b> Blood of Christ in the Eucharist. Next at a synod of 1559, held in Marosvásárhely (Târgu Mureş, Romania), Hungarian ministers agreed that communion services were to be held merely as memorials of Christ's death. The right of each parish to freely align itself with either the Calvinist or the Lutheran views on Eucharist was decreed in John II Sigismund's realm in 1564.|$|E
25|$|At 7:30a.m. the {{following}} morning, Cattran and Wheeler returned to 23 Cranley Gardens, {{by which time}} the drain had been cleared. This aroused the suspicions of both the drain inspector and his supervisor. Cattran discovered some scraps <b>of</b> <b>flesh</b> <b>and</b> four bones in a pipe leading from the drain which linked to the top flat of the house. To both Cattran and Wheeler, the bones {{looked as if they}} originated from a human hand. Both men immediately called the police who, upon closer inspection, discovered further small bones and scraps of what looked to the naked eye like either human or animal flesh in the same pipe leading from the drain. These remains were taken to the mortuary at Hornsey, where pathologist Professor David Bowen advised police that the remains were indeed human, and that one particular piece of flesh he concluded had been from a human neck bore a ligature mark.|$|E

25|$|Another {{behavior}} {{observed in}} D. media workers is gastral vibration. This is observed in workers of many Dolichovespula and Vespula species. Workers tap their gaster rapidly {{up and down}} onto the comb of the nest and this is associated with feeding of larvae. The behavior typically occurs while wasps are walking on the comb and ceases after feeding each larvae a small amount <b>of</b> <b>flesh</b> <b>and</b> then resumes before feeding the next larvae. A behavior {{that appears to be}} homologous to this is observed in the foundresses queen and is called tapping. Queens have been observed tapping mid or hind legs on the comb after returning with prey. These taps can last a few seconds to a couple minutes and are loud enough to be heard outside of the nest. This signal is believed to function {{in the same way as}} gastral vibration in workers and is to signal to the larvae when it is time to feed. Sometimes this tapping or vibration occurs even when there is no pellet to feed the larvae and it is speculated that this corresponds to the feeding of liquids, but this has not been confirmed. Tapping continues in the queen even after she has ceased foraging when she feeding larvae pellets that she receives from the workers. This supports the idea that it is involved in signaling larvae during feeding.|$|E
25|$|As {{earlier with}} Perugino and others, Raphael {{was able to}} {{assimilate}} the influence of Florentine art, whilst keeping his own developing style. Frescos in Perugia of about 1505 show a new monumental quality in the figures which may represent the influence of Fra Bartolomeo, who Vasari says {{was a friend of}} Raphael. But the most striking influence in the work of these years is Leonardo da Vinci, who returned to the city from 1500 to 1506. Raphael's figures begin to take more dynamic and complex positions, and though as yet his painted subjects are still mostly tranquil, he made drawn studies of fighting nude men, one of the obsessions of the period in Florence. Another drawing is a portrait of a young woman that uses the three-quarter length pyramidal composition of the just-completed Mona Lisa, but still looks completely Raphaelesque. Another of Leonardo's compositional inventions, the pyramidal Holy Family, was repeated in a series of works that remain among his most famous easel paintings. There is a drawing by Raphael in the Royal Collection of Leonardo's lost Leda and the Swan, from which he adapted the contrapposto pose of his own Saint Catherine of Alexandria. He also perfects his own version of Leonardo's sfumato modelling, to give subtlety to his painting <b>of</b> <b>flesh,</b> <b>and</b> develops the interplay of glances between his groups, which are much less enigmatic than those of Leonardo. But he keeps the soft clear light of Perugino in his paintings.|$|E
