5|$|In 1915 the 8th Battalion {{joined the}} British Army in France {{as part of}} the 3rd Canadian Division. At the Second Battle of Ypres his troops faced the brunt of the German assault, {{involving}} the first use <b>of</b> <b>poison</b> gas in modern warfare. Lipsett is credited with issuing the first order to counteract the effects <b>of</b> <b>poison</b> gas, when he ordered his men to urinate on strips of cloth and tie them to their faces to neutralise the chlorine. Lipsett's battalion was instrumental in holding the line during the action and he was consequently rewarded by being made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, promoted to acting brigadier-general and given command of the Canadian 2nd Brigade, which he trained during the spring of 1916 to conduct major trench raids on German lines.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Poisoning is {{a common}} medico-social problem. It is a {{significant}} contributor to morbidity and mortality. Our study {{is to determine the}} socio demographic profile <b>of</b> the <b>poisoning</b> cases reported and to find out the pattern <b>of</b> <b>poisoning</b> cases at a tertiary care hospital in rural set up. Method: Participants comprised <b>of</b> acute <b>poisoning</b> admissions to the emergency of UPRIMS and R, Saifai, Etawah, U. P. during 8 months period. Data regarding pattern <b>of</b> <b>poisoning,</b> basic demographics and drug utilization were collected by retrospective review of patient records. Results: Major poisoning cases were observed in the age group between 21 - 30 years (39. 09 %). The populations with possibility <b>of</b> exposure to <b>poisoning</b> in their occupations were farmers (41. 5 %), housewives (31. 2 %) and students (18. 8 %). The maximum numbers <b>of</b> <b>poisoning</b> cases reported were due to organophosphorus (57. 1 %). The number <b>of</b> intentional <b>poisoning</b> cases (91. 9 %) were more when compared to accidental poisoning cases (5. 2 %). Conclusion: Prevailing treatment protocols require updating on proper guidelines for better management <b>of</b> <b>poisoning.</b> Pattern and magnitude <b>of</b> <b>poisoning</b> are multidimensional and demand multi-sectoral approach for facing this problem. There is need for stringent pesticide regulation laws and counselling and training programs to reduce incidence of poisonings. " [Natl J Community Med 2016; 7 (4. 000) : 307 - 310...|$|R

40|$|An {{epidemiology}} study <b>of</b> <b>poisoning</b> {{was done}} in a geographically defined area in rural Sri Lanka, a developing agricultural country. The incidence <b>of</b> <b>poisoning</b> was 75 per 100000 population and the death rate was very high (22 per 100000 population). Both were highest in the age group 15 - 34 and there were significant ethnic differences in the incidence <b>of</b> <b>poisoning.</b> Agrochemicals were responsible for 59 % of all poisonings. Paraquat was the commonest poisoning agent with a high fatality rate of 68 %. Use of highly toxic agents may have resulted in deaths {{where there was no}} intention to commit suicide. Strict legislation regarding the sale, distribution and storage of agrochemicals could result in the reduction of mortality and perhaps the incidence <b>of</b> <b>poisoning,</b> in developing agricultural countries. Sri Lanka is a developing agricultural country in South East Asia. There has been an increase in the use of agro-chemicals making them freely available in the community.

40|$|BACKGROUND : Poisoning {{with various}} {{substances}} {{is an important}} cause of death and disability worldwide. The types <b>of</b> <b>poisons</b> that are encountered in the emergency medicine departments encompass {{a wide range of}} substances. Apparently, geographic location, socio - demographic factors, ease <b>of</b> availability <b>of</b> <b>poisons</b> and many other cryptic factors contribute to the wide spectrum of substances that cause poisoning. Pesticides, drugs and chemicals are reported to be the most commo nly used poisons in India. Management <b>of</b> <b>poisoning</b> is quite challenging for the health care professionals globally. Factors such as the uncertainty in the identification <b>of</b> allegedly consumed <b>poison,</b> varied clinical features and the need for timely access to specific information for treatment, complicates poisoning management. This study was therefore conducted to explore the clinical features, management and outcomes <b>of</b> <b>poisoning</b> cases reporting to a tertiary care centre in south India. OBJECTIVE : To ident ify the spectrum <b>of</b> <b>poisons</b> and evaluate their clinical manifestations, medical management and clinical outcomes. METHODOLOGY : All cases <b>of</b> <b>poisoning</b> that were reported at a tertiary care hospital in South India for a period of 18 months from January 1, 20 13 to June 30, 2014 were included in this study. A data abstraction sheet was designed to document demographic details (age and gender), <b>poison</b> consumed, duration <b>of</b> stay in the hospital, clinical features, treatment administered, need for life support and patient outcomes. RESULTS : A total <b>of</b> 145 <b>poisoning</b> cases were reported during the study period. Among them, 58. 5...|$|R

5|$|A second form of mimicry {{occurs when}} two aposematic organisms {{share the same}} anti-predator {{adaptation}} and mimic each other, {{to the benefit of}} both species, since fewer individuals of either species need to be attacked for predators to learn to avoid both of them. This form of mimicry is known as Müllerian mimicry, after Fritz Müller, a German naturalist who studied the phenomenon in the Amazon in the late 19th century. Many species of bee and wasp that occur together are Müllerian mimics; their similar colouration teaches predators that a striped pattern is associated with being stung. Therefore, a predator which has had a negative experience with any such species will likely avoid any that resemble it in the future. Müllerian mimicry is found in vertebrates such as the mimic poison frog (Ranitomeya imitator) which has several morphs throughout its natural geographical range, each of which looks very similar to a different species <b>of</b> <b>poison</b> frog which lives in that area.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the large}} number of {{introduced}} species that harm Lord Howe's native flora and fauna, feral pigs and cats were eradicated by the early 2000s. The goat population has been reduced to just a few animals, and there are ongoing efforts to control rodents and introduced plants. In July 2012 it was announced by the Australian federal Environment Minister Tony Burke and the New South Wales Environment Minister Robyn Parker that the Australian and NSW Governments would each contribute 50% of the estimated A$9 million cost of implementing a rodent eradication plan for the island, using aerial deployment <b>of</b> <b>poison</b> baits. The plan was put to a local vote and is considered controversial. A recovery program has restored the Lord Howe woodhen numbers from only 20 in 1970 to about 200 in 2000, which is close to carrying capacity.|$|E
