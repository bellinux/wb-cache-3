60|$|There was {{a private}} {{cabriolet}} in waiting; the groom <b>opened</b> the <b>apron,</b> and jumped out to the horse's head.|$|R
60|$|There was no response. The cabby threw <b>open</b> the <b>apron</b> {{of the cab}} {{and gently}} shook the {{recumbent}} figure.|$|R
60|$|The cab {{pulled up}} with a jerk, and a commissionaire threw <b>open</b> the <b>apron.</b> Douglas handed his {{companion}} out, and they entered the restaurant together. In a distant corner they found a table to themselves, and he ordered dinner.|$|R
6000|$|He added this {{question}} in a soothing tone, as he saw her eyes widening sorrowfully, and {{the corners of her}} mouth falling. She said nothing at first; she only <b>opened</b> her <b>apron</b> and looked down at her apricots and sweetmeats. Then she looked up at him again and said complainingly-- ...|$|R
50|$|With {{construction}} spanning over {{a decade}} and led by Chief Engineer of the State Harbor Commission, Frank G. White, Piers 1, 1½, 3 and 5, were opened in 1918. Unlike the piers south of the Ferry Building that were designed in the Mission and Gothic Revival styles, the piers north of the Ferry Building {{were built in the}} Beaux-Arts architecture style, similar to New York City's Chelsea Piers. The timber-frame bulkhead buildings, covered in stucco, are each two stories high, punctuated by two-story arches. Behind these formal building are the areas more closely associated with the functioning of the port - the piers and transit sheds. Concrete or timber piers extend east behind the bulkhead buildings, connected to the system of wharves upon which the bulkhead buildings rest. Steel truss and timber frame buildings, accommodating the loading and unloading of ships are built upon the piers, with <b>open</b> <b>aprons</b> for circulation.|$|R
50|$|The {{terminal}} had a scalloped roofline, {{allowing a}} column-free interior. All services - ticketing, baggage claim and concessions, {{were inside the}} building, and a single departure lounge <b>opened</b> onto the <b>apron.</b>|$|R
60|$|Jose {{did exactly}} as the horse told him, and {{everything}} fell {{out as the}} animal prophesied; {{so that it was}} not until they were galloping breathlessly towards the palace that the princess knew that she was taken captive. She said nothing, however, but quietly <b>opened</b> her <b>apron</b> which contained the bran for the chickens, and in a moment it lay scattered on the ground.|$|R
60|$|At {{this they}} both laughed; the {{secretary}} so vehemently, that in kicking up his feet, he kicked the <b>apron</b> <b>open,</b> and nearly started Cauliflower's brother into an oyster shop; {{not to mention}} Mr Bailey's receiving such a sudden swing, that he held on for a moment quite a young Fame, by one strap and no legs.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006 the 109 m tall {{control tower}} started operating. It allows a free {{overview}} of the entire airport area and offers a night laser show, which should welcome the passengers even from the aircraft. From 2004-2007 an Office Park had been erected offering [...] of rentable space. A VIP- and general aviation-terminal, including a separated <b>apron,</b> <b>opened</b> in 2006.|$|R
6000|$|The Bacteriologist {{from his}} cab beamed curiously {{at him through}} his spectacles. [...] "You have drunk it! An Anarchist! I see now." [...] He {{was about to say}} {{something}} more, and then checked himself. A smile hung {{in the corner of his}} mouth. He <b>opened</b> the <b>apron</b> of his cab as if to descend, at which the Anarchist waved him a dramatic farewell and strode off towards Waterloo Bridge, carefully jostling his infected body against as many people as possible. The Bacteriologist was so preoccupied with the vision of him that he scarcely manifested the slightest surprise at the appearance of Minnie upon the pavement with his hat and shoes and overcoat. [...] "Very good of you to bring my things," [...] he said, and remained lost in contemplation of the receding figure of the Anarchist.|$|R
60|$|The noise she made, {{pounding}} {{upon the}} door, and her yells {{of anger and}} dreadful threats of vengeance, filled all our friends with terror, and Woot the Monkey was so excited that in the dark {{he could not find}} the outer door of the hall. But the Tin Owl could see very nicely in the dark, so he guided his friends to the right place and when all were grouped before the door Woot commanded it to <b>open.</b> The Magic <b>Apron</b> proved as powerful as when it had been worn by the Giantess, so a moment later they had rushed through the passage and were standing in the fresh night air outside the castle, free to go wherever they willed.|$|R
5000|$|The story {{opens in}} the town of B., where things are drab, {{depressing}} and boring until a cavalry regiment moves into the area. Once the regiment is stationed {{in the town}}, the area becomes lively, animated, and full of color, with neighboring landowners coming into town frequently to socialize with officers and attend various gatherings and parties. One of the landowners and a chief aristocrat, Pythagoras Chertokutsky, attends a party at the general's house. When the general shows off his beautiful mare to the party attendees, Chertokutsky mentions he has a splendid coach that he paid around four-thousand rubles for, hoping to impress the other guests (although in reality he owns nothing of the sort). The other men express interest in seeing the carriage, so he invites them to dinner on the following day. During the remainder of the general’s party, he gets caught up in playing cards and forgets the time, getting home around four in the morning, drunk. Because of this, he forgets to tell his wife about the party and is roused from sleep when his wife sees some carriages approaching their house. He at once remembers the dinner party that he agreed to host, but has his servants tell everyone that he is gone for the day, going to hide in the coach. The general and his friends are upset by his absence, but wish to see his magnificent coach anyway and go to the carriage house to look at it. They are unimpressed by the ordinary coach that he actually owns and examine it thoroughly, wondering if maybe there is something special hidden inside. They <b>open</b> the <b>apron</b> inside the coach and find Chertokutsky hiding inside. The general simply exclaims [...] "Ah, you are here," [...] slams the door, and covers him up again with the apron.|$|R
40|$|An open-roofed plastic {{isolator}} {{was built}} in a single patient isolation room in a burn unit. It was designed to prevent contact contamination only, as this had {{been shown to be}} the important route of cross-colonization in the unit. To exclude any possible effect on airborne transfer of bacteria, the isolator was first examined by means of an airborne particle tracer of the same size as bacteria-carrying particles. Such experiments indicated that the isolator might prevent some transfer out of but not into the isolator. This was not confirmed in simulated nursing experiments nor in a patient study, where the air counts of bacteria were practically the same inside and outside the isolator wall. Two patients only were nursed in the isolator. Both patients acquired exogenous colonizations from other patients, one with Ps. aeruginosa and the other with S. aureus. Nursing in the isolator was difficult and staff-demanding. In simulated nursing experiments, plastic aprons and gauntlets as the only protective measures against contact contamination gave as much protection to a mock patient as did the isolator. S. aureus were released from nurses' clothes more easily during work with the isolator than in <b>open</b> nursing with <b>aprons</b> and gauntlets. In conclusion, the isolator {{did not seem to be}} a realistic alternative to impermeable clothes such as plastic aprons as a means of preventing clothes-borne cross-contamination between burn patients...|$|R
6000|$|Next time old Hasluck {{knocked at}} our front door a maid in cap and <b>apron</b> <b>opened</b> it to him, {{and this was}} but the {{beginning}} of change. New oilcloth glistened in the passage. Lace curtains, such as in that neighbourhood were the hall-mark of the plutocrat, advertised our rising fortunes to the street, and greatest marvel of all, at least to my awed eyes, my father's Sunday clothes came into weekday wear, new ones taking {{their place in the}} great wardrobe that hitherto had been the stronghold of our gentility; to which we had ever turned for comfort when rendered despondent by contemplation of the weakness of our outer walls. [...] "Seeing that everything was all right" [...] is how my mother would explain it. She would lay the lilac silk upon the bed, fondly soothing down its rustling undulations, lingering lovingly over its deep frosted flounces of rich Honiton. Maybe she had entered the room weary looking and depressed, but soon there would proceed from her a gentle humming as from some small winged thing when the sun first touches it and warms it, and sometimes by the time the Indian shawl, which could go through a wedding ring, but never would when it was wanted to, had been refolded and fastened again with the great cameo brooch, and the poke bonnet, like some fractious child, shaken and petted into good condition, she would be singing softly to herself, nodding her head to the words: which were generally to the effect that somebody was too old and somebody else too bold and another too cold, [...] "so he wouldn't do for me;" [...] and stepping lightly as though the burden of the years had fallen from her.|$|R
