5|$|Each worm {{begins the}} round with a {{specific}} amount of health, which is predefined by the chosen game options or by scripting in campaign levels. When hit with a weapon, the worm will lose health depending upon the power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> and the directness of the hit. A worm can be killed either by exploding after having its health reduced to zero or by being knocked into the water around and below the level.|$|E
50|$|Following <b>the</b> {{dissolution}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, Ukraine had on {{its territory}} the world's third largest nuclear weapons stockpile. While Ukraine had physical control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapons,</b> {{it did not}} have operational control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> as they were dependent on Russian-controlled electronic Permissive Action Links and the Russian command and control system. In 1994 Ukraine agreed to <b>the</b> destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapons,</b> and to join the NPT.|$|R

5|$|M249s {{have seen}} action {{in every major}} {{conflict}} involving the United States since the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989. Due to the weight and age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon,</b> the United States Marine Corps is fielding the M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle with plans to partially replace the M249 in Marine Corps service.|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than try}} to fit more guns onto a ship, it was {{possible}} to increase the power of each gun. This could be done by increasing either the calibre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> and hence the weight of shell, or by lengthening the barrel to increase muzzle velocity. Either of these offered the chance to increase range and armour penetration.|$|E
5|$|The M249 is a belt-fed {{light machine}} gun. It fires the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge, usually a {{combination}} of one M856 tracer and four M855 ball cartridges fed from M27 linked belts. Belts are typically held in a hard plastic or soft canvas box attached to the underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|E

50|$|The CVN 21 {{class was}} {{designed}} to have better weapons movement paths, largely eliminating horizontal movements within the ship. Current plans call for advanced weapons elevators to move from storage areas to dedicated weapons-handling areas. Sailors would use motorized carts to move <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> from storage to the elevators at different levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> magazines. Linear motors are being considered for <b>the</b> advanced <b>weapons</b> elevators. <b>The</b> elevators will also be relocated such {{that they will not}} impede aircraft operations on the flight deck. <b>The</b> redesign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> movement paths and <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> elevators on <b>the</b> flight deck will reduce manpower and contribute to a much higher sortie generation rate.|$|R
5|$|The {{standard}} squad {{automatic weapon}} in Afghanistan is the M249 with PIP kit, which serves alongside its heavier counterpart, the M240 machine gun. Most M249s {{were given a}} collapsible buttstock immediately prior to the invasion to reduce its length and make the weapons more practical for parachuting and close-quarters combat. Special Operations troops typically favor the shorter Para version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon,</b> which weighs much less.|$|E
5|$|To {{initiate}} {{firing the}} weapon the trigger mechanism, which was essentially just a large spring, {{had to be}} cocked, and to do this was a difficult and awkward process. The user had to first place the PIAT on its butt, then place two feet on the shoulder padding and turn the weapon to unlock the body and simultaneously lock the firing pin to the butt; the user would then have to bend over and pull the body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> upwards, thereby pulling the spring back until it attached to the trigger and cocking the weapon. Once this was achieved, the body was then lowered and turned to reattach it to the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon,</b> and the PIAT could then be fired. Users of a small stature often found the cocking sequence challenging, as {{they did not have}} the sufficient height required to pull the body up far enough to cock the weapon; it was also difficult to do when lying in a prone position, as was often the case when using the weapon in action.|$|E
5|$|While George Kistiakowsky's Explosives Division (X Division) {{developed}} the explosive lenses, G Division designed the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon.</b> There were numerous difficulties to overcome, {{not the least}} of which was devising a means of detonating the lenses with the required speed. Robert F. Christy's solid core design was chosen as the most likely design to succeed.|$|E

5|$|Forensic firearm {{examination}} is {{the forensic}} process of examining {{the characteristics of}} firearms {{as well as any}} cartridges or bullets left behind at a crime scene.

5|$|From the 12th century on, the {{crossbow}} (called , tzangra in Greek) {{became increasingly}} important in Mediterranean warfare, remaining the most deadly weapon available until {{the advent of}} fully rigged ships with gunpowder artillery. The Byzantines made infrequent use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon,</b> chiefly in sieges, although its use is recorded in some sea battles. Cannons were introduced {{in the latter half}} of the 14th century, but they were rarely used by the Byzantines, who only had a few artillery pieces for the defence of the land walls of Constantinople. Unlike the Venetians and Genoese, there is no indication that the Byzantines ever mounted any on ships.|$|E
5|$|In January 1937, the Ordnance Committee {{recommended}} {{development of}} such a weapon; two PaK 36 guns were acquired for study. As the projected main user <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon,</b> the Infantry Branch was chosen to oversee the work. They wanted a lightweight gun that could be moved around by the crew, so any ideas of using a larger caliber {{than that of the}} German gun were discarded. The 37mm was a popular caliber of anti-tank guns in the 1930s; other anti-tank guns of the same caliber included Swedish Bofors gun, Czechoslovakian vz. 34 and vz. 37, Japanese Type 94 and Type 1.|$|E
5|$|In May 1945 an Interim Committee {{was created}} to advise and report on wartime and postwar {{policies}} {{regarding the use of}} nuclear energy. The Interim Committee in turn established a scientific panel consisting of Arthur Compton, Fermi, Lawrence and Oppenheimer to advise it on scientific issues. In its presentation to the Interim Committee the scientific panel offered its opinion not just on the likely physical effects of an atomic bomb, but on its likely military and political impact. This included opinions on such sensitive issues as whether or not the Soviet Union should be advised <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> in advance of its use against Japan.|$|E

25|$|The {{power and}} nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> varies, {{and is not}} fully {{understood}} in all cases. <b>The</b> smallest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> {{seem to have been}} considerably more powerful than conventional space-borne weapons, and at least one is deemed capable of destroying a planet-sized object from a distance exceeding 100 AU. It is suggested that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> can have negative effects upon stellar bodies. Their level of sophistication differs widely—the most basic cache weapons appear to be radical extensions of otherwise conventional principles, such as relativistic projectile weapons with antimatter or neutronium ammunition and gamma-ray lasers. Others, however, make use of gravity wave effects and other complex phenomena, with certain weapons even containing microscopic black holes. Once a weapon is programmed to fire, the process cannot be stopped by any method short of destroying it. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> appear to be single use, including some deployed in the novel Absolution Gap (in several cases this is because <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> destroys itself when firing), while others are at least theoretically capable of being reloaded, though this is never attempted.|$|R
5|$|Juste {{primarily}} attacks {{at close}} quarters using the series' traditional whip weapon, the Vampire Killer. It can be brandished to deflect projectile attacks, reminiscent of Simon Belmont's usage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> in Super Castlevania IV. A variety of ranged sub-weapons—holy water, a dagger, a holy book, a cross, a gem, an axe, and a thunder gauntlet—are available, {{one of which}} can be carried at any given time and combined with one of the five spell books—Fire Book, Ice Book, Bolt Book, Wind Book, and the Summoning Tome—hidden throughout the castle to create a magical attack. Casting a spell renders the player character invincible for a moment.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, {{a space station}} located near a stable {{wormhole}} between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy. In this episode, Kor returns to the station to recruit Lt. Cmdr. Worf (Michael Dorn) and Lt. Cmdr. Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) to help to find the ancient Sword of Kahless. After they find the sword, {{they are forced to}} evade the forces of Toral (Rick Pasqualone), Son of Duras, and Worf and Kor come to blows over the future use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Spent {{cartridges}} {{found at}} a scene can be examined for physical evidence such as fingerprints or compared to samples that match them to a weapon. The examination of the cartridge relies on the unique tool marks left by the various parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> including the firing pin and the ejector in semi and fully automatic firearms. These markings can be compared and matched to known exemplars fired from the same weapon using the same parts. The examination of the marks left on the cartridge is done using a comparison microscope. Examiners view the questioned cartridge and the known exemplar simultaneously, looking for similar microscopic marks left during the firing process.|$|E
