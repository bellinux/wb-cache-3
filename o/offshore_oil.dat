Offshore platforms and drilling rigs extract the oil or gas and store it for transport to land. <b>Offshore</b> <b>oil</b> and gas production can be difficult due to the remote, harsh environment. Drilling for oil in the sea has environmental impacts. Animals may be disorientated by seismic waves used to locate deposits, probably causing the beaching of whales. Toxic substances such as mercury, lead, and arsenic may be released. The infrastructure may cause damage and oil may be spilt.|$|E

5|$|During Danny Williams' time as premier the {{province}} experienced a major economic expansion, mainly {{as a result}} of the <b>offshore</b> <b>oil</b> industry.

While billions of dollars were paid down on the province's debt, government spending increased considerably. In his 2011 report Auditor General John Noseworthy noted that spending had increased by 47.4 percent over a five-year period. Finance Minister Tom Marshall defended the spending practises by saying that the province had to play catchup after decades of deficits, and that the global recession forced all governments to hike spending to keep economies afloat.|$|E

40|$|This paper asks {{a simple}} question: Are occupations {{that are well}} diversified across sectors less volatile, and maybe less {{susceptible}} to external shocks? Most external shocks (e. g. manufacturing <b>offshoring,</b> <b>oil</b> shocks) impact the labor market along sectoral lines, i. e. they impact product and output markets, {{and as a consequence}} they affect employment in various occupations. Some shocks, however, such as services offshoring affect horizontals or occupations. We find that an occupation spread out across many industrial sectors is less volatile, both in terms of numbers employed and the average wage. A dummy variable for offshoreable occupations does not affect the results; however, geographically clustered occupations seem more “at-risk, ” after accounting for sectoral diver-sification...|$|R
