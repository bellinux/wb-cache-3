40|$|The Finnish Securities Markets {{are being}} {{harmonized}} to enable better, more reliable and timely settlement of securities. Omnibus accounts {{are a common}} practice in the European securities markets. Finland forbids the use of omnibus accounts from its domestic investors. There {{is a possibility that}} the <b>omnibus</b> <b>account</b> usage is allowed for Finnish investors in the future. This study aims to build a comprehensive image to Finnish investors and account operators in determining the costs and benefits that the <b>omnibus</b> <b>account</b> structure would have for them. This study uses qualitative research methods. A literature review provides the framework for this study. Different kinds of research articles, regulatory documents, studies performed by European organisations, and Finnish news reportages are used to analyse {{the costs and benefits of}} omnibus accounts. The viewpoint is strictly of account operators and investors, and different effects on them are contemplated. The results of the analysis show that there are a number of costs and benefits that investors and account operators must take into consideration regarding omnibus accounts. The costs are related to development of IT-systems so that participants are able to adapt to the new structure and operate according to its needs. Decrease in the holdings’ transparency is a disadvantage of the structure and needs to be assessed precisely to avoid some problems it might bring. Benefits are mostly related to the increased competition in the securities markets as well as to the possible cost reductions of securities settlement. The costs and benefits were analysed according to the study plan of this thesis and as a result, the significance and impact of omnibus accounts to Finnish investors and account operators depends on the competition level and the decisions that all market participants make when determining if the account structure is beneficial for their operations...|$|E

Capital Market of Bangladesh is passing tough times since December 2010 as high volatility is eroding the capital of Thousands of Investors that might turn into social instability. This fall is caused by many factors which was tried to identify and tried to link up between The Causal factors of market crash and regulatory failure. Primary issue related problems was faulty listing methods and IPO overpricing, few numbers of new listings, revaluating assets before company listing, high premium in issuance of right share/Repeat IPO etc. while secondary market related problems was stock splits and stock price manipulations through block trading, circular trading and insider trading. Investor’s greed and irrational behavior played a big rule to make the stock prices sky rocking as they were crazy to buy shares without judging the company fundamentals. Shares of the companies with closed operations and big accumulated losses were rising constantly due to investors high risk appetite that caused them to loss everything. Government had already taken many steps (including SEC reforms) to stabilize the market but failed as investors confidence is in the bottom level. Government and regulators should work together to identify the main speculators and should brought under proper trial to bring investors back to the market. Regulator should make reforms on Listing procedures and other faulty regulatory frameworks to ensure transparency and efficiency in the capital market and also should bring clear guidelines regarding Private Placements, Asset Revaluation, insider training, Dealing with <b>omnibus</b> <b>account</b> etc. Now a day’s SEC & DSE has taken many steps to correction the market.

50|$|Under the {{indirect}} holding system, securities are held through fungible <b>accounts</b> (<b>omnibus</b> <b>accounts).</b> Under such a system, {{there is no}} record of an individual investor's interest in respect of the securities {{at the level of the}} issuer's or intermediary's register, other than the intermediary with whom the investor has a direct relationship. Thus, if the investor, or a person such as a collateral taker asserting a claim against the investor's interest were to try to enforce that claim at any of these higher levels, the response would be that no record exists of any interest against which the claim could be pursued. This problem demonstrates that any attempt to apply the look-through approach under a fungible custody structure runs counter to the widespread conflict of laws principle that jurisdiction over proprietary aspects of dispositions of movable property should broadly be attributed to the jurisdiction where orders in respect of that property are capable of being enforced.|$|R
50|$|The {{committee}} provided {{their findings}} after three months, on 7 April. It identified {{an array of}} chicanery performed by some 60 influential individuals {{that resulted in the}} recent market crash. The committee interviewed all members of both the DSE and CSE, and consulted journalists and analysts before presenting their report. The committee found various irregularities, including the existence of <b>omnibus</b> <b>accounts,</b> that allowed some market players to make exorbitant profits {{at the expense of the}} retail investors. Among the 60 identified primarily included chairman of Beximco and the mastermind of the 1996 market crash Salman F Rahman, former DSE president Rakibur Rahman, SEC chairman Ziaul Khandaker, SEC member Mansur Alam and BNP politician Mosaddek Ali Falu. The report mentioned that pro-government business tycoons, including Salman and Rakibur, exerted influence within the SEC by influencing the appointment of its members. The report ended with recommendations to reform the SEC drastically and asked the government to publish the names of the influential players and to remain cognizant in countering their influences.|$|R

40|$|The European Securities Trading and Post-trading (Clearing and Settlement) Industries have {{recently}} experienced a vast movement of consolidation. This {{was encouraged by}} the European Commission, seeking to establish a single market for the trade of financialsecurities across the European Union, and {{reduce the cost of}} cross-border transactions. For the regulator, the issue as a whole hinges on the need to allow for the achievement of economies of scale, while avoiding the possibility that an upstream monopolistic position might thwart competition in the downstream market, i. e. banking activities or securities trading activities. After long discussions with the industry, the European Commission considered that {{there was no need for}} regulation, provided that platforms adopted and implemented a "Code of Conduct". The present article challenges this view by showing that such a "Code of Conduct" may not be enough. We consider a model where custodians are competing to provide both custody services and banking services to investors. There is only one Central Security Deposit (CSD) where all the net orders must be in the end settled. Custodians have <b>omnibus</b> <b>accounts</b> in the CSD, for which they pay a fixed fee, and must pay an additional fee for each transaction. The CSD is directly competing with other custodians for the provision of custody and banking services. A key assumption is that because of economies of scale it would be socially inefficient to let several CSDs compete for the provision of depository and settlement services for a given security. Different types of regulator may be considered, such as the European commission, or those in place in other industries (telecom, energy). While the former may only impose external constraints on actors such as non-discriminatory access pricing or forbidding of integration, the latter may resort to a combination of monitoring and incentive regulation in order to extract information and impose a cost-based regulation. ...|$|R
50|$|If Article 8 is {{set aside}} and the {{brokerage}} account is considered purely under principles of common law, {{there is a}} possibility of construing the collection of brokerage accounts in the intermediated custodial holding chain as a collection of directed agency nominee trusts. According to this legal theory, each securities position with respect to a particular class of securities which appears in the brokerage firm's <b>omnibus</b> securities <b>account</b> is a trust fund for the benefit of customers sharing participation in that position. To exactly what extent the operation of such a theory would be restricted by Article 8 and the Securities Investor Protection Act in future litigation is not obvious, and is perhaps irrelevant as a practical matter because of the level of detail in the legislation mentioned.|$|R
50|$|Pension plans, {{by their}} nature involve {{investment}} of {{funds for the}} benefit of plan participants. There are several arrangements through which these funds are held in custody and invested. Traditional pension plans and some older defined contribution plans have one <b>omnibus</b> brokerage <b>account</b> where plan trustees invest participant funds for their benefit. In this case the participants have no control over investment decisions. These accounts are typically held at traditional brokerage houses, such as Morgan Stanley or UBS. The more common arrangement in today's market, however, involves the use of an integrated platform that allows participants to access their account balances through a technology system and change their investment elections as they see fit. John Hancock Insurance and QED Financial Systems are just two examples of a long list of firms offering such services.|$|R

We argue that the block bootstrap is a simple, <b>omnibus</b> method of <b>accounting</b> for correlation in a regression model with correlated errors. ...|$|R
