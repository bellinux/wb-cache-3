50|$|Cotton {{became the}} major crop between 1875 and 1915, {{with the largest}} crop being in 1906. The {{industry}} was helped in 1879 when the Texas Central Railroad reached Dublin, and in 1889 when the Fort Worth and Rio Grande railroad was completed through Stephenville. This opened eastern markets for the county's cotton crops. By 1910, soil erosion and the boll weevil caused diversity planning that led to dairy farms, fruit <b>orchards,</b> <b>nurseries,</b> peanuts, feed crops and poultry.|$|R
50|$|The {{garden was}} created circa 2001, and now {{contains}} some 2,500 perennials, shrubs, and trees, {{with a focus}} on aromatic plants, including 60 types of salvia and 30 types of mint. The garden is organized into a number of small areas: an exotic garden, garden of colors, vegetable garden, rose garden, moon garden, medieval garden, <b>orchard,</b> <b>nursery,</b> and vineyard. It also contains a collection of conifers and grasses, as well as an aviary of birds from Australia, Asia, and South America.|$|E
50|$|In 1866, he {{purchased}} from Mr. Lent {{a very beautiful}} country home, occupying eighty-eight acres {{on the west side}} of Santa Clara, California naming the place “New Park,” after the country home of his grandfather in England. The price paid Mr. Lent was $48,500, a very large sum for those days. It abutted on Franklin Street and included what is now the country home of R.T. Pierce. Pierce had the property managed for a period of this time by Harry Pickstone an Englishman who later migrated to South Africa where he engaged at Boschendal in the fruit business with Cecil Rhodes. It also included New Park House a fruit <b>orchard</b> <b>nursery,</b> a winery, servants quarters, pasture and stables. Upon his death this property was sold to Judge Hiram Bond who continued to operate it. After Judge Bond's death the property was sold to Senator James D. Phelan who constructed a Discalced Carmelite Nunnery which is still there as of 2009. While they were living there the Bonds hosted the author Jack London who had been their tenant handyman during much of the Klondike Gold Rush used the estate as the opening scene of the novel The Call of the Wild.|$|E

It is also effective against aphids, worms, ants, gnats, moths, beetles, earwigs, grasshoppers, mites, midges, spiders, ticks, yellow jackets, maggots, thrips, caterpillars, flies, fleas, and termites. It is mostly used in <b>orchards,</b> <b>nurseries,</b> and homes. In the agricultural sector, it is used in great amounts on certain crops, such as corn. About 70% of all hops and raspberries cultured in the United States are treated with bifenthrin.|$|R

40|$|As in many states, {{wildlife}} {{managers and}} biologists in the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Bureau of Wildlife (BOW) set white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) population objectives in deer management units (DMUs). BOW has {{authority to regulate}} deer harvest through a deer management permit quota system. Decisions about regulating deer population levels have {{a direct impact on}} stakeholders concerned with the degree of damage to field and vegetable crops, <b>orchards,</b> <b>nurseries,</b> tree plantations, gardens, and ornamental shrubbery. Deer densities also affect economic and recreational benefits derived by other stakeholders. Developing management strategies that address these conflicting interests is a challenge. In 1990, BOW biologists and Cornell Cooperative Extension (CCE) agents developed, organized, and implemented 15 DMU Citizen Task Forces (CTFs) throughout New York State. CTF members reflected a variety of stakeholder interests (e. g., agriculturalists, sportsmen, rural nonfarm landowners, foresters, Christmas tree growers, taxidermists, motorists, environmentalists, legislators). CCE agents facilitated the meetings, and BOW provided technical information concerning deer and deer management...|$|R

25|$|Alongside long {{standing}} <b>orchards,</b> <b>nurseries</b> and market gardens were increasing in number.

A sign of progress and modernity was the installation of a public drinking water fountain {{in the middle of}} the road at Mobbs Hill in 1911 and removed in 1929 as it had become a hazard to the increased volume of motorised traffic. A Mechanics' Institute and Memorial Hall, designed by Sydney architect and Carlingford resident Lord Livingstone Ramsay, was opened at Mobbs Hill in 1924 (demolished 1987) and was the centre of many social events, political rallies, fetes and school activities.|$|R
25|$|As more {{settlers}} {{arrived and}} cleared the land, cash crops replaced subsistence farming.

40|$|While this {{publication}} {{has as its}} primary purpose the presentation of data as a progress report on the apricot variety testing work of the Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, study of the apricot varieties being grown {{in the state and}} of the literature showed such a confusion of varietal nomenclature in <b>orchards,</b> <b>nurseries,</b> and even in the literature on apricot varieties, that it was considered desirable to review the literature and to describe the varieties at hand more completely than is usual with a report of this kind in the hope that by so doing the apricot variety situation might be clarified. It is hoped, also, that other workers interested in apricot variety studies will be assisted in correctly identifying varieties grown in their territory. As a result of this study, the conclusion was reached that not a single important apricot variety in Utah was being grown under its original or true name as described in the literature on apricot varieties. This study includes only the following classes of varieties: (1) Varieties grown in the test orchards; (2) varieties found growing in Utah; (3) varieties which may be grown in Utah under local names or incorrect names; and (4) those commended in the literature sufficiently to warrant their inclusion in later variety testing or breeding work. Since much of the literature is found in publications not generally available, it was thought worthwhile to compile and summarize it in available form in {{this publication}}.
