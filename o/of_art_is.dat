Bundaberg School <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> and Maryborough School <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>were</b> {{the only other}} centres with comparable buildings. As Rockhampton was proposed to be {{the capital of the}} new state of Central Queensland, its new School <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> would have to reflect the aspirations of its citizens. At a cost of £5,578 the Rockhampton School <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> building would <b>be</b> the most expensive in the colony.|$|R
5|$|The South Bend Museum <b>of</b> <b>Art</b> <b>is</b> {{located in}} Century Center in {{downtown}} South Bend.

A School <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> Reserve <b>was</b> proclaimed in 1895 and a new building was constructed but was also razed by fire on 25 April 1923. A special meeting of the School <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> Committee <b>was</b> held in the Commonwealth Bank on 26 April 1923 to discuss the erection of another building. The library of the School <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>was</b> re-opened in St Mary's Institute which was leased by the School <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> Committee, with books imported from London by the Mount Morgan Mine Manager, Adam Alexander Boyd.|$|R

5|$|Artist Matthew Ritchie was {{commissioned}} to create {{much of the}} building's artwork. One piece is a metal sculpture located on the exterior in the courtyard that mimics the nearby Willamette River's watershed, and includes metal spheres attached to the line shaped metal. The other main piece <b>of</b> <b>art</b> <b>is</b> a piece with two lightboxes on the interior that display different images as one moves along the display that uses lenticular glass. Images represent themes {{of the river and}} of legal history.|$|E
5|$|Inside, {{the main}} room is a conference room {{on the main floor}} that {{includes}} a large projection system {{that can be used for}} remote feeds, such as from the state capitol across the street. A painting by John Fery is displayed over the fireplace, which the fireplace was part of the original structure in the conference room. The remainder of the interior of the building has a modern look with glass-enclosed offices surrounding an open common area. Artwork owned by the university's Hallie Ford Museum <b>of</b> <b>Art</b> <b>is</b> displayed in this area. The main floor of the three-story building is the second floor, which rests atop the look-out basement. A small meeting room is located above a small portion of the main floor.|$|E

50|$|The Măgura {{sculpture}} {{camp was}} {{an event that}} {{took place during the}} summers of the years 1970-1986, when students and graduates of the Bucharest Academy <b>of</b> <b>Art</b> <b>were</b> training in sculpture. Their works <b>of</b> <b>art</b> <b>are</b> now visible on the meadows in front of the monastery, making up a large open-air art museum.|$|R
50|$|New type <b>of</b> <b>arts</b> <b>was</b> {{forming in}} Azerbaijan after {{establishment}} of the Soviet regime in Azerbaijan, in 1920. The first art school where new genres <b>of</b> visual <b>arts</b> <b>were</b> created, was opened in 1920, in Baku.|$|R
50|$|Abhinav College <b>of</b> <b>arts</b> <b>is</b> an {{important}} educational institute in Pashan.|$|R
5|$|The {{ability to}} study prehistoric art is {{dependent}} on surviving artifacts. Art created in mediums such as sand, bark, hides and textiles has not normally endured, while less-perishable materials, such as rock, stone, bone, ivory (and {{to a lesser extent}} wood), later pottery and metal, {{are more likely to be}} extant. Whether all these artifacts can be defined as works <b>of</b> <b>art</b> <b>is</b> contested between scholars. Alexander Marshack argued that the earliest, non-representational incisions on rock mark the beginnings of human art. More cautiously, Paul Mellars suggests that the relative rarity of these works means they cannot be seen as integral to early human society and evidence of an artistic culture.|$|E
5|$|Tulsa is home {{to several}} internationally renowned museums. Located in the former villa of oil pioneer Waite Phillips in Midtown Tulsa, the Philbrook Museum <b>of</b> <b>Art</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} one of the top 50 fine art museums in the United States, and is one of only five to offer a combination of a historic home, formal gardens, and an art collection. The museum's expansive collection includes work by a diverse group of artists including Pablo Picasso, Andrew Wyeth, Giovanni Bellini, Domenico di Pace Beccafumi, Willem de Kooning, William Merritt Chase, Auguste Rodin and Georgia O'Keeffe. Philbrook also maintains a satellite campus in downtown Tulsa.|$|E
5|$|From {{around this}} time onwards, while Etty still held to his belief that the purpose <b>of</b> <b>art</b> <b>is</b> to {{illustrate}} moral lessons, he began to abandon the literary, religious and mythological themes which had dominated his work. He began to paint still lifes, beginning with Pheasant and Peach (likely to be the painting now called Dead Pheasant and Fruit); in the 1840s he exhibited six in total, and painted many more. Etty was the first English painter to paint significant still lifes, {{which at the time}} were thought by the English a primarily Netherlandish form. Also for the first time, he began to paint a significant number of landscape paintings. Etty still continued to paint history paintings, but while he continued to produce highly acclaimed reworkings of his previous pictures, those works on fresh topics were generally poorly received. Etty's decline in quality can possibly be attributed in part to London art dealers; from 1835 dealer Richard Colls had become increasingly close to Etty, and by 1844 had a near-monopoly on his work. As the importance of the landed gentry to the art market declined, the new purchasers of art were industrialists; generally lacking in a classical education and with little interest in Old Masters, they preferred to buy works by then-contemporary artists such as Etty, and relied on dealers to advise them.|$|E
