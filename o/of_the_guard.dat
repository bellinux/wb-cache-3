5|$|During the Saxon {{campaign}} of 1813, Walther continued command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guard</b> Cavalry, and {{was present at}} the Battle of Lützen and Battle of Dresden, as commander <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guard</b> cavalry. At the Second Battle of Kulm (17 September 1813), he commanded the Imperial Guard Cavalry including the dragoons, Grenadiers à Cheval, and 1st (Polish) and 2nd (Dutch) Lancers. At the Battle of Leipzig, he commanded the 3rd Division of the cavalry of the Imperial Guard: The total cavalry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guard</b> included 7,903men and 18guns. After refitting and resupply at Erfurt, where Napoleon had stashed a large depot of arms and ammunition, the French army continued to withdraw through western Germany, toward the Rhine.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the ferocity}} of the Russian defense, {{everyone}} was aware that {{such a move would}} cost the lives of thousands of Guardsmen, but it was thought that the presence of this prestigious unit would bolster the morale of the entire army for a final decisive push. A notable exception was Marshal Bessières, commander <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guard</b> cavalry, {{who was one of the}} very few senior generals to strongly advise against the intervention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guard.</b> As the general staff were discussing the matter, general Rapp, a senior aide-de-camp to the Emperor, was being brought from the field of battle, having been wounded in action.|$|E

Hogarth was well known for his satirical works, and <b>The</b> March <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guards</b> to Finchley has been said to have given full scope to this sense of satire; it was described by Hogarth himself as [...] "steeped in humour".|$|R
5|$|These men soon saw {{action on}} 27 January, at the Battle of Brienne. Here, two {{companies}} of horse artillery, under an officer called Marin, {{a veteran of}} the campaigns in Italy and Egypt and personal favourite of the Emperor, were almost completely destroyed, with their guns and commander captured by the enemy. Napoleon was extremely irritated about the failure of the heavy cavalry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guard</b> to protect these gunners. A further loss of cannon <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guard</b> artillery occurred at the Battle of La Rothière, a rare battlefield defeat for Napoleon. Here, a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guard</b> cavalry charged and was initially successful against enemy cavalry but, faced by steady ranks of the Russian and Prussian Guardsmen and with its flank threatened by enemy dragoons, it soon had to withdraw, leaving behind some of its cannon.|$|E

A hastily assembled honour guard formed to greet Brock's unexpected arrival. Alone on entering the fort, Brock ordered the sergeant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guard</b> to disarm and had him confined.|$|E

5|$|From late 1987, the British {{authorities}} {{were aware that}} the IRA was planning to detonate a bomb at the changing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guard</b> ceremony outside the governor's residence in the British Dependent Territory of Gibraltar.

5|$|In {{addition}} to working dress, {{the army has}} a number of parade uniforms for ceremonial and non-ceremonial occasions. The most-commonly-seen uniforms are No.1 Dress (full ceremonial, seen at formal occasions such as at the changing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guard</b> at Buckingham Palace) and No.2 Dress (Service Dress), a brown uniform worn for non-ceremonial parades.|$|E

50|$|The Ming dynasty gave Borjigin princes (descended from Genghis Khan's brothers) command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Taining <b>Guard,</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Three <b>Guards</b> {{established}} in 1389.

5|$|In {{composing}} the Savoy operas, Sullivan {{wrote the}} vocal {{lines of the}} musical numbers first, and these {{were given to the}} actors. He, or an assistant, improvised a piano accompaniment at the early rehearsals; he wrote the orchestrations later, after he had seen what Gilbert's stage business would be. He left the overtures until last and often delegated their composition, based on his outlines, to his assistants, often adding his suggestions or corrections. Those Sullivan wrote himself include Thespis, Iolanthe, Princess Ida, The Yeomen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guard,</b> The Gondoliers, The Grand Duke and probably Utopia Limited. Most of the overtures are structured as a potpourri of tunes from the operas in three sections: fast, slow and fast. Those for Iolanthe and The Yeomen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guard</b> are written in a modified sonata form. The overtures from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas remain popular, and there are many recordings of them. Sullivan invariably conducted the operas on their opening nights.|$|E
5|$|Initially Milhaud's reserve cavalry {{corps of}} cuirassiers and Lefebvre-Desnoëttes' light cavalry {{division}} of the Imperial Guard, some 4,800sabres, were committed.

5|$|The {{division}} {{remained a}} National Guard formation until its inactivation in 1968 {{as part of}} a downsizing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guard.</b> Several units were activated to replace the division and carry on its lineage.

5|$|About 1558, {{according}} to a date on a fireplace, Bess of Hardwick and her third husband, Sir John's son Sir William St Loe, added a north east wing with a parlour and chapel, which includes Tudor buttresses.

His official positions included Captain of the Yeomen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guard,</b> Chief Butler of England and Member of Parliament for Derbyshire. He died suddenly without male issue in 1564/5, which Mary S. Lovell suggests may have been {{as a result of}} poisoning by his younger brother.

5|$|After rejoining the Emperor at Champaubert, Nansouty {{took part}} to the Battle of Montmirail, where he was at first {{instructed}} to protect the artillery. He then joined in the attack <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guard</b> infantry on the farm of Ėpine-au-Bois, where he suddenly wheeled left with his men and fell upon unprepared enemy infantry, charging home, routing these troops and subsequently pursuing the fugitives. This combined attack <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guard</b> resulted in {{a great number of}} prisoners and captured enemy guns, with Nansouty receiving a light wound in the process. A part of his men then took {{part to the}} Battle of Château-Thierry, where the Emperor ordered the Guard cavalry to make a turning move against the enemy left, and where Nansouty's subordinates General Letort and Colonel Curély brilliantly broke several enemy squares. Then, on 14 February, Nansouty personally led a brilliant charge at the Battle of Vauchamps, where he supported Grouchy in a cavalry action that decided the battle. Charging Blücher's men from the front, Nansouty allowed Grouchy to magnificently fall behind the enemy columns, which they both then sabred and crushed, with the Guard cavalry subsequently participating in a highly successful pursuit. Enemy losses reached a staggering 9,000-10,000 casualties, with 25 cannons lost. The Emperor was radiant following this battle, but, by nightfall, his mood changed when he found out of the loss of some Guard horse artillerymen. These men had been captured during their march and it was reported that their capture resulted from General Guyot (one of Nansouty's subordinates) failing to provide an escort and a guide for them. In Nansouty's presence, a fuming Napoleon summoned Guyot and then chastised him for the repeated losses in cannon during the previous battles, as well as for various other shortcomings, such as failing to properly escort the Emperor. After an angry tirade, Napoleon promptly axed Guyot and announced to Nansouty that General Exelmans would replace Guyot at the helm of his Old Guard heavy cavalry. This episode apparently strained relations between Emperor Napoleon and General Nansouty.|$|E
