5|$|Richard Nixon: The Shaping of His Character was {{published}} in late 1981 and received reviews less enthusiastic than any of her earlier books. Writing in The New Republic, Godfrey Hodgson questioned both her psychoanalytic approach and her motives: “e {{are in danger of}} having the insights <b>of</b> <b>psychotherapy</b> used as a tool for character destruction, certainly for libel, potentially for revenge.” Sales of the book were disappointing, {{in part because of the}} reviews, in part because memoirs by Nixon associates such as Henry Kissinger, John Ehrlichman, and John Dean had recently flooded the market. Perhaps Brodie’s book was most influential in stimulating Oliver Stone to create his controversial 1995 movie Nixon.|$|E
5|$|To {{recover from}} her {{experience}} at Studley, Fortune began studying psychotherapy. Her initial interest {{was in the}} work of Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, though she later moved on to that of Carl Jung. She studied psychology and psychoanalysis under John Flügel at the University of London, before gaining employment at a psychological clinic in London's Brunswick Square, which was likely run {{under the jurisdiction of the}} London School of Medicine for Women. Working as a counsellor from 1914 until 1916, most of those she dealt with were coming to terms with sexual urges that were considered taboo in British society. Through her affiliation with the Society for the Study of Orthopsychics, she gave a series of lectures that were later published in 1922 as The Machinery of the Mind. While working at the clinic, she developed her interest in esotericism by attending lunchtime lectures organised by the Theosophical Society and reading some of the organisation's literature. With her interest in occultism increasing, Fortune became increasingly dissatisfied with the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>psychotherapy.</b>|$|E
5|$|While benzodiazepines {{may have}} {{short-term}} benefits for anxiety, sleep and agitation in some patients, long-term (i.e., greater than 2–4 weeks) use {{can result in}} a worsening of the very symptoms the medications are meant to treat. Potential explanations include exacerbating cognitive problems that are already common in anxiety disorders, causing or worsening depression and suicidality, disrupting sleep architecture by inhibiting deep stage sleep, withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms in between doses mimicking or exacerbating underlying anxiety or sleep disorders, inhibiting the benefits <b>of</b> <b>psychotherapy</b> by inhibiting memory consolidation and reducing fear extinction, and reducing coping with trauma/stress and increasing vulnerability to future stress. Anxiety, insomnia and irritability may be temporarily exacerbated during withdrawal, but psychiatric symptoms after discontinuation are usually less than even while taking benzodiazepines. Fortunately, for those with benzodiazepine-induced problems, functioning significantly improves within 1 year of discontinuation.|$|E

40|$|Previous meta-analyses <b>of</b> <b>psychotherapies</b> {{for child}} and {{adolescent}} depression were limited {{because of the small}} number of trials with direct comparisons between two treatments. A network meta-analysis, a novel approach that integrates direct and indirect evidence from randomized controlled studies, was undertaken to investigate the comparative efficacy and acceptability <b>of</b> <b>psychotherapies</b> for depression in children and adolescents. Systematic searches resulted in 52 studies (total N= 3805) <b>of</b> nine <b>psychotherapies</b> and four control conditions. We assessed the efficacy at post-treatment and at follow-up, as well as the acceptability (all-cause discontinuation) <b>of</b> <b>psychotherapies</b> and control conditions. At post-treatment, only interpersonal therapy (IPT) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) were significantly more effective than most control conditions (standardized mean differences, SMDs ranged from - 0. 47 to - 0. 96). Also, IPT and CBT were more beneficial than play therapy. Only psychodynamic therapy and play therapy were not significantly superior to waitlist. At follow-up, IPT and CBT were significantly more effective than most control conditions (SMDs ranged from - 0. 26 to - 1. 05), although only IPT retained this superiority at both short-term and long-term follow-up. In addition, IPT and CBT were more beneficial than problem-solving therapy. Waitlist was significantly inferior to other control conditions. With regard to acceptability, IPT and problem-solving therapy had significantly fewer all-cause discontinuations than cognitive therapy and CBT (ORs ranged from 0. 06 to 0. 33). These data suggest that IPT and CBT should be considered as the best available psychotherapies for depression in children and adolescents. However, several alternative psychotherapies are understudied in this age group. Waitlist may inflate the effect <b>of</b> <b>psychotherapies,</b> so that psychological placebo or treatment-as-usual may be preferable as a control condition in psychotherapy trials.

40|$|International audienceThere is {{a long-standing}} and very active debate {{regarding}} which psychotherapeutic intervention {{should be used}} in depressive disorders. However, the effects <b>of</b> <b>psychotherapies</b> may result majorly from non-specific factors rather than from specific factors related to the type of psychotherapeutic intervention. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on aggregated data to understand how the effects <b>of</b> different <b>psychotherapies</b> are impacted by non-specific factors. We included randomized controlled trials that assessed the efficacy of psychotherapeutic interventions in the treatment of adult depressive disorders. The primary outcome was the change in depression score from baseline to the latest follow-up visit (i. e. response). A meta-regression was performed to predict response according to the type of intervention and non-specific factors (e. g. number of treatment sessions, length of follow-up, therapeutic allegiance of the investigator). The main analysis included 214 study arms from 84 trials. The effects <b>of</b> <b>psychotherapies</b> compared to the waiting list control condition failed to remain significant after adjusting for non-specific factors. Response increased with the number of treatment sessions (β =  0. 03, 95 % CI [0. 01; 0. 04]) and the length of follow-up (β =  0. 01, 95 % CI [0. 00; 0. 02]). Response also improved in case of presumed therapeutic allegiances among investigators (β =  0. 29, 95 % CI [0. 07; 0. 52]). Response to psychotherapies seems to be closely related to non-specific effects. The development of a well-designed trial that controls for non-specific factors might help disentangle the effects <b>of</b> <b>psychotherapies...</b>|$|R
25|$|There has {{traditionally}} been skepticism about the psychological treatment of personality disorders, but several specific types <b>of</b> <b>psychotherapy</b> for BPD have developed in recent years. There is growing evidence for the role <b>of</b> <b>psychotherapy</b> {{in the treatment of}} people with BPD, with indications that both comprehensive and non-comprehensive psychotherapeutic interventions may have a beneficial effect. Supportive therapy alone may enhance self-esteem and mobilize the existing strengths of individuals with BPD. Specific psychotherapies may involve sessions over several months or, as is particularly common for personality disorders, several years. Psychotherapy can often be conducted either with individuals or with groups. Group therapy can aid the learning and practice of interpersonal skills and self-awareness by individuals with BPD, though drop-out rates may be problematic.|$|E
