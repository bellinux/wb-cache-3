Primitive mantle-normalized patterns of jadeite in the samples generally showed high large-ion lithophile element contents, high light rare earth element/heavy rare earth element ratios and positive anomalies of high field <b>strength</b> <b>elements.</b> The studied jadeitites have no signatures of the protolith texture or mineralogy. Shapes and distributions of minerals coupled with chemical zoning within grains suggest that the jadeitites were formed by direct precipitation of minerals from aqueous fluids or complete metasomatic modification of the precursor rocks by fluids. In either case, the geochemical characteristics of jadeite are highly affected by fluids enriched in both large-ion lithophile elements and high field <b>strength</b> <b>elements.</b> The specific fluids responsible {{for the formation of}} jadeitites are related to serpentinization by slab-derived fluids in subduction zones.

40|$|The {{influence}} of hurricane-ocean coupling on intensity and track of tropical cyclones (TCs) is investigated through idealized numerical experiments using a coupled hurricane-ocean model. The {{focus is placed}} on how air-sea interaction affects TC tracks and intensity. It is found that the symmetric sea surface temperature (SST) cooling is primarily responsible for the TC weakening in the coupled experiments because the induced asymmetric circulation associated with the asymmetric SST anomalies is weak and shallow. The track difference between the coupled and fixed SST experiments is generally small because of the competing processes. One {{is associated with the}} modified TC asymmetries. The asymmetric SST anomalies - weaken the surface fluxes in the rear and enhance the fluxes in the front. As a result, the enhanced diabatic heating is located on the southern side for a westward-moving TC, tending to shift the TC southward. The symmetric SST anomalies weakens the TC intensity and thus the dymmetrization process, leading to more prominent TC asymmetries. The other is associated with the weakening of the beta drift resulting from the weakening of the TC <b>outer</b> <b>strength.</b> In the coupled experiment, the weakening of the beta drift leads to a more northward shift. By adjusting the vortex <b>outer</b> <b>strength</b> of the initial vortices, the beta drift can vary while the effect of air-sea interaction changes little.

40|$|While the {{previous}} studies of the impacts of air–sea interaction on tropical cyclones (TCs) generally agree on significant reduction in intensity and little change in track, they did not further explore the relative roles of the weak symmetric and strong asymmetric sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies relative to the TC center. These issues are investigated numerically with a coupled hurricane–ocean model in this study. Despite the relatively small magnitude compared to the asymmetric component of the resulting cooling, the symmetric cooling plays a decisive role in weakening TC intensity. A likely {{reason is that the}} symmetric cooling directly reduces the TC intensity, while the asymmetric cooling affects the intensity through the resulting TC asymmetries, which are mainly confined to the lower boundary and much weaker than those resulting from large-scale environmental influences. The differences in TC tracks between the coupled and fixed SST experiments are generally small because of the competing processes associated with the changes in TC asymmetries and the beta drift induced by air–sea interaction. The symmetric component of the SST drop weakens the TC intensity and <b>outer</b> <b>strength,</b> leading to a more northward beta drift. On the other hand, since the asymmetric component of the SST cooling is negative in the rear and positive in the front of a TC in the coupled experiments, the enhanced diabatic heating is on the southern side of a westward-moving TC, tending to shift the TC southward. In the coupled model the westward TCs with relatively weak (strong) <b>outer</b> <b>strength</b> tend to turn to the north (south) of the corresponding TCs without air–sea interaction. 1...|$|R

The ophiolitic bodies are (1) Refahiye (Erzincan), (2) Şahvelet (Erzurum), (3) Karadag ̆ (Erzurum) and (4) Kırdag ̆ (Erzurum). The ophiolite-related units include well-preserved sections of oceanic lithospheric and accretionary melanges with local blueschist assemblages. The ophiolite-related units in NE Anatolia are unconformably overlain by Campanian–Maastrichtian-aged sediments that were later imbricated with the ophiolitic rocks. Geochemical {{data for the}} individual ophiolite sections indicate a tholeiitic composition, depletion in Nb, enrichment in large ion lithophile elements, parallel to slightly depleted high field <b>strength</b> <b>element</b> patterns (compared with normal-mid ocean ridge basalt), and slightly light rare earth element-depleted to parallel rare earth element trends. These features suggest pro-gressive source depletion towards island arc tholeiites and finally boninites. A fore-arc setting is proposed for the generation of the ophiolites. In contrast, the volcanic rocks from the mélange units exhibit tholeiitic to alkaline compositions and either depletion or enrichment of rare earth element and high field <b>strength</b> <b>elements.</b> Seamount-type alkaline and subduction-related tholeiitic basaltic rocks were apparently juxtaposed during subduction/accretion.

40|$|AbstractThe {{solubility}} of rutile in H 2 O (±NaCl, albite) -fluids {{was measured}} by direct observation of dissolving mineral grains within the hydrothermal diamond anvil cell. This new approach for studying mineral solubilities at high p/T has the advantage that the sample eventually gets completely dissolved and can be visually observed during this process, which eliminates the risk of overestimating true solubilities due to dissolution and reprecipitation during the run. Our measured rutile solubilities in pure H 2 O are up to 1000 times lower than those reported in previous studies, ranging from 8 ppm to 26 ppm at 850 – 1000 °C/ 1. 2 – 2. 3 GPa. Nonlinear least square fitting of the data set resulted in the following equation for rutile solubility in pure water:cTiO 2,fluid=A·exp(−Δ⁢H°R⁢T) ·exp(−Δ⁢V°R⁢T·(p− 1 bar)),where A= 8728. 7 ppm, ΔH°= 74, 671 J·mol− 1, ΔV°=− 0. 61275 J·mol− 1 K− 1, and p, T are given in bar and Kelvin, respectively. The presence of 9 wt. % dissolved albite leads {{to an increase in}} the TiO 2 -solubility by a factor of 10, whereas addition of 15 wt. % NaCl results in a 2 – 3 times higher solubility than in pure water. Our results suggest that the solubility of TiO 2 (and, by inference, high field <b>strength</b> <b>elements</b> in general) in common mantle or subduction zone fluids is very low. In particular, the solubility of TiO 2 in these fluids is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than the solubility of TiO 2 in clinopyroxene, implying a fluid/clinopyroxene partition coefficient of Ti in the order of 10 − 2 to 10 − 3.
