5|$|Social {{anthropology}} is {{the branch}} of anthropology that studies how contemporary living human beings behave in social groups. Practitioners of social anthropology, like sociologists, investigate various facets <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>organization.</b> Traditionally, social anthropologists analysed non-industrial and non-Western societies, whereas sociologists focused on industrialized societies in the Western world. In recent years, however, social anthropology has expanded its focus to modern Western societies, meaning that the two disciplines increasingly converge.|$|E

30|$|First of all, {{the issues}} of {{organizational}} independence and capacity building are core ingredients in the partnership theory, {{but they are not}} existing in China mainland. The relationship between state and society in China is obscure. In China’s history, the relationship between the “state” and “society” has been in a subtle equilibrium, that is, the boundary of both parts is not absolute, but related in essence (Yang 1998). There has never been a national civil society (Deng 2005). The long-term integration of government administration with commune management (zheng she he yi, 政社合一) made the state-society relationship unclear. “Regulations on the registration and administration <b>of</b> <b>social</b> organizations” in 1998 required that <b>social</b> <b>organizations</b> be supervised by a service master unit (ye wu zhu guan dan wei, 业务主管单位) and register in a registration authority (deng ji dan wei, 登记单位). This dual supervision led to the weak development <b>of</b> the <b>social</b> <b>organization,</b> unclear responsibilities and the messy development <b>of</b> the <b>social</b> <b>organizations,</b> etc. The system of differential controls <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>organizations</b> reflects the blending of the boundaries of the government and <b>social</b> <b>organizations</b> (Wang and Liu 2007). The development <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>organizations</b> is leading to a complex and diverse combination of “independence” and “autonomy,” generalized as “dependent autonomy” (Wang and Song 2013). The premises of partnership theory (the independence and the growth of the nonprofit sectors) do not exist in China.|$|R

Many of B. petiolata characteristics are very similar to those of B. grisea.

25|$|Unger’s {{critique}} of Marginalism begins with Walras’ equilibrium theory, which attempted {{to achieve a}} certainty of economic analysis by putting aside normative controversies <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>organization.</b> Unger finds three weaknesses that crippled the theory: foremost, the theory claimed that equilibrium would be spontaneously generated in a market economy. In reality, a self-adjusting equilibrium fails to occur. Second, the theory puts forth a determinate image of the market. Historically, however, the market {{has been shown to}} be indeterminate with different market arrangements. Third, the polemical use of efficiency fails to account for the differences of distribution among individuals, classes, and generations.|$|E

25|$|Rivers {{had already}} formed {{a career in}} {{physiology}} and psychology. But now he moved more definitively into anthropology. He wanted a demographically small, fairly isolated people, comparable to the island societies of the Torres Strait, where {{he might be able}} to get genealogical data on each and every individual. The Todas in the Nilgiri Hills of Southern India, with their population then about 700 plus, suited Rivers’s criteria. And they had speciﬁc features <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>organization,</b> such as polyandrous marriage and a bifurcation of their society into so-called moieties that had interested historical evolutionists. Whether his fieldwork was initially so single-minded is questionable, however, since at first he looked at other local communities and studied their visual perception before fixing all his attention on the Todas.|$|E
25|$|After the Hohokam disappeared, Spanish explorers of the 16th century {{noted the}} use of canal {{irrigation}} in only two areas of the Southwest: eastern Sonora, primarily practiced by the Opata and Lower Pima, and among the Pueblos of northern New Mexico. Irrigation by the Opata and Pueblos had different objectives. In Sonora, with a long growing season, two crops of maize a year were grown in river valleys. The spring crop {{during the dry season}} was dependent upon irrigation; the summer and fall crop during the rainy season utilized irrigation to supplement rainfall. The necessity of irrigation probably required a high level <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>organization.</b> In New Mexico, with only one crop of maize per year possible, irrigation was supplemental and the lesser dependence on irrigation implies less social organization than in Sonora.|$|E

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>Organizations</b> are {{increasingly}} led {{to enter into}} competition with For-Profit Organizations, notably {{by the emergence of}} quasi-markets which are generally composed of low-skilled workers.

This article uses the economic literature in order to compare <b>social</b> and for-profit <b>organization</b> about the employment integration of their low-skilled workers. This literature review has highlighted the specificities <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>organizations</b> which may influence employment integration. First, it is showed that the social values sustained by the mission <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>organizations</b> could be a source of intrinsic motivation that may imply a higher satisfaction at work and lower wages. Secondly, the organizational structure implemented by <b>social</b> <b>organizations</b> should be slightly different since these structures have to be adapted to the mission of the organization and workers motivations...|$|R

25|$|The {{theory of}} false {{necessity}} attempts to understand humans and human history without making ourselves {{the object of}} a law-giving fate. It rejects the assumption that certain and necessary laws of organization and change govern the social, political, and economic institutions of human activity and thereby limit human freedom. It holds that the problem with traditional deep structure theory, such as Marxism, is that it couples the distinction of deep structure and routine practice with both indivisible types <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>organization,</b> and deep seated constraints and developmental laws. The theory rejects the constraints and focuses on how human behavior is shaped by the deep structures of these institutions, and how they can be remade at will, either in whole or in part. The aim is to rescue social theory and recreate the project of self-affirmation and society.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of prisons}} {{can be traced}} back to the rise of the state as a form <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>organization.</b> Corresponding with the advent of the state was the {{development}} of written language, which enabled the creation of formalized legal codes as official guidelines for society. The best known of these early legal codes is the Code of Hammurabi, written in Babylon around 1750 BC. The penalties for violations of the laws in Hammurabi's Code were almost exclusively centered on the concept of lex talionis ("the law of retaliation"), whereby people were punished as a form of vengeance, often by the victims themselves. This notion of punishment as vengeance or retaliation can also be found in many other legal codes from early civilizations, including the ancient Sumerian codes, the Indian Manama Dharma Astra, the Hermes Trismegistus of Egypt, and the Israelite Mosaic Law.|$|E
25|$|The Yup'ik kinship {{is based}} on what is {{formally}} classified in academia as an Eskimo kinship or lineal kinship. This kinship system is bilateral and a basic social unit consisted of from two to four generations, including parents, offspring, and parents' parents. Kinship terminologies in the Yup'ik societies exhibit a Yuman type <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>organization</b> with bilateral descent, and Iroquois cousin terminology. Bilateral descent provides each individual {{with his or her}} own unique set of relatives or kindred: some consanguineal members from the father's kin group and some from the mother's, with all four grandparents affiliated equally to the individual. Parallel cousins are referenced by the same terms as siblings, and cross cousins are differentiated. Marriages were arranged by parents. Yup'ik societies (regional or socioterritorial groups) were shown to have a band organization characterized by extensive bilaterally structured kinship with multifamily groups aggregating annually.|$|E
