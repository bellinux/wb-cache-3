60|$|In {{all this}} Phil was greatly {{assisted}} by his sister May, who, although {{not much more}} highly educated than himself, was quick of perception, of an inquiring mind, and a sympathetic soul. He was also somewhat assisted, and, at times, not a little retarded, by his ardent admirer Peter Pax, who joined him enthusiastically in his studies, but, being of a discursive and enterprising spirit, was prone to tempt him <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> <b>paths</b> of learning into the thickets of speculative philosophy.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the many}} {{activities}} that can be enjoyed during the summer in Nancy Lake Recreational Area is fishing. Big and Little Noluck lakes are stocked with rainbow trout fry by the Department of Fish and Game. These lakes produce good catches of up to 14-inch fish. Many lakes and ponds in the Lynx Lake Loop have populations of northern pike. You can also fish in the smaller ponds and lakes not directly on the trails, and you can explore <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> <b>paths</b> and find some great fishing. Such as the Lynx Lake Loop canoe an attraction that the area is well known for, the trail travels through an eight-mile chain of lakes. Other activities involve hiking and camping. Winter activities include ice fishing, skiing and dog musshing.|$|R
5000|$|Right next to {{the market}} grounds and the SG Bell {{sporting}} ground lies the small Freizeitpark Bell (“leisure park”), established in the 1970s. The principle of the small complex {{is that it was}} built “around nature”. Highlights here are the fairytale forest with moving figures, a petting zoo and simpler attractions. The park itself {{has its roots in the}} time when many German leisure parks were being established, and began, like others, with the fairytale forest. Although it is <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> tourist <b>path,</b> <b>the</b> park has economic importance for the local area.|$|R

25|$|The game {{consists}} of multiple chapters, each consisting of several verses. Depending {{on how well}} the player performs, they are given {{one of the following}} medals {{at the end of the}} verse; Stone, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum and Pure Platinum, similar to the rating system of Viewtiful Joe. There are some medals that are earned <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> <b>path,</b> such as special areas with set challenges. At the end of the chapter, a final score and an award is given depending on the type of medals achieved, with the score being deducted for any items used and deaths occurred. In between chapters there is a minigame called Angel Attack, in which players use Arcade Bullets found in the main levels to shoot at angels and earn points. These points can be traded in for items, with any leftover points exchanged for halos.|$|E

However, as his trip progressed, his mood improved, and he became comfortable on the road. Bashō met many friends and grew to enjoy the changing scenery and the seasons. His poems took on a less introspective and more striking tone as he observed the world around him: ...|$|E
50|$|Several saimin establishments {{including}} saimin noodle {{factories and}} restaurants have become local landmarks in Hawaii and have attracted out-of-state visitors who have ventured <b>off</b> <b>the</b> traditional tourist <b>beaten</b> <b>paths.</b> Many of these establishments have been officially {{designated by the}} State of Hawaii as places of historic interest. Among such establishments are Likelike Drive Inn and Washington Saimin on Oahu, and Hamura's Saimin on Kauai, which was given the James Beard Foundation's America's Classic honor in 2006.|$|R
50|$|Kallikratis is {{situated}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> tourist <b>path</b> and {{is made up}} of four widely separated neighborhoods that are scattered on a small plateau in Lefka Ori with an average altitude of 540m. It can be reached via Myriokefala, Asi Gonia or Asfendos, or via a recently paved road with more than 25 tight hair-pin turns, which starts in Kapsodasos and offers stunning views of the Frangokastello plain and the Libyan Sea in the distance. Kallikratis is also on the E4 walking route. Kallikratiano (i.e. Kallikratis') gorge starts southwest of the village and ends in the village of Patsianos, maintaining important natural habitats. The gorge can be crossed on a 4 km path. Before 1900, Kallikratis was a large village with more than 130 families. Today, only a few tens of inhabitants still live in the village and many of the houses are deserted. Kallikratis is uninhabited during the colder months of the year, since in that time the local shepherds move with their herds in transhumance to the warmer climate of the villages near the shore.|$|R
60|$|Let us {{consider}} {{the lot of}} these men. Any who have entered on even a secular crusade, something that takes them <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaten,</b> official <b>paths,</b> that leads them through the thorns and wildernesses of a new, untravelled country, towards some distant goal seen dimly, or not seen at all except in dreams, will know what such an undertaking means. It means snakes in the grass; it means savages, or in other words veiled and poisonous hatreds and bitter foes, or, still worse, treacherous friends. The crusader may get through, in which case no one will thank him except, perhaps, after he is dead. Or he may fail and perish, in which case every one will mock at him. Or he may retreat discouraged {{and return to the}} official road, in which case his friends will remark that they are glad to see that his insanity was only of the intermittent order, and that at length he has learned his place in the world and to whom he ought to touch his cap.|$|R

5000|$|The industrialization, {{urbanization}} and unsustainable agriculture {{practices of}} human society {{are considered to}} be having a serious impact on the environment. Ecotourism is now also considered to be playing a role in environmental depletion. While the term ecotourism may sound relatively benign, one of its most serious impacts is its consumption of virgin territories. These invasions often include deforestation, disruption of ecological life systems and various forms of pollution, all of which contribute to environmental degradation. For example, the number of motor vehicles crossing a park increases as tour drivers search for rare species. The number of roads disrupts the grass cover, which has serious consequences on plant and animal species. These areas also have a higher rate of disturbances and invasive species due to increasing traffic <b>off</b> of <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> <b>path</b> into new, undiscovered areas. Ecotourism also has an effect on species through the value placed on them. [...] "Certain species have gone from being little known or valued by local people to being highly valued commodities. The commodification of plants may erase their social value and lead to overproduction within protected areas. Local people and their images can also be turned into commodities". Camaro brings up a relatively obvious contradiction, any commercial venture into unspoiled, pristine land with or without the [...] "eco" [...] prefix as a contradiction in terms. To generate revenue {{you have to have a}} high number of traffic, tourists, which inevitably means a higher pressure on the environment.|$|R
6000|$|... "You speak like a giddy child," [...] said Le Balafre, [...] "and {{even as a}} child, you harp {{over the}} same notes on a new string. Look you: if the King employs Oliver Dain, his barber, to do what Oliver {{can do better than}} any peer of them all, is not the kingdom the gainer? If he bids his stout Provost Marshal, Tristan, arrest such or such a seditious burgher, take off such or such a {{turbulent}} noble, the deed is done, and no more of it; when, were the commission given to a duke or peer of France, he might perchance send the King back a defiance in exchange. If, again, the King pleases to give to plain Ludovic le Balafre a commission which he will execute, instead of employing the High Constable, who would perhaps betray it, doth it not show wisdom? Above all, doth not a monarch of such conditions best suit cavaliers of fortune, who must go where their services are most highly prized, and most frequently in demand?--No, no, child, I tell thee Louis knows how to choose his confidants, and what to charge them with; suiting, as they say, the burden to each man's back. He is not like the King of Castile, who choked with thirst, because the great butler was not beside to hand his cup.--But hark to the bell of St. Martin's! I must hasten, back to the Castle--Farewell--make much of yourself, and at eight tomorrow morning present yourself before the drawbridge, and ask the sentinel for me. Take heed you step not <b>off</b> <b>the</b> straight and <b>beaten</b> <b>path</b> in approaching <b>the</b> portal! There are such traps and snap haunches as may cost you a limb, which you will sorely miss. You shall see the King, and learn to judge him for yourself--farewell." ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the past}} decade, tourism has increased, in {{particular}} concerning internal and European arrivals.

Abruzzo's wealth of castles and medieval towns, especially around the town of L'Aquila, has earned it in some quarters the nickname of [...] "Abruzzoshire", by analogy with the [...] "Chiantishire", nickname sometimes used to refer to the Chianti area of Tuscany, but Abruzzo is still <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> <b>path</b> for most visitors to Italy.|$|E
