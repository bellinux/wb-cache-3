5|$|Brian and Stewie {{manage to}} sneak in {{backstage}} at the concert, where Miley asks why they're here. Brian then explains that Stewie has a 'tumor' shaped like a football, which convinces Miley to let them hang out with her backstage. Miley and Stewie quickly become best friends and they sing a song which Stewie wrote. Soon, Chris realizes that the Monkey has {{spent more time with}} him, like taking him to play baseball and going to a father and son BBQ in Monkeykid. Chris then says to Peter that he has never gave as much attention to him as the monkey has, so he grows to resent his own father. While having ice-cream with Miley, Stewie notices a signal interference <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>cell</b> phone when handing it to her. He then realises something is strange about Miley. Upon spying on her, Stewie and Brian discover that she is actually an android after seeing an employee insert a USB drive on the control panel on Miley's back. They both realized that Miley was created by Walt Disney Imagineering to become the perfect teen idol that can never fail. When Brian curiously asks if she can perform other tasks, Stewie agrees to reprogram Miley to have sex with Brian by gaining access to the control panel. However, it goes wrong and he accidentally sends Miley into a rage, forcing Stewie and Brian to run away from the monstrous Miley.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and {{her mother}} visit her brother Bill and his {{pregnant}} wife Tara around Christmas time. Scully answers the phone, and {{the person on the}} other line, who sounds just like her dead sister Melissa, tells her that someone needs her help. Scully traces the call to a nearby home in San Diego where a group of cops are investigating the suicide of a woman, Roberta Sim. The lead detective, Kresge, tells Scully that it was impossible for Roberta to have dialed, as she died before the telephone call was made. That night after dinner Scully reveals to her mother that due to her abduction and cancer she is unable to bear children. Scully flashes back to when as a child, she hid her pet rabbit from her brother in a lunchbox, only for it to suffocate and die. Scully receives another telephone call from the same person <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>cell</b> phone, which was once again made from the Sim home. Roberta's husband, Marshall, is meeting with two dark-suited men inside his house and has no desire to listen to and help Scully figure out what is going on.|$|E

2500|$|Haley Elizabeth Reinhart {{was born}} in Wheeling, Illinois, on September 9, 1990, to Patti Miller-Reinhart and Harry Reinhart, {{both of whom are}} musicians and native Chicagoans from the north side and south side, respectively. She has one sister, Angela, who is five years younger than her. Angela is a singer-songwriter and musician, as well, and she {{primarily}} performs indie folk music. Reinhart is of German, Irish, and Italian descent. Around the age of three, her parents would hold her up on stage and have her sing the chorus or vocal harmonies for [...] "Brown Eyed Girl." [...] She began singing seriously when she was 7 or 8 years old, performing with her parents’ band, Midnight, which covers rock songs from the 1960s and 1970s. Reinhart's mother was also the lead singer for a band called The Company She Keeps before she joined Midnight in 1977. When she was nine years old, Reinhart sang LeAnn Rimes' 1996 arrangement of Bill Mack's 1958 classic, [...] "Blue", on a big stage at a tattoo convention, and she was met with [...] "overwhelming" [...] support from the audience. She has been writing poetry since she was eight years old and has competed in many poetry slam competitions throughout her life. She also has a passion for improv and has been active in plays, musicals, and skit performances since childhood. Reinhart began writing songs in Middle School, and she explains that [...] "when I give myself the time to sit down, and reflect, and feel, and let things come out, I find that it’s very easy for me to do." [...] She had several hundred compositions saved <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>cell</b> phone before it broke, losing all of the material.

50|$|This morning (Saturday) a {{few minutes}} after 8 o'clock, Elizabeth Martha BROWN, convicted of the wilful murder of her husband was {{executed}} on a scaffold erected over the gateway of the new entrance leading to Dorset County Goal from North Square. The culpret did not up to the last moment, appear to shed a tear. She <b>on</b> leaving <b>her</b> <b>cell,</b> shook hands with the chief warder and other officers. <b>On</b> <b>her</b> way to the scaffold her demeanour was extraordinary.

Her female attendants here left her in the care of the executioner.|$|R
40|$|Fc gamma RIIa {{is widely}} {{expressed}} on hematopoietic cells. There are two known allelic polymorphic forms of Fc gamma RIIa, Fc gamma RIIa-R- 131 and Fc gamma RIIa-H- 131, which {{differ in the}} amino acid at position 131 in the second Ig-like domain. In contrast to Fc gamma RIIa-R- 131, Fc gamma RIIa-H- 131 binds hIgG(2) but not mIgG(1), and this differential binding has clinical implications for host defense, autoimmune disease, immunohematologic disease, and response to therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. We identified a novel Fc gamma RIIA genotype in a healthy individual homozygous for Fc gamma RIIA R/R- 131 in whom a C to A substitution at codon 127 changes glutamine (Q) to lysine (K) {{in one of the}} two Fc gamma RIIA genes. This individual 2 ̆ 7 s homozygosity for Fc gamma RIIA-R/R- 131 leads to the prediction that the receptors <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>cells</b> would not bind hIgG(2). Monocyte and neutrophil phagocytosis of hIgG(2) -opsonized erythrocytes was significantly higher (P <. 05) for cells from this K/Q(127), R/R- 131 individual than for Q/Q(127), R/R- 131 donors. Platelet aggregation stimulated by an mIgG(1) anti-CD 9 antibody in this individual was significantly different (P <. 05) from Q/Q(127), H/R- 131 and Q/Q(127), H/H- 131 donors and similar to Q/Q(127), R/R- 131. Our data show that the K- 127 /R- 131 receptors have a unique phenotype binding both hIgG(2) and mIgG(1). Further functionally significant mutations in human Fc gamma receptors and possible novel mechanisms for inherited differences in disease susceptibility should be sought with unbiased screening methods.

40|$|Much {{information}} {{can be obtained from}} knowing what tasks the user does <b>on</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>cell</b> phone. This paper describes GuiDE, an automated user-activity recognition system on the mobile phone. GuiDE's unique approach to activity recognition exploits GUI screenshots taken as the individual interacts with their cell phone. These screenshots are aggregated into a graph to help probabilistically determine whether or not a set of screenshots can be considered a user-level activity. A frequency count of different sets of screenshots is also kept to act as a sanity check against the probabilistic result. GuiDE is just a partial step towards a much more powerful tool that can correlate GUI information with other services to provide a better understanding of user activity. by Emily Z. Yan. Thesis (M.
