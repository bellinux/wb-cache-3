5|$|After the 1988 season, the Brewers added Bates {{to their}} winter roster as the 1989 season approached. However, when 12-year Brewer second baseman Jim Gantner re-signed with the club, Bates was demoted to Denver, and the Journal-Sentinel {{predicted}} {{that he would}} remain there due to his limited defensive versatility. Bates began the season with the Zephyrs and in July {{was named to the}} Triple-A All-Star Game. On the MLB level, the Brewers suffered multiple injuries to starting players, having 9 athletes on the disabled list (DL) on August 22 and 14 total players <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>DL</b> up to that point. In a game against the New York Yankees on August 15, Gantner played at second base as the Brewers tried to hold on to a 1–0 lead. With Marcus Lawton on first base, Yankees batter Wayne Tolleson hit a ground ball to shortstop Bill Spiers for a potential double play. Lawton ran into Gantner, who had trouble fielding a low throw from Spiers; umpire Dave Phillips called both Lawton and Tolleson out due to Lawton's illegal roll-block, but Gantner tore the medial collateral ligament in his left knee and was placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>DL.</b> Bates was called up as his replacement.|$|E

After two games back, Bochy decided to shut down Wilson for the final two games of the season. In 57 games, he had a 6–4 record, a 3.11 ERA, 54 strikeouts, and 31 walks in 55 innings pitched. He converted 36 of his 41 save opportunities, which tied Juan Carlos Oviedo for eighth in the NL.|$|E

5|$|Lieber's 2002 {{season was}} curtailed by right elbow problems, which plagued him all year. On August 1, facing the San Diego Padres, Lieber allowed two runs in seven innings but {{received}} a no-decision in an 87 Cubs' victory. He was placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>DL</b> with right elbow tendinitis the next day, and he underwent Tommy John surgery on August 8, ending his season.
