5|$|The {{causes of}} the decline include the {{fragmentation}} and loss of open grasslands to scrub <b>or</b> <b>human</b> activities such as the construction of ski resorts, and a longer-term threat comes from global warming which would cause the species' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{forecasting}} of wind, precipitations {{and humidity}} {{is essential for}} preventing and controlling wildfires.

5|$|An enquiry {{into the}} crash was hastily set up. The commission's report (Aktenzeichen 52, Br.B.Nr. 270/42) {{concluded}} that the crash was caused by damage to the differential gear, which caused an oil leak. Then a number of teeth broke off the spur wheel and ignited the oil. Sabotage <b>or</b> <b>human</b> error was ruled out. The aircraft, W. Nr. 14256, was ferried to the unit via Bari, Italy.

5|$|Choughs can be locally {{threatened}} by the accumulation of pesticides and heavy metals in the mountain soils, heavy rain, shooting and other human disturbances, but a longer-term threat comes from global warming, which would cause the species' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely. Fossils of both chough species {{were found in the}} mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change <b>or</b> <b>human</b> activity.|$|E
5|$|From 1999–2001, Western {{media reports}} on Falun Gong—and in particular, the mistreatment of practitioners—were frequent, if mixed. By {{the latter half}} of 2001, however, the volume of media reports {{declined}} precipitously, and by 2002, coverage of Falun Gong by major news organizations like the New York Times and Washington Post had almost completely ceased, particularly from within China. In a study of media discourse on Falun Gong, researcher Leeshai Lemish found that Western news organizations also became less balanced, and more likely to uncritically present the narratives of the Communist Party, rather than those of Falun Gong <b>or</b> <b>human</b> rights groups.|$|E

5|$|Fu: Fu were Chinese tally sticks made of bamboo, wood, metal (gold, silver, bronze) or jade {{and used}} as a proof of authorization. Most commonly, fu were made of wood or bamboo in sizes of wooden slips or bamboo chopsticks. Although fu {{have been made in}} various shapes (such as tiger, dragon, turtle, snake, fish <b>or</b> <b>human),</b> most of them come {{in the shape of a}} tiger. Classical {{description}} of tallies is found in the Zhou li, which refers to the tallies of jade and horn, and mentions the shapes of tiger, human, dragon, seal, and banner.|$|E
5|$|In Spain, the red-billed chough has {{recently}} expanded its range by utilising old buildings, with 1,175 breeding pairs in a mi) study area. These new breeding areas usually surround the original montane core areas. However, the populations with nest sites on buildings {{are threatened by}} human disturbance, persecution {{and the loss of}} old buildings. Fossils of both chough species were found in the mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change <b>or</b> <b>human</b> activity.|$|E
5|$|It mostly breeds in acacia and {{tamarisk}} scrub {{and tall}} grass, invariably near rivers or other wetlands. The construction {{and expansion of}} irrigation canals has increased its habitat in Sindh, and helped it extend its range into the Yamuna floodplain and parts of Rajasthan, India. It may breed around rice paddies and other fields, <b>or</b> <b>human</b> habitations, provided that there is enough cover and suitable nesting sites. In winter, it moves away from its main riverine habitat, and into drier thickets characterised by Salvadora and Capparis bushes, but never moves too far from water.|$|E

5|$|Like {{all members}} of its family, the Pacific swift feeds {{exclusively}} on insects caught in flight. It tends to hunt higher than most of its relatives other than the white-throated needletail. The Pacific swift has a large population and extensive breeding area, and faces few threats from predators <b>or</b> <b>human</b> activities. It is classed as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It has occurred as far afield as the US and New Zealand, {{and it is a}} very rare vagrant in Europe, where it has been recorded in Denmark, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez {{was also}} a guest of human rights festival One world, {{organized}} by a non-profit humanitarian organization People In Need. A film by a Swiss director Barbara Miller Forbidden Voices: How to Start a Revolution with a Laptop was among the films shown during the festival. The film presents three women - one of them being Sánchez - who use blogs and social networks to spread information from their countries living under authoritarian regimes, thus fighting for women rights <b>or</b> <b>human</b> rights in general. Sánchez was also invited to a discussion at the Charles University about independent journalism in Cuba.|$|E
5|$|The Muisca, as the {{indigenous}} {{groups in the}} west of Colombia, developed a variety of textiles from fique or cotton. Cords were made of fique <b>or</b> <b>human</b> hair. The people of the cold climate Altiplano {{did not have a}} major cotton production, yet traded most of their cotton with their neighbours; the Muzo in the west, Panche in the southwest, Guane in the northwest, and the Guayupe in the east. From the raw cotton, the Muisca women made fine cotton mantles that were traded on the many markets in the Muisca territory.|$|E

The mascot of the Summer Olympics in London was named Wenlock after the town of Much Wenlock in Shropshire. Much Wenlock still hosts the Wenlock Olympian Games, which were an inspiration to Pierre de Coubertin for the Olympic Games.|$|E

5|$|The largest {{breeding}} {{populations are}} in Russia (up to 500,000pairs), Spain (112,000 pairs) and Belarus (60,000 pairs). There have been declines {{in much of}} the range, but especially in northwestern Europe. The loss of insect prey through pesticide use, coupled with disturbance, collision with vehicles and habitat loss have contributed to the falling population. As ground-nesting birds, they are adversely affected by disturbance, especially by domestic dogs, which may destroy the nest or advertise its presence to crows or predatory mammals. Breeding success is higher in areas with no public access; where access is permitted, and particularly where dog owners allow their pets to run loose, successful nests tend to be far from footpaths <b>or</b> <b>human</b> habitation.|$|E
