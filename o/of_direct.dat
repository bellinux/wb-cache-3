Twenty-seven states had called for a constitutional convention on the subject, with 31 states needed to reach the threshold; Arizona and New Mexico each achieved statehood that year (bringing the total number of states to 48), and were expected to support the motion. Alabama and Wyoming, already states, had passed resolutions in favor of a convention without formally calling for one.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of shellability <b>of</b> complexes <b>of</b> <b>directed</b> trees {{was asked by}} R. Stanley. D. Kozlov showed {{that the existence of}} a complete source in a directed graph provides a shelling of its complex <b>of</b> <b>directed</b> trees. We will show that this property gives a shelling that is straightforward in some sense. Among the simplicial polytopes, only the crosspolytopes allow such a shelling. Furthermore, we show that the complex <b>of</b> <b>directed</b> trees <b>of</b> a complete double directed graph is a union of suitable spheres. We also investigate shellability of the maximal pure skeleton of a complex <b>of</b> <b>directed</b> trees. Also, we prove that is vertex-decomposable. For these complexes we describe the set of generating facets. Comment: This is a new version in which Section 3 about complexes C_n^k is removed. There are some troubles in the proof of Theorem 14.
