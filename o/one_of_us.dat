5|$|From Russia, with Love {{received}} broadly positive reviews at {{the time}} of publication. The book's sales were boosted by an advertising campaign that played upon a visit by the British Prime Minister Anthony Eden to Fleming's Goldeneye estate, and the publication of an article in Life, which listed From Russia, with Love as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>US</b> President John F. Kennedy's ten favourite books. The story was serialised in the Daily Express newspaper, first in an abridged, multi-part form and then as a comic strip. In 1963 it was adapted into the second film in the Bond series, starring Sean Connery.|$|E
5|$|Pliny's {{purpose in}} writing the Natural History was to cover all {{learning}} and art so far as they are connected with nature or draw their materials from nature. He says:My subject is a barren one – the world of nature, or in other words life; and that subject in its least elevated department, and employing either rustic terms or foreign, nay barbarian words that actually have to be introduced with an apology. Moreover, the path is not a beaten highway of authorship, nor {{one in which the}} mind is eager to range: there is not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who has made the same venture, nor yet one among the Greeks who has tackled single-handed all departments of the subject.|$|E

25|$|In a very {{definite}} sense, {{we are all}} beneficiaries {{from the}} life of Fr. Kapaun. He has left us a stirring example of devotion to duty. He has passed on to us a spirit of tolerance and understanding. He has given us a share of dauntless bravery– of body and soul. He has transmitted to every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> a new appreciation of America, and a keener, more realistic understanding of our country's greatest enemy– godlessness, now stalking the world in the form of communism. He has bequeathed a picture of Christ-like life. What Fr. Kapaun willed to us cannot be contained in memorials, however costly or beautiful. It is a treasure for the human soul– the spirit of one who loved and served God and man– even unto death.|$|E
25|$|To you the IRA and all {{who support}} you or defend you, {{we have to}} say that we feel dirty today. Foul and dirty deeds by Irishmen are making Ireland a foul and dirty place, for it is things done by Irishmen that make us unclean. What the British could never do, what the Unionists could never do, you have done. You have made us bow our heads in shame and that is a dirty feeling. The IRA is like a cancer in the body of Ireland, {{spreading}} death, killing and corruption. It is the unrelenting enemy of life and the community is afraid because it cannot see or identify it. We want the cancer of the IRA removed from our midst but not by means that will leave the moral fibre of society damaged and the system unclean. Fighting evil by corrupt means kills pawns like Joe and leaves every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> vulnerable and afraid. And it allows Joe's killers to draw a sickening veneer of respectability over cold-blooded murder and to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate.|$|E

25|$|Now, praise be to God that Dr. Zamenhof has {{invented the}} Esperanto language. It {{has all the}} {{potential}} qualities of becoming the international means of communication. All of us must be grateful and thankful to him for this noble effort; for in this way he has served his fellowmen well. With untiring effort and self-sacrifice {{on the part of}} its devotees Esperanto will become universal. Therefore every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> must study this language and spread it as far as possible so that day by day it may receive a broader recognition, be accepted by all nations and governments of the world, and {{become a part of the}} curriculum in all the public schools. I hope that Esperanto will be adopted as the language of all the future international conferences and congresses, so that all people need acquire only two languages—one their own tongue and the other the international language. Then perfect union will be established between all the people of the world. Consider how difficult it is today to communicate with various nations. If one studies fifty languages one may yet travel through a country and not know the language. Therefore I hope that you will make the utmost effort, so that this language of Esperanto may be widely spread.|$|E
