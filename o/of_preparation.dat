5|$|August 7–9, 1993 - Tropical Storm Bret {{moves across}} {{northern}} Venezuela and Colombia. In Venezuela, the storm drops at least 13.35inches (339mm) in Guanare.

Of the 173 deaths caused by Bret in Venezuela, most occur in the low-income areas near Caracas. Lack <b>of</b> <b>preparation,</b> including weather forecasters prematurely stating the worst of the storm is over, is part of the problem. In all, 10,000 are left homeless, and damaged totals $25million (1993USD, $37million 2008USD). In Colombia, Bret causes one death and one injury.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the extreme}} {{difficulty}} of the competition, several stages <b>of</b> <b>preparation</b> are needed.

One week after the food drop, all dogs participating in the race undergo a preliminary veterinarian inspection to ensure they are healthy enough to race 1,000miles in subarctic conditions. The final stage of formal preparation is {{two days before the}} race, when mushers pick their starting order from a hat.|$|E
