40|$|In {{this paper}} the tunable M-channel filters based on Thue-Morse heterostructures {{consisting}} of single -negative materials has been studied. The {{results showed that}} the number of resonance modes inside the zero- gap increases as the number <b>of</b> <b>heterogenous</b> interface, M, increases. The number of resonance modes inside the zero- gap is equal to that <b>of</b> <b>heterogenous</b> interface M, and it can be used as M channels filter. This result provides a feasible method to adjust the channel number of multiple-channel filters. When losses are involved, the {{results showed that the}} electric fields of the resonance modes decay largely with the increase of the number <b>of</b> <b>heterogenous</b> interface and damping factors. Besides, the relationship between the quality factor of multiple-channel filters and the number <b>of</b> <b>heterogenous</b> interface M is linear, and the quality factor of multiple-channel filters decreases with the increase of the damping factor. These results provide feasible methods to adjust the quality factor of multiple-channel filter...|$|R

In particular, we present a framework, called Requirement-driven Contracting (RdC), for automatically deriving executable norms from requirements and associated relevant information. RdC facilitates the governance of MAS by ensuring that all requirements, along with runtime changes of requirements are appropriately and automatically reflected in the norms regulating the behavior of MAS. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{enforcing}} the state variables {{of a network}} <b>of</b> <b>heterogenous</b> dynamical systems {{to agree on a}} predefined function of the corresponding initial conditions (e. g., the average value) is a problematic challenge when perturbations affect agents' dynamics. When the linear consensus algorithms are used, such uncertainties shift the equilibrium of the network with respect to the expected nominal one. Thus motivated, in this paper we show how the integral sliding-mode control design paradigm can be usefully applied in the framework of multi-agent systems to solve the consensus-on-the-average problem for a network <b>of</b> <b>heterogenous</b> agents with perturbed integrator dynamics. Lyapunov analysis is developed to support the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm, and simulative results are discussed to corroborate the theoretical results...|$|R

The impact <b>of</b> <b>heterogenous</b> catalysts on the Wet Air Oxidation (WAO) of Linear Alkylbenzene Sulphonate (LAS) has been determined. Experiments were carried out at temperatures from 180 C to 220 C for 120 minutes, and an oxygen partial pressure of 1. 5 MPa was maintained for all the experiments. The catalyst was introduced to the original solution of LAS and all of the catalysts were used in a powder form.
