5|$|In 1923, John von Neumann {{developed}} an axiom system that eliminates the paradoxes {{by using an}} approach similar to Cantor's—namely, by identifying collections that are not sets and treating them differently. Von Neumann stated that a class is too big to be a set {{if it can be}} put into <b>one-to-one</b> <b>correspondence</b> <b>with</b> the class of all sets. He defined a set as a class that is a member of some class and stated the axiom: A class is not a set if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and the class of all sets. This axiom implies that these big classes are not sets, which eliminates the paradoxes since they cannot be members of any class. Von Neumann also used his axiom to prove the well-ordering theorem: Like Cantor, he assumed that the ordinals form a set. The resulting contradiction implies that the class of all ordinals is not a set. Then his axiom provides a one-to-one correspondence between this class and the class of all sets. This correspondence well-orders the class of all sets, which implies the well-ordering theorem. In 1930, Zermelo defined models of set theory that satisfy von Neumann's axiom.|$|E

As like Robinsonian dissimilarities induced by indexed pyramids generalize ultrametrics induced by indexed hierarchies we show that {{a new kind of}} dissimilarity called “Yadidean” induced by spatial pyramids generalize Robinsonian dissimilarities.

However, the verbal {{morphology}} is quite different: Cebuano has twenty-four verbal affixes which indicate grammatical aspect and other feature, whereas Eskayan has just five (muy-, dil-, pur-, yu-, yi-), each of which can substitute {{for any of the}} Cebuano affixes. This often makes Eskayan grammar ambiguous, and dependent on the parallel Cebuano text. In addition, some Eskayan verbs are equivalent to specific inflections of Cebuano verbs despite not having any morphology. For example, Eskayan imprus 'was taken on', which is basic root, translates Cebuano gipuslan, where gi- indicates that the action is completed and performed on the grammatical agent. This is likely because the prototype for many Eskayan words was an early English–Spanish–Visayan trilingual, with the Visayan (Cebuano) glosses crossed out and replaced with Eskayan.|$|E
25|$|In an {{infinite}} distributive lattice, {{it may not}} be the case that the lower sets of the join-irreducible elements are in <b>one-to-one</b> <b>correspondence</b> <b>with</b> lattice elements. Indeed, there may be no join-irreducibles at all. This happens, for instance, in the lattice of all natural numbers, ordered with the reverse of the usual divisibility ordering (so x≤y when y divides x): any number x can be expressed as the join of numbers xp and xq where p and q are distinct prime numbers. However, elements in infinite distributive lattices may still be represented as sets via Stone's representation theorem for distributive lattices, a form of Stone duality in which each lattice element corresponds to a compact open set in a certain topological space. This generalized representation theorem can be expressed as a category-theoretic duality between distributive lattices and spectral spaces (sometimes called coherent spaces, but not the same as the coherent spaces in linear logic), topological spaces in which the compact open sets are closed under intersection and form a base for the topology. Hilary Priestley showed that Stone's representation theorem could be interpreted as an extension of the idea of representing lattice elements by lower sets of a partial order, using Nachbin's idea of ordered topological spaces. Stone spaces with an additional partial order linked with the topology via Priestley separation axiom can also be used to represent bounded distributive lattices. Such spaces are known as Priestley spaces. Further, certain bitopological spaces, namely pairwise Stone spaces, generalize Stone's original approach by utilizing two topologies on a set to represent an abstract distributve lattice. Thus, Birkhoff's representation theorem extends to the case of infinite (bounded) distributive lattices in at least three different ways, summed up in duality theory for distributive lattices.|$|E
40|$|Feature-based {{representation}} {{has become}} a topic of interest in shape modelling techniques. Such feature- based techniques are, however, still restricted to polyhedral shapes, and none {{has been done on}} smooth surfaces. This paper presents a new feature-based ap- proach for smooth surfaces. Here, the smooth surfaces are assumed to be 2 -dimensional @differentiable manifolds within a theoretical framework. As the shape features, critical points such as peaks, pits, and passes are used. We also use a critical point graph called the R. eeb graph to represent the topological skeletons of a smooth object. Since the critical points have close relations with the entities of B-reps, the framework of thtx B-reps can easily be applied to our approach. In our method, the shape design process begins with specifying the topological skeletons using the Reeb graph. The Reeb graph is edited by pasting the enti- ties called cells that have <b>one-to-one</b> <b>correspondences</b> <b>with</b> the critical points. In addition to the topological skeletons, users also design the geometry of the objects with smooth surfaces by specifying the flow curves that run on the object surface. From these flow curves, the system automatically creates a control network that encloses the object shape. The surfaces are interpolated from the control network by minimizing the allergy function subject to the deformation of the surfaces using variational optimization...|$|R
40|$|International {{audience}} The Invention of Number. The {{origin of}} integers 1, 2, 3 etc. is often attributed to activities of bookkeeping, measurement, or goods exchange. Such activities no doubt boosted {{the use of}} arithmetic in the first Empires or City States, {{but they do not}} explain its origin: in fact ethnographic evidence shows a lot of archaic societies inventing sophisticated numerical systems alongside poor goods exchange networks functioning without any help from these systems. The concept of integer is unthinkable without the dialectic, contradictory concept of the « one-many ». Ethnographic evidence and extracts from ancient oriental mythologies show this fundamental element of archaic (aka « traditional », or « primitive ») way of thinking as the main tool for modelling the world and its genesis as the multiplicity of the one. Although the « one intrinsically many » is the typical archaic way of representing creative energy, it cannot explain the variety of the created world. This means that creative energy has to be determined, leading to what I call quanta, quantitative expressions of quality by <b>one-to-one</b> <b>correspondences</b> <b>with</b> alleged key elements of the world (cardinal directions for instance).
