5|$|Madison Avenue {{is part of}} the {{cross-country}} US Route 20, and at four lanes wide it is {{the busiest}} street in the district. Roughly 90 buildings <b>on</b> <b>Madison</b> Avenue face the park. East of the intersection with Robin Street, Madison is more urban with 19th-century rowhouses; west of Robin Street is dominated by large detached residences, many of which have been converted to medical offices. A few buildings, such as 694 and 710 Madison predate park improvements that occurred across the street at the Taylor property, which later became basketball and tennis courts. 682 Madison was formerly the home of the Academy of Holy Names. It is currently administrative offices for the Albany Medical Center Annex.|$|E
5|$|Route 124 {{begins at}} the {{intersection}} of US202 and CR510 at the Park Place square in the downtown of Morristown, Morris County. From here, it heads to the southeast as South Street, a two-lane undivided road that passes businesses. At the intersection with CR663, the road widens to four lanes. A short distance later, CR601 continues southeast on South Street and Route 124 bears left to head east <b>on</b> <b>Madison</b> Avenue, coming to an interchange with Interstate 287. Past this interchange, the road passes Morristown Memorial Hospital and continues through mainly commercial areas with some homes. At the intersection with Normandy Parkway, the route turns to the southeast and enters Morris Township, where it narrows to two lanes again, with New Jersey Transit’s Morristown Line running a short distance to the northeast of the route near the Morris County Golf Club. Route 124 continues into more residential areas and crosses into Madison.|$|E
5|$|Adam Gopnik was {{selected}} to deliver the 2011 Massey Lectures, the annual week-long series of lectures on a political, cultural or philosophical topic given in Canada by a noted scholar. Gopnik was chosen by the panel of representatives from Massey College, House of Anansi Press and the CBC, the organizations responsible for coordinating the lectures. This would be the 50th anniversary of the Massey Lectures and coincide with the 75th anniversary of the CBC. Ideas executive producer Bernie Lucht contacted Gopnik by email to inform him of the panel's decision and {{to ask if he}} would accept. At the time Gopnik was living in New York City, working as a staff writer for The New Yorker magazine. He had previously authored several books on different topics, the most successful being Paris to the Moon, a collection of essays published in 2000. Gopnik read Lucht's email while waiting for a bus <b>on</b> <b>Madison</b> Avenue. Gopnik later stated {{that by the end of}} the 20-minute bus ride he had already selected a topic and had a good idea of the issues he would address.|$|E

25|$|There {{are a few}} {{scattered}} houses {{from around}} the district postdating this period. The ornate brickwork at 77 Westerlo, dating to 1886, stands out in its neighborhood. On the other extreme, the austerity of 68 and 70 Westerlo reflects vernacular applications of early 20th century styles. The greatest change to the district in this period was the conversion of some residences <b>on</b> <b>Madison</b> west of Franklin into stores.|$|E

25|$|The Mansion District {{took off}} in the 1850s. The city's economy was booming due to the canal, the railroads and the {{industrialization}} taking place. The new workers, many of them Irish immigrants, coming to the city needed houses, and the Pastures had mostly been built out. Developers therefore looked to the emptier lands to the west. Orr developed houses <b>on</b> <b>Madison,</b> Myrtle and Park as well as Grand Street. He was joined by Charles and Lewis Seymour, stonemasons who built the row at 44–50 Grand and possibly several others. Lewis Seymour's slightly unusual frame house still stands at 14 Wilbur Street.|$|E
25|$|William Croswell Doane, {{elected the}} first {{bishop of the}} Episcopal Diocese of Albany upon its 1868 creation, saw the {{potential}} for growth {{of the church in}} places it had not previously been.

25|$|The {{original}} {{alignment of}} NY14 through Elmira took the designation along Broadway and Fulton, Hudson, Main, Water, and Lake streets. Outside of Elmira, it continued north through Elmira Heights to Horseheads on Lake Road and Main Street. At the time, NY17 entered Horseheads on Big Flats Road and proceeded south to downtown Elmira {{by way of}} Corning Road, Oakwood Avenue, Thurston Street, College Avenue, Park Place, and Main Street. By 1932, NY14 was rerouted to follow Pennsylvania Avenue into downtown Elmira, from where it continued to Horseheads <b>on</b> <b>Madison</b> Avenue, Church, William, Lake, and Division streets, and Grand Central Avenue. From Water Street to Horseheads, NY14 overlapped with a realigned NY17. Most of NY14's former routing along Broadway became part of an extended NY328.|$|E
25|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route24, an {{unsigned}} legislative {{route that}} initially extended from Fonda to Lake Pleasant via Johnstown, Gloversville, Mayfield, and Speculator. From Fonda {{to the southern}} edge of Johnstown, Route24 utilized modern NY30A. Northeast of Gloversville, it followed East State Street, current County Route154, and Riceville Road to Mayfield. In between, it was routed along several city streets in Johnstown and Gloversville. All of legislative Route24 south of Speculator was designated as part of NY54 in the mid-1920s. Like Route24 before it, NY54 followed a series of local streets through Johnstown and Gloversville. It entered Johnstown on Chestnut Street and proceeded northward through the city <b>on</b> <b>Madison</b> Avenue and Perry Street. In Gloversville, Perry Street became Main Street, which NY54 followed to State Street.|$|E
