5|$|Surveys {{taken during}} 1932 and 1933 {{proved that the}} skyway saved time on the new and old routes.

During times of previous traffic congestion on weekends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> route, the viaduct saved around 25minutes or more from the elimination of traffic congestion. In addition, the new route {{did not have the}} much longer delays and traffic back-ups that were caused whenever the bridges <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> highway were opened. It was found that the skyway also diverted a good deal of traffic from other routes.|$|E

A new drive system was installed, which provides a much higher pointing accuracy. The outer track was relaid, and the focal tower was strengthened so that it could support heavier receivers.|$|E
