50|$|Differences in {{processing}} from <b>other</b> <b>yarn</b> manufacturers {{include the use}} of a single roller on the carding machine instead of the usual three, hand-feeding tufts of fiber into the carding machine, and the arrangement of specified color runs by hand. The single roller as well as the shorter bed on the spinning machine result in less twist to the single ply than other yarns, giving a variance in thickness along its length.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{use for the}} {{technique}} is when working stranded color patterns, in which two yarns are alternated to certain of the stitches to create patterns. Weaving is used to attach the horizontal strands of yarn that pass unused behind stitches formed with the <b>other</b> <b>yarn</b> {{to the inside of}} the fabric. This is usually done to prevent overlong [...] "floats" [...] on the inside to prevent snags and create an even tension in the fabric.|$|E
50|$|Many novelty yarns {{make use}} of special plying {{techniques}} to gain their special effects. By varying {{the tension in the}} strands, or the relative sizes of the strands, or many other factors different effects can be achieved. For example, when a soft, thick strand is plied against a tightly twisted thin strand, the resulting yarn spirals. Another example is bouclé, which is a yarn where one strand is held loosely and allowed to make loops on the <b>other</b> <b>yarn</b> while plying.|$|E

25|$|Rubber {{produced}} as a fiber, sometimes called 'elastic', had significant {{value to the}} textile industry because of its excellent elongation and recovery properties. For these purposes, manufactured rubber fiber was made as either an extruded round fiber or rectangular fibers cut into strips from extruded film. Because of its low dye acceptance, feel and appearance, the rubber fiber was either covered by yarn of another fiber or directly woven with <b>other</b> <b>yarns</b> into the fabric. Rubber yarns were used in foundation garments.|$|R
40|$|Characteristics of air-jet {{textured}} yarns {{are determined by}} the instability, linear density, and strength, together with structural properties such as loop size, loop frequency, and degree of entanglement. Such characteristics are affected by various process parameters and supply yarn properties. The effects of these parameters on the final yarn properties have been investigated using instability, linear density, and strength tests, together with SEM photographs for visual assessment of the yarn structure. Optimizing any given yarn property almost always affects <b>other</b> <b>yarn</b> characteristics, and therefore this must be remembered when selecting suitable process parameters and supply yarns for specific end uses. For a given texturing nozzle and conditions, there is an optimum filament fineness and number of filaments that can be textured effectively...|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} {{process for}} the dry spinning of carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn is reported. The approach gives an improved structure of CNT bundles in the web drawn from the CNT forest and in the yarn produced from the twisted web leading to improved mechanical properties of the yarn. The process enables many different mechanical and physical treatments {{to be applied to}} the individual stages of the pure CNT spinning system, and may allow potential for the development of complex spinning processes such as polymer–CNT-based composite yarns. The tensile strength and yarn/web structure of yarn spun using this approach have been investigated and evaluated using standard tensile testing methods along with scanning electron microscopy. The experimental results show that the tensile properties were significantly improved. The effect of heat treatments and <b>other</b> <b>yarn</b> constructions on the tensile properties are also reported...|$|E
40|$|The air-jet {{texturing}} process is briefly introduced and its advantages over other texturing processes are summarized. Characteristics of air-jet textured yarns are stated with special {{reference to the}} stability of the yarns. Test methods used in industry and research to determine the "stability" or "instability" of air-jet textured yarns are critically reviewed. These methods involve different basic principles and therefore inevitably give different results. There is no consensus on a standard method. Effects of various test parameters, such as specimen length, test duration, and the alternatives of using a single yarn, a hank, or a skein as a test specimen are investigated. An improved test method is suggested as a standard instability test, and various existing methods are compared with it. Results of all the methods show similar trends for varying values of air pressure. <b>Other</b> <b>yarn</b> characteristics such as linear density, breaking elongation, and tenacity are also determined, and their indications of yarn quality are compared with the indications of instability tests. Stability test results alone provide misleading information regarding air-jet textured yarn quality...|$|E

40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} this article (may not be free). Structural {{analysis}} at the nano and micro scale {{was performed on}} a carbon nanotube (CNT) multi-yarn. The yarns were made by a process of drawing CNTs into a ribbon and twisting the ribbon into a yarn. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to view {{the exterior of the}} yarn. Polarized microscopy was used to examine details of the 1 -yarn, and it also identified ribbon-ribbon boundaries. Further examination of interior structure was done by NanoCT scans which showed that folding of the ribbons had occurred causing complicated structures. The interior folding was found by milling into the yarn with a focus ion beam gun (FIB) and imaging with SEM. These different methods thus provided various microstructural details (structure, ribbon-ribbon boundary, folding and void fraction) of CNT multi-yarn which could be used to compare with <b>other</b> <b>yarns</b> fabricated with different procedures/sources as well to provide parameters for analytical tools. Further, these microstructural details can be related to macro mechanical and physical properties...|$|R
30|$|Merchant-manufacturers in Norwich, a {{major centre}} for textile {{production}} in England, used pattern books and pattern cards containing swatches of worsted and worsted mixed with <b>other</b> <b>yarns</b> to facilitate sales and trade. Studying such well-preserved and dated materials provides valuable {{information that can}} translate into informed decisions {{for the care of}} Norwich textile collections. Using a Norwich pattern book from Winterthur Museum’s Special Collections dated c. 1790 – 1793, we report the first stage of a substantial study that combines spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques with archival research. A combination of X-ray fluorescence (XRF), high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array (HPLC–PDA) and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM–EDX) allowed for identification of characteristic mordants like iron and tin salts; and dyes, like quercitron, native to North America. In addition, a combination of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) allowed for partial identification of the glazed finish in some textiles as a natural gum. Setting the foundations for future conservation and conservation science work, our research contributes to the care of these important and beautiful textiles, by providing scientific evidence for humidity and/or light sensitive constituent materials.|$|R
40|$|To improve {{yarn quality}} in ring {{spinning}} frame, this paper examines transposal spinning with the movable balloon control ring. The left-transposal spinning and the right-transposal spinning were experimented to spin two yarns; after installing the movable balloon control ring, the two methods were respectively used to spin two <b>other</b> <b>yarns</b> again. All the experiments {{were on the}} same ring frame and the raw material was wool/polyester blend roving with a ration of 30 / 70. The main quality indexes of the four yarns were tested and analyzed, including hairiness, tensile property, evenness and usual faults. The results show that the yarn spun by the left-transposal spinning has a better quality than the right-transposal spinning, and after adding the movable balloon control ring, the improvement of yarn hairiness strength and evenness, as well usual faults, is very obvious. So, in the advantage of transposal spinning, the method of installing the movable balloon control ring can improve some deteriorative problems and make yarn quality better. In addition, the method gives new insight into energy efficiency. The research in this field in on the way and the result is in accord with the Low-carbon Economy...|$|R
40|$|Section of red fringe. A {{continuous}} cord of 7 {{strands of}} yarn forms the long fringe. This cord was twisted on itself at regular intervals so {{that each of the}} intact strands is looped at the loose end. The same yarn was used as two singles to wrap around each side of the 7 strand cord just before it twists on itself. Each of these yarns was chained between each fringe. A third chain was formed above these two and a single yarn looped through it at regular intervals (four between each fringe) from above where it also was looped through a separate chain. This chained and looped support for the loose cords is approximately 1 cm wide.; Somewhat dirty and worn. There is a break in the support for the fringe cord, although the cord itself is intact. Many of the smaller yarns going through the top chain are broken. Some of the yarns at the ends of the fringe cords are broken although most of the loops are still intact.
