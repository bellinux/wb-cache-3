5|$|Story and {{characters}} were a primary concern for Gilbert and Winnick. The pair based the game's cast <b>on</b> <b>friends,</b> family members, acquaintances, and stereotypes. For example, Winnick's girlfriend Ray was {{the inspiration for}} Razor, while Dave and Wendy were based, respectively, on Gilbert and a fellow Lucasfilm employee named Wendy. According to Winnick, the Edison family was shaped after characters from EC Comics and Warren Publishing magazines. The sentient meteor that brainwashes Dr. Fred {{was inspired by a}} segment from the 1982 anthology film Creepshow. A man-eating plant, similar to that of Little Shop of Horrors, was included as well. The developers sought {{to strike a balance between}} tension and humor with the game's story.|$|E
5|$|The debtors' {{prison at}} the castle {{came in for}} {{particular}} scrutiny. It emerged {{that out of the}} 402 cases brought before the court at St Briavels' Castle, 397 of them were for extremely small sums of debt of £5 or less (£373 in 2009 prices), increasingly unacceptable in Victorian eyes. A penalty of up to £7 (£522 in 2009 prices) was also being charged for each case, making the process extremely onerous for the local poor being prosecuted in this way. The investigation found that the keeper of the debtors' prison, which could hold up to six inmates at a time, was appointed by the constable, and made part of his income by charging each prisoner one shilling a week {{for the use of the}} beds in the prison; with no other public funding, prisoners depended <b>on</b> <b>friends</b> or relatives for food and other essentials, or from donations from their original parishes.|$|E
5|$|The role of Rachel was {{originally}} offered to actresses Téa Leoni, the producer's first choice, and Courteney Cox, {{both of whom}} declined, Leoni in favor of starring in the sitcom The Naked Truth, and Cox in favor of playing Rachel's best friend Monica in Friends. A virtually unknown actress at the time who had previously starred in five short-lived sitcoms, Aniston auditioned {{for the role of}} Rachel after turning down an offer as a cast member on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. After acquiring the role and before Friends aired, Aniston was temporarily at risk of being recast because she had also been involved with another sitcom, Muddling Through, at the time, which was ultimately canceled and allowed Aniston to remain <b>on</b> <b>Friends.</b>|$|E

5|$|When {{drawing the}} manga, Tsukudani aimed to write scenes that {{were easy to}} read, {{something}} {{she felt she was}} unable to do well when the manga's serialization began. What she felt was most important was depicting the characters as cute as possible. When developing the characters, she based the female members of the student council and Tadokoro <b>on</b> <b>friends</b> she had in the drama club when she was a student. However, Hime was created from scratch using Tsukudani's ideals for a cross-dressing boy as a basis for the character including his pink hair, side pigtails, and him being forced to cross-dress. When developing the members of the public morals committee, Tsukudani had already decided on having a pair of cross-dressing brothers, which led to Kaguya's development. Tsukudani's editor suggested making Kaguya the protagonist of the spin-off manga Himegoto+, and she wanted to give Kaguya a partner, so she created No. 1 and thought she might as well make her into a cross-dressing girl. For Mitsunaga and Hiro, she wanted them to cross-dress due to some preconceived issue. Tsukudani was careful to design the characters to maintain a balance between them, including what hair color they would have.|$|E

25|$|Suppose {{the edges}} of a {{complete}} graph on 6 vertices are coloured red and blue. Pick a vertex, v. There are 5 edges incident to v and so (by the pigeonhole principle) at least 3 of them must be the same colour. Without loss of generality we can assume at least 3 of these edges, connecting the vertex, v, to vertices, r, s and t, are blue. (If not, exchange red and blue in what follows.) If any of the edges, (r, s), (r, t), (s, t), are also blue then we have an entirely blue triangle. If not, then those three edges are all red {{and we have an}} entirely red triangle. Since this argument works for any colouring, any K6 contains a monochromatic K3, and therefore R(3, 3) ≤ 6. The popular version of this is called the theorem <b>on</b> <b>friends</b> and strangers.|$|E

500|$|During {{production}} on Watermelon Man for Columbia Pictures, Van Peebles attempted {{to rewrite the}} script in order to change it from a comedy poking fun of white liberals into the first black power film.

Raucher ultimately exercised a clause in his contract that allowed him to novelize his own script, effectively preventing Peebles from too radically changing the film.|$|E
