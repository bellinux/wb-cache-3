5|$|In 1999, {{the band}} self-released an EP titled First Impressions {{which was the}} product of a two-day session at A-Room Studios with Brian Tochilin. Only 1,000 copies were made and the band members sold them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars.</b> Working with Death by Stereo's Paul Miner, the quartet {{recorded}} 12 tracks, and by April 2000, the group had released Identity Crisis on Greenflag Records. A portion of the album's proceeds were donated to a local charity called Crittenton Services for Children and Families. More support gigs and local buzz followed, and Thrice sparked the interest of Hopeless/Sub City's Louis Posen. In 2001, Posen signed with the band, reissued Identity Crisis, and sent the group out on tour with Samiam. Tours with Midtown and Hot Rod Circuit followed.|$|E
25|$|Two {{months after}} Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, Louisville's West End rioted. On May 27, 1968, {{a protest against}} police {{brutality}} was happening at Twenty-eighth and Greenwood Streets that eventually turned violent when the Louisville police jumped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> with their guns already drawn. Louie B. Nunn called out the National Guard. 472 arrests were made, $200,000 in damages happened, and James Groves Jr, 14, and Washington Browder, 19, were murdered. Washington Browder had a fish sandwich still clutched in his hand when found on the sidewalk, shot dead, by a business owner. James Groves Jr. {{was shot in the}} back, after supposedly looting during the riots.|$|E
25|$|The attack began poorly. The caravan of {{automobiles}} became separated {{by the time}} it arrived at the barracks, and the car carrying the guerillas' heavy weapons got lost. Furthermore, many of the rebels who would have taken part in the attack were left behind for a lack of weapons. In Castro's autobiography, he claims that he drove his car into a group of soldiers at the gate who had realized an attack was in progress. The men in the cars behind him jumped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars,</b> believing they were inside the barracks, and the alarm was sounded before the barracks had been infiltrated. According to Castro, this was the fatal mistake in the operation. The net result of these events was the rebels being outnumbered more than 10 to 1.|$|E

At the time of the fire, investigating police speculated that the seven had climbed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> and unsuccessfully tried to find {{their way out of the}} tunnel; had they stayed in the cars, they might have survived. Other evacuated passengers reported seeing empty cars exit the tunnel on fire.|$|E
