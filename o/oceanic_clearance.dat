40|$|Transatlantic flight {{operations}} are, {{due to the}} absence of radar-based surveillance, the influence of the polar jet stream and the highly directional traffic peaks, significantly different compared to continental {{flight operations}}. To safely accommodate all transatlantic traffic in the North Atlantic oceanic airspace the Organized Track System (OTS) has been established, existing of a number of pre-determined flight routes. Currently, about half of all transatlantic traffic uses the OTS which is created twice a day, once to accommodate the westbound traffic and once to accommodate the eastbound traffic flow. All aircraft requesting to use the OTS send an <b>oceanic</b> <b>clearance</b> request to the oceanic planning controller, containing the estimated time of arrival at the track entry boundary, the preferred OTS track, flight level and Mach number. The aircraft are cleared onto the OTS using a first-come, first-served (FCFS) approach, taking the separation requirements with already cleared aircraft into account. If an <b>oceanic</b> <b>clearance</b> request cannot be granted due to a potential loss of separation, the requesting aircraft will receive an alternative clearance. The research objectives of this thesis assignment are to: “Reduce the total direct operating cost of transatlantic air traffic by optimizing the OTS track allocation procedure using a real-time meta-heuristic scheduling algorithm” “Create a model capable of optimizing the OTS track allocation procedure for different cost-index values” This research aims at improving the current OTS track allocation procedure by changing the first-come, first-served approach, currently used, to a scheduling concept in which the total direct operating cost (DOC) is minimized for a large number of aircraft in a single optimization window. The use of a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm is proposed in this thesis project and the potential of using stochastic optimization for large scheduling problems is researched. The direct operating cost penalties for the possible alternative clearances is determined using fuel consumption models in combination with time cost models. The created population algorithm is tested for multiple cost-index values, using real life problems, and the results are compared to the existing OTS track allocation procedure. The generated results show a potential direct operating cost reduction as well as the possibility to use the created track allocation algorithm as a real-time decision support tool for the oceanic planning controller.

At this time a loud sound was recorded on the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) at 19:02:50. Five radar echoes fanning out appeared, instead of one.

40|$|Allowing {{aircraft}} to descend uninterrupted at low engine power, continuous descent operations promise to maximize fuel efficiency while minimizing environmental impact. Tailored Arrivals {{is a concept}} for enabling continuous descents under constrained airspace conditions by integrating advanced air and ground automation through digital datalink. Operational trials were completed in January 2007 involving trans-pacific flights into San Francisco during early morning hours. Leveraging newly deployed FAA automation in the <b>Oceanic</b> environment, trajectory-based <b>clearances</b> were transmitted by datalink to Boeing 777 aircraft equipped with Future Air Navigation System avionics. NASA’s prototype, ground-based automation for high-density arrival management tailored trajectory clearances to accommodate artificially imposed metering constraints. Upon sharing wind and descent-speed-intent data, ground-based and airborne automation were found to predict meter-fix arrival times to within a mean accuracy of 3 seconds over a 25 -minute prediction horizon. Corresponding mean altitude and along-track prediction errors of ground-based automation were- 500 ft and- 1. 3 nmi, respectively, in comparison to surveillance truth. A benefits analysis suggests Boeing 777 fuel savings of between 200 and 3, 000 lbs per flight – depending highly upon baseline traffic conditions – together with a corresponding reduction in CO 2 emissions of between 700 and 10, 000 lbs per flight.
