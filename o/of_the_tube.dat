5|$|An old style mercury {{barometer}} {{consists of a}} vertical glass tube about 1cm in diameter partially filled with mercury, and with a vacuum (called Torricelli's vacuum) in the unfilled volume (see diagram to the right). Notice that the mercury level at the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> is higher than at the edges, making the upper surface of the mercury dome-shaped. The center of mass of the entire column of mercury would be slightly lower if the top surface of the mercury were flat over the entire cross-section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube.</b> But the dome-shaped top gives slightly less surface area to the entire mass of mercury. Again the two effects combine to minimize the total potential energy. Such a surface shape {{is known as a}} convex meniscus.|$|E
5|$|No single {{method for}} {{confirming}} tracheal tube placement {{has been shown}} to be 100% reliable. Accordingly, the use of multiple methods for confirmation of correct tube placement is now widely considered to be the standard of care. Such methods include direct visualization as the tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> passes through the glottis, or indirect visualization of the tracheal tube within the trachea using a device such as a bronchoscope. With a properly positioned tracheal tube, equal bilateral breath sounds will be heard upon listening to the chest with a stethoscope, and no sound upon listening to the area over the stomach. Equal bilateral rise and fall of the chest wall will be evident with ventilatory excursions. A small amount of water vapor will also be evident within the lumen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> with each exhalation and there will be no gastric contents in the tracheal tube at any time.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development and}} properties of seamless aluminum-clad P 75 /Epoxy <b>tubes</b> and <b>the</b> unique manufacturing method used in their production. Thermo-mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> were determined analytically and verified by tests. These properties were shown to be suitable for space structures that require high stiffness, low weight and thermal expansion, and dimensional stability during operational life. A special feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> is <b>the</b> ability to tune <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> for thermal expansion after fabrication by a chemical milling process. <b>The</b> <b>tubes</b> are also resistant to atomic oxygen and handling damage. <b>The</b> toughness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> was demonstrated by impact testing. Cyclic thermal testing showed no adverse effects on the expansion and stiffness behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubes.</b> <b>The</b> paper also includes a discussion of a joining method that uses aluminum end fittings and an efficient scarf joint configuration. Additional studies considered various adhesives and fitting materials.

5|$|Because {{most of the}} {{pipeline}} was built above permafrost, each of the pipes holding up the raised sections of pipeline contained a sealed tube of ammonia. As the permafrost below {{the pipeline}} warms, the ammonia absorbs the heat and rises to a radiator {{on top of each}} stanchion. The ammonia is cooled by the outside air, condenses, and falls back to the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube,</b> where the process repeats.|$|E
5|$|DX arrays {{have been}} made to form hollow {{nanotubes}} 4–20nm in diameter, essentially two-dimensional lattices which curve back upon themselves. These DNA nanotubes are somewhat similar in size and shape to carbon nanotubes, and while they lack the electrical conductance of carbon nanotubes, DNA nanotubes are more easily modified and connected to other structures. One of many schemes for constructing DNA nanotubes uses a lattice of curved DX tiles that curls around itself and closes into a tube. In an alternative method that allows the circumference to be specified in a simple, modular fashion using single-stranded tiles, the rigidity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> is an emergent property.|$|E

5|$|For {{infants and}} young children, orotracheal {{intubation}} {{is easier than}} the nasotracheal route. Nasotracheal intubation carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and nasal bleeding. Despite the greater difficulty, nasotracheal intubation route is preferable to orotracheal intubation in children undergoing intensive care and requiring prolonged intubation because this route allows a more secure fixation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube.</b> As with adults, {{there are a number}} of devices specially designed for assistance with difficult tracheal intubation in children. Confirmation of proper position of the tracheal tube is accomplished as with adult patients.|$|E
5|$|Forming {{the sides}} {{of the back of the}} skull is the exoccipital, which {{surrounds}} most of the foramen magnum. The Eustachian tube extends downwards across the basoccipital and basisphenoid; these bones are thickened on either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> in K. langenbergensis. K. guimarotae has a small rounded foramen beside the tube on the basoccipital, and a tuberosity bearing a ridge above. On the front of the basoccipital in both species, there are two rounded depressions near the bottom. The basisphenoid resembles a triangular hatchet in shape when viewed from the side.|$|E

50|$|Evaporation {{of liquid}} film in film {{evaporators}} {{is very important}} in order to cool the flowing liquid and the surface on which the liquid flows. It can also increase <b>the</b> concentration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> components in the liquid. The climbing/falling film plate evaporator is specifically designed to produce a thin film during both the climbing and falling phases. For the climbing film evaporators, the feed is introduced at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubes.</b> Evaporation causes <b>the</b> vapor to expand thus causing a thin film of liquid to rise along <b>the</b> <b>tubes.</b> <b>The</b> vapor shear will push the thin film to climb up <b>the</b> wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubes.</b> <b>The</b> feed for the falling film evaporator on the other hand is introduced at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubes.</b> <b>The</b> liquid flows down <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> and it will get evaporated as it descends. <b>The</b> flow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquid down <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> is driven by the vapor shear stress and the gravitational forces. <b>The</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vapor shear and the gravity will lead to a higher flow rates and shorter residence time. <b>The</b> flow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thin liquid film in the falling film evaporator is possible in two ways: cocurrent and countercurrent. It is cocurrent if the vapor is drawn from the top to <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> and vice versa for the countercurrent flow. The cocurrent flow will increase the flow rates resulting in a shorter residence time. <b>The</b> type <b>of</b> flow can be described in figure 2.|$|R

5|$|The {{official}} {{opening of the}} GNP by David Lloyd George, President of the Board of Trade, took place on 15 December 1906.

5|$|The {{rarefaction}} {{is reflected}} off the sloping end {{wall of the}} clarinet mouthpiece. The opening between the reed and the mouthpiece makes very little difference to {{the reflection of the}} rarefaction wave.

5|$|Voyager 1s Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS), now disabled, {{consisted}} of two cameras: a 200mm focal length, low-resolution wide-angle camera (WA), used for spatially extended imaging, and a 1500mm high-resolution narrow-angle camera (NA) – the one that took Pale Blue Dot – intended for detailed imaging of specific targets.

5|$|When the rarefication wave {{reaches the}} other (open) end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube,</b> air rushes in {{to fill the}} slight vacuum.

Once the compression wave reaches the mouthpiece end of the 'tube', it is reflected again back down the pipe. However at this time, either because the compression wave 'bumped' the reed or because of the natural vibration cycle of the reed, the gap opens and another 'puff' of air is sent down the pipe.|$|E
5|$|With Chadwick {{involved}} {{the main goal}} was {{to show that the}} Quebec Agreement was a success. It was Britain's duty to co-operate to the fullest and speed along the process. Chadwick used this opportunity to give as many young British scientists experience as possible so that they might carry that experience to post-war Britain. He eventually convinced Groves of Rotblat's integrity to the cause, and this led to Rotblat being accepted to the Manhattan Project without renouncing his nationality. Rotblat had been left in charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tube</b> Alloys research, and brought with him the results obtained since Chadwick had left.|$|E
40|$|A {{very serious}} problem to {{consider}} in <b>the</b> mechanical design <b>of</b> Shell and Tube Heat Exchangers is the vibrations induced in <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> by <b>the</b> fluid pass. <b>The</b> vibration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shell and <b>Tube</b> Heat Exchangers is a factor that limits <b>the</b> operation <b>of</b> these equipments in important way. <b>The</b> dynamic processes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonstationary fluids that happen during the flow produce vibrations. These are turbulent pulsations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pressure (turbulent flow), initiation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vortex and separation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> during <b>the</b> crossing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> currents, hydro elastic interaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assemblies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transmitting elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heat (<b>tubes)</b> with <b>the</b> flow, and acoustic phenomena.

50|$|When {{no fluid}} is flowing, <b>the</b> motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two <b>tubes</b> is symmetrical, {{as shown in}} the left {{animation}}. The animation on the right illustrates what happens during mass flow: some twisting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubes.</b> <b>The</b> arm carrying the flow away from <b>the</b> axis <b>of</b> rotation must exert a force on the fluid to accelerate the flowing mass to <b>the</b> vibrating speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> at <b>the</b> outside (increase <b>of</b> absolute angular momentum), so it is lagging behind the overall vibration. The arm through which fluid is pushed back towards <b>the</b> axis <b>of</b> movement must exert a force on the fluid to decrease the fluid's absolute angular speed (angular momentum) again, hence that arm leads the overall vibration.|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{methods for}} {{simulating}} hollow and foam-filled flax-fabric-reinforced epoxy tubular energy absorbers subjected to lateral crashing are presented.
