5|$|Back at her apartment, Scully runs a {{background}} check of Doggett on her computer, learning about his background as a former NYPD detective. She feels sick and leaves the computer, and later on calls her mom, Margaret (Sheila Larken). When she realizes her phone is tapped, she looks <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> {{to see if anyone}} is out there. She angrily calls Doggett to protest him monitoring her phone conversations, which he seems genuinely surprised about. She notices a mysterious man and runs into the hall to pursue him, but meets her landlord Mr. Coeben who tells her that he had seen Mulder.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue was}} whether the {{exterior}} shutter over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box {{at the top of}} the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside. Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.|$|E
5|$|One {{challenge}} for the production team was how to convey Bella's depression once Edward departs. In the novel, these pages were filled {{with the names of}} the passing months, and in the movie, would be represented as a visual effects shot with a camera circling around Kristen Stewart. The window that was used for the original film did not quite fit what Weitz was looking for, so the production team created a bay window when recreating the Swan house. The effect was one of the 300 visual effects helmed by Prime Focus led by visual effects supervisor Eric Pascarelli. It required matching two camera shots: one that shot the actress in a chair, and the other shooting the view <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> as seen from the house built on location. Using a greenscreen, Prime Focus was able to enhance the changing of seasons with computer-generated leaves and falling snow.|$|E
50|$|The {{buildings}} have twisted brick chimneys and characteristic wooden racks for drying laundry <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
60|$|For {{there was}} a large and high hill <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> which overshadowed <b>the</b> palace so much that the sun could not shine in.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} was full leather, with full instrumentation in an engine-turned dash. As on early aircraft and custom boats, padded armrests were mounted <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> a rare touch.|$|R
5|$|As {{the train}} departs towards King's Cross, Rubeus Hagrid waves riders goodbye {{outside of the}} window. Shadows of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger can also been seen walking down the train corridor, looking for an empty compartment. Following this, Buckbeak flies <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> while Hogwarts {{can be seen in}} the background. Shortly after, the train enters a forest where centaurs are running. Upon exiting the forest, Hogwarts can be seen once again in the background. Fred and George Weasley appear, flying broomsticks and playing with fireworks. The Hogwarts Express then enters a tunnel, after which riders find {{themselves}} in the middle of a storm and pass Malfoy Manor. The journey then enters a second tunnel; Harry, Ron, and Hermione appear again in the train corridor. As a spider crawls up the compartment door, Ron eats it and the trio continue to walk on down the corridor. After the tunnel the journey continues into London passing by an industrial factory and then a residential area. The Knight Bus then appears; squeezing between buildings and shrinking to pass under a bridge. As the bus drives away, the train enters King's Cross station, where Alastor Moody greets passengers.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} sees Little Mix {{adopting}} a new heavier look including leather outfits, bullet chains and gothic makeup, and explores themes of jealousy and obsession. It features the group hunting down {{men who have}} wronged them. Filmed in comic book movie style, Little Mix play female assassins who stalk and then kidnap men they are obsessed with. In one scene, Perrie Edwards is angrily driving a car while next to a male passenger who is bound and gagged. Edwards sports glossy red lipstick and a biker jacket, keeping {{her eyes on the}} road and paying no mind to the camera as wind blows through her hair. Jade Thirlwall is seen stalking a man outside his bedroom window. Standing <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> ledge, Thirlwall spies on a man who captured her heart. Thirlwall wears metallic silver and black striped highwaisted trousers, with a white shirt, black bow tie and braces. Jesy Nelson's scene {{is similar to that of}} Edwards. Nelson races to her destination in a vintage convertible with a lace visor covering her eyes as police sirens flash behind her. In another scene, Leigh-Anne Pinnock masterminds the story's plots in a secret room with a wall of evidence the group has compiled, of which includes maps and clippings.|$|E
5|$|Later, Howard {{arrives at}} Mickey's Diner and uses their {{phone to call}} home. As {{he tried to get}} a hold of Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the {{argument}} and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As they sat down and talk, Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They hear on the KQRS radio station that the D.J. is running a Turbo-Man competition. When they get to the studio, they find out they can only win a gift certificate. They are nearly arrested, but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package (which he claims is a mail bomb, unaware that it really is one). Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree, Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll from Ted's house that he had bought for his son Johnny (E.J. De La Pena), but changes his mind at the last moment as he could not see himself stealing from a child. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer but manages to lock him up but he unintentionally sets some of his stuff on fire he tires to put it out but kicks it <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> This commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz. Liz and Jamie leave for the local Wintertainment Parade with Ted and Johnny; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz, but after seeing what he really is, she turns him down by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog.|$|E

5|$|When Brian {{approaches}} Stewie {{about helping}} him find {{a tennis ball}} he'd buried, Stewie asks if Brian remembers the date that he lost it. Brian tells him that he buried it on January 31, 1999 (the day of the series' premiere on Fox). Using Stewie's time machine to travel back to that date, the two soon come upon the Griffin family, but notice that their past looks more strange than they remembered it: The family continually pauses for cutaways, and Meg's voice sounds different. Telling Brian that he mustn't alter the past by getting the tennis ball {{and that he should}} instead memorize its location, Stewie goes into his room to set up their return to the present before Past Stewie suddenly enters. The two Stewies then meet, and Stewie tells Brian to come out from his hiding place after explaining himself to Past Stewie. However, hanging <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> Brian fell onto Past Peter's car as he drives to the bachelor party at past Glenn Quagmire's house. Stewie finds Brian and the two then attempt to return to the present, but find that the transportation device's batteries are running low and moved only a bit forward in time towards their destination. Later, the two manage to take advantage of Peter dumping his extra welfare money out of a blimp above Super Bowl XXXIII to collect the money needed to purchase new batteries. It was only after the two return to the present that Stewie learns that Brian intentionally told his past self about the September 11 attacks ahead of time, allowing the Past Brian to beat American Airlines Flight 11 hijackers Mohamed Atta and Abdulaziz al-Omari with a baseball bat, and then preventing the other three planes from leaving the airports.|$|E

The oranges which lie on the window sill and chest may symbolize the purity and innocence that reigned in the Garden of Eden before the Fall of Man. They were uncommon and a sign of wealth in the Netherlands, but in Italy were a symbol of fecundity in marriage. The fruit could more simply {{be a sign of}} the couple's wealth since oranges were very expensive imports. It could be a sign of fertility as well.|$|E

25|$|The film's villain, Freddy Krueger, draws {{heavily from}} Craven's early life. One night, a young Craven saw {{an elderly man}} walking on the sidepath <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of his home. The man stopped to glance at a startled Craven and walked off. This served as the {{inspiration}} for Krueger. Initially, Fred Krueger {{was intended to be}} a child molester, but Craven eventually characterized him as a child murderer to avoid being accused of exploiting a spate of highly publicized child molestation cases that occurred in California around the time of production of the film.|$|E
25|$|In New York City on Christmas Eve of 1992, an 8-year-old {{boy named}} Grant wakes {{to find the}} Doctor {{dangling}} <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of his family's apartment and helps him come into his bedroom. Taking the boy to the rooftop, the Doctor reveals he accidentally set off a trap for a device he was building, and he enlists Grant to help complete it. However Grant mistakenly swallows a wish-granting gemstone needed for the device, believing it to be medicine, effectively being granted his wish to be a superhero. Abandoning the device, the Doctor makes Grant promise to not use his new superpowers before he leaves.|$|E
25|$|The {{elevator}} rises for a {{few seconds}} before coming to its first stop. The doors open to reveal a long, dimly lit hotel corridor, with overgrown plants and doors to guest rooms, with morning newspapers and room-service trays outside, along its length. There is a single window {{at the opposite end of}} the corridor. A violent thunderstorm is raging and lightning flashes <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> The five missing passengers from 1939 appear for several moments, turning to face the elevator and beckoning the guests to join them. Then they disappear in a burst of electricity. The corridor fades away, but the window remains until it appears to be floating in a dark field of stars. The window morphs into the window from the Season 5 opening sequence, and breaks.|$|E
50|$|The climb is nicknamed The Italian Hill, {{because of}} the {{composition}} of its immigrant population and their descendants - often from Sicily and the South of Italy.

500|$|The episode {{then returns}} to the treehouse and Bart, Lisa and Maggie, who are not frightened {{by any of the}} stories. They climb down from the treehouse and sleep peacefully the whole night. Homer, on the other hand, lies in his bed terrified. As he notices a raven <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> similar to the one from the poem, Homer exclaims that he [...] "hates Halloween" [...] and hides under the sheets.|$|E
500|$|Despite his success, Homer {{notices that}} his team members are {{starting}} to get overworked. He decides that the solution is to get them hammocks and visits Scorpio to ask where he can purchase some. Scorpio begins to tell Homer of [...] "the Hammock district", but he is interrupted by some urgent business. It turns out that Scorpio is a criminal mastermind formulating a plot to take over the East Coast of the United States with a doomsday device, as he turns to a screen and threatens the United Nations Security Council by declaring that he has got hold of the doomsday device and that they have 72 hours to meet his demand of gold. To prove his intent, he blows up the 59th Street Bridge. Despite being in the same room, Homer appears oblivious to Scorpio's nefarious plan as he was looking <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the performance, {{according}} to Ted Shaffrey, [...] "Before he emerged from the phone-booth sized contraption of clear plastic and steel, Angel yanked out the air hose that allowed him to breathe. Then assistants pulled a black curtain over the 220-gallon (832-liter) chamber to block the view of television cameras and about 100 people gathered <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> in which he was displayed. Under cover, Angel apparently escaped from the shackles that bound his arms, legs and neck, before pulling himself from the watery chamber with a celebratory scream." [...] Upon successfully completing the trick, he was described as having [...] "skin crinkled and his eyes bloodshot", and upon emerging from the tank he was taken to St. Clare's Hospital and treated for severe dehydration. He reported afterwards that he had suffered from overheating, jaw fatigue, and semi-consciousness while in the tank.|$|E

5000|$|... "A Winter's Tale" [...] {{is a song}} by Queen, {{from the}} album Made in Heaven, {{released}} in 1995 after Freddie Mercury's death in 1991. It was written after the Innuendo sessions, inspired as Mercury was staring out <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> of his hospital, at Lake Geneva. The song has a psychedelic, dreamy feel, and describes what Mercury saw <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R

OpenLink Software produced a Driver Manager-less ODBC SDK that it branded as Universal DataBase Connectivity (UDBC) in 1993, because of the sporadic nature of shared library implementations across Unix platforms. Ke Jin used UDBC as inspiration for building a Driver Manager for ODBC <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> platform.|$|R
500|$|After Hole's 1991 tour concluded, a {{music video}} for the track [...] "Garbadge Man" [...] was released, though the album's only single, [...] "Teenage Whore", {{did not receive}} a music video. The video is fairly {{abstract}} and a reflection of Hole's no wave influence at the time, with shots of Love and other band members in a car interspersed with shots of them performing <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> According to Love, she tracked down original rolls of radiographic medical film from Denver, Colorado, {{that had been used}} in the Vietnam War, which the music video was then shot on, giving the images an X-ray-like appearance. The video was shown on MTV's 120 Minutes in 1992 during an interview with Love and Kim Gordon, and was broadcast again on the show in 1994 and 1995 but was never as popular as the band's later videos. For the music video, an alternate mix of the song by Gordon was used to eliminate profanity.|$|E
500|$|No one professes to {{have seen}} Home carried from window to window. Home told the three men who were present {{that he was going}} to be wafted, and he thus set up a state of very nervous expectation... Both Lord Crawford and Lord Adare say that they were warned. Then Lord Crawford says that he saw the shadow on the wall of Home {{entering}} the room horizontally; and as the moon, by whose light he professes {{to have seen}} the shadow, was at the most only three days old, his testimony is absolutely worthless. Lord Adare claims only that he saw Home, in the dark, [...] "standing upright outside our window." [...] In the dark—it was an almost moonless December night—one could not, as a matter of fact, say very positively whether Home was outside or inside; but, in any case, he acknowledges that there was a nineteen-inch window-sill <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> and Home could stand on that.|$|E
500|$|Ronnie and Mildred (Gordon Peters and Barbara Ashcroft) – Ronnie and Mildred were a {{constantly}} cheerful, but incredibly boring, couple who provided yet another annoyance to the Meldrews, who dreaded any upcoming visits to them; Victor {{once said that}} he had hoped they were both dead. In [...] "The Worst Horror of All", when the couple attempted a surprise visit, the Meldrews hid in their house to give the impression they were away on holiday, and then took the phone off the hook for several days afterwards, though these efforts to avoid them were in vain. They are referenced a number of times in the series for giving the Meldrews bizarre and always unwanted presents that are seldom opened, usually involving a garish photograph of themselves. In the final series, however it was clear that their cheerfulness was a façade and, in a particularly dark scene, Mildred hanged herself [...] "during a game of Happy Families". The shot of Mildred's feet dangling <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> is usually cut from pre-watershed screenings.|$|E
