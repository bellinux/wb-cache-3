500|$|Classmates {{believed}} [...] "the plays {{were really}} morbid and grotesque." [...] Ian MacFarlane, Cho's former classmate, stated that, [...] "when we read Cho's plays, {{it was like}} something out of a nightmare. The plays had really twisted, macabre violence that used weapons I wouldn't have even thought of." [...] When Stephen Davis, a senior who was also in Cho's class, read Richard McBeef, he turned to his roommate and said, [...] "This is the kind <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> is going to walk into a classroom and start shooting people." [...] Anna Brown, another student in the class, sometimes joked with her friends that Cho was [...] "the kind <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> might go on a rampage killing." ...|$|E

Fishburne stated that he modeled his {{character}} after Ed Bradley, stating that [...] "my inspiration really is the late Ed Bradley, who was a CBS correspondent on 60 Minutes for many years ... legendary Ed Bradley... was a friend, a mentor, and {{a role model for}} me, particularly because he worked in journalism, and he was the kind <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> walked with kings, but he had the common touch. And so he was my inspiration for Perry." ...|$|E
500|$|Selman {{was pleased}} with the {{finished}} result of the episode. He noted in the interview with Grub Street that Marge starting to blog about food [...] "does not sound inherently exciting, but the episode itself is actually very exciting, and I'm super thrilled with the way it's turned out." [...] Selman thinks a strong thing about the episode is the fact that, despite Homer's love for food, Homer is not the one that becomes a foodie as one might expect. He explained that this is because although Homer loves eating, [...] "he's kind of a blue-collar kind <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> doesn't like foreign food, weird food, savoring food, intellectualizing food, blogging about it, photographing it – he just wants to be stuffed all the time." ...|$|E

500|$|Raymond {{took the}} war in Europe seriously enough to {{incorporate}} it into his strips, with Flash returning to Earth in the Spring of 1941. Jungle Jim found himself {{involved in the conflict}} too, fighting in the U.S. Army. Raymond was becoming [...] "restive about doing his duty", a restlessness increased by the knowledge that four of his five brothers were already enlisted. [...] In February 1944, Raymond left King Features and his work on the Sunday Flash Gordon/Jungle Jim pages to join the US Marines, commissioned as a captain and serving in the public-relations arm. Raymond is quoted as stating [...] "I just had to get into this fight... I've always been the kind <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> gets a lump in his throat when a band plays the 'Star Spangled Banner'".|$|E
500|$|The story {{developed}} from the character of Mark, who {{is based on the}} first boyfriend of Duncan's oldest daughter. Duncan says he [...] "was a very sick young man, and he was the most charming young man you could ever meet" [...] but that it [...] "wasn't until things got very bad that we discovered he was the kind <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> would swerve in the road to run over a dog." [...] She began to wonder what might happen if a charismatic teenage psychopath was placed in a high school setting and the young people he would attract as followers. 'Then I thought [...] "What could he make them do?" [...] The book moved from there.' Mr. Griffin was based on the personality of a drama teacher one of Duncan's daughters had in high school who [...] "was very strict and demanded that her students do the best work they were capable of doing", but for whom Duncan's daughter was later grateful. Duncan wanted the character to be symbolic of a teacher who is not appreciated at the time, but later is.|$|E
500|$|Dufek {{was drafted}} by the Seahawks with the second {{selection}} of fifth round and 126th overall selection of the 1976 NFL Draft. [...] Dufek {{was one of the}} original Seahawks in 1976, the franchise's first year in the NFL, and he played for them until 1984.

[...] Over the course of his career he had three interceptions, two quarterback sacks, a fumble recovery and thirteen kickoff returns. [...] Sportswriter Richard Kucner once wrote: [...] "Don Dufek was the kind <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> just won't take 'No' for an answer. He was released in training camp four times during his eight-year Seahawks career. But each time, Seattle had a change of heart, bringing him back.

500|$|The Capitals did {{not give}} Hunter his first NHL win until his third game, a 3–2 win over the Ottawa Senators that broke a four-game losing streak. Brooks Laich scored the game-winning goal just 12 seconds into the {{overtime}} period. The goal {{would prove to be}} the fastest overtime goal scored during the 2011–12 NHL regular season. In the rematch four days later, Ovechkin appeared to spear Senators forward Chris Neil. Following a Neil hit on Ovechkin, the pair skated up the ice, whereupon Neil fell to the ice following the alleged spear. Neil was given an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for diving. A spearing penalty, if called, would have resulted in a five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct. Later in the game, Ovechkin scored the eventual game-winning goal, his first goal in six games. When asked about the incident after the game, Neil described it as a [...] "pitchfork in the gut," [...] while Ovechkin stated he was [...] "not the type <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> spears players." [...] The following day, a league spokesman stated that Ovechkin would not be suspended or fined for the incident.|$|E

Global BC penned Cane as [...] "mysterious". SoapNet described Cane as a [...] "pretty stand-up guy", as well as [...] "loyal and dedicated to the people he cares about". The network said his time in Genoa City has [...] "made him a good man". In an interview with On-Air On-Soaps, Goddard said that Cane working at Jabot Cosmetics is [...] "very enthusiastic and cautious about falling into a family business which is an Abbott company", {{and that he is}} [...] "very sensitive about that". He also stated that Cane [...] "has no fears in doing business with anybody" [...] because if you can come from a [...] "family of gangsters than business people don’t really measure up". Looking back on Cane's [...] "power jobs", Goddard stated: [...] "I don’t think Cane has the book learning skills side of it, but I think he has the life lessons side of it, based on who he is and where he has come from. The way he does business with people, he kind of understands who they are as people." ...|$|E

2500|$|Each of {{the three}} fighters have their own unique characteristics, with Guy being the fastest {{of the three}} due to his ninjutsu skills. One of his most novel {{techniques}} in the game is the [...] "Off-the-Wall Kick" [...] which allows Guy to bounce off the wall with a jump kick. Due to space constraint, Guy was initially omitted from the SNES port of the game, with Cody and Haggar being the only playable characters in that version. Capcom later produced a second SNES version titled Final Fight Guy, which replaced Cody's character with that <b>of</b> <b>Guy</b> (<b>who</b> is the only character featured in the game's cover art). Later versions of the game such as Final Fight CD for Sega CD and Final Fight One for the Game Boy Advance would include all three characters.
