5|$|The {{watershed}} can {{be divided}} into two hydrologic areas with different infiltration rates. The northern area, comprising about 40percent of the watershed, consists of the Portland Terraces, and the southern consists of the Boring Hills and the Kelso Slope. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> that falls on the northern area percolates into the ground, and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> that falls on the southern area runs quickly into the creek or its tributaries. Rain that falls on the north generally has a more gradual, longer-lasting effect, sustaining the base flow of the creek during dry periods.|$|E

This rainfall smashed all-time rainfall records in a 24-hour period (most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> {{fell in a}} 6 to 8hour-period). Ottawa's O-Train Trillium Line was halted because of a landslide that obstructed the railroad corridor. Several major roads in Gatineau and Ottawa were under several inches of water, locally chest-high. More than $45million (2004 CAD; $41million USD) in insured damage was reported in Ontario.|$|E
5|$|The {{ceremonial}} {{centre of}} the Maya city was where the ruling elite lived, and where the administrative functions of the city were performed, together with religious ceremonies. It was also where {{the inhabitants of the}} city gathered for public activities.

5|$|A {{squall line}} (also {{known as a}} quasi-linear {{convective}} system or QLCS) is a line of thunderstorms forming along or ahead of a cold front. In the early 20th century, the term {{was used as a}} synonym for cold front. It contains heavy precipitation, hail, frequent lightning, strong straight-line winds, and possibly tornadoes and waterspouts. Strong straight-line winds can occur where the squall line is {{in the shape of a}} bow echo. Tornadoes can occur along waves within a line echo wave pattern (LEWP), where mesoscale low-pressure areas are present. Some bow echoes which develop within the summer season are known as derechos, and they move quite fast through large sections of territory. On the back edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> shield associated with mature squall lines, a wake low can be present, sometimes associated with a heat burst.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Gonzalo de Alvarado and his {{soldiers}} pushed south to meet Chávez. They were already exhausted from their previous expeditions; {{both men and}} horses were in poor shape, and supplies were a constant worry. Their progress was further hindered by the onset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> season, and the constant resistance of hostile natives. After three or four months, Gonzalo de Alvarado arrived at Lepaera, where they were expecting to find Chávez and his men. Unable to locate them, Alvarado sent out his lieutenant Xuárez de Ávila to scout the surrounding area. At length he returned with news that Chávez, faced {{with the threat of}} mutiny by his men, had marched back to Guatemala. Since Pedro de Alvarado had already left for Spain, this left Gonzalo as the highest-ranking Spanish officer in Honduras-Higueras.|$|E
5|$|The northwestern {{slope of}} Kohala has few stream valleys cut into it, the result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> shadow effect, as the {{dominant}} trade winds bring most of the rainfall to the northeastern slope of the volcano. The seven windward valleys of Kohala are, from southeast to northwest, Waipio, Waimanu, Honopue, Honokea, Honokane Iki, Honokane Nui, and Pololu. The size of the valleys reflects the amount of drainage {{they have been able}} to capture; Waipio, the largest, at some point drained Waimanu Valley as well, and the former headwaters of Waimanu are now one of its branches. Waimanu valley, cut off from its headwaters to the summit and left with Wai'ilikahi as its main tributary, still had managed to form a substantial floodplain, although less than half the size of Waipio. Honokane Nui, the third largest valley, has its drainage almost exclusively from the north side of the summit, and as a result is a deep, long, narrow bottomed valley with little habitable floodplain.|$|E
5|$|The prefecture-level city roughly {{corresponds}} to the basin of the Lhasa River, a major tributary of the Yarlung Tsangpo River. It lies on the Lhasa terrane, the last unit of crust to accrete to the Eurasian plate before the continent of India collided with Asia about 50 million years ago and pushed up the Himalayas. The terrane is high, contains a complex pattern of faults and is tectonically active. The temperature is generally warm in summer and rises above freezing on sunny days in winter. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> falls in summer. The upland areas and northern grasslands are used for grazing yaks, sheep and goats, while the river valleys support agriculture with crops such as barley, wheat and vegetables. Wildlife is not abundant, but includes the rare snow leopard and black-necked crane. Mining has caused some environmental problems.|$|E

Spears, determined to be self-sufficient and unaffected by media comments, then makes {{a phone call to}} her bodyguard, and using a cloth to disguise the sound of her voice, coaxes him to leave the area so that her group may sneak out of the hotel and enjoy the day. They run into an elevator and fool around briefly with the security cameras before going up to the main lobby. A strut down the lobby of the hotel and a short dance sequence follows. As they leave the hotel, they follow towards the dance club. However, before they arrive, they're caught in an alley by several paparazzi, and start to perform a dance routine in the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain.</b> As they make their entrance, they're dripping wet, an image which makes for more sensationalist fodder for the tabloid reporter.|$|E
5|$|Uttar Pradesh has a humid {{subtropical}} climate and experiences four seasons. The winter in January and February {{is followed by}} summer between March and May and the monsoon season between June and September. Summers are extreme with temperatures fluctuating anywhere between 0°C and 50°C {{in parts of the}} state. The Gangetic plain varies from semiarid to sub-humid. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 650mm in the southwest corner of the state to 1000mm in the eastern and southeastern parts of the state. Primarily a summer phenomenon, the Bay of Bengal branch of the Indian monsoon is the major bearer of rain in most parts of state. It is the south-west monsoon which brings most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> here, although rain due to the western disturbances and north-east monsoon also contribute small quantities towards the overall precipitation of the state.|$|E
5|$|Andrei and Daniil {{are working}} on the {{decoration}} of a church in Vladimir. Although they have been there for several months the walls are still white and bare as Andrei is doubting himself. A messenger arrives with word from the furious Bishop to say they have until the Autumn to finish the job. On a nearby road {{in the middle of a}} field of flowers Andrei confides to Daniil that the task disgusts him and that he is unable to paint a subject such as the Last Judgement as he doesn’t want to terrify people into submission. He comes to the conclusion that he has lost the ease of mind that an artist needs for his work. Foma, impatient and ambitious, resigns and leaves Andrei's group to take up the offer of painting a smaller, less prestigious, church. Stone carvers and decorators of Andrei's party have also been working on the Grand Prince's mansion. The Prince wants the work to be done again more in line with his tastes but the workers already have another job, at the mansion of the Grand Prince's brother, and refuse. On a path through the woods soldiers accost the artisans on the orders of the Grand Prince and gouge their eyes out, so that they cannot replicate their work. Back at the church Andrei is dismayed by the news of their fate and angrily throws paint and smears it on one of the walls. Sergei (Vladimir Titov) one of the young apprentices who escaped the attack unharmed reads a random section of the bible aloud, at Daniil's request, concerning women. Durochka (Irma Raush) (whose name identifies her as a holy fool or Yurodivy), wanders in out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> and is upset by the sight of the paint on the wall. Her feeble-mindedness and innocence leads Andrei to the idea to paint a feast.|$|E

5|$|On September1, the Venezuelan tanker Acosta relayed an SOS signal while {{near the}} {{hurricane}} 200mi (320km) {{southeast of the}} Frying Pan Shoals. United States Coast Guard stations in Norfolk, Virginia and Morehead City, North Carolina dispatched cutters to aid the ship. Off of the East Coast, {{an offshoot of the}} hurricane resulted in the drownings of two people. In the Mid-Atlantic states, the passing hurricane's outflow interacted with a cold front that had become quasi-stationary over the area. The cyclone's flow pattern enhanced the moisture environment over the region, resulting in locally heavy rainfall, particularly in New Jersey, where precipitation peaked at 24in (610mm) in Ewan in a nine-hour period on September1. This would make the hurricane the wettest tropical cyclone in state history. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> was in western portions of the state, however, with minimal rainfall at the coast. The floods caused small rivers to overflow, breaching dams. An overflowed creek inundated parts of Lumberton Township, rendering 2,000people homeless. Rail service between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and areas of southern New Jersey was suspended as a result of washed out tracks. Resulting damage to infrastructure totaled $4,000,000in the southwestern quarter of New Jersey alone. Damage to roads in Burlington County amounted to $2,500,000. In Camden County, damage was estimated at $1million. Four fatalities were reported {{as a result of the}} floods. In Delaware, rainfall was comparatively less. However, rough seas generated by the hurricane offshore caused $50,000 in damages and one death. Further north, strong gusts were reported across New England. Winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) were recorded by a weather station in Nantucket. Peak winds in Massachusetts were estimated at 65 mph (100 km/h). In Eastport, Maine, winds of 45 mph (70 km/h) were reported.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} resumed on lap 13 and Button, who had changed to {{intermediate}} tyres before the safety car period, {{was given a}} drive-through penalty for speeding behind the safety car, emerging in 15th place. Vettel began to enlarge his lead over Alonso and Massa in second and third. Alonso and the Mercedes pitted for intermediate tyres, leaving Massa in second and Kobayashi in third by lap 17. Barrichello, who switched for intermediates as the safety car came in, began setting times at the same pace as the leaders, and gained 15th position as the drivers in front changed tyres. On lap 19, a rain storm arrived at the circuit, forcing the drivers on intermediate tyres to switch back to full wets. Alonso and Button, who were in fifth and eighth respectively, fell to ninth and eleventh, while the drivers on the full wet tyres began pitting for fresh wet tyres. The safety car was brought out on lap 20 due to the intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain,</b> and Vettel, Webber, Massa and Buemi, who had not changed tyres, went to the pitlane for fresh full wets. After six laps under the safety car, the conditions were getting worse, and the race was suspended.|$|E
