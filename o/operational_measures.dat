25|$|The Swiss {{producer}} of both onboard clocktypes SpectraTime declined to comment. According to ESA they concluded with their industrial partners for the rubidium atomic clocks some implemented testing and <b>operational</b> <b>measures</b> were required.

China and India use the same SpectraTime-built atomic clocks in their satellite navigation systems. ESA has contacted the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) who initially reported not having experienced similar failures. However, at the end of January 2017, Indian news outlets reported that all three clocks aboard the IRNSS-1A satellite (launched in July 2013 with a 10-year life expectancy) had failed and that a replacement satellite would be launched in the second half of 2017.|$|E

We propose an operational definition of homebound status, and we measure its validity for community-dwelling elderly in the Massachusetts Health Care Panel Study (MHCPS). The MHCPS is a longitudinal study of a cohort of elderly persons (N = 1, 625), which began in 1974, with follow-up surveys in 1976, 1980, and 1985. Validity was measured by comparing responses from the <b>operational</b> <b>measure</b> to persons' responses to questions that we judged should {{be associated with a}} valid measure of homebound status. This construct validity method resulted in correlations that were significant and in the expected direction, and that suggested that this <b>operational</b> <b>measure</b> is a highly specific, moderately sensitive, valid measure. These results underscore the need for researchers investigating the homebound to discuss the validity and limitations of their homebound measures, and in what context these measures are useful...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{emphasis}} placed on physicians’ lifelong learning, no psychometrically sound instrument has been developed to provide an <b>operational</b> <b>measure</b> of the concept and its components among physicians. The authors designed this study to develop a tool for measuring physician lifelong learning, to identify its underlying components and to assess its psychometric properties. A 37 -item questionnaire was developed, based on a review of literature {{and the results of}} two pilot studies. Psychometric analyses of the responses of 160 physicians identified 19 items that were included in the Jefferson Scale of Physician Lifelong Learning. Factor analysis of the 19 items showed five meaningful factors that were consistent with the definition and major features of lifelong learning. They were ‘need recognition’, ‘research endeavor’, ‘self-initiation’, ‘technical skills’ and ‘personal motivation’. The method of contrasted groups provided evidence in support of the validity of the five factors. The factors’ reliability was assessed by coefficient alpha. It is concluded that lifelong learning is a multifaceted concept, and its <b>operational</b> <b>measure</b> is feasible for evaluating different educational programs and for studying group differences among physicians...|$|R

The paper introduces the generalized options' implied measure of riskiness {{based on the}} risk-neutral return distribution of financial securities.

The empirical {{results indicate that the}} generalized measure of riskiness is able to rank equity portfolios based on their expected returns per unit of risk and hence yields a more efficient strategy for maximizing expected return of the portfolio while minimizing its risk.
