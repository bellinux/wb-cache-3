5|$|Beset {{by early}} {{construction}} problems, the first FSD aircraft {{was transferred to}} Groom Lake in May1981 inside a C-5. Further problems, this time with fuel leaks, delayed the first flight. Under the control of Harold Farley, the aircraft took off on 18June for its maiden flight, nine months after the July1980 first flight originally envisaged. The first production F-117A was delivered in 1982, and <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> was achieved in October1983; the 59th and last F-117 was delivered in 1990.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, Russia, for {{the first}} time in combat conditions, {{deployed}} four Su-35S planes to Khmeimim air base in Syria as part of Russian air operations in the country. This occurred following an increase in tension between Russia and Turkey as a result of reported incursions by Russian aircraft into Turkish airspace. The aircraft complemented the Su-30SMs in flying combat air patrols and providing protection to other aircraft that were conducting bombing missions. As a result of operations in Syria, problems were identified with the aircraft's avionics and were subsequently rectified. The aircraft presumably attained full <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> in September 2017.|$|E

To further our understanding of service operations alignment, we apply a unique combination of experimental scenarios and discrete choice modeling to measure the role of managers in orchestrating <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Using the third-party logistics tender review and bid preparation process as an empirical setting, we reveal the resource allocation choices that managers make between six distinctive <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities</b> (customer engagement, cross-functional coordination, creative solutions, operations improvement, IT infrastructure and professional delivery) and show the subtle ways in which these capabilities interact as the service context moves from one based on commoditization to one based on customization...|$|R

5|$|Proposals were {{submitted}} by Boeing, General Dynamics and North American Rockwell in January 1970. In June 1970, North American Rockwell's design was selected and {{was awarded a}} development contract. The original program called for two test airframes, five flyable aircraft, and 40 engines. This was cut in 1971 to one ground and three flight test aircraft. The company {{changed its name to}} Rockwell International and named its aircraft division North American Aircraft Operations in 1973. A fourth prototype, built to production standards, was ordered in the fiscal year 1976 budget. Plans called for 240 B-1As to be built, with initial <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> set for 1979.|$|E
5|$|In December 2005, the USAF {{announced}} that the F-22 had achieved Initial <b>Operational</b> <b>Capability</b> (IOC). During Exercise Northern Edge in Alaska in June 2006, in simulated combat exercises 12 F-22s of the 94th FS downed 108 adversaries with no losses. In the exercises, the Raptor-led Blue Force amassed 241 kills against two losses in air-to-air combat, with neither loss being an F-22. During Red Flag 07-1 in February 2007, 14 F-22s of the 94th FS supported Blue Force strikes and undertook close air support sorties. Against superior numbers of Red Force Aggressor F-15s and F-16s, 6–8 F-22s maintained air dominance throughout. No sorties were missed because of maintenance or other failures; a single F-22 was judged lost against the defeated opposing force. F-22s also provided airborne electronic surveillance.|$|E
5|$|The Radar System Improvement Program (RSIP) was a joint US/NATO {{development}} program. RSIP {{enhances the}} <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> of the E-3 radars' electronic countermeasures, and dramatically improve the system's reliability, maintainability, and availability. Essentially, this program replaced the older transistor-transistor logic (TTL) and emitter-coupled logic (MECL) electronic components, long-since out of production, with off-the-shelf digital computers that utilised a High-level programming language instead of assembly language. Significant improvement came from adding pulse compression to the pulse-Doppler mode, replacing the old 8-bit FFT with 24-bit FFTs, and the 12-bit A/D (Sign + 12-bits) with a 15-bit A/D (Sign + 15-bits). These {{hardware and software}} modifications improve the E-3 radars' performance, providing enhanced detection with an emphasis towards low radar cross-section (RCS) targets.|$|E
40|$|Professional Doctorate - Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) In a {{fast-changing}} {{and volatile}} business world, firms draw on dynamic capabilities to create, extend and modify their resources and capabilities {{in order to}} enhance their competitive position. Cross-cultural acquisitions are one of the corporate strategies for firms to grow across borders and to gain access to new bases of knowledge and capabilities. Management desires to integrate the best practices from both firms after acquisition. Best practices are considered to be the best <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities</b> in various organizational functions to operate a firm effectively and efficiently. <b>Operational</b> <b>capabilities</b> draw on organizational routines that embody knowledge. Through sensing opportunities, seizing identified opportunities and reconfiguring resources and capabilities, firms can systematically integrate best practices in <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities</b> from the acquiring and acquired firms. Knowledge sharing {{within the context of the}} three dynamic capabilities processes affects the knowledge-based routines that make up <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Hence, knowledge sharing is embedded in the three dynamic capabilities processes that enable the integration of best practices in <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities.</b> There are intensive interpersonal interactions during the knowledge sharing process. In a cross-cultural context, culture plays an important role in knowledge sharing and hence affects best <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities</b> integration. This dissertation endeavors to explore how and when culture makes a difference to the efficiency and effectiveness of knowledge sharing, a change which is visible in altered <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities,</b> during the sensing, seizing and reconfiguring processes. The qualitative case study approach supports this empirical research by obtaining rich contextual data and insightful information from interviewees to better understand the cross-cultural micro-foundations underlying knowledge sharing for the integration of best practices in <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Three cross-cultural acquisition cases of one multi-national corporation were purposefully selected to reflect certain features of different types of acquisitions. The empirical findings from this research show that different cultural dimensions exert different impacts with different degrees of strength on the efficiency and effectiveness of the knowledge sharing during the sensing, seizing and reconfiguring processes. This in turn affects the integration of best practices in <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities.</b> This empirical research contributes practical insights. In particular, it suggests the introduction of structured processes to facilitate knowledge sharing for integration of best practices systematically; such structured processes should account for different cultural dimensions affecting knowledge sharing in different processes in cross-cultural acquisitions. On a scholarly level, this study opens up future research opportunities with new perspectives on the duality of ostensive and performative dynamic capabilities...|$|R

5|$|The Westland Apache {{experienced}} {{delays in}} entering service due to complications with the modifications made for British service. Prior to the Apache entering service in 2004, several development problems were noted, including {{a lack of}} the ability to securely communicate with other helicopters and a risk of damage to the tail rotor and airframe from firing its Hellfire missiles. The problem with using the Hellfire was debris generated by the firing of missiles, both the Hellfire and CRV7 rockets, could strike the body of the aircraft and cause damage; resolving this issue created a delay to training programmes. These problems were corrected prior to entering service, a secure communications suite was installed and Hellfire missiles are routinely fired by Apaches. In 2002, government sources stated that full <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> was set to be achieved by 2010.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Australian {{government}} decided to retire the F-111s by 2010, and acquire 24 Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornets as an interim replacement, pending {{the arrival of}} the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning then being developed. The F-111 fleet was considered to be at risk due to fatigue, and too expensive to operate as each aircraft required 180 hours of maintenance for every hour of flying time. No.1 Squadron ceased operating the F-111 in January 2009, in preparation for converting to the Super Hornet. Former F-111 aircrew, familiar with side-by-side seating and a different performance envelope, found conversion more challenging than pilots experienced in the RAAF's McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet fighters, which shared many characteristics with the newer model. No.1 Squadron re-equipped between 26March 2010 and 21October 2011, making it the first Australian unit, and the first squadron outside the United States, to fly the Super Hornet. It became operational with its new aircraft on 8December 2011. The multi-role Super Hornet allowed No.1 Squadron to augment its previous offensive strike role with an air-to-air combat function. The RAAF attained full <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> with the Super Hornet in December 2012.|$|E
5|$|Some {{authors have}} stated that heavy losses in {{carriers}} and veteran aircrews at Midway permanently weakened the Imperial Japanese Navy. Parshall and Tully {{have stated that}} the heavy losses in veteran aircrew (110, just under 25% of the aircrew embarked on the four carriers) were not crippling to the Japanese naval air corps as a whole; the Japanese navy had 2,000 carrier-qualified aircrew {{at the start of}} the Pacific war. The loss of four large fleet carriers and over 40% of the carriers' highly trained aircraft mechanics and technicians, plus the essential flight-deck crews and armorers, and the loss of organizational knowledge embodied in such highly trained crews, were still heavy blows to the Japanese carrier fleet. A few months after Midway, the JNAF sustained similar casualty rates in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons and Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, and it was these battles, combined with the constant attrition of veterans during the Solomons campaign, which were the catalyst for the sharp downward spiral in <b>operational</b> <b>capability.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Special Air Service Regiment {{owes its}} {{heritage}} to the RAR. Originally formed as the 1st SAS Company in 1957, in 1960 {{it became an}} independent company of the RAR and was tasked with providing the army's special operations capability. The SASR became a regiment {{in its own right}} on 20 August 1964, severing the link with the RAR at this time. Re-raised as a commando battalion from 1997, 4 RAR (Commando) served in East Timor as a conventional light-role battalion in 2001, before focusing on the development of its special operations capability. In this role the battalion was designed to be a flexible, self-contained force element able to deploy at short notice to undertake offensive operations in support of Australia's national interests. Once full <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> was reached, elements of 4 RAR (Commando) would serve in Timor Leste, Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as providing a domestic counter terrorism capability as part of Tactical Assault Group (East). In 2009, 4 RAR (Commando) was renamed the 2nd Commando Regiment, and as such is no longer part of the RAR. Rather than being formally disbanded, 4 RAR remained on the Army's order of battle with its colours and traditions maintained and protected, ready to be re-raised in the future if required.|$|E

40|$|What {{operational}} {{factors can}} explain the performance differences between manufacturing firms? Scholars have produced a significant volume of research that examines the linkages between operational factors (resources and practices) and firm performance. There is agreement that organizational capabilities mediate the relationship between operational factors and firm performance. However, due to the numerous and sometimes contradictory definitions of organizational capabilities in the literature and because organizational capabilities includes non-operational factors, {{it has been suggested}} that <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities,</b> as a sub construct of organizational capabilities, is more appropriate for establishing an empirical relationship between operational factors and firm performance. Scholars have argued that process improvement practices facilitate the development of <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities,</b> which can consequently lead to improved firm performance. Other scholars have argued that process improvement practices facilitate organizational knowledge creation, which can also influence firm performance. We integrate these two theoretical perspectives into a single conceptual model that better explains the relationship between knowledge-creating practices and firm operational performance. Specifically, we argue that knowledge-creating practices play a significant role in developing a firm’s <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities,</b> which in turn, influence firm operational performance. This research investigates the existence of a relationship between organizational knowledge creation and firm operational performance that is mediated by <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities...</b>|$|R
