5|$|Prior to the {{dominance}} of the Gelug sect <b>of</b> <b>Buddhism</b> in Tawang, the Nyingmapa or the Black Hat sect <b>of</b> <b>Buddhism</b> was dominant and this resulted in their hegemony and even hostile approach towards the founder, Merek Lama. This problem was compounded by the Drukpas of Bhutan, who also belonged to the Nyingmapa sect, who even tried to invade and take control of Tawang. Hence, when the Tawang monastery was built like a fort structure, a strategic location was chosen from the defense point of view.|$|E

5|$|The Konjaku Monogatarishū from ca. 1120 is {{the most}} {{important}} setsuwa compilation. It is an anonymous collection of more than 1,000 anecdotes or tales. About two-thirds of the tales are Buddhist, telling about the spread <b>of</b> <b>Buddhism</b> from India via China to Japan. As such it is the first world history <b>of</b> <b>Buddhism</b> written in Japanese. This National Treasure is also known as the Suzuka Manuscript and consists of nine volumes covering setsuwa from India (vols. 2 and 5), China (vols. 7, 9, 10) and Japan (vols. 12, 17, 27, 29).

5|$|Besides meditation, Luang Pu Sodh {{promoted}} the study <b>of</b> <b>Buddhism</b> as well. In this combination {{he was one}} of the pioneers in Thai Buddhism. In 1939, Luang Pu Sodh set up a Pali Institute at Wat Paknam, which is said to have cost 2.5 million baht. Luang Pu Sodh financed the building through the production of amulets, which is common in Thai Buddhism. The kitchen which he built was the fulfillment of an intention which he had since his first years at Wat Pho, when he experienced difficulty in finding food. It also resulted in monks having more time to study the Dhamma.|$|E

5|$|The Jokhang {{was founded}} {{during the reign}} of King Songtsen Gampo. According to tradition, the temple was built for the king's two brides: Princess Wencheng of the Chinese Tang dynasty and Princess Bhrikuti of Nepal. Both are said to have brought {{important}} Buddhist statues and images from China and Nepal to Tibet, which were housed here, as part of their dowries. The oldest part of the temple was built in 652. Over the next 900 years, the temple was enlarged several times with the last renovation done in 1610 by the Fifth Dalai Lama. Following the death of Gampo, the image in Ramcho Lake temple was moved to the Jokhang temple for security reasons. When King Tresang Detsan ruled from 755 to 797, the Buddha image of the Jokhang temple was hidden, as the king's minister was hostile to the spread <b>of</b> <b>Buddhism</b> in Tibet. During the late ninth and early tenth centuries, the Jokhang and Ramoche temples were said to have been used as stables. In 1049 Atisha, a renowned teacher <b>of</b> <b>Buddhism</b> from Bengal taught in Jokhang.|$|E
5|$|The Konjaku Monogatarishū, a {{collection}} of stories published in the late Heian period, contains {{some of the earliest}} tales of tengu, already characterized as they would be for centuries to come. These tengu are the troublesome opponents <b>of</b> <b>Buddhism,</b> who mislead the pious with false images of the Buddha, carry off monks and drop them in remote places, possess women in an attempt to seduce holy men, rob temples, and endow those who worship them with unholy power. They often disguise themselves as priests or nuns, but their true form seems to be that of a kite.|$|E

A gradual increase in the size of buildings led to standard units of measurement as well as refinements in layout and garden design.

5|$|A {{number of}} new sects {{appeared}} in Japan in the 12th and 13th centuries as a natural reaction to the difficult teachings of older schools and partially motivated by the notion of mappō. Growing out of an Amida cult, the Jōdo Shinshū Pure Land school was founded in 1224 by Shinran, and attracted a following from all classes and occupations. Three years later, Dōgen introduced the Sōtō school of Zen Buddhism emphasizing meditation and dharma practice. The first truly Japanese school <b>of</b> <b>Buddhism</b> goes back to Nichiren's proclamation of his teachings in 1253. Nichiren Buddhism was exceptional for being militant and intolerant. The central focus of Nichiren's teaching was the veneration of the Lotus Sutra.|$|E
