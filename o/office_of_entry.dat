50|$|After the September 11 {{attacks of}} 2001, the Department of Homeland Security created two {{immigration}} enforcement agencies {{out of the}} defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). ICE was tasked with investigations, detention and removal of illegal aliens, and interior enforcement. CBP was tasked with inspections at U.S. ports <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> and with preventing illegal entries between the port <b>of</b> <b>entry,</b> transportation check, and entries on U.S. coastal borders. DHS management decided to align the Border Patrol with CBP. CBP's <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Field Operations is solely responsible for the nation's ports <b>of</b> <b>entry,</b> while Border Patrol maintains jurisdiction over all locations between ports <b>of</b> <b>entry,</b> giving Border Patrol agents federal arrest authority nationwide.|$|R

50|$|Hikers {{starting}} in Canada and {{crossing the border}} must report to Customs and Border Protection, <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Field Operations Officers assigned to the Goat Haunt Port <b>of</b> <b>Entry.</b> For a period after the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Goat Haunt border crossing was closed to prevent the possibility of terrorists using the border crossing to enter the United States. Unfortunately, this prevented legitimate visitors from crossing the border and caused concern for U.S. authorities. To make this possible, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Field Operations began staffing the Goat Haunt Port <b>of</b> <b>Entry.</b> Other familiar law enforcement agencies in the area include U.S. Border Patrol Agents and National Park Service LE Rangers, conducting patrols of the trails in the areas around Goat Haunt.|$|R

40|$|Lebanon {{has had an}} {{ambiguous}} approach {{to the more than}} one million Syrians seeking protection in the country since 2011. The country is neither party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, nor does it have any national legislation dealing with refugees. In October 2014, Lebanon’s Council of Ministers adopted the first comprehensive policy on Syrian displacement, one explicit goal of which is to decrease the number of Syrians in Lebanon by reducing access to territory and encouraging return to Syria. This ambition is currently being implemented through the December 2014 General Security <b>Office</b> new set <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> requirements for Syrians and new rules for Syrian nationals already in Lebanon applying for and renewing their residency permits. Building on 10 months of fieldwork in Lebanon, this article explores the legal status of Syrian refugees in Lebanon in light of the recent regulatory changes. It argues that these leave many refugees in a deeply precarious legal position, with an overwhelming majority of Syrian refugees present in Lebanon without legal status. In essence, this article argues that Syrians in Lebanon are left with two options: they either leave the country or stay and accept exploitation...|$|R
50|$|The {{responsibility}} of issuing Form I-94 {{is with the}} CBP <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Field Operations (OFO), a subdivision of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), that processes entries and exits at ports <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> (land, sea, and air) as well as deferred inspection sites. Note that OFO is distinct from the United States Border Patrol, whose responsibility is to patrol {{the rest of the}} border to monitor for unauthorized border-crossing.|$|R
5000|$|Withdrawal of {{application}} for admission applies only to Arriving Aliens who present themselves for admission at a port <b>of</b> <b>entry,</b> whereas voluntary return applies to people apprehended or stopped at a land border. In particular, the offices within CBP that handle these are different: withdrawal {{of application}} for admission is handled by the CBP <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Field Operations whereas voluntary returns are handled by United States Border Patrol.|$|R
50|$|Deferred {{inspection}} is {{a procedure}} in immigration enforcement in the United States for Arriving Aliens. Here, {{the final decision}} on whether to admit the Arriving Alien, instead of being conducted at the port <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> where the alien arrived, is deferred to be carried out later at a deferred inspection site, while the alien is paroled into the United States. The guidelines followed at the deferred inspection site are largely the same as those followed by the officers at the port <b>of</b> <b>entry,</b> and are described in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Inspector's Field Manual. Aliens do not accrue unlawful presence between the time of arrival and the date of deferred inspection, but they do begin to accrue unlawful presence after their parole ends, if they are not successfully admitted at the deferred inspection site by then. Note that the officers at both the port <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> and the deferred inspection site are part <b>of</b> the CBP <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Field Operations.|$|R
50|$|U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is {{composed}} of three distinct enforcement arms: the <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Border Patrol (OBP, otherwise known as the United States Border Patrol), the <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Field Operations (OFO; commonly called by its former name 'Customs') and the <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Air and Marine (OAM). OBP is tasked with securing the international border in-between the Ports <b>of</b> <b>Entry</b> (POE) and is a mobile enforcement agency that is structured and employed like any other uniformed police department in the United States. OFO is the federal law enforcement branch tasked with administering the POE's (air, land or sea) and is responsible for determining the admissibility of all persons and goods into the United States. The OAM operates all aircraft and watercraft for CBP and coordinates their interdiction efforts with either OBP, U.S. Coast Guard and/or with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the assistance was to strengthen the plant quarantine capabilities to a fully operational level. A total of five consultants were utilized in plant quarantine; plant pathology; entomology and legislation. The needs of the plant quarantine service were assessed; the technical and legal aspects of the legislation were reviewed; a two week training course was provided and three study tours for senior officers were undertaken. The project provided inspection and treatment equipment for the new plant quarantine laboratory and <b>offices</b> at points <b>of</b> <b>entry.</b> In addition, a draft list of quarantine pests was drafted and pest surveys were carried out. Furthermore, a public awareness programme in plant quarantine was initiated. As {{a result of these}} activities, the plant quarantine service of Malta has been significantly upgraded. However, in order to ensure continual benefits from the assistance received, the recommendations of the project must be implemented without delay. Particular emphasis should be placed on the enactment of the draft Plant Quarantine Act and Regulations, the establishment of the proposed Plant Protection Board, and the creation of the position of Plant Quarantine Officer in the Plant Health Division to direct the plant quarantine service. In addition, pest surveys should be regularly conducted and staff training maintained. Facilities, especially the shed in Marsa, need to be renovated...|$|R
