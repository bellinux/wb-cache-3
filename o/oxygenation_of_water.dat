Outdoor ponds have similar care requirement as indoor tanks with some notable exceptions such as amount of sunlight, natural and artificial environment pollution (i.e. dead leaves, debris, runoff), algae, selection of pond mates (i.e. algae eaters, frogs, etc.). Outdoor ponds tend to become miniature aquatic ecosystems, attracting various animals and plants (see water gardens for more information). In hot climates, {{it is important that}} pond temperatures do not rise to dangerously high levels which will kill the fish. In the winter, fish may become sluggish and stop feeding. This does not mean they are sick, but rather that their metabolism has slowed. The pond must not freeze solid and there should be an open spot in the surface ice to allow <b>oxygenation</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> The ice should also not be struck, as this sends shock waves of sound pressure through the water scaring the fish.|$|E

The classical approach to improvements – decreasing {{the size of the}} aerator exits - have already reached their limits. A recent new idea is to decrease the size of the generated air bubbles by oscillating the supplied air flow using fluidic oscillators. Authors made extensive performance measurements with an unusual high-frequency fluidic oscillator, designed to operate within the submersed aerator body. The performance was evaluated by the dynamic method of recording the oxygen concentration increase to saturation in the aerated water. Experiments proved the fluidic generator can demonstrably increase the aeration efficiency 4. 22 -times compared with the aeration from a plain end of a submerged air supply tube. Despite this significant improvement, the behaviour of the generator still provides an opportunity for further improvements...|$|E
40|$|Molecular oxygen (O 2) {{began to}} {{accumulate}} {{in the atmosphere}} and surface ocean ca. 2, 400 million years ago (Ma), but the persistent <b>oxygenation</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> masses throughout the oceans developed much later, perhaps beginning as recently as 580 – 550 Ma. For much of the intervening interval, moderately oxic surface waters lay above an oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) that tended toward euxinia (anoxic and sulfidic). Here we illustrate how contributions to primary production by anoxygenic photoautotrophs (including physiologically versatile cyanobacteria) influenced biogeochemical cycling during Earth's middle age, helping to perpetuate our planet's intermediate redox state by tempering O 2 production. Specifically, the ability to generate organic matter (OM) using sulfide as an electron donor enabled a positive biogeochemical feedback that sustained euxinia in the OMZ. On a geologic time scale, pyrite precipitation and burial governed a second feedback that moderated sulfide availability and water column oxygenation. Thus, we argue that the proportional contribution of anoxygenic photosynthesis to overall primary production would have influenced oceanic redox and the Proterozoic O 2 budget. Later Neoproterozoic collapse of widespread euxinia and a concomitant return to ferruginous (anoxic and Fe 2 + rich) subsurface waters set in motion Earth's transition from its prokaryote-dominated middle age, removing a physiological barrier to eukaryotic diversification (sulfide) and establishing, {{for the first time}} in Earth's history, complete dominance of oxygenic photosynthesis in the oceans. This paved the way for the further oxygenation of the oceans and atmosphere and, ultimately, the evolution of complex multicellular organisms...|$|E

40|$|We {{correlate}} processed 3. 5 kHz seismic profiles {{with physical}} properties of cores collected during ODP Leg 167 from the Tanner, East Cortes, and San Nicolas Basins {{through much of}} the Pleistocene succession. Results indicate that seismic horizons in the unconsolidated Pleistocene sediments (top 50 m) are mainly controlled by density contrasts. Removing of the compaction trend from the density reveals a very interesting relationship between density and composition - the density closely and inversely correlates with organic carbon indicating that large-scale variations in organic carbon are responsible for seismic reflections through their influence on density. This is a significant discovery since there apparently is no other paleoceanographic setting that we know of where such a close linkage between acoustic properties and organic carbon has been established. The variations in organic carbon are mainly marine in origin and derive from variations in primary productivity associated with upwelling and the preservation regime related to <b>oxygenation</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> Pleistocene reflections on 3. 5 kHz profiles in the Borderland province thus record regional cyclical fluctuations in the paleoclimatic signals. The close resemblance in the density profiles at the three different basins indicates that the sedimentary regime was similar in those basins through the Pleistocene. These common density patterns produce regional seismic horizons that correlate well among the basins. It is likely these correlated and dated horizons could be extrapolated to other Borderland basins (e. g., San Clemente), where they can potentially be used as time markers for neotectonic studies in the region...|$|E
40|$|The Mekong Delta is {{the most}} {{important}} rice- and shrimp-producing region for food and economic security in Vietnam. Rice-shrimp farming is practised where salinity fluctuates substantially between wet and dry seasons. Research points to several potential risk factors for rotational systems, but how these link directly to both rice and shrimp production remains poorly quantified for systems that stock and harvest animals year-round. We examined water and soil quality of 18 rice-shrimp-crab ponds, in which shrimp and crab are grown in both wet and dry seasons, in the Cà Mau Province of Vietnam. Multiple lines of evidence indicated that environmental conditions experienced by both rice and shrimp were suboptimal and contributed to low yields and survival. Year-round cropping of shrimp and crab was associated with sustained suboptimal salinity, intensified by drought, for the wet-season cultivation of rice. Although rice seedlings were sown in all 18 ponds, only three had a harvestable crop. Low shrimp production and survival was associated with sustained suboptimal water temperatures (too high), salinity (too high in the dry season and too low in the wet season) and dissolved oxygen concentrations (too low). Food availability and quality may also have affected shrimp production. Improving productivity of rice-shrimp-crab ponds in the study region may require (1) separation of rice and shrimp crops and improving efficiency of soil washing practices such that salinity conditions are more suitable for each when grown, and (2) management intervention to increase <b>oxygenation</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and the availability and quality of food for shrimp.

40|$|Post-industrial riverfronts in the ‘Rust-Belt’ {{region of}} the United States have faced the {{consequences}} of [de]industrialization, including massive ecological disturbances. The Lower Cuyahoga River in Cleveland started facing those consequences when it was modified in the 1800 s. The river channel was radically re-engineered with an aim to ease the movement of ships upstream and economize the businesses in that region. On occasion, the river caught fire due to the heavy oil wastes discharged by the industries. Subsequently the river’s health deteriorated affecting the aquatic habitat and the riverfront landscapes. The purpose of this thesis is to suggest how the lost river ecology of the Lower Cuyahoga River in Cleveland might be recovered by establishing habitat pockets and zones that support aquatic life. Landscape solutions are proposed to improve the water quality by reducing contaminants that are carried into the river by overland flow. These interventions would allow {{for the creation of}} public amenities along the riverfront, and reintegration of the fragmented post-industrial fabric. The infrastructure along the riverfront has a strong correlation with the health of the river, thus adaptive-reuse of existing infrastructure is a major strategy explored in this thesis. Because this design thesis also focuses on the deteriorating ecological health of the river, it proposes test sites for the decontamination and <b>oxygenation</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to support fish habitat. Vacant and contaminated sites are considered centers for treating the harmful chemicals present in the landscape, carried into the river with overland flow.

40|$|Quelques mois après le début de la mise en eau du barrage de Petit Saut, la mise en service normale de l'usine conduisait à une désoxygénation de l'eau du tronçon de rivière aval, le rendant {{incompatible}} avec la vie aquatique. La solution retenue a été la construction d'un seuil, afin d'apporter de l'oxygène et d'éliminer les gaz réducteurs produits au fond de la retenue, notamment le méthane, consommateur potentiel d'oxygène dissous. Un seuil métallique à deux lames déversantes successives a été construit; sa configuration {{prend en compte}} les principaux critères physiques jouant un rôle significatif sur l'oxygénation de l'eau (hauteur de chute, épaisseur de la lame déversante, le dimensionnement du bassin de réception des chutes, la présence de dispositifs favorisant l'éclatement de la lame d'eau). Placé dans le canal de fuite de l'usine, à une centaine de mètres à l'aval du barrage principal, il est à l'abri des crues et ne crée pas d'obstacle supplémentaire en rivière. L'article chiffre l'effet d'aération de ce seuil pour les deux gaz O 2 et CH 4 dans deux configurations : celles consécutives à l'abaissement partiel de la chute amont réalisé en deux étapes. Après décembre 2001, pour le débit moyen turbiné (près de 200 m 3 /s), l'efficacité d'aération du seuil a baissé de près de 10 % (gain de 80 % en oxygène dissous et élimination de 70 % et 75 % du méthane dissous). Après février 2003, pour un débit de 100 m 3 /s, 75 % du déficit amont en oxygène dissous est comblé et près de 70 % du méthane dissous éliminé. From {{the moment}} tropical reservoirs are impounded, climatic conditions cause rapid (within several weeks) and marked thermal stratification, especially during the dry season. This phenomenon is further exacerbated by the chemical and biochemical processes {{taking place in the}} reservoir due to the decomposition of submerged organic matter. In dense tropical forests, the overhead biomass is estimated at roughly 170 t(C) /ha, and the carbon contained in the soil is also not negligible since it is on the order of 100 t(C) /ha. The degree of biodegradability of the different compounds in the flooded biomass is variable, ranging from a few weeks for bacteria to several centuries for tree trunks. The studies carried out at Petit Saut (French Guiana) show that, immediately after impoundment, only the epilimnion (a few dozen centimetres thick) was oxygenated whereas the hypolimnion was characterized by complete anoxia and a very high methane content (about 15 mg/L). Water quality in the river downstream from the reservoir was of course strongly linked to variations in the water quality in the reservoir as well as to its operating mode. The waters passing through the turbines, coming from the bottom layers, were anoxic and loaded with fixed or volatile reducing compounds (e. g., CH 4, H 2 S), and were responsible for a high immediate or progressive oxygen demand. At Petit Saut, despite an inflow of good quality water, there has been a progressive deoxygenation in the river downstream due to the high methane content (roughly 8 mg/L) of the turbined water. Thus, 40 km downstream from the dam, the oxygen content was less than 2 mg/L and therefore incompatible with most aquatic life. To solve this problem, it was necessary to build an aerating weir capable of reoxygenating the turbined waters and, more importantly, eliminating reducing gases such as methane at the same time. The function of the overflow weir was to entrain air bubbles into the water and to give these bubbles a sufficiently long immersion time to ensure that they dissolve. At the time of its installation, only three examples of oxygenating weirs existed in the entire world, all located in the United States. The weir configuration was tested using a physical model to qualitatively examine the form of the flow both across the weir and downstream from it. The degree to which air bubbles were entrained in the water was also tested, but not the question of evaluating the flux of gaseous exchanges between the air and the water. The system that was finally designed by EDF, in October 1994, was a metallic weir with two consecutive falls, the configuration of which respected the main physical criteria that {{play a significant role in}} the <b>oxygenation</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> i. e. :- the height of the falls (roughly 5. 40 m, depending on the flow rate);- the thickness of the water stream, the function of which is to entrain air bubbles and keep them in the water for a sufficiently long period of time for the oxygen to dissolve (between 12 and 25 seconds, depending on the flow rate); - the dimensions of the receiving basin of the first waterfall where the air bubbles are held (5 hexagonal alveoli); and- systems to promote the fragmentation of the flow. This structure was placed in the tailrace channel of the plant, approximately 100 m downstream from the main dam. This location protected it from floods and did not create an extra obstacle in the river. In addition, it allowed the water to be re-oxygenated as soon as it left the reservoir. The efficiency of the two waterfalls of the Petit Saut re-aerating weir was tested at two different turbine flow rates: 80 m 3 /s and 230 m 3 /s. In 1996, the results of the measurements showed that for a flow rate of 230 m 3 /s, upstream of the weir the concentrations of CH 4 were around 5 mg/L and dissolved oxygen was 0. 8 mg/L. Downstream from the weir CH 4 concentrations were 1. 3 mg/L and dissolved oxygen concentrations were 6. 8 mg/L. The dissolved methane elimination rate was approximately 75 per cent. At a flow rate of 80 m 3 /s, upstream of the weir the concentration of CH 4 was 5. 5 mg/L and the dissolved oxygen concentration was 0. 7 mg/L. Downstream from the weir concentrations of CH 4 and dissolved oxygen were 1. 0 mg/L and 7. 1 mg/L, respectively. The dissolved methane elimination rate was around 80 %. The efficiency of the re-oxygenation was always greater than 90 %. These data prove that the efficiency of the Petit Saut weir installation was higher when the turbine flow rate was lower. This could be due to a greater waterfall height, the better entrainment of air bubbles per unit volume and/or a longer air bubble residence time in the downstream flow. Between December 2001 and February 2003, for a flow rate of 200 m 3 /s, the efficiency of the weir decreased by 10 %, with the dissolved methane elimination rate at around 70 - 75 %. The level of re-oxygenation was around 80 %. Since February 2003, for a flow rate of 100 m 3 /s, the efficiency of the weir has decreased by 10 %, the dissolved methane elimination rate was around 70 % and the level of re-oxygenation was around 75 %. On a local scale, the effect on the quality of the river water has been very positive, as aquatic life has been maintained. Without the weir, the methane contained in the turbined water would have been progressively transformed, along the course of the river, into carbon dioxide. In the absence of significant additions of good quality water and without the weir, a large part of the course of the river would have a dissolved oxygen content of less than 2 mg/L, the critical threshold for the maintenance of aquatic life. At present time, the results of the current ecological survey are used to support studies on biogeochemical processes...|$|E

40|$|Hypoxia {{in coastal}} environments is a {{worldwide}} problem {{and is expected}} to worsen in future. Due to the stratification <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> column in many enclosed or semi-enclosed gulfs, deep waters are isolated and hypoxic or anoxic conditions frequently become dominant.

The poor <b>oxygenation</b> <b>of</b> deep <b>waters</b> permitted the installation of a particular benthic fauna (graptolites, bivalves ("paper pectens"), echinoderms,…) and, combined with rapid sedimentation, favoured excellent preservation conditions by excluding the development of necrophagous and saprophagous organisms...|$|R
40|$|Water {{pollution}} is often thought to cause accelerated corrosion of steels, particularly in harbors where levels <b>of</b> <b>oxygenation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>waters</b> may be low {{and where there}} may be industrial and shipping wastes. Harbors and coastal regions may also be prone to nutrient pollution from sewage or agricultural run-off. Offshore oilfields also are known to provide sources of nutrient pollution. There are some anecdotal observations but there {{appear to have been}} no systematic field or laboratory studies. Recent field observations have been reported on the effect of nutrient-based pollution on the corrosion of mild steel corrosion coupons. These are interpreted in terms of the phenomenological model previously described in the literature for the corrosion of mild steel under marine immersion conditions. A selection of field data previously reported in the corrosion literature is then considered and shown to have characteristics not inconsistent with nutrient-based water pollution. The effect of dissolved oxygen concentration is noted also...|$|R
50|$|The Late Ordovician Glaciation {{coincided with}} the second largest of the 5 major {{extinction}} events, known as the Ordovician-Silurian extinction event. This period is the only known glaciation to occur alongside of a mass extinction event. The extinction event consisted of two discrete pulses. The first pulse of extinctions {{is thought to have}} taken place because of the rapid cooling, and increased <b>oxygenation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> column. This first pulse was the larger of the two and caused the extinction of most of the marine animal species that existed in the shallow and deep oceans. The second phase of extinction was associated with strong sea level rise, and due to the atmospheric conditions, namely oxygen levels being at or below 50% of present-day levels, high levels <b>of</b> anoxic <b>waters</b> would have been common. This anoxia would have killed off many of the survivors of the first extinction pulse. In all the extinction event of the Late Ordovician saw a loss of 85% of marine animal species and 26% of animal families.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Paleoredox {{indicators}} {{were used}} to assess the depositional environment of the Permian Irati Formation, and discuss the controls on the accumulation of organic-rich sediments. Geochemical data were measured for 43 drill-core samples in southern Paraná Basin. We infer that redox boundary was located at the sediment-water interface during the accumulation of these sediments. Trace-element data demonstrate that Irati shales were similar to average shales, except during deposition of two organic-rich beds in which U and Mo are enriched, suggesting fully anoxic conditions. The variable degree <b>of</b> <b>oxygenation</b> <b>of</b> bottom <b>waters</b> is also attested by DOPT, FeT/Al, and sedimentological indicators of episodic ventilation. DOPT and Fe and S correlation points to an iron-limited environment, where the main sulfur sink is organic matter rather than pyrite. Cu and Cu/Mo ratio suggests bottom-water anoxia driven by increased organic flux. The Irati Formation was probably deposited in a salinity-stratified body <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> with positive water balance. The main control on the accumulation of the organic-rich sediments was the high organic carbon flux resultant from high primary productivity in surface waters. Anoxia arose as a consequence of increased productivity, not as the primary driver in the formation of these organic-rich rocks...|$|R
25|$|Low {{levels of}} {{dissolved}} {{oxygen in the}} <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> the Gowanus Canal predate World War I. The minimum level of oxygen required to support healthy marine life is estimated at 4 parts per million. As early as 1909, an oxygen level of 0 {{was reported in the}} Gowanus Canal. In 1975, a severe lack of oxygen was still observed, indicating that the <b>water</b> was incapable <b>of</b> sustaining plant life or fish. In 1999, just before the flushing tunnel was reactivated, The Environmental Magazine reported that oxygen levels in the Gowanus Canal measured about 1.5 parts per million, a number that continues to be quoted. However, by 2008, nine years after the flushing tunnel was reopened to provide <b>oxygenation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>water,</b> biologist Kathleen Nolan and students from St. Francis College sampled the water and reported that levels of dissolved oxygen had substantially increased. As of 2014, dissolved oxygen levels were reported to be in the range of 9–12 mg/l. (For comparison, note that 1 ppm = 1 mg/l).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the vertical <b>water</b> column distribution <b>of</b> the cyanobacterial toxins cylindrospermopsin and deoxycylindrospermopsin {{in a water}} body containing the cyanobacteria Aphanizomenon ovalisporum and Cylindro-spermopsis raciborskii. The study site was Cobaki Village Lake, a small stratified anthropogenic lake in north-eastern New South Wales, Australia. Water quality analysis indicated that stratification and <b>oxygenation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> column were significant in both {{the distribution of the}} cyanobacterial populations and their associated toxin concentrations. Toxin was distributed throughout the entire water column, but the highest concentrations were recorded in the hypolimnion. Maximum toxin concentrations were detected in February 2007 (38. 2 µg L− 1 cylindrospermopsin (CYN) and 42. 2 µg L− 1 deoxy-CYN). The relative distribution of CYN and deoxy-CYN paralleled the distribution of NH 3 H and NOX within the water column, with oxygenated chemical species dominating above 15 m and de-oxygenated chemical species dominating below 15 m. Cyanobacterial cell concentrations were highest in the oxic, warm and low conductivity <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> the epilimnion and cyanobacterial species succession was associated with nutrient and trace-metal depletion in this surface layer. These research findings are directly relevant to the management <b>of</b> <b>water</b> supplies affected by toxic blue-green algal blooms, particularly with respect to the considered placement of off-take devices to avoid layers of cyanobacterial cell and toxi...|$|R

The measurements reveal a cycloniccirculation in Pine Island Bay and > 1 degC Circumpolar Deep Water flowing beneath and rapidlymelting the floating base of this deep-rooted glacier. Dissolved oxygen measurements show asubsurface <b>oxygenation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> column resulting from air bubbles in the melting ice.

Application of a two-dimensionalthermohaline circulation model to the sub-ice shelf cavity supports average basal melt rates inexcess of 10 m/a calculated by two other methods. This melt rate is more than 5 times the averagereported for any Antarctic ice shelf, drives Circumploar Deep Water upwelling on the continentalshelf, and generates melt-laden outflows that are well above surface freezing temperature...|$|R
40|$|We reconstructed {{oxygenation}} {{changes in}} the Oxygen Minimum Zone of the upwelling ecosystem off Concepción (36 ° S), Chile, using inorganic and organic proxies in a sediment core covering the last ca. 110 years of sedimentation in this area. Authigenic enrichments of Mo, U and Cd were observed between ca. 1935 – 1971 CE indicating a prolonged period of more reduced conditions in bottom waters and surface sediments. Significant positive correlations (p < 0. 05; Spearman) between redox sensitive metals, algal sterols, biomarkers of anaerobic microorganisms, and archaeal glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether indicated a coupling among bottom water oxygen depletion, and increased primary and export production, suggesting that the period with low O 2 of ca. 35 years, follows low frequency inter-decadal variation of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which may have resulted in O 2 depletion over the entire continental shelf off Concepción. Taken together with the concurrent increase in sedimentary molecular indicators of anaerobic microbes allow us {{to suggest that the}} prokaryote community has been influenced by changes in <b>oxygenation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> column...|$|R
40|$|Pelagic and hemipelagic sediments of the Bonarelli Level (uppermost Cenomanian) in the Sztolnia section (Grajcarek Unit, Polish Carpathians) contain trace {{fossils of}} the Zoophycos ichnofacies, {{including}} (in descending order of abundance) : Chondrites (smaller and larger forms), Planolites, Thalassinoides, Palaeophycus, Taenidium, Teichichnus, and Zoophycos. They occur in thick bioturbated layers, which are interbedded with rare, thin layers of unbioturbated black shales. The black shale layers mark the Bonarelli Level and are {{interpreted as a}} record of anoxia or dysoxia. Coeval sections in the Western Tethys contain similar trace fossils but they are less abundant and these sections are characterized by thicker unbioturbated black shale layers and thinner bioturbated layers. This confirms the exceptionally favourable life conditions in sediments of the Sztolnia section, which do not record strong global anoxia during the OAE- 2 event. Such favourable conditions were probably caused by effective <b>oxygenation</b> <b>of</b> pore <b>waters</b> and deep burial of organic matter, which are a consequence of high rates of accumulation and the palaeogeographical location of the section on a flank of a submarine high, under strong circulation...|$|R
