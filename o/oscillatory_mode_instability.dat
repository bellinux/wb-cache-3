30|$|In {{order for}} the <b>oscillatory</b> <b>mode</b> of <b>instability</b> to occur, the {{dimensionless}} oscillation frequency, ω, must be real.

Using the scaling k = O(√(Bi)), where k is the wavenumber and Bi is the Biot number, we derive {{a set of}} amplitude equations. Analysis of {{this set}} shows presence of monotonic and <b>oscillatory</b> <b>modes</b> of <b>instability.</b> <b>Oscillatory</b> <b>mode</b> has not been previously found for such direction of heating.

30|$|Figure 2 c {{brings an}} {{interesting}} insight. Apparently, if {{the concentration of}} microorganisms is above a certain value, the <b>oscillatory</b> <b>mode</b> of <b>instability</b> is not possible. Indeed, ω 2 in Figure 2 c is negative for {{the whole range of}} Rn (- 1.2 ≤ Rn ≤ 1.2) used for computing this figure. This means that ω is imaginary and oscillatory instability does not occur for the value of Rb used in computing Figure 2.|$|R
40|$|In {{models of}} rapid {{directional}} solidification, non-equilibrium interfacial conditions are employed. As a result, {{there is an}} <b>oscillatory</b> <b>mode</b> of <b>instability,</b> {{as well as the}} steady cellular mode, found in the equilibrium model of Mullins and Sekerka. When the temperature field is decoupled from the problem, the preferred wave number for the <b>oscillatory</b> <b>mode</b> is zero, and the interface pulsates in time while remaining spatially uniform. Results from multiple scale analyses in the two limiting cases of the parameters are reported. In these limits, it is found that the instability is a bifurcation to relaxation oscillations; these nonlinear oscillations {{may be related to the}} observed microstructure that results from rapid solidification processes such as laser surface remelting...|$|R
30|$|The {{possibility}} of <b>oscillatory</b> <b>mode</b> of <b>instability</b> in a nanofluid suspension that contains oxytactic microorganisms is investigated. Since these microorganisms swim up the oxygen concentration gradient, toward the free surface (which {{is open to}} the air), and they are heavier than water, they always produce the destabilising effect on the suspension. The destabilizing effect of microorganisms is larger if their concentration in the suspension is larger. The concentration of microorganisms is measured by the bioconvection Rayleigh number, Rb, which by definition is always non-negative (the zero value of Rb corresponds to a suspension with no microorganisms). The increase of Rb thus destabilizes the suspension. It is also shown that the presence of microorganisms increases the critical wavenumber.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} a {{magnetic}} field dependent viscosity on a Soret driven ferro thermohaline convection in a rotating porous medium has been investigated using the linear stability analysis. The normal mode technique is applied. A wide range of values of the Soret parameter, magnetization parameter, the magnetic field dependent viscosity, Taylor number and the permeability of porous medium have been considered. A Brinkman model is used. Both stationary and oscillatory instabilities have been obtained.

30|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to propose a novel type of a nanofluid that {{contains}} both nanoparticles and motile (oxytactic) microorganisms. The benefits of adding motile microorganisms to the suspension include enhanced mass transfer, microscale mixing, and anticipated improved stability of the nanofluid. In order to understand the behavior of such a suspension at the fundamental level, this article investigates its stability when it occupies a shallow horizontal layer. The <b>oscillatory</b> <b>mode</b> of nanofluid bioconvection may be induced by the interaction of three competing agencies: oxytactic microorganisms, heating or cooling from the bottom, and top or bottom-heavy nanoparticle distribution. The model includes equations expressing conservation of total mass, momentum, thermal energy, nanoparticles, microorganisms, and oxygen. Physical mechanisms responsible for the slip velocity between the nanoparticles and the base fluid, such as Brownian motion and thermophoresis, are accounted for in the model. An approximate analytical solution of the eigenvalue problem is obtained using the Galerkin method. The obtained solution provides important physical insights into the behavior of this system; it also explains when the <b>oscillatory</b> <b>mode</b> of <b>instability</b> is possible in such system.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It {{is known}} that the {{addition}} of an insoluble surfactant to a Bénard-Marangoni (BM) layer heated from below or cooled from above can {{give rise to a}} supplementary, <b>oscillatory</b> <b>mode</b> of <b>instability.</b> Here the objective is to see how exactly this plays out in the framework of a recently studied and experimentally tested case of a non-long-wavelength BM instability driven by diffusion-limited evaporation into air in isothermal surroundings. Linear stability analysis is accomplished within a now standard reduction to a one-sided model. In the absence of surfactant, we just recover the classical Pearson problem, albeit with an evaporation-specific wavenumber-dependent Biot number potentially attaining large values for strongly volatile liquids. Adding a surfactant not only sharply stabilizes the monotonic Pearson-like mode, but also leads to a more dangerous <b>oscillatory</b> <b>mode,</b> a parametric study of which is here undertaken. Although slanted towards the evaporative case, the present study is also of interest from the general viewpoint of the Pearson problem + an insoluble surfactant, the results for which are scarce in the literature without being obscured by further effects. In particular, an asymptotic analysis based on small interfacial Lewis numbers (diffusion coefficients) is undertaken near the codimension- 2 point.

40|$|A {{model for}} double-diffusive {{convection}} in an anisotropic porous layer with a constant throughflow is explored, with penetrative convection being simulated via an internal heat source. Both linear instability and nonlinear stability analyses are performed {{to assess the}} suitability of linear theory to predict the destabilisation of the throughflow. It is shown that due to <b>oscillatory</b> <b>instability</b> <b>modes,</b> there are three distinct regions, where increasing the ascending throughflow from rest actually has a stabilising effect, before following the standard destabilisation and stabilisation pattern. This is a previously unobserved phenomenon. The agreement between the linear and nonlinear thresholds is substantial when a small descending throughflow is introduced, although this does deteriorate for ascending throughflow...|$|R

Darcy porous medium is {{considered in the}} presence of vertical throughflow and time periodic thermal boundaries. Only infinitesimal disturbances are considered. The disturbances in velocity, temperature and solutal fields are treated by a perturbation expansion in powers of amplitude of applied temperature field. The effect of throughflow has either to stabilize or to destabilize the system for stress free and isothermal boundary conditions. Nusselt and Sherwood numbers are obtained numerically and presented the results on heat and mass transfer. It is found that, throughflow and thermal modulation can be used alternatively to control the heat and mass transfer. Further, it is also found that oscillatory flow enhances the heat and mass transfer than stationary flow. Effect of modulation frequency and phase angle on mean Nusselt number is also discussed...|$|R

The Japanese-led space VLBI project VSOP has presented an opportunity for such studies, by reaching baseline lengths of up to 36, 000 km and resolving structures down to an angular size of ≈ 0. 3 mas at 5 GHz. VSOP observations of the jet in 0836 + 710 at 1. 6 and 5 GHz have enabled tracing of the radial structure of the flow on scales from 2 mas to 200 mas along the jet and determination of the wavelengths of individual <b>oscillatory</b> <b>modes</b> responsible {{for the formation of}} the structure observed. We apply linear stability analysis to identify the <b>oscillatory</b> <b>modes</b> with <b>modes</b> of Kelvin-Helmholtz <b>instability</b> that match the wavelengths of the structures observed.

The relative importance of the different modes varies among the nine climate regions, grouping them into three mega-regions: Southeastern comprising the South, Southeast and Ohio Valley; Central comprising the Southwest, Upper Midwest, and Northeast; and Northwestern comprising the West, Northwest, and Northern Rockies & Plains. The defining characteristics of the mega-regions are: Southeastern [...] dominated by the AMO, no PDO influence; Central [...] influenced by the AMO, no PDO influence, Northwestern [...] influenced by both the AMO and PDO. Temperature vs. time curves calculated by combining the separate monotonic and <b>oscillatory</b> <b>modes</b> agree well with the measured temperature time series, indicating that the 1938 - 1974 small decrease in contiguous U.

40|$|Abstract—We {{overview}} {{theoretical and}} experimental results on spatial optical solitons excited in arrays of nonlinear waveguides. First, we briefly summarize the basic {{properties of the}} discrete nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation frequently employed to study spatially localized modes in arrays, the so-called discrete solitons. Then, we introduce an improved analytical model that describes a periodic structure of thin-film nonlinear waveguides embedded into an otherwise linear dielectric medium. Such a model of waveguide arrays goes beyond the discrete NLS equation and allows studying many new features of the nonlinear dynamics in arrays, including the complete bandgap spectrum, modulational <b>instability</b> of extended <b>modes,</b> different types of gap solitons, the <b>mode</b> <b>oscillatory</b> <b>instability,</b> the instability-induced soliton dynamics, etc. Additionally, we summarize the recent experimental results on the generation and steering of spatial solitons and diffraction management in waveguide arrays. We also demonstrate that many effects associated with the dynamics of discrete gap solitons {{can be observed in}} a binary waveguide array. Finally, we discuss the important concept of two-dimensional (2 -D) networks of nonlinear waveguides, not yet verified experimentally, which provides a roadmap for the future developments of this field. In particular, 2 -D networks of nonlinear waveguides may allow a possibility of realizing useful functional operations with discrete solitons such as blocking, routing, and time gating.
