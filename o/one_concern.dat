5|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} {{noted that}} Great Lakes cargo vessels could normally avoid severe storms, {{and called for}} the establishment of a limiting sea state applicable to Great Lakes bulk cargo vessels. This would restrict the operation of vessels in sea states above the limiting value. <b>One</b> <b>concern</b> was that shipping companies pressured the captains to deliver cargo as quickly and cheaply as possible regardless of bad weather. At the time of Fitzgeralds foundering, there was no evidence that any governmental regulatory agency tried to control vessel movement in foul weather despite the historical record that hundreds of Great Lakes vessels had been wrecked in storms. The USCG took the position that only the captain could decide when it was safe to sail.|$|E

25|$|Whenever {{an immune}} {{response}} is provoked, {{there is some}} risk of autoimmunity. Therefore, immunocontraception trials typically check for signs of autoimmune disease. <b>One</b> <b>concern</b> with zona pellucida vaccination, in particular, is that in certain cases {{it appears to be}} correlated with ovarian pathogenesis. However, ovarian disease has not been observed in every trial of zona pellucida vaccination, and when observed, has not always been irreversible.|$|E
25|$|Activist {{groups had}} long {{expressed}} {{concern over the}} memberships of the People's Republic of China, Zimbabwe, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan, and the past memberships of Algeria, Syria, Libya, Uganda and Vietnam on the Commission. These countries had extensive records of human rights violations, and <b>one</b> <b>concern</b> was that by working against resolutions on the commission condemning human rights violations, they indirectly promoted despotism and domestic repression.|$|E

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>concern</b> is that blastula {{creation}} in SCNT-based human {{stem cell research}} {{will lead to the}} reproductive cloning of humans. Both processes use the same first step: the creation of a nuclear transferred embryo, most likely via SCNT. Those who hold this concern often advocate for strong regulation of SCNT to preclude implantation of any derived products for the intention of human reproduction, or its prohibition.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>concern</b> {{is that we}} may end up with {{thousands}} of vaccines to prevent every virus that can change our cells. Viruses can have different effects on {{different parts of the}} body. It may be possible to prevent a number of different cancers by immunizing against one viral agent. It is likely that HPV, for instance, has a role in cancers of the mucous membranes of the mouth.|$|E
25|$|Happiness is {{typically}} measured using subjective measures – e.g. self-reported surveys – and/or objective measures. <b>One</b> <b>concern</b> {{has always been}} the accuracy and reliability of people's responses to happiness surveys. Objective measures such as lifespan, income, and education are often used as well as or instead of subjectively reported happiness, though this assumes that they generally produce happiness, which while plausible may not necessarily be the case. The terms quality of life or well-being are often used to encompass these more objective measures.|$|E

40|$|À paraître dans le Journal d'Analyse MathématiqueWe {{introduce}} a new, elementary method for studying random differences in arithmetic progressions and convergence phenomena along random sequences of integers. We apply our method to obtain significant improvements on two results. The first <b>one</b> <b>concerns</b> existence of arithmetic progresseions of given length in any set of integers of positive density, with differences {{in a random}} subset of the integers.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a system of}} Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equations, where the dependence of the coefficients is nonlinear and nonlocal in time {{with respect to the}} unknowns. We extend the numerical scheme proposed and studied recently by the authors for a single FPK equation of this type. We analyse the convergence of the scheme and we study its applicability in two examples.

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>concern</b> {{related to}} the use of calendar-based methods is their {{relatively}} high failure rate, compared to other methods of birth control. Even when used perfectly, calendar-based methods, especially the rhythm method, result in a high pregnancy rate among couples intending to avoid pregnancy. Of commonly known methods of birth control, only the cervical cap and contraceptive sponge have comparably high failure rates. This lower level of reliability of calendar-based methods is because their formulas make several assumptions that are not always true.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people in}} low-income {{communities}} cannot afford soap and use ash or soil instead. Ash or soil {{may be more}} effective than water alone, but may be less effective than soap. Evidence quality is poor. <b>One</b> <b>concern</b> is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms it may increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it. Like soap, ash is also a disinfecting agent (alkaline). WHO recommended ash or sand as alternative to soap when soap is not available.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>concern</b> {{about the}} use of {{hormonal}} contraceptives in general, but especially in wildlife, is that the sex steroid hormones that are used are easily passed from animal to animal. This can lead to unintended ecological consequences. For instance, fish exposed to treated sewage effluents were found to have concentrations of the synthetic hormone levonorgestrel in blood plasma higher than those found in humans taking hormonal contraceptives. Because the antigens used in contraceptive vaccines are protein, not steroids, they are not easily passed from animal to animal without loss of function.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} modelling the dependence between financial markets. In financial economics, the classical tool is the Pearson (or linear correlation) to compare the dependence structure. We show that this coefficient does not give a precise information on the dependence structure. Instead, we propose a conceptual framework based on copulas. Two applications are proposed. The first <b>one</b> <b>concerns</b> the study of extreme dependence between international equity markets. The second <b>one</b> <b>concerns</b> {{the analysis of the}} East Asian crisis. ...|$|R

High-order schemes are employed to accurately solve the full three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. The study of compressibility effects {{is based on}} decay simulations of anisotropic turbulence with two parametric studies, <b>one</b> <b>concerning</b> the ratio between the compressible part and the total kinetic energy, and the other <b>one</b> <b>concerning</b> the turbulent Mach number. We focuse our attention on the return to isotropy phenomenon. We analyse our results in respect with previous studies...|$|R
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>concern</b> of {{the pilots}} was that no {{airfield}} then in existence, in their view, could safely take an eight-ton aircraft. They also objected {{to the use of}} Hornet engines, because most pilots were accustomed to the less-powerful Wasps and would find Hornets overpowering. Pratt & Whitney's chief engineer, George Mead, knew that this thinking was misguided and that within a few years it would seem antiquated. P's president, Frederick Rentschler, faced with a tough decision, decided to acquiesce to the airline pilots' unanimous demand. The decision created a rift between Mead and Rentschler. Despite the bitter disagreements on design and engines, the 247 was still a remarkable achievement and was Boeing's showcase exhibit at the 1933 Chicago World's Fair.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>concern</b> {{regarding}} {{the intersection of}} medical ethics and humanitarian medical aid is how such assistance can be as harmful as {{it is helpful to}} the community being served. One such example being how political forces may control how foreign humanitarian aid can be utilized in the region it is meant to be provided in. This would be congruous in situations where political strife could lead such aid being used in favor of one group over another. Another example of how foreign humanitarian aid can be misused in its intended community includes the possibility of dissonance forming between a foreign humanitarian aid group and the community being served. Examples of this could include the relationships being viewed between aid workers, style of dress, or the lack of education regarding local culture and customs.|$|E
25|$|Douglas's number <b>one</b> <b>concern</b> was the {{creation}} of Medicare. He introduced medical insurance reform in his first term, and gradually moved the province towards universal medicare {{near the end of his}} last term. In the summer of 1962, Saskatchewan became the centre of a hard-fought struggle between the provincial government, the North American medical establishment, and the province's physicians, who brought things to a halt with the 1962 Saskatchewan doctors' strike. The doctors believed their best interests were not being met and feared a significant loss of income as well as government interference in medical care decisions even though Douglas agreed that his government would pay the going rate for service that doctors charged. The medical establishment claimed that Douglas would import foreign doctors to make his plan work and used racist images to try to scare the public.|$|E

25|$|According to the USGS, {{there is}} a broad {{consensus}} {{that the possibility of}} major earthquakes in the New Madrid Seismic Zone remains a concern, and that the GPS data do not provide a compelling case for lessening perceived earthquake hazards in the region. <b>One</b> <b>concern</b> is that the small earthquakes that still happen are not diminishing over time, as would be if they were aftershocks of the 1811–1812 events; another is that the 4,500-year archaeological record of large earthquakes in the region is more significant than ten years of direct strain measurement. The USGS issued a fact sheet in 2009 stating the estimate of a 7–10% chance of a New Madrid earthquake of magnitude comparable to one of the 1811–1812 quakes within the next 50 years, and a 25–40% chance of a magnitude 6.0 earthquake in the same time frame.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the central {{ownership}} of the teams, all players are paid by the league. This is to ensure that no team receives an unfair advantage over any other with regards to financial success. The payscale has set a number of tiers which group players of similar experience levels, with all players in the same tier receiving the same pay. The ABL has considered the possibility of having one or two marquee players paid above the standard scale, though no final decision has been made with regard to this. <b>One</b> <b>concern</b> about high rates of pay expressed by the ABF was that it was a contributing factor, if not the main factor, in the failure of the previous Australian Baseball League. ABF management has also expressed the concern that if this league were to fail, there may never be another opportunity for professional baseball in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Besides the FAF Gladiators, the Swedish Voluntary Air Force, {{responsible}} for the air defence of northernmost Finland during the later part of the Winter War, was also equipped with Gladiator fighters, known as J8s (Mk Is) and J8As (Mk IIs). The Flying Regiment F 19 arrived in Finnish Lapland on 10 January 1940 and remained there {{until the end of}} hostilities. It fielded 12 Gladiator Mk II fighters, two of which were lost during the fighting and five Hawker Hart dive bombers, plus a Raab-Katzenstein RK-26 liaison aircraft and a Junkers F.13 transport aircraft. The aircraft belonged to and were crewed by the Swedish Air Force but flew with Finnish nationality markings. The Swedish Gladiators scored eight aerial victories and destroyed four aircraft on the ground. <b>One</b> <b>concern</b> was expressed when F 19's executive officer Captain Björn Bjuggren wrote in his memoirs, that the tracer rounds of the Gladiator's machine guns would not ignite the gasoline when penetrating the fuel tanks of Soviet bombers.|$|E
