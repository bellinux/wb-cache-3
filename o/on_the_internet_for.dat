The remake {{was expected to be}} released <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>for</b> free and played on console emulators, since there would be no cartridge version due to financial constraints. Only a semi-working 3D test was actually completed, and the project was discontinued in mid-2000 due to a number of factors, including the accidental loss of Lazur's data and his desire to improve his programming skills.|$|E

25|$|Bipedal {{movement}} is less common among mammals, {{most of which}} are quadrupedal. All primates possess some bipedal ability, though most species primarily use quadrupedal locomotion on land. Primates aside, the macropods (kangaroos, wallabies and their relatives), kangaroo rats and mice, hopping mice and springhare move bipedally by hopping. Very few mammals other than primates commonly move bipedally by an alternating gait rather than hopping. Exceptions are the ground pangolin and in some circumstances the tree kangaroo. One black bear, Pedals, became famous locally and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>internet</b> <b>for</b> having a frequent bipedal gait, although this is attributed to injuries on the bear's front paws.|$|E
25|$|If a {{password}} system only stores the hash of the password, an attacker can pre-compute hash values for common passwords variants {{and for all}} passwords shorter than a certain length, allowing very rapid recovery of the password once its hash is obtained. Very long lists of pre-computed password hashes can be efficiently stored using rainbow tables. This method of attack can be foiled by storing a random value, called a cryptographic salt, along with the password. The salt is combined with the password when computing the hash, so an attacker precomputing a rainbow table would have to store for each password its hash with every possible salt value. This becomes infeasible if the salt has a big enough range, say a 32-bit number. Unfortunately, many authentication systems in common use do not employ salts and rainbow tables are available <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>for</b> several such systems.|$|E
