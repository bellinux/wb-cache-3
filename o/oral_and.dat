40|$|The {{studies of}} <b>oral</b> history <b>and</b> <b>oral</b> {{tradition}} each {{have their own}} distinctive bodies of literature and preferred methodologies, yet share significant overlaps that make them difficult to differentiate. For many indigenous peoples, <b>oral</b> histories <b>and</b> traditions are key to their their past, present, and future lives, and are rarely considered separate. This thesis examines the differences and similarities between the studies of <b>oral</b> history <b>and</b> <b>oral</b> tradition. It explores how these areas of research converge and diverge in form, politics, practice, and theory, {{and the extent to}} which they resonate within a specific ‘indigenous’ context and community. The thesis draws on the life narrative interviews of four generations of Ngāti Porou descendents, the second largest tribal group in New Zealand, whose home boundaries extend from Potikirua in the north to Te Toka-a-Taiau in the south on the East Coast of the North Island. Drawing on these voices, this study offers a commentary on the form <b>and</b> nature of <b>oral</b> traditions <b>and</b> histories from an indigenous perspective, and explores the ways they converge and depart from ‘international’ understandings. An exploration of these intersections offers insights to the ways <b>oral</b> history <b>and</b> <b>oral</b> traditions might be reconsidered as distinctive fields of study. Reconfigured through an indigenous frame of reference, this thesis challenges scholars of both <b>oral</b> history <b>and</b> <b>oral</b> tradition to expand their conceptions. Likewise, it urges indigenous scholars to consider more deeply the work of <b>oral</b> historians <b>and</b> <b>oral</b> traditionalists to further enhance their scholarship. Moreover, this thesis revisits the intellectual and conceptual territory that names <b>and</b> claims <b>oral</b> history <b>and</b> <b>oral</b> tradition, <b>and</b> invites all those who work in these areas to develop a more extensive comprehension of the interconnections that exist between each area of study...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{increase}} in cancer mortality {{throughout the world}} justifies the study of its causes and development. Hungary has the highest mortality rate from oropharyngeal cancer out of forty-six countries. Tobacco use is implicated {{in the development of}} <b>oral</b> cancer, <b>and</b> <b>oral</b> leukoplakia as well. The aim {{of the study was to}} give an overview of the connection between tobacco use <b>and</b> <b>oral</b> leukoplakia, considering the epidemiologic patterns of tobacco habits, the prevalence of smoking in <b>oral</b> leukoplakia, <b>and</b> the effect of smoking on clinically healthy oral mucosa with special respect to central Europe and Hungary. In the data, strong evidence has been found for the role of smoking in the development of both <b>oral</b> cancer <b>and</b> <b>oral</b> leukoplakia. Epidemiologic patterns of cigarette smoking show a steep {{increase in}} central European countries. Cross-sectional studies show a higher prevalence rate of leukoplakia among smokers, with a dose-response relationship between tobacco use <b>and</b> <b>oral</b> leukoplakia, <b>and</b> intervention studies show a regression of the lesion after stopping the smoking habit...|$|R

40|$|Background: Tobacco {{and alcohol}} induces {{generation}} of free radicals and reactive oxygen species, which {{are responsible for}} high rate of lipid peroxidation. Malondialdehyde is {{the most widely used}} marker of lipid peroxidation. The aim {{of the study was to}} estimate serum malondialdehyde level in oral precancer, <b>oral</b> cancer, <b>and</b> normal individuals. Materials and Methods: In this study serum malondialdehyde was measured according to the method of Ohkawa et al in 30 normal individuals and 30 patients each with histopathologically diagnosed <b>oral</b> precancer, <b>and</b> <b>oral</b> cancer. Results: The mean serum malondialdehyde level in the control group was found to be 5. 107 &# 177; 2. 32 &# 951;mol/ml, whereas it was 9. 33 &# 177; 4. 89 &# 951;mol/ml and 14. 34 &# 177; 1. 43 &# 951;mol/ml in <b>oral</b> precancer <b>and</b> <b>oral</b> cancer, respectively. There was statistically significant increase in serum malondialdehyde levels in the <b>oral</b> precancer <b>and</b> <b>oral</b> cancer patients compared with the control group. Conclusion: Increased serum malondialdehyde in <b>oral</b> cancer <b>and</b> <b>oral</b> precancer would serve as a valuable marker for both preventive and clinical intervention, and may deserve further investigation for the early diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis...|$|R

5|$|Although the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia share English as {{a common}} <b>oral</b> <b>and</b> written language, ASL is not {{mutually}} intelligible with British Sign Language (BSL) or Auslan. All three languages show degrees of borrowing from English, but this alone is not sufficient for cross-language comprehension. It {{has been found that}} a relatively high percentage (37–44%) of ASL signs have similar translations in Auslan, which for oral languages would suggest that they belong to the same language family. However, this does not seem justified historically for ASL and Auslan, and it is likely that this resemblance is due to the higher degree of iconicity in sign languages in general, as well as contact with English.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Peck also {{considers}} the Slender Man {{to be an}} authentic form of folklore and notes its similarity to emergent forms of offline legend performance. Peck suggests that digital folklore performance extends the dynamics of face-to-face performance in several notable ways, such as by occurring asynchronously, encouraging imitation and personalization while also allowing perfect replication, combining elements of oral, written, and visual communication, and generating shared expectations for performance that enact group identity {{despite the lack of}} a physically present group. He concludes that the Slender Man represents a digital legend cycle that combines the generic conventions and emergent qualities of <b>oral</b> <b>and</b> visual performance with the collaborative potential of networked communication.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{antimicrobial}} peptides against P. acnes {{is under}} investigation {{as a treatment for}} acne to overcoming antibiotic resistance. In 2007, the first genome sequencing of a P. acnes bacteriophage (PA6) was reported. The authors proposed applying this research toward development of bacteriophage therapy as an acne treatment in order to overcome the problems associated with long-term antibiotic therapy such as bacterial resistance. <b>Oral</b> <b>and</b> topical probiotics are also being evaluated as treatments for acne. Probiotics have been hypothesized to have therapeutic effects for those affected by acne due to their ability to decrease skin inflammation and improve skin moisture by increasing the skin's ceramide content. As of 2014, studies examining the effects of probiotics on acne in humans were limited.|$|E

5|$|There are 13 Aboriginal {{language}} groups, 11 <b>oral</b> <b>and</b> 2 sign, in Canada, {{made up of}} {{more than}} 65 distinct dialects. Of these, only Cree, Inuktitut and Ojibway have a large enough population of fluent speakers to be considered viable {{to survive in the}} long term. Two of Canada's territories give official status to native languages. In Nunavut, Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun are official languages alongside the national languages of English and French, and Inuktitut is a common vehicular language in territorial government. In the NWT, the Official Languages Act declares that there are eleven different languages: Chipewyan, Cree, English, French, Gwich’in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, North Slavey, South Slavey and Tłįchǫ. Besides English and French, these languages are not vehicular in government; official status entitles citizens to receive services in them on request and to deal with the government in them.|$|E
5|$|As in {{all other}} tetrapods, mammals have a larynx that can quickly open and close to produce sounds, and a supralaryngeal vocal tract which filters this sound. The lungs and {{surrounding}} musculature provide the air stream and pressure required to phonate. The larynx controls the pitch and volume of sound, but the strength the lungs exert to exhale also contributes to volume. More primitive mammals, such as the echidna, can only hiss, as sound is achieved solely through exhaling through a partially closed larynx. Other mammals phonate using vocal folds, {{as opposed to the}} vocal cords seen in birds and reptiles. The movement or tenseness of the vocal folds can result in many sounds such as purring and screaming. Mammals can change the position of the larynx, allowing them to breathe through the nose while swallowing through the mouth, and to form both <b>oral</b> <b>and</b> nasal sounds; nasal sounds, such as a dog whine, are generally soft sounds, and oral sounds, such as a dog bark, are generally loud.|$|E
5|$|The Antemoro figure {{among the}} more recent {{settlers}} {{on the island of}} Madagascar. They are descended from Muslim seafarers who are believed to have arrived on the southeast coast around 1500. Boats carrying Muslim settlers had arrived on Madagascar's shores in the past, but there was a marked uptick in arrivals around this time. Upon arrival they encountered several other Malagasy ethnic groups including the Zafiraminia, who also traced their origins back to Mecca by way of East Africa, although some scholars suggest that the origins of the Zafiraminia was in Sumatra and who had developed a high status among Malagasy communities for the knowledge and technology they had carried with them from overseas, and who had the prerogative of practicing ritual animal sacrifice for the ancestors (sombili), a highly powerful and important rite among Malagasy communities. <b>Oral</b> <b>and</b> written historical traditions of the Antemoro describe their desire to secure marriages between the two communities, but these efforts were rejected by the Zafiraminia. A conflict developed between the two groups for supremacy, which the oral histories of other Malagasy groups describe as a battle between two giants. The conflict evolved as additional Arab settlers arrived and joined with their fellow newcomers to become Antemoro themselves.|$|E
