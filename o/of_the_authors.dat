5|$|A {{few minutes}} later at 11:00, The Great Artiste dropped {{instruments}} attached to three parachutes. These instruments also contained an unsigned letter to Professor Ryokichi Sagane, a physicist at the University of Tokyo who studied with three of the scientists responsible for the atomic bomb at the University of California, Berkeley, urging him to tell {{the public about the}} danger involved with these weapons of mass destruction. The messages were found by military authorities but not turned over to Sagane until a month later.

5|$|Soon after, {{physicists}} were {{rocked by}} the news that Wu and Tsung-Dao Lee had demonstrated in the Wu experiment that parity is not conserved in weak interactions.

Ward became one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> of the Standard Model of gauge particle interactions; his contributions on electromagnetic and weak interactions were published in a series of papers he co-authored with Abdus Salam.

5|$|The Icelandic sagas, in {{particular}} Snorri Sturluson in Heimskringla, claim that Sigurd, like Olaf's father, was a great-grandson of King Harald Fairhair {{in the male}} line.

Harald Hardrada's alleged descent from Harald Fairhair is not mentioned and played no part during Harald Hardrada's own time, which seems odd considering that it would have provided significant legitimacy in connection with his claim to the Norwegian throne.|$|E

5000|$|Among the {{conclusions}} that Vanhoozer draws from viewing a text as a communicative act are <b>the</b> involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>author,</b> text, and reader in <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> interpretation. <b>The</b> intended meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> can be discerned {{to a certain}} degree from the text. The text (langue and parole) is not an arbitrary [...] "playground" [...] but part of a covenantal relationship between all people. As a result, <b>the</b> intention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> can be adequately decoded. Another consequence is that the reader/interpreter has a responsibility to honor <b>the</b> intentions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> and try to interpret the text in a way which re-creates <b>the</b> <b>author's</b> intended meaning. This responsibility is coupled with a freedom to determine the significance in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interpreter's community.|$|R
