5|$|Despite {{differences}} in spelling, {{the towns of}} Breckenridge, Minnesota, Breckenridge, Missouri, Breckenridge, Texas, and Breckenridge, Colorado were named in Breckinridge's honor. The Colorado town deliberately changed the spelling of its name when its namesake joined the Confederacy. Fort Breckinridge, Arizona Territory (1860 to 1865), located at {{the confluence of the}} Aravaipa Creek and the San Pedro River, was named in honor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> President. During the Civil War, its name was changed to Fort Stanford in honor of California Governor Leland Stanford, before being changed back to Fort Breckinridge. After the Civil War, the name was changed once again to Camp Grant. Between 1855 and 1862, the county now known as Lyon County, Kansas, was known as Breckinridge County.|$|E

5|$|Dominic Purcell as Lincoln Burrows: Lincoln is a {{high school}} {{drop-out}} and a convicted felon, who is wrongfully accused of and charged {{with the murder of}} Terence Steadman, the brother <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> President of the United States. Purcell was cast three days before the start of production and consequently, he was the last actor to join the original cast. He auditioned for the role while he had a recurring role as Tommy Ravetto on North Shore. Since working on John Doe, Purcell has had an amiable relationship with Fox. Hence, he was sent the pilot script of Prison Break. Scheuring's first impression of Purcell did not convince him as a fit for the role since the actor went to the audition with his hair styled and a tan. However, Purcell's acting won the role. He arrived on the set {{on the first day of}} filming with a shaved head, which amazed Scheuring with the physical likeness of the series' two leading actors.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the 1997 film, Air Force One, 24 {{featured}} the president's personal jumbo-jet (Air Force One). Air Force One {{was featured in}} 24 seasons 2 and 4. Air Force Two (carrying the Vice President but not the President) was featured in season 6. Several actors featured in 24, such as Xander Berkeley, Glenn Morshower, Wendy Crewson, Timothy Carhart, Jürgen Prochnow, Tom Everett and Spencer Garrett also appeared in the film Air Force One. The 25th amendment, which deals with succession to the Presidency and establishes procedures for filling a vacancy in the office <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> President and responding to Presidential disabilities, was also a shared theme between the film and the television series. 24 used the same Air Force One set from another television series, The West Wing.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} also shortened the president's term {{from seven}} years to four years, freed the president to seek re-election after an initial term, and moved impeachment trials from the courts to the Senate. They also created the office <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> president, whose only roles were to succeed a president unable to complete a term of office, to preside over the Senate, and to cast tie-breaking votes in the Senate. The committee transferred important powers from the Senate to the president, for example {{the power to make}} treaties and appoint ambassadors. One controversial issue throughout much of the Convention had been the length of the president's term, and whether the president was to be term limited. The problem had resulted from the understanding that the president would be chosen by Congress; the decision to have the president be chosen instead by an electoral college reduced the chance of the president becoming beholden to Congress, so a shorter term with eligibility for re-election became a viable option.|$|E

5|$|The {{office of}} Vice President had been vacant sixteen times {{due to the}} death or {{resignation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> President or his succession to the presidency. For example, there was no Vice President for nearly {{four years after the}} assassination of Abraham Lincoln. During the impeachment of Andrew Johnson there was no Vice President to succeed him. At that time, the Presidential Succession Act of 1792 provided that the President pro tempore of the Senate would succeed Johnson if he was removed from office. Had the impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson resulted in Johnson being removed from office, Senator Benjamin Wade, then the President pro tempore of the Senate, would have become acting president pending a special presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) celebrates his winning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> President {{position}} on a golf outing with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Robert California (James Spader), and Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). After playing, Robert tells Jim that he dislikes the business plan for the Sabre store, citing the poor quality of the products; he only approved it because Jo Bennett wanted it, but he plans to sandbag it at a high-level meeting, and Jim is stunned when Robert strongly hints {{he is going to}} fire Dwight over it. Jim makes several attempts to stop Dwight from attending the meeting with Robert, but Dwight is heedless and continually insults Jim, who finally decides to leave Dwight to his fate. However, a guilt-inducing phone call to Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) makes Jim decide he has to keep parsing Dwight's insults until he directly tells him {{that he is going to}} lose his job. Dwight ignores the news, thinking Jim is jealous of him, so Jim resorts to wrestling with Dwight outside the conference room. In the meantime, Nellie has Todd Packer (David Koechner) stand in as VP in Dwight's absence. When Dwight makes it into the conference room, he hears Robert planning to fire the VP, so he sneaks out of the conference room and lets Packer take the fall in front of those present. Dwight then silently extends a hand to Jim, and they head back to Scranton with Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), who has reverted to his old grumpy self over the thought of leaving Florida.|$|E

40|$|During {{the medieval}} age <b>the</b> scheme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seven <b>vices</b> constitutes, as John Bossy underlines, {{a sort of}} great {{speculum}} societatis in which all <b>the</b> <b>vices</b> which ingenerate social disorder, conflict and violence can be recognised. The English historian believes that, on the contrary, this system proves itself weak {{with reference to the}} psychological introspection. Various elements, however, convey the impression that <b>the</b> social use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seven vices' structure never obscured <b>the</b> interior life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual. On the contrary, in a first moment <b>the</b> capital <b>vices</b> (as delineated by Giovanni Cassiano) are actually expression and vehicle of a solitary morality: <b>the</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monk, who sees in <b>the</b> genealogy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seven <b>vices</b> a series of psychological conditions progressively turned towards evil and who aims to self-knowledge and self-dominion within a search of purification and of approach to God. Even when, from Gregory the Great's age onwards, <b>the</b> interlocutor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moral message is all mankind and <b>the</b> "mundane" use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seven <b>vices</b> is favoured by <b>the</b> elimination <b>of</b> sloth and by <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> envy, <b>the</b> system's strong social character does not lessen its individual and psychological dimension. When <b>the</b> individual confession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vices</b> becomes obligatory for everyone, the seven vices' structure proves to be a perfect system of individuation and classification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various <b>vices,</b> capable <b>of</b> guiding <b>the</b> whole social body through <b>the</b> administration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> souls, by tracing from the external actions the interior movements which have caused them. And even if <b>the</b> genealogical order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vices</b> tends to turn into a taxonomic, the system does not lose its guiding function <b>of</b> penetrating <b>the</b> human soul's recesses: on the contrary, the powerful psychological analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capital <b>vices,</b> previously guaranteed by the monastic knowledge, finds new strength in the suggestions that, with special reference to human passions, derive from <b>the</b> discovery <b>of</b> Greek psychology...|$|R
