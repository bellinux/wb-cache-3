5|$|Marshal Augereau's arrival from Brest {{with the}} newly formed VII Corps gave the French one more piece <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>news.</b> In the Capitulation of Dornbirn on 13 November, Franjo Jelačić's {{division}} was cornered and forced to surrender. The Russians withdrew to the northeast after Mack's capitulation and Vienna fell on 12 November. The Allies were thoroughly defeated at the Battle of Austerlitz in December and Austria was permanently knocked out of the Third Coalition a few weeks later. The French victory highlighted the effectiveness of la manoeuvre sur les derrières, a special type of strategic envelopment first used by Napoleon in his Italian campaign in 1796. The maneuver called for a pinning force that would occupy a broad front of the enemy line while other supporting units positioned themselves at a specific location in the enemy's flank or rear. As the enemy became more embroiled with the pinning force, the flanking troops would attack at a critical spot and seal the victory. In the Ulm Campaign, Murat's cavalry served as the pinning force that fooled the Austrians into thinking the main French attack would come from the Black Forest. As Murat lulled the Austrians towards Ulm, the main French forces crashed through Central Germany and separated Mack's army from the other theaters of the war.|$|E
25|$|Pentecostalism in Australia {{emerged as}} a loose {{movement}} of churches and evangelists around 1909. Not until 1927 with {{the founding of the}} Apostolic Faith Mission of Australasia (AFM) would the Pentecostal Movement take steps at formally organizing. The AFM, whose name was taken from the Apostolic Faith Mission of the Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles, United States, was centred around the leadership of Sarah Jane Lancaster, founder <b>of</b> <b>Good</b> <b>News</b> Hall church in Melbourne and editor <b>of</b> <b>Good</b> <b>News,</b> and South African Evangelist Frederick Van Eyk.

25|$|One {{characteristic}} of overreaction is that average returns following announcements <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> {{is lower than}} following bad news. In other words, overreaction occurs if the market reacts too strongly or for too long to news, thus requiring adjustment in the opposite direction. As a result, outperforming assets in one period are likely to underperform in the following period. This also applies to customers' irrational purchasing habits.|$|E
25|$|Lawson began {{performing}} {{at a young}} age. When she was only five she sang at Feethams for soldiers wounded during the First World War and soon became a regular at Darlington's Scala theatre on Eldon Street. Lawson took on other roles and in 1920 she had a part in a Babes in the Wood panto. At {{the age of twelve}} she led a performing group of young girls that toured County Durham for three years. In addition to her pure acting ability, Lawson developed into exceptional dancer. In her mid-teens she landed a role in a panto in Brighton and later performed in Frinton-on-Sea in Essex, where she was spotted by comedian Gracie Fields. With Fields's support, Lawson was able to become the resident act at The May Fair Hotel in London. Lawson incorporated into her show the song Varsity Drag from the musical Good News, which at the time was being performed by American Zelma O'Neal at the Carlton Theatre in the West End. Her performance was such a success that when O'Neal returned to the United States, the Carlton Theatre choose 17-year-old Lawson as her replacement. Lawson made her name on stage in 1928 at the Carlton in the role Flo in the production <b>of</b> <b>Good</b> <b>News.</b> In 1929, Lawson departed for Australia on a tour, where she appeared in the productions of The Desert Song and Hold Everything!.|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of {{media coverage of}} the event was deferential. Most major news organizations broadcast the various events live multiple times; during the week, the cable channel C-SPAN broadcast uninterrupted coverage of the funeral ceremonies. A few complained, however, that the television coverage was excessive and preempted coverage of other events. CBS News anchor Dan Rather was quoted as saying: [...] "Even though everybody is respectful and wants to pay homage to the president, life does go on. There is other news, like the reality of Iraq. It got very short shrift this weekend." [...] Throughout the week, media experts reported that the national mourning, televised nearly non-stop on many television networks, provided Americans welcome respite from unhappy reports that American troops were being killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, giving them a sense <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> they had been desperate for since the September 11 attacks.|$|E

Narada serviced [...] "They Are the Roses" [...] to Adult Contemporary and country stations, and [...] "I'm Alright" [...] to Adult album alternative and Americana music formats. Maria Konicki Dinoia wrote in Allmusic that [...] "she pushes the envelope, bringing to the forefront the blending of the Scottish/Irish music found in small doses on her last few albums." [...] One year later, she released her second Christmas disc, Joy for Christmas Day, which continued in her Celtic music influences.

To advertise their services, the church placed fifteen-to-twenty temporary signs in various locations around Gilbert.

Members of the church [...] "would post the signs early in the day on Saturday and then remove them around midday on Sunday". However, the town's Sign Code compliance manager cited the church on two occasions, for exceeding time limits when displaying signs and for failing to include the date of the event on a sign, respectively.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} flows <b>of</b> bad and <b>good</b> <b>news</b> as {{a feature}} of the firm’s information environment. We argue that to the extent that managers delay reporting bad news, this leads to bad news being more concentrated. Measuring flows <b>of</b> bad and <b>good</b> <b>news</b> using flows <b>of</b> negative and positive abnormal stock returns, we find that firms with higher volatility of operations and managerial incentives to withhold bad news exhibit relatively more concentrated bad news flows. This relative concentration is also positively associated with lower earnings quality and a higher risk of shareholder litigation. Our results suggest that the relative concentration <b>of</b> bad and <b>good</b> <b>news</b> flows is related {{to the quality of the}} firm’s information environment...|$|R

Beneš then turned to the Soviet leadership in Moscow, which had begun a partial mobilisation in eastern Belarus and the Ukrainian SSR on 22 September and threatened Poland with the dissolution of the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact. The Czech government was offered 700 fighter planes if room for them could be found on the Czech airfields. On 28 September, all the military districts west of the Urals were ordered to stop releasing men for leave. On 29 September, 330,000 reservists were up throughout the western USSR.|$|E

Australia were not without their troubles, both captain Ian Johnson and his rival Keith Miller were unfit to play so batsman Jim Burke and all-rounder Alan Davidson of New South Wales were brought in as replacements and vice-captain Arthur Morris took command, with Richie Benaud as his vice-captain despite his lack of form and seniority.
