Hermetic compressor motor design also face the same challenge. However, reducing motor size for same compressor capacity will increase the motor power density, with the same motor cooling design as before, motor running temperature will be increased and this affect both motor life and reliability as well as passing UL certification requirement for compressors using OLP (internal <b>overload</b> <b>protector).</b> Hermetic motor cooling improvement using thermal modelling has been investigated before by using thermal network method, with limited accuracy since this do not taken all thermal correlation between motor and compressors. (refer to Purdue paper: thermal modelling ro the motor in semi-hermetic screw refrigeration compressor under part load conditions) However, the real situation in terms of thermal and fluid distribution which affect motor cooling inside the compressor in much more complicated than a pure thermal lumped circuit can represent. With the usage of fluid and thermal coupled simulation method today, we can simulate and understand more accurately the correlation between motor and compressor heat transfer and fluid distribution to optimize motor cooling channel, both in static and dynamic stage, and keep motor temperature under the accepted level while main a good flow for the overall compressor performance. In this paper, different geometry of stator outer diameter profiles are investigated, to balance between the motor efficiency impacts versus the motor temperature increase, compressor and conclude the optimization in terms of stator outer profile for the compressor structure discussed in this paper. Motor efficiency results are calculated and also tested, motor cooling optimization also calculated and tested inside compressor. From the research work done here, we can see that by using CFD tool (ANSYS), compressor motor design engineers can find the optimal stator lamination design, and understand the biggest influence factor to motor cooling, but not important for motor electromagnetic design and performance. In future, if the design concentrated on the important factors, and optimize the motor cooling, compressor design in terms of sizing and cooling correlation would be well balanced between cost and performance...|$|E

50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motor’s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or thermal overloading. These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a faulty condition occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with thermal overload relays. Bi-metal thermal <b>overload</b> <b>protectors</b> are embedded in the motor's windings and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the bimetallic strips will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the motor. Heaters are external thermal <b>overload</b> <b>protectors</b> connected in series with the motor’s windings and mounted in the motor contactor. Solder pot heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit to de-energize the motor. Bimetallic heaters function the same way as embedded bimetallic protectors. Fuses and circuit breakers are overcurrent or short circuit protectors. Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the motor’s windings and earth system ground. In motor-generators, reverse current relays prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. motor field loss can cause a hazardous runaway or overspeed condition, loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motor’s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will deenergize the motor’s armature. A locked rotor condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. Undervoltage motor protection is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized motor enclosure designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|R
