The MOSFET voltage drop can be modeled as a resistance, with the voltage drop proportional to current. By contrast, the IGBT has a diode-like voltage drop (typically {{of the order of}} 2V) increasing only with the log of the current. Additionally, MOSFET resistance is typically lower for smaller blocking voltages, so the choice between IGBTs and power MOSFETS will depend on both the blocking voltage and current involved in a particular application.|$|E

As their <b>on-state</b> resistance rises with temperature, if the load is approximately a constant-current load then the power loss rises correspondingly, generating further heat. When the heatsink is not able to keep the temperature low enough, the junction temperature may rise quickly and uncontrollably, resulting in destruction of the device.|$|E
40|$|This letter {{presents}} a novel three-state contactless radio frequency (RF) microelectromechanical systems switch for wireless applications. The switch is free from stiction and charge injection issues occurred inherently in contact-type RF MEMS switches, thereby increasing reliability and lifetime. The contactless switch {{is based on}} variable capacitance between signal lines and movable grounded electrodes controlled by electrostatic actuator. The movable grounded electrode has the capability to move bidirectionally, and therefore, the switch can change among ON-, OFF-, and deep OFF-states. Thus, additional isolation can be achieved in the deep OFF-state. The RF measurement {{results show that the}} contactless switch has a capacitance tuning ratio of 5. 25 between OFF- and <b>ON-states,</b> and a higher tuning ratio of 11. 18 between deep OFF- and <b>ON-states.</b> In addition, the switch exhibits - 3. 62 dB insertion loss and - 24. 43 dB isolation at 2. 4 GHz. At 5 GHz, the insertion loss and isolation are - 2. 95 dB and - 20. 65 dB, respectively. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringNo Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|We present {{experiments}} {{to determine the}} quantum efficiency and emission oscillator strength of exclusively the emitting states of the widely used enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). We positioned the emitters at precisely defined distances from a mirror to control the local density of optical states, resulting in characteristic changes in the fluorescence decay rate that we monitored by fluorescence lifetime microscopy. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first emission lifetime control of a biological emitter. From the oscillation of the observed emission lifetimes {{as a function of the}} emitter to mirror distance, we determined the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of the fluorophore. Since only the emitting species contribute to the change in emission lifetimes, the rates determined characterize specifically the quantum efficiency and oscillator strength of the <b>on-states</b> of the emitter, in contrast to other methods that do not differentiate between emitting and dark states. The method reported is especially interesting for photophysically complex systems like fluorescent proteins, where a range of emitting and dark forms has been observed. We have validated the analysis method using Rhodamine 6 G dye, obtaining results in very good agreement with the literature. For EGFP we determine the quantum efficiency of the <b>on-states</b> to be 72 %. As expected for this complex system, our value is higher than that determined by methods that average over on- and off-states...|$|R

Experimental data of p-type STI-DeMOS device showed distinct two-stage behavior in breakdown characteristics in both OFF-and <b>ON-states,</b> unlike the n-type device, causing {{a reduction in the}} breakdown voltage and safe operating area. The first-stage breakdown occurs due to punchthrough in the vertical structure formed by p-well, deep n-well, and p-substrate, whereas the second-stage breakdown occurs due to avalanche breakdown of lateral n-well/p-well junction. The breakdown characteristics are also compared with the STI-DeNMOS device structure.

2500|$|An IGBT {{features}} a significantly lower {{forward voltage drop}} compared to a conventional MOSFET in higher blocking voltage rated devices, although, MOSFETS exhibit much lower forward voltage at lower current densities due {{to the absence of}} a diode Vf in the IGBT's output BJT. As the blocking voltage rating of both MOSFET and IGBT devices increases, the depth of the n- drift region must increase and the doping must decrease, resulting in roughly square relationship decrease in forward conduction versus blocking voltage capability of the device. By injecting minority carriers (holes) from the collector p+ region into the n- drift region during forward conduction, the resistance of the n- drift region is considerably reduced.

2500|$|Bistable LCDs do {{not require}} {{continuous}} refreshing. Rewriting is only required for picture information changes. In 1984 HA van Sprang and AJSM de Vaan invented an STN type display that could be operated in a bistable mode, enabling extreme high resolution images up to 4000 lines or more using only low voltages. Since a pixel however may be either in an <b>on-state</b> or in an off state at the moment new information needs to be written to that particular pixel, the addressing method of these bistable displays is rather complex, reason why these displays did not {{made it to the}} market. That changed when in the 2010 [...] "zero-power" [...] (bistable) LCDs became available. Potentially, passive-matrix addressing can be used with devices if their write/erase characteristics are suitable, which was the case for ebooks showing still pictures only. After a page is written to the display, the display may be cut from the power while that information remains readable. This has the advantage that such ebooks may be operated long time on just a small battery only. High-resolution color displays, such as modern LCD computer monitors and televisions, use an active-matrix structure. A matrix of thin-film transistors (TFTs) is added to the electrodes in contact with the LC layer. Each pixel has its own dedicated transistor, allowing each column line to access one pixel. When a row line is selected, all of the column lines are connected to a row of pixels and voltages corresponding to the picture information are driven onto all of the column lines. The row line is then deactivated and the next row line is selected. All of the row lines are selected in sequence during a refresh operation. Active-matrix addressed displays look brighter and sharper than passive-matrix addressed displays of the same size, and generally have quicker response times, producing much better images.|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} first {{demonstration}} {{of control of}} the emission lifetime of a biological emitter by manipulating the local density of optical states (LDOS). LDOS control is achieved by positioning the emitters at defined distances from a metallic mirror. This results in a characteristic oscillation in the fluorescence decay rate. Since only the emitting species contribute to the emission lifetimes, the radiative and nonradiative decay rates derived from the lifetime changes characterize specifically the on- states of the emitter. We have thus experimentally determined the decay rates, and by extension the quantum efficiency and emission oscillator strength, of exclusively the emitting states of the widely used Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP). This approach {{is in contrast to}} other methods that average over emitting and dark states. The quantum efficiency of the <b>on-states</b> determined for EGFP is 72 %.

40|$|The {{so-called}} Boltzmann Tyranny (associated {{with the}} Boltzmann distribution of electrons) defines the fundamental thermionic {{limit of the}} subthreshold slope (SS) of a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) at 60 mV/dec at room temperature, which prohibits the decrease of the supply voltage and the power consumption. Adding a ferroelectric negative capacitor in the gate stack of a MOSFET {{is one of the}} promising solutions to break this thermionic limit. Meanwhile, 2 -dimensional (2 D) semiconductors, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), due to its atomically thin layered channel, low dielectric constant, and ease of integration in a junctionless transistor topology, offer the best electrostatic control of the channel. Here, we combine these two advantages and demonstrate for the first time molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2) 2 D steep slope transistors using ferroelectric hafnium zirconium oxide (HZO) as part of the gate dielectric stack. These transistors exhibit extraordinary performance in both <b>on-states</b> and off-states, with maximum drain current of 510 μA/μm, minimum SS of 5. 6 mV/dec. Negative differential resistance (NDR) was observed at room temperature on the MoS 2 negative capacitance field-effect-transistors (NC-FETs) as the result of negative capacitance induced negative drain-induced-barrier-lowering (DIBL).

40|$|The {{presence}} of a visual stimulus not only increases the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activation in its retinotopic regions in the visual cortex but also suppresses the activation of the nearby regions. Here we investigated whether there are multiple components for such lateral effects by using the m-sequence paradigm to measure the stimulus spatial configuration specific BOLD activation. The central target (2 cyc/deg grating) was centered on a fixation point while the flanking stimulus was placed 2 ◦ away and was located on axes that were either collinear or orthogonal to the target’s orientation. Three types of flankers were used: gratings whose orientation {{was the same as}} the central stimulus, gratings which were orthogonal to the stimulus, and random dots. The onset and offset of each stimulus were determined by shifted copies of an 8 -bit long m-sequence. The duration of each state of the sequence was 2 s or 1 TR. The first order activation, computed as the waveform recorded following <b>on-states</b> minus that recorded after off-states, determined the retinotopic regions for each stimulus. We then computed BOLD activation waveforms for the target under various flanker conditions. All flankers reduced the activation to the target. The suppressive effect was largest following the {{presence of}} the iso-orientation collinear flankers. Our result suggests two types of BOLD signal suppression: general suppression, which occurs whenever a flanker is presented and is insensitive to the spatial configuration of the stimuli, and spatial configuration dependent suppression, which {{may be related to the}} collinear flanker effect...|$|R

40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks {{have the}} {{potential}} for profound impact on our daily lives. Smart Dust Wireless Sensor Networks (SDWSNs) are emerging members of the Wireless Sensor Network family with strict requirements on communication node sizes (1 cubic centimeter) and power consumption (< 2 mW during short <b>on-states).</b> In addition, the large number of communication nodes needed in SDWSN require highly integrated solutions. This dissertation develops new design techniques for low-volume antennas and low-power receivers for SDWSN applications. In addition, it devises an antenna and low noise amplifier co-design methodology to increase the level of design integration, reduce receiver noise, and reduce the development cycle. This dissertation first establishes stringent principles for designing SDWSN electrically small antennas (ESAs). Based on these principles, a new ESA, the F-Inverted Compact Antenna (FICA), is designed at 916 MHz. This FICA has a significant advantage in that it uses a small-size ground plane. The volume of this FICA (including the ground plane) is only 7 % of other state-of-the-art ESAs, while its efficiency (48. 53 %) and gain (- 1. 38 dBi) are comparable to antennas of much larger dimensions. A physics-based circuit model is developed for this FICA to assist system level design at the earliest stage, including optimization of the antenna performance. An antenna and low noise amplifier (LNA) co-design method is proposed and proven to be valid to design low power LNAs with the very low noise figure of only 1. 5 dB. To reduce receiver power consumption, this dissertation proposes a novel LNA active device and an input/ouput passive matching network optimization method. With this method, a power efficient high voltage gain cascode LNA was designed in a 0. 13 um CMOS process with only low quality factor inductors. This LNA has a 3. 6 dB noise figure, voltage gain of 24 dB, input third intercept point (IIP 3) of 3 dBm, and power consumption of 1. 5 mW at 1. 0 V supply voltage. Its figure of merit, using the typical definition, is twice that {{of the best in the}} literature.

40|$|Abstract NO (nitric oxide) is an {{intermediate}} of respiratory denitrification {{and is one}} of the toxic species released by macrophages of the immune system in the defence against invading pathogenic bacteria. In Escherichia coli, the expression of the Nitric Oxide (NO) reductase (NorVW) is tightly regulated by NorR, a member of the bacterial Enhancer Binding Protein (bEBP) -family that activates σ 54 -dependent transcription of the norVW genes under conditions of nitrosative stress. Binding of NorR to three conserved enhancer sites upstream of the norVW promoter is essential for transcriptional activation and promotes the formation of a stable higher-order nucleoprotein complex. NorR falls into a class of bEBPs that are negatively regulated – the regulatory (GAF) domain represses the activity of the ATPase (AAA+) domain in the absence of NO. NO binds to the non-heme iron centre of the GAF domain, stimulating ATP hydrolysis by the AAA+ domain and establishing an interaction between the activator and σ 54 that leads to the remodelling of the closed promoter complex. However, the route by which NorR couples signal sensing to substrate remodelling is unknown. Here, the mechanism of interdomain repression in NorR has been investigated by characterising substitutions in the AAA+ domain that bypass repression by the regulatory domain. Most of these substitutions are located in the vicinity of the surface-exposed loops that engage σ 54 during the ATP hydrolysis cycle or in the highly conserved GAFTGA motif that directly contacts σ 54. A combination of genetic and biochemical approaches were used to show that the regulatory domain of NorR is unlikely to control AAA+ activity using previously characterised mechanisms, employed by related bEBPs. Instead, this work identifies a novel mechanism in which the σ 54 -interaction surface of the AAA+ domain is a target of the GAF-mediated repression mechanism. This hypothesis is further supported by EMreconstructions of two characterised escape-variants in their <b>on-states,</b> one of which represents the first structure of a bEBP bound to enhancer DNA. In the case of NorR, regulation at the point of σ 54 -interaction may be linked to the pre-assembly of an inactive hexamer, “poised” at the enhancer sites, enabling the cell to rapidly respond to nitrosative stress...|$|R
40|$|Her X- 1 {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{observed}} and well-studied sources among accreting X-ray pulsars, but despite the detailed insights it provides, a large number of open questions are still to be answered. The light curve of this source shows a strong modulation of the X-ray flux with a super-orbital period of about 35 days. This modulation is well known since the first observation made by Uhuru and consists of two <b>on-states</b> (high X-ray flux) and two off-states (low X-ray flux), with a Main-On (~ 7 orbital cycles) and a Short-On (~ 5 orbital cycles), separated by two off-states (~ 4 ÷ 5 orbital cycles each). The maximum X-ray flux of the Main-On is higher than the maximum X-ray flux of the Short-On by a factor of three to four. This is a clear evidence for a tilted, warped and counter-orbitally precessing accretion disk which covers temporarily the X-ray emission regions. The onset of the flux, the turn-on (often identified with 35 day phase 0. 0), is believed to occur when the outer rim of the disk opens up the view to the X-ray emitting regions near the polar caps on the surface of the neutron star, while the flux decrease towards the end of the <b>on-states</b> is associated with the inner parts of the disk covering these regions from the observer. This source was also the first accreting X-ray pulsar where a cyclotron line was discovered. This feature, which is present in several X-ray binaries, transient and persistent sources, correlates in a positive way with the bolometric luminosity of the source. This is in contrast with other super-Eddington transient pulsars for which a negative correlation is observed. Other interesting observational properties are the systematic energy- and time-evolution of the pulse profiles as function of the 35 day phase and the particular evolution of the spectral parameters as function of the pulse phase. The dissertation presents the analysis and interpretation of X-ray observations of Her X- 1 using data of the X-ray observatories RXTE and INTEGRAL. Using archival data of these two satellites several analyses have been performed. The collection of the data allowed to construct the X-ray light curves and to monitor systematic variations with the phase of the 35 day flux modulation. In parallel to this analysis, several pulse profiles in the energy range 9 – 13 keV have been produced to allow a model-independent investigation of the periodic pulse profile variations. This permitted to extrapolate the so called “phase-zero” which corresponds to the transitions between the off-state and the Main-On, namely the turn-ons. These were compared with the turn-ons observed from the flux modulation. Within statistical uncertainties the two turn-on histories track each other perfectly. On the basis of this analysis, the free precession model which was proposed to explain the variation of the pulse profile is discussed. Further, a deep spectral investigation of the source has been performed. The positive correlation between the centroid of the cyclotron line energy and the bolometric luminosity of the source was confirmed and all the spectral parameters were studied as function of the 35 day phase. The latter, allowed to understand whether within the 35 day super-orbital period, some spectral parameters show variations. This is the case for the absorption NH, the photon-index Gamma; and the intensity of the iron line emission. On the other hand, both the folding energy Efold and the cutoff energy Ecut remain relatively constant. Finally, the pulse phase resolved spectroscopy of RXTE data to monitor the variation of spectral parameters as function of the pulse phase was performed. This improved the picture already known from previous analyses and provided new insights. The variation of the iron line intensity as function of the pulse phase permitted to suggest a possible geometry for the accretion column. Her X- 1 ist eine der am meisten beobachteten und besten untersuchten akkretierenden Röntgenpulsare. Jedoch gibt es trotz genauer Untersuchungen immer noch eine Vielzahl von offenen Fragen. Im Röntgenbereich zeigt die Quelle eine starke Schwankung der Intensität mit einer “Super- Periode” von ungefähr 35 Tagen auf. Diese Schwankung ist seit den ersten Beobachtungen von Uhuru bekannt und besteht aus zwei On-Zuständen (hoher Röntgenfluss) und zwei Off Zuständen (niedriger Röntgenfluss). Diese Zustände werden als “Main-On” (~ 7 orbitale Umläufe) und “Short-On” (~ 5 orbitale Umläufe) bezeichnet. Sie sind durch zwei Off-Zustände (~ 4 - 5 orbitale Umläufe) voneinander getrennt. Der maximale Röntgenfluss des “Main-Ons” ist drei- bis viermal so hoch wie der des “Short-Ons”. Dies ist ein eindeutiger Hinweis für eine geneigte, verbogene und gegenläufig-präzedierende Akkretionsscheibe, welche zeitweise die Röntgenquelle verdeckt. Es wird vermutet, dass der Flussanstieg, der Turn-On, der oft mit der Phase 0. 0 des 35 -Tage Zykluses gleichgesetzt wird, dann auftritt, wenn der äußere Rand der Scheibe den Blick auf die Bereiche freigibt, die Röntgenstrahlung emittieren. Diese befinden sich nahe der Polkappen auf der Oberfläche des Neutronensterns. Dagegen wird die Flussminderung am Ende des On- Zustandes mit der Abdeckung dieser Bereiche durch die innere Scheibe erklärt. Her X- 1 war ebenfalls der erste akkretierende Röntgenpulsar in dem eine Zyklotronlinie nachgewiesen wurde. In zahlreichen Röntgendoppelsternen, sowohl in “transients” als auch in “persistent” Quellen, wurde diese spektrale Besonderheit entdeckt. Bei Her X- 1 wurde eine positive Abhängigkeit der Zyklotronlinie mit der bolometrischen Helligkeit beobachtet. Dies steht im Gegensatz zu anderen super-Eddington “transient” Pulsaren, die eine negative Abhängigkeit aufweisen. Die systematische Energie- und Zeitentwicklung des Pulsprofils in Abhängigkeit des 35 -Tage Zykluses sowie die Entwicklung der spektralen Größen in Abhängigkeit der Puls Phase sind weitere interessante beobachtbare Eigenschaften. In dieser Dissertation wird eine Analyse und Interpretation der Röntgenbeobachtungen von Her X- 1 präsentiert. Die Beobachtungen wurden mit den Röntgenobservatorien RXTE und Integral durchgeführt. Archivdaten boten die Möglichkeit mehrere Analysen anzufertigen. Mit Hilfe dieser Datensammlung konnte eine Röntgenlichtkurve erstellt werden und systematische Änderungen mit der Phase der 35 –Tage Flussänderung verfolgt werden. Zusätzlich zu dieser Analyse wurden Pulsprofile im Energiebereich von 9 – 13 keV angefertigt um eine Modellunabhängige Untersuchung der periodischen Pulsprofil-Änderungen zu ermöglichen. Desweiteren erlaubt dies die Extrapolation des sogenannten “Phase-zero”, welches den Übergang von dem “Off-Zustand” und dem “Main-On”, den “Turn-On”, beschreibt. Die Ergebnisse wurden mit den “Turn-Ons”, die durch die Flussmodulation bestimmt wurden, verglichen. Innerhalb statistischer Unsicherheiten deckt sich der Verlauf der ”Turn-ons” perfekt. Anhand dieser Analysen wird das Modell der freien Präzession diskutiert, das entwickelt wurde um die Variation des “Pulsprofils” zu erklären. Ebenfalls wurde eine detaillierte spektrale Untersuchung der Quelle durchgeführt. Die positive Abhängigkeit der Energie der Zyklotronlinie mit der bolometrischen Helligkeit wurde bestätigt und spektrale Parameter als Funktion der 35 –Tage Phase untersucht. Das Letztere bietet die Möglichkeit zu verstehen, ob innerhalb der 35 –Tage “Super-Periode” einige spektrale Größen Veränderungen aufweisen. Dies ist der Fall für die Absorption NH, für den Photonen Index Gamma; und für die Intensität der Eisenlinie. Andererseits bleiben die Faltungsenergie Efold und die “cut off” Energie Ecut relativ konstant. Schließlich wurde eine Puls Phasen aufgelöste Spektroskopie der RXTE Daten durchgeführt. Hiermit wurde das Bild, das vorherige Analysen geliefert hatten verbessert und neue Einblicke waren möglich. Durch die Variation der Eisenlinien Intensität als Funktion der Puls Phase wird eine bestimmte Geometrie der Akkretionssäule nahe gelegt...|$|R
