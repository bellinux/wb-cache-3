The clinical (heart, kidney, and central nervous system) manifestations are more severe in hemizygous boys than in heterozygous girls. They appear during childhood or adolescence: acroparesthesia, joint pain, angiokeratoma, corneal dystrophy, hypohydrosis or anhydrosis, and renal failure. The <b>otoneurologic</b> symptoms consist of hearing fluctuation, progressive unilateral or bilateral hearing loss, and episodes of vertigo or dizziness. <b>Otoneurologic</b> findings in 12 of 26 members of the same family are presented: the mother and 9 of her 12 children, as well as 2 of her 14 grandchildren: 4 healthy persons, 4 heterozygous female carriers, and 4 hemizygous male patients.

From January to November 2003, 40 elderly patients (19 male, 21 female, mean age ± SD: 69. 5 ± 4. 3 years; range: 65 - 83), with balance disorders, consisting in dizziness or vertigo, have been observed. <b>Otoneurologic</b> and internal case history was collected in all patients, all of whom were submitted to otoscopy, <b>otoneurologic</b> examination, pure-tone audiometry, as well as a specific examination called Equi test. The sensorial analysis, as often occurs in elderly subjects without unbalance, revealed marked impairment of the somatosensorial (85 %), compared to vestibular (60 %) and visual (40 %), subsystems. Longer latencies of motor responses to forward platform translations than to backward translations were observed, even if the symmetry of movements was more evident in the former. Postural adaptation was more frequently impaired during raising of the support (70 %) than during lowering.

The calculation of this index was based upon the patient's wave V absolute latency obtained at a fixed intensity of 90 dB HL and the value of latency predictable by means of the normative data. The index clearly separates retrocochlear from cochlear sites of lesion. Moreover delta V values obtained in defined cochlear lesions show a linear relation with the patient's pure tone hearing loss at 2 and 4 kHz; this behaviour is probably due to a reduction of the auditory dynamic range in the recruiting ears. delta V appears to have clinical usefulness because of two main points: first it is based upon an evaluation of the monaurally evoked ABR; second, it improves the diagnostic specificity of the responses. The rate of false positive results can be further reduced by combining delta V and IT 5 values...|$|E

40|$|OBJETIVO: Verificar o diagnóstico otoneurológico de idosos com tontura e a interferência deste sintoma na qualidade de vida. MÉTODOS: Trata-se de um estudo transversal, realizado com 56 idosos com tontura, com média de idade de 71, 2 anos, submetidos à avaliação otoneurológica que envolveu: audiometria tonal, audiometria vocal, imitanciometria, provas de equilíbrio, pesquisa do nistagmo e vertigem de posição e posicionamento e vectoeletronistagmografia. Para avaliar a qualidade de vida, utilizou-se um questionário específico para tontura, o Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), que verifica os efeitos incapacitantes provocados por este distúrbio. RESULTADOS: A tontura rotatória foi referida por 29 pacientes (51, 8 %), 75 % apresentaram alguma queixa auditiva e 69, 6 % apresentaram audiometria alterada. Os pacientes com queixas {{vestibular}}es de tontura posicional apresentaram diferença significativa para o aspecto físico do DHI. Já os pacientes com queixas vestibulares de desequilíbrio apresentaram diferença significativa para os aspectos funcional e emocional. A vectoeletronistagmografia computadorizada esteve alterada em 47 pacientes (83, 9 %), indicando comprometimento vestibular periférico em todos os casos. No exame pós-calórico, a hiperreflexia foi a alteração mais prevalente e o diagnóstico mais frequente foi o de síndrome Vestibular Periférica Deficitária à Esquerda. Com relação à qualidade de vida, o aspecto funcional apresentou o maior escore médio entre os três aspectos avaliados, e observou-se diferença significativa entre os aspectos funcional e o emocional. CONCLUSÃO: Idosos com tontura apresentam, em sua maioria, alterações na audiometria e na vectoeletronistagmografia, indicando disfunção do sistema cócleo-vestibular; apresentam também qualidade de vida comprometida. PURPOSE: To {{verify the}} <b>otoneurologic</b> diagnosis of elderly individuals with dizziness and the interference of this symptom in {{their quality of}} life. METHODS: Cross-sectional study, conducted with 56 elderly individuals with dizziness. Subjects' mean age was 71. 2 years, and they were submitted to <b>otoneurologic</b> assessment, which involved: pure-tone, speech and impedance audiometry, balance assessment, testing for positional and positioning vertigo and nystagmus, and vectoelectronystagmography. A specific questionnaire for dizziness {{was used to assess}} the quality of life, the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), which verifies the handicap effects provoked by this symptom. RESULTS: Rotatory dizziness was reported by 29 patients (51. 8 %), 75 % presented some hearing complaint, and 69. 6 % had altered results in audiometry. Patients with vestibular complaints of positional dizziness presented significant difference for the physical aspect of the DHI. Patients with vestibular complaints of imbalance showed significant difference for the functional and emotional aspects. The computerized vectoelectronystagmography was altered in 47 patients (83. 9 %), indicating peripheral vestibular disorder in all cases. In the post-caloric assessment, hyperreflexia was the most prevalent alteration, and the most frequent diagnosis was Deficient Peripheral Vestibular Syndrome to the Left. Regarding quality of life, the functional aspect had the highest average score among the three aspects evaluated, and {{there was a significant difference}} between the functional and emotional aspects.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The goal of {{this study}} was to observe {{spontaneous}} cortical activity and cortical activity modulated by tinnitus-matched sound in tinnitus patients and healthy subjects with no <b>otoneurologic</b> symptoms. METHOD: Data were prospectively collected from 50 tinnitus patients and 25 healthy subjects. Cortical activity was recorded in all subjects with eyes closed and open and during photostimulation, hyperventilation and acoustic stimulation using 19 -channel quantitative electroencephalography. The sound applied in the tinnitus patients was individually matched with the ability to mask or equal the tinnitus. The maximal and mean amplitude of the delta, theta, alpha and beta waves and the type and amount of the pathologic EEG patterns were noted during each recording. Differences in cortical localization and the influence of sound stimuli on spontaneous cortical activity were evaluated between the groups. RESULTS: The tinnitus group exhibited decreased delta activity and increased alpha and beta activity. Hyperventilation increased the intensity of the differences. The tinnitus patients had more sharp-slow waves and increased slow wave amplitude. Sound stimuli modified the EEG recordings; the delta and beta wave amplitudes were increased, whereas the alpha- 1 wave amplitude was decreased. Acoustic stimulation only slightly affected the temporal region. CONCLUSION: Cortical activity in the tinnitus patients clearly differed from that in healthy subjects, i. e., tinnitus is not a &# 8220;phantom&# 8221; sign. The changes in cortical activity included decreased delta wave amplitudes, increased alpha- 1, beta- 1 and beta-h wave amplitudes and pathologic patterns. Cortical activity modifications occurred predominantly in the temporal region. Acoustic stimulation affected spontaneous cortical activity only in tinnitus patients, and although the applied sound was individually matched, the pathologic changes were only slightly improved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe {{vestibular}} evoked myogenic {{potential is}} a potential of mean latency that measures the muscle response to auditory stimulation. This potential can be generated from the contraction of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and also from the contraction of extraocular muscles in response to high-intensity sounds. This study presents a combined or simultaneous technique of cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential in individuals with changes in the vestibular system, for use in <b>otoneurologic</b> diagnosis. ObjectiveTo characterize the records and analyze the results of combined cervical and ocular VEMP in individuals with vestibular hyporeflexia and in those with Ménière's disease. MethodsThe study included 120 subjects: 30 subjects with vestibular hyporeflexia, 30 with Ménière's disease, and 60 individuals with normal hearing. Data collection was performed by simultaneously recording the cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential. ResultsThere were differences between the study groups (individuals with vestibular hyporeflexia and individuals with Ménière's disease) and the control group for most of wave parameters in combined cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential.

40|$|Besides Tullio's phenomenon, {{resulting}} from anatomic {{changes in the}} labyrinth, a hypersensitivity to acoustic stimuli of the saccular structures {{appears to be the}} underlying cause of the vestibular responses detected in some patients. In order to evaluate the incidence of vestibular symptoms triggered by acute exposure to auditory stress (disco music), 40 subjects aged between 18 and 26 years, with no audiological and vestibular disorders, were submitted to <b>otoneurologic</b> tests. Subjects were exposed to disco music [intensity 128 dB (C) ], for 3 hours. Tests have been carried out before and immediately after exposure. Canalar and macular functions have been evaluated using vestibular investigation techniques and vestibular evoked myogenic potentials. When compared to baseline data, post-exposure test results did not reveal any canalar damage. Pre- and post-exposure recordings of the vestibular-oculomotor reflex threshold have shown no significant changes. Conversely, post-stimulus recordings have shown {{a significant increase in the}} amplitude of the vestibular evoked myogenic potential response, thus indicating a possible irritative involvement of the macular receptor. This result suggests a direct action upon the receptor by acoustic stimulation which could, therefore, be the underlying cause of vestibular symptoms reported by patients following exposure to sufficiently intense acoustic stimuli. Prior to this study. a questionnaire concerning the relationship between habitual disco visiting and audio-vestibular symptoms has been completed by 310 students at the University of Catanzaro. This survey revealed a significant incidence of vestibular symptoms due to acoustic stress (Tullio's phenomenon) which led us to hypothesise that balance disorders due to auditory stress are much more frequent than commonly held, particularly since, in many cases, diagnoses is unknown or not easy due to the difficult procedures by which these conditions are diagnosed...|$|E

This study presents a combined or simultaneous technique of cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential in individuals with changes in the vestibular system, for use in <b>otoneurologic</b> diagnosis. Objective: To characterize the records and analyze the results of combined cervical and ocular VEMP in individuals with vestibular hyporeflexia and in those with Ménière's disease. Methods: The study included 120 subjects: 30 subjects with vestibular hyporeflexia, 30 with Ménière's disease, and 60 individuals with normal hearing. Data collection was performed by simultaneously recording the cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential. Results: There were differences between the study groups (individuals with vestibular hyporeflexia and individuals with Ménière's disease) and the control group for most of wave parameters in combined cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential. For cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential, {{it was observed that}} the prolongation of latency of the P 13 and N 23 waves was the most frequent finding in the group with vestibular hyporeflexia and in the group with Ménière's disease. For ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential, prolonged latency of N 10 and P 15 waves was the most frequent finding in the study groups. Conclusion: Combined cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential presented relevant results for individuals with vestibular hyporeflexia and for those with Ménière's disease. There were differences between the study groups and the control group for most of the wave parameters in combined cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential...|$|E

Os principais aspectos relacionados à realização, interpretação e utilidade da prova calórica foram revistos. MÉTODOS: Realizou-se revisão sistemática sobre as publicações ocorridas nos últimos cem anos sobre o assunto. Incluíram-se artigos originais transversais e longitudinais, de revisão e meta-análise. Excluíram-se revisões de papeleta, relatos de caso e editoriais. Os descritores utilizados foram: prova calórica, nistagmo, sistema vestibular, preponderância direcional, predomínio labiríntico, teste calórico monotermal, teste calórico com água gelada, fenômeno de Bell. Pesquisou-se as bases de dados COCHRAINE, MEDLINE, LILACS, CAPES. RESULTADOS: De 818 resumos de artigos, selecionou-se inicialmente 93 que preenchiam os critérios de inclusão. A leitura dos artigos resultou na seleção final de 55. Na análise dos artigos, enfatizou-se na discussão fundamentos da prova calórica, tipos de estimulação utilizados, prova calórica monotermal e com água gelada, questões relacionadas à interpretação dos resultados, variáveis e artefatos. COMENTÁRIOS FINAIS: os valores de referência utilizados na prova calórica podem variar de serviço para serviço, com ponto de corte definido a partir de estudos locais. Semiotécnica cuidadosa é {{fundamental}} para elevar a sensibilidade do exame. Caloric {{testing is}} an <b>otoneurologic</b> {{evaluation of the}} status of the vestibular-ocular reflex; it allows an evaluation of each labyrinth separately. The main aspects on the use and interpretation of caloric testing are reviewed. METHOD: A systematic review of papers published in the past one hundred years on caloric testing was undertaken. The inclusion criteria were: cross-sectional, longitudinal, original articles, reviews and meta-analyses. Reviews of patient charts, case reports and editorials were excluded. The key-words were: caloric testing, nystagmus, vestibular system, directional preponderance, labyrinth predominance, monothermal caloric test, ice water caloric testing, Bell´s phenomenon. The databases were: COCHRAINE, MEDLINE, LILACS, CAPES. RESULTS: Ninety-three of 818 abstracts fulfilled the inclusion criteria. After reading these articles, 55 were selected for this study. These papers discussed the basics of caloric testing, the types of stimulation, the interpretation of results, variables, artifacts, and the monothermal and ice water caloric test. FINAL COMMENTS: Caloric testing reference values may vary according to each unit; the the cutoff point is defined based on local studies. Attention to the technique is essential to maximize test sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Whiplash {{is caused}} by an acceleration-/deceleration {{transfer}} of energy to the neck. It commonly occurs in motor vehicle accidents. The force may result in lesions of the cervical spine and soft tissues, which may result in many clinical manifestations: whiplash associated disorders (WAD), according to the Quebec classification. However, the extent of coincident brainstem injury is still unknown. The symptoms of WAD vary, the commonest being: neck pain, concentration difficulties, headache, radicular symptoms, dizziness and visual disturbances. The difficulty of obtaining a documentation on the symptoms described by the patients is well known. In Sweden every year about 10 000 persons suffer whiplash trauma. Six to 9 months after the accident 350 - 400 (i. e., 3. 5 - 4 %) still have symptoms. They will be given the diagnosis of WAD. The aims of the study were: 1) to develop and evaluate an objective test to diagnose WAD; 2) to perform an <b>otoneurologic</b> examination {{of a series of}} patients having WAD with the purpose of finding extent of coincident brainstem injury; 3) to make an audiological study of speech reception; and 4) to investigate some cognitive performances - i. e., reading ability, simultaneous capacity and learning. The investigation took the form of prospective clinical studies of consecutive patients. One series consisted ofpatients with tension-type headache, and the other series of WAD and various control groups. All patients and controls were examined with a method developed for this purpose, the smooth pursuit neck torsion (SPNT) test. Moreover, all patients with WAD underwent caloric, saccadic eye movement, auditory brainstem response tests, and pure tone audiometry. One selected group took the speech recognition-in-noise test. Another study group underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery, including special tests for reading ability. Results The investigation of patients with tension-type headache showed that they had a distinct pattern in the SPNT test. Patients with WAD also had abnormal SPNT test results, but with a different pattern. The sensitivity of the SPNT test in WAD patients with dizziness was about 90 %, and in patients without dizziness 60 %. The specificity was about 80 %. Neck proprioception was aflected in most of the patients. In most patients with WAD the neck, but seldom the brainstemlecrebellum was affected. The audiological investigation showed that about 6 % might have had an accident-related bearing loss. However, 40 % of WAD patients with normal/subnormal hearing had self-reported hearing problems. Thirty percent of the WAD patients with norinal/subnormal hearing in this study had abnormal speech recognition-in-noise. Patients with WAD also showed a considerably poorer reading level than matched controls. A significant relation was found between various reading parameters and the SPNT test. The neuropsychological test battery documented difficulties in simultaneous capacity and learning. Conclusion The SPNT test proved to be valuable for documentation of WAD and the neck seems to be the major organ injured. The brainstem/cerebellum seldom seems to be damaged. Speech reception and reading difficulties were common. Moreover, simultaneous capacity and learning ability are probably reduced in patients with WAD...|$|E
