2500|$|In November 2004, {{an unknown}} entity calling himself [...] "Steev Mike" [...] – a {{pseudonym}} Andrew W.K. had used for himself on {{several of his}} releases – launched a number of websites accusing W.K. of fraud and not being behind his own career. After W.K.'s official website was hacked, apparently by the same entity, W.K. attempted to address the confusion in a public statement in which he wrote, [...] "PLEASE DON'T BELIEVE STEEV MIKE. I USED TO CALL MYSELF STEEV MIKE A LONG TIME AGO AND IT'S NOTHING NOW. Someone is trying to confuse you and make me look bad." [...] In May 2009, W.K. discussed the accusations {{in an interview with}} British magazine Front, in which he stated that [...] "the nature of how we presented my initial offerings caused some confusion, even though I tried to make it as straightforward as possible," [...] and: [...] "Different people I've worked with and different parts <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> story have gotten twisted and changed. But I made the music on my albums – I had a lot of help from incredible people, but not the kind of help that some people think." [...] Wilkes-Krier has denied various theories accusing him of being a fake entity through his official social media accounts.|$|E
2500|$|Ali Osman, 18, {{was charged}} with affray and assault occasioning actual bodily harm for the {{original}} attacks he committed on 4 December 2005 against the volunteer lifesavers and was given 300 {{hours of community service}} for the assault and 200 hours for affray though they would be served concurrently. Osman was the only person charged over the initial confrontation. The Magistrate, Jacqueline Trad (herself of Lebanese descent) told Sutherland Local Court that Osman had turned his back on his real country: [...] "By this sort of conduct you turned your back on your family, your culture and your real country, all for the sake of some juvenile, impulsive and misplaced allegiance.... Over the last 100 years or so, the ancestors of many citizens – mine included – came to this country seeking refuge from hatred, intolerance, violence or just simply the opportunity to improve their families' prospects." [...] Yahya Jamal Serhan was arrested over the stabbing of [...] "Dan" [...] on 12 December and charged with affray and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm and was sentenced to 13 months jail but was immediately released after having already spent nine months in custody awaiting trial. Dan was angered and disappointed by the sentence, saying [...] "I've got no feeling on the left hand side <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> where the knife broke off." [...] A second person, a 17-year–old, was also questioned by police.|$|E
60|$|ZOE: (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half {{sovereign}} {{into the}} top of her stocking) Hard earned on the flat <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
60|$|LIZA [thrilling {{with hidden}} joy] I'm glad. I've {{got a little}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>back,</b> anyhow.|$|R
60|$|On {{the seventeenth}} of the month, I had got my {{passport}} regulated, and had packed up {{the greater part}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> baggage in anticipation <b>of</b> <b>my</b> journey <b>back</b> to England on the next day.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Weel, then, {{the thing}} that was so like him,' said my gudesire; 'he spoke <b>of</b> <b>my</b> coming <b>back</b> to see him this time twelvemonth, and it's a weight on my conscience.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Well, we {{must know}} the worst! Dear me, how the small <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> do ache from that ride yesterday! [...] . But to more godly business!" ...|$|E
60|$|No {{one who is}} {{digging a}} Browning pistol into the small <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> will ever find me disobliging. I opened the door--knocking first, as a mild {{concession}} to the conventions--and the procession passed in.|$|E
60|$|But, alas! this {{arrangement}} {{made such a}} sweeping semi-circle of my hammock, that, while my head and feet were at par, the small <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> was settling down indefinitely; I felt as if some gigantic archer had hold of me for a bow.|$|E
60|$|I {{ran away}} from the care <b>of</b> <b>my</b> cousin Nicodemus <b>back</b> to Bladesover House.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's lost himself," [...] {{answered}} the man, [...] "which {{is about as}} bad. I wish I could lay my hands upon him. I'd get a bit <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>back,</b> one way or another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} delighted to do so, but at present I have no horse. However, I can send one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> lads <b>back</b> to the chateau, to fetch the one that I {{generally}} ride." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would not}} be enough to fill one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> teeth," [...] remarked the Tiger. [...] "A bushel of them, hard boiled, might take a little of the edge off my appetite; but one egg isn't good for {{anything}} at all, that I know of." ...|$|E
6000|$|CAESAR. The Egyptians {{have made}} it up for me. What else is there to do? And mind where you jump: I {{do not want to}} get your {{fourteen}} stone in the small <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> as I come up. (He runs up the steps and stands on the coping.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... “And {{whom have}} I {{to thank for}} this kindness?” I asked, when I stood {{completely}} arrayed, a tiny boy’s cap on my head, and for coat a dirty, striped cotton jacket which ended at the small <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> and the sleeves of which reached just below my elbows.|$|E
60|$|LORD GORING. I don’t at {{all like}} knowing what people say <b>of</b> me behind <b>my</b> <b>back.</b> It makes me far too conceited.|$|R
6000|$|... "Illustrious Capataz, {{for taking}} the curse <b>of</b> death upon <b>my</b> <b>back,</b> as you call it, nothing else but the whole {{treasure}} would do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I felt I {{must see}} you all once more before I died," [...] said her uncle, simply. [...] "Just a flying visit I meant it to be, but your father and mother won't hear <b>of</b> <b>my</b> going <b>back</b> just yet." ...|$|R
60|$|CAPT. G. Yes--quite enough. They just {{allow for}} the full {{development}} of the smash. I'm talking like a cur, I know: but I tell you that, {{for the past three}} months, I've felt every hoof of the squadron in the small <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> every time that I've led.|$|E
6000|$|The {{person of}} the house shrugged her {{shoulders}} and shook her head. 'No. Poorly paid. And I'm often so pressed for time! I had a doll married, last week, and was obliged to work all night. And it's not good for me, on account <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> being so bad and my legs so queer.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "These!" [...] exclaims {{the weary}} traveller, {{beginning}} to feel {{that he does not}} want to go to bed at all. [...] "These are not pillows! I want something to put my head on; not a thing that comes down to the middle <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>back!</b> Don't tell me that I've got to sleep on these things!" ...|$|E
6000|$|And here am I {{going off}} to-morrow to that meeting at Manchester without you! the wildest and most {{impossible}} of moves {{as it seems}} to me. And to think <b>of</b> <b>my</b> coming <b>back</b> by Coventry, on Saturday, to receive the chronometer--also without you! ...|$|R
60|$|Now I felt I {{might start}} out upon my search with some {{assurance}} <b>of</b> finding <b>my</b> way <b>back</b> {{again to the}} prospector.|$|R
6000|$|... "You’ve done it," [...] replied Mr. Billing. [...] "You’ve upset {{everything}} now. Since I {{joined the}} Purnip lot everybody’s {{took advantage of}} me; now I’m {{going to get some}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>back.</b> You wouldn’t ha’ dreamt of behaving like this a few weeks ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|He half regretted {{this speech}} {{the next moment}} in the quick flush--the male {{instinct}} of rivalry--that brought back the glitter of Richards's eyes. [...] "I reckon I kin take care of that, sir," [...] he said slowly, [...] "and I kalkilate {{that the next time}} I meet that chap--whoever he may be--he won't see so much <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> as he did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a wonder!" [...] said Mr. Peters. [...] "You're fresh, and {{you have}} no respect for your elders and betters; but you deliver the goods. That's the point. Why, I'm {{beginning}} to feel great! Say, do you know I felt a new muscle in the small <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> this morning? They are coming out on me like a rash." ...|$|E
6000|$|The only {{objection}} I descry {{is purely}} one of feeling. Pauline trotting about {{in front of}} the float, invoking the orchestra with a limp pocket-handkerchief, is a notion that makes goose-flesh <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>back.</b> Also a yelping tenor going away to the wars in a scene a half-an-hour long is painful to contemplate. Damas, too, as a bass, with a grizzled bald head, blatently bellowing about ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} in September 2011, Tairrie expressed plans to grow her BGD brand: [...] "When {{the time is right}} it might be nice {{to take it to the}} next level at some point and get a few <b>of</b> <b>my</b> ideas <b>backed</b> by a larger company." ...|$|R
60|$|After Warden Atherton and {{his crew}} had left {{me it was a}} matter of minutes to will the resuscitated portion <b>of</b> <b>my</b> body <b>back</b> into the little death. Death in life it was, but it was only the little death, similar to the {{temporary}} death produced by an anaesthetic.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{could put}} a whole {{regiment}} <b>of</b> Dicks on <b>my</b> <b>back</b> without making me feel any better. I know just enough to be uncomfortable, and not enough to go on in spite of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'True,' said Biles, to {{fill the}} time while the parson was engaged in finding the Psalms. 'A man's a fool till he's forty. Often have I thought, when hay-pitching, and the small <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> seeming no stouter than a harnet's, [...] "The devil send that I had but the making of labouring men for a twelvemonth!" [...] I'd gie every man jack two good backbones, even if the {{alteration}} was as wrong as forgery.' ...|$|E
60|$|The more I {{thought of}} it the more certain I became {{that he had made}} a little too much noise with his oars as he rowed away. So I remained, lying in the mud and shivering. I shivered till the muscles of the small <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> ached and pained me as badly as the cold, and I had need of all my {{self-control}} to force myself to remain in my miserable situation.|$|E
6000|$|... "I need {{scarcely}} {{add that}} I never traded {{the lot of}} ivory at Sikukuni's. Another man got it--a German--and made five hundred pounds out of it after paying expenses. I spent the month on the broad <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>back,</b> and was a cripple for six months after that. And now I've told you the yarn, so I will have a drop of Hollands and go to bed. Good-night to you all, good-night!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} matter," [...] said Trevelyan. [...] "Of course I know that {{everybody}} is talking <b>of</b> it behind <b>my</b> <b>back.</b> I am not to expect that people will be silent because I am unhappy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{should think}} I had!' was the hot answer. 'He lifts my camels and scuttles {{back into your}} territory, where he knows I can't follow him for the life; and when I {{try to get a}} bit <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>back,</b> he whines to you. He's a cad--an utter cad.' ...|$|R
60|$|But {{in spite}} of his encouragement, I almost lost heart as I saw one after another <b>of</b> <b>my</b> opponents' <b>backs</b> {{disappear}} in the distance, till at last I was left toiling along the bare white road alone, in a shower-bath of sunlight, with just a dense cloud of dust rising gray far ahead <b>of</b> me. <b>My</b> head swam. It repented me <b>of</b> <b>my</b> boldness.|$|R
