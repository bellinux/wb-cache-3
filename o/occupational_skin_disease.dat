Shoe manufacturing in Indonesia {{is one of the}} industrial sectors that has shown sustained growth amongst the newly industrialized countries (NICs). In this study, we investigated the possible potential exposure of the workers to physical and occupational hazards and determined the prevalence of <b>occupational</b> <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> at a shoe manufacturing factory in Indonesia. Methods A cross-sectional study on the observation of the working process and an inventory and risk assessment of exposure to the chemicals used. Classification of chemicals as potential sensitizers/irritants and qualitative assessments of these chemicals were done. Workers were examined and interviewed using the Nordic <b>Occupational</b> <b>Skin</b> Questionnaire- 2002 /LONG. Results The risk of <b>Occupational</b> <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> (OSD) at the shoe factory was mainly related to the exposure of the workers' skin to potential physical and chemical hazards in hot and humid environmental conditions. From a total of 514 workers, 8. 5 % reported current OSD and 4. 8 % reported a history of OSD. <b>Occupational</b> <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> were diagnosed in 29 % of the workers by dermatologists and 7. 6 % had an occupational contact dermatitis (OCD).

Population-based studies estimating the impact of atopic skin diathesis on <b>occupational</b> <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> in various occupations have not been reported to date. We analyzed data of all initial reports of occupational skin diseases recorded in the register of occupational skin diseases in northern Bavaria, Germany, from 1990 to 1999. The main outcome measure was the attributable risk of atopic skin diathesis on <b>occupational</b> <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> within 24 occupational groups that are most hazardous to the skin. Of the 5285 registered cases, 3730 had a confirmed occupational causation. Among these, 1366 workers (37 %) presented an atopic skin diathesis.

Study design: From 1997 until 2004, 386 patients with <b>occupational</b> <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> were examined and given advice on skin care, skin disease treatment, skin protection in further work, and on the legal rights of patients with this disease. Ten to fifteen years later, we {{wanted to look at}} these patients in terms of their work situation, the current status of their disease, the help they received from the labour offices, and their subjective quality of life. Material and methods: In the autumn of 2011 until the spring of 2012, a number of the patients examined in the period from 1997 to 2004 were selected and sent a questionnaire, which they were asked to answer and return, regarding their work situation and the progress and current status of their occupational disease. Results: A total of 153 (77 %) patients answered the questionnaire; 71 % of these patients were still in work, and further 15 % had old-age retired, 13 % were working until then; 16 % had retired early because of disability; 54 % had changed jobs because of their occupational skin disease; 86 % of the patients indicated that the skin disease had improved since our previous investigation.

40|$|Abstract Background As a {{consequence}} of the disintegration of the state systems and the expansion of the European Union, there have been marked changes in the political and social affiliations of the countries of Eastern Europe. Of the 22 countries in Northeastern, Centraleastern, Southeastern and Eastern Europe, 12 are now members and 10 are "new" neighbours of the European Union. The accident insurance systems and changes in occupational accidents and occupational diseases in eastern European countries are described. Changes since EU and visible differences from non-EU countries are analysed. Special emphasis is given to <b>occupational</b> <b>skin</b> <b>diseases.</b> Methods The available data from the European Union (MISSOC and MISSCEEC Studies on the Social Protection Systems), the database "Social Security Worldwide" (SSW) of the International Social Security Association (ISSA), the International Labour Office Database (LABORSTA), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the annual statistical reports of the different countries were analysed with respect to changes in occupational accidents and occupational diseases. To find missing data, 128 ministries and authorities in the 22 countries in eastern Europe were researched and 165 persons contacted. Results The social insurance systems were very different in the different countries and some were better established than others. Moreover, not all data were available. For these reasons, detailed comparison was not always possible. The occupational accident rates are decreasing in more than half the countries. In contrast, the fatal accident rates have increased in half the countries. The number of newly registered occupational diseases is decreasing in more than half the countries. The rates for <b>occupational</b> <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> in 2006 were particularly high in the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. In half the countries (four out of eight), the number of <b>occupational</b> <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> is decreasing. A reliable analysis of any correlation between EU membership and the rates of occupational accidents and occupational diseases was not possible, because of missing current data. Conclusion Comparison of the social insurance systems and changes in occupational accidents and occupational diseases in 22 countries in eastern Europe makes it clear that further effort is needed to develop registration and notification procedures. Only then will it be possible to analyse changes, to map successes and problems and perhaps to initiate necessary improvements. Standardisation of the documents must also be improved, to allow international comparisons between the systems. </p...|$|R
