5|$|Because of {{excellent}} thermal and chemical stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used {{as parts of}} high-temperature equipment. Boron nitride has potential use in nanotechnology. Nanotubes of BN can be produced that have a structure {{similar to that of}} carbon nanotubes, i.e. graphene (or BN) sheets rolled <b>on</b> <b>themselves,</b> but the properties are very different.|$|E
5|$|These {{polarization}} detectors {{are sensitive}} in the ultraviolet {{region of the}} light spectrum. In some army ant species, a group of foragers who become separated from the main column may sometimes turn back <b>on</b> <b>themselves</b> and form a circular ant mill. The workers may then run around continuously until they die of exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|A more {{indirect}} {{effect would be}} that the contracted s and p1/2 orbitals shield (take <b>on</b> <b>themselves)</b> the charge of the nucleus more effectively, leaving even less for the outer d and f electrons, which therefore move on larger orbitals. Dubnium is greatly affected by this: unlike the previous group 5 members, its 7s electrons are more difficult to extract from an atom than the 6d electrons, though these energy levels remain close to each other.|$|E

5|$|Bounty Hunter: A new mode {{introduced}} in the game. If an online player creates too much chaos in the world, the mode will be initiated. Police, alongside one to three other players, will join the player's game {{with the hope of}} killing the hunted and claiming the bounty, which gives them experience points. The hunted could either strike back at the hunters by killing them, which gives them greater rewards, or escape from them until the bounty expires. The hunted, meanwhile, also can be assisted by another player if that player chooses to join the hunted. Players can manually place a bounty <b>on</b> <b>themselves</b> using the in-game smartphone.|$|E
5|$|CGW {{said the}} in-game combat became a {{confusing}} mess once allies became involved, {{in part due}} to poor Artificial Intelligence (AI) that caused them to use powers liberally and become low on blood as a result. The AI was considered to be insufficient for the game; pathfinding failures meant allies would become stuck on environmental objects or each other during combat, use up their costliest abilities on enemies regardless of their threat, and were poor at staying alive in battle. Enemies were similarly dismissed for either not noticing the playable character in obvious circumstances or failing to respond to attacks <b>on</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following {{requests}} by Singaporeans, {{guidelines for}} the use of the flag were further broadened in 2006 to give residents a variety of opportunities to express their loyalty to Singapore during National Day celebrations such as the National Day Parade. MICA permitted them to display the flag on vehicles and <b>on</b> <b>themselves</b> or belongings with minimal restrictions, from the middle of July to the end of August for a trial period. The period was extended in 2007 to three months from July to September.|$|E

5|$|Halo 3 {{utilizes}} a proprietary, in-house graphics engine. As detailed on the Bungie website, {{it employs}} advanced graphics {{technologies such as}} high dynamic range, global lighting and depth of field effects within cutscenes. Motion blurring was absent from the beta, but {{was added to the}} final game. Most of the dynamic objects in the game cast real-time shadows <b>on</b> <b>themselves</b> and the environment around them, including the game's plant life. Halo 3 uses normal, bump, and parallax mapping to give surfaces more detail without dramatically increasing the number of polygons. Players can see distances of up to ten miles (16km) away, all fully three-dimensional. Real time reflections were written into the engine; however, they are often unused as Bungie considered it a waste of resources.|$|E
5|$|Ric confronts {{his brother}} about Esi, and Kumi {{tells him that}} their father died of AIDS, but the family kept it secret to avoid {{bringing}} shame <b>on</b> <b>themselves.</b> Because of her relationship with his father, Esi is also HIV positive. Ric confides in Diane, who attempts to kiss him, but Ric tells her {{to go home to}} her husband Owen. She asks him to return with her, but Ric says he must stay in Ghana. Abra takes Diane to Kwame, and she pleads with him on Ric's behalf. They go to the clinic, where Kwame tells Ric he will provide the required funding, on the condition that Ric stays in Ghana. Ric agrees, and bids Diane goodbye as she returns to Holby.|$|E
5|$|Super Columbine Massacre RPG! is a {{role-playing}} video game. Players {{control the}} actions of teenagers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold; the pair entered Colorado's Columbine High School on April 20, 1999 and killed 13 people before turning their guns <b>on</b> <b>themselves</b> in a library. Much of the game {{takes place in a}} third-person view, with players controlling Harris and Klebold from an overhead perspective. The graphics and characters are deliberately reminiscent of a 16-bit-era video game; while the content is violent, the violence is not graphically rendered.|$|E

5|$|The {{earthquake}} that struck the Azorean islands was a magnitude 7.2 on the Richter scale. It caused considerable damage on three separate islands (Terceira, São Jorge, and Graciosa), destroying several buildings. According to local reports, roughly 70% {{of the houses}} on Terceira were completely demolished, including the historic quarter of the island capital, Angra do Heroísmo. In general, public buildings such as churches remained intact, while several buildings caved in <b>on</b> <b>themselves.</b> Public utilities such as electricity and water, were reported cut in several areas.|$|E
5|$|Though {{concentrated}} in London, the outbreak affected {{other areas of}} the country as well. Perhaps the most famous example was the village of Eyam in Derbyshire. The plague allegedly arrived with a merchant carrying a parcel of cloth sent from London, although this is a disputed point. The villagers imposed a quarantine <b>on</b> <b>themselves</b> to stop the further spread of the disease. This prevented the disease from moving into surrounding areas but the cost to the village was the death of around 80% of its inhabitants over a period of fourteen months.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} {{electric}} fields created by stationary charges is called electrostatics. The field may be visualised {{by a set}} of imaginary lines whose direction at any point is {{the same as that of}} the field. This concept was introduced by Faraday, whose term 'lines of force' still sometimes sees use. The field lines are the paths that a point positive charge would seek to make as it was forced to move within the field; they are however an imaginary concept with no physical existence, and the field permeates all the intervening space between the lines. Field lines emanating from stationary charges have several key properties: first, that they originate at positive charges and terminate at negative charges; second, that they must enter any good conductor at right angles, and third, that they may never cross nor close in <b>on</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E
