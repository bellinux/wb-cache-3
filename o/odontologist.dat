40|$|The use of {{radiography}} by forensic <b>odontologists</b> for {{the purposes}} of disaster victim identification (DVI) was established in 1949, when it was used to assist in the identification of the victims of the Great Lakes liner “Noronic” disaster in Toronto, Canada. Of the 119 victims of the disaster, positive identification matches were established for 24 of the most severely disfigured cases through the use of comparative odontology radiography (1 - 3). Today radiography is an established tool of forensic <b>odontologists</b> for DVI. The precise requirements for dental radiography for any given mass fatality incident will be determined by the working practices of the forensic <b>odontologists</b> engaged in the investigation.

50|$|<b>Odontologists</b> or dentists {{can be used}} {{in order}} to aid in an {{identification}} of degraded remains. Remains that have been buried for a long period or which have undergone fire damage often contain few clues to the identity of the individual. Tooth enamel, as the hardest substance in the human body, often endures and as such <b>odontologists</b> can in some circumstances compare recovered remains to dental records.|$|R
25|$|While {{the methods}} behind {{collecting}} bite mark {{evidence at the}} scene are leading toward greater standardization, the methodology behind analyzing bite marks is extremely variable because it depends upon the preference of the specific <b>odontologist.</b> As discussed earlier, there are several methods used to compare bite marks ranging from life sized photographs to computer enhanced 3-dimensional imaging. These methods vary in precision and accuracy, {{and there is no}} set standard by which to compare or analyze them. The lack of analytical standards leads to a wide array of interpretation with any bite mark evidence. Some odontologists even disagree on whether or not a mark on the body {{is the result of a}} bite. Therefore, the interpretation of evidence lies largely on the expertise of the forensic <b>odontologist</b> handling the case.|$|E
25|$|Based on the teeth, {{forensic}} <b>odontologist</b> Gunnar Johansson {{has concluded}} {{that the man was}} between 25 and 35 years old when he died. Osteologist Nils-Gustaf Gevall has, based on the skeleton, come up with an age of between 35 and 40 years, though the man might have been up to 60 years old.|$|E
25|$|A {{preliminary}} hearing began on March 11, 2013. The evidence presented {{is subject to}} a publication ban. Magnotta's defence team requested {{the media and the}} public be barred entirely from the hearing; this was declined the next day. Lin Jun's father, Lin Diran, travelled from China to attend the hearing. On March 13, one of Magnotta's lawyers resigned, due to a possible conflict of interest. Expert witnesses testified, including a forensic pathologist, a forensic toxicologist, a forensic <b>odontologist,</b> a bloodstain analyst, data recovery specialists and an Internet investigations officer. The prosecution also displayed video evidence. Both Magnotta and Lin physically collapsed at separate times during the proceedings.|$|E
40|$|Criticism of {{forensic}} science, particularly that of bitemark analysis, {{has become increasingly}} common in the last decade. Much of the criticism directed at forensic odontology cites cases where miscarriages of justice have occurred when erroneous, over-confident or even false bitemark evidence has been tendered by <b>odontologists.</b> Despite Australia's own experience with such cases in the past, it is postulated that this does not represent {{the true nature of}} bitemark analysis as practiced by <b>odontologists</b> today—at least in this country. A review of 119 cases from the last 10 years confirms that ‘identification’ of a suspect is rarely, if ever, offered, and that conclusions reached by <b>odontologists</b> with respect to bitemark analysis are generally conservative. However, {{the results of this study}} also indicate that in a small but significant proportion of cases, there is still some tendency to reach conclusions that could be considered over-confident when considering the overall quality of the physical evidence offered. It is suggested that <b>odontologists</b> should avoid making conclusive remarks regarding the origin of the mark, or the identification of a perpetrator, when such comments are realistically precluded, given the low evidentiary value of the mark itself...|$|R
30|$|In bite mark cases, when {{authorities}} {{have identified a}} potential suspect, his or her dental records may {{provide the basis for}} comparison. It has been proposed that this comparison allows forensic <b>odontologists</b> to establish a correlation between the dental pattern of the suspect and that of the bite mark under analysis (Dailey 2011).|$|R

25|$|There {{have been}} several {{instances}} when forensic dentists have made claims, accusations, and guarantees supported by bite mark evaluation that have been proven incorrect through other forensic sciences. DNA analysis has {{shed some light on}} the limitations of bite mark analysis because often the DNA from saliva surrounding the area of the bite mark proves to be a more reliable form of identification. In the case of Mississippi vs. Bourne, the DNA of a suspect excluded them from the crime after a dentist claimed the bite marks on the victim matched the defendant’s teeth. DNA sampling has been included as a task for a forensic <b>odontologist.</b> For a crime scene investigator, taking DNA samples is as common as taking pictures of the scene. In the case of State vs. Krone, the defendant was sentenced to death, which was overturned. Then Krone was later reconvicted and given life in prison. Both convictions were based largely on bite mark evidence, but ten years later DNA evidence surfaced that identified the real killer and Krone was set free.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, the ABFO {{began making}} {{an attempt to}} {{diminish}} the discrepancies and increase the validity of bite mark analysis by creating bite mark methodology guidelines. The guidelines attempt to establish standard terminology in describing bite marks and that {{reduces the risk of}} biased results. The ABFO also provides advice on how to effectively collect and preserve evidence. For example, they recommend that the collection of DNA evidence and detailed photographs of bites be taken together at the crime scene. The guidelines also outline how and what a forensic <b>odontologist</b> should record, such as the location, contours, shape, and size of a bite mark. They also provide a system of scoring to assess {{the degree to which a}} suspect’s dental profile and bite mark match. According to the ABFO, the guidelines are not a mandate of methods to be used, but a list of generally accepted methods. The guidelines are intended to prevent potentially useful evidence from being thrown out simply because the forensic odontologist’s collection methods were not standardized.|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to characterize the}} nature of disagreement among <b>odontologists</b> in determining the fundamental properties of suspected bitemark injuries. Fifteen <b>odontologists</b> were asked to freely comment on six images of supposed bitemarks. Qualitative analysis using a grounded theory approach revealed that practitioner agreement was at best fair, with wide-ranging opinions on the origin, circumstance, and characteristics of the wound given for all six images. More experienced practitioners (> 10 years) tended to agree with each other less {{than those who had}} 10 years or less experience in forensic odontology. The differences in opinions can be at least partly accounted for by the inconsistent nature of approaches used by different practitioners in assessing bitemark evidence. The results {{of this study indicate that}} more definitive guidelines as to the assessment of bitemarks as patterned injuries should be developed to ensure the highest possible level of practitioner agreement...|$|R
50|$|In 2012, bio-archaeologists, {{forensic}} anthropologists, and forensic <b>odontologists</b> {{created the}} Cementochronology Research Program {{to provide a}} platform for researchers interested in the age-at-death estimation through Tooth Cementum Annulation.

40|$|Forensic <b>odontologists</b> are {{repeatedly}} {{called upon}} {{to assist in the}} identification of deceased persons. A great deal of information is available in the literature as to how and why comparative dental investigation of identification is performed but there is little information on the descriptive terms used in reporting these identifications. A forensic odontology report sets out the findings of a comparison between antemortem and postmortem evidence and indicates the <b>odontologist's</b> opinion on the identification. This opinion needs to be defendable in a court of law. This paper investigates the classifications utilised in the six states and two territories of Australia and reflects on the differences. Three states of Australia use American Board of Forensic Odontology classifications, whilst the remaining regions use a modified format. Since there are no significant legal, cultural or religious differences, and similar practitioners and clients, variation between regions within Australia would seem hard to justify. National standard terminology should be encouraged...|$|R

A list of Argentine boxers of European descent should include: Luis Ángel Firpo (nicknamed [...] "the wild bull of the pampas", whose father was Italian and his mother was Spanish), Nicolino Locche (who was nicknamed [...] "the Untouchable" [...] for his defensive style; both his parents were Italian), etc.|$|E

50|$|When a mass {{disaster}} occurs, either {{natural or}} man-made, odontology {{can be used}} to help identify victims. Some natural disasters include tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires and floods. Man-made disasters can be either intentional or unintentional and include transportation accidents, chemical spills and explosions. Once a mass fatality occurs, forensic <b>odontologists</b> are called in to conduct dental autopsies on remains and compare ante and post mortem dental records.|$|R
40|$|Motivation: To {{know the}} {{expectations}} of odontology professionals, including students, parents and caregivers of Special Needs Patients with respect to characteristics considered to be important of a health professional that deals with Special Needs Patients in his/her practice. Objective: To compare and contrast expectations of this four groups of respondents. Material and Method: Convenience Sample of 245 respondents in the City of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais interviewed {{by the end of}} 2002 and beginning of 2003. Opend-ended answers were divided into three meaningful groups of responses: "To Know How to Do", "To Know How to Be" and "To Be". Analysis was done using the Fisher’s exact test. Conclusions: <b>Odontologists</b> (including students) and Parents and Caregivers have different views about what is needed in order for a health professional to deal with Special Needs Patients. Parents and Caregivers mentioned aspects related to "Know How to Be" (such as ‘love’, ‘patience’, ‘care’) at least once much more often than <b>Odontologists</b> did (including students) (85 % versus 55 % respectively).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Dental case notes record {{clinical}} diagnoses and treatments, as well {{as providing}} continuity of patient care. They are also used for dento-legal litigation and forensic purposes. Maintaining accurate and comprehensive dental patient records is a dental worker's ethical and legal obligation. METHODS: Australian-registered specialist Forensic <b>Odontologists</b> were surveyed to determine the relevance of recorded case note items for dental identification. A dental case notes sample was assessed for adherence with Odontologist-nominated forensic value and compiled professional record keeping guidelines of forensic relevance. Frequency of item recording, confidence interval, examiner agreement and statistical significance were determined. RESULTS: Broad agreement existed between Forensic <b>Odontologists</b> as to which recorded dental items have most forensic relevance. Inclusion frequency of these items in sampled case notes varied widely (eg. single area radiographic view present in 75 %, CI= 65. 65 - 82. 50; completed odontogram in 56 %, CI= 46. 23 - 65. 33). Recording of information specified by professional record keeping guidelines also varied, although overall inclusion was higher than for forensically-desired items (eg. patient's full name in 99 %, CI= 94. 01 -> 99. 99; named treating practitioner in 23 %, CI= 15. 78 - 32. 31). CONCLUSION: Many sampled dental case notes lacked details identified as being valuable by forensic specialists and as specified by professional record keeping guidelines.
