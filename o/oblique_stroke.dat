25|$|State {{highways}} {{are marked}} with posts at irregular intervals giving the distance in kilometres {{from the start}} of the highway. Until recently, all bridges on the network had at each end a small plaque showing the distance {{from the start of}} the highway, usually in the form of a number in kilometres, an <b>oblique</b> <b>stroke,</b> and a further number in kilometres, accurate to the nearest 10 metres. A plaque marked 237/14.12, for example, indicated that the bridge was 14.12km past a set distance post, that post being 237km {{from the start of the}} highway. In about 2004 these plaques were replaced by a new system, which gives each bridge a single number showing the distance from the start of the highway in hundreds of metres. Under the new system the bridge above would be numbered 2511, as it is 251.1km from the start of the highway. Motorway on- and off-ramps are numbered using the same system.|$|E

The superscript indices in the existing scheme (e.g. Re 4/4IV, V, VI…) presented a particular problem for this draft new system's planned method of data collection. By 1988, the drafting process had led to a first draft of a UIC compliant numbering scheme, which, however, never came fully into operation. [...] At that time, the plan was that the first digit of a vehicle's number would denote the number of drive axles, and the second digit would correspond with the superscript used for that vehicle's series under the original system (e.g. Re 4/4II would become Re 420).

50|$|A {{series of}} writing {{exercises}} were presented {{for students to}} develop their skills in rapid penmanship of the business writing style, which he also termed: page writing, body writing, and miscellaneous word writing. Similar exercises featured in most business writing courses of the era.Mills's business writing {{was based on the}} muscular arm movement, first published as the Palmer Method; forearms resting on a horizontal surface, the wrist of the writing hand raised from the page, and the pen controlled using the arm instead of fingers; commonly promoted at the time to reduce hand fatigue and to which Mills referred as free arm movement. He emphasized holding the wrist of the writing hand nearly flat to have the arm best act upon the muscles forward of the elbow. Exercises to help students acquire this movement began with drills of push-pull (<b>oblique)</b> <b>strokes</b> directed using the middle of the body and ovals made by rolling on the forearm muscles. Gradually letter forms were introduced based on the 'correct' movement followed by extensive repetition intended to instil muscle memory for rapid writing.|$|R

50|$|This period {{ranges from}} Yan Zhenqing’s fifties to sixty-five. During these years, he wrote some famous pieces like Guojia Miao Stele (郭傢廟碑) and Magu Shan Xiantan Ji (痲姑山仙墰記). Having {{experienced}} An Lushan Rebellion and frequent vicissitudes in his civil career, Yan Zhenqing’s style was maturing. He increased waist force while wielding the brush, and blended techniques from the zhuan (篆) and li (隷) Scripts {{into his own}} style, making the start and ending of his brushline gentler. For individual strokes, he adopted the rule of “thin horizontal and thick vertical strokes”; strokes’ widths were varied to show the curvature and flow, and the dots and <b>oblique</b> <b>strokes</b> were finished with sharp edges. For character structure, Yan style displays squared shape and modest arrangement, with spacious center portion and tight outer strokes; this structure resembles more the more dated Zhuan and Li Scripts. From {{the point of view}} of spacing, his characters are compact vertically, leaving relatively more space in between lines. Hence, the emerging Yan style had abandoned the sumptuous trend of early Tang calligraphers: it is rather upright, muscular, fitting, rich and controlled; compared to the style of the early Tang which was sloped, feminine, pretty, slim and capricious.|$|R

40|$|The papyrus is incomplete, {{the bottom}} is missing. Traces of a few faded letters of a {{previous}} text are recognizable e. g. in l. 2. The hand is a rather practiced semi-cursive, which {{can be compared to}} P. Prag. I 45 (522), P. Oxy. LXXII 4913 (462) and P. Oxy. LXVIII 4700 (504). These parallels support a date to {{the second half of the}} 5 th or the beginning of the 6 th century. The Coptic l. 11 appears to have been written with slightly larger and heavier letters, yet the extant text does not offer adequate basis for telling whether a different scribe was involved, or whether the same scribe is using a different graphic style. Double <b>oblique</b> <b>strokes</b> are employed to divide units in the account. The back is blank. The papyrus preserves the account of Phoibammon for expenses paid to the carpenter(s) (l. 6 – 9), for a window (l. 11), and for unknown purposes in the months of Phamenoth and Pharmouthi. The scribe started with registering three keratia up to Phamenoth 28, followed by a fourth on an unknown day of Phamenoth (l. 9), which he indicated also by adding l. 5 to the title, and then he continued with three extra entries in Pharmouthi. The second line, which was also added subsequently, might sum up ll. 10 – 12, in which case the account is complete, or it might constitute an extra entry. The most remarkable feature of this account is the insertion of one item (ϩⲓ ϣⲱϣⲧ l. 11) in Coptic, which also breaks the organization principle of the lines (date fi rst). This unusual example of bilingualism within a text may result from the scribe not knowing the Greek word for window. A parallel case is P. Leid. Inst. XXV 79 (7 th cent.) [ [...] . ...|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the letters}} of the script may easily be confounded. In order to reduce ambiguities a small <b>oblique</b> <b>stroke</b> is added at the lower right end as a diacritic.

When the {{consonant}} forms a vowel ligature by which the lower right end is affected, this stroke is shifted to another position. This applies also to consonant ligatures bearing the stroke (see table of consonant ligatures).|$|E

It is written using a grace note (often a quaver, or eighth note), with an <b>oblique</b> <b>stroke</b> through the stem.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a few ideas}} on how to solve certain geometrical problems arising very often in character design, not directly solvable by METAFONTs plain macros. The first part of the paper presents two geometrical problems: the "k problem" and the "x problem", their solutions using dichotomy, and a different solution using path intersections. The latter was proposed earlier on the net by the author; although geometrically correct, it does not work in real-world METAFONT practice: a nice example of METAFONT code : : : to avoid. The second part of the paper presents two simple macro for drawing "loose" Bezier curves; in a sense, the opposite of the tension operator. Finally, the third part solves a problem stated by Alan Hoenig: how to extract text and data out of a METAFONT run, without using the log file. This is done in a straightforward manner by running a Flex-generated preprocessor over the GF file: the Flex code for this utility is given in appendix B. 1 Two Geometrical Problems, Solved by Iterated Calculations 1. 1 Description Suppose you want to design a character `K', as on the left part of fig. 1. The character should fit inside a box of width w and height h, and should consist of three strokes: the vertical stroke z 0 Γ 0 0, and the two <b>oblique</b> <b>strokes</b> z 1 Γ 2 and z 1 0 Γ 2 0. Only constraint: the point z 1 l = z 1 0 r should be fixed (for example, its coordinates can be (0; h 2)). So, here is the problem: Find a stroke z 1 Γ 2 with fixed z 1 l; y 2 l; x 2 r. This problem is not trivial, because METAFONT cannot compute pen positions without knowing in advance the angle of the pen (this stands both for defining a new pen with command pickup pen as for defining a simulated pen with command penpos) [...] . ...|$|R
50|$|Italic {{script is}} {{based largely on}} Humanist minuscule, which itself draws on Carolingian minuscule. The capital letters {{are the same as}} the Humanist capitals, modeled on Roman square capitals. The Italian scholar Niccolò de' Niccoli was {{dissatisfied}} with the lowercase forms of Humanist minuscule, finding it too slow to write. In response, he created the Italic script, which incorporates features and techniques characteristic of a quickly written hand: <b>oblique</b> forms, fewer <b>strokes</b> per character, and the joining of letters. Perhaps the most significant change to any single character was to the form of the a, which he simplified from the two-story form to the one-story form ⟨ɑ⟩ now ubiquitous to most handwriting styles.|$|R
