40|$|This study {{investigates the}} broadcast/multicast {{authentication}} problems in {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs), particularly sensor nodes broadcast authentication and <b>outside</b> <b>user</b> authentication, and proposes efficient and secure solutions for them. The low cost and immunity from cabling have become motivations for many applications of WSNs, for instance, the forest fire alarm, the intelligent traffic system etc. However, the sensitive nature of communication in these applications makes authentication a compulsory security requirement for them. The conventional security solutions are unfeasible for WSNs due to the unique features of sensor networks. Designing a new security mechanism for WSNs, on the other hand, is a challenging task {{due to the nature}} of WSNs. This research proposes a solution to the above mentioned authentication problems in the form of an authentication framework for wireless sensor networks. The proposed framework is comprised of two authentication protocols: one for sensor nodes broadcast authentication and the other for <b>outside</b> <b>user</b> authentication. The latter also facilitates a third type of authentication, i. e., base station to sensor nodes broadcast authentication. These protocols can be applied in WSNs independently tackling individual security problems to achieve different level of security. However, deployed as a unified framework, they ensure a high degree of security with efficiency, providing a single solution to all three authentication problems in WSNs. The performance evaluation results showed that the proposed framework is the most efficient solution when compared to the existing authentication schemes for WSNs, giving a reasonable trade-off between security and efficiency...|$|E

As power is at a premium in sensor nodes, such a technique is necessary to reduce costly communication overhead. To this end, we present an irregular wavelet transform capable of adapting to an arbitrary, multiscale network routing hierarchy. Inspired by the Haar wavelet in the regular setting, our wavelet basis forms a tight frame adapted {{to the structure of}} the network. We demonstrate results highlighting the approximation capabilities of such a transform and the clear reduction in communication cost when transmitting a compressed snapshot of the network to an <b>outside</b> <b>user...</b>|$|E

40|$|Due to {{resource}} {{constraints and}} unique features of {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs), designing a key establishment protocol is much harder for WSNs than for traditional wired and wireless counterparts.

The proposed protocol does not require sensor nodes to compute any expensive pairing function. Moreover, it imposes very light computational and communication overheads and also provides scalability. We analyze security and efficiency of the proposed protocol by comparing firstly the session key establishment protocols for WSNs and secondly the existing ID based one-pass key establishment protocols. The comparison shows that the proposed protocol is the most secure and efficient one for WSNs applications providing both security features of user authentication and session key establishment...|$|E
