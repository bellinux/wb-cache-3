The histomorphometric quantification and determination of collagen degradation products showed increased bone resorption following pinealectomy. Ovariectomy alone results in a transient bone loss at the distal radius followed by continuous increase to baseline levels. The bone resorption activity after pinealectomy causes a bone loss which was not transient, since a continuous decrease in BMD was observed until 30 months.

Materials and Methods: 24 full-grown sheep had ACDF of C 3 / 4 and C 5 / 6 with an experimental bioabsorbable implant (magnesium and PCL) in one level and an autologous tricortical bone graft in the second level. The sheep were divided into 4 groups (6 sheep each). After 3, 6, 12, or 24 weeks postoperatively, the cervical spines were harvested and conventional x-rays of each operated segment were conducted. The progress of interbody fusion was classified according to a three-point scoring system. Results: There were no operation related complications except for one intraoperative fracture of the anterior superior iliac spine and two cases of screw loosening and sinking, respectively. In particular, no vascular, neurologic, wound healing or infectious problems were observed.

The {{present study was}} carried out to derive foetal mesenchymal stem cells from ovine source and analyze their differentiation to osteogenic linage {{to serve as an}} animal model to predict human applications. Methods: Isolation and culture of sheep foetal bone marrow cells were done and uniform clonally derived MSC population was collected. The cells were characterized using cytochemical, immunophenotyping, biochemical and molecular analyses. The cells with defined characteristics were differentiated into osteogenic lineages and analysis for differentiated cell types was done. The cells were analyzed for cell surface marker expression and the gene expression in undifferentiated and differentiated osteoblast was checked by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT PCR) analysis and confirmed by sequencing using genetic analyzer. Results: Ovine foetal samples were processed to obtain mononuclear (MNC) cells which on culture showed spindle morphology, a characteristic oval body with the flattened ends. MSC population CD 45 - /CD 14 - was cultured by limiting dilution to arrive at uniform spindle morphology cells and colony forming units. The cells were shown to be positive for surface markers such as CD 44, CD 54, integrinβ 1, and intracellular collagen type I/III and fibronectin. The osteogenically induced MSCs were analyzed for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineral deposition. The undifferentiated MSCs expressed RAB 3 B, candidate marker for stemness in MSCs. The osteogenically induced and uninduced MSCs expressed collagen type I and MMP 13 gene in osteogenic induced cells. Interpretation & conclusions: The protocol for isolation of ovine foetal bone marrow derived MSCs was simple to perform, and the cultural method of obtaining pure spindle morphology cells was established. Criteria proposed for defining MSCs by this study includes the cell adherence to culture plates, specific surface protein profiles and differentiation to osteogenic lineage.

40|$|Dual energy X-ray {{absorptiometry}} (DXA) is {{the most}} widely used bone quantity investigation in human osteoporosis; it is so ubiquitous that many clinicians now mistakenly equate DXA derived areal BMD with bone strength. Bone strength partly depends on bone mass and the distribution of this mass in terms of size and shape but also depends on bone quality factors of microarchitecture, material properties, accumulated microdamage and remodelling rate. In osteoporosis research, sheep have emerged as a useful lar ge animal model due to size and physiological similarities to humans; and, as a flock animal, large numbers of sheep can be reared at reasonable costs. The aim of this research, part of the ?Bone for Life? group of studies, was to evaluate; DXA scanner val idity in the <b>ovine</b> <b>animal</b> model, DXA derived bone quantity (aBMD) change in an <b>ovine</b> <b>animal</b> model of osteoporosis, and following on from these preliminary studies; to examine the influence of DXA derived aBMD on cortical and trabecular bone mechanical prop erties. In initial validation studies of DXA scanner reliability and assessment of natural variation in aBMD in the Irish sheep population ex - vivo bone samples were sourced from heal thy Irish mixed breed ewes (age > 5 yr) at routine commercial sacrifice. Fur ther samples were also harvested from control (CON) and ovariectomised (OVX) sheep in a specially reared flock at two time points, 12 and 31 month post - ovariectomy, to determine the short - and long - term effect of ovariectomy on bone quantity (aBMD); and in further collaborative studies, bone quantity and quality relationships to mechanical properties. The DXA scan protocol consisted of standardised alignment of the whole sample (WB) on a holding jig within a tank filled with normal saline, followed by basel ine repeat data acquisition scans using a standard algorithm. The same algorithm allowed further analysis (SRA) of six sub - regions down the length of selected long bones femur (FMR), tibia (TBR), humerus (HMR) and radius (RDR); and, the six vertebrae spina l samples (LS); as well as smaller region of interest (ROI) analyses in areas of high trabecular bone content. Statistical analysis was made of initial repeat test data to determine DXA scanner reliability, establish measurement limits; and assess biologic al variability; and for the specially reared flock, inter - group differences in aBMD were analysed for effect of ovariectomy, and then re - analysed in conjunction with bone quality variables to assess the strength of aBMD and bone quality relationships to me chanical test data. xxiii The results of preliminary studies confirmed an acceptable level of; repeatability (ICC > 0. 9), reliability (%TEM 3 - 5 %) and measurement limits (95 %LOA ? 0. 035 g. cm - 2) of the adapted DXA scanning protocol for large ovine bone samples. In a representative sample of the Irish ewes evaluation of biological variability revealed; an aBMD range of approximately 0. 60 to 1. 20 g. cm - 2, minimal inter - breed variation and a small seasonal effect toward lower density in Spring months at some sites. Ana lysis of inter - group differences between CON and OVX detected no significant difference in aBMD post - ovariectomy at any spinal or long bone site at 12 month; but did detect a significant reduction in aBMD in the proximal humeral region and an unexpected fi nding of increased aBMD in the mid - region of the tibia, both with large effect size, at the 31 month time point. In follow on studies; aBMD (r 2 ~ 0. 83) and then structural geometric properties of CSMI (r 2 ~ 0. 75) and section modulus (r 2 ~ 0. 65) had the stronges t association with breaking strength (Fmax) of ovine radii in three point bending. In microdamage analysis of radii exposed to cyclic loading, and stratified as high, medium or low aBMD, results also suggested significantly higher microcrack numerical and surface density in bones with lower aBMD. Analysis of compressive strength of isolated trabecular cores was less clear, but significant inter - group differences in trabecular thickness of large effect size were detected in the CON vs. OVX comparison at the 31 month time point, and in terms of relationships to strength, trabecular number and spacing (r 2 ~ 0. 4 to 0. 5) were better related to compressive strength and modulus than any DXA or microCT derived bone quantity variable. In conclusion this work has further validated DXA bone quantity measurement and defined measurement limits for scanning and sub - regional analysis of whole bone samples in this animal model. Bone quantity data for Irish s heep were of a similar range to those seen in human female populations, and exhibited some seasonal variation again similar to human populations living in northern latitudes. In this animal model ovariectomy alone however, did not prove a sufficient enough stimulus in the short - term to produce a significant reduction in bone quantity detectable by DXA in time frames suitable for research; however longer term changes detected in the proximal humerus and tibia require further evaluation. In terms of relations hips to strength DXA derived aBMD data was the better predictor of bending strength in a typical long bone mid - shaft site; but in compression of isolated trabecular cores, bone quality factors were more closely associated to mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Injury {{to growth}} plate {{cartilage}} in children {{can lead to}} bone bridge formation and result in bone growth deformities, a significant clinical problem currently lacking biological treatment. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) offer a promising therapeutic option for regeneration of damaged cartilage, due to their self renewing and multi-lineage differentiation attributes. Although some small animal model studies highlight the therapeutic potential of MSC for growth plate repair, translational research in large animal models, which more closely resemble the human condition, are lacking. Our laboratory has recently characterised MSCs derived from ovine bone marrow, and demonstrated these cells form cartilage-like tissue when transplanted within the gelatin sponge, Gelfoam, in vivo.

40|$|Injury {{to growth}} plate {{cartilage}} in children {{can lead to}} bone bridge formation and result in bone growth deformities, a significant clinical problem currently lacking biological treatment. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) offer a promising therapeutic option for regeneration of damaged cartilage, due to their self renewing and multi-lineage differentiation attributes. Although some small animal model studies highlight the therapeutic potential of MSC for growth plate repair, translational research in large animal models, which more closely resemble the human condition, are lacking. Our laboratory has recently characterised MSCs derived from ovine bone marrow, and demonstrated these cells form cartilage-like tissue when transplanted within the gelatin sponge, Gelfoam, in vivo. In the current study, autologous bone marrow MSC were seeded into Gelfoam scaffold containing TGF-β 1, and transplanted into a surgically created defect of the proximal ovine tibial growth plate.

40|$|Background—Defining the {{arrhythmogenic}} substrate {{is essential}} for successful ablation of scar-related ventricular tachycardia. The visual characteristics of endocardial ischemic scar have not been described in vivo. The goal {{of this study was}} (1) to quantify the visual characteristics of normal tissue, scar border zone, and dense scar in vivo {{with the use of a}} novel endoscopic catheter that allows direct endocardial visualization and (2) to correlate visual attributes of myocardial scar with bipolar voltage. Methods and Results—Percutaneous transient balloon occlusion (150 minutes) of the mid left anterior descending coronary artery was performed in an <b>ovine</b> model. <b>Animals</b> survived for 41. 50. 7 days. Detailed bipolar voltage maps of the left ventricle were acquired with the use of NavX. Video snapshots of the endocardium were acquired at sites distributed throughout the left ventricle. Visual tissue characteristics of normal (1. 5 mV), border (0. 5 – 1. 5 mV), and dense scar (0. 5 mV) were quantified with the use of image processing. Radiofrequency lesions (10 – 20 W, 30 seconds) were delivered under direct visualization. Mean white-threshold pixel area was lowest in normal tissue (189 96941 478 pixels 2), intermediate in scar border zone (255 97936 016 pixels 2), and highest in dense scar (324 45230 152 pixels 2; P 0. 0001 for all pairwise comparisons). Tissue whiteness, characteristic of scar, was inversely correlated with bipolar voltage (P 0. 0001).

40|$|The {{relationship}} between modern clinical diagnostic data, such as from radiographs or computed tomography, and the temporal biomechanical integrity of bone fracture healing {{has not been}} well-established. A diagnostic tool that could quantitatively describe the biomechanical stability of the fracture site in order to predict the course of healing would represent a paradigm shift in the way fracture healing is evaluated. This paper describes the development and evaluation of a wireless, biocompatible, implantable, microelectromechanical system (bioMEMS) sensor, and its implementation in a large <b>animal</b> (<b>ovine)</b> model, that utilized both normal and delayed healing variants. The in vivo data indicated that the bioMEMS sensor was capable of detecting statistically significant differences (p-value < 0. 04) between the two fracture healing groups as early as 21 days post-fracture. In addition, post-sacrifice micro-computed tomography, and histology data demonstrated that the two model variants represented significantly different fracture healing outcomes, providing explicit supporting evidence that the sensor {{has the ability to}} predict differential healing cascades. These data verify that the bioMEMS sensor {{can be used as a}} diagnostic tool for detecting the in vivo course of fracture healing in the acute post-treatment period. © 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

40|$|Background The growing {{awareness}} of transfusion-associated morbidity and mortality necessitates investigations into the underlying mechanisms. Small animals have been the dominant transfusion model but have associated limitations. This study aimed to develop a comprehensive large <b>animal</b> (<b>ovine)</b> model of transfusion encompassing: blood collection, processing and storage, compatibility testing right through to post-transfusion outcomes. Materials and methods Two units of blood were collected from each of 12 adult male Merino sheep and processed into 24 ovine-packed red blood cell (PRBC) units. Baseline haematological parameters of ovine blood and PRBC cells were analysed. Biochemical changes in ovine PRBCs were characterized during the 42 -day storage period. Immunological compatibility of the blood was confirmed with sera from potential recipient sheep, using a saline and albumin agglutination cross-match. Following confirmation of compatibility, each recipient sheep (n = 12) was transfused with two units of ovine PRBC. Results Procedures for collecting, processing, cross-matching and transfusing ovine blood were established. Although ovine red blood cells are smaller and higher in number, their mean cell haemoglobin concentration is similar to human red blood cells.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the regenerative potential of cell-laden and cell-free collagen matri-ces in comparison to microfracture treatment applied to full-thickness chondral defects in an <b>ovine</b> model. Methods: <b>Animals</b> (n = 30) were randomized into 5 treatment groups, and 7 -mm full-cartilage-thickness defects were set at the trochlea and medial condyle of both knee joints and treated as follows: 2 scaffolds in comparison (collagen I/III, Chondro-Gide®; collagen II, Chondrocell®) for covering microfractured defects (autologous matrix-induced chondrogen-esis), both scaffolds colonized in vitro with autologous chondrocytes (matrix-associated chondrocyte transplantation), or scaffold-free microfracture technique. One year after surgery, cartilage lesions were biomechanically (indentation test), his-tologically (O’Driscoll score), and immunohistochemically (collagen type I and II staining) evaluated. Results: All treatment groups of the animal model induced more repair tissue and showed better histological scores and biomechanical proper-ties compared to controls. The average thickness of the repair tissue was significantly greater when a scaffold was used, especially the collagen I/III membrane. However, none of the index procedures surpassed the others from a biomechanical point of view or based on the histological scoring. Collagen type II expression was better in condylar defects compared to the trochlea, especially in those treated with collagen I/III membranes.

40|$|A genetic {{variant of}} {{foot-and-mouth disease virus}} lacking the leader proteinase coding region (A 12 -LLV 2) is {{attenuated}} in both cattle and swine and, in contrast to wild-type virus (A 12 -IC), does not spread from the initial site of infection after aerosol exposure of bovines. We have identified secondary cells from susceptible animals, i. e., bovine, <b>ovine,</b> and porcine <b>animals,</b> in which infection with A 12 -LLV 2, in contrast to A 12 -IC infection, does not produce plaques; this result indicates that this virus cannot spread {{from the site of}} initial infection to neighboring cells. Nevertheless, A 12 -LLV 2 can infect these cells, but cytopathic effects and virus yields are significantly reduced compared to those seen with A 12 -IC infection. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis demonstrates that both A 12 -LLV 2 and A 12 -IC induce the production of alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) mRNA in host cells. However, only supernatants from A 12 -LLV 2 -infected cells have significant antiviral activity. The antiviral activity in supernatants from A 12 -LLV 2 -infected embryonic bovine kidney cells is IFN-α/β specific, as assayed with mouse embryonic fibroblast cells with or without IFN-α/β receptors. The results obtained with cell cultures demonstrate that the ability of A 12 -IC to form plaques is associated with the suppression of IFN-α/β expression and suggest a role for this host factor in the inability of A 12 -LLV 2 to spread and cause disease in susceptible animals...|$|R

40|$|This study {{characterized}} {{peripheral blood}} mononuclear cells (PBMC) {{in terms of}} their potential in cartilage repair and investigated their ability to improve the healing in a pre-clinical large animal model. Human PBMCs were isolated with gradient centrifugation and adherent PBMC's were evaluated for their ability to differentiate into adipogenic, chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages and also for their expression of musculoskeletal genes. The phenotype of the PBMCs was evaluated using Stro- 1, CD 34, CD 44, CD 45, CD 90, CD 106, CD 105, CD 146 and CD 166 cell surface markers. Osteochondral defects were created in the medial femoral condyle (MFC) of 24 Welsh mountain sheep and evaluated at a six month time point. Four cell treatment groups were evaluated in combination with collagen-GAG-scaffold: (1) MSC alone; (2) MSCs and PBMCs at a ratio of 20 : 1; (3) MSCs and PBMC at a ratio of 2 : 1 and (4) PBMCs alone. Samples from the surgical site were evaluated for mechanical properties, ICRS score and histological repair. Fresh PBMC samples were 90 % positive for hematopoietic cell surface markers and negative for the MSC antibody panel (< 1 %, p = 0. 006). However, the adherent PBMC population expressed mesenchymal stem cell markers in hypoxic culture and lacked CD 34 / 45 positive cells (< 0. 2 %). This finding demonstrated that the adherent cells had acquired an MSC-like phenotype and transformed in hypoxia from their original hematopoietic lineage. Four key genes in muskuloskeletal biology were significantly upregulated in adherent PBMCs by hypoxia: BMP 2 4. 2 -fold (p = 0. 0007), BMP 6 10. 7 -fold (p = 0. 0004), GDF 5 2. 0 -fold (p = 0. 002) and COL 1 5. 0 -fold (p = 0. 046). The monolayer multilineage analysis confirmed the trilineage mesenchymal potential of the adherent PBMCs. PBMC cell therapy was equally good as bone marrow MSC therapy for defects in the <b>ovine</b> large <b>animal</b> model. Our results show that PBMCs support cartilage healing and oxygen tension of the environment was found to have a key effect on the derivation of a novel adherent cell population with an MSC-like phenotype.

40|$|A {{geographic}} information system (GIS) was constructed using remote sensing (RS) and landscape feature data together with Calicophoron daubneyi positive survey records from 197 georeferenced <b>ovine</b> farms with <b>animals</b> pasturing in a 3971 km(2) area of the southern Italian Apennines. The objective was to study the spatial distribution of this rumen fluke, identify environmental features that influence its distribution, and develop a preliminary risk assessment model. The GIS for the study area was constructed utilizing the following environmental variables: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land cover, elevation, slope, aspect, and total length of rivers. These variables were then calculated for "buffer zones" consisting of the areas included in a circle of 3 km diameter centered on 197 farms. The environmental data obtained from GIS and RS and from data taken by the veterinarians on the field (stocking rate and presence of streams, springs and brooks on pasture) were analyzed by univariate (Spearman and ANOVA) and multivariate (discriminant) statistical analyses using the farm coprological status (positive/negative) as the dependent variable. Sheep on 32 of the 197 (16. 2 %) farms, were positive for C. daubneyi, with an average intensity of 52 epg. A multivariate stepwise discriminant analysis model was developed that included moors and heathland, sclerophyllous and coniferous forest vegetation, autumn-winter NDVI and presence of streams, springs and brooks on pasture.

40|$|Abstract Background Cellular {{prion protein}} {{expression}} {{is essential for}} the development of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), and in sheep, genetic susceptibility to scrapie has been associated to PrP gene polymorphisms. To test the hypothetical linkage between PrP gene expression and genetic susceptibility, PrP mRNA levels were measured by real-time RT-PCR in six <b>ovine</b> tissues of <b>animals</b> with different genotypes. Results Previous to the PrP gene expression analysis the stability of several housekeeping (HK) genes was assessed in order to select the best ones for relative quantification. The normalisation of gene expression was carried out using a minimum of three HK genes in order to detect small expression differences more accurately than using a single control gene. The expression stability analysis of six HK genes showed a large tissue-associated variation reflecting the existence of tissue-specific factors. Thereby, a specific set of HK genes was required for an accurate normalisation of the PrP gene expression within each tissue. Statistical differences in the normalised PrP mRNA levels were found among the tissues, obtaining the highest expression level in obex, followed by ileum, lymph node, spleen, cerebellum and cerebrum. A tendency towards increased PrP mRNA levels and genetic susceptibility was observed in central nervous system. However, the results did not support the hypothesis that PrP mRNA levels vary between genotypes. Conclusion The results on PrP gene expression presented here provide valuable baseline data for future studies on scrapie pathogenesis. On the other hand, the results on stability data of several HK genes reported in this study could prove very useful in other gene expression studies carried out in these relevant ovine tissues. </p...|$|R
40|$|In this project, {{we aim to}} use modern {{assessment}} {{techniques to}} study certain {{risk factors related to}} the development of pelvic floor prolapse in a clinical setting as well as in an experimental model. Pelvic floor prolapse is a bothersome condition when the vaginal wall or the uterus protrudes through the vaginal opening. It affects mainly women who were at least once pregnant and delivered vaginally. The project includes clinical part during which we tried to contribute to the discussion on risk factors related to the development of pelvic organ prolapse and other pelvic floor dysfunctions. More extensive, experimental part, aimed to further characterize a large <b>ovine</b> <b>animal</b> model for the development of pelvic organ prolapse and for vaginal surgery. The clinical study was conducted in Prague, Czech Republic, and included a large cohort of nulliparous women who delivered vaginally. One year after delivery one-third of women reported urinary incontinence, 13 % had pelvic organ prolapse reaching the level of hymen or beyond and 3. 3 % reported some anorectal dysfunction mainly related to painful defecation. As a result of delivery, 18 % of women sustained levator ani avulsion and 17 % had levator hiatus ballooning. Both of which were tightly related to the current or future presence of pelvic organ prolapse and its recurrence after surgical correction. Demographic and obstetrical factors included age and body mass index increased the likely hood of urinary incontinence, age increases the risk for pelvic organ prolapse. Risk factors for levator ani avulsion included the forceps delivery, whereas epidural analgesia and perineal rupture grade I was decreasing. Experimentally we worked with the sheep as a large animal model. First, we characterized the pelvic floor of the virgin ewe and compared it to that of women. Second, we documented the effects of certain key life time events such as first delivery, menopause and under its replacement therapy. We identified many anatomical and structural similarities such as vaginal dimensions, the composition of the vaginal wall, attachments of levator ani muscle. Some anatomical structures present in women are not developed in sheep (i. e. the sacrospinous ligament, internal obturator muscle and obturator membrane) and their pelvic floor anatomy is adapted to their quadruped position and presence of the tail. We observed the effect of specific life span factors (first vaginal delivery, ovariectomy, hormonal replacement therapy) on active and passive biomechanical properties of the ovine vagina. Following the first vaginal delivery, ovine vagina became more spacious, its distal part was less stiff and smooth muscles generated lower contractile forces. Following artificially induced menopause vagina was narrower and its middle part becomes stiffer. Estradiol hormonal replacement returned the stiffness in within the range of the premenopausal animal. Histology showed only a limited amount of changes and had not sufficiently explained observed changes in biomechanics. The experimental work was dedicated to studying the effect of novel implants in the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse. In a comparative study, we used a bovine-derived acellular cross-linked collagen matrix (ACM) as an alternative to polypropylene flat meshes. Both types of implants were inserted in the ovine rectovaginal septum. After 6 months, ACMs showed more local graft-related complications and biomechanical properties comparable to polypropylene. Moreover, partial degradation of ACM had a negative impact on smooth muscle contractility. Due to theses observation, we concluded that ACM {{does not seem to have}} better biosafety profile than polypropylene. To proceed with last experimental study in sheep we firstly need to further explore the potential and feasibility of arm anchored implant. In a small study, we performed a trocar guided transvaginal insertion of an H-shaped implant self-tailored to fit ovine anatomy and dimensions. No serious complications were identified therefore we used the technique for bigger prospective study. Moreover, the surgical procedure was recorded for educational purposes. The subsequent study included previously described H-shaped mesh and flat mash, both fabricated from polymeric polyvinidylene fluoride loaded with iron particles that allow its visualization with magnetic resonance (MRI). In a longitudinal manner, we collected data documenting stable shape and position of implants. Initially, there was a drop in the effective surface area observed in both types of implants that remained stable until the end of the observational period. More detail analysis of thickness maps obtained from MRI data revealed two deformations patterns each of them specific for H-shape to flat mesh. Deformation of H-shaped implants was most probably related to distinct biomechanical properties of its central part and arms, whereas flat implants displayed heterogenic pattern most probably linked with pore aggregation caused with suturing. The polymer also showed a low rate of graft related complications, did not affect smooth muscle contractility yet increased the stiffness of augmented tissue. In general, this project has shown that pelvic organ prolapse is linked with maternal age and delivery-related injuries. Up to every eight women may have a symptomatic prolapse already 1 year after her first delivery. Moreover, those with muscle injury are in higher risk of POP development in the future and its recurrence after the primary surgical repair. To improve our knowledge on POP development and treatment we further explored the potential of a large ovine model for prolapse and vaginal surgery. We showed that many anatomical and morphological features and vaginal wall changes induced by specific life span factors (first delivery, artificial menopause, hormonal replacement) are to a certain extent similar to observations in women. We further used this model for testing novel implants and visualization techniques. We believe that the ovine model should be used in future research of pelvic organ prolapse pathophysiology and novel treatment techniques. status: publishe...|$|R
