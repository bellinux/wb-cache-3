50|$|Shintom {{was mostly}} {{well-known}} for designing, selling, and supplying the VHS transport chassis mechanism to various Japanese VHS VCR manufacturers during the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s. Funai Electric (its biggest customer), Sony Corporation, Toshiba Corporation, and Private Label Store Brands joined in. Operations began in 1984 when Funai ordered the chassis mechanisms from Shintom, while assembling VHS players and recorders for several <b>OEM</b> <b>customer</b> brands. This business accounted about 70% of Shintom's total revenue, since Funai was their largest customer. Shintom's original chassis mechanism {{was built to}} industrial-grade, high-reliability standards, since demand for rental video cassette players skyrocketed during the mid-1980s, although most units ended up sold for consumer use. Shintom was also credited for developing the world's first geared-driven VCR dual-idler wheel system, which eliminated the need of a rubber tire found in earlier VHS machines.|$|E

5000|$|Later in 1995, Cyrix {{released}} its best-known chip, the Cyrix 6x86 (M1). This processor continued the Cyrix tradition of making faster replacements for Intel designed sockets. However, the 6x86 {{was the star}} performer in the range, giving a claimed performance boost over the Intel [...] "equivalent". 6x86 processors were given names such as P166+ indicating a performance better than a Pentium 166 MHz processor. In fact, the 6x86 processor was clocked at a significantly lower speed than the Pentium counterpart it outperformed. Initially, Cyrix tried to charge a premium for the Cyrix-claimed extra performance, but the 6x86's math coprocessor was not as fast as that in the Intel Pentium. The main difference {{was not one of}} actual computing performance on the coprocessor, but a lack of instruction pipelining. Due to the increasing popularity of first-person 3D games, Cyrix was forced to lower its prices. While the 6x86 quickly gained a following among computer enthusiasts and independent computer shops, unlike AMD, its chips had yet to be used by a major <b>OEM</b> <b>customer.</b> The game in question causing most problems for performance was id Software's Quake. Unlike previous 3D games, Quake used the pipelined Pentium FPU to do perspective correction calculations in the background while texture mapping, effectively doing two tasks at once. This would not have been a big problem for the 6x86 if, by that time, Quake had a fallback to do perspective correction without the FPU as in, for example, the game Descent. However, id Software chose not to include this. Quake also lacked the option to disable perspective correction, thus eliminating that potential speed boost for FPU-weak CPUs. This potential speed boost would have benefited not just Cyrix's users, but also users of AMD's K5 and especially of the 486. Quakes optimization for the Pentium went beyond FPU usage and catered to a number of other architectural quirks specific to the Pentium, further hindering performance of other CPUs even outside FPU operations. This bias in favor of the Pentium served to boost the popularity of Intel's Pentium CPUs amongst the gaming community.|$|E
30|$|The use of {{recycled}} textiles used in production is a dilemma: the recycled polyester is blended with virgin polyester {{and so the}} resultant fabric does not look different from the non-recycled fabrics, thus raising questions from OEM customers and final vehicle consumers alike {{about the validity of}} the sustainable claims and extra costs. The cost of using recycled yarns appears to be in the processing of the yarn: there is a surcharge/premium in terms of the raw materials which is based on the polyester and not the plastics making it difficult for the <b>OEM</b> <b>customer</b> to understand the costing. The cost implications are, for example, 7 % mark up on fabric that is 40 % recycled and 11 % on fabric that is 100 % recycled; when this is taken back to the yarn, the cost is double or three times that on the normal price of the yarns. According to Ford’s research shared with Sage AI, the premiums charged on recycled yarns varied across the world: 10 % to 15 % (USA), 15 % to 20 % (China, India, Brazil), 20 % to 25 % (Europe), 20 % to 30 % (Korea), and 50 % to 100 % (Thailand).|$|E
30|$|At the {{approaching}} stage, the main knowledge sources for Chinese firms’ frugal innovation are technology spillovers from MNCs from advanced markets (e.g., joint ventures in China, original equipment manufacturers), research output from {{local and global}} universities, and knowledge-sharing in local clusters (Liang 2017). First, international joint ventures provide foreign partners with quick and easy access to new markets by leveraging local partners’ market knowledge and local networks, helping reduce risks and increase revenue. In return, foreign partners bring technological and managerial knowledge and capital (Kim 1997). In transitional economy joint ventures, {{not only is the}} knowledge that each partner brings different, so as the specific knowledge needs (Griffith et al. 2001). Second, original equipment manufacturers (OEM) have acted as training schools for latecomers, enabling them to overcome entry barriers and assimilate manufacturing and design technology (Hobday 1995). Latecomer firms also take advantage of knowledge spillover from <b>OEM</b> <b>customer</b> firms in terms of R&D activities, such that latecomers have the opportunity to move beyond OEM and develop original design manufacturing (ODM), for instance, by engaging in product upgrading (Liu et al. 2013). Third, enterprises embedded in technological clusters can effectively absorb local knowledge through local networks, thus acquiring a unique ability to localize (Wei et al. 2016 g). In a transitional economy, latecomer firms embedded in such clusters face a dilemma: While local innovation networks promote knowledge spillover through collective learning, geographical and cognitive proximity can also lead to a local lock-in effect, which leads to the decline of the cluster.|$|E

40|$|We study {{capacity}} reservation {{contracts in}} high-tech manufacturing, where the manufacturer (the supplier) shares {{the risk of}} capacity expansion with her <b>OEM</b> <b>customer</b> (the buyer). We focus on short-life-cycle, make-to-order products under stochastic demand. The supplier and the buyer are partners who enter a "design-win " agreement to develop the product, and who share demand information. The supplier would expand her capacity in any case, but reservation may encourage her to expand more aggressively. To reserve capacity, the buyer pays a fee upfront while (a pre-specified portion of) the fee is deductible from the order payment. As capacity expansion demonstrates diseconomy of scale in this context, we assume convex capacity costs. We first analyze the players ' incentives {{as a means to}} evaluating the value of reservation. We show that as the buyer's revenue margin decreases, the supplier faces a sequence of four profit scenarios with decreasing desirability. We examine the effects of market size and demand variability to the contract conditions, and show that it is the demand variability that affects the reservation fee, and that the convex cost assumption leads to somewhat different insights than the linear cost cases in the literature. We propose two channel coordination contracts, and discuss how such contracts can be tailored for situations where the supplier has the option of not complying with the contract, and when the buyer's demand information is only partially updated during the supplier's capacity lead time. We conclude the paper by summarizing insights useful for high-tech capacity management. 1...|$|E
40|$|This work is {{performed}} as a pre-study to investigate new business opportunities for companies who are product-centric oriented {{but want to}} move in the direction of being a customer-centric organization by using technologies based on networked products. The study describes IntelliCom, which is a company selling network enabling products. IntelliCom has also developed a customized server solution making it possible to network remote installed products and collect data from these products over Internet. This technology that IntelliCom have knowledge in could be a platform for providing data and different kind of services by connecting customer’s devices, which aim to generate a value for the customer and be a new business opportunity for product-centric companies. The research is mainly based on observations and dialogs with management and sales people of IntelliCom to investigate how the marketing strategies and marketing mix is used when selling products. To be able to collect data and information about the customer’s value and opportunities, I have made an Interview with a potential customer of IntelliCom who is an OEM company already proving products and services in line with a customer-centric business strategy. This customer is Woodward and manufacturer of GenSet controllers within the energy/electrical segment. The observations and information collected from customer were analysed to understand {{and to be able to}} describe how customer’s value chain and smart services opportunities relate to each other. The study shows that the opportunity for IntelliCom to start using the new technology to increasing the sales of data and services, not only products, is good. The study points out that IntelliCom should chose a business model that targeting OEM companies.
