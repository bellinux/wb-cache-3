5000|$|A {{total of}} twelve arched niches are {{embedded}} in {{the walls of the}} western end of the temple, five each lining the north and south walls and another two flanking the door on the west wall. They stand 2.55 m wide by 6 m high and presumably held statues of deities - perhaps the twelve gods of the zodiac. In his novel Metamorphoses, the Roman writer Apuleius described a visit to the temple in which his protagonist [...] "saw the gods infernal and the gods celestial, before whom I presented myself and worshipped." [...] Near the centre of the hall is a shallow basin, 22 cm deep by 5.2 m long, in which three rectangular tubs stood, placed parallel to each other. It had no inflow pipe or drain. The eastern and western halves of the hall are divided by an alabaster-lined water channel, 1.4 m wide and 1.37 m deep, extending the full width of the temple. This did have a substantial inflow or <b>outlet</b> <b>point,</b> 1 m high by 0.45 m wide, which exited somewhere to the west {{in the direction of the}} river. The floor of the temple was constructed from plates of marble and granite imported from as far away as Egypt.|$|E
40|$|Tunnel {{wash water}} is {{frequently}} {{released to the}} river Årungselva through a sedimentation pond. This tunnel wash water may cause harm to the fish through intrinsic and extrinsic toxic effects. A reduction in growth have previously been observed for 0 + brown trout at downstream locations of the sedimentation pond, where fish located below <b>outlet</b> <b>point</b> of the sedimentation pond had a 21 % lower length than fish located above the sedimentation pond. As no reduction in growth were observed prior {{to the establishment of}} the sedimentation pond, the author suggested that the reduced growth could be due to the toxic effect from the tunnel wash water. Since migration and density was not accounted for, it remains enigmatic whether the observed difference was solely due to the suggested toxic effect. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate differences in survival, growth and migration of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) caught above and below the <b>outlet</b> <b>point</b> of the Vassum sedimentation pond in Årungselva. The study was conducted using capture-mark-recapture methodology in combination with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT) telemetry with two antennas. This set-up allowed for estimation of survival, individual growth and migration. In total, 520 individuals were caught by electric fishing. Out of these, 253 individuals were PITtagged from which 75 were resighted at least once during the November 2014 -October 2015 study period. The results show a lower size-adjusted survival in both species for individuals caught below the <b>outlet</b> <b>point</b> compared to those caught above the <b>outlet</b> <b>point.</b> Further, a lower length-at age among 0 + parr of brown trout and 1 + parr of Atlantic salmon, as well as lower length at first-winter for Atlantic salmon parr, were observed for below-individuals compared to above-individuals. The reduced survival and growth rate observed in this study occur despite the fact that fish density is lower at below-sites of the <b>outlet</b> <b>point</b> of the sedimentation pond. Water chemistry variables generally did not vary between above and below sites, apart from chloride, sulphate and uranium that all attained higher below-values. However, other physiochemical variables that vary between above and below <b>outlet</b> <b>point</b> sites may influence growth and survival. In conclusion, fish at below-sites of the <b>outlet</b> <b>point</b> may experience a higher exposure to pollution due to the release of tunnel wash water based on these results. M-ECO...|$|E

50|$|Membrane {{air dryers}} depress the {{incoming}} dew point. Most dryers have a challenge air dew point and pressure specification. So if the inlet dew point {{is lower than}} the specified challenge air then the <b>outlet</b> dew <b>point</b> is even lower than specified. For example, a dryer could be rated at a −40 °F dew point with a challenge of +70 °F dew point and 100 psig.

If the pressure is higher than the rated specification then the <b>outlet</b> dew <b>point</b> will be lowered.

Catchment attributes are utilised to obtain values for conceptual model parameters. This way modelling can take place in an ungauged catchment without the need for stream gauge data to perform calibration. Two hydrological models were used {{as a starting point for}} model development. These were a lumped conceptual rainfall-runoff model (IHACRES) (Jakeman & Hornberger 1993) and a physics-based conceptual groundwater discharge model (Sloan 2000).

SCALE OF CATCHMENT DISAGGREGATION AND MODELLING To disaggregate the catchment into meaningful hydrological units requires manipulation of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) using a number of steps within a Geographic Information System (GIS).

The spring simulation showed that the sea-water intrusion could be prevented through an artificial upraising of the water-outlet point, realized by the construction of a dam.

Consequently, a variety of empirical approaches have been developed which have limited rational validity. Hydrograph synthesis offers a reasonable approach to predicting the outflow hydrograph characteristics. In order to synthesize a hydrograph, it is necessary to mathematically describe the physical behavior of the dynamic processes involved in the hydrologic phenomena. Hydrograph synthesis may be considered to comprise (a) hydrographs (actual or simulated) of precipitation, (b) hydrographs of abstractions such as interception, infiltration, and depressional storage, (c) routing or translating the net rainfall rate (rate of rainfall excess) in finite intervals of time and distances up to the <b>outlet</b> <b>point.</b> The complexities of this routing procedure are many, considering the variable factors such as the shape and size of watershed, soil and vegetative characteristics, nonuniform surface conditions, slopes, and channel geometry.
