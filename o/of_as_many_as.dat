5|$|Capybaras are gregarious. While they {{sometimes}} live solitarily, {{they are more}} commonly found in groups of around 10–20 individuals, with two to four adult males, four to seven adult females, and the remainder juveniles. Capybara groups can consist <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 50 or 100 individuals {{during the dry season}} when the animals gather around available water sources. Males establish social bonds, dominance, or general group consensus. They can make dog-like barks when threatened or when females are herding young.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{cast and}} production changes over the years, Last of the Summer Wine {{continued to be}} popular with viewers and was renewed year after year despite reports to the contrary. Rumours circulated {{as early as the}} 1980s that the BBC wanted to end the show {{and replace it with a}} new programme aimed at a younger audience. Its popularity made this decision hard to justify, however, since even repeats sometimes received ratings <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> five million viewers per episode.|$|E
5|$|Following the Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Popovac joined the Chetnik movement of Draža Mihailović. Popovac was {{a proponent of}} Bosnian Muslim cooperation with the Chetniks and suggested that they recruit Muslims into their ranks. In October 1942, he enlisted Italian aid in fighting the communist Partisans, and later visited Prozor to discourage further bloodshed after a Chetnik massacre that took the lives <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 2,500 Muslim and Croat civilians. In early 1943, he led an attack against a Muslim village. Later that year, {{he was killed in}} disputed circumstances near the town of Trebinje.|$|E

A larger study started by Franciszek Piper used timetables of train arrivals combined with deportation records to calculate at least 960,000 Jewish deaths and at least 1.1 million total deaths, a figure adopted as official by the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum in the 1990s. Piper stated that a figure <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 1.5 million total deaths was possible.|$|E

A 1931 talk was broadcast throughout North America, Australia and France, but his attacks on the clergy resulted in both the NBC and BBC radio networks banning his broadcasts.|$|E
5|$|Scaly-breasted munias form flocks <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 100 birds. Individuals {{communicate}} with calls {{that include a}} short whistle, variations of kitty-kitty-kitty, and a sharp chipping alarm note. They sometimes flick their tails and wings vertically or horizontally while hopping about. The tail flicking motion may have evolved from a locomotory intention movement. The exaggerated version of the tail flicking movement may have undergone ritualization. As a social signal, tail flicking in several other species acts as a signal indicating the intent to fly and helps keep flocks together.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} a {{settlement}} at Northallerton since Roman times, however its growth in importance began in the 11th century when King William II gifted land to the Bishop of Durham. Under the Bishop's authority Northallerton became an important centre for religious affairs. It was also a focus for much conflict in subsequent years between the English and the Scots, most notably the Battle of the Standard, nearby in 1138, which saw losses <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 12,000 men.|$|E
5|$|Bedford Castle {{was a large}} medieval {{castle in}} Bedford, England. Built after 1100 by Henry I, the castle played a {{prominent}} part in both the civil war of the Anarchy and the First Barons' War. The castle was significantly extended in stone, although the final plan of the castle remains uncertain. Henry III of England besieged the castle in 1224 following a disagreement with Falkes de Breauté; the siege lasted eight weeks and involved an army <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 2,700 soldiers with equipment drawn from across England. After the surrender of the castle, the king ordered its destruction. Although partially refortified in the 17th century during the English Civil War, the castle remained a ruin until the urban expansion in Bedford during the 19th century, when houses were built {{across much of the}} property. Today only part of the motte still stands, forming part of an archaeological park built on the site between 2007 and 2009.|$|E

5|$|Bowie {{performed}} {{several of}} the album's songs during a press tour that preceded his highly theatrical Glass Spider Tour, which played to a combined audience <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> six million fans. Bowie wanted to produce a live show that picked up where his aborted 1974 Diamond Dogs Tour left off. Although considered financially successful and well attended, the tour itself was critically dismissed. Bowie designed his next few tours specifically to avoid the problems that the Glass Spider Tour was criticized for by avoiding overly theatrical stage presentations and focusing on his music. Despite the criticism, Bowie maintained that performing on this tour was the most fun he had had on tour {{up to that point}} in his career.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, in 1990, Ted Turner's Goodwill Games {{were held}} in Seattle. News crews at the Pike Place Market {{discovered}} the fish market and its performances with customers, and they filmed them. Soon afterwards, the fish market appeared on Good Morning America, leading to the business and its employees being filmed by various film crews, and being featured in numerous magazines. Now, during the summer tourist season, the fishmongers will perform now in front <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 10,000 visitors daily. The success of the business has been cited to its human resources and employee attitudes. The employees of the fish market will often speak to businesses, civic groups, and schools on ways to be successful, and has led to their being featured in motivational books.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to workers, Schindler moved 250 wagon loads of machinery {{and raw materials}} to the new factory. Few if any useful artillery shells were produced at the plant. When officials from the Armaments Ministry questioned the factory's low output, Schindler bought finished goods {{on the black market}} and resold them as his own. The rations provided by the SS were insufficient {{to meet the needs of}} the workers, so Schindler spent most of his time in Kraków, obtaining food, armaments, and other materials. His wife Emilie remained in Brünnlitz, surreptitiously obtaining additional rations and caring for the workers' health and other basic needs. Schindler also arranged for the transfer <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 3,000 Jewish women out of Auschwitz to small textiles plants in the Sudetenland in an effort to increase their chances of surviving the war.|$|E

5|$|Lek {{systems are}} known to exist among some populations of walruses. These males cluster around females and try to attract them with {{elaborate}} courtship displays and vocalizations. Lekking may also exist among California sea lions, South American fur seals, New Zealand sea lions and harbor seals. In some species, including elephant seals and grey seals, males will try to lay claim to the desired females and defend them from rivals. Elephant seal males establish dominance hierarchies with the highest ranking males—the alpha males—maintaining harems <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 30–100 females. These males commonly disrupt the copulations of their subordinates while they themselves can mount without inference. They will, however, break off mating to chase off a rival. Grey seal males usually claim a location among a cluster of females whose members may change over time. Male harp seals, crabeater seals and hooded seals follow and defend lactating females in their vicinity—usually one or two at a time,—and {{wait for them to}} reach estrus.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{studies have}} {{supported}} monophyly {{in the family}} Bovidae (a group of organisms comprises an ancestral species and all their descendants). The number of subfamilies in Bovidae is disputed, with suggestions <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> ten and as few as two subfamilies. However, molecular, morphological and fossil evidence indicates the existence of eight distinct subfamilies : Aepycerotinae (consisting of just the impala), Alcelaphinae (bontebok, hartebeest, wildebeest and relatives), Antilopinae (several antelopes, gazelles, and relatives), Bovinae (cattle, buffaloes, bison and other antelopes), Caprinae (goats, sheep, ibex, serows and relatives), Cephalophinae (duikers), Hippotraginae (addax, oryx and relatives) and Reduncinae (reedbuck and kob antelopes). In addition, three extinct subfamilies are known: Hypsodontinae (mid-Miocene), Oiocerinae (Turolian) and the subfamily Tethytraginae, which contains Tethytragus (mid-Miocene).|$|E
5|$|The Sind sparrow is gregarious, {{generally}} forming {{small groups}} of four to six birds while feeding. It tends to breed in loose colonies of a few pairs, and non-breeding birds may gather to roost in acacias or tamarisks near water. During winter, the non-breeding season, it forms larger flocks <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 30 birds, and joins flocks with other seed-eating birds, such as house sparrows and red avadavats. The Sind sparrow feeds mainly on the seeds of grasses and other plants such as Polygonum plebeium. It may also forage for insects such as caterpillars, especially to feed nestlings. Flocks forage on flats alongside rivers, flying into nearby bushes and continuing to forage when disturbed.|$|E

5|$|The {{applications}} from Tone intrigued the Directory, which understood that by attacking Ireland {{they would be}} striking at the least defensible part of the British Isles.

Finally and most significantly, a large expeditionary force in Ireland could provide an ideal springboard for an invasion of Britain, especially in combination with a plan then under development to land 2,000 uniformed criminals in Cornwall, who would distract the British Army during the invasion of Ireland and could potentially provide a beachhead for future operations.|$|E
