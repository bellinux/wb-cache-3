The meaning <b>of</b> scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> varies among and within healthcare professions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the concept <b>of</b> scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> for dietetics in Saskatchewan and Canada. Little is known about dietetic scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> in Canada and literature has not shown a consistent use of the term. Saskatchewan is one of two provincial dietetic regulatory bodies without a scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> in legislation. Implications for having an undefined scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> include role confusion, competition among providers, diminishing professional identity and under- or over-utilization of health professionals. 	Using interpretative description methodology, data was collected through four phases. In Phase I, eight provincial dietetic regulatory bodies participated in semi structured telephone interviews on scope <b>of</b> <b>practice.</b> Phase II used an online survey on 92 Saskatchewan dietitians to examine dietetic scope <b>of</b> <b>practice.</b> A follow up online focus group was conducted with ten Saskatchewan dietitians in Phase III to further explore dietetic scope <b>of</b> <b>practice.</b> Phase IV related dietetic scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> statements found across Canada to literature and data collected in Phases I-III. Themes were defined as a topic identified by participants in more than one phase. Data from all phases were coded using NVivo 9. 0. 	Results indicate that dietetic scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> statements are a product of a complex multi-player, political process. Without a scope <b>of</b> <b>practice,</b> Saskatchewan dietitian participants were interpreting their role from a combination of documents (e. g. ethics, research) and stakeholders (e. g. employers and colleagues). Participants believed a dietetic scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> should provide guidance to dietitians, employers, health professionals, the public, regulatory bodies, and other stakeholders. Challenges defining, understanding and working with a scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> include encompassing the diversity of dietetics in a concise statement, and working with stakeholders who have a poor understanding of the dietetic profession. 	Our research also revealed variation in dietetic scopes <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> across Canada. A scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> cycle was proposed which included four phases: no scope <b>of</b> <b>practice,</b> creating a scope <b>of</b> <b>practice,</b> using a scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> and evaluating and updating a scope <b>of</b> <b>practice.</b> Factors influencing a scope <b>of</b> <b>practice,</b> such as the political environment, education of professionals and employer policies all impact this scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> cycle.

The term international emergency medicine generally refers to the transfer of skills and knowledgeincluding knowledge of ambulance operations and other aspects of prehospital carefrom developed emergency medical systems (EMSs) to those systems which are less developed. However, this definition has been criticized as oxymoronic, given the international nature of medicine and the number of physicians working internationally.

40|$|Drawing on the UK {{research}} project, ‘Farmers’ {{understandings of}} GM crops within local communities’, this paper considers {{the application of}} the concepts <b>of</b> communities <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> and networks <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> in the agricultural context. A brief review of theories about communities <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> and networks <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> is given and some of our findings are discussed in the context of those theories. Farmers were found to be a particular type <b>of</b> network <b>of</b> <b>practice,</b> characterised by a weak organisational framework but with a relatively stable network of other communities <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> (or networks <b>of</b> <b>practice)</b> they interact with, which we have called a ‘web of influencers on practice’. Together, farmers’ network <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> and their web <b>of</b> influencers on <b>practice</b> represent the whole environment in which learning may occur, and so provide insights into their social learning system. Most farmers have to work at the boundary of their network <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> and their web of influencers, which creates a significant load on their knowledge management. This is in contrast to other networks <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> where only some members take on this boundary brokering role. The paper concludes that these theories (on networks and communities <b>of</b> <b>practice)</b> provide a useful lens though which to view farmers and their practice, highlighting important points for policy. However, in such contexts these theories need to be extended to include the role of a broader 'web of influencers on practice'. ...|$|R

They are descended from Muslim seafarers who are believed to have arrived on the southeast coast around 1500. Boats carrying Muslim settlers had arrived on Madagascar's shores in the past, but there was a marked uptick in arrivals around this time. Upon arrival they encountered several other Malagasy ethnic groups including the Zafiraminia, who also traced their origins back to Mecca by way of East Africa, although some scholars suggest that the origins of the Zafiraminia was in Sumatra and who had developed a high status among Malagasy communities for the knowledge and technology they had carried with them from overseas, and who had the prerogative <b>of</b> <b>practicing</b> ritual animal sacrifice for the ancestors (sombili), a highly powerful and important rite among Malagasy communities. Oral and written historical traditions of the Antemoro describe their desire to secure marriages between the two communities, but these efforts were rejected by the Zafiraminia. A conflict developed between the two groups for supremacy, which the oral histories of other Malagasy groups describe as a battle between two giants. The conflict evolved as additional Arab settlers arrived and joined with their fellow newcomers to become Antemoro themselves.|$|E
