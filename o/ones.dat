5|$|Adult {{males are}} less ready to pursue and less {{efficient}} at catching than adult females, especially against larger prey. Males are quite effective against small web spiders, and reluctant to tackle large <b>ones</b> although they catch them in about 50% of attempts. Against other jumping spiders, males do not pursue large <b>ones</b> and pursue about 48% of small <b>ones,</b> catching 84% of those they pursue. Males of Portia do not build large webs for catching prey ("capture webs").|$|E
5|$|All Portia species eat eggs {{of other}} spiders, {{including}} eggs {{of their own}} species and of other cursorial spiders, and can extract eggs from cases ranging from the flimsy <b>ones</b> of Pholcus to the tough papery <b>ones</b> of Philoponella. While only P. fimbriata (in Queensland) captures cursorial spiders in their nests, all Portia species steal eggs from empty nests of cursorial spiders.|$|E
