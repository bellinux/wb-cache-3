40|$|Peremptory {{rules in}} {{international}} business transactions The topic of this diploma thesis covers {{the issue of}} peremptory or rather <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> in international business transactions. <b>Overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> are rules which shall apply despite the choice of law made by the parties of the contract. These rules, which are usually of a public nature, serve to implement some crucial public interests and may have important impacts on business relationships. The objective of this thesis is to, firstly, characterize <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> and secondly, to analyze the system of regulation of foreign trade with certain specific kinds of goods, where these rules are typically to be found. This thesis is divided into 12 chapters and also includes a general introduction and a final conclusion. The first chapters aim to provide a complex definition of <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> including one on what distinguishes these rules from public policy. The process of application of these rules based on their origin is examined in detail. The closest attention {{is given to the}} process of applying these rules when {{they are part of the}} law of a third country. The following chapters then focus on an area of law of which the use of <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> is characteristic., i. e. the regulation of [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine {{contractual}} and non-contractual obligations in situations involving {{a conflict of}} law. The special emphasis is given to <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules,</b> the importance and impacts of these rules of law on civil and commercial relations with international element. This thesis is composed of four parts {{and each of them}} is subdivided into further sections and paragraphs. In the first part, we introduce the general theory as theoretical base of the subject and we define the key terms. The question concerning the role of Czech courts in the application of foreign law is also mentioned. Subsequently, we analyze national Czech legislation and we focus on the relevant provisions contained in the draft of new Private International Law Act. By becoming Member State of the European Union in 2004, Czech Republic undertook to accede to the 1980 Rome Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations. Second chapter is dedicated to this international treaty which has clarified the concept of "mandatory rules" but has also given rise to some qualification problems. We discuss the relationship between <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> and protective <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> (particularly rules of consumer and labour law) and present the main approaches to this problem.

40|$|In 2015 the Hague Conference on Private International Law {{adopted the}} Principles on Choice of Law in International Commercial Contracts, a {{non-binding}} set of rules, each complemented by comments and illustrations, {{which may be}} used as a model by national legislators in the reform of their domestic regimes and as a tool for interpreting or supplementing existing rules of private international law. The Principles pursue two fundamental goals: on the one side, they promote and enhance party autonomy; on the other, they aim at increasing the predictability of the law applicable to international commercial contracts. Accordingly, they grant parties wide freedom in the choice of the law governing their transactions, and also include the possibility to opt for non-state rules; they contain provisions on the validity of agreements concerning the choice of the applicable law; they set the limitations to the applicable law resulting from <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> and public policy. In this article, the authors examine the new instrument and assess its impact on both the existing national, international and supranational rules and on the practice in international commercial transactions...|$|R
40|$|The article {{discusses}} the abundance and interaction of rules aimed at determining the law applicable to cross-border consumer contracts. Firstly, it examines {{whether there is}} a continuing need for conflict-of-laws rules that stem from consumer-related directives. It then addresses {{the question of whether the}} Estonian Law of Obligations Act’s conflict-of-laws rules comply with the consumer-related directives. Lastly, the relations between the conflict‑of‑laws rules stemming from consumer-related directives and the Rome I Regulation are analysed. The authors conclude that the level of consumer protection afforded by Rome I seems to allow for a waiver of the various simultaneously existing directive-based conflict rules. Such renunciation would not only resolve the issue of inaccurate transposition to national laws – an apparent problem for the Estonian legislator as well – but also contribute to legal certainty. While the conflict-of-laws rules of Rome I and the national directive-based rules coexist, the latter are to be considered subordinately to Rome I. The conflict rules of the Estonian Law of Obligations Act are deemed to be only domestically mandatory and therefore not to be viewed as <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> in the sense of Article 9 of Rome I...|$|R

40|$|The role of <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> in {{international}} arbitration remains a persistent source of debate. The basic {{problem is a}} straightforward one: contractual arbitration arises {{as a matter of}} the parties’ consent, but the resolution of contractual disputes can implicate <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> of law that are not waivable and are typically designed to protect broader public rights. The literature has often presented the issue in terms of conflict between the authority {{of the state and the}} party-derived authority of the arbitrator. Asserting an independent public duty to protect national mandatory laws as well as the enforceability of arbitral awards, some writers have urged arbitrators to apply a so-called “mandatory rules method” to determine, irrespective of the parties’ agreement, which particular <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> to apply in a particular dispute. This Article takes a skeptical view of the <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> literature and argues that arbitration of <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> is readily handled within the standard, contractual view of arbitration. Advocates of the <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> method rely on a mistaken view of national arbitrability doctrines that, once corrected, deprives the argument of much of its force. The consequences of this insight are nevertheless limited because modern arbitration agreements generally give arbitrators far more authority to apply <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> than many assume. Indeed, applying a special <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> method will typically narrow rather than expand the range of <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> available to the arbitrator. There may be reasons why that narrowing is prudent, but those are not reasons the existing literature has thus far discussed...|$|R
40|$|In this Article, Professor Guzman {{resolves}} {{the tension}} that exists between <b>mandatory</b> legal <b>rules</b> and {{the widespread use of}} arbitration. In recent years, U. S. courts have expanded the range of enforceable arbitration agreements to include agreements that cover areas of law previously thought to be within the exclusive domain of courts. Among the disputes that are now deemed arbitrable are those that implicate <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> such as securities and antitrust laws. Under current law, the willingness of courts to enforce arbitration agreements and to uphold the resulting arbitral awards with minimal judicial review makes it possible for the parties to a transaction to avoid <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> of law. Until now, it has generally been believed that the legal system must either restrict the use of arbitration or permit arbitration and accept that doing so turns all <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> into default rules. This Article proposes a mechanism that permits the continued use of arbitration without abandoning the mandatory nature of legal rules. The recommended approach, called 2 ̆ 2 arbitrator liability, 2 ̆ 2 allows the losing party in an arbitration to sue the arbitrator on the ground that a <b>mandatory</b> <b>rule</b> was ignored. Under existing legal rules, arbitrators have an incentive to ignore <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> of law in favor of the contractual terms agreed to by the parties. Arbitrator liability gives arbitrators an incentive to apply <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> of law. Giving proper incentives to arbitrators will ensure that <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> are enforced, thereby eliminating the incentive for the parties to draft arbitration agreements intended to avoid those rules. The benefits of arbitration can be retained without sacrificing the ability of lawmakers to adopt <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules...</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> and international arbitration. The first facet of this relation is arbitrability, which is now no longer a debated issue since it is recognized in all systems that <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> do not hinder {{the possibility of a}} dispute being settled by arbitration. The second facet relates to the treatment of <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> by arbitrators. The article explores the approach that arbitrators must take to deciding which <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> to apply and how to apply them, including the relations with public authorities. The third facet of the problem is the approach to be taken by the courts in the review of awards involving <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules.</b> It considers the different problems that arise in relation to the review of awards according to the standard of public policy, including the extent and intrusiveness of the review, taking into consideration the primary interest of finality of awards...|$|R

40|$|LL. M. (International Commercial Law) Abstract: Due to {{globalization}} consumers nowadays readily {{enter into}} cross-border transactions, {{and it is}} therefore almost universally acknowledged that these transactions will be governed by the law chosen by the parties, albeit that {{this may not be}} the domestic law of the consumer’s home country. Choice-of-law agreement is an incidence of the doctrine of party autonomy, and in the field of private international law the latter gives expression to the principle of freedom of contract. Party autonomy allows the parties to select the law that will govern their contract, but it is not unrestricted, and is limited to protect the consumer. This is done by, for example the application of <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> statutes. If the consumer legislation in Australia and South Africa are <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> statutes, Australian and South African consumers will be protected. The Australian Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) Schedule 2, commonly referred to as the Australian Consumer Law, is an <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> statute, and cannot be excluded by the foreign law chosen by the parties in consumer contracts falling within the ambit of the Australian Consumer Law. The South African Consumer Act 68 of 2008 is not an <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> statute, but nonetheless protects South African consumers if the consumer contract falls within the ambit of the Consumer Protection Act. This is done by either curtailing the effects of party choice-of-law agreement by preferring the law (whether the chosen foreign law or the domestic law of the consumer’s home country) providing greater protection to the consumer as compared to the other, or by disallowing the parties from waiving the statutory protective measures in the Consumer Protection Act. In Australia and in South Africa both natural persons and, in certain instances juristic persons are protected by the Australian Consumer Law and the Consumer Protection Act, respectively, thus taking the field of consumer protection into the commercial sphere...|$|R

40|$|Abstract__ The Rome I Regulation {{on the law}} {{applicable}} to contractual obligations contains several provisions aimed explicitly at the protection of ‘weaker’ contracting parties, such as consumers and employees. However, in addition to this, the interests of weaker parties are sometimes also safeguarded {{through the application of}} ‘overriding mandatory provisions’, which are superimposed on the law {{applicable to}} the contract to protect a fundamental interest of a Member State. This article is an attempt to clarify {{the extent to which the}} concept of <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> provisions may serve as a vehicle for weaker party protection. To do this, it examines the definition and limitations of the concept and its relation to conflict of laws rules based on the protective principle. Finally, the article seeks to establish whether the doctrine of <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> provisions remains relevant in the case of harmonisation of substantive law at the EU level, for which it will differentiate between full and minimum harmonisation...|$|R

Some continental, particularly German, theorists are more equivocal about whether the public policy and <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> of the governing law of the contract have a similar legitimacy.

The law of the forum determines when a court may or must apply or take into account <b>overriding</b> <b>mandatory</b> provisions of another law. 3. A court may exclude application of a provision of the law chosen by the parties only if {{and to the extent that}} the result of such application would be manifestly incompatible with fundamental notions of public policy (ordre public) of the forum. 4. The law of the forum determines when a court may or must apply or take into account the public policy (ordre public) of a State the law of which would be applicable in the absence of a choice of law. 5.

40|$|For all the {{scholarly}} {{attention paid to}} the role of <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> in civil litigation, the doctrine regarding their use has never been fully developed. Certainly courts considering contracts governed by foreign law will sometimes override that law, applying a <b>mandatory</b> <b>rule</b> of the forum in its place. But in its most expansive articulation, the 2 ̆ 2 <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> 2 ̆ 2 theory would also permit courts in certain circumstances to apply the mandatory law of a third country - a direction in which courts have declined to go. This article examines one of the justifications forwarded by early proponents of this more expansive approach: that ready application of foreign law would promote a form of judicial comity, effectuating the important interests of other nations. It inquires whether the international litigation climate today - in the age of globalization - might be hospitable to further development of the doctrine as a tool of judicial cooperation. It concludes that in fact the current trend is toward a contraction, not an expansion, of the doctrine, in part because forum courts increasingly forego application of even their own mandatory law in favor of party-chosen law. It suggests that arguments favoring broader application of foreign <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> may be inextricably tied to political imperatives and to a base level of substantive similarity between the forum and foreign policies in question, and that for these reasons as well the doctrine will remain limited in scope...|$|R
