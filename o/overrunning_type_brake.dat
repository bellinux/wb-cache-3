50|$|Ada's type {{system is}} not based on a set of {{predefined}} primitive types but allows users to declare their own types. This declaration in turn {{is not based on}} the internal representation of the type but on describing the goal which should be achieved. This allows the compiler to determine a suitable memory size for the type, and to check for violations of the type definition at compile time and run time (i.e., range violations, buffer <b>overruns,</b> <b>type</b> consistency, etc.). Ada supports numerical types defined by a range, modulo types, aggregate types (records and arrays), and enumeration types. Access types define a reference to an instance of a specified type; untyped pointers are not permitted.Special types provided by the language are task types and protected types.|$|R
