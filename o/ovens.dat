5|$|The bakery's {{digitally}} controlled <b>ovens</b> continually adjust temperatures {{to accommodate}} the fermenting and baking processes; these <b>ovens</b> can also bake different types of bread at different temperatures {{on the top and}} bottom of each oven. Despite the emphasis on innovation and automation, Angel's challahs are still braided by hand.|$|E
5|$|Hearths and oblong shaped <b>ovens</b> {{were found}} in a semicircular hut. The white colour of the soil around the hearth and the <b>ovens</b> found at the site pointed to animal meat roasted in the <b>ovens,</b> likely for {{community}} feeding. Rice was a staple food. Mud boundary walls of houses were traced. Burnt chunks of clay with reed or bamboo impressions suggest that houses were destroyed by fire. Houses were larger in size in the Chalcolithic period compared to the Neolithic period, made of reeds and bamboo with mud plaster and flooring of fired earth. A circular hearth and a few post-holes were also found.|$|E
5|$|Selected {{heavy metals}} {{are used as}} {{catalysts}} in fuel processing (rhenium, for example), synthetic rubber and fibre production (bismuth), emission control devices (palladium), and in self-cleaning <b>ovens</b> (where cerium(IV) oxide in the walls of such <b>ovens</b> helps oxidise carbon-based cooking residues). In soap chemistry, heavy metals form insoluble soaps {{that are used in}} lubricating greases, paint dryers, and fungicides (apart from lithium, the alkali metals and the ammonium ion form soluble soaps).|$|E
50|$|Common <b>oven</b> {{temperatures}} (such as terms: cool <b>oven,</b> {{very slow}} <b>oven,</b> slow <b>oven,</b> moderate <b>oven,</b> hot <b>oven,</b> fast <b>oven,</b> etc.) {{are set to}} control the effects of baking in an <b>oven,</b> for various lengths of time.|$|R
50|$|A {{convection}} <b>oven</b> (also {{known as}} a fan-assisted <b>oven</b> or simply a fan <b>oven)</b> is an <b>oven</b> that has fans to circulate air around food. In the Philippines, this type of <b>oven</b> {{is often referred to}} as a turbo broiler.|$|R

The duck {{is placed in the}} <b>oven</b> immediately after the fire burns out, allowing the meat to be slowly cooked through the convection of heat within the <b>oven.</b>|$|R
50|$|A clome <b>oven</b> (or cloam <b>oven)</b> {{is a type}} of masonry <b>oven.</b> It has a {{removable}} door made of clay or alternatively a cast-iron door, and was a standard fitting for most kitchen fireplaces in Cornwall and Devon. The <b>oven</b> would be built {{into the side of the}} chimney breast, often appearing as a round bulge in the chimney. This bulge consisted of the masonry surrounding the <b>oven,</b> and was intended to be dismantled should the <b>oven</b> ever need to be replaced. During installation, they are surrounded by packed clay to prevent the actual <b>oven</b> cracking.|$|R
50|$|In a bakery, angel food cakes {{could be}} baked in a rack <b>oven,</b> {{revolving}} <b>oven,</b> convention <b>oven,</b> or small deck <b>oven.</b> A commercial bakery may use a tunnel or traveling <b>oven.</b> When the cake has finished baking, {{it should have}} a golden brown color on the exposed area. The final volume will generally be {{two to three times}} larger than the batter volume.|$|R
5|$|As {{with all}} {{restaurants}} at Terminal 5, Plane Food cannot use gas equipment due to safety reasons and so electric <b>ovens</b> and hobs are used instead {{as well as}} a single microwave. The cutlery is also a standard airport size so that the knives cannot be used as weapons. Ramsay requires that staff who are working at Plane Food must gain work experience in another one of his restaurants first.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1480s King Richard III instigated the {{construction}} of two gun towers, Bear and Clarence Towers, which were left unfinished on his death in 1485; with their own well and <b>ovens,</b> the towers were an independent stronghold {{from the rest of}} the castle, possibly in case of mutiny by the garrison. With the advent of gunpowder the position of Keeper of the Artillery was created in 1486.|$|E
5|$|Integrated {{circuits}} {{and printed}} circuit boards increasingly feature copper in place of aluminium because of its superior electrical conductivity; heat sinks and heat exchangers use copper because of its superior heat dissipation properties. Electromagnets, vacuum tubes, cathode ray tubes, and magnetrons in microwave <b>ovens</b> use copper, as do waveguides for microwave radiation.|$|E
5000|$|The various {{standard}} phrases {{to describe}} <b>oven</b> temperatures include {{words such as}} [...] "cool" [...] to [...] "hot" [...] or [...] "very slow" [...] to [...] "fast". For example, a cool <b>oven</b> has temperature set to 90°C (200°F), and a slow <b>oven</b> has a temperature range from 150-160°C (300-325°F). A moderate <b>oven</b> has a range of 180-190°C (350-375°F), and a hot <b>oven</b> has temperature set to 200-230°C (400-450°F). A fast <b>oven</b> has a range of 230-260°C (450-500°F) for the typical temperature.|$|R
50|$|The {{function}} of a masonry <b>oven</b> is to trap and radiate heat from a fire, either built within the <b>oven</b> itself or in a firebox that vents into the <b>oven</b> (a white oven); smoke is vented through {{the front of the}} <b>oven,</b> either directly to the outside or through a chimney immediately above the <b>oven</b> door. The front-loading masonry design is somewhat more heat-efficient than an open-topped <b>oven</b> like a tandoor, allowing the use of stored heat and low fires for long bakes instead of requiring a live fire at all times.|$|R

5|$|The Vobster Breach {{colliery}} had {{a unique}} system of long coking <b>ovens</b> which, {{along with the}} other buildings, have been designated as a Scheduled monument. The boiler chimney of Oxley's Colliery near Buckland Dinham which operated for a few years in the 1880s is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|The {{third floor}} is a single, unparitioned room that was likely used for storage. The cellar of the jail has a chimney {{on the west}} that has several <b>ovens,</b> {{including}} a beehive oven, and was not partitioned except for the fieldstone foundation required to support the cells in the southeast corner.|$|E
50|$|The buns {{are then}} baked in a {{cylinder}} like high heat clay <b>oven</b> {{that is similar}} to a tandoori <b>oven.</b> Burning charcoal is put at the bottom to heat the <b>oven.</b> The buns are then stacked one by one from bottom to top of the side of the <b>oven</b> vertically. To remove the finished buns a flat object such as a blunt knife or spatula is used to scrape the bun off of the side of the <b>oven.</b> A colander is then used to catch the buns to prevent it from falling into the charcoal pit {{at the bottom of the}} <b>oven.</b>|$|R

5|$|Urban {{populations and}} the {{military}} preferred to consume their grain {{in the form of}} bread. Mills and commercial <b>ovens</b> were usually combined in a bakery complex. By the reign of Aurelian, the state had begun to distribute the annona as a daily ration of bread baked in state factories, and added olive oil, wine, and pork to the dole.|$|E
5|$|All {{types of}} cooking {{involved}} the direct use of fire. Kitchen stoves {{did not appear}} until the 18th century, and cooks had {{to know how to}} cook directly over an open fire. <b>Ovens</b> were used, but they were expensive to construct and only existed in fairly large households and bakeries. It was common for a community to have shared ownership of an oven to ensure that the bread baking essential to everyone was made communal rather than private. There were also portable <b>ovens</b> designed to be filled with food and then buried in hot coals, and even larger ones on wheels that were used to sell pies in the streets of medieval towns. But for most people, almost all cooking was done in simple stewpots, since this was the most efficient use of firewood and did not waste precious cooking juices, making potages and stews the most common dishes. Overall, most evidence suggests that medieval dishes had a fairly high fat content, or at least when fat could be afforded. This was considered less of a problem in a time of back-breaking toil, famine, and a greater acceptance—even desirability—of plumpness; only the poor or sick, and devout ascetics, were thin.|$|E
5|$|Cleburne {{was born}} in <b>Ovens,</b> County Cork, Ireland, the second son of Dr. Joseph Cleburne, a middle-class {{physician}} of Anglo-Irish ancestry. Patrick's mother {{died when he was}} 18 months old, and he was an orphan at 15. He followed his father into the study of medicine, but failed his entrance exam to Trinity College of Medicine in 1846. In response to this failure, he enlisted in the 41st Regiment of Foot of the British Army, subsequently rising to the rank of corporal.|$|E

The equation can also be expressed as {{a fraction of the}} mass of the water and the mass of the <b>oven</b> dry wood rather than a percentage. For example, [...] (<b>oven</b> dry basis) expresses the same moisture content as 59% (<b>oven</b> dry basis).|$|R
50|$|To use a clome <b>oven,</b> {{one must}} enter the {{fireplace}} and build a fire within the <b>oven.</b> Dried gorse or blackthorn was traditionally used. As the <b>oven</b> has no internal chimney, the smoke is allowed to escape through the <b>oven</b> door, and into the adjacent fireplace where it leaves through the main chimney. Once the <b>oven</b> is white hot, the hot ashes are either raked out or pushed aside, then the baking is put in, and the door propped up to the opening.|$|R

5|$|Nash {{not only}} led Wangaratta to a premiership but, as a favour to a friend, also coached another country side, Greta in 1946, {{leading them to}} a premiership in the <b>Ovens</b> and King Football League, {{becoming}} {{one of the few people}} to have coached two different teams to a premiership in the same season. Nash is still remembered in Greta for placing a football in a cowpat and placekicking it over a tall gum tree.|$|E
5|$|Nash {{trained with}} South Melbourne during the 1946 {{pre-season}} but ultimately retired from VFL football {{to accept a}} position as captain-coach of the <b>Ovens</b> and Murray Football League side Wangaratta for a salary of £12 per week, four times the wage he would have received playing for South Melbourne. The high wage also meant that Nash was not required to find additional employment to cover his family's expenses, and in so doing, {{became one of the}} first fully professional Australian rules football players.|$|E
5|$|New {{settlements}} appearing {{along the}} rivers Mureş, Someş, and Târnava reflects {{a period of}} tranquility in Gepidia until around 568. The common people in Biharia, Cenad, Moreşti, and other villages lived in sunken huts covered with gabled roofs but with no hearths or <b>ovens.</b> They were primarily farmers, but looms, combs, and other products evidence the existence of local workshops. Trading contacts between Gepidia and faraway regions is evidenced by finds of amber beads and brooches manufactured in the Crimea, Mazovia or Scandinavia.|$|E
