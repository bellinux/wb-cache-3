5|$|Emigration {{of young}} people {{continued}} apace with 400,000 Scots, ten per cent of the population, estimated to have left the country between 1921 and 1931. The economic stagnation was only one factor; other push factors included a zest for travel and adventure, and the pull factors of better job opportunities abroad, personal networks to link into, and the basic cultural similarity of the United States, Canada, and Australia. Government subsidies for travel and relocation facilitated the decision to emigrate. Personal networks <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> who had gone ahead and wrote back, or sent money, prompted emigrants to follow.|$|E

40|$|As {{the number}} of older adults in Australia increases, {{attention}} is being directed toward ensuring their good health.  Research suggests that health outcomes of older adults are impacted by social belonging and loneliness, <b>and</b> that <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationship quality is pivotal to wellbeing.  However, the roles <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships in promoting social belonging {{have yet to be}} determined.     Aims: This study investigated if perceptions of social belonging in late adulthood are differentiated by the quality <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships. Method:  The study consisted of two phases.  In Phase 1, 260 university staff and students, aged 18 to 75, completed an online survey investigating the quality <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships <b>and</b> their association with social belonging.  In Phase 2, 88 older adults completed a refined print version of the survey.   Results:  Multiple regression was used to analyse the predictive ability <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships on social belonging. In Phase 1, significant associations were found between both <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships <b>and</b> social belonging, with friendship yielding the strongest relationship.  Interestingly, in Phase 2 the association between quality <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships <b>and</b> social belonging was mediated by age. Those aged 65 to 74 reported a significant relationship between <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> social belonging, which contrasted with those aged over 75.  A significant association between social belonging <b>and</b> <b>family</b> relationships was also found for the entire cohort aged over 65, while high quality friend relationships enhanced social belonging when family relationships were not strong. Conclusions: These results are tentative, but suggest that future research should consider the role that both friendships <b>and</b> <b>family</b> play in promoting social belonging in older adults...|$|R

The self-administered questionnaires were given to 514 students located in Daejeon city during the period from April 1 st to May 31 th, 2010. As a results, the level of depression symptoms was significantly higher in proportion to lower level of social support <b>of</b> <b>families</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends.</b> <b>And</b> the level of depression symptoms was positively correlated with level of social support <b>of</b> <b>families</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends.</b> In multiple regression analysis, the factors of influence with the level of depression symptoms was sex, school grade, academic achievement, friendship with the school fellow, satisfaction of school life <b>and</b> satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>family</b> life. Especially explanatory powers to the level of depression symptoms increased by social support <b>of</b> <b>families</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends.</b> As a conclusion, the level of depression symptoms among high schoo...|$|R

5|$|On June 26, 1953, Cooper {{accompanied}} {{his wife}} and daughter, who were devout Catholics, to Rome, where they had an audience with Pope Pius XII. Cooper {{and his wife were}} still separated at the time, but the papal visit marked the beginning of their gradual reconciliation. In the coming years, Cooper contemplated his mortality and his personal behavior, and started discussing Catholicism with his family. He began attending church with them regularly, and met with their parish priest, who offered Cooper spiritual guidance. After several months of study, Cooper was baptized as a Roman Catholic on April 9, 1959, before a small group <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills.|$|E

5|$|One {{criticism}} of Kohlberg's {{theory is that}} it emphasizes justice {{to the exclusion of}} other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric. Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women. Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends.</b> Men are likely {{to move on to the}} abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved. Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring. Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers, however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.|$|E
5|$|The vernacular {{architecture}} of Scotland, as elsewhere, {{made use of}} local materials and methods. The homes of the poor were usually of very simple construction, and were built by groups <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends.</b> Stone is plentiful throughout Scotland and was a common building material, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. As in English {{vernacular architecture}}, where wood was available, crucks (pairs of curved timbers) were often used to support the roof. With a lack of long span structural timber, the crucks were sometimes raised and supported on the walls. Walls were often built of stone, and could have gaps filled with turf, or plastered with clay. In some regions wattled walls filled in with turf were employed, sometimes on a stone base. Turf-filled walls were not long-lasting, {{and had to be}} rebuilt perhaps as often as every two or three years. In some regions, including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf and straw, rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof. Different regions used turfs, or thatch of broom, heather, straw or reeds for roofing.|$|E

Parang is mostly performed during the Christmas season but is also used at other festivals throughout the year, including the Santa Rosa Festival, the velorio del cruz, and the Sebucan festival. Parang includes both religious and non-religious songs and melodies set against the parang instrumentation. Parang festivities typically involve dancing and there are two primary dance styles, the slower castillian waltz and a quicker gavilan style.|$|E
