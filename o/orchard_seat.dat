6000|$|There is an Eminence,--of these our hills [...] The {{last that}} parleys with the setting sun. [...] We can behold it from our <b>Orchard</b> <b>seat.</b> [...] And, when at evening we pursue our walk [...] Along the public way, this Cliff, so high [...] Above us, and so distant in its height, [...] Is visible, and often seems to send [...] Its own deep quiet to restore our hearts. [...] The meteors {{make of it}} a {{favorite}} haunt: [...] The star of Jove, so beautiful and large [...] In the mid heav'ns, is never half so fair [...] As when he shines above it. 'Tis in truth [...] The loneliest place we have among the clouds.|$|E

Unlike other small villages that are just whitewashed, the buildings in Bordeira are painted with vibrant colours, highlighting the features of each surface. With many small cobble stone roads, orange and lemon trees and fig <b>orchards,</b> the <b>seat</b> resembles a traditional village, {{with some of the}} homes staggered above one another. There is a main café, aptly named Café da Bordeira, that offers light snacks and a limited selection for lunch, while shops and other snack bars cater to the local people. Older buildings have been re-purposed to attract more tourists, including the communal bake oven/house, now been converted into living accommodation.|$|R
5000|$|Olalla {{is a small}} unincorporated {{community}} in Kitsap County, Washington, United States. It is located on Colvos Passage on Puget Sound {{just north of the}} Pierce County county line. Olalla used to be as large as Port <b>Orchard,</b> county <b>seat</b> of Kitsap County. Since the 1870s Olalla has served as one of the commerce centers for the region. The [...] "old town" [...] port located by the Olalla lagoon was made up by many business buildings, most on piers. Shipping and the mosquito fleet (ferrying system at that time) was very busy moving materials, goods and people. All is gone now. Since the Narrows Bridge was built Olalla has enjoyed a quiet rural setting. Since the Second Narrows Bridge it is being converted into a residential community for commuters to nearby cities and towns. Al's Grocery Store is the only old structure left by the lagoon and the locals hold it dear to their hearts.|$|R
