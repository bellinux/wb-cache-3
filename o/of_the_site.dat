50|$|The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Alaska {{district}} surveyed {{and selected}} each one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>sites.</b> It also constructed 11 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original 31 <b>sites.</b> <b>The</b> selection process required that survey teams test the propagation path {{by setting up}} communication towers at each remote site during winter months. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> were easily accessible, but most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> were far from civilization on remote mountain peaks. 14 tons of equipment were taken by dogsled or helicopter to survey <b>the</b> <b>sites.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 2003 and 2004, 31 {{fish species}} {{were found at}} 20 <b>sites</b> in <b>the</b> {{watershed}} <b>of</b> Roaring Creek.

However, redside dace, creek chubsuckers, green sunfish, and fathead minnows were observed in the watershed for the first time during the 2003/2004 survey. The most common game species was wild brown trout, although smaller numbers of brook trout were observed as well. Other game fish in the creek's drainage basin include rainbow trout. smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, and chain pickerel.|$|R

5|$|Herrick's mansion, Greyfriars House, {{remained}} {{in the possession of}} his family until his great-grandson Samuel sold it in 1711. The property was subsequently divided and sold in 1740; three years later, New Street was built across the western part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site.</b> Many burials were discovered when houses were laid out along the street. A townhouse, 17 Friar Lane, was built on the eastern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> in 1759 and survives today. During the 19th century, the site became increasingly built on. In 1863 Alderman Newton's Boys' School built a schoolhouse on part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site.</b> Herrick's mansion was demolished in 1871, the present Grey Friars Street was laid through the site in 1873, and more commercial developments, including the Leicester Trustee Savings Bank, were built. In 1915 the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> was acquired by Leicestershire County Council which built offices on it in the 1920s and 1930s. The county council relocated in 1965 when its new County Hall opened, and Leicester City Council moved in. The rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site,</b> where Herrick's garden had once been, was turned into a staff car park in about 1944, but was not otherwise built on.|$|E

In November 1996 plans for the redevelopment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> were submitted and outline consent was received in May 1997.

40|$|We {{studied the}} field host {{specificity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> microsporidia Thelohania solenopsae and Vairimorpha invictae and their prevalence in the imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta and S. richteri. Terrestrial ants were sampled by using bait traps and/or nest sampling at preselected sites in Argentina and Brazil. The sampling included the genera Solenopsis, Pheidole, Camponotus, Crematogaster, Linepithema, Brachymyrmex, Paratrechina, Dorymyrmex, and Wasmannia. The samples were examined under a phase-contrast microscope for <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> microsporidian infections. <b>The</b> bait trap sampling revealed that: (1) T. solenopsae infected only S. richteri, S. invicta, and Solenopsis sp. at 6 – 67 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> and in 1. 5 – 29 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traps; (2) V. invictae infected only S. invicta at 6 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> and in 3 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> samples. The nest sampling revealed that: (1) T. solenopsae infected S. invicta, S. richteri, and S. macdonaghi, at 41 – 67 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> and in 11 – 58 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colonies; (2) V. invictae infected {{the same species}} at 15 – 50 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> and in 2 – 26 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colonies. We detected T. solenopsae and V. invictae in equal percentages of S. invicta sites (41 %); however, <b>the</b> percentage <b>of</b> colonies infected with V. invictae was 20 % and with T. solenopsae only 11 %. At S. richteri sites, in contrast, T. solenopsae occurred at 46 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> and 15 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colonies and V. invictae occurred at only 15 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> and 2 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colonies.
