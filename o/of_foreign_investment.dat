5|$|The {{colonialism}} that Atangana {{had supported}} was ruinous in Cameroon. Production centred on enriching the chiefs, wooing <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>investment,</b> and the apparatus of colonial administration, and building only that infrastructure that would {{aid in the}} transport and export of cash crops. Nevertheless, Atangana's story became part of Beti folklore. For example, Beti storytellers related his tale in oral poems and songs that took up to a full night to recite. His legacy was largely forgotten by the nation at large between his death and Cameroonian independence. However, the nationalist scholarship that blossomed after Cameroon's independence in 1960 resurrected his story. Charles Atangana Avenue in downtown Yaoundé is named for him. A statue in his likeness tops a hill nearby, which had fallen into disrepair by 2000.|$|E

The features of models considered include partial ownership, bargaining power, multiple investments and capacity constraints. Existing empirical researches <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> direct <b>investment</b> are mostly presented with macroeconomic aggregated data. Our micro survey data offers explanations for purpose <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> direct <b>investment,</b> indicating for either distribution subsidiary, production subsidiary, or both. By distinguishing the purpose of investment, different hypothesis for the effects <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> direct <b>investment</b> on exchange rate pass-through can be tested.

Moreover, <b>foreign</b> direct <b>investments</b> in a European country are shown to affect exchange rate pass-through of other European countries whereas investments in an Asian country do not affect the pricing behavior in other Asian countries. bargaining; exchange rate pass-through; foreign direct investment; horizontal and vertical structure; partial ownership...|$|R
