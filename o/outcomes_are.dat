5|$|Malaria {{is treated}} with {{antimalarial}} medications; the ones used {{depends on the}} type and severity of the disease. While medications against fever are commonly used, their effects on <b>outcomes</b> <b>are</b> not clear.|$|E
5|$|Another {{criticism}} is that <b>outcomes</b> <b>are</b> presented {{in terms of}} relative risk reduction to exaggerate the apparent benefits of the treatment. For example, he writes, if four people out of 1,000 will {{have a heart attack}} within the year, but on statins only two will, that is a 50 percent reduction if expressed as relative risk reduction. But if expressed as absolute risk reduction, it is a reduction of just 0.2 percent.|$|E
30|$|Functional <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> {{assessed}} {{in terms of}} mortality and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) for neurologic disability [10]. Good <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> defined as mRS from 0 to 3, while poor <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> defined as mRS from 4 to 6. Radiological <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> assessed by comparing the midline shift in the preoperative CT and 24 to 96  h postoperatively.|$|R
30|$|Primary <b>outcomes</b> <b>was</b> mean pain {{reduction}} following different treatments regimes. Secondary <b>outcomes</b> <b>were</b> {{adverse effects}} {{due to the}} treatments under study.|$|R

5|$|Birth control also {{improves}} child {{survival in}} the developing world by lengthening the time between pregnancies. In this population, <b>outcomes</b> <b>are</b> worse when a mother gets pregnant within eighteen months of a previous delivery. Delaying another pregnancy after a miscarriage however does not appear to alter risk and women are advised to attempt pregnancy in this situation whenever they are ready.|$|E
5|$|On June 24, WWE {{announced}} {{on its website}} that a supplemental draft would take place on June 25 at noon ET. The supplemental draft, like the previous year, was conducted randomly, with each brand receiving random draft selections. Wrestlers affected by the televised draft were exempt from the supplemental draft. Because professional wrestling is scripted, <b>outcomes</b> <b>are</b> usually predetermined. Unlike years past, during this draft, many employees in WWE were not told whether they were scripted to change brands.|$|E
5|$|Prognostic {{factors in}} NSCLC include {{presence}} of pulmonary symptoms, large tumor size (>3cm), nonsquamous cell type (histology), degree of spread (stage) and metastases to multiple lymph nodes, and vascular invasion. For people with inoperable disease, <b>outcomes</b> <b>are</b> worse {{in those with}} poor performance status and weight loss of more than 10%. Prognostic factors in small cell lung cancer include performance status, gender, stage of disease, and involvement of {{the central nervous system}} or liver at the time of diagnosis.|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} W-Beijing {{genotype}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis on treatment <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> evaluated in 249 newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients. No {{significant difference in}} the treatment <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> found between the W-Beijing and non-W-Beijing groups.

50|$|Therefore, {{the term}} {{learning}} <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> replacing objective in some educational organisations. In some organisations the term learning <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> {{used in the}} part of a course description where aims are normally found. One can equate aims to intended learning outcomes and objectives to measured learning outcomes. A third category of learning <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> the unintended learning outcome which would include beneficial <b>outcomes</b> that <b>were</b> neither planned nor sought but are simply observed.|$|R
5|$|Retinopathy of {{prematurity}} (ROP) {{in infants}} frequently regresses without intervention and eyesight may be normal in later years. Where {{the disease has}} progressed to the stages requiring surgery, the <b>outcomes</b> <b>are</b> generally good {{for the treatment of}} stage 3 ROP, but are much worse for the later stages. Although surgery is usually successful in restoring the anatomy of the eye, damage to the nervous system by the progression of the disease leads to comparatively poorer results in restoring vision. The presence of other complicating diseases also reduces the likelihood of a favourable outcome.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is {{large quantities of}} intravenous fluids. Other treatments may include dialysis or hemofiltration in more severe cases. Once urine output is established sodium bicarbonate and mannitol are commonly used but they are poorly supported by the evidence. <b>Outcomes</b> <b>are</b> generally good if treated early. Complications may include high blood potassium, low blood calcium, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and compartment syndrome.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} makes choices {{throughout}} the game, the gameplay's plot is revealed. Besides affecting dialogue and story developments, {{the outcome of}} entire scenes (and in some cases, the outcome of scenes several chapters later) can be manipulated {{to a certain extent}} based on player choices. These choices are typically moral decisions made through Jodie's dialogue options, interventions with various characters, success or failure in her combat scenes, or psychic actions that the player chooses to have Aiden perform. Examples of choice-based <b>outcomes</b> <b>are</b> the chapter titled The Party, where the player is given the choice of unleashing brutal revenge toward a group of bullies or simply running away, and the chapter titled The Embassy, where the player can either engage in psychic information retrieval or can jeopardize the mission by forcing one of the guards to commit suicide. Choices also determine the finale of Beyond: Two Souls, as any number of possible plot endings can be experienced by the player.|$|E
30|$|Early death, {{relatively}} high in-hospital mortality, and poor functional <b>outcome</b> <b>are</b> common in Ugandans who experience acute stroke.

5|$|Of {{all people}} with lung {{cancer in the}} US, 16.8% survive {{for at least five}} years after diagnosis. In England and Wales, between 2010 and 2011, overall five-year {{survival}} for lung cancer was estimated at 9.5%. <b>Outcomes</b> <b>are</b> generally worse in the developing world. Stage is often advanced at the time of diagnosis. At presentation, 30–40% of cases of NSCLC are stage IV, and 60% of SCLC are stage IV. Survival for lung cancer falls as the stage at diagnosis becomes more advanced: the English data suggest that around 70% of patients survive at least a year when diagnosed at the earliest stage, but this falls to just 14% for those diagnosed with the most advanced disease.|$|E
5|$|Further {{treatment}} for other complications such as seizure, hypotension, cardiac abnormalities, pulmonary edema, and acidosis may be required. Increased muscle activity and seizures {{should be treated}} with dantrolene or diazepam; diazepam should only be given with appropriate respiratory support. Hypotension requires treatment with intravenous fluids; vasopressors {{may be required to}} treat myocardial depression. Cardiac dysrhythmias are treated with standard advanced cardiac life support protocols. If severe, metabolic acidosis is treated with sodium bicarbonate. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate is controversial as acidosis may increase tissue oxygen availability. Treatment of acidosis may only need to consist of oxygen therapy. The delayed development of neuropsychiatric impairment {{is one of the most}} serious complications of carbon monoxide poisoning. Brain damage is confirmed following MRI or CAT scans. Extensive follow up and supportive treatment is often required for delayed neurological damage. <b>Outcomes</b> <b>are</b> often difficult to predict following poisoning, especially people who have symptoms of cardiac arrest, coma, metabolic acidosis, or have high carboxyhemoglobin levels. One study reported that approximately 30% of people with severe carbon monoxide poisoning will have a fatal outcome. It has been reported that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may increase the likelihood of delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) after carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Outcome {{reporting}} bias {{is related to}} publication bias and selection bias, in which multiple <b>outcomes</b> <b>are</b> measured but only the significant <b>outcomes</b> <b>are</b> reported, while insignificant or unfavorable <b>outcomes</b> <b>are</b> ignored.|$|E
5000|$|Strict {{stationary}} equilibria: A Nash equilibrium {{is called}} strict if each player strictly prefers the infinite sequence of outcomes attained in equilibrium, over any othe sequence he can deviate to. A Nash equilibrium is called stationary if the <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> {{the same in}} each time-period. An <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> attainable in strict-stationary-equilibrium if-and-only-if for every player the <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> strictly better than the player's minimax outcome.|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish a self-defeating prophecy from a self-fulfilling prophecy that predicts a negative outcome. If a prophecy of a negative <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> made, and that negative <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> achieved {{as a result of}} positive feedback, then it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, if a group of people decide {{they will not be able}} to achieve a goal and stop working towards the goal as a result, their prophecy was self-fulfilling. Likewise, if a prediction of a negative <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> made, but the <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> positive because of negative feedback resulting from the rebellion, then that is a self-defeating prophecy.|$|R

30|$|Our primary <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> {{cardiovascular}} mortality. Secondary <b>outcomes</b> <b>were</b> total mortality, myocardial infarction, CABG and PCI procedures.

We chose not to use a combined endpoint for analysis, as although it may have increased the statistical power required to detect treatment effects, it can also be problematic in interpretation and generate misleading conclusions, particularly about the strength of reductions in mortality [20, 21]. For this reason, the results of each <b>outcome</b> <b>are</b> presented separately.|$|R
