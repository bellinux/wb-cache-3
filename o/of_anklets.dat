In this dance participants make extremely fast moves while making vigorous ring forms in tune to the music or song sung by the group. Both men and women participate in the dance. Twelve different types of 'steps' are executed. The beauty of the intricate footwork is heightened by the tinkling <b>of</b> <b>anklets</b> and bells and also by the rhythmic clapping of hand. The whirling movements become faster as the dancing reaches a climax. This dance is performed during the Onam festival season very often. The dance is also called Chuvadukali or Chavittukali.|$|E

5000|$|Ray had {{initially}} planned {{to make a}} film on Bala in 1966 when she was in her prime. However, he could only start filming in 1976.

When Ray filmed then 58-year-old Bala for the documentary, she found to be wearing same pair <b>of</b> <b>anklets</b> which she wore more than fifty years ago for her debut performance, at the age of seven.

40|$|All living beings {{born in this}} {{beautiful}} world have their own life styles. Have you observed and analyzed your daily life from the view point of a chemist? Chemical reactions happen around {{us all the time}} and even in our body. Any change can be classifi ed as physical change and chemical change. Physical changes can be easily reversed but, {{it is not easy to}} reverse a chemical change. What is the reason? In chemical changes, new substances are formed and it is diffi cult to regenerate the original substances. Chemical changes are more permanent than physical changes. All chemical changes are accompanied by chemical reactions. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction has taken place? Let us perform some activities to fi nd out the answer to this question. The lustrous white colour <b>of</b> the silver <b>anklet</b> slowly changes into slightly black colour. That is, silver anklet has got tarnished. Can you guess the reason behind it? It is due to the formation of silver sulphide (Ag 2 S), as a result of the reaction between silver and hydrogen sulphide in the air.

50|$|Dhimsa had {{branched}} off {{to eight}} different categories of dances. Boda Dimsa is a worship dance {{in honour of}} village goddess. Men {{on the right and}} women on the left form two rows and hold one another firmly in their hands the backs. The first man in the right row with a bunch of peacock feathers in hand in rhythmical steps takes the lead while the last person in the left row joins him. Then all dancers to the sounds <b>of</b> <b>anklets</b> move zigzag in a serpent dance in a circle crying “Hari” and “Hui” return to the rows. In Gunderi dimsa or Usku Dimsa a male dancer while singing sends invitation to the females to dance with him. Thereafter, the male and female with firm steps move forward and backward stride in a circle. In Goddi Beta Dimsa the dancers bending forward and rising up with a swing go about twenty-five steps and return in the same manner four to five times. Potar-Tola Dimsa dance symbolizes the picking up leaves. Half of the dancers stand side by side in a row, while the rest stand behind the first row in same manner and keep their hands on shoulders of dancers standing before. Turning their heads to right and left the two rows march forward and backward. Bhag Dimsa is a dance of art as to how to escape from a tigers attack. Half of the dancers form a circle holding hand in hand. They stand on their toes, bowing and raising their heads. Moving round swiftly, the rest enter the circle and form a “serpent Coil”. This is repeated several times. Natikari Dimsa is a solo dance danced by the Valmikis on Dewali festival in particular. Kunda Dimsa is dance where the dancers push each other with their shoulders while swinging rhythmically. Baya Dimsa dance is the dance of tribal magician when he is possessed by the village goddess. All the villagers with their hands bowed down imitate the “Ganachari”. This continues till the magician returns to normalcy Dimsa dances exhibit community unity without discrimination. These dance forms essentially amplifying their ways of life belong to their cultural heritage. Even though things have changed much, yet the hillmen had retained their traditions unspoilt. Though their dances cannot be included into any classical forms, yet they conform to the rhythm of either “Aditala” or “Rupakatala”.|$|E
5000|$|Ravi (Vijayakumar) is {{happily married}} to Savitri (Latha). Savitri’s brother Ramesh (Rajinikanth) {{has come from}} Singapore, and they all go to Ravi’s estate for a vacation. And that night starts Savitri’s terrible ordeal. An {{apparition}} is visible only to her eye; an eerie song and the sound <b>of</b> <b>anklets</b> make themselves heard only to her ears. And before she realizes what is happening, another spirit enters her body, driving out her own spirit! Overnight Savitri’s persona itself changes; she talks, walks and behaves like a different woman. Ramesh is puzzled at the change, and keeps a watch on her. He follows her, as she wanders all over the hills with the easy familiarity {{of a person who}} has lived there all her life. He sees her shed tears over two names carved on a tree trunk; the fading legends [...] "Radha" [...] and [...] "Ravi" [...] tell the tragic tale of love and loss. He follows her as he goes to a humble cottage and eavesdrops as she introduces herself to the incredulous old woman (Pushpalatha) as her dead daughter Radha. It was only due to her unrequited love that she was hovering as a banshee so far, she explains. She tells excitedly that in the 5 days before new moon, if she can have a physical union with Ravi even once, she would be alive again. And if she didn’t succeed? Well, she would push Ravi down the same waterfall where she had met her end, so that they could unite in the other world. In the old disused bungalow of Ravi, Ramesh sees a picture of Radha and listens to a cassette as well. He confronts Ravi with the photo, and Ravi tells all- how {{he fell in love with}} Radha (Padmapriya), the daughter of the late factory supervisor. They roamed all over the hills, even as the lofty knolls were passive spectators to their love. With steadfast determination, Ravi manages to get his father’s (VSR) acceptance. But when he rushes back with the happy tidings, he finds only her body- she had met a watery grave trying to escape from the clutches of her evil suitor Ranga (Kannan). Armed with the facts now, Ramesh thwarts off the attempts of the possessed Savitri’s attempts to sleep with Ravi. The first night she dresses provocatively and sings a song of seduction in the bedroom. Ramesh knocks the door and pulls Ravi out telling him that there was a call that the factory is on fire. And the second night, he dissolves some strong sedatives in Ravi’s glass of milk. The third morning, in the labour day gathering where they are special invitees, the transformed Savitri dances and sings with abandon. That night, she takes Ravi to their summer cottage, but her plan goes awry again when Ramesh sets it on fire. On the next night, Ravi is returning home when Ranga waylays him to settle old scores and hits him on the head. Ramesh rescues him in time. Of course, that night too passes without Radha’s schemes seeing success. The last night, its do or die for Radha, and so she puts the vigilant Ramesh to sleep and lures Ravi out with a soft song of invitation. Savitri’s displaced spirit crying out ‘Anna! Anna!’ and the barking dog wake up Ramesh and soon he is in pursuit as Radha sings and leads Ravi up the hill. In the end, good triumphs over evil.|$|E
40|$|Background: Foreign body (FB) {{ingestion}} is {{a frequent}} gastrointestinal emergency in pediatric population. Improvement in endoscopic techniques and equipment enables nonsurgical management in most situations. Recent data from India on pediatric FB ingestion have been lacking. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the profile and outcome after endoscopic management of patients < 18 years of age presenting with FB ingestion. Patients and Methods: Records of all the children with FB ingestion who had undergone endoscopic removal at our institution during 5 years (2011 – 2016) were assessed retrospectively. The nature of FB ingested, and success and complication of endoscopic therapy were analyzed. Results: There were 150 pediatric endoscopies during the study period. Of this, 120 (80 %) were for removal of ingested FB. Most common (MC) FB was coin (69 %). The retrieved FBs were 83 coins, 13 batteries, 5 pins, 4 clips, 2 each <b>of</b> <b>anklets,</b> keys, marbles, and seeds, one each of spoon, blade, spanner, peanut, toe ring, and a pencil. One had trichobezoar. Esophagus was the MC site of location of FB (85 / 120). FB removal was successful by flexible endoscopy in 97. 1 %. Four (0. 03 %) cases were referred for rigid endoscopic/surgical removal by otolaryngologists/pediatric surgeon. Except for one child developed bronchopneumonia, there was no morbidity or mortality in the study. Conclusion: Endoscopic removal of FB is a safe procedure with excellent outcomes in a specialized gastroenterology unit...|$|E
