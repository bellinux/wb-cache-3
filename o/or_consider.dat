5|$|Before a {{property}} is {{inscribed on the}} List of World Heritage in Danger, its condition is assessed and a potential programme for corrective measures is developed {{in cooperation with the}} State Party involved. The final decision about inscription is made by the committee. Financial support from the World Heritage Fund may be allocated by the committee for listed properties. The state of conservation is reviewed on a yearly basis, after which the committee may request additional measures, delete the property from the list if the threats have ceased <b>or</b> <b>consider</b> deletion from both the List of World Heritage in Danger and the World Heritage List. Of the two Former UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Dresden Elbe Valley was delisted after placement on the List of World Heritage in Danger while the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary was directly delisted. As of 2017, there are 54 entries (17 natural, 37 cultural) on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Some sites have been designated as World Heritage Sites and World Heritage in Danger in the same year, such as the Church of the Nativity, traditionally considered to be the birthplace of Jesus. Arranged by the UNESCO regions 22 of the listed sites are located in the Arab States (of which 7 are located in Syria and 5 in Libya), 15 in Africa (of which 5 are in the Democratic Republic of the Congo), 7 in Latin America and the Caribbean, 6 in Asia and the Pacific, and 4 in Europe and North America (all by 2017). The majority of the endangered natural sites (11) are located in Africa.|$|E

25|$|There are {{separate}} movements and organizations who hold to classical Unitarian or Christian Universalist Christian theology {{and do not}} belong to the Unitarian Universalist Association <b>or</b> <b>consider</b> themselves UUs. The American Unitarian Conference and the Christian Universalist Association are the two most significant organizations representing these theological beliefs today. Christians who hold these beliefs tend to consider themselves the true Unitarians or Universalists and heirs of the theological legacy of the original American Unitarian Association or Universalist Church of America, and they do not wish to be confused with UUs and UUism. The Unity Church is another denomination that is often confused with Unitarian Universalism.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary Hinduism can be {{categorized}} into four major traditions: Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism, and Smartism. Vaishnavism, Shaivism, and Shaktism worship Vishnu, Shiva, and Devi — the Divine Mother — as the Supreme respectively, <b>or</b> <b>consider</b> all Hindu deities as aspects of the formless Supreme Reality or Brahman. Other minor sects such as Ganapatya and Saura focus on Ganesha and Surya as the Supreme. A sub-tradition within the Vaishnavism school of Hinduism that is an exception is dualistic Dvaita, founded by Madhvacharya in the 13th-century (where Vishnu as Krishna is a monotheistic God). This tradition posits a concept of monotheistic God so similar to Christianity that Christian missionaries in colonial India suggested that Madhvacharya was likely influenced by early Christians who migrated to India, a theory that has been discredited by scholars.|$|E

25|$|By December 2010, Inter had slumped to {{sixth in}} Serie A, 13 points adrift {{of the top}} (although Inter played two games less), having {{suffered}} consecutive defeats against arch rivals Milan (which ended a 46 match unbeaten home record), Chievo and Lazio, as well as losing at Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League, leading to speculation that Benítez's position was under threat. Despite criticism, Benítez guided Inter to win the FIFA Club World Cup in December 2010. Buoyed by the Club World Cup victory, he told the European champions to back him with new signings <b>or</b> <b>consider</b> whether they wanted to keep him as coach, despite the side having won the treble {{only a few months}} earlier. Benítez's demands were dismissed out of hand by the Inter ownership, with Massimo Moratti refusing to comment Benítez's continued employment by the club. On 23 December, Benítez was dismissed by Inter.|$|E
25|$|Another {{potential}} {{factor that}} led to the crash of the 737 aircraft was the power control unit (PCU) that controlled the aircraft's rudder. The cause of some 737 crashes such as USAir Flight 427 had been attributed to the 737's rudder issues. Although the NTSB and PCU manufacturer Parker Hannifin had already determined that the PCU was properly working, and thus not the cause of the crash, a private investigation into the crash for a civil lawsuit tried by jury in a California state court in Los Angeles, which was not allowed to hear <b>or</b> <b>consider</b> the NTSB's and Parker Hannifin's conclusions, decided that the crash was caused by a defective servo valve inside the PCU, based on forensic findings from an electron microscope which determined that minute defects within the PCU had caused the rudder hard-over and a subsequent uncontrollable flight and crash. The manufacturer of the aircraft's rudder controls and the families later reached an out-of-court settlement.|$|E

500|$|At the {{national}} convention of 1973, the issues presented by Title IX were discussed by the Grand Chapter. The jurisdiction committee considered several options {{that would bring}} the fraternity into compliance, but were not receptive of the general idea. At the insistence of committee chair Richard Adler, from the Nu chapter at the University of Michigan, the jurisdiction committee presented the Grand Chapter with an amendment [...] "without prejudice"—that is, without recommendation for or against the amendment—that would strike {{the section of the}} constitution that read, [...] "All members of the Fraternity shall be of the male sex." [...] The committee simultaneously recommended that the delegation take no action to change the constitution <b>or</b> <b>consider</b> a merger with Tau Beta Sigma. The amendment was defeated, and a separate amendment was proposed and approved that changed the wording to say, [...] "All active, alumni, inactive, and life members of the Fraternity be of the male sex." [...] This amendment was approved, allowing the fraternity to initiate women as honorary members.|$|E
500|$|The {{first point}} follows from basic {{properties}} of the real numbers: L has a supremum and R has an infimum, which are easily seen to be equal; being a real number it either lies in R or in L, but not both since L and R {{are supposed to be}} disjoint. The second point generalizes the 0.999.../1.000... pair obtained for p1="0", p2="1". In fact one need not use the same alphabet for all positions (so that for instance mixed radix systems can be included) <b>or</b> <b>consider</b> the full collection of possible strings; the only important points are that at each position a finite set of symbols (which may even depend on the previous symbols) can be chosen from (this is needed to ensure maximal and minimal choices), and that making a valid choice for any position should result in a valid infinite string (so one should not allow [...] "9" [...] in each position while forbidding an infinite succession of [...] "9"s). Under these assumptions, the above argument shows that an order preserving map from the collection of strings to an interval of the real numbers cannot be a bijection: either some numbers do not correspond to any string, or some of them correspond to more than one string.|$|E

500|$|Scalia {{calls the}} Court's {{conclusion}} {{to hear the}} case [...] "patently erroneous". His first argument relies {{on the part of the}} Detainee Treatment Act (DTA) (effective December 30, 2005) that states [...] "o court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear <b>or</b> <b>consider</b> an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba." [...] §1005(e)(1), 119 Stat. 2742. Scalia's opinion is that this clause suffices to deny the Supreme Court jurisdiction over the case, calling the majority's reading [...] of the effectiveness provisions of §1005(h), a [...] "mess". He cites Bruner v. United States and other cases granting [...] "immediate effect in pending cases, absent an explicit statutory reservation". He wrote that in interpreting the language in the DTA, the majority ignored Supreme Court precedents which established that a statute excluding jurisdiction applies to pending cases unless it has clear language saying it does not. Scalia claimed that the majority had made this interpretation [...] "for the flimsiest of reasons". He was referring to the majority's use of Senate floor debate records to bolster their interpretation, writing that it [...] "makes no difference" [...] that the language in support of his position was inserted into the Congressional Record after the law was voted upon. He also accuses the majority of ignoring the President's Signing Statement.|$|E
500|$|Article 25(1) of the Indian Constitution, {{which is}} in the same terms as in Article 15(1) of the Singapore Constitution, {{guarantees}} to individuals the right to freely [...] "profess, practise and propagate" [...] their religions. The term propagate was considered by the Supreme Court of India in Stanislaus v. State of Madhya Pradesh (1977). The Court adopted a dictionary definition of propagate, which was [...] "to transmit or spread from person to person or from place to place". Accordingly, it held that the word as used in Article 25(1) confers on an individual the right to transmit or spread one's religion by an exposition of its tenets. In other words, an individual has the right to spread his or her religion by explaining to others the principles and beliefs underlying that particular religion. However, in the Court's opinion Article 25(1) does not confer the right to convert another person who holds a pre-existing religious belief to one's own religion as this would impinge on the [...] "freedom of conscience" [...] provided for in the Article, which accords each individual with the freedom to hold <b>or</b> <b>consider</b> a thought, fact or viewpoint independent from those of others. In short, the constitutional right to propagate one's own religion is protected insofar as an individual who exercises this right respects the freedom of persons following other religions. The Indian jurist Hormasji Maneckji Seervai has criticized Stanislaus and has said it should be overruled. He argued that when a person propagates his religion to another, that act does not violate the other person's free conscience but allows that person an opportunity to freely choose a religion: ...|$|E
