DRIE was carried out using an anodically bonded silicon wafer as an etching mask. We controlled the groove profile, namely improving its sidewall angle, by removing excessively thick polymer film produced by carbonfluoride etching gases during DRIE. Two fabrication processes were experimentally compared for effective removal of the film : DRIE {{with the addition of}} argon to the etching gases and a novel combined process in which DRIE and subsequent ultrasonic cleaning in DI water were alternately carried out. Both processes improved the sidewall angle, and it reached 85 <b>o</b> <b>independent</b> of the mask-opening width. The results showed the processes can remove excessive polymer film on sidewalls.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of hardware virtualization technology {{has led to}} the development of <b>OS</b> <b>independent</b> malware such as the Virtual Machine based rootkits (VMBRs). In this paper, we draw attention to a different but related threat that exists on many commodity systems in operation today: The System Management Mode based rootkit (SMBR). System Management Mode (SMM) is a relatively obscure mode on Intel processors used for low-level hardware control. It has its own private memory space and execution environment which is generally invisible to code running outside (e. g., the Operating System). Furthermore, SMM code is completely non-preemptible, lacks any concept of privilege level, and is immune to memory protection mechanisms. These features make it a potentially attractive home for stealthy rootkits. In this paper, we present our development of a proof of concept SMM rootkit. In it, we explore the potential of System Management Mode for malicious use by implementing a chipset level keylogger and a network backdoor capable of directly interacting with the network card to send logged keystrokes to a remote machine via UDP. The rootkit hides its memory footprint and requires no changes to the existing Operating System. It is compared and contrasted with VMBRs. Finally, techniques to defend against these threats are explored. By taking an offensive perspective we hope to help security researchers better understand the depth and scope of the problems posed by an emerging class of <b>OS</b> <b>independent</b> malware...|$|E
40|$|As a novel {{approach}} to software maintenance in large clusters of PCs requiring multiple OS installations we implemented partition cloning and partition repositories {{as well as a}} set of <b>OS</b> <b>independent</b> tools for software maintenance using entire partitions, thus providing a clean abstraction of all operating system configuration state. We identify the evolution of software installations (different releases) and the customization of installed systems (different machines) as two orthogonal axes. Using this analysis we devise partition repositories as an efficient, incremental storage scheme to maintain all necessary partition images for versatile, large clusters of PCs. We evaluate our approach with a release history of sample images used in the Patagonia multi-purpose clusters at ETH Zürich including several Linux, Windows NT and Oberon images. The study includes quantitative data that shows the viability of the <b>OS</b> <b>independent</b> approach of working with entire partitions and investigates some relevant tradeoffs: e. g., between difference granularity and compression block size. For a 2 GByte Windows NT partition our repository system enables the storage of nearly a dozen generational images or several dozens of customized images within the storage budget of twice the image size. The partitions can be replicated and transferred to a large number of PCs with our Dolly cloning tool. At present, our system is a modular university prototype based entirely on open source software, and most parts of it are in daily use to maintain our CoPs and Patagonia clusters at ETH. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A key {{criterion}} in {{the design}} of high-speed networks is the probability that the buffer content exceeds a given threshold. We consider <b>Ò</b> <b>independent</b> identical traffic sources modelled as point processes, which are fed into a link with speed proportional to Ò. Under fairly general assumptions on the input processes we show that the steady state probability of the buffer content exceeding a threshold � � tends to the corresponding probability assuming Poisson input processes. We verify the assumptions for a large class of long-range dependent sources commonly used to model data traffic. Our results show that with superposition, significant multiplexing gains can be achieved for even smaller buffers than suggested by previous results, which consider Ç Ò buffer size. Moreover, simulations show that for realistic values of the exceedance probability and moderate utilisations, convergence to the Poisson limit takes place at reasonable values of the number of sources superposed. This is particularly relevant for high-speed networks in which the cost of high-speed memory is significant.

40|$|Paleoclimate {{records of}} {{geologic}} time periods characterized by extreme global warmth {{such as the}} mid-Cretaceous are important for {{a better understanding of}} the Earth's climate system operating in an exceptionally warm mode. Here we applied an organic geochemical proxy (TEX 86) on organic matter-rich Albian-Santonian sediments, recovered from Ocean Drilling Program Leg 207 Sites 1258 and 1259 on Demerara Rise, to reconstruct sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the western equatorial Atlantic. Preceded by a stepwise Cenomanian warming trend (~ 31 - 35 °C), the onset of the Cretaceous thermal maximum coincided here with the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event. Once established, this extreme warm climate regime, characterized by averaged tropical SSTs close to 35 °C, lasted up to the Turonian-Coniacian transition. Two pronounced cooler intervals (~ 2 - 3 °C) interrupt this otherwise remarkably stable record, providing the first d 18 <b>O</b> <b>independent</b> evidence for middle Turonian cooling that previously has been attributed to glacioeustatic sea-level lowering.

40|$|The {{most common}} {{objective}} function of task scheduling problems is makespan. However, on a computational grid, the 2 nd optimal makespan {{may be much}} longer than the optimal makespan because the computing power of a grid varies over time.
