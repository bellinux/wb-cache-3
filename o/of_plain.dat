50|$|There {{was a lack}} of {{attention}} and interest in the history <b>of</b> <b>plains</b> aborigines until the mid-1980s. Henceforth, through the works of scholars, folklorists, anthropologists, historians and remaining descendants <b>of</b> <b>plains</b> aborigines, there have been a gradual restoration <b>of</b> <b>plains</b> aboriginal culture, history, identity and language. For example, a descendant <b>of</b> <b>plains</b> aborigines in Hualien, Chieh Wan-lai, still insists on teaching the traditional language and culture <b>of</b> <b>plains</b> aborigines. More educational pamphlets are emerging to educate Taiwanese about the existence <b>of</b> <b>plains</b> aborigines. Furthermore, a campaign was started in Yilan for descendants of the Kavalan to find their roots. Many plains aboriginal festivals are emerging around Taiwan, and these have been opened up to the public and to people who have recently discovered their status as plains aborigines.|$|R

5|$|The {{fourth and}} the last edition <b>of</b> <b>Plain</b> Introduction was {{prepared}} and edited posthumously by Edward Miller (1825–1901). The book was edited by George Bell & Sons. It contains 15 plates with the texts of 40 manuscripts in facsimile (the 1st edition had 12 plates with 36 manuscripts). Some facsimiles were replaced. Instead of 2,094 manuscripts, as recorded in the third edition under six classes, no less than 3,791 were recorded in this edition, an increase of 236 beyond the 3,555 of Gregory, without counting the numerous vacant places which had been filled inp.|$|E
5|$|The {{main entry}} {{gate to the}} tomb is two-storied and its façade has very {{elaborate}} ornamentation over plastered surfaces and is in ornate purple colour. There is an inscription in Arabic {{on the surface and}} its translation reads “When the hero <b>of</b> <b>plain</b> bravery departs from the transitory, may he become a resident of god’s paradise”. The rear side of the façade, which is seen after entering through the gate, has many rooms and the library. To the right of the gate is the mosque which is a three-domed structure marked with stripes.|$|E
5|$|By 1683 the College {{part of the}} {{structure}} was finished. The new building was built out <b>of</b> <b>plain</b> bricks of three storeys, with basement and attic levels in addition. The College consists of an extensive range of quadrangular buildings. Apart from the hall, a porter's lodge and a public office, {{the rest of the}} building was given over to the heralds as accommodation. To the east and south sides three terraced houses were constructed for leases, their façade in keeping with the original design. In 1699 the hall, which for some time had been used as a library, was transformed into the Earl Marshal's Court or the Court of Chivalry; it remains so to this day. In 1776 some stylistic changes were made to the exterior of the building and some details, such as pediments and cornices were removed, transforming the building to the then popular but austere Neo-Classical style.|$|E

5|$|The town {{experiences}} long {{summers and}} short winters,and receives an average yearly rainfall of , {{mainly from the}} north-east monsoon between October and December. Its {{close proximity to the}} sea means that Sirkazhi receives more rainfall than neighbouring towns. Sirkazhi is part of the Cauvery delta region and has irrigation channels, called the Kollidam channels, which carry water from the rivers and provide a rich deposit of fertile silt before reaching the sea. The soil is black and contains fertile alluvial sediment. The area's main crop is rice; other crops grown in the area are coconut, tamarind and neem. The landscape mostly consists <b>of</b> <b>plain</b> lands with fields and small portions of scrub jungle. Antelope, spotted deer, wild hog, jackal and fox are present in the jungles and outlying areas of the town. Crow and ordinary game birds are found in large numbers in the town.|$|E
5|$|There {{are nine}} Twin-Pyramid Complexes at Tikal, {{one of which}} was {{completely}} dismantled in ancient times and some others were partly destroyed. They vary in size but consist of two pyramids facing each other on an east–west axis. These pyramids are flat-topped and have stairways on all four sides. A row <b>of</b> <b>plain</b> stelae is placed immediately {{to the west of the}} eastern pyramid and to the north of the pyramids, and lying roughly equidistant from them, there is usually a sculpted stela and altar pair. On the south side of these complexes there is a long vaulted building containing a single room with nine doorways. The entire complex was built at once and these complexes were built at 20-year (or k'atun) intervals during the Late Classic. The first twin pyramid complex was built in the early 6th century in the East Plaza. It was once thought that these complexes were unique to Tikal but rare examples have now been found at other sites, such as Yaxha and Ixlu, and they may reflect the extent of Tikal's political dominance in the Late Classic.|$|E
