40|$|The feeding {{behavior}} of the nudibranch Melibe leonina is unusual because it lacks a buccal mass. When sufficient prey {{are present in the}} water column, rhythmic feeding movements commence. A typical feeding cycle can be divided into 5 phases, beginning with the oral veil opened, and then followed by closing <b>of</b> the <b>oral</b> veil, squeezing and tilting of the head and veil, transfer of food into the mouth, and finally <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the <b>oral</b> veil. This pattern is then repeated at 0. 5 – 3 cycles/min, depending on the prey concentration. As the feeding rate increases, the duration of each feeding cycle decreases, but the proportion of a cycle occupied by a given phase of the behavior remains the same. When the density of prey are very low, animals will often initiate a feeding cycle and then terminate it just before the tilt and squeeze phase. These data, taken together, suggest that Melibe feeding is a fixed action pattern which is modulated by the availability of prey in the water column...|$|R

This lenient verdict (avoiding a sentence of death or imprisonment) became a cause celebre internationally and, along with the civilian deaths in North King Street, provoked a political furore which culminated in the appointment of several Royal Commissions of Inquiry. The Royal Commission on the deaths of Sheehy Skeffington, Dickson and McIntyre was chaired by Sir John Simon (a former Attorney General and Home Secretary), and held hearings on 23-31 August 1916 in a public courtroom at the Four Courts in Dublin. 38 witnesses were examined, including Sheehy Skeffington's wife Hanna.

40|$|FROM IUS COMMUNE TO IUS PROPRIUM: HISTORICAL VIEW <b>OF</b> <b>ORAL</b> TRADITION IN CHILE’S LEGAL PROCEEDINGS This {{research}} {{has made it}} possible to demonstrate the various usages of the spoken word that have allowed, already since the “Derecho Indiano” (Pre-Columbian Law), representing the most relevant principles that are to date enforced and have been proposed by modern Procedural Law, even before these principles were established. Naturally, as obvious as it may seem, there is a problem underlying the study <b>of</b> <b>oral</b> tradition from an historical point of view: normally, the only record left <b>of</b> <b>oral</b> procedural <b>proceedings</b> is a testimony that it was held. Although this makes it difficult to study these proceedings, as it will be shown it is not impossible. In fact, many of the currently known principles have been created by extrapolating the features that a fair trial should have. Therefore, usually several of such principles coincide in diverse procedural acts, whose aim is not more than having the parties heard by the judge and granting them with similar possibilities for their defence, both against potential abuses from the judge and against accusations of the opposite party. The court, in turn, has the right and obligation of leading the process in the most expeditious and cost-effective way possible, not affecting the rights of the parties to have a process in some cases and, especially, to defend themselves. Finally, in the benefit of the parties and society, {{there is a need for}} publicizing some of these procedural acts. All of the above is materialized in a series of principles that inform the proceeding and which are closely related to oral tradition, even when some of these procedural acts are registered in writing. The existence of civil or criminal processes not mainly based on a written form, the socialization of active legitimization and the measures oriented towards facilitating access to civil and criminal justice for all citizens, and in conditions of inequality, which is obvious and not denied but on the contrary deemed to be necessary, cannot lead to a total publicity of the criminal and civil process, which is what has been promoted in a slightly ideological manner by many States since the 20 th century. Besides, as it can be noticed in this research, many of the innovations introduced in the last decade had already been applied in other times of our legal history with better or worst results. 1 Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica - CONICY...|$|R

40|$|Mordacia mordax {{is one of}} the two {{anadromous}} parasitic lamprey {{species of}} the southern hemisphere family Mordaciidae. Its adults possess two lateral buccal glands and one central buccal gland. When the tongue-like piston is retracted, the buccal glands occupy much <b>of</b> the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the <b>oral</b> cavity {{at the rear of the}} buccal cavity. The glands contain numerous tube-like, ductless secretory units, which discharge directly into the buccal cavity. Their secretory epithelial cells contain numerous granules, some of which are zymogen-like, while others have a beaded, spiralled appearance. The similarity of the latter to mast cell granules suggests that they may likewise produce an anticoagulant, which would be valuable to a presumed blood feeder such as M. mordax. The mucus produced by these cells could act as a carrier for the secretions and as an adhesive for promoting retention of t he secretions on the host's surface. When the young adults is transferred to salt water, the buccal glands increase their production and discharge of secretions. Since the glands are not enclosed in musculature, their secretions are probably discharged by mechanical pressure applied by the forward movement of the head of the tooth-bearing piston into the buccal cavity. An account is given of the way in which the location, number, glandular organization, secretory granules, and type of secretion of the buccal glands of M. mordax, and thus presumably also their mode of function, differ markedly from those of members of the other lamprey family found in the southern hemisphere, and of all holarrctic lampreys...|$|R
