5|$|A {{planetary}}-mass object (PMO), planemo, or planetary body is {{a celestial}} object with a mass that falls within the range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> a planet: massive enough to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium (to be rounded under its own gravity), {{but not enough to}} sustain core fusion like a star. By definition, all planets are planetary-mass objects, but the purpose of this term is to refer to objects that do not conform to typical expectations for a planet. These include dwarf planets, which are rounded by their own gravity but not massive enough to clear their own orbit, the larger moons, and free-floating planemos, which may have been ejected from a system (rogue planets) or formed through cloud-collapse rather than accretion (sometimes called sub-brown dwarfs).|$|E
5|$|Metrologists {{carefully}} {{distinguish between}} {{the definition of a}} unit and its realisation. The definition of each base unit of the SI is drawn up so that it is unique and provides a sound theoretical basis on which the most accurate and reproducible measurements can be made. The realisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> a unit is the procedure by which the definition may be used to establish the value and associated uncertainty of a quantity of the same kind as the unit. A description of the mise en pratique of the base units is given in an electronic appendix to the SI Brochure.|$|E

5|$|One {{particular}} set of observations is related to eminently useful practical applications, namely to satellite navigation systems such as the Global Positioning System that are used both for precise positioning and timekeeping. Such systems rely on two sets of atomic clocks: clocks aboard satellites orbiting the Earth, and reference clocks stationed on the Earth's surface. General relativity predicts that these two sets of clocks should tick at slightly different rates, due to their different motions (an effect already predicted by special relativity) and their different positions within the Earth's gravitational field. In order to ensure the system's accuracy, the satellite clocks are either slowed down by a relativistic factor, or that same factor is made part of the evaluation algorithm. In turn, tests of the system's accuracy (especially the very thorough measurements that are part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> universal coordinated time) are testament to {{the validity of the}} relativistic predictions.|$|E

25|$|Newer {{proposals}} for quality models such as Squale and Quamoco propagate a direct integration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> quality attributes and measurement. By breaking down quality attributes or even defining additional layers, the complex, abstract quality attributes (such as reliability or maintainability) become more manageable and measurable. Those quality {{models have been}} applied in industrial contexts but have not received widespread adoption.|$|E

25|$|Rape {{by gender}} classifies types of rape by the sex or gender {{of both the}} rapist and the victim. This scope {{includes}} both rape and sexual assault more generally. Most research indicates that rape affects women disproportionately, {{with the majority of}} people convicted being men; however, since the broadening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> rape in 2012 by the FBI, more attention is being given to male rape, including females raping males.|$|E
