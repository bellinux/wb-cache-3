5|$|The company's first {{project was}} Disruptor, {{for the first}} PlayStation console, whose poor sales almost led to the company's bankruptcy. Insomniac's next project was Spyro the Dragon, a {{successful}} video game that spawned two sequels within two years. Insomniac then developed a new franchise, Ratchet & Clank, for the PlayStation 2. The company also developed the Resistance series for the PlayStation 3, and released its first multi-platform game, Fuse in 2013.

5|$|Ef: The Latter Tale begins {{once again}} with Yuko Amamiya and Yu Himura {{in the middle of}} a reunion in a church during Christmas time. Yuko tells Yu how she has {{influenced}} people in two separate stories (from Ef: The First Tale). After she is done with this, she asks him to tell her about the people he has influenced. Yu starts to tell his first story, that of Chihiro Shindo; the third chapter begins. Like Yuko, Yu also abruptly appears out <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>and</b> disappears just as mysteriously. He often gives advice and warnings to Renji and others. Yu is close to Chihiro and takes care of her. After the conclusion of the third chapter, the story goes back to Yuko and Yu with Yu ending his recount of the third chapter, and goes on to talk about how he and Yuko were separated in the past. Yu starts his recount of the events from the fourth chapter. At the end of the fourth chapter, the story shifts one final time back to Yuko and Yu. Up to this point the two have been recounting individual tales to each other. The meaning of the overall title Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two is revealed to be in connection with Yuko and Yu.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Christabel {{gives birth}} to a baby boy. Her father is so angry that he swears to have her killed, so he puts her into a small boat with her new-born baby and they are set adrift without food or water, {{at the mercy of}} the winds and the currents, to share a fate that is {{suffered}} also by Emaré and by Geoffrey Chaucer’s heroine Constance in his Canterbury tale from the Man of Law. Soon they are driven onto a rock, and mother and baby go ashore to sit with the seagulls. A griffin appears from out <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>and</b> carries the baby off.|$|E
25|$|As {{suddenly}} as they appeared, the tourists vanish. The fugitive {{returns to the}} museum to investigate and finds no evidence of people being there during his absence. He attributes the experience to a hallucination caused by food poisoning, but the tourists reappear that night. They have come out <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>and</b> yet they talk {{as if they have}} been there for a while. He watches them closely while still avoiding direct contact and notices more strange things. In the aquarium he encounters identical copies of the dead fish he found on his day of arrival. During a day at the pool, he sees the tourists jump to shake off the cold when the heat is unbearable. The strangest thing he notices is the presence of two suns and two moons in the sky.|$|E
25|$|After the tour's {{last show}} {{concluded}} in San Francisco, Shi secretly left his {{hotel in the}} middle of the night and escaped in order to defect from China to the United States. Speaking no English, Shi directed a cab driver with hand signals to an unknown destination, but the frustrated driver dropped him off in the middle <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>and</b> called the police. Shi showed the police his passport and some newspaper clippings featuring him, so the police requested the driver take him to a Chinese restaurant in order to find someone who could communicate with him. However, since the staff at the restaurant spoke only Cantonese, and not Shi's Mandarin, the monk wrote down his communications, since both dialects employ the same characters. The restaurant staff helped Shi phone a friend in New York City, who had someone pick up Shi, who hid in a basement for a week, eating only bread and cereal, while the news media were reporting his escape. After a week, he traveled to New York.|$|E

25|$|The Mongols {{also used}} {{deception}} {{very well in}} their wars. For instance, when approaching a mobile army the units would be split into three or more army groups, each trying to outflank and surprise their opponents. This created many battlefield scenarios for the opponents where the Mongols would seem to appear out <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>and</b> there were seemingly more of them than in actuality. Flanking and/or feigned retreat if the enemy could not be handled easily {{was one of the}} most practiced techniques. Other techniques used commonly by the Mongols were completely psychological and were used to entice/lure enemies into vulnerable positions by showing themselves from a hill or some other predetermined locations, then disappearing into the woods or behind hills while the Mongols' flank troops already strategically positioned would appear as if out of nowhere from the left, right and/or from their rear. During the initial states of battlefield contact, while camping in close proximity of their enemies at night, they would feign numerical superiority by ordering each soldier to light at least five fires, which would appear to the enemy scouts and spies that their force was almost five times larger than it actually was.|$|E
25|$|Since Korellian law forbids Foundation missionaries {{to be on}} {{the planet}} under penalty of death, the crew determines that the Reverend Jord Parma of Anacreon (as he calls himself) had been {{captured}} by the Korellians but managed to escape before being killed. Rev. Parma is injured, apparently mentally confused, and in need of hospitalization. A short time after Parma has been aboard the ship, an angry mob appears, surrounding the Far Star, and demanding that the missionary be turned over to them as an escaped criminal. This rapid response by the Korellians in what is an extremely remote location arouses Mallow's suspicions: Where did Parma actually escape from? Why was there a mob seemingly already gathered in the middle <b>of</b> <b>nowhere?</b> <b>And</b> how were they able to pinpoint the location of the Far Star and surround it so promptly after Parma boarded the ship? Suspecting a set-up, rather than fight the mob, Mallow decides to turn the missionary over to them (and to certain death), despite Twer's frantic attempt to intervene. Soon afterwards, Mallow is invited to meet with Korell's authoritarian ruler, Commdor ("First Citizen Of The State") Asper Argo, indicating that Mallow had apparently passed a test by the Korellians by showing respect for their laws. Argo appears friendly and welcomes Foundation technological gifts; however, he refuses to allow Scientism on Korell, and Mallow agrees not to encourage missionary work in the Republic.|$|E
500|$|The album {{liner notes}} give the album's full title as Hail to the Thief (Or, The Gloaming).

Radiohead struggled to name the album; they considered titling it The Gloaming (...) , but this was rejected for being too [...] "poetic" [...] and [...] "doomy" [...] and so became the album's subtitle. Other titles considered included Little Man Being Erased, The Boney King <b>of</b> <b>Nowhere</b> <b>and</b> Snakes and Ladders, which became the subtitles for the songs [...] "Go To Sleep", [...] "There There" [...] and [...] "Sit Down.

The album, The Story of Your Life, was released October 5, 2010, and according to West, {{is a response to}} thousands of life stories his fans shared with him. [...] "The first day, I got 1,000 stories. All of a sudden, I was like, 'holy cow, something special is about to take place'. I rented a cabin in Tennessee, about 25 minutes from my house that felt like it was out in the middle <b>of</b> <b>nowhere.</b> <b>And</b> I spent two months in that cabin reading 10,000 stories," [...] the singer/songwriter reported in an interview with CBN.com.

500|$|... "Radio Bart" [...] {{was written}} by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza, though series creator Matt Groening {{came up with the}} idea for it. The episode was based on the 1951 film Ace in the Hole, which sees the story of a down-and-out journalist exploiting a story about a man trapped in a cave to re-jump start his career. Vitti did not watch the film until after the episode had been written; [...] " [...] came in out <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>and</b> just gave me, start to finish, the whole story." [...] Vitti said renting the film was the first thing he did after finishing the script. He remarked, [...] "It's surprisingly hard to rent. It's really dark and funny and it's by Billy Wilder, so you think it would be in stores, but it's not. It was hard to find." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Labrecque wrote [...] "the episode really {{finished}} strong with {{a fabulous}} Gladys Knight musical number". Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide also praised the musical number, saying [...] "that 'Midnight Train to Georgia' number {{at the end}} of tonight's episode... Wow. So out <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>and</b> so fun." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad said that the episode [...] "was a good episode to go into the hiatus with, if that makes things better". He criticized the fact that the fictional TGS writing staff was not present in this episode, even though they could have been effectively used. Michael Neal of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a grading of A+. The Boston Globes Joanna Weiss reviewed the episode positively, saying [...] " [...] concluded with a musical interlude that was both hilarious and wistful".|$|E

500|$|Her {{next film}} was Square Dance (1987), where her teenage {{character}} creates {{a bridge between}} two different worlds – a traditional farm in the middle <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>and</b> a large city. Ryder won acclaim for her role, and the Los Angeles Times called her performance in Square Dance [...] "a remarkable debut." [...] Both films, however, were only marginally successful commercially. Director Tim Burton decided to cast Ryder in his film Beetlejuice (1988), after being impressed with her performance in Lucas. In the film, she plays goth teenager Lydia Deetz. Lydia's family moves to a haunted house populated by ghosts played by Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin and Michael Keaton. Lydia quickly finds herself the only human with a strong empathy toward the ghosts and their situation. The film was a success at the box office, and Ryder's performance and the overall film received mostly positive reviews from critics.|$|E
500|$|John Calvert of The Quietus called [...] "Pyramids" [...] {{a little}} [...] "structurally {{ramshackle}} though never erratic, it's {{the type of}} massive album centrepiece that was inconceivable before The-Dream's stadium-R reinvented the genre as a mythological epic." [...] Paley Martin of Most Blunted stated that the track [...] "is {{so much more than}} a song; it is an audible baptism, a narrative delicacy, a self-indulgent experience! And you best believe once you press play, this ride will take you to the destination of your choice." [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard felt that the real triumph was Ocean's song structure: [...] "verses and hooks collapse onto each other, rhymes pop up out <b>of</b> <b>nowhere,</b> <b>and</b> the singer acts like minutely balancing a 10-minute concept piece is no big deal." [...] Chris Richards of The Washington Post Company described the track as a [...] "righteous funk opus that spans nearly 10 minutes", commented that it [...] "is loaded with metaphorical riddles, drawing parallels between Cleopatra and a 21st-century prostitute. Puzzle over it. Dance to it. All of the above." ...|$|E

On March 8, the band released the music video for [...] "The Plot to Bomb the Panhandle", which featured Ron Jeremy. The video was filmed in Los Angeles. After being asked how they got Jeremy to appear, McKinnon said [...] "It was pretty much some that we were kicking around.

500|$|According to Casting Crowns' {{lead singer}} Mark Hall, {{the idea for}} [...] "Who Am I" [...] came while he was driving home {{with his wife and}} {{children}} one night.

500|$|The {{mistranslation}} spawned {{rumors about}} the existence of a Sheng Long character in the game, and players sent letters to video game publications attempting to confirm the character's existence. In the April 1992 issue of the video game magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly, a method was [...] "revealed" [...] to reach Sheng Long in the arcade game. The reporter gave an [...] "Honorable Mention" [...] to [...] "W.A. Stokins" [...] ("waste tokens") of [...] "Fuldigen, HA" [...] ("fooled again, ha") and claimed that the character could be found if a player using Ryu did not let the character suffer any damage during the entire game, and upon reaching the final match against M. Bison could neither hit Bison nor let him inflict any damage until the time limit expired, thus ending the round in a draw. After repeating this for ten consecutive rounds Sheng Long would then appear out <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>and</b> throw Bison off of the edge screen and out of the way. The game's on-screen timer would then stop at 99 seconds, resulting in a [...] "fight to the death" [...] between Ryu and Sheng Long.|$|E
