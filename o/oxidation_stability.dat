50|$|The {{comparison}} of the methyl esters of Pongamia oil to the ASTM D6751 standard for biodiesel fuels shows that processed Pongamia oil is within the standards.

30|$|The anion {{exchange}} membrane (AEM) shows some technological and scientific limitation. AEM suffers from a poor chemical stability in alkaline media arising from the hydroxide attack on the cationic group and resulting in the decreased anionic conductivity [46]. The AEM with OH− ion is less stable because AEM is easily converted to the less conductive CO_ 3 ^ 2 - and even less conductive HCO_ 3 ^- forms when exposed to air even for short time. Figure  10 d, e shows the comparison between {{before and after the}} treatment with alkali, indicating that AEM faced the problem of high swelling with the increased hydration [47]. This is a challenge in the handling of AEM. AEM is used to overcome the Nafion membrane degradation problem. However, AEM has a tendency to be hydrocarbon or aromatic based which gives rise to poor <b>oxidation</b> <b>stabilities</b> [41].|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to prepare a dimorphic magnetorheological (MR) fluid for which {{sedimentation}} <b>stability,</b> <b>oxidation</b> and chemical <b>stability</b> are enhanced in comparison with common MR fluids, {{while at the same}} time preserving the MR effect at its fullest practical level. A dimorphic MR fluid exhibiting these properties was prepared in two steps. The first step involved the partial substitution of carbonyl iron (CI) spherical microparticles with Fe rod-like particles synthesized via a surfactant-controlled solvothermal method. This improved sedimentation stability in comparison with the application of CI particles alone. In the second step both spherical CI and Fe rod-like particles were coated with a polysiloxane layer through the hydrolysis-condensation polymerization of tetraethylorthosilicate. This ensured better <b>oxidation</b> and chemical <b>stability</b> balance with an acceptable decrease in the MR effect. This effect is still markedly better than that based on Fe 3 O 4 particles. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R

30|$|Many {{studies have}} shown that croton {{biodiesel}} and blends can be effectively used as an alternative to petro-diesel. Aliyu et al. [23] reported that the performance of croton biodiesel was comparable to pure diesel fuel although the biodiesel produced less smoke and nitrogen oxides. Osawa et al. [24] reported that croton biodiesel blends of up to 50  % with petro-diesel can be effectively used as an alternative fuel without compromising the engine performance. Since the <b>oxidation</b> and storage <b>stability</b> determine the duration that a particular fuel can be stored or used without causing any hazardous effects in internal combustion engines, it is important that comprehensive studies are performed under different conditions in order to identify the most suitable storage conditions. Improvement of <b>oxidation</b> and storage <b>stability</b> can enable the biodiesel to be kept over a longer duration of time without fear of formation of oxidation products which can either damage engine or lower its fuel qualities. In this study, the effects of five commercial antioxidants on <b>oxidation</b> and storage <b>stability</b> of croton biodiesel and its blends with petro-diesel were investigated over a period of 8  weeks under ordinary storage conditions.|$|R

50|$|Many {{textbooks}} describe carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in {{easily understood}} terms: carbon nanotubes are tubular structures made entirely of rolled-up layers of graphene. The diameters of CNTs ranges from about one nanometer {{to tens of}} nanometers, while their lengths can be up to centimeters, {{much greater than the}} diameters. In general, the hollow geometry of CNTs leads to large specific surface areas, which makes CNTs extremely attractive supports for heterogeneous catalysts. Another advantage of CNTs is their relatively high <b>oxidation</b> <b>stability</b> which is induced by their structural integrity and chemical inertness. Additionally, CNTs have exceptional physical properties including electrical conductivity, mechanical strength and thermal conductivity, which are important factors for catalyst supports. CNTs can be either metallic or semiconductive, depending on their helicity and diameter, and this property can greatly affect charge transfer processes. CNTs possess a very large Young's modulus, as well as a great tensile strength, and their flexibility property makes them an ideal component for applications in composite materials. CNTs also have good thermal conductivitity, which helps to prevent the agglomeration and growth of small nanoparticles during postannealing treatments, and stabilize newly formed phases.|$|E
