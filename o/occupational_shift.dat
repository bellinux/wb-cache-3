Using data from a nationally representative longitudinal survey of rural households in Bangladesh conducted in three waves in 1988, 2000, and 2004, this article relates the dynamics of rural poverty reduction to the structural shift in income generation mechanism from farm to nonfarm activities, changing household factor endowments, and the adoption of improved agricultural technologies over time. -super- 1 The findings show that the <b>occupational</b> <b>shift</b> from the farm to the nonfarm sector, such as trade, business, and services, {{as well as the}} expansion of cultivated areas through tenancy, enhance income growth. Geographic mobility, overseas migration in particular, makes a significant contribution to income growth as well. The reduction in poverty appears to be vitally dependent on the enhancement of the endowment of human and physical capital that augments the poor households' capability to better exploit income-generating opportunities and place the households on a sustainable route out of poverty.

This paper aims {{to identify the}} underlying sources of this residual growth, being explicit about micro underpinnings and transitional growth from occupation choices of heterogeneous agents and financial deepening in use of both macro and micro data. We develop a method of growth accounting that decomposes not only the overall growth but also the residual TFP growth into four components: <b>occupational</b> <b>shifts,</b> financial deepening, capital heterogeneity, and sectoral Solow residuals. Applying this method to Thailand, which experienced rapid growth with enormous structural changes for the two decades between 1976 and 1996, we find that 55 percent of TFP growth can be explained on average by <b>occupational</b> <b>shifts</b> and financial deepening, without presuming exogenous technical progress.

Methodologically, we propose a new road quality instrument using a nationwide panel dataset of road surface roughness to predict road quality from temporal variation in budgets exogenously allocated to different road maintenance authorities. We first show that higher road network quality leads to job creation in the manufacturing sector. We then show that this is reflected in household consumption and income.

40|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} over the last several decades that juggling the responsibilities of paid work and home is difficult (Anderson, 2003). With the dramatic {{increase in the number of}} women who have entered the paid work force in the U. S. over the past 30 years (from just over 40 percent in 1970 to 60 percent in 2000) (U. S. Department of Labor, 2001) sociologists have sought to understand how this <b>occupational</b> <b>shift</b> affects families. Some research has shown that for families to balance the two spheres of paid work and home, women end up taking on a "second shift " or a "double day " of housework and childcare (Hochschild, 1989). In terms ofwhich sphere is prioritized, working class women are more likely to put family first while professional women see work as more central in their lives (Burris, 1991). Regardless, one of the most common strategies in coping with the competing demands of paid work and family is for women to reduce their work hours or to limit their careers, especially after the birth of a child (Becker and Moen, 1999). Despite a growing literature on the intersection of paid work and family and the ways that women balance the two (Hochschild, 1989), little research has been cbnducted on the experiences of mothers working in professional careers that offer a certain degree of flexibility and autonomy: faculty tenure track positions at a college or university. These positions, requiring years of schooling and preparation, offer-at least in theory-a large amount of flexibility in terms of where and when the work is performed. Unlike many other jobs, such as clerical work, law, or information technology, university faculty usually do not have to be in their offices standard working hours: Monday to Friday, 9 am to 5 pm.

40|$|The Second World War {{divides the}} history of American {{psychology}} into two major epochs. Before the war psychology was largely an academic discipline, imbued with an ideology of experimental natural science. Following the war, psychology became identified increasingly as a consulting profession offering practical services {{to a variety of}} clients, including commercial enterprises, government agencies, and private citizens. World War II acted as a catalyst for the professionalization of applied psychology, fundamentally altering the relation between science and practice in the discipline. ^ This dissertation explores the process of institutional change in psychology by analyzing the responses of psychologists to the wartime environment. By providing powerful incentives to engage in applied work, the war sanctioned the expansion of professional services roles outside of the university. Psychologists readily undertook the task of making their science relevant to national needs, and created a central coordinating group [...] the Emergency Committee in Psychology of the National Research Council [...] to oversee mobilization efforts. The war caused a radical <b>occupational</b> <b>shift</b> among psychologists. Around half of the 4, 000 -person profession was directly employed by the federal government [...] in the military services, in civilian agencies, or on research contracts. An additional portion voluntarily directed their teaching, research, and service activities toward wartime concerns. Pure experimentalists and applied practitioners alike {{got caught up in the}} excitment of war work. Harking back to their field 2 ̆ 7 s accomplishments in the First World War, psychologists adopted a technocratic view of their potential contributions, and easily grafted the ideal of national service onto their existing scientific ideology. ^ Promoting themselves as experts concerning the 2 ̆ 2 human factor 2 ̆ 2 in warfare, psychologists found employment in military personnel work, propaganda analysis, survey research, equipment design, and other areas. Although these wideranging activities often had little in common aside from a basic concern with human behavior, they helped foster a sense of mission within the psychology community. Led by Robert M. Yerkes, professionalizers took advantage of favorable wartime conditions and successfully transformed the American Psychological Association from a scientific learned society into a comprehensive professional organization. Dedicated to both science and practice, the new APA united previously fragmented interest groups and became a potent vehicle for the expansion of psychology 2 ̆ 7 s domain as a consulting profession. ...|$|E

These influences, in turn, may affect an individual&# 39;s behavior and risk of developing NCDs. The Chiang Mai University (CMU) Health Worker Study aims to provide evidence for a better understanding of the development of NCDs and ultimately to apply the evidence toward better prevention, risk modification, and improvement of clinical care for patients with NCDs and NCD-related conditions. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of health care workers from CMU Hospital was conducted between January 2013 and June 2013. Questionnaires, interviews, and physical and laboratory examinations were used to assess urban exposure, <b>occupational</b> <b>shift</b> work, risk factors for NCDs, self-reported NCDs, and other NCD-related health conditions. Results: From 5, 364 eligible workers, 3, 204 participated (59. 7 %). About 11. 1 % of the participants had high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg) and almost 30 % were considered to be obese (body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m 2). A total of 2. 3 % had a high fasting blood glucose level (≥ 126 mg/dL), and the most common abnormal lipid profile was high low-density lipoprotein (≥ 160 mg/dL), which was found in 19. 2 % of participants. Discussion: The study of health workers offers three potential advantages. The first is that the study of migrants was possible. Socioenvironmental influence on NCD risk factors can be explored, as changes in environmental exposures can be documented. Second, it allows the investigators to control for access to care. Access to care is potentially a key confounder toward understanding the development of NCDs. Lastly, a study of health personnel allows easy access to laboratory investigations and potential for long-term follow-up. This enables ascertainment of a number of clinical outcomes and provides potential for future studies focusing on therapeutic and prognostic issues related to NCDs.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} combines three projects, each analyzing how {{markets or}} individuals respond to different policy or environmental changes in low and middle income countries. Each study theoretically motivates the hypotheses {{of interest and}} combines novel data {{from a wide range}} of sources to test them. The first chapter examines the role of prices of foods, rich in different nutrients in the obesity and diet-related disease epidemic in Mexico. In response to the growing epidemic of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases, a number of governments are proposing taxes designed to reduce the consumption of unhealthy foods and thereby improve health outcomes. In this paper, I provide the first estimates of the effects of price changes of foods rich in sugar on the prevalence of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension. The analysis is made possible by rich longitudinal and nationally representative micro data on food prices and objective measures of health outcomes in Mexico for the period 1996 - 2010. I employ a unique bar-coded level price dataset with product-specific nutritional information combined with two datasets on health outcomes: (1) a state-level administrative dataset and (2) an individual panel dataset. Exploiting plausibly exogenous within-state variation in prices over time, I show that a decrease in the price of sugar-rich foods significantly increases the prevalence of abdominal obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. In addition, the least healthy and most impatient individuals seem to be more responsive to price changes, suggesting that time preferences are an important mechanism driving the results. Overall, the effect of sugar prices on the incidence of chronic diseases is large. Since the signing of NAFTA, I estimate that the reduction in prices of sugar-rich foods explains 20 percent of the increase in diabetes. The second chapter, joint work with Paul J. Gertler, identifies how junk food and soda taxes are passed through to consumer prices. I use a unique bar-code level price dataset with product-specific nutritional information and the introduction of junk food and soda taxes in Mexico in January 2014 to assess whether and how the excess tax burden is split between consumers and producers. Preliminary results suggests that pass-through is the strongest for sodas, followed by snacks, candy and cakes. For these products a full pass-through materializes within six months after the introduction of the tax. On average, the tax is not fully passed through to consumer prices in the case of cereal and cookies. However, the pass through is increasing over time for the latter, reaching a full pass-through by May 2014. We also observe large variation in pass-through across cities - from over to under shifting; hence observing decreases in consumer prices as well. Using price elasticities of health from Gracner (2015), a one time introduction of junk food and soda taxes in Mexico would imply approximately one and a half percentage point decrease in abdominal obesity and between a quarter to one half of a percentage point decrease in type II diabetes prevalence, under the assumption of a symmetric response to a price change. The third chapter, based on joint work with Paul J. Gertler, Marco Gonzalez-Navarro, and Alex D. Rothenberg, provides evidence of the effects of road quality on local economic activity using temporal variation generated by maintenance investments in roads. A long panel of firms and households allows us to shed light on the effects of road quality for pre-existing households and firms. Methodologically, we propose a new road quality instrument using a nationwide panel dataset of road surface roughness to predict road quality from temporal variation in budgets exogenously allocated to different road maintenance authorities. We first show that higher road network quality improves household consumption and income. We then show that this is partly due to job creation in the manufacturing sector. Third, we show evidence of an <b>occupational</b> <b>shift</b> from agriculture into manufacturing and higher profits for those who stay in agriculture.

However, emerging adulthood even occurs in industrialized nations that do not value individualization, as is the case in some Asian countries discussed below.|$|R

Similar to labor force re-entrants, those dislocated workers who become re-employed would experience wages below their final wage prior to dislocation and the decrease should be associated with the length of dislocation.

40|$|In many areas, {{the number}} of people {{transitioning}} to retirement is starting to outnumber {{the number of}} young people negotiating their way into the labor market. To sustain economic prosperity, these regions need to prolong the working lives of older workers. Maintaining older workers’ earning power and employment until and past the traditional retirement age will depend simultaneously on strengthening the quality of jobs, and on supporting older workers’ willingness and ability to engage in new career learning so they can keep up with <b>occupational</b> <b>shifts</b> and skill changes. One key challenge policymakers and institutions face in their attempts to address aging-related labor market challenges is the lack of historic examples available to guide decision making. Using a generational transition lens, my dissertation examines the intersections of two global trends – unprecedented population aging and volatile labor markets – at a local level. It focuses on building the case for employability of older workers as a way to inform cross-sectoral policy planning and investments for the benefit of all generations. More specifically, the purpose of my study is to inform policymakers and institutions concerned with the provision of education and skills training for workers later in life as a means of promoting both successful generational transitions and sustainable tax bases...|$|R
40|$|Shift {{work is the}} {{arrangement}} of working hours by a workplace {{to do something that}} is usually divided into work in the morning, evening and night. Occupational stress is emotional and physical response that is distracting or detrimental to that occur when the demands of the task do not match with the capabilities, resource or desire of workers. This study aim to know the difference between the levels of <b>occupational</b> stress <b>shift</b> in the morning, evening and night on Inpatient nurses in RSUD Banyudono Boyolali. This study uses analiytic observational method with crosssectional approach. The population in this study are all nurses of inpatient room in the hospital Banyudono Boyolali which is totally 38 nurses. Sampling technique uses total sampling. Using the Kruskal-Wallis analysis indicates that there are significant differences between level of <b>occupational</b> stress <b>shift</b> in the morning, evening and night on Inpatient nurses in RSUD Banyudono Boyolali with p value = 0, 036 on highest stress levels at night shift, meanwhile the value of the mean rank is 66, 91. It is recommended the improvement of the management of working hours such as adding working hours on the afternoon shift only 6 hours in order to the nurses on night shift was not just for 11, 5 hours...|$|R
40|$|This paper computes some {{potential}} employment and income effects of microelectronic-based technical change (MTC) in Canada. The probable {{upper and lower}} bounds of the predicted outcomes are determined by simulating alternative scenarios, and by computing the range of feasible post technical change transition paths for each scenario. The <b>occupational</b> <b>shifts</b> required to accommodate the technical change are decomposed into those originating from the supply side (labor productivity and material input changes) versus those induced by final demand changes. These results are presented for an historical period, for the reference or counterfactual (no MTC) path to 1990, and for a 1990 post-technical-change solution. The aggregate results for a plausible scenario indicate that the microelectronic-based technical change modelled in this paper initiates a one-half percent average yearly increase in labor productivity and consequently results in a cumulative displacement of 5 to 6 percent of the (1990) required labor force from 1981 to 1990. Of course, when/if the appropriate structural adjustments take place, those workers will be re-employed and national income will improve correspondingly. An increase in Canada's rate of diffusion (especially vish-vis our trading partners) implies more initial displacement, but again the even higher productivity gains (plus the potential for export gains) should ultimately improve national welfare. This conclusion highlights the importance of facilitating the required structural adjustments. 1...|$|R

We document spatial patterns and feature the integration of space into the micro estimation and simulation of two structural models of development. Speci 8 ̆ 5 cally, we study the temporal and spatial dynam-ics of entrepreneurship in Thailand in a high growth period, 1986 to 1996. Using biannual village census data as well as the geo-locations of more than 1000 of those villages, we are able to study in each of four provinces the spatial patterns of the data as well as the interplay of that data with the predictions of an occupation choice model representative of the development literature, but modi 8 ̆ 5 ed to incorporate space.
