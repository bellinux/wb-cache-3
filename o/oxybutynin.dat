Treatments for bladder {{problems}} {{vary depending on the}} origin or type of dysfunction but can mainly divided into treatment of bladder control and incontinence, and of urinary tract infections. Regarding bladder control, some examples of medications used are desmopressin for nocturia and anticholinergic drugs such as <b>oxybutynin</b> and tolterodine for urinary urgency. Non-pharmacological management includes pelvic floor muscle training, stimulation, pessaries, bladder retraining, changes to daily life habits such as clothing, use of external urine collection devices for men and incontinence pads for women; [...] and sometimes intermittent urinary catheterization. Regarding long term catheterization, it is associated to urinary tract infections and should be avoided whenever possible. Some of these recommendations do not come from specific studies in MS but are general recommendations for those who have neurogenic bladder.|$|E
50|$|In two {{trials of}} {{patients}} with overactive bladder, transdermal <b>oxybutynin</b> 3.9 mg/day decreased the number of incontinence episodes and increased average voided volume to a significantly greater extent than placebo.

5000|$|N-Desethyloxybutynin is {{an active}} {{metabolite}} of <b>oxybutynin</b> that is thought responsible {{for much of the}} adverse effects {{associated with the use of}} <b>oxybutynin.</b> N-Desethyloxybutynin plasma levels may reach as much as six times that of the parent drug after administration of the immediate-release oral formulation. Alternative dosage forms have been developed in an effort to reduce blood levels of N-desethyloxybutynin and achieve a steadier concentration of <b>oxybutynin</b> than is possible with the immediate release form. The long-acting formulations also allow once-daily administration instead of the twice-daily dosage required with the immediate-release form. The transdermal patch, in addition to the benefits of the extended-release oral formulations, bypasses the first-pass hepatic effect that the oral formulations are subject to. [...] In those with overflow incontinence because of diabetes or neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis or spinal cord trauma, <b>oxybutynin</b> can worsen overflow incontinence since the fundamental problem is that the bladder is not contracting.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{anticholinergic}} {{drugs can}} reduce hyperhidrosis. <b>Oxybutynin</b> (brand name Ditropan) {{is one that}} has shown promise, [...] although it can have side-effects, such as drowsiness, visual symptoms and dryness of the mouth and other mucous membranes.

50|$|<b>Oxybutynin</b> {{contains}} one stereocenter. Commercial formulations {{are sold}} as the racemate. The (R)-enantiomer {{is a more}} potent anticholinergic than either the racemate or the (S)-enantiomer, which is essentially without anticholinergic activity at doses used in clinical practice. However, (R)-oxybutynin administered alone offers little or no clinical benefit {{above and beyond the}} racemic mixture. The other actions (calcium antagonism, local anesthesia) of <b>oxybutynin</b> are not stereospecific. (S)-Oxybutynin has not been clinically tested for its spasmolytic effects, but may be clinically useful for the same indications as the racemate, without the unpleasant anticholinergic side effects.|$|E
50|$|Common {{adverse effects}} that are {{associated}} with <b>oxybutynin</b> and other anticholinergics include: dry mouth, difficulty in urination, constipation, blurred vision, drowsiness, and dizziness. Anticholinergics have also been known to induce delirium.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxybutynin</b> {{chloride}} is contraindicated {{in patients}} with untreated narrow angle glaucoma, and {{in patients with}} untreated narrow anterior chamber angles—since anticholinergic drugs may aggravate these conditions. It is also contraindicated in partial or complete obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, hiatal hernia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, paralytic ileus, intestinal atony of the elderly or debilitated patient, megacolon, toxic megacolon complicating ulcerative colitis, severe colitis, and myasthenia gravis. It is contraindicated in patients with obstructive uropathy and in patients with unstable cardiovascular status in acute hemorrhage. <b>Oxybutynin</b> chloride is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the product.|$|E
50|$|If a {{young person}} {{experiences}} incontinence resulting from an overactive bladder, a doctor might prescribe a medicine that helps to calm the bladder muscle, such as <b>oxybutynin.</b> This medicine controls muscle spasms and belongs to a class of medications called anticholinergics.|$|E
50|$|Other {{drugs that}} are often used to treat {{nocturia}} include <b>oxybutynin,</b> tolterodine, solifenacin, and other antimuscarinic agents. These drugs are especially used in {{patients who suffer from}} nocturia due to an overactive bladder and urgency incontinence because they help bladder contractility.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} antimuscarinic drugs (e.g., darifenacin, hyoscyamine, <b>oxybutynin,</b> tolterodine, solifenacin, trospium, fesoterodine) are {{frequently}} {{used to treat}} overactive bladder. β3 adrenergic receptor agonists (e.g., mirabegron), may be used, as well. They are, however, a second line treatment due {{to the risk of}} side effects.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} exist to treat incontinence including: fesoterodine, tolterodine and <b>oxybutynin.</b> While a number {{appear to have}} a small benefit, the risk of side effects are a concern. For every ten or so people treated only one will become able to control their urine and all medication are of similar benefit.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxybutynin</b> (brand names Ditropan, Lyrinel XL, Lenditro (ZA), Driptane (RU), Uripan (Middle East)) is an {{anticholinergic}} medication used {{to relieve}} urinary and bladder difficulties, including frequent urination and inability to control urination (urge incontinence), by decreasing muscle spasms of the bladder. It is also given {{to help with}} symptoms associated with kidney stones.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxybutynin</b> {{chloride}} exerts direct antispasmodic {{effect on}} smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. It exhibits {{one-fifth of the}} anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects).|$|E
50|$|Anticholinergic drugs used {{to treat}} overactive bladder were all amines as of 2003. Quaternary {{ammonium}} cations in general are more hydrophilic than other amines and don't cross membranes well, so {{they tend to be}} poorly absorbed from the digestive system, and to not cross the blood-brain barrier. <b>Oxybutynin,</b> tolterodine, darifenacin, and solifenacin are tertiary amines while trospium chloride and propantheline are quaternary amines.|$|E
50|$|Tolterodine, {{although}} it acts on {{all types of}} receptors, has fewer side effects than <b>oxybutynin</b> (M3 and M1 selective, but more so in the parotid than in the bladder) as tolterodine targets the bladder more than {{other areas of the}} body. This means that less drug needs to be given daily (due to efficient targeting of the bladder) and so there are fewer side effects.|$|E
50|$|These are dose-related and {{sometimes}} severe. In one population studied—after six months, {{more than half}} of the patients had stopped taking the medication because of side effects and calcium defects. An intake of calcium of 800 to 1000 mg is suggested. Dry mouth may be particularly severe; one estimate is that over a quarter of patients who begin <b>oxybutynin</b> treatment may have to stop because of dry mouth.|$|E
50|$|Prescription {{medications}} called anticholinergics, {{taken by}} mouth, are sometimes {{used in the}} treatment of both generalized and focal hyperhidrosis. Anticholinergics used for hyperhidrosis include propantheline, glycopyrronium bromide or glycopyrrolate, <b>oxybutynin,</b> methantheline, and benzatropine. Use of these drugs can be limited, however, by side-effects, including dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, and visual disturbances such as mydriasis (dilation of the pupils) and cycloplegia. For people who find their hyperhidrosis is made worse by anxiety-provoking situations (public speaking, stage performances, special events such as weddings, etc.), taking an anticholinergic medicine before the event may be helpful.|$|E
50|$|A 50% {{solution}} of DMSO {{had the potential}} to create irreversible muscle contraction. However, a lesser {{solution of}} 25% was found to be reversible. Long-term use of DMSO is questionable, as its mechanism of action is not fully understood though DMSO is thought to inhibit mast cells and may have anti-inflammatory, muscle-relaxing, and analgesic effects. Other agents used for bladder instillations to treat interstitial cystitis include: heparin, lidocaine, chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid, pentosan polysulfate, <b>oxybutynin,</b> and botulinum toxin A. Preliminary evidence suggests these agents are efficacious in reducing symptoms of interstitial cystitis, but further study with larger, randomized, controlled clinical trials is needed.|$|E

50|$|A 2009 {{literature}} review on women found that no drug seemed better than others, and paid {{special attention to}} comparing newer drugs to older ones.

40|$|<b>Oxybutynin</b> is a muscarinic {{receptor}} antagonist, {{which has}} been available {{for a number of}} years in its original immediate-release (IR) formulation. While <b>oxybutynin</b> IR has proven effective for the treatment of overactive bladder, its extended use can be limited by adverse effects, particularly dry mouth. An extended-release (ER) formulation of <b>oxybutynin</b> based on the OROS system has recently become available, which allows once daily administration.

40|$|PURPOSE: A {{proportion}} {{of patients with}} detrusor hyperreflexia who are unresponsive to oral <b>oxybutynin</b> often benefit from intravesical <b>oxybutynin</b> instillation. To our knowledge the precise mode of action of this method is obscure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 12 patients with detrusor hyperreflexia who were previously unresponsive to oral and intravesical passive diffusion of 5 mg. <b>oxybutynin</b> we administered 5 mg. <b>oxybutynin</b> orally as well as increased doses of 15 mg. <b>oxybutynin</b> intravesically with passive diffusion and with 15 mA. associated electric current. Each administration mode per patient was associated with an 8 -hour urodynamic monitoring session during which <b>oxybutynin</b> and N-desethyl <b>oxybutynin</b> plasma levels, and intravesical <b>oxybutynin</b> uptake were measured. RESULTS: A dose of 5 mg. <b>oxybutynin</b> orally induced no urodynamic improvement with an area under the plasma concentration time curve of combined N-desethyl <b>oxybutynin</b> plus <b>oxybutynin</b> of 16, 297 ng. / 8 hours and an area under the curve ratio of N-desethyl oxybutynin-to-oxybutynin of 11 : 1. Passive diffusion <b>oxybutynin</b> resulted in 12 mg. <b>oxybutynin</b> intravesical uptake and significant improvement in 3 of 8 urodynamic measurements, although the area under the curve of combined N-desethyl <b>oxybutynin</b> plus <b>oxybutynin</b> was only 2, 123 ng. / 8 hours and the N-desethyl oxybutynin-to-oxybutynin ratio was 1. 1 : 1. 0. Electromotive administration of <b>oxybutynin</b> resulted in almost complete intravesical uptake of the 15 mg. dose, significant improvement in all 8 urodynamic measurements and an increased <b>oxybutynin</b> level versus oral and passive diffusion, although the area under the curve of combined N-desethyl <b>oxybutynin</b> plus <b>oxybutynin</b> was 4, 574 ng. / 8 hours and the N-desethyl oxybutynin-to-oxybutynin ratio was inverted at 1. 0 : 1. 4. The oral dose of 5 mg. <b>oxybutynin</b> caused anticholinergic side effects in 8 of the 12 patients. Neither intravesical passive diffusion nor electromotive administration caused side effects with an uptake of 12 and 15 mg., respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A large {{proportion of}} intravesical <b>oxybutynin</b> is sequestered, probably in the urothelium.

40|$|Purpose Children with an overactive {{neurogenic bladder}} need clean {{intermittent}} catheterisation and anticholinergics {{to protect their}} upper urinary tract. Oral <b>oxybutynin</b> is the pharmacological treatment of choice, but it is known to induce several systemic anticholinergic side effects. Intravesical instillation of <b>oxybutynin</b> has been proven {{to be an effective}} alternative by escaping the first pass metabolism and therefore causing less systemic side effects in adults. Evidence about the dosage of intravesical <b>oxybutynin</b> in children is still unavailable. Furthermore, the stability of <b>oxybutynin</b> stored at different conditions has to be investigated. Material and methods The dosage of intravesical <b>oxybutynin</b> was retrospectively evaluated in 29 children (aged 0 – 16 years) with detrusor overactivity using urodynamic examinations. The activity of <b>oxybutynin,</b> stored at - 18 ˚C, 4 ˚C and 20 ˚C, was investigated in vitro in bladder strips of the detrusor muscle of 33 male Wistar rats (weight 250 – 345 gram). After increasing concentrations of <b>oxybutynin</b> (1 * 10 - 7 – 1 * 10 - 4 M) were applied to the bladder strips, the contractile force was measured. Results	 The present study showed that the dosage of intravesical <b>oxybutynin</b> was mainly dependent on bodyweight and bladder compliance. The effect of intravesical <b>oxybutynin</b> could be predicted for boys and girls using the following factors: weight, bladder capacity, intravesical pressure and follow-up. A relationship between the oral dosage and the initial intravesical dosage seems to be present. The dose-response relation of <b>oxybutynin</b> in bladder strips of rats was significant (p< 0. 0001). No influence of storage conditions was seen in contractile response when using <b>oxybutynin</b> within 6 weeks. <b>Oxybutynin</b> stored in the refrigerator for 12 weeks showed an unexpectedly strong inhibiting effect compared to 2 or 6 weeks (p= 0. 01). Conclusions Primarily, intravesical <b>oxybutynin</b> in children is mainly a function of bodyweight and bladder compliance. This study provides a guide to start treatment and a formula to calculate further dosages. Secondarily, the storage instructions of the syringes containing <b>oxybutynin</b> can probably be less strict compared to the current opinion. These conclusions contribute to an improvement in convenience of the treatment. Overall, this study enhances the knowledge of the application of intravesical <b>oxybutynin</b> in children. ...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To unravel why {{intravesical}} <b>oxybutynin</b> is {{more effective}} and causes significantly fewer systemic side effects than oral <b>oxybutynin</b> {{in the treatment of}} neurogenic bladder dysfunction, we tested the hypothesis that the absorption and metabolism of <b>oxybutynin</b> are changed after intravesical instillation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A high-performance liquid chromatography assay was developed for both <b>oxybutynin</b> and its active metabolite, N-desethyl-oxybutynin. Plasma concentrations were quantified after intravesical (n = 11) and oral (n = 5) administration of <b>oxybutynin</b> in children under steady-state conditions. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. RESULTS: Oral administration of <b>oxybutynin</b> (0. 2 mg. /kg. /dose) resulted in peak plasma concentrations for N-desethyl-oxybutynin which were 7. 4 +/- 1. 3 times higher than corresponding values for <b>oxybutynin</b> (n = 5). Also the AUC (area under the plasma concentration time curve) values were higher for N-desethyl-oxybutynin compared with those of <b>oxybutynin,</b> the ratio being 10. 8 +/- 1. 0 (n = 5). Intravesical instillation (0. 2 mg. /kg. /dose), on the other hand, resulted in reduced metabolite generation and peak plasma concentrations for N-desethyl-oxybutynin which were in the same range as those for <b>oxybutynin,</b> the ratio being 1. 2 +/- 0. 1 (n = 11). The ratio for the AUC values for N-desethyl-oxybutynin and <b>oxybutynin</b> was 2. 1 +/- 0. 2 (n = 11). CONCLUSIONS: The significantly lower AUC ratio of the N-desethyl metabolite over the mother compound, due to a reduced first pass metabolism, may explain the clinically relevant reduction of side effects that characterizes intravesical compared with oral <b>oxybutynin</b> therapy. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Summary. A {{method to}} obtain and {{guarantee}} a multidose sterile <b>oxybutynin</b> solution useful in treating pediatric neurogenic bladder. Objective. <b>Oxybutynin</b> hydrochloride {{represents one of}} the anticholinergic drugs used in pediatric neurogenic bladder, and it is available either orally in generic formulation as tablets and syrup, or as a transdermal patch and as a topical gel. Despite the efficacy of <b>oxybutynin,</b> these systemic delivery systems present significant side effects, and therefore {{a number of studies have}} explored an intravesical <b>oxybutynin</b> solution as an alternative. Since a commercial intravesical <b>oxybutynin</b> solution for use in pediatric neurogenic bladder is currently not available, it could be useful to find a method to guarantee the sterility of prepared <b>oxybutynin</b> solution in order to prevent bacterial growth in the urinary tract after catheterization. Methods. A simple method to prepare a stable and sterile multidose solution of <b>oxybutynin</b> for pediatric neurogenic bladder was developed. The stability of the solution was evaluated using two techniques: ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometry and spectrometric Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) ”. In order to maximize the sensitivity of both the proposed methods solvent system, wavelength of detection, and mass spectrometry conditions were optimized. Results. No spectrum changes have been observed with UV/Vis method and no quantitative modification has been noticed in the NMR method. The solution after six months conforms perfectly with that calculated on the same solution when initially prepared. Conclusions. It was concluded that both methods that were developed are equally accurate, sensitive, precise, reproducible, and efficient, and both could be applied directly and easily to evaluate the pharmaceutical preparation of <b>oxybutynin.</b> The stability and sterility of the <b>oxybutynin</b> solution were determined to last six months...|$|E
