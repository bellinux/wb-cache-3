The improvements lasted mere months, however, {{and by the end of}} 1994, both Green and Farrar had fallen back to their <b>old</b> <b>habits</b> and the marriage was again floundering. Fearful of another confrontation with Green, and looking forward to a trip to Peru the family had planned for June 1995, Farrar nevertheless decided to wait until after the trip to raise the issue of a divorce again.|$|E
5|$|From Chicago, Bundy {{traveled}} by train to Ann Arbor, Michigan. There, on January 2 {{in a local}} tavern, he watched his alma mater UW defeat Michigan in the Rose Bowl. Five days later he stole a car and drove to Atlanta, where he boarded a bus and arrived in Tallahassee, Florida, {{on the morning of}} January 8. He rented a room under the alias Chris Hagen at a boarding house near the Florida State University (FSU) campus. Bundy later said that he initially resolved to find legitimate employment and refrain from further criminal activity, knowing he could probably remain free and undetected in Florida indefinitely as long as he did not attract the attention of police; but his lone job application, at a construction site, had to be abandoned when he was asked to produce identification. He reverted to his <b>old</b> <b>habits</b> of shoplifting and stealing credit cards from women's wallets left in shopping carts.|$|E
25|$|The {{emancipation}} of the serfs came in 1770–1830, {{beginning with}} Schleswig in 1780. The peasants were now ex-serfs and could own their land, {{buy and sell}} it, and move about freely. The nobles approved for now they could buy land owned by the peasants. The chief reformer was Baron vom Stein (1757–1831), who was influenced by The Enlightenment, especially the free market ideas of Adam Smith. The end of serfdom raised the personal legal status of the peasantry. A bank was set up so that landowners could borrow government money to buy land from peasants (the peasants {{were not allowed to}} use it to borrow money to buy land until 1850). The result was that the large landowners obtained larger estates, and many peasants became landless tenants, or moved to the cities or to America. The other German states imitated Prussia after 1815. In sharp contrast to the violence that characterized land reform in the French Revolution, Germany handled it peacefully. In Schleswig the peasants, who had been influenced by the Enlightenment, played an active role; elsewhere they were largely passive. Indeed, for most peasants, customs and traditions continued largely unchanged, including the <b>old</b> <b>habits</b> of deference to the nobles whose legal authority remained quite strong over the villagers. Although the peasants were no longer tied to the same land as serfs had been, the old paternalistic relationship in East Prussia lasted into the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|After {{his return}} to Terre Haute in 1874, Dresser and his father resumed their hostile relationship. Dresser also resumed to his <b>old</b> <b>habits</b> of {{spending}} time with delinquents and drinking. At age sixteen Dresser {{took a job as}} a teacher and musician at a Catholic church in Brazil, Indiana, but left after less than a year. Shortly thereafter, Charley Kelly, a traveling minstrel, hired Dresser to join his act as a piano player. The two traveled around southern Indiana, playing wherever they could to earn a meager income. After a few months, Kelly disappeared with their money during a show, leaving Dresser with no funds to pay their lodging or food bills. Dresser spent two days in jail as punishment. After his release Dresser went to Indianapolis in search of work and was reunited with his mentor, Father Alerding, who had been recently moved to the city. Although Dresser was only a teen, Alerding gave him a job as a teacher at St. Joseph Catholic Church. In 1876, after he had taught for a full year, Dresser returned to his family in Terre Haute. Almost immediately he resumed his old way of life and spent most of his savings on liquor at a local bar. As his money ran low, Dresser turned to crime, robbing two saloons of whiskey and cash after they had closed for the night. Dresser was jailed for ten weeks before his trial, convicted, fined, and sentenced to another month of jail time. Released in June 1876, Dresser, who was not yet twenty years old, returned to his parents' home in disgrace.|$|E
25|$|The 2014–15 {{season was}} Arsenal's 23rd {{season in the}} Premier League and 95th {{consecutive}} season in the top flight of English football. This season Arsenal participated in the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, Community Shield and the UEFA Champions League. An inconsistent start to the league season ended any realistic hopes for the Premier League title as Arsenal only won two out of their first eight games. Inconsistency plagued Arsenal throughout {{the first half of}} the campaign, not helped by numerous injuries to important players. At one stage, Arsenal were as low as eighth heading into early December. This would later haunt them as they mounted a superb recovery during the second half of the season where they won eight league games in a row, becoming the in-form side of the division. Ultimately, however, the gap between themselves and leaders Chelsea was too much, the points dropped during the inconsistent first half of the season proving too much to recover. <b>Old</b> <b>habits</b> were hard to eradicate in Europe as yet again, Arsenal were their own worst enemies. Despite being widely expected to reach the quarter-finals, having been given a favourable draw in the Round of 16 against AS Monaco, Arsenal self-destructed at home, where panic led to Monaco winning the first leg 1–3, a scoreline which ultimately proved fatal over the course of the tie. Arsenal, with their 0–2 away win proving useless, bowed out yet again in the round of sixteen for the fifth consecutive year. However, Arsenal reclaimed the FA Cup, thus becoming the most successful club in the history of the competition with twelve wins, comfortably beating Aston Villa 4–0 in the final. Arsenal finished the league season in third, thereby qualifying directly to Champions league group stage and avoiding the Champions League qualifier, something Arsène Wenger was keen to avoid as he felt it had a negative impact on competing for the Premier League title, which was the primary target set by the players, manager and coaching staff, going into the next season.|$|E

Tiny Mix Tapes pointed out that the song's lyrics use [...] "clumsy analogies". Batey found B.o.B's attitude and rapping verses care free, in which you can almost hear him smiling. David Jeffries had a different opinion, stating that the rapper [...] "courts the ladies" [...] on the song along with Mars.

[...] The return of Georgina Sparks was well-received as with Serena's development, with Berman citing Serena's confession with Charlie before she could plunge to her death. [...] "This debacle, along with the events of this season in general, seems to have given S some perspective. Friends, she apologizes to Nate and Dan for leading them on and confesses to Charlie that her decision-making skills leave something to be desired! Even if lazy writing results in Serena falling into <b>old</b> <b>habits</b> next season, it's a pretty gratifying moment." [...] Berman also questioned Vanessa's motive behind publishing Dan's novel [...] "it's impossible to know whether she's trying to do her old friend one last favor or profit from stirring up more drama in his life. Considering that Jessica Szohr won't be returning to the show in the fall, we may never find out." [...] Berman also complimented the casting of director David O Russell calling it [...] "one of the show's most delightfully random cameos ever". New York Magazine labeled Chuck and Blair's relationship as the [...] "Longest-Delayed Breakup" [...] of the season, adding that [...] "the big news was that Blair and Prince Louis are somehow still together and engaged, with the wedding scheduled for November sweeps.
