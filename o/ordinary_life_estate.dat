40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} homologies between Wittgenstein's {{account of}} philosophical practice {{in both the}} Tractatus and the Investigations with accounts of practice in Zen. The chapter argues that both Wittgenstein and such Zen thinkers as Shunryu Suzuki regard philosophy as, at one level, indicating that ordinary practice, ordinary language, and <b>ordinary</b> <b>life</b> are “in order” as they are—requiring neither critique nor validation by philosophy—while, at another, they regard philosophical insight as necessary to living <b>ordinary</b> <b>life</b> in an enlightened way.

50|$|Many jurisdictions {{retain the}} {{possibility}} of creating a <b>life</b> <b>estate,</b> although this is uncommon. In the United States, <b>life</b> <b>estates</b> are most commonly used either to grant someone use of the property {{for the remainder of}} that person's life in a will, or by a grantor to reserve the right to continue using the property {{for the remainder of the}} grantor's life after it is sold. The right to ownership of the property after the death of the <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> owner is called the remainder estate. In England and Wales fee simple is the only freehold estate that remains; a <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> can only be created in equity and is not a right in property.|$|R
