40|$|This {{document}} {{presents the}} experimental results for validating the <b>Ordering</b> <b>Key</b> DS (DS 5) {{in the context}} of the core experiment of the Weight DS [6]. At the Melbourne MPEG meeting, in October 1999, the aforementioned core/validation experiment was planned in order to show the validity of a set of proposals (Weight DS [5], Descriptor Usage DS [8], Fidelity DS [9], Pointofview DS [4] and <b>Ordering</b> <b>Key</b> DS [7]). In a few words, all these DSs play the role of highlighting, by means of some kinds of weights, description information (DSs or Ds) relevant to user queries. They can provide, for example, confidence measure, priority, fidelity, relevance feedback, information for ordering etc. in order to facilitate user queries and browsing. As we said, the document focuses on the VE of the <b>Ordering</b> <b>Key</b> DS. Besides it presents an unified DS, in MPEG- 7 DDL syntax, that addresses all the different functionalities proposed by the several DSs involved in the CE. In our case, the provided functionality deals with the concept of ordering, as we consider the need of providing users with ordering mechanisms a very relevant issue for MPEG- 7. Such ordering mechanisms are derivable from descriptors (e. g. a set of <b>key</b> – frames <b>ordered</b> on the basis a color descriptor or a set of sounds ordered by means of an audio loudness D). However a possible large variety in the types of descriptors composing a description could lead to a consequent high number of ordering criteria to arrange description items. Therefore we propose that the description provider (it could be different from the content provider) should also select a reduced set of descriptors allowing to order a subset of description elements (e. g. key frames, events etc.) pertinent to the MM document being described [7]. This contribution is organized as follows. In Section 2, the motivations for introducing <b>Ordering</b> <b>Key</b> DS in the Generic AV DS are given. Section 3 briefly presents the structure of the <b>Ordering</b> <b>Key</b> DS by means of UML notation and MPEG- 7 DDL as well. Moreover the section discusses about the possible locations of the DS within the Generic AV DS. In Section 4 is shown the output of the experiment: a smart browsing of ordered elements belonging to the test set of MPEG- 7 video material. Finally, in Section 5, is proposed a unified DDL structure for the DSs involved in the CE...|$|R
