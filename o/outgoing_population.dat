25|$|Many {{of these}} African Americans live in quiet, middle class {{suburban}} neighborhoods near the Nassau County border, such as Laurelton and Cambria Heights which have large black populations whose family income {{is higher than}} average. The migration of European Americans from parts of Queens has been long ongoing with departures from Ozone Park, Woodhaven, Bellerose, Floral Park, and Flushing, etc. (most of the <b>outgoing</b> <b>population</b> has been replaced with Asian Americans). Neighborhoods such as Whitestone, College Point, North Flushing, Auburndale, Bayside, Middle Village, Little Neck, and Douglaston {{have not had a}} substantial exodus of white residents, but have seen an increase of Asian population, mostly Chinese and Korean. Queens has experienced a real estate boom making most of its neighborhoods very desirable {{for people who want to}} reside near Manhattan in a less urban setting.|$|E
50|$|The {{median income}} for a {{household}} {{in the county}} was $37,439, and the median income for a family was $42,608. Males had a median income of $30,576 versus $26,628 for females. The per capita income for the county was $19,222. About 16.9% of families and 24.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 18.8% of those under age 18 and 13.0% of those age 65 or over. In Queens, the black population earns more than whites on average.Many of these African Americans live in quiet, middle class suburban neighborhoods near the Nassau County border, such as Laurelton and Cambria Heights which have large black populations whose family income is higher than average. Those areas {{are known for their}} well kept homes, suburban feel, and low crime rate.

30|$|Mainstreaming {{migration}} into {{urban planning}} requires looking into both the mobility effects of planning decisions and the planning implications of accommodating demographic changes linked to migration. Land use, its changes, infrastructural developments, and, more in general, investments, both {{in urban areas}} and in more or less distant locations produce changes in people’s distribution and mobility. These effects need to be understood and taken into account to make sure institutions and markets have sufficient capacity to meet cities’ needs in terms of housing and infrastructure, essential services, and opportunities. This can be done, for instance, through quantitative assessments and scenarios that estimate incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>population</b> flows {{as a consequence of}} urban development and investments, and inform planning choices for local authorities and markets (IOM 2015 c; Lee and Holme 2015). This also requires promoting the use of tools to understand existing and future cultural diversity in a city area, and that allow planning for the delivery of culturally appropriate services to a shifting demographic reality (Robinson 2015).|$|E
30|$|Calls {{volume is}} {{aggregated}} into two spatial interaction matrices {{to examine the}} frequency of communication between administrative units. These aggregations are made at the 50 -district level, and the 235 -prefecture levels (where prefectures are nested within districts), based on {{the location of the}} cell tower within administrative boundaries. If the cell tower location falls within the boundaries of these administrative units, their call data (number of incoming calls, number of <b>outgoing</b> calls, and <b>population)</b> is summed within the unit.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the migration}} processes and {{their influence on}} the transformation of multiethnic population structure in the Kaliningrad region. The author uses official statistics (current statistics and census data), as well as interviews with the representatives of ethnic cultural associations as information sources. Special {{attention is paid to}} the migration features associated with different ethnic groups. The author identifies major reasons behind the incoming and <b>outgoing</b> movement of <b>population.</b> In the post-Soviet period the Kaliningrad region has experienced positive net migration. This active migration into the region has contributed to the development of "migration networks" and established a new basis for further population increase through migration. The article describes changes in the regional multiethnic population structure and identifies key factors behind them. It is concluded that migration has played the decisive role in the process of multiethnic population structure transformation in the Kaliningrad region in the post-Soviet period. The author views migration as a serious test for both the migrants and the receiving society. On the one hand, migrants have to adapt to a different national, cultural, and linguistic environment and look for the ways of successful integration into the receiving society. On the other hand, the receiving society also faces a serious transformation {{as a result of the}} changing population size and structure, the emergence of new elements in culture, rules of behaviour, and the development of new attitudes...|$|R
