5|$|Magnetometers detect minute {{deviations}} in the Earth's {{magnetic field}} caused by iron artifacts, kilns, {{some types of}} stone structures, and even ditches and middens in archaeological geophysics. Using magnetic instruments adapted from airborne magnetic anomaly detectors developed during World War II to detect submarines, the magnetic variations across the <b>ocean</b> <b>floor</b> have been mapped. Basalt — the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the <b>ocean</b> <b>floor</b> — contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners {{as early as the}} late 18th century. More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these magnetic variations have provided another means to study the deep <b>ocean</b> <b>floor.</b> When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials record the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E

50|$|Chemotrophs are {{organisms that}} obtain energy by the {{oxidation}} of electron donors in their environments. These molecules can be organic (chemoorganotrophs) or inorganic (chemolithotrophs). The chemotroph designation {{is in contrast}} to phototrophs, which utilize solar energy. Chemotrophs can be either autotrophic or heterotrophic. Chemotrophs are commonly found in <b>ocean</b> <b>floors</b> where sunlight cannot reach them because they are not dependent on solar energy. <b>Ocean</b> <b>floors</b> often contain underwater volcanos that can provide heat to substitute sunlight for warmth.|$|R
5|$|In 1986, the {{wreckage}} of an Avenger was found off the Florida coast during the search for {{the wreckage}} of the Space Shuttle Challenger. Aviation archaeologist Jon Myhre raised this wreck from the <b>ocean</b> <b>floor</b> in 1990. He mistakenly believed {{it was one of the}} missing planes.|$|E
5|$|Scotch bonnets are predators; {{they search}} for their food on sandy {{stretches}} of the <b>ocean</b> <b>floor,</b> where they consume echinoderms such as sand dollars, sea biscuits, and other sea urchins (such as Echinocardium cordatum), drilling into their tests {{with the aid of}} sulfuric acid.|$|E

5|$|In Darwin's global hypothesis, vast {{areas where}} the seabed was being {{elevated}} were marked by fringing reefs, sometimes around active volcanoes, and similarly huge {{areas where the}} <b>ocean</b> <b>floor</b> was subsiding were indicated by barrier reefs or atolls based on inactive volcanoes. These views received general support from deep sea drilling results in the 1980s. His idea that rising land would be balanced by subsidence in ocean areas has been superseded by modern plate tectonics, {{which he did not}} anticipate.|$|E

5|$|Seamounts provide {{habitats}} and spawning grounds for these larger animals, including numerous fish. Some species, including black oreo (Allocyttus niger) and blackstripe cardinalfish (Apogon nigrofasciatus), {{have been shown}} to occur more often on seamounts than anywhere else on the <b>ocean</b> <b>floor.</b> Marine mammals, sharks, tuna, and cephalopods all congregate over seamounts to feed, as well as some species of seabirds when the features are particularly shallow.|$|E
5|$|The geology of Shetland is complex, with {{numerous}} faults and fold axes. These islands are the northern outpost of the Caledonian orogeny, {{and there are}} outcrops of Lewisian, Dalradian and Moine metamorphic rocks with histories similar to their equivalents on the Scottish mainland. There are also Old Red Sandstone deposits and granite intrusions. The most distinctive features are the ultrabasic ophiolite, peridotite and gabbro on Unst and Fetlar, which are remnants of the Iapetus <b>Ocean</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Around 2 {{million tonnes}} of nickel are {{produced}} annually worldwide. The Philippines, Indonesia, Russia, Canada and Australia are the world's largest producers of nickel, {{as reported by}} the US Geological Survey. The largest deposits of nickel in non-Russian Europe are located in Finland and Greece. Identified land-based resources averaging 1% nickel or greater contain at least 130 million tons of nickel. About 60% is in laterites and 40% is in sulfide deposits. In addition, extensive deep-sea resources of nickel are in manganese crusts and nodules covering large areas of the <b>ocean</b> <b>floor,</b> particularly in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
50|$|Methane clathrate, {{also called}} methane hydrate, {{is a form}} of water ice that {{contains}} a large amount of methane within its crystal structure. Extremely large deposits of methane clathrate have been found under sediments on the <b>ocean</b> <b>floors</b> of Earth (estimated at 3000-11,000 Gton C).|$|R

50|$|It spawns in {{the spring}} and summer, usually between April and early July. A {{medium-sized}} female has been known to produce more than two million buoyant eggs. The young live near the surface until they are about 2 in (5 cm) long, and then seek out rocky <b>ocean</b> <b>floors</b> in deep water.|$|R
5|$|As {{technology}} improved, {{measurement of}} depth, {{latitude and longitude}} became more precise and it became possible to collect more or less continuous sets of data points. This allowed researchers to draw accurate and detailed maps of {{large areas of the}} <b>ocean</b> <b>floor.</b> Use of a continuously recording fathometer enabled Tolstoy & Ewing in the summer of 1947 to identify and describe the first abyssal plain. This plain, south of Newfoundland, is now known as the Sohm Abyssal Plain. Following this discovery many other examples were found in all the oceans.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{exterior}} devastation {{caused by the}} bow's descent and collision with the <b>ocean</b> <b>floor,</b> {{there are parts of}} the interior in reasonably good condition. The bow's slow flooding and its relatively smooth descent to the sea floor mitigated interior damage. The stairwell of the First-Class Grand Staircase between the Boat Deck and E Deck is an empty chasm within the wreck, providing a convenient point of access for ROVs. Dense rusticles hanging from the steel decking combined with the deep layers of silt that have accumulated in the interior make navigating the wreck disorienting.|$|E
5|$|Frauenlob {{spent her}} entire {{career in the}} {{reconnaissance}} forces of the High Seas Fleet. She saw action during World War I at the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914, where she badly damaged the British cruiser , and at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916. There, in a chaotic night engagement, Frauenlob {{was hit by a}} torpedo launched by , which caused the ship to capsize and sink with the vast majority of her crew. The wreck was discovered in 2000, and is in remarkably good condition, sitting upright on the <b>ocean</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, pearl hunting was the most common way of harvesting pearls. Divers manually pulled oysters from <b>ocean</b> <b>floors</b> and river bottoms and checked them individually for pearls. Not all mussels and oysters produce pearls. In a haul of three tons, only three or four oysters will produce perfect pearls.|$|R
50|$|During the 1950s and 1960s {{information}} about {{variations in the}} Earth's magnetic field was gathered largely by means of research vessels. But the complex routes of ocean cruises rendered the association of navigational data with magnetometer readings difficult. Only when data were plotted on a map did it become apparent that remarkably regular and continuous magnetic stripes appeared on the <b>ocean</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|R

5|$|Growth is slow, and the veligers {{are carried}} by the ocean {{currents}} for up to 14 weeks. As the veligers mature, they develop their first shell (the smooth protoconch) and turn into very small juvenile snails, at which point they sink to the <b>ocean</b> <b>floor.</b> As {{is the case in}} all shelled mollusks, the mantle is what secretes the shell; shell growth begins at what will later become the apex of the shell, and typically rotates clockwise. As the animal gradually matures, the mantle continues to secrete shell material. Scotch bonnets complete maturation in one to six years. However, some have lived more than six years.|$|E
5|$|Most young {{octopuses}} hatch as paralarvae and are planktonic {{for weeks}} to months, {{depending on the}} species and water temperature. They feed on copepods, arthropod larvae and other zooplankton, eventually settling on the <b>ocean</b> <b>floor</b> and developing directly into adults with no distinct metamorphoses that are present in other groups of mollusc larvae. Octopus species that produce larger eggs – including the southern blue-ringed, Caribbean reef, California two-spot, Eledone moschata and deep sea octopuses – {{do not have a}} paralarval stage, but hatch as benthic animals similar to the adults.|$|E
5|$|On April 13, 2017, NASA {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} possible hydrothermal activity on Enceladus' sub-surface <b>ocean</b> <b>floor.</b> In 2015, the Cassini probe made a close fly-by of Enceladus' south pole, flying within 48.3km (30mi) of the surface, {{as well as through}} a plume in the process. A mass spectrometer on the craft detected molecular hydrogen (H2) from the plume, and after months of analysis, the conclusion was made that the hydrogen was most likely the result of hydrothermal activity beneath the surface. It has been speculated that such activity could be a potential oasis of habitability.|$|E
50|$|It {{occurs in}} manganese-iron nodules on the Atlantic and Pacific <b>Ocean</b> <b>floors.</b> It {{is also found}} in the Baltic, White, and Kara Seas. Forms under high {{pressure}} conditions and reverts to goethite on exposure to surface conditions. It also occurs as cement and coatings on clasts in poorly drained soils and sediments, formed by the rapid oxidation of iron(II) oxide compounds.|$|R
25|$|Decomposition {{and decay}} of diatoms leads to organic and {{inorganic}} (in {{the form of}} silicates) sediment, the inorganic component of {{which can lead to}} a method of analyzing past marine environments by corings of <b>ocean</b> <b>floors</b> or bay muds, since the inorganic matter is embedded in deposition of clays and silts and forms a permanent geological record of such marine strata. (See siliceous ooze).|$|R
50|$|Multidimensional seismic data {{processing}} forms {{a major component}} of seismic profiling, a technique used in geophysical exploration. The technique itself has various applications, including mapping <b>ocean</b> <b>floors,</b> determining the structure of sediments, mapping subsurface currents and hydrocarbon exploration. Since geophysical data obtained in such techniques is a function of both space and time, multidimensional signal processing techniques may be better suited for processing such data.|$|R
