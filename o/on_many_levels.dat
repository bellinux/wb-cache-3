5|$|By {{the second}} {{decade of the}} 21st century, the overall {{consensus}} supported the position {{that there was only}} a single author who was writing either {{at the end of the}} 4th century or the beginning of the 5th century, and who was interested in blending contemporary issues (political, religious and social) into the lives of the 3rd century emperors. Further, that the author used the fictitious elements in the work to highlight references to other published works, such as to Cicero and Ammianus Marcellinus in a complex allegorical game. Despite these conundrums, it is the only continuous account in Latin for much of its period and is thus continually being re-evaluated, since modern historians are unwilling to abandon it as a unique source of possible information, despite its obvious untrustworthiness <b>on</b> <b>many</b> <b>levels.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rape was a {{widespread}} {{phenomenon in the}} East as German soldiers regularly committed violent sexual acts against Soviet women. Whole units were occasionally involved in the crime with upwards of one-third of the instances being gang-rape. Frequently {{in the case of}} Jewish women, they were immediately murdered following acts of sexual violence. Historian Birgit Beck emphasizes that military decrees, which served to authorize wholesale brutality <b>on</b> <b>many</b> <b>levels,</b> essentially destroyed the basis for any prosecution of sexual offenses committed by German soldiers in the East. She also contends that detection of such instances was limited by the fact that sexual violence was often inflicted in the context of billets in civilian housing.|$|E

Educated in English by white men in a frontier American environment, Ross spoke the Cherokee language poorly, but his bi-cultural background later allowed him to represent the Cherokee to the United States government.

25|$|Despite this {{inheritance}} of unresolved territorial disputes and numerous periods of muted hostility, the Argentine–Brazilian relationship was not defined by open hostility {{for most of}} the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. There was competition <b>on</b> <b>many</b> <b>levels,</b> and their respective defense policies reflected mutual suspicion, but their bilateral relationship was not adversarial. After the mid-1850s, neither country resorted to coercion or the use of force to resolve territorial disputes, and during the only general war {{that took place in the}} Plata region– the Paraguayan War (1864–1870)– Argentina and Brazil were allied against Paraguay.|$|E
25|$|After {{achieving}} {{independence from}} the Iberian crowns {{in the early nineteenth}} century, Argentina and Brazil inherited a series of unresolved territorial disputes from their colonial powers. The most serious breach in the relationship was the Cisplatine War (18251828), led by the Brazilian invasion and annexation of the Banda Oriental. Despite the numerous periods of muted hostility, the Argentine–Brazilian relationship was not defined by open hostility for most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. There was competition <b>on</b> <b>many</b> <b>levels,</b> and their respective defense policies reflected mutual suspicion, but the Brazilian economic rise in the 1980s led to the accommodation of Argentina as a secondary regional power and increasing cooperation.|$|E
25|$|The regular American {{army was}} very small at the time, with less than 7,500 men manning a total of 53 posts. It was spread thin, with the Canada–US border to guard, coastal fortifications to man, and especially, Indians to move west and then watch and keep {{separated}} from white settlers. Temporary needs for additional troops were filled by state and territory militias, and by self-organized volunteer units. As news and rumors of the fighting spread, action was taken <b>on</b> <b>many</b> <b>levels.</b> Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott was placed {{in charge of the}} war. Congress appropriated US$620,000 for the war. Volunteer companies began forming in Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina.

25|$|In the 1920s, the Rockefeller Foundation {{started a}} program to {{eradicate}} hookworm in Mexico. The program exemplified the time period's confidence in science as the solution for everything. This reliance on science was known as scientific neutrality. The Rockefeller Foundation program stated {{that there was a}} crucial correlation between the world of science, politics and international health policy. This heavy reliance of scientific neutrality contradicted the hookworm program's fundamental objective to invest in public health in order to develop better social conditions and to establish positive ties between the United States and Mexico. The Hookworm Campaign set the terms of the relationship between Mexico and the Rockefeller Foundation that persisted through subsequent programs including the development of a network of local public health departments. The importance of the hookworm campaign was to get a foot in the door and swiftly convince rural people of the value of public health work. The roles of the RF's hookworm campaign are characteristic of the policy paradoxes that emerge when science is summoned to drive policy. The campaign in Mexico served as a policy cauldron through which new knowledge could be demonstrated applicable to social and political problems <b>on</b> <b>many</b> <b>levels.</b>|$|E
25|$|Level 9, head of Section One. Accountable only to Oversight. A Vietnam veteran, former Lieutenant Paul L. Wolfe was {{recruited}} into Section One {{against his will}} just before the fall of Saigon. A shrewd and driven man, Operations eventually topples the founder and head of Section One, Adrian, seizing control of the organization himself. While giving {{lip service to the}} aims of Section — the eradication of terrorists and the protection of the innocent — Operations uses Section One as his own power base, gaining considerable control over dictators in many regions of the globe. This lust for power brings him into direct conflict with George, head of Oversight, who <b>on</b> <b>many</b> <b>levels</b> despises him, and even Adrian returns from her forced retirement to mount an unsuccessful coup attempt against Operations. He is also distrustful of Nikita, and even attempts to kill her on a number of occasions, but is grudgingly forced to accept her success at completing Section missions. (The same is also true of Operations' relationship to Michael, when he discovers Michael's romantic involvement with Nikita.) Operations and Madeline make for an effective partnership, though it includes a brief romance that sometimes causes complications.|$|E

Arcadelt has conferred upon this composition a quality which is very rare in sixteenth-century secular music, namely durability …" [...] The texture is mostly homophonic, {{with a hint of}} fauxbourdon in the harmony; the subject matter is erotic, with the orgasmic [...] "thousand deaths" [...] portrayed by a rising fourth figure in close imitation; brief bits of word-painting occur, {{such as the use of}} a flattened seventh on [...] "piangendo"; and the musical phrases overlap the lines of verse, blurring the formal division of the line, a technique known in music, as in poetry, as enjambment.|$|E

500|$|A {{social network}} {{is a social}} {{structure}} composed of individuals (or organizations) called [...] "nodes", which are tied (connected) {{by one or more}} specific types of interdependency, such as friendship, kinship, financial exchange, dislike, sexual relationships, or relationships of beliefs, knowledge or prestige. Social networks operate <b>on</b> <b>many</b> <b>levels,</b> from families up to the level of nations, and {{play a critical role in}} determining the way problems are solved, organizations are run, and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals. An underlying theoretical assumption of social network analysis is that groups are not necessarily the building blocks of society: the approach is open to studying less-bounded social systems, from non-local communities to networks of exchange. Drawing theoretically from relational sociology, social network analysis avoids treating individuals (persons, organizations, states) as discrete units of analysis, it focuses instead on how the structure of ties affects and constitutes individuals and their relationships. In contrast to analyses that assume that socialization into norms determines behaviour, network analysis looks to see the extent to which the structure and composition of ties affect norms. On the other hand, recent research by Omar Lizardo also demonstrates that network ties are shaped and created by previously existing cultural tastes. Social network theory is usually defined in formal mathematics and may include integration of geographical data into Sociomapping.|$|E
500|$|In July 1993, Briscos two-hour {{pilot was}} {{screened}} for television critics in Los Angeles.

Calling Brisco [...] "one of the best shows of the fall season", Jennifer Stevenson of the St. Petersburg Times praised the show's [...] "intelligent, satirical asides". Kay Gardella wrote in the New York Daily News that the pilot set itself [...] "apart from others of genre" [...] with its humorous script and sight gags. The Los Angeles Times called Brisco [...] "gratifying nonsense", and praised Campbell and the supporting cast for supplying humor without [...] "going over the top". Some critics, such as Walter Goodman of The New York Times and David Hiltbrand of People, found the supporting characters [...] "weakly cast" [...] and not as strong as Campbell in the lead. Other reviewers praised the overall look of the show, such as Todd Everett of Variety, who approved of the [...] "strong comic-book visual style" [...] and the pilot's high production values. Writing in the Washington Post, Tom Shales said that the pilot's production was [...] "more movielike than serieslike".|$|E
