A liquid is introduced into the reservoir then sucked through the capillary and measuring bulb. The liquid is allowed to travel back through the measuring bulb and the time it takes for the liquid to pass through two calibrated marks is a measure for viscosity. The Ubbelohde device has a third arm extending from the end of the capillary and open to the atmosphere.

50|$|These {{devices are}} {{also known as}} glass {{capillary}} <b>viscometers</b> or <b>Ostwald</b> <b>viscometers,</b> named after Wilhelm Ostwald. Another version is the Ubbelohde viscometer, which consists of a U-shaped glass tube held vertically in a controlled temperature bath. In one arm of the U is a vertical section of precise narrow bore (the capillary). Above there is a bulb, with it is another bulb lower down on the other arm. In use, liquid is drawn into the upper bulb by suction, then allowed to flow down through the capillary into the lower bulb. Two marks (one above and one below the upper bulb) indicate a known volume. The time taken for {{the level of the}} liquid to pass between these marks is proportional to the kinematic viscosity. Most commercial units are provided with a conversion factor, or can be calibrated by a fluid of known properties.The time required for the test liquid to flow through a capillary of a known diameter of a certain factor between two marked points is measured. By multiplying the time taken by the factor of the viscometer, the kinematic viscosity is obtained.|$|R

Solutions of different concentrations 0.2 – 1  % w/v, respectively, of non-irradiated and irradiated gelatin were prepared in de-ionized water at 30  °C temperature and maintained at that temperature {{in a water}} bath. The relative viscosity, ηrel of the solutions was determined at 30  °C with an automated solution viscometer (<b>Ostwald</b> <b>viscometer)</b> by measuring flow times of the pure solvent and polymer solutions.

40|$|Background Endothelial {{dysfunction}} {{and associated}} increased blood viscosity (BV) {{play an important}} role in the formation of atherosclerosis during inflammatory processes. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a biomarker of inflammation with an active role in endothelial dysfunction and development of atherosclerosis that is marked by degree of coronary stenosis (CS). The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship of BV and CRP with varying degrees of CS among coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. Methods This cross-sectional study involved 24 subjects taken consecutively among patients with CHD who underwent angiography. Blood viscosity levels were determined using an <b>Ostwald</b> <b>viscometer,</b> with reference limits of 1. 5 to 1. 72 (cP). C-reactive protein was determined by turbidimetric immunoassay, with a normal reference value of 50 % = significant stenosis. Data was analyzed using non-parametric Spearman correlation test. Results There were 17 male and 7 female subjects, with mean age of 55. 96 ± 7. 29 years. The angiography results were: non-significant stenosis in 2 subjects (8. 3 %), significant stenosis in 22 subjects (91. 7 %) and none with normal stenosis. Statistical analysis of the relationship of BV with degree of CS found a moderate significant positive relationship (r= 0. 549; p= 0. 005). A poor significant positive relationship was found between CRP and degree of CS (r= 0. 481; p= 0. 017). Conclusion Blood viscosity increased the degree of CS in CHD patients.

40|$|The {{specific}} gravity and viscosity of biodiesel fuels are key properties {{in determining the}} suitability for use of such fuels in diesel engines. Though generally {{higher than those of}} # 2 diesel fuel (DF 2), they have been mostly reduced by blending with DF 2 and preheating to achieve comparable values as DF 2. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of temperature and blending on {{specific gravity}} and viscosity of Jatropha methyl ester, and also investigate the effect of modifying Clements blending equation by substituting volume fraction for mass fraction. Correlation models were developed to predict the variation of specific gravity and viscosity with both temperature and % biodiesel in a blend. Blends of Jatropha methyl ester (JME) and DF 2 on volume basis were prepared and investigated in the temperature range 15 - 60 °C together with the pure fuels. Blends B 20, B 35, B 50 and B 75 were made. Specific gravity was determined using specific gravity method whereas viscosity was evaluated was determined using the <b>Ostwald</b> <b>viscometer.</b> Specific gravity of JME was found to be generally 4. 83 % higher than that of DF 2. Blending with DF 2 lowered the specific gravity significantly, and a correlation model was developed for use to approximate the specific gravity of any JME-DF 2 fuel blend. Preheating the fuels lowered the specific gravity as temperature increased. Correlation models were developed to predict the specific gravity of the test fuels as function of both temperature and amount of JME in the blend. Calculating specific gravity using the Specific gravity blending equation proposed by Clements was found to give results within ± 0. 5 % of the measured values with mass fraction replaced by volume fraction. The viscosity of JME was found to be 42. 09 % higher than that of DF 2. Blending with DF 2 resulted in significant viscosity reduction, which varied linearly with the amount of DF 2 in the blend. Correlation models were proposed to approximate the viscosity of any blend as a function temperature in the range from 15 °C to 60 °C, and as a function of % biodiesel. Results showed that blends with up to 50 % JME conformed to both specific gravity and viscosity without need of preheating...|$|E
