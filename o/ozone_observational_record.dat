40|$|Observations of the Earth's {{climate system}} {{over the last}} century show changes in the {{atmospheric}} properties that may be associated with human activities. Growing concerns about these changes, and the desire to predict future states of the climate system as well as its changes led inter alia {{to the development of the}} application of general circulation models of the atmosphere and oceans for these types of climate studies. In order to evaluate the correctness and trustworthiness of simulated climate change it is essential to compare modelled changes with observation wherever possible. This is especially important in regions where only little observational data are available, such as the remote Antarctic region. Data of surface and upper air temperatures, longwave radiation, mean sea level pressure, wind speed and sea ice concentration from <b>observational</b> <b>records</b> were compared to the output from a transient experiment of the CSIRO coupled ocean atmosphere sea ice general circulation model. Most of the observational data were taken from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis project that includes a data assimilation scheme in order to represent irregularly distributed observations onto a regular grid. The examination of changes in the data sets revealed a reasonable representation of observed climate change in the model although there are still many uncertainties in the modelled data as well as in <b>observational</b> <b>records.</b> The models coarse resolution and limited ability to parameterise physical processes result in the lack of confidence in the representation of smaller scale processes. Moreover, the differences between observation and model are often largest for variables that are difficult to observe directly. Many of the uncertainties originate from the shortage of data in the <b>observational</b> <b>record,</b> especially in the Antarctic region. Future improvements of both the <b>observational</b> <b>record</b> (in length and density) and the models (in resolution) are necessary to make confident statements about changes in the climate system...|$|R

40|$|The {{tropical}} intraseasonal 40 - to 50 -day oscillation (TIO) is {{the dominant}} component of variability in the tropical atmosphere with remarkable planetary-scale circulation generated as envelopes of complex multiscale processes. A new multiscale model is developed here that clearly demonstrates the fashion in which planetary-scale circulations sharing many features {{in common with the}} <b>observational</b> <b>record</b> for the TIO are generated on intraseasonal time scales through the upscale transfer of kinetic and thermal energy generated by wave trains of organized synoptic-scale circulations having features in common with observed superclusters. The appeal of the multiscale models developed below is their firm mathematical underpinnings, simplicity, and analytic tractability while remaining self-consistent with key features of the <b>observational</b> <b>record.</b> The results below demonstrate, in a transparent fashion, the central role of organized vertically tilted synoptic-scale circulations in generating a planetary circulation resembling the TIO...|$|R

30|$|To {{test the}} {{applicability}} of the prediction-correction approach (19) and (20), we use the following procedure: first, prior to the application of (19), an assimilation run is made with the longest available <b>observational</b> <b>record,</b> i.e. the Gauss coefficients from paleomagnetic and archeomagnetic data (Korte and Constable, 2005), historical magnetic data (Jackson et al., 2000), ground observatory and satellite data (Sabaka et al., 2004).

40|$|Avoiding ‘dangerous climate change’ by {{stabilization}} of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations at a desired level requires reducing {{the rate of}} anthropogenic carbon emissions {{so that they are}} balanced by uptake of carbon by the natural terrestrial and oceanic carbon cycles. Previous calculations of profiles of emissions which lead to stabilized CO 2 levels have assumed no impact of climate change on this natural carbon uptake. However, future climate change effects on the land carbon cycle are predicted to reduce its ability to act as a sink for anthropogenic carbon emissions and so quantification of this feedback is required to determine future permissible emissions. Here, we assess the impact of the climate-carbon cycle feedback and attempt to quantify its uncertainty due to both within-model parameter uncertainty and between-model structural uncertainty. We assess the use of observational constraints to reduce uncertainty in the future permissible emissions for climate stabilization and find that all realistic carbon cycle feedbacks consistent with the <b>observational</b> <b>record</b> give permissible emissions significantly less than previously assumed. However, the <b>observational</b> <b>record</b> proves to be insufficient to tightly constrain carbon cycle processes or future feedback strength with implications for climate-carbon cycle model evaluation. ...|$|R

40|$|In a {{changing}} climate, {{the impact of}} tropical cyclones on the United States Atlantic and Gulf Coasts will be affected both by how intense and how frequent these storms become. The <b>observational</b> <b>record</b> of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Basin is too short (A. D. 1851 to present) to allow for accurate assessment of low-frequency variability in storm activity. In order to overcome {{the limitations of the}} short <b>observational</b> <b>record,</b> we downscale four Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models to generate synthetic tropical cyclone data sets for the Atlantic Basin that span the interval of A. D. 850 – 2005. Using these long-term synthetic tropical cyclone data sets, we investigate the relationship between power dissipation and ocean temperature metrics, as well as the relationship between basin-wide and landfalling tropical cyclone count statistics over the past millennium. Contrary to previous studies, we find only a very weak relationship between power dissipation and main development region sea surface temperature in the Atlantic Basin. Consistent with previous studies, we find that basin-wide and landfalling tropical cyclone counts are significantly correlated with one another, lending further support for the use of paleohurricane landfall records to infer long-term basin-wide tropical cyclone trends.

40|$|The long <b>observational</b> <b>record</b> is {{critical}} {{to our understanding of}} the Earth s climate, but most observing systems were not developed with a climate objective in mind. As a result, tremendous efforts have gone into assessing and reprocessing the data records to improve their usefulness in climate studies.

Reanalyses have fostered significant research, yet reliable global trends in many physical fields are not yet attainable, despite significant advances in data assimilation and numerical modeling.
