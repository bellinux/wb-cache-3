40|$|IT {{has been}} {{frequently}} stated that {{many species of}} flies, including houseflies and blowflies, can be kept alive and healthy on a diet consisting only of <b>cane</b> <b>sugar</b> and water; on this {{they are able to}} live for the maximum length of time, which, {{in the case of the}} blowfly CaUiphora erythrocephala, is about 2 months at 270 C. Addition of protein is essential only for the development of the eggs, as it does not increase the duration of life and there is, indeed, evidence that it may have the contrary effect. Flies thus represent an excellent medium for studying problems of carbohydrate metabolism, and the present investigation deals particularly with two questions: what effect have substances <b>other</b> than <b>cane</b> <b>sugar</b> on the length of life of the fly, and to what extent does the presence and absence of enzymes in the gut account for the utilization or non-utilization of these various substances?

40|$|Transglutaminase is {{an enzyme}} that catalyses an acyl {{transfer}} reaction between γ-carboxamide groups of glutaminyl residues and lysine residues in proteins. Due to this property, this enzyme {{is used for}} enhancing textural properties of protein-rich food. The transglutaminase used as food additive is obtained by microorganisms, mainly by Streptoverticillium ladakanum. On the <b>other</b> hand, <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> molasses is a viscous liquid rich in noncrystallized carbohydrates (saccharose, glucose and fructose). In this work, the feasibility of using <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> molasses as a carbon source {{for the production of}} microbial transglutaminase by Streptoverticillium ladakanum NRRL 3191 has been studied. Carbon sources including <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> molasses (60 g of total sugars per L), glycerol (60 g/L) and their mixture in a ratio of 1 : 1 (30 g/L of each) were evaluated.
