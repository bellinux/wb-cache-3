5|$|Those changes worsened the magazine's problems. When {{the title}} was {{shortened}} to just HG, many longtime subscribers thought they were getting a new magazine and put it aside {{for the real thing}} to arrive. Most of those subscriptions were eventually canceled, and while some fashion advertisers came <b>over,</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magazine's traditional advertisers pulled out.|$|E
5|$|After {{suffering}} over 4,000 {{casualties in}} ten days, {{the failure of}} the last attack ended the 45th Division's role as the only combatant on the Chinese side. The UN forces had gained strong control <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area, with the remaining Chinese defenders trapped in tunnels under the UN positions. Despite the initial setbacks, Deng Hua, acting commander of the PVA, considered the situation a golden opportunity to bleed the US military white. In the strategy meeting held on the evening of October 25, the 15th Corps was ordered to retake the two hills regardless of the cost.|$|E
25|$|Australia toured England {{twice and}} South Africa once during this decade. Australia played 28 Test matches during this decade, winning 14 and losing 6. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> them were against England and only 3 against South Africa. 5 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Test matches had 8 ball <b>overs.</b> <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Test matches were {{timeless}} whereas there were 9 three day Test matches and 3 four day Test matches.|$|R

5|$|Agriculture, and to {{a lesser}} extent forestry, are the main sources of income <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> county of Carmarthenshire. On {{improved}} pastures, dairying is important and in the past, the presence of the railway enabled milk to be transported to the urban areas of England. The creamery at Whitland is now closed but milk processing still takes place at Newcastle Emlyn where mozzarella cheese is made. On upland pastures and marginal land, livestock rearing of cattle and sheep is the main agricultural activity. The estuaries of the Loughor and Towy provide pickings for the cockle industry.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, Douglas DC-8s {{were also}} taken into use. Pan American World Airways had flights to New York City from 1967 to 1973 and from 1976 to 1978. Braathens SAFE started taking {{delivery}} of Boeing 737-200s and Fokker F-28s in 1969, and these gradually took <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestic routes. In 1970, Air France and Swissair started flying to Fornebu from Paris and Zurich, respectively. They were supplemented by Aeroflot's Moscow route in 1972.|$|E
5|$|Ficus rubiginosas range {{spans the}} entire eastern {{coastline}} of Australia, {{from the top}} of the Cape York Peninsula in north Queensland to the vicinity of Bega on the south coast of New South Wales. The range extends westwards to Porcupine Gorge National Park in Queensland and the far western plains in New South Wales. F.rubiginosa f. rubiginosa and F.rubiginosa f. glabrescens are found <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> range, though the latter does not occur south past the New South Wales-Queensland border region. Lithophytic, hemiepiphytic and tree forms can be found together in local populations of plants.|$|E

5|$|Following the Metropolitan Police Act 1829 and the City of London Police Act 1839, {{the capital}} was policed by two forces, the Metropolitan Police, who held sway <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capital, and the City of London Police, who were {{responsible}} for law enforcement within the historic City boundaries. The events in Houndsditch in December 1910 fell into {{the purview of the}} City of London service, and the subsequent actions at Sidney Street in January 1911 were in the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan force. Both services came under the political control of the Home Secretary, who in 1911 was the 36-year-old rising politician Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, {{redevelopment}} began <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area {{above the}} platforms. The new buildings were named Embankment Place, a postmodern office and shopping complex designed by Terry Farrell and Partners. This development {{led to the}} replacement of almost {{the whole of the}} 1906 roof. The rear two spans of this structure – immediately adjacent to the existing concourse roof – were retained as part of an enlarged waiting area. In addition the original retaining side walls of the station which once supported it remain in near complete condition. The works were completed in November 1990. Most of the Embankment Place complex is office space, with a selection of restaurants on the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|Order in {{the streets}} broke down as rumours arose of {{suspicious}} foreigners setting fires. The fears of the homeless focused on the French and Dutch, England's enemies in the ongoing Second Anglo-Dutch War; these substantial immigrant groups became victims of lynchings and street violence. On Tuesday, the fire spread <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> City, destroying St Paul's Cathedral and leaping the River Fleet to threaten Charles II's court at Whitehall, while coordinated firefighting efforts were simultaneously mobilising. The battle to quench the fire is considered to have been won by two factors: the strong east winds died down, and the Tower of London garrison used gunpowder to create effective firebreaks to halt further spread eastward.|$|E
25|$|A Twenty20 charity {{match was}} held between Bangladesh and a New Zealand Cricket XI with {{the funds raised}} going to people {{affected}} by Cyclone Sidr; the International Cricket Council donated an additional US$250,000 to the funds at <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match. Asked to bat first, the New Zealand side had a slow start, having made just 19 runs for <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> two wickets after 5.3 <b>overs.</b> <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> batsmen seemed out of form and fell to injudicious shots, with an unbeaten 33 from James Marshall seeing the side through to 133 for seven from their 20 overs.|$|R
50|$|The eclipse was {{not visible}} in <b>the</b> East coast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States, South America and southernmost Mexico, Western Africa and western Europe.

50|$|Balough {{returned}} in 1982, posting a top-ten at the Coca-Cola 500, but was released after just five races. Joe Ruttman took <b>over</b> for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season, posting four top-fives before being replaced at Riverside by Jimmy Insolo.|$|R
5|$|Police {{work and}} {{criminal}} prosecutions {{relied heavily on}} confessions, witness testimony, and apprehending perpetrators {{in the act of}} committing an offence or in the possession of obvious physical evidence that clearly linked them to a crime. Forensic techniques, such as fingerprint analysis, were not in use. Policing in London was—and still is—divided between two forces: the Metropolitan Police with jurisdiction <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urban area, and the City of London Police with jurisdiction over about a square mile (2.9km2) of the city centre. The Home Secretary, a senior minister of the United Kingdom government, controlled the Metropolitan Police, whereas the City Police were responsible to the Corporation of London. Beat constables walked regular, timed routes.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis vulgaris (also {{known as}} chronic {{stationary}} psoriasis or plaque-like psoriasis) {{is the most}} common form and affects 85%–90% of people with psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis typically appears as raised areas of inflamed skin covered with silvery-white scaly skin. These areas are called plaques and are most commonly found on the elbows, knees, scalp, and back. Psoriatic erythroderma (erythrodermic psoriasis) involves widespread inflammation and exfoliation of the skin <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body surface. It may be accompanied by severe itching, swelling, and pain. It is often the result of an exacerbation of unstable plaque psoriasis, particularly following the abrupt withdrawal of systemic glucocorticoids. This form of psoriasis can be fatal as the extreme inflammation and exfoliation disrupt the body's ability to regulate temperature and perform barrier functions.|$|E
5|$|The {{east has}} a more {{continental}} climate: winters can be very cold and summers very warm, and longer dry periods can occur. Central and southern Germany are transition regions which vary from moderately oceanic to continental. In addition to the maritime and continental climates that predominate <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country, the Alpine regions in the extreme south and, to a lesser degree, {{some areas of the}} Central German Uplands have a mountain climate, with lower temperatures and more precipitation.|$|E
50|$|Oslo, <b>the</b> capital <b>of</b> Norway, has {{attracted}} {{people from all}} <b>over</b> Norway. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> immigrants settle here as well.

5|$|The tooth enamel is well {{preserved}} <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tooth. It {{consists of}} prisms—bundles of hydroxyapatite crystals—with an average diameter of 3.8m. Most are entirely {{surrounded by a}} sheath, but in some the sheath is open. The prisms are slightly curved toward the outer surface of the tooth. Between the prisms, and oriented at an angle of about 45° to them, are crystals of interprismatic material. On average, the prisms are 6.57μm apart, {{so that there are}} about 27,247 per mm2.|$|E
5|$|Under the Reform Act of 1832, a Parliamentary Borough was established. The Bolton {{constituency}} {{was represented}} by two Members of Parliament. The Parliamentary Borough continued until 1950 when it was abolished and replaced with two parliamentary constituencies, Bolton East and Bolton West, each with one Member of Parliament. In 1983 Bolton East was abolished and two new constituencies were created, Bolton North East, and Bolton South East covering most of the former Farnworth constituency. At the same time major boundary changes also took place to Bolton West, which took <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Westhoughton constituency. Under the town twinning scheme the local council have twinned Bolton with Le Mans in France, since 1967, and Paderborn in Germany, since 1975.|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} that, Theoktistos and Sergios Niketiates were sent on a {{campaign}} to recover Crete, which had been conquered in the 820s by Andalusian exiles. The expedition at first went well, as the Byzantine army landed and took control <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island, confining the Andalusians to their capital, Chandax. At this juncture, Theoktistos heard a rumour that in his absence, Theodora intended to raise her brother Bardas to the imperial throne. He hastily abandoned the army under Niketiates and returned to Constantinople, {{only to find the}} rumours false. Once in Constantinople, news arrived of an invasion of Asia Minor by Umar al-Aqta, emir of Malatya. Theoktistos was sent at the head of an army to confront him, but the resulting Battle of Mauropotamos ended in a Byzantine defeat. At the same time, the expeditionary corps left in Crete was defeated and almost annihilated by the Andalusians, who killed Niketiates.|$|E
50|$|In 1241, the Tartars invaded Hungary {{and killed}} Herzog Coloman on <b>the</b> river <b>of</b> Šaj. King Bela IV {{was on the}} retreat which enabled Ninoslav to restore control <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> Bosnia. <b>The</b> Tartars were fought off by the Croats, sending them back across Bosnia, {{bringing}} more destruction to the Bosnian land.|$|R
50|$|For several centuries, Khuzestan {{was part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{province}} <b>of</b> Mesopotamia and ruled by distant caliphs. <b>Over</b> time, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants adopted Islam. The Persian language absorbed thousands of Arabic loanwords and some Arabic syntax. The Persians in their turn {{had a deep}} influence on their Arab conquerors.|$|R
50|$|During <b>the</b> {{afternoon}} <b>of</b> 15 October, {{winds were}} very light <b>over</b> <b>most</b> parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UK. The pressure gradient was slack.

Over <b>the</b> Bay <b>of</b> Biscay, a depression was developing.|$|R
5|$|Alexander's 10-year {{campaign}} in Asia, and the Macedonian {{conquest of the}} Persian empire, were to become the stuff of legend. The Macedonian army campaigned in Asia Minor, the Levant, Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia and Persia, winning notable battles at the Granicus, the Issus and Gaugamela, before the final collapse of Darius's rule in 330 BC. Alexander thus became ruler of the extensive Persian domains, although his rule <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territory was far from secure. Alexander continued campaigning in central Asia in the following years, before crossing into the Indian sub-continent. However, the Macedonian army became increasingly unhappy, and eventually mutinied, forcing Alexander to turn back. Alexander spent his final years attempting to consolidate his empire and planning future campaigns but, probably exhausted by years of hard campaigning, he died in Babylon in 323 BC.|$|E
5|$|Donnchadh's {{territory}} lay {{in what is}} now Scotland {{south of}} the River Forth, a multi-ethnic region during the late 12th century. North of the Forth was the Gaelic kingdom of Scotland (Alba), which under its partially Normanised kings exercised direct or indirect control <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region to the south as far as the borders of Northumberland and Cumberland. Lothian and the Merse were the heartlands of {{the northern part of the}} old English Earldom of Northumbria, and in the late 12th century the people of these regions, as well as the people of Lauderdale, Eskdale, Liddesdale, and most of Teviotdale and Annandale, were English in language and regarded themselves as English by ethnicity, despite having been under the control of the king of the Scots for at least a century.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{of modern}} human {{habitation}} in Malaysia dates back 40,000years. In the Malay Peninsula, the first inhabitants {{are thought to}} be Negritos. Traders and settlers from India and China arrived as early as the first century AD, establishing trading ports and coastal towns {{in the second and third}} centuries. Their presence resulted in strong Indian and Chinese influences on the local cultures, and the people of the Malay Peninsula adopted the religions of Hinduism and Buddhism. Sanskrit inscriptions appear as early as the fourth or fifth century. The Kingdom of Langkasuka arose around the second century in the northern area of the Malay Peninsula, lasting until about the 15th century. Between the 7th and 13th centuries, much of the southern Malay Peninsula was part of the maritime Srivijayan empire. By the 13th and the 14th century, the Majapahit empire had successfully wrested control <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peninsula and the Malay Archipelago from Srivijaya. Islam began to spread among Malays in the 14th century. In the early 15th century, Parameswara, a runaway king of the former Kingdom of Singapura linked to the old Srivijayan court, founded the Malacca Sultanate. Melaka was an important commercial centre during this time, attracting trade from around the region.|$|E
