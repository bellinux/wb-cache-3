40|$|After the {{political}} transformation in Poland {{new opportunities for}} discovering {{the world have been}} opened to Polish citizens. Regions unavailable before 1989 are now a new geographic and cultural space to explore for Polish tourists and are the goal of <b>outbound</b> sightseeing <b>tourism.</b> Trips to the farthest places on the earth organized by travel agencies have a large number of participant despite very high prices. Information about Polish tourists activity in <b>outbound</b> sightseeing <b>tourism</b> were obtained through data analysis from sales leader in Polish tourism market. Each time the source of information was a civil-law contract for the provision of tourism services signed between the tour operator and the client. Obtained data lead to conclusions not only about tourist destinations and its seasonality but also on the impact of social and demographic factors on destinations of travel, length thereof and seasonality of trips chosen by tourists. Results of studies showed significant changes in <b>outbound</b> sightseeing <b>tourism</b> trends in Poland since 90 ’s of XX century. Still the biggest group of the tourists taking part in exotic tourism are wealthy citizens of the age of over 40 years, however, with participation of younger tourists increasing. Also, older tourists who used to choose destinations with well organized tourist infrastructure and stable political are more and more willing to visit places where standard of travel remains still quite low. According to forecasts exotic tourism destinations of Polish citizens will change together with actual trends and intensity of influence of exogenous and endogenous factors. It is assumed that global character of tourist space will have the same attributes for Poles as it has for every tourist traveling around the world – it will be available. Matylda Awedy...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{representations of}} Egypt and Turkey in brochures produced by tour operators for the British <b>outbound</b> packaged <b>tourism</b> market. It suggests that two specific 'phases' of Orientalist discourse are deployed in promotional materials {{on the two}} destinations. Turkey reiterates the discursive division of western 'reason and modernity' from eastern 'stasis and passivity' while Egypt re-enacts the material intervention of Europeans to generate and articulate particular kinds {{of knowledge about the}} Orient. It suggests that it is not simply the material existence of the destinations, but the occupation of specific historically contingent positions of 'sovereign subjectivity' from which to 'know' them that is offered to tourists...|$|R

40|$|Background: Medical {{tourism is}} the {{practice}} of traveling across international boundaries in order to access medical care. Residents of low-to-middle income countries with strained or inadequate health systems have long traveled to other countries in order to access procedures not available {{in their home countries}} and to take advantage of higher quality care elsewhere. In Mongolia, for example, residents are traveling to China, Japan, Thailand, South Korea, and other countries for care. As a result of this practice, there are concerns that travel abroad from Mongolia and other countries risks impoverishing patients and their families.   Methods: In this paper, we present findings from 15 interviews with Mongolian medical tourism stakeholders about the impacts of, causes of, and responses to <b>outbound</b> medical <b>tourism.</b> These findings were developed using a case study methodology that also relied on tours of health care facilities and informal discussions with citizens and other stakeholders during April, 2012.   Results: Based on these findings, health policy changes are needed to address the outflow of Mongolian medical tourists. Key areas for reform include increasing funding for the Mongolian health system and enhancing the efficient use of these funds, improving training opportunities and incentives for health workers, altering the local culture of care to be more supportive of patients, and addressing concerns of corruption and favouritism in the health system.   Conclusions: While these findings are specific to the Mongolian health system, other low-to-middle income countries experiencing <b>outbound</b> medical <b>tourism</b> will benefit from consideration of how these findings apply to their own contexts. As medical tourism is increasing in visibility globally, continued research on its impacts and context-specific policy responses are needed.  ...|$|R

The Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with selected tourism operators and Government officials to investigate their adoption of generic strategies for the marketing of spiritual tourism. The general observations of the study were that cost leadership and broad differentiation strategies seem to be more applicable to both public and private tourism operators in Pakistan.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of combination forecasts in comparison to individual forecasts. The empirical study focuses on the U.

The three combination methods examined in this study are the simple average combination method, the variance–covariance combination method, and the discounted mean square forecast error method. The empirical results suggest that combination forecasts overall {{play an important role in}} the improvement of forecasting accuracy in that they are superior to the best of the individual forecasts over different forecasting horizons. The variance–covariance combination method turns out to be the best among the three combination methods. Another finding is that the encompassing test does not significantly contribute to the improved accuracy of combination forecasts. This study provides robust evidence for the efficiency of combination forecasts. School of Hotel and Tourism Managemen...|$|R

40|$|In China, <b>outbound</b> <b>tourism</b> is {{a manifestation}} of soft power and is {{inextricably}} linked with politics. The Chinese government is seen to be exercising control and influence in shaping its <b>outbound</b> <b>tourism</b> development so that tourism is developed {{in line with the}} country’s political agenda. To comprehend China’s <b>outbound</b> <b>tourism,</b> it is as important not only to know the consumer needs and wants, but also to understand the policy and politics. There is ambiguity in China’s <b>outbound</b> <b>tourism</b> policy, and it lies not so much in the consumer area but in the politics and how tourism is treated as a form of diplomacy. The policy and politics often pose difficulties and barriers for those destinations that would like to develop the Chinese market. The present paper examines the political roles of Chinese <b>outbound</b> <b>tourism</b> and the impact of politics on tourism, using cases from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka. It was found that China uses <b>outbound</b> <b>tourism</b> to add clout to its soft power in dealing with diplomatic issues in the respective countries and regions.

40|$|In the United Kingdom, {{domestic}} {{mass tourism}} {{began in the}} mid- nineteenth century {{during a period of}} peace and increased prosperity. It was facilitated by the railways, that enabled the rapid movement of people in bulk, and later by mass production of the motor car. Similarly, international mass tourism emerged in Europe and North America after the second World War, with stability, increasing prosperity, and advances in air transport. Similar socio-economic and political conditions led first to mass domestic tourism and then international tourism in Japan and China, and in both the state played an explicit and supportive part in tourism development. In all cases, mass tourism increasingly attracted academic attention, as seen most recently in the explosion of studies (in English and Chinese) of inbound and <b>outbound</b> Chinese <b>tourism.</b> There have been calls for a new ‘paradigm’ to analyse the development of Asian (most notably Chinese) tourism, which raise crucial questions {{as to whether or not}} ‘science,’ ‘paradigms’ and tourism studies can or should be tailored to study mass tourism because of its increased importance in East Asia...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} a comprehensive {{comparison of the}} performance of the commonly used econometric and time-series models in forecasting seasonal tourism demand. The empirical study is carried out based on the demand for <b>outbound</b> leisure <b>tourism</b> by UK residents to seven destination countries: Australia, Canada, France, Greece, Italy, Spain and the USA. In the modelling exercise, the seasonality of the data is treated using the deterministic seasonal dummies, seasonal unit root test techniques and the unobservable component method. The empirical results suggest that no single forecasting technique is superior to the others in all situations. As far as overall forecast accuracy is concerned, the Johansen maximum likelihood error correction model outperforms the other models. The time-series models also show superior performance in dealing with seasonality. However, the time-varying parameter model performs relatively poorly in forecasting seasonal tourism demand. This empirical evidence suggests that the methods of seasonality treatment affect the forecasting performance of the models and that the pre-test for seasonal unit roots is necessary and can improve forecast accuracy.
