25|$|The inaugural {{installment}} of Exit was held around 100 days {{throughout the summer}} of 2000 on various stages set up between University of Novi Sad's Faculty of Philosophy building and the Danube's left bank. Initially the festival had a pronounced political component, representing, in effect, another form of anti-Milošević protest. Although, due to fear of government repression, its activism was thinly veiled {{under the guise of}} merely getting the youth interested in political process, the festival's ties with <b>Otpor!</b> and other forces pushing for regime change were clear to all that attended.|$|E
500|$|A group named <b>Otpor!,</b> {{originally}} {{formed by}} students in 1998 with the financial assistance of USAID, International Republican Institute, and NED, was one of multiple significant participants in the Bulldozer Revolution, from which Milošević was overthrown. USAID donated over $30 million for <b>Otpor</b> to [...] "purchase cell phones and computers for DOS's leadership and to recruit and train an army of 20,000 election monitors" [...] {{as well as to}} supplement them with [...] "a sophisticated marketing campaign with posters, badges and T-shirts." [...] After the Bulldozer Revolution on October 5, 2000, the United States reestablished a diplomatic presence in Belgrade. In 2013, the Associated Press published an article which reported that a CIA operative, Francis Archibald, participated in the organization of the October 5 coup and that the overthrow was [...] "regarded inside the CIA as a blueprint for running a successful peaceful covert action".|$|E
2500|$|The April 6 {{movement}} {{is using the}} same raised fist symbol as the <b>Otpor!</b> movement from Serbia, that helped bring down the regime of Slobodan Milošević and whose nonviolent tactics were later used in Ukraine and Georgia. [...] Mohammed Adel, {{a leader in the}} April 6 movement, studied at the Centre for Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies, an organization founded by former <b>Otpor!</b> members. [...] The movement was banned by an Egyptian court on 28 April 2014. [...] The Constitution Party condemned the verdict, arguing that the charges against the movement were [...] "false" [...] and that the court ruling was an example of state institutions undermining and destroying the rule of law. [...] Hamdeen Sabahi's presidential campaign warned of the [...] "return to a state of suppression and banning." [...] Abdul Ghaffar Shukr, vice president of the National Council for Human Rights, has stated that the council is prepared to stand in solidarity with the April 6 Youth Movement, and will aid the movement if it requests assistance. [...] Human Rights Watch condemned the ruling as [...] "a clear violation of citizens’ rights to free association, peaceful assembly, and free expression." [...] The April 6 movement has vowed to defy the ban, as well as attempt to repeal it.|$|E
5000|$|He's finished!: <b>Otpor's</b> most {{well-known}} campaign. Close to the elections, volunteers put up over 1,500,000 [...] "He's finished!" [...] (Gotov je! / Готов је!) stickers on existing posters of Milošević {{and all over}} cities.|$|R
50|$|In April 2008, {{during the}} {{election}} campaign ahead of the parliamentary election, the clenched fist was stenciled on several walls in Novi Sad. This led to an announcement of <b>Otpor's</b> reactivation by its former activist Nenad Šeguljev, however nothing ever came of it.|$|R
50|$|The {{official}} {{announcement of}} <b>Otpor's</b> transformation {{into a political}} party was made on 19 November 2003, days after the parliamentary elections had been set for 23 December. The party didn't name an official leader. However, cousins Slobodan Homen and Nenad Konstantinović played key roles. Asked about the new party's finances in November 2003, Konstantinović said it {{was funded by the}} Serbian companies.|$|R
2500|$|A {{number of}} the {{supporters}} of the counter-protests have voiced suspicions regarding the purported involvement (including the alleged offering of remuneration) of influential US-based activists and think tanks in providing impetus for the demonstrations, though this remains a fringe view among scholars. Similar conspiracy theories have been espoused by figures like Biser Milanov (who did not self-identify as a counter-protester, but was believed to fit this description by protest activists), who made a statement at the Council of Ministers in August 2013, in which he affirmed that his [...] "National Liberty" [...] movement would only support the government if it took adequate measures against [...] "paid protesters", entailing granting them permission to create [...] "volunteer patrols" [...] who would operate together with police officers and apprehend [...] "all protest organizers who are driven {{by a desire to}} promote George Soros' interests in Bulgaria". Rapper Mihail Mihaylov, who has been described in the media as [...] "one of the faces of the counter-protests", has in a similar fashion expressed dismay at the alleged meddling of outside agents in Bulgarian affairs and in addition to that criticized the Borisov Government for its supposed authoritarian tendencies, thus subscribing to the argument that GERB was bound to be the beneficiary of any anti-government protests. According to research conducted by the Sofia Open Society Institute covering the months of June and July, only 7.4% of respondents cited the concern that GERB could return to the helm of the country as being among their reasons for refusing to participate in a protest. Journalist Petar Volgin, who has been noted for his anti-protest philosophy in contrast to other media anchors, echoed some of the sentiments of the conspiracy theorists, maintaining that the spontaneity of the protests only persisted until about their fifth day, after which they were taken over by a collection of interested [...] "political engineers" [...] – right-wing activists, GERB affiliates and [...] "tipping point" [...] circles with close connections to selected oligarchs. Columnists associated with the Ataka party compare the protests to the <b>Otpor!</b> movement as well as the various colour revolutions that are also purported to have been sponsored by pro-US activists and NGOs that are claimed to promote undesirable political correctness norms in Eastern European countries. Thus, foreign agents were deemed capable of exerting an influence of the momentum and intensity of the protests, with one of the speculations being that the government's decision to implicitly give the green light regarding the construction of a 7th unit of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant (to be commissioned to American company Westinghouse), placated the pro-American NGOs in Bulgaria and brought about a dwindling in the protest waves. During the protests and following their cessation, Volen Siderov has referred to them as [...] "an attempt to pull off a Bulgarian Maidan". He has also alleged that Oresharski had a pang of conscience and decided to resign after refusing to accede to American demands (with the insistence to abandon South Stream being the only one to be made public) put forth during a meeting with John McCain in June 2014, which included (amongst others) providing the United States with a carte blanche to use Bulgarian military airports for the purpose of military and logistical actions in light of the Ukrainian crisis as well as sending Bulgarian troops to fight against the pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine. It has been alleged that parties such as BSP encouraged their supporters to flood Internet forums with anti-protest messages (attempting to divert discussions in the direction of conspiracy theories).|$|E
5000|$|During the 2000 electoral campaign, Kurepa {{traveled}} around Serbia with the students' movement <b>Otpor!.</b> <b>Otpor</b> awarded him a certificate, acknowledging him as [...] "the most resistive professor." ...|$|E
50|$|In the {{immediate}} months following 5th October Overthrow, <b>Otpor!</b> members were suddenly the widely praised heroes throughout FR Yugoslavia {{as well as}} in the eyes of Western governments. From the wide range of local celebrities and public figures seeking positive attention by wearing <b>Otpor!</b> T-shirts, to Partizan basketball club painting the <b>Otpor!</b> logo in the center circle for their FIBA Suproleague game, the clenched fist was omnipresent. This widespread popularity inspired even some individuals tied to the former government to become involved with the DOS authorities by praising <b>Otpor!</b> and its activities.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>Otpor!'s</b> {{symbol of}} the clenched fist by many {{grassroots}} movements around the world has encouraged rumors that they are directly affiliated with CANVAS. The symbol, however, is not patented and CANVAS has, in fact, welcomed the reuse of the symbol by resistance movements in any nonviolent struggle, including those with whom the organization has had no direct contact. Notably, the symbol has been utilized by activists in such countries as Russia, Venezuela, Serbia, Kenya, and Egypt.|$|R
50|$|CANVAS also {{views the}} {{creation}} of a strong brand with the potential to attract widespread support as key to a movement’s success. Slogans, songs and identity symbols - such as <b>Otpor!’s</b> clenched fist - all {{play an important role in}} this regard. Together with clear articulation of a movement’s aims, CANVAS's teachings cover topics including nonviolent movements` group identity, clear communication strategies with its target audiences and the development of solidarity among its activists in case they are arrested, detained or fired from their work. An important part of the curriculum is focused on how movements facing oppression can overcome fear and its adverse effects on people's morale and build enthusiasm.|$|R
5000|$|After {{two weeks}} of forced hiatus, the next issue of Dnevni telegraf came out on Saturday, 7 November 1998, {{featuring}} <b>Otpor!s</b> clenched fist logo {{on the front page}} along with the movements ad urging peaceful resistance to authorities. Regime reacted immediately. After forcing Politika AD to stop distributing Dnevni telegraf and Borba to revoke its printing privileges, it also pressed another private citation (prekršajna prijava). This time by one Bratislava Buba Morina of the [...] "Yugoslav Women Association" [...] (Savez žena Jugoslavije), yet another phantom organization. Ms. Morina alleged Dnevni telegraf [...] "attempted to violently destroy the constitutional order of Yugoslavia" [...] by running an ad that [...] "endangered women and children of Yugoslavia". In another quickie trial on 8 November 1998, the paper was slapped with a YUM1.2 million (US$120,000) fine. This would prove to be the final nail in its coffin as far as continuing to publish in Serbia went.|$|R

50|$|By late November 2000 {{information}} started appearing about substantial outside assistance <b>Otpor!</b> received {{leading up}} to the revolution. <b>Otpor!</b> was a recipient of substantial funds from U.S. government-affiliated organizations such as the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), International Republican Institute (IRI), and US Agency for International Development (USAID).|$|E

In {{the aftermath of}} NATO bombing, the organization began a political campaign aimed directly against the Yugoslav president Slobodan Milošević. This resulted in nationwide police repression against <b>Otpor!</b> activists, during which nearly 2,000 were arrested, some beaten.|$|E

50|$|<b>Otpor!</b> {{became one}} of the {{defining}} symbols of the anti-Milošević struggle and his subsequent overthrow. By aiming their activities at the pool of youth abstainers and other disillusioned voters, <b>Otpor!</b> contributed to one of the biggest turnouts ever for the 24 September 2000 federal presidential elections with more than 4,77 million votes (72% of the total electorate).|$|E
5000|$|During {{the presidential}} {{campaign}} of September 2000, <b>Otpor!</b> launched its [...] "Gotov je" [...] (He's Finished!) and the [...] "Vreme Je!" [...] (It's Time!) campaigns, which galvanized national discontent with Milošević and eventually resulted in his defeat. Some students who led <b>Otpor!</b> used Serbian translations of Gene Sharp's writings on nonviolent action as a theoretical basis for their campaigns.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{its members}} often proudly talked of the movement's [...] "horizontal command hierarchy" [...] and {{its lack of}} {{established}} leadership structure, <b>Otpor!</b> still exhibited a top-down organizational model with several members from its Belgrade central office clearly asserting themselves as the main decision makers. Their involvement in <b>Otpor!</b> served as a springboard to Serbian political, business, and NGO careers.|$|E
5000|$|Established in Belgrade in October 1998, <b>Otpor!</b> {{emerged as}} a {{response}} to the introduction that year of repressive laws relating to the universities and mass media. Following the war in Kosovo and NATO air-strikes in 1999, <b>Otpor!</b> began its political campaign against Milosevic throughout the country. Espousing the principle of nonviolence, it used an array of tactics, from slogans and chants to rock concerts and Monty Python street humour, to galvanise the Serbian population against Milosevic. <b>Otpor!</b> adopted as its symbol of resistance a clenched fist, black on white or white on black - a subversion of the communist imagery of a red fist which was favored by Milosevic. Duda Petrovic, who designed the symbol explained, [...] "I never knew it would be so important … I drew it not out of ideals, but because I was in love with the <b>Otpor</b> girl who asked me to do it." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Otpor!</b> {{operated}} {{on the basis}} of three principles: unity, planning, and nonviolent discipline.|$|E
50|$|By fall 1999 {{and early}} 2000, the Serbian {{opposition}} political parties, {{most notably the}} Democratic Party and the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO), realized the potency of Otpor's methods and the resonance of its message with the youth. Thus began the battle for control of <b>Otpor!</b> between DS and SPO. Since both parties already had {{a significant number of}} their youth wing members within <b>Otpor!,</b> this trend continued on a large scale with both DS and SPO (and other opposition parties as well) instructing their local chapters throughout Serbia to recruit party youth members en masse into <b>Otpor!.</b> As a result, Otpor's membership swelled into tens of thousands.|$|E
50|$|In {{its initial}} period, 1998-2000, <b>Otpor!</b> {{began as a}} civic protest group, {{eventually}} turning into a movement, which adopted the Narodni pokret (the People's Movement) title, against {{the policies of the}} Serbian authorities that were under the influence of Slobodan Milošević who at the time was President of Serbia and Montenegro. Following Milošević's overthrow in October 2000, <b>Otpor!</b> became a political watchdog organization monitoring the activities of the post-Milošević period of the DOS coalition. Finally, during fall 2003, <b>Otpor!</b> briefly became a political party which soon folded due to its failure to pass the 5% threshold needed get any seats in the Serbian parliament.|$|E
5000|$|Over {{a period}} of two years, <b>Otpor!</b> grew from a dozen or so {{students}} into a grassroots movement of over 70,000 people. <b>Otpor!</b> became one of the defining symbols of the anti-Milošević struggle and his subsequent overthrow. By aiming their activities at the pool of youth abstainers and other disillusioned voters, <b>Otpor</b> contributed to one of the biggest turnouts ever for the 24 September 2000 federal presidential elections with a turnout of more than 4,77 million voters or 72% of total electorate. Its campaign called [...] "He Is Finished!" [...] against Milosevic was seen by many as a key factor in his electoral defeat in September 2000 and subsequent overthrow.|$|E

50|$|In 1991, {{a former}} leader of <b>Otpor</b> joined the Croatian Ministry of Defence {{and used his}} {{underground}} connections to try to obtain weaponry {{at the time the}} Croatian War of Independence was starting. In August 1991, the U.S. Customs Service arrested four members of <b>Otpor</b> from Chicago for attempting to procure illegal weapons, including anti-aircraft missiles, and ship them to Croatia.|$|E
50|$|Persistent resistance, {{sympathetic}} media coverage, and {{the international}} attention it attracted allowed the <b>Otpor!</b> movement to finally pressure Milošević to step down from the presidency. Shortly after 5 October 2000 revolution, Popović left <b>Otpor!</b> to pursue a political career in Serbia, becoming a Democratic Party (DS) MP in the Serbian assembly {{as well as an}} environmental adviser to prime minister Zoran Đinđić.|$|E
5000|$|Daniel Calingaert, an {{official}} with IRI, said <b>Otpor!</b> received [...] "some of the US$1.8 million" [...] his institute spent in the country throughout 2000, but didn't specify the concrete figures. He also said he met <b>Otpor!</b> leaders [...] "seven to ten times" [...] in Montenegro (then part of FR Yugoslavia), and Hungary, beginning in October 1999. IRI particularly focused {{a lot of its}} attention on <b>Otpor!,</b> organizing a seminar on nonviolent resistance at the Hilton Hotel in Budapest during March 2000 and paying for about two dozen <b>Otpor!</b> leaders to attend it. Lectured by retired U.S. Army Colonel Robert Helvey, who did two tours of duty in the Vietnam War before devoting himself to study of nonviolent resistance methods around the world, including those used in Burma and the civil rights struggle in the American South, the Serbian students received training in such matters as how to organize a strike, how to communicate with symbols, how to overcome fear and how to undermine the authorities.|$|E
