The research involves carrying out simulations on their power consumption readings {{to set up a}} control system. The study discovers savings on all appliances under study to be 12. 8 % Kw, not minding occupancy rate of the building. Air-conditioners have the greatest impact of a 6 % Kw contribution on savings. This would lead to a substantial contribution when converted to pricing rates. The results from the study indicate that control measures should be extended to peak periods and power saving measures extended to more appliances...|$|R

40|$|Monitoring the {{progress}} of the European Union and its Member States towards the EU’s energy efficiency target is a crucial part of the mandatory process as defined <b>in</b> the Energy <b>Efficiency</b> Directive 2012 / 27 /EU. In this paper, we conduct index decomposition analyses to show the effects of both policies and autonomous developments driving the changes of primary energy consumption for the European Union (EU 28) and its Member States for the time period of 2000 to 2014, with a comparative analysis of Germany and Poland. These analyses are based on the logarithmic mean Divisia index methodology and primarily on data compiled by Eurostat. They are carried out on two levels, i. e. on the level of total primary energy consumption {{as well as on the}} level of primary energy consumption related to electricity generation. The first level examines the influences of changes in final energy consumption and changes within the energy conversion sector on primary energy consumption. With the second level, we provide insights into the effects of changes <b>in</b> <b>electricity</b> consumption and production. According to our first-level analysis, the consumption of primary energy in the EU 28 is primarily influenced by an increased share of electrical energy and the counteracting effect <b>of</b> rising <b>efficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>electricity</b> generation, induced by an increasing share of renewable energies. Furthermore, the reduction of final energy consumption had a significant decreasing influence on primary energy consumption in the European Union. The second level of our analysis regarding electricity generation shows that the increasing effect on primary energy consumption due to the rising consumption of electricity was mainly compensated by substituting nuclear and thermal power plants by renewable energy technologies...|$|R

40|$|Scope of the study: This study investigates {{concrete}} and realizable ways towards a Euro-pean <b>electricity</b> sector <b>in</b> {{line with the}} goal of keeping global warming below 2 °C. It analyzes the development of the <b>electricity</b> sector <b>in</b> the EU 27, Norway and Switzerland up to the year 2050. The study is carried out by the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research ISI for the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety. Focus: The study focuses on two major aspects. First of all, it provides a detailed picture of possible developments <b>in</b> the <b>electricity</b> sector with low carbon emissions and high diffusion of renewable electricity generation. The analysis is carried out on an hourly basis for three year-round meteorological datasets in order to ensure the reliability of the system. Secondly, the study analyzes the impacts <b>of</b> increased <b>efficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>electricity</b> consumption on the required infrastructure, the structure of the electricity supply and the cost of the system. Therefore, two scenarios are developed. Scenario A "High efficiency" presumes a very ambitious reduction of electricity demand, based on the ADAM study (Jochem & Schade 2009). The second Scenario B "Moderate efficiency" is based on the electricity demand of the TRANS-CSP study (DLR 2006), projecting higher <b>electricity</b> consumption than <b>in</b> Scenario A. In both scenarios, a cap of 75 Mt is applied to the average annual CO 2 emissions in 2050, relating to a 95 % reduction compared to 1990 levels. Both scenarios do not rely on additional nuclear capacity and CCS <b>in</b> the <b>electricity</b> sector, since both op-tions are connected with substantial political, economic and technical uncertainties. In both scenarios the given CO 2 target is achieved without relying on these technologies. Main findings: The study shows in detail that an ambitious greenhouse gas reduction can be achieved solely by high diffusion levels of renewable electricity generation of more than 90 %. A cost-efficient solution for the given task requires considerable increases in the transmission capacity of the electricity grid. The demand for additional storage capacity is limited if the electricity grid is strong enough and renewable electricity generation is adequate for the given emission cap. A balanced regional distribution of renewable generation leads to lower total system costs than a distribution which is based on minimization of RES-E generation costs. Increased efforts to reach a high <b>efficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>electricity</b> demand can be valuable, since lower demand reduces the cost of electricity supply considerably. This also includes less need for sometimes contested infrastructures such as power lines and electricity storage facilities...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in the Nordic power system have shown some negative trends that relate to all actors in the market. Overall increase in prices and periods with extremely high prices are observed and operational problems are encountered. These facts question the reliability and {{security of electricity supply}} and challenge the development of a smarter grid through which problems can be mitigated. Facing the situation described above the Norwegian Government has decided that advanced metering system (AMS) will be installed everywhere in the country by 2016. A main idea behind this action will be to stimulate energy savings and increase consumers’ knowledge on their electricity usage. The desired consequence of the installation, however, will be to open possibilities for demand response (change <b>in</b> consumers’ <b>electricity</b> usage patterns <b>in</b> response to price). This increased demand responsiveness can be a good solution to the existing operational problems. This thesis analyzes the effect of a demand response program that involves time-of-use pricing and remote load control of household heating equipment and sets the analysis in the general concept <b>of</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>in</b> the <b>electricity</b> market and all the benefits associated with it. The main focus has been to estimate the influence that automatic steering of waterborne space heating and electrical water heaters in combination with a tariff compiled of peak, off-peak and spot prices will have on Norwegian households’ electricity usage based on a pilot testing remotely controlled load shifting at Malvik Everk. For this purpose I have used econometrics to estimate substitution elasticity and a price-elasticity equivalent measure and have tried to compare the extent to which electricity consumption has been reduced and moved to other periods throughout the day. The estimation of substitution elasticity does not provide any statistically significant proof of shift from peak to off-peak usage as a response to prices charged. These results indicate that load reduction should be attributed specifically to RLC and not to price changes as prices and usage do not follow a particular correlation pattern during the hours neighboring the predefined peak periods. Price elasticity’s estimates prove to be highly significant and show that load during hours of RLC has been reduced simultaneously with the customers being charged peak prices. The resulting elasticities equal to - 0. 47 and - 0. 10 account for a much higher extent of price-responsive behavior as compared to previous studies that analyzed price elasticities. Results from demand response based pilots such as the one at Malvik Everk provide some important insights on what the opportunities for demand curtailment can be and on how load can be rescheduled. Estimation results indicate a big potential for RLC to contribute for reduction of consumption during hours corresponding with high-price periods. However, the true success of demand response programs will depend mainly on the introduction of adequate technological solutions, correct electricity pricing methods and a sound knowledge of the desired effects and their consequences...|$|R

40|$|The power {{industry}} has undergone significant restructuring {{throughout the world}} since the 1990 s. In particular, its traditional, vertically monopolistic structures have been reformed into competitive markets <b>in</b> pursuit <b>of</b> increased <b>efficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>electricity</b> production and utilization. However, along with market deregulation, power systems presently face severe challenges. One is power system stability, a problem that has attracted widespread concern because of severe blackouts experienced in the USA, the UK, Italy, and other countries. Another is that electricity market operation warrants more effective planning, management, and direction techniques due to the ever expanding large-scale interconnection of power grids. Moreover, many exterior constraints, such as environmental protection influences and associated government regulations, now {{need to be taken}} into consideration. All these have made existing challenges even more complex. One consequence is that more advanced power system data analysis methods are required in the deregulated, market-oriented environment. At the same time, the computational power of modern computers and the application of databases have facilitated the effective employment of new data analysis techniques. In this thesis, the reported research is directed at developing computational intelligence based techniques to solve several power system problems that emerge <b>in</b> deregulated <b>electricity</b> markets. Four major contributions are included in the thesis: a newly proposed quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization and self-adaptive learning scheme for radial basis function neural networks; online wavelet denoising techniques; electricity regional reference price forecasting methods <b>in</b> the <b>electricity</b> market; and power system security assessment approaches for deregulated markets, including fault analysis, voltage profile prediction under contingencies, and machine learning based load shedding scheme for voltage stability enhancement. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) inspired by biological evolution mechanisms have had great success in power system stability analysis and operation planning. Here, a new quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is proposed. Its inspiration stems from quantum computation theory, whose mechanism is totally different from those of original EAs. The benchmark data sets and economic load dispatch research results show that the QPSO improves on other versions of evolutionary algorithms in terms of both speed and accuracy. Compared to the original PSO, it greatly enhances the searching ability and efficiently manages system constraints. Then, fuzzy C-means (FCM) and QPSO are applied to train radial basis function (RBF) neural networks with the capacity to auto-configure the network structures and obtain the model parameters. The benchmark data sets test results suggest that the proposed training algorithms ensure good performance on data clustering, also improve training and generalization capabilities of RBF neural networks. Wavelet analysis has been widely used in signal estimation, classification, and compression. Denoising with traditional wavelet transforms always exhibits visual artefacts because of translation-variant. Furthermore, in most cases, wavelet denoising of real-time signals is actualized via offline processing which limits the efficacy of such real-time applications. In the present context, an online wavelet denoising method using a moving window technique is proposed. Problems that may occur in real-time wavelet denoising, such as border distortion and pseudo-Gibbs phenomena, are effectively solved by using window extension and window circle spinning methods. This provides an effective data pre-processing technique for the online application of other data analysis approaches. <b>In</b> a competitive <b>electricity</b> market, price forecasting is one of the essential functions required of a generation company and the system operator. It provides critical information for building up effective risk management plans by market participants, especially those companies that generate and retail electrical power. Here, an RBF neural network is adopted as a predictor of the electricity market regional reference price in the Australian national electricity market (NEM). Furthermore, the wavelet denoising technique is adopted to pre-process the historical price data. The promising network prediction performance with respect to price data demonstrates the <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> the proposed method, with real-time wavelet denoising making feasible the online application of the proposed price prediction method. Along with market deregulation, power system security assessment has attracted great concern from both academic and industry analysts, especially after several devastating blackouts in the USA, the UK, and Russia. This thesis goes on to propose an efficient composite method for cascading failure prevention comprising three major stages. Firstly, a hybrid method based on principal component analysis (PCA) and specific statistic measures is used to detect system faults. Secondly, the RBF neural network is then used for power network bus voltage profile prediction. Tests are carried out by means of the “N- 1 ” and “N- 1 - 1 ” methods applied in the New England power system through PSS/E dynamic simulations. Results show that system faults can be reliably detected and voltage profiles can be correctly predicted. In contrast to traditional methods involving phase calculation, this technique uses raw data from time domains and is computationally inexpensive in terms of both memory and speed for practical applications. This establishes a connection between power system fault analysis and cascading analysis. Finally, a multi-stage model predictive control (MPC) based load shedding scheme for ensuring power system voltage stability is proposed. It has been demonstrated that optimal action in the process of load shedding for voltage stability during emergencies can be achieved as a consequence. Based on above discussions, a framework for analysing power system voltage stability and ensuring its enhancement is proposed, with such a framework able to be used as an effective means of cascading failure analysis. In summary, the research reported in this thesis provides a composite framework for power system data analysis in a market environment. It covers advanced techniques of computational intelligence and machine learning, also proposes effective solutions for both the market operation and the system stability related problems facing today’s {{power industry}}...|$|R
