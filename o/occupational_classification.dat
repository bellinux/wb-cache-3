This paper considers the plausibility of the national historical shifts apparent from such gauges, and explores their comparative relation to alternative indications of work organisation, focusing on the experience of eleven advanced industrialised nations in the post-war period. It shows that whilst it is clear that in the cases of some nations such gauges meaningfully express at least the comparative extent of managerial hierarchies, it is equally clear that for other nations they do not. The paper concludes that <b>occupational</b> <b>classifications</b> are no basis for inferences about comparative developments in the extent of managerial hierarchies, still less work organisation...|$|R

40|$|New {{opportunities}} for social stratification research in Sweden: International <b>occupational</b> <b>classifications</b> and stratification measures over time The Swedish <b>occupational</b> <b>classifications</b> have {{in recent years}} been changed to {{a version of the}} international standard ISCO- 88 (COM), i. e. SSYK 96. As a consequence, a wide variety of internationally well-known stratification measures can be applied to Swedish data sets. In this article some tests of the validity of translation keys between the older national classifications and SSYK 96 are presented. The keys seem to work satisfactorily. Thus, it is possible to create long time-series with ISCO/SSYK and use these well-known stratification measures over time. Hence, the international interest in Swedish data sets, and empirical results based on these data sets, could rise. Moreover, in the article an empirical regularity, which is quite astonishing, is paid attention to; stratification measures based on different theoretical rationales indicate very similar hierarchies of occupations.

Job strain may not account for the observed social inequalities in CHD.

Direct care workers (DCW) had the second largest number of nonfatal occupational injuries and illnesses involving days away from work in 2002 and higher injury rates than the construction industry have been documented. Despite training efforts to prevent predominantly musculoskeletal disorders, DCWs continue to be injured on the job. Additionally, DCWs are grouped together into <b>occupational</b> <b>classifications</b> despite different demographic and work characteristics. This study explored the following research questions: Does the proportion of occupational injuries differ between <b>occupational</b> <b>classifications</b> of DCWs employed in western North Carolina? How do organizational climate, job satisfaction, occupational stress, safety climate, training and demographic indices predict injuries for DCWs in western North Carolina? ^ In October 2005, a survey instrument was administered at the Mountain Area Health Education Center (MAHEC) Nursing Assistant Training Day in Asheville, NC. Instrument scales included measures of organizational climate, job satisfaction, occupational stress, safety climate, training, and demographic indices. ^ Descriptive statistics were compiled to characterize the study population (n= 105). The Spearman coefficient {{was used to determine}} correlations among variables. The chi-square statistic tested differences in the proportion of injury and near-miss between <b>occupational</b> <b>classifications.</b> Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of the dependent variable injury. ^ The results of this study indicated that there is a difference in the proportion of injuries between nursing aides and home health aides (χ 2 = 4. 179, df= 1, p= 0. 041). Tenure was significantly associated with the following variables: age (rs= 0. 446, p 3 ̆c 0. 01), training (r s=- 0. 201, p 3 ̆c 0. 05), satisfaction (rs=- 0. 284, p 3 ̆c 0. 01), organizational climate (rs=- 0. 330, p 3 ̆c 0. 01), stress (rs=- 0. 284, p 3 ̆c 0. 01) and safety training frequency (rs= 0. 215, p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Last, when tenure was greater than one year, job satisfaction (Exp(B) = 0. 048, p= 0. 028) was identified as a predictor and when tenure was greater than three years, both job satisfaction (Exp(B) = 0. 002, p= 0. 033) and training (Exp(B) = 31. 821, p= 0. 044) were significant predictors of injury. ^ The identification of tenure and job satisfaction in relation to occupational injuries of direct care workers are new and intriguing findings ripe for further exploration. ...|$|R
