500|$|MSNBC's Patrick Enwright {{listed the}} episode as his ninth {{favorite}} in the show in 2007, saying it [...] "brilliantly skewers new-agey self-help gurus" [...] and adding that [...] "it's also noteworthy for clever pop-cultural references." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, described it as [...] "A very bizarre episode in which everyone just has a good time." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: [...] "A certified classic, 'Child' mocks the self-help field and makes a good point along the way. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> all this with scads of clever moments and becomes a great show. As one who works in psychology, it's hard to resist this program's spoofery." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of B+ and described Homer's escapades with the trampoline as [...] "the episode's brightest spot." [...] Turner described the Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner homage as [...] "one of the show's most overt and inspired tributes to the Warner cartoons." [...] Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 4.5 out of 5.|$|E
2500|$|Dershowitz {{is one of}} {{a number}} of {{scholars}} at Harvard Law School who have expressed their support for limited animal rights. In his Rights from Wrongs: A Secular Theory of the Origins of Rights (2004), he writes that, in order to avoid human beings treating each other the way we treat animals, we have made what he calls the [...] "somewhat arbitrary decision" [...] to single out our own species for different and better treatment. [...] "Does this subject us to the charge of speciesism? <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>it</b> <b>does,</b> and we cannot justify it, except by the fact that in the world in which we live, humans make the rules. That reality imposes on us a special responsibility to be fair and compassionate to those on whom we impose our rules. Hence the argument for animal rights." ...|$|E
2500|$|Joel Fineman treats Sonnet 65 as epideictic. [...] He injects cynicism {{into the}} Fair Youth sonnets, {{claiming}} that the speaker does not believe fully in the immortalizing power of his verse; that it is merely literary and ultimately unreal. [...] He treats the [...] "still" [...] in line 14 as wordplay, reading it to mean [...] "dead, unmoving" [...] rather than [...] "perpetual, eternal". [...] There is some scholarly debate over this point, though. [...] Carl Atkins, for example, writes that the reader is [...] "not to take the couplet's 'unless' seriously. [...] We {{are not expected to}} have any doubt that the 'miracle' of making the beloved shine brightly in black ink has might. [...] <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> - we have been told so before. [...] 'Who can hold back time?' the speaker asks. [...] 'No one, except me,' is the answer". Philip Martin tends toward agreement with Atkins, but refutes the suggestion that the reader is [...] "not to take the couplet's 'unless' seriously," [...] asserting instead that, [...] "the poem's ending is...deliberately and properly tentative". Murray Krieger agrees with Martin's point that, [...] "the end of 65 is stronger precisely because it is so tentative". [...] "The soft, almost non-consonantal 'how shall summer's honey breath hold out' [...] " [...] offers no resistance to Time's 'wrackful siege of batt'ring days'. Krieger suggests that while the sonnet does not resist Time through an assertion of strength, the concession of weakness by the placement of hope solely on a 'miracle,' offers an appeal against Time: [...] "May there not be a strength that arises precisely from the avoidance of it?".|$|E

2500|$|Off-screen, actress Lucy Speed {{had decided}} to leave the serial after playing Natalie for a year, as she was {{reportedly}} “freaked out” by the media attention she was receiving from being in such a high-profile show. In an interview with the ‘’Walford Gazette’’, Speed commented: “I was very frightened by it quite frankly and certainly unprepared for it. I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> come with the job of being on the show and {{you have to learn to}} deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to me at the time. I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me…But I also have to make it clear that from the beginning when I joined, I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured my initial one-year contract and then moved on…they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked. I tried to explain in the best way I could my reasons for leaving at the end of my contract and they ultimately understood, and so I left on good terms with them…I had some growing up to do and instinctively knew that growing up more or less in front of the British public for one year was enough!” ...|$|E

60|$|He {{had served}} the Captain {{for more than}} a year, and knew his duty. This he {{performed}} easily, as if it were natural to him.

60|$|The toady had {{scarcely}} {{uttered the}} word when a loud report rang out, and a pistol bullet cut {{its way through}} the mainsail of the Searchlight.

Parasakthi {{was a turning point}} in Tamil cinema, as until then most movies contained up to 55 songs and were mostly based on mythologies. Parasakthi was initially banned. When it was finally released in 1952 it emerged as a huge box office hit.

60|$|It {{has always}} been {{interesting}} to me to study the character, as well as I can {{do so in the}} brief opportunity generally afforded, of the servants who open to me the doors of houses. To a certain degree, although <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not do to apply this rule too rigidly, these persons indicate the characters of the dwellers in the house.

60|$|These were hinged {{down the}} middle so as to fold and become small enough to stow {{in the bottom of}} each boat when not in use. When {{unfolded}} and hung over the side, they presented a surface of resistance to the water much greater than that of an ordinary boat's keel, so that very little leeway indeed was made. By means of the steering-oar Captain Vane kept his boat advancing straight northward, while the kite was puffing in a north-westerly direction. The kite was thus compelled by the boat also to travel due north, though <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> so in a sidelong manner.|$|R

If they gave a dinner beyond their means, it is no business of mine. I hate a man who goes and eats a friend's meat, and then blabs the secrets of the mahogany. Such a man deserves never to be asked to dinner again; and though at the close of a London season that seems no great loss, and you sicken of a whitebait as you would of a whale--yet we must always remember that there's another season coming, and hold our tongues for the present.|$|E
6000|$|Of the {{pathological}} bearings of {{the study}} of yeast, and other such organisms, I have spoken elsewhere. It is certain that, in some animals, devastating epidemics are caused by fungi of low order--similar to those of which Torula is a sort of offshoot. It is certain that such diseases are propagated by contagion and infection, in just the same way as ordinary contagious and infectious diseases are propagated. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not follow from this, that all contagious and infectious diseases are caused by organisms of as definite and independent a character as the Torula; but, I think, it does follow that it is prudent and wise to satisfy one's self in each particular case, that the [...] "germ theory" [...] cannot and will not explain the facts, before having recourse to hypotheses which have no equal support from analogy.|$|E
60|$|If {{all this}} be valid, {{the idea of}} God is derived from a savage fallacy, though, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not follow that an idea is erroneous, because it was {{attained}} by mistaken processes and from false premises. That, however, is the inference which many minds are inclined to draw from the evolutionary hypothesis. But if the facts on which the savage reasoned are, some of them, rare, abnormal, and not scientifically accepted; if, in short, they are facts demonstrative of unrecognised human faculties, if these faculties raise a presumption that will, mind, and organism are less closely interdependent than science supposes, then the savage reasoning may contain {{an important element of}} rejected truth. It may even seem, at least, conceivable that certain factors in the conception of 'spirit' were not necessarily evolved as the anthropological hypothesis conceives them to have been.|$|E

60|$|Ralph {{was very}} much disturbed; it was seldom that his sister snapped at him. He could see, now that he {{considered}} the matter, that Miriam had been somewhat neglected.

He believed he could <b>do</b> <b>it</b> without making it appear a matter of any great importance. It was important, however, for he should very much dislike to see ill will grow up between Miriam and Miss Bannister.

Yes, Boston is very narrow, but she has such a good opinion of herself that she can't see it. A man who has traveled as much as I have, and seen {{as much of the}} world, sees it plain enough, but he can't cure it, you know, so the best is to leave it and seek a sphere which is more in harmony with his tastes and culture.

6000|$|To this Mrs Foster replied, in an absent way, {{that she}} didn't know, {{that it was}} quite beyond her comprehension, {{and that she was}} utterly perplexed; but that she would find it out, if she should sit all night over it.

But how far the rain might finally go, we did not stay to see: we had fled from the [...] "anguish of the solstice," [...] as we had felt it in London, {{and by the time the}} first shower insinuated itself we were in the heart of the Malvern Hills.|$|R
