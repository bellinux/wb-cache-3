25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Belle Époque, the horse-drawn omnibus was the primary means of public transport. In 1855, Haussmann consolidated ten private omnibus companies into a single company, the C.G.O. (Compagnie générale des Omnibus) and gave it the monopoly on public transport. The coaches of the CGO carried twenty-four to twenty-six passengers and ran on thirty-one different lines. The <b>omnibus</b> <b>system</b> was overwhelmed by the number of visitors at the 1867 Exposition, thus the city began to develop a new system of tramways in 1873. The omnibus continued to run, with larger cars that could carry forty passengers in 1880, and then, in 1888-89, a lighter vehicle that could carry thirty passengers, called an omnibus à impériale. The horse-drawn tramway gradually replaced the horse-drawn omnibus. In 1906, the first motorized omnibuses began to run on Paris streets. The last horse-drawn omnibus run took place on January 11, 1913 between Saint-Sulpice and La Villette.|$|E

The latter was a private community that opened at 80 Rue Taitbout, which had forty-six apartments and three artists' studios.

60|$|Indeed, {{the things}} that {{interested}} Summers Minor, and {{the things that}} did not interest him, had mystified and amused his uncle for several hours. He exhibited the English schoolboy's startling ignorance and startling knowledge--knowledge of some special classification in which he can generally correct and confound his elders. He considered himself entitled, at Hampton Court on a holiday, to forget the very names of Cardinal Wolsey or William of Orange; but he could hardly be dragged from some details about the arrangement of the electric bells in the neighboring hotel. He was solidly dazed by Westminster Abbey, which is not so unnatural since that church became the lumber room of the larger and less successful statuary of the eighteenth century. But he had a magic and minute knowledge of the Westminster omnibuses, and indeed of the whole <b>omnibus</b> <b>system</b> of London, the colors and numbers of which he knew as a herald knows heraldry. He would cry out against a momentary confusion between a light-green Paddington and a dark-green Bayswater vehicle, as his uncle would at the identification of a Greek ikon and a Roman image.|$|E
50|$|Cardiff Bus is the {{dominant}} bus operator in Cardiff and also serves Penarth, Sully, Barry and Llantwit Major. Its network consists of 64 routes using Scania OmniCity, Scania N230UD, East Lancs Olympus and bendy buses, Adl Enviro 200 Enviro 300 and Enviro 400 MMC, also use Dennis dart MPDs LMPDs and SPDs and Mercedes-Benz Citaros are also used. Cardiff Bus carries 100,000 passengers daily, has a turnover of £27million and employs around 720 people. The fleet and drivers are managed against a timetable using software systems supplied by UK based software supplier <b>Omnibus</b> <b>Systems,</b> which allows the real-time digital information displays positioned at many stops around the city, to inform people when the next bus is due and alerting waiting passengers of any delays. Raised kerbs have been installed at the majority of stops.|$|R

50|$|In 1925, time {{synchronisation}} {{began to}} be relayed through <b>omnibus</b> telephone <b>systems</b> and control circuits to organisations that needed to know the precise time. This continued until the 1940s, when time signals {{began to be}} broadcast using the radio by the government. Briefly during World War II, clocks under Indian Standard Time were advanced by one hour, referred to as War Time. This provision lasted from September 1, 1942 to October 14, 1945.|$|R
50|$|Rather, {{there was}} - it is {{believed}} - a horse tramway which ran from quarries {{just north of the}} city to the construction site of Government House situated in St Georges Terrace. For how long the horse tramway survived is not known, nor its exact route, as information has not yet been found, although research continues. It is known, however, that a horse <b>omnibus</b> <b>system</b> did exist.|$|E

The last horse-drawn omnibus run took place on January 11, 1913 between Saint-Sulpice and La Villette.The horse-drawn tramway, running on a track flush with the street, had been introduced in New York in 1832. A French engineer living in New York, Loubat, brought the idea to Paris and opened the first tramway line in Paris, between the Place de la Concorde and the Barrière de Passy in November 1853. He extended the line, known as the Chemin de fer américain ("American rail line"), all the way across Paris from Boulogne to Vincennes in 1856. But then it was purchased by the CGO, the main omnibus line, and remained simply a curiosity. Only in 1873 did the tramway begin to gain importance, when the CGO lost its monopoly on city transport and two new companies, Tramways Nord and Tramways Sud, one financed by Belgian banks and the other by British banks, began operating from the center of Paris to the suburbs. The CGO responded by opening two new lines, one from the Louvre to Vincennes, the other following the line of fortifications around the city. By 1878, forty different lines were operating, half by the CGO. The companies tried a brief experiment with steam-powered tramways in 1876, but abandoned them in 1878. The electric-powered tramway, in service in Berlin since 1881, did not arrive in Paris until 1898, with a line from Saint-Denis to the Madeleine.|$|E
50|$|Even {{before the}} Fifth Avenue company began {{operating}} its coaches, the New York and Harlem Railroad was operating its Fourth and Madison Avenues Line of horse cars, later trolleys, mainly on Fourth Avenue below and Madison Avenue above 42nd Street (Grand Central Terminal). The Madison Avenue Coach Company, a New York Railways subsidiary, started operating replacement buses on February 1, 1935. Several {{changes were made}} to the route: instead of the Bowery, a shorter alignment via Centre Street and Lafayette Street was used, and a variant stayed on Madison Avenue south to 26th Street and short-turned at Astor Place. As part of the New York City <b>Omnibus</b> Corporation <b>system</b> (NYCO; also a New York Railways subsidiary), these two routes were numbered 1 (via Park Avenue) and 2 (short-turn via Madison Avenue).|$|R
40|$|Managing casino {{revenue is}} a {{complicated}} task, given the numerous factors that constitute the revenue equation. In this article, we propose a mechanism to apply revenue management (RM) principles to gaming pricing based on improved forecasting. We demonstrate that casinos can increase their net win by applying RM to their table games. Casinos already apply RM to their rooms division, and the approach for gaming would operate in similar fashion. The casino must determine how to maximize revenue or yield by “allocating the right type of capacity to {{the right kind of}} customer at the right price ” (Kimes 1989, p. 15). Implementing an <b>omnibus</b> hotel RM <b>system</b> helped improve gaming win per room across the Harrah’s chain by 15 percent, because reservationists could decide what rate to charge each customer for a room or even turn awa...|$|R
5000|$|Typically, Train Controllers were {{stationed}} at district or [...] "divisional" [...] control offices which were linked by <b>omnibus</b> circuit telephone <b>systems</b> with selective code rings, to all signal {{boxes in the}} area. This method of operating was sometimes known as the Telephone Train Control System. If the Signalman required directions, he simply lifted the receiver {{and spoke to the}} Train Controller on the omnibus circuit. If the Train Controller wanted to issue instructions or receive train arrival and departure times, he selected the relevant signal box on his telephone, which rang the Control 'phone therein. There were two main problems with this system. Firstly, the Train Controllers could become overloaded with path requests from Signalmen, train recording and other duties. This led to delays for Signalmen waiting for their turn to speak on the omnibus circuit, making the role of the Train Controller somewhat self-defeating. Secondly, Signalmen were often {{in a better position to}} make train working decisions by virtue of their experience and by being on the spot, but were prevented from doing so by bureaucratic procedures. In silent admission of the deficiencies of this system, Signalmen were generally left to their own devices, especially in the event of a general disruption to train services, during which the train control system simply could not handle the demands placed upon it.|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{expansion}} in numbers of cloud service providers (CSPs) {{has resulted in}} the introduction of various brokering services and cloud marketplaces designed to help customers to assess and choose CSPs. The problem of evaluating marketplaces and also separate sub-offerings supplied by cloud service providers (CSPs) has become vitally important because cloud marketplaces can now incorporate sub-offerings from different CSPs into a combined package tailored for each customer. In this paper, we introduce a new concept which we refer to as a cloud <b>omnibus</b> <b>system</b> (COS) and which we define as a cloud marketing system evaluating whole cloud marketplaces, CSPs, brokers and separate service sub-offerings from CSPs (sometimes combined into packages tailored for customers). COS is based on trust and management of trust and is beyond the state-of-the-art in providing a formal trust measuring mechanism for customers by introducing three types of trust which we refer to as ‘direct’, ‘relative’ and ‘transparent’...|$|E
