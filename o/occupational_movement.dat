Method of protocol development This intervention was based on cognitive behavioural therapy principles and was shown feasible in a pilot study. In {{order to meet the}} specific needs of stroke patients (concerning both sensori-motor, cognitive, and behavioural problems), we incorporated motivational interviewing, grief resolution, and psycho-education. We emphasised for each session {{to take into account the}} cognitive deficits of the patients (i. e. be concrete, accessible, structured, specific, and repeat information). Moreover, we augmented the psychologist-administered therapy with the contribution of an <b>occupational</b> or <b>movement</b> therapist aimed at facilitating patients’ goal-setting and attainment.

30|$|While {{the skills}} {{approach}} of estimating transferability is more {{compatible with the}} principles of the human capital model, its applicability to labor market outcomes is conditional upon the development of appropriate weights across individual knowledge and skill categories (Lazear 2009; Geel et al. 2011). While two occupations may exhibit considerable commonality of occupational demands over a broad array of skills – such as media relations specialists and economics professors – this may be relatively unimportant compared to demonstrated proficiency within a specific knowledge or skill area that is most critical to vocational success and/or represents a barrier to occupational entry. Ormiston (2014) attempts to estimate these weights by multiplying the “level” and “importance” scores of each KSA component, but this approach produces largely arbitrary estimates that are complicated by low discriminant validity across O*NET categories (Harvey and Wilson 2010). This imperfection offers the potential for considerable refinement of the skills approach and the development of more exact skill weights; such an approach may incorporate some components of Shaw (1984) which, by its very design, is better at identifying barriers to <b>occupational</b> <b>movement</b> even if the method is silent about the reason for such a barrier to exist.|$|E

40|$|The {{central focus}} of this thesis is how {{professionals}} in Singapore negotiate occupational mobility in their career life-course. The research seeks to understand the factors that underpin and guide individual aspiration and motivations when making occupational moves within career trajectories. Occupational mobility is fast becoming the norm among the international skilled labour force, creating a {{need to understand how}} such flexibility can be used advantageously, at the national level, for workforce management. The approach taken in this study conceptualises the career landscape as a field, and analyses mobility at the political, social and individual levels. It examines the power that is enacted by government on its citizens and the reflexive meaning making of individuals participating in occupational mobility. The empirical work consists of interviews with ex-teachers and ex-engineers in Singapore. The thesis presents an analysis of their narratives and identifies generic skills acquired in pre-employment training and in employment as a key to understanding how professional individuals are negotiating occupational fields. Amongst the achievements of the research is the understanding of what happens when individuals move from one occupation to the next. The research attempts to humanise the 'human resource' and present, through individual narratives, the individual's perspective on the changing nature of work, the need to participate in boundaryless work contexts and their involvement in occupational mobility. The thesis further illustrates the complexities that surround mobile behaviours of workers within an Asian context, and presents ways of understanding the needs of such professional workers so that they can negotiate the contemporary advanced economy landscape more effectively. The resulting conceptual framework attempts to explain how mobile Asian professional workers negotiate occupational mobility within a context that is influenced by conservative Confucian ideologies that place nation before self, and community before family. The research further emphasises the role that state-initiated lifelong learning structures play in creating the mobile worker and explores how generic skills facilitate <b>occupational</b> <b>movements.</b> It discusses the importance of contextualised skill acquisition and practice for subsequent recontextualisation in a new occupation and also aligns current career discourses to the perceptions that these individuals have of their occupations. Finally, the role that lifelong learning is perceived to play when considering the need for career adaptability competences, the space for recontextualisation of skills and the ideologies that influence individual occupational mobility are presented. By looking at those who have participated in it themselves, this research explores how individuals engage in occupational mobility and explains how control can be maintained over people's personal aspirations in the grand occupational mobility scheme.

30|$|The idea of {{occupational}} skills transferability {{was first introduced}} by Shaw (1984). She defined the concept {{of occupational}} human capital as “individual investment in skills which relate to one particular occupation, and he/she {{would be able to}} transfer a certain amount of his/her occupation skills during the occupational switch depending on the ‘transferability’ between those two occupations” (pp. 320 – 321). More specifically, Shaw notes that the return to the stock of human capital from the former occupation is not completely foregone upon during an occupational switch. Instead, the return to one’s human capital stock depends on the degree of transferability of skills from one occupation to the next. In spite of Shaw’s findings and contributions, only a few recent studies, particularly on the job displacement, have started to focus on the importance of skills transferability. For instance, Ormiston (2006) developed an occupational skills transferability index and showed that there is a positive relationship between skills transferability and <b>occupational</b> <b>movement</b> as well as post-displacement earnings among blue-collar workers. 3 In particular, he found that displaced blue-collar workers are more likely to choose a new occupation with high skills transferability. Schönberg and Gathmann (2010) use the repeated cross-section German Qualification and Career Survey to estimate the transferability of three aggregate groups of skills (analytical, manual, and interactive) across 64 occupations in the German labor market. Their results show that workers are more likely to move to occupations with similar skill requirements, and more than 40  % of their wage growth {{can be attributed to the}} proportion of these portable skills. In addition, there is an increase in earnings losses for the displaced workers who moved to a distant occupation after a job displacement.|$|E

In the postindustrial era, however, women’s careers, characterized by the constant negotiation of multiple roles and more frequent job changes, have had implications on {{the changing nature of}} careers. The general purpose of this thesis is to increase knowledge about the process of career development of women. The focus is on two aspects: Life Career (characterized by multiple role constellations over the life course) and Occupational Career (characterized by different shapes of <b>occupational</b> <b>movement</b> over the life course). Three sets of questions addressed these two aspects of career: trajectory patterns, interrelationships, and antecedents and consequences. Career biographies covered ages 16 to 43. Antecedents reflecting individual agency (e. g., life role value, aspiration, and early experiences) were investigated. The impact of family context on occupational choice was also examined. Among the consequences examined were midlife work wellness and stress, health, and wellbeing. Results showed that (1) Career patterns were highly diverse, including nine distinct life career patterns and ten occupational career patterns. (2) Occupational and life careers were significantly related, indicating that the paid work career is embedded in the overall life role structure throughout the life course. (3) Individual agency factors predicted life career. Occupational career was related to life career more than family context. (4) Occupational career did matter in work wellbeing. In terms of stress, health, and wellbeing at midlife, there was little difference among life career patterns, but more significant differences among occupational career patterns.

40|$|BACKGROUND and OBJECTIVES: Low-back {{overexertion}} injuries {{represent a}} large proportion of fireground “strains, sprains and muscular pains” and are a leading cause of disability and early retirement in firefighters. Given the inherently hazardous and unpredictable nature of many fireground activities, it is often infeasible to implement “task-focused” ergonomic controls and there are limited options to accommodate injured firefighters. Accordingly, effective and practical “worker-focused” injury prevention approaches are needed. Toward this end, four studies were conducted to address the following global thesis objectives: 1) Examine the possible role that firefighters’ personal movement strategies could have on their occupational low-back loading demands and injury potential; and 2) Compare the effects of two different exercise approaches on firefighters’ occupational low-back loading demands and injury potential. STUDY 1 : Low-Back Loading Demands during Simulated Firefighting Tasks – Inter-Subject Variation and the Impact of Fatigue and Gender. Background: Non-modifiable fireground duties are considered hazardous for low-back health, but personal movement strategies could modulate low-back loading demands and injury potential. Study objectives were to quantify low-back loading demands during simulated firefighting tasks and to examine the impact of fatigue and gender on the peak loading response. Methods: Ten men and 10 women performed a battery of laboratory-simulated firefighting tasks before and following repeated bouts of a fatiguing stair-climbing protocol. An EMG-assisted three-dimensional dynamic biomechanical model was used to compute peak L 4 /L 5 joint forces during task performance. Results: Peak low-back loading demands varied considerably between subjects and tasks, but 70 % of all loading variables examined were of greater magnitudes in male subjects and 40 % of all loading variables were of lower magnitudes in both males and females after stair-climbing. Some inter-subject variation in low-back loading was attributed to body size differences, but between- and within-subject differences in movement strategies also contributed to low-back loading variability between subjects and over time. Conclusions: Results {{of this study suggest that}} characteristics of individuals, tasks performed, and physical fatigue may influence peak low-back loading demands and injury potential in firefighters. Despite considerable inter-subject variation in the internal low-back loading response to fixed external task and environmental constraints, opportunities to attenuate low-back loading demands through movement behaviour adaptations alone may be limited to only a subset of fireground activities. STUDY 2 : Ankle Immobilization alters Lifting Kinematics and Kinetics – Occupational Low-Back Loading Demands and Potential for Injury. Background: Firefighters with lingering lower extremity functional impairments could be forced to move in ways that increase their potential for sustaining occupational low-back lifting injuries. The study objective was to examine the impact of unilateral ankle immobilization on lifting kinematics and kinetics. Methods: With and without their right ankle immobilized, 10 male volunteers performed laboratory-simulated occupational lifting tasks. Together with force platform data, three-dimensional kinematics of the lumbar spine, pelvis, and lower extremities were collected, and a three-dimensional dynamic biomechanical model was used to calculate peak low-back compression and shear loading demands. Results: In comparison to the unaffected conditions, ankle immobilization resulted in less knee (p-values between 0. 0004 and 0. 0697) and greater lumbar spine (p-values between 0. 0006 and 0. 3491) sagittal motion when lifting. Associated with this compensatory movement strategy were greater L 4 /L 5 anterior/posterior reaction shear forces (p-values between 0. 0009 and 0. 2450). However, in a few cases where individual compensatory movement strategies differed from the “group” response (i. e., subjects increased their sagittal knee and hip motion on the affected side), peak L 4 /L 5 joint compressive loads increased while the peak L 4 /L 5 anterior-posterior shear did not change. Conclusions: Distal lower extremity joint dysfunction can alter the way in which individuals move and load their low-backs when lifting. The specific ways in which individuals compensate for personal movement constraints could alter the potential site and mechanism of occupational low-back injury. STUDY 3 : FMS™ Scores and Occupational Low-Back Loading Demands – Whole-Body Movement Screening as an Ergonomic Tool? Background: Results of Study 1 suggested that a whole-body movement screen could be used to identify personal characteristics that constrain movement behaviour in ways that impact occupational low-back loading demands and injury potential. The purpose of this study was to examine if Functional Movement Screen™ (FMS) scores could be used to project the low-back loading response to lifting. Methods: Sagittally symmetric and asymmetric laboratory-based lifting tasks were performed by 15 firefighters who scored greater than 14 on the FMS (high-scorers) and 15 size-matched low-scorers (FMS < 14). A three-dimensional dynamic biomechanical model was used to calculate low-back loading demands, and lumbar spine posture was recorded when peak low-back compression was imposed. Results: Regardless of the task performed, there were no differences in peak L 4 /L 5 joint compression (p ≥ 0. 4157), anterior/posterior reaction shear (p ≥ 0. 5645), or medial/lateral reaction shear (p ≥ 0. 2581) loading demands between high- and low-scorers. At the instant when peak compression force was detected, lumbar spine deviation was not different between high- and low-scorers about the lateral bend (p ≥ 0. 4215), axial twist (p ≥ 0. 2734), or flexion/extension (p ≥ 0. 1354) axes. Conclusions: Using the previously established musculoskeletal injury prediction threshold value of 14, the composite FMS score did not project the low-back loading response to lifting. Future attempts to modify or reinterpret FMS scoring are warranted given that several previous studies have revealed links between composite FMS scores and musculoskeletal complaints. STUDY 4 : Movement- vs. Fitness-Centric Exercise – Firefighter Fitness, Whole-Body Movement Qualities, and Occupational Low-Back Loading Outcomes. Background: The impact of exercise on firefighter job performance and cardiorespiratory fitness has been studied extensively, but its effect on musculoskeletal loading remains less understood. The aim of this study was to compare various physical fitness, general movement quality, and low-back loading outcomes between groups of firefighters who completed fitness- or movement-centric exercise. Methods: Fifty-four firefighters participated and were assigned to a control (CON), fitness-centric exercise (FIT), or movement-centric exercise (MOV) group. Before and after 12 weeks of exercise, subjects performed a physical fitness test battery, the Functional Movement Screen™ (FMS), and laboratory-simulated firefighting tasks during which low-back loading demands were quantified. Results: FIT and MOV subjects exhibited statistically significant improvements in nearly all measures of physical fitness (i. e., body composition, cardiorespiratory capacity, muscular strength, power, endurance, and flexibility), but FMS scores and occupational low-back loading demands were not impacted in a consistent way across individuals. Conclusions: Improving physical fitness can enhance job performance and prevent cardiac events in firefighters, but it was not clear that 12 weeks of exercise would alter their occupational low-back loading demands. Given variability in individual responses, the short study duration, and limited number and nature of tasks examined, more research incorporating alternative biomechanical and statistical analyses is needed to better understand how individuals adapt to chronic exercise and what impact these adaptations have on <b>occupational</b> <b>movement</b> behaviours, low-back loading demands, and low-back loading capacity. SUMMARY and CONCLUSIONS: Results confirmed that fireground activities are potentially hazardous for low-back health, as simulated occupational low-back loading demands routinely exceeded recommended exposure limits in the studies performed. However, results also indicated that personal movement strategies – possibly influenced by body size, preference, gender, physical fatigue, or distal lower extremity joint dysfunction – could alter occupational low-back loading demands and injury potential. It could not be concluded that occupational low-back loading demands and injury potential would be consistently affected by short-term improvements in physical fitness, nor could the low-back loading response to lifting be projected by scoring above or below 14 on the Functional Movement Screen™. Future research is warranted to examine the low-back loading demands associated with performing non-fireground duties, as opportunities may exist to implement ergonomic strategies to control cumulative low-back loading exposures. Particular attention should be paid to the exercise and training practices of firefighters, as musculoskeletal injuries sustained during these activities are potentially avoidable and could reduce the capacity of the musculoskeletal system to withstand demands imposed during non-modifiable fireground operations...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of individually tailored cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for reducing depressive symptoms with or without anxiety poststroke. DESIGN: Multicenter, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Ambulatory rehabilitation setting. PARTICIPANTS: Patients who had a Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression subscale (HADS-D) score > 7 at least 3 months poststroke (N= 61). INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly allocated to either augmented CBT or computerized cognitive training (CCT). The CBT intervention was based on the principles of recognizing, registering, and altering negative thoughts and cognitions. CBT was augmented with goal-directed real-life activity training given by an <b>occupational</b> or <b>movement</b> therapist. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HADS-D was the primary outcome, and measures of participation and quality of life were secondary outcomes. Outcome measurements were performed at baseline, immediately posttreatment, and at 4 - and 8 -month follow-up. Analysis was performed with linear mixed models using group (CBT vs CCT) as the between-subjects factor and time (4 assessments) as the within-subjects factor. RESULTS: Mixed model analyses showed a significant and persistent time effect for HADS-D (mean difference, - 4. 6; 95 % confidence interval, - 5. 7 to - 3. 6; P<. 001) and for participation and quality of life in both groups.

An inexpensive, attractive, and versatile solution for handwriting training and rehabilitation was developed using a mechanical linkage connected to the Novint Falcon haptic device. Several phases of design resulted in a mechanical linkage which was conceptualized and manufactured...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of {{inflation}} on wage changes made by firms in a unique thirty-seven-year panel of occupations and employers drawn from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Community Salary Survey (CSS). Our analysis first identifies two relative prices embedded in wage changes and, second, draws inferences about {{the costs and benefits}} of inflation from the adjustments in these relative prices. Typically, firms manage employer-wide wage adjustments (controlling for occupational wage changes) separately from their interoccupational wage changes (controlling for employer wage hikes). Consistent with this observation, we identify large independent employer and occupational components of wage changes in the CSS. Although there is no a priori reason why these adjustments should be altered by inflation (when the average change is subtracted out), we find that variation in both of these terms rises as inflation grows. Guided by institutional wage-setting procedures, we view employers' mean wage hikes as subject to intra-market variations in the speed of adjustment to inflation and forecasting errors. In contrast, we argue that <b>occupational</b> wage <b>movements</b> include a higher concentration of inter-market relative price adjustments. This simple dichotomy, whose robustness we attempt to test, yields two policy-oriented results. First, higher inflation and labor productivity appear to increase the rate of occupational wage adjustments ("grease"), although these potential benefits taper off after inflation rises to about 4 percent (assuming 1. 5 percent average growth of labor productivity.) Second, potentially inefficient variations in employer wage adjustments ("sand") continue to mount until inflation reaches rates of 7 to 10 percent (again assuming productivity growth of 1. 5 percent). Inflation (Finance); Labor productivity; Labor market; Wages...|$|R
40|$|Background Post-Stroke Depression with {{or without}} Anxiety (PSDA) is a common {{disorder}} in the chronic phase of stroke. Neuropsychiatric problems, such as PSDA, {{have a negative impact}} on social reintegration and quality of life. Currently, there is no evidence-based treatment available for reducing PSDA symptoms. In the recent literature on depression in the general population it has been shown that depression complaints can diminish by cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). In the current study, the effectiveness of augmented, activation-based and individually tailored CBT on the reduction of depression and anxiety will be investigated in patients with PSDA. Additionally, the effects on various secondary outcome measures, such as quality of life, goal attainment and societal participation will be evaluated. This study is embedded in a consortium of 4 interrelated studies on quality of life after stroke (Restore 4 Stroke). Methods/design A multi-centre, assessor-blind, randomized controlled trial is conducted. A sample of 106 PSDA patients, as assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS depression subscale > 7), will be recruited and randomly allocated to either an experimental or a control group. The experimental intervention consists of an augmented CBT intervention. The intervention is based on CBT principles of recognizing, registering, and altering negative thoughts and cognitions so that mood, and emotional symptoms are improved. CBT is augmented with direct in-vivo activation offered by <b>occupational</b> or <b>movement</b> therapists. Patients in the control group will receive a computerized cognitive training intervention. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, immediately post intervention, and at 6 and 12 [*]months follow up. Discussion This study is the first randomized clinical trial that evaluates the (maintenance of) effects of augmented CBT on post-stroke depression {{with or without}} anxiety symptoms. Together with three other projects, the Restore 4 Stroke PSDA trial will provide novel information about the (treatment of) emotional problems and quality of life after stroke...|$|R

Using a specially designed Gallup survey of a nationally representative sample of Americans, we provide an analysis of the influence of this form of occupational regulation. We find that 29 percent of the workforce is required to hold a license, which is a higher percentage than that found in other studies that rely on state-level occupational licensing data or single states. Workers who have higher levels of education are more likely to work in jobs that require a license. Union workers and government employees {{are more likely to have}} a license requirement than are nonunion or private sector employees. Our multivariate estimates suggest that licensing has about the same quantitative impact on wages as do unions [...] that is about 15 percent, but unlike unions, licensing does not One of the fastest growing, yet least understood, institutions in the U.

40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Many {{authors in}} their studies, report that {{repetitive}} activities are effective {{causes of the}} emergence of <b>occupational</b> diseases. Repetitive <b>movements</b> can often bring risk of injury, as the number of movements increases and / or the cycle time decreases Objectives: To evaluate the reliability of the REE-ARMS tool compared with the OCRA tool for ergonomic risk analysis. Materials and Methods: The IVRE-ARMS tool was created based on the following existing tools: Ochre Index, Rula, Reba, Moore and Garg and Tor-Tom, in addition to ISO 31000, ISO 11226 and ISO 11228 - 3. The research was given by a cross-sectional study, which analyzed 134 jobs, refrigerated poultry activities (55 posts) and pigs (60 posts) and banking activities (19 posts), all were applied the OCRA and IVRE- tools ARMS. Results: The Kendall tau test showed that there is a high statistical correlation between the OCRA and IVRE-ARMS tools, showing the reliability of the new tool. Conclusion: The IVRE-ARMS tool has been validated scientifically compared with the OCRA. This new tool provides the evaluator have multiple analysis of data, and the biomechanical also analyzed by OCRA, analyzes the organizational part, cognitive and biomechanics, stratifies the upper limb in shoulder, elbow and wrist. Thus this new tool enriches the ergonomic analysis and generating quantitative instrumentation to explore the most needed areas for improvement...|$|R
