40|$|Current {{hypertension}} guidelines recommend {{using two}} antihypertensive agents when blood pressure (BP) control is not achieved with one single agent. Objective: This {{study was designed}} to assess the antihypertensive benefit of the <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12. 5 mg combination versus <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg monotherapy in patients with moderate to severe hypertension. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, up-titration, multicentre, multinational, phase III study. Following a 2 -week single-blind placebo run-in phase, 846 hypertensive patients with mean seated systolic BP (SeSBP) of 160200 mmHg and mean seated diastolic BP (SeDBP) of 100120 mmHg were randomized (1 : 2 ratio) to receive double-blind treatment with <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg or <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg/HCTZ 12. 5 mg for 8 weeks (phase A). At week 8, patients not reaching BP goal (< 140 / 90 mmHg; < 130 / 80 mmHg in patients with diabetes mellitus) were up-titrated from <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg to <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg/HCTZ 12. 5 mg or from <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg/HCTZ 12. 5 mg to <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg/HCTZ 25 mg for an additional 8 weeks (phase B). Patients on goal continued their initial treatment. The primary efficacy parameter was the change in mean SeDBP during phase A. Results: <b>Olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg/HCTZ 12. 5 mg reduced mean SeDBP significantly more (- 18. 9 mmHg) than <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg (- 15. 8 mmHg) after 8 weeks of double-blind treatment (difference: - 3. 1 mmHg, p < 0. 0001). <b>Olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg/HCTZ 12. 5 mg also reduced mean SeSBP significantly more than <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg (- 5. 4 mmHg, p < 0. 0001). As a result, BP goal rates at week 8 were significantly higher with <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg/HCTZ 12. 5 mg than with <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg (58. 5 % vs 44. 3 %; odds ratio 1. 88; 95 % CI 1. 32, 2. 54). During phase B, mean BP reductions were greater in patients up-titrated from <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg to <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg/HCTZ 12. 5 mg than in those continuing on <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg (SeDBP: 9. 3 mmHg vs 0. 5 mmHg; SeSBP: 12. 4 mmHg vs 0. 5 mmHg). Similarly, mean BP reductions were greater in patients up-titrated from <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg/HCTZ 12. 5 mg to <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg/HCTZ 25 mg than in those continuing on <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg/HCTZ 12. 5 mg (SeDBP: 8. 0 mmHg vs 0. 3 mmHg; SeSBP: 12. 1 mmHg vs 0. 4 mmHg). In patients not on goal at week 8, addition of HCTZ 12. 5 mg to <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg or up-titration from <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg/HCTZ 12. 5 mg to <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg/HCTZ 25 mg brought additional patients to goal at week 16 (38. 8 % vs 36. 9 %). All treatments were well tolerated. Conclusion: The <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg/HCTZ 12. 5 mg combination is superior to <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg monotherapy in reducing SeDBP and SeSBP and increasing BP goal rates after 8 weeks.

40|$|Hypertension is {{the leading}} cause of stroke, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. One of the key {{regulators}} of blood pressure is the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS). <b>Olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil,</b> an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), counteracts some of the primary effects of the RAAS by selectively and irreversibly binding to the type 1 angiotensin II receptor (AT 1 -R). The pharmacokinetic profile of this ARB allows for the convenience of one a day dosing. The pharmacodynamic profile of olmesartan is favorable because it is neither metabolized by, induces, nor inhibits the CYP 450 isozyme system. The metabolism of the prodrug to the active form occurs in the gut by the enzyme arylesterase. No further metabolism and a lack of interaction with the CYP 450 isozyme system leads to very few drug interactions with <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil.</b> Numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil.</b> Studies have been conducted to compare <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> to other angiotensin receptor blockers. The efficacy of <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> has been compared to other classes of antihypertensive agents.

40|$|Whether {{a higher}} dose of a long-acting {{angiotensin}} II receptor blocker (ARB) can provide as much blockade of the renin-angiotensin system over a 24 -hour period as {{the combination of}} an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a lower dose of ARB has not been formally demonstrated so far. In this randomized double-blind study we investigated renin-angiotensin system blockade obtained with 3 doses of <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> (20, 40, and 80 mg every day) in 30 normal subjects and compared it with that obtained with lisinopril alone (20 mg every day) or combined with <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> (20 or 40 mg). Each subject received 2 dose regimens for 1 week according to a crossover design with a 1 -week washout period between doses. The primary endpoint was the degree of blockade of the systolic blood pressure response to angiotensin I 24 hours after the last dose after 1 week of administration. At trough, the systolic blood pressure response to exogenous angiotensin I was 58 % +/- 19 % with 20 mg lisinopril (mean +/- SD), 58 % +/- 11 % with 20 mg <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil,</b> 62 % +/- 16 % with 40 mg <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil,</b> and 76 % +/- 12 % with the highest dose of <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> (80 mg) (P =. 016 versus 20 mg lisinopril and P =. 0015 versus 20 mg <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil).</b> With the combinations, blockade was 80 % +/- 22 % with 20 mg lisinopril plus 20 mg <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> and 83 % +/- 9 % with 20 mg lisinopril plus 40 mg <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> (P =. 3 versus 80 mg <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> alone). These data demonstrate that a higher dose of the long-acting ARB <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> can produce an almost complete 24 -hour blockade of the blood pressure response to exogenous angiotensin in normal subjects.

40|$|Background and objective: Achieving target BP is {{important}} to control the increased cardiovascular risk associated with uncontrolled hypertension. However, failure to respond to therapy is common with all classes of antihypertensive agents. Angiotensin H type I receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) possess many of the positive features of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, with fewer adverse effects. However, many patients fail to respond adequately to low-dose monotherapy. This study examined whether <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> dose titration and olmesartan medoxomil/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy were therapeutically equivalent in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension who had shown an inadequate response to low-dose <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> monotherapy. Methods: This was a prospective, parallel group, partially randomised, double-blind study set in 463 centres in nine European countries. 2306 male and female adult patients aged 18 - 75 years with mild to moderate essential hypertension (sitting diastolic BP [DBP] >= 90 mm Hg and = 90 mm Hg) were randomised to receive <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> monotherapy (40 mg once daily, n = 302) or <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> (20 mg once daily) / hydrochlorothiazide (12. 5 mg once daily) combination therapy (n = 325) for 4 weeks. The main outcome measure was change in mean sitting DBP during randomised treatment. Results: After 8 weeks of open-label treatment with <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 20 mg/day, 76 % of patients showed a DBP response (sitting DBP = 10 mm Hg). During the randomised phase of the study, both treatments were associated with further improvements in sitting SBP/DBP: a reduction of 5. 3 / 5. 1 mm Hg with <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg/day, and a reduction of 10. 8 / 7. 9 mm Hg with olmesartan medoxomil/thydrochlorothiazide combination therapy. Final mean BPs of 145. 3 / 90. 9 mm Hg (<b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 40 mg/day) and 140. 7 / 88. 7 mm Hg (<b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 20 mg + hydrochlorothiazide) were achieved, compared with a mean BP of 160. 8 / 100. 5 mm Hg at baseline. The two treatments were not therapeutically equivalent. Sitting DBP showed a response and was normalised (< 90 mm Hg) in 62 % and 47 % of <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> monotherapy patients, respectively. In the combination therapy group, these endpoints were achieved by 71 % (response) and 59 % (normalisation) of patients.

Methods: We performed a analysis of pooled data from two randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre studies. After a 2 -week placebo wash-out period, 1453 mild to moderate hypertensive subjects were randomized to a 12 -week treatment with <b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> 10 mg day or ramipril 2. 5 mg/day. After 2 and 6 weeks, doses were increased up to a maximum of 40 mg/day (<b>olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil)</b> and 10 mg/day (ramipril) in non-normalized subjects (office systolic blood pressure [SBP] â¥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] â¥ 90 mmHg in non-diabetic subjects and office SBP â¥ 130 mmHg or DBP â¥ 80 mmHg in diabetic patients).

40|$|Carlos FerrarioHypertension and Vascular Disease Center, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USAAbstract: Endothelial {{dysfunction}} is {{the common}} link between cardiovascular disease risk factors and the earliest event in the cascade of incidents that results in target organ damage. Angiotensin II, the terminal pressor effector arm of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases blood pressure (BP) by vasoconstriction and sodium and fluid retention, and has a pro-oxidative action that induces endothelial dysfunction and contributes to vascular remodeling. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce BP and morbidity and mortality in patients&nbsp;with hypertension, ventricular hypertrophy, diabetes mellitus, and renal disease. <b>Olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil</b> is a long-acting, well-tolerated, effective ARB that prevents or reverses endothelial dysfunction in animal models of atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, nephropathy, and retinopathy. <b>Olmesartan</b> <b>medoxomil,</b> a prodrug of olmesartan approved {{for the treatment of}} hypertension, has been shown to ameliorate endothelial dysfunction in patients with hypertension or diabetes.
