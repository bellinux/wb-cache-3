25|$|In 2012, the Palestinian Authority {{applied for}} {{admission}} as a United Nations non-member state, which requires only a {{vote by the}} United Nations General Assembly.

25|$|The {{pictograms}} or glyphs <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>writing</b> {{system were}} more formal and rigid than images found on murals and other art forms {{as they were}} considered mostly symbolic, representing formulas related to astronomical events, genealogy and historic events. Most surviving pre-Hispanic codices come from the late Mesoamerican period and early colonial period, as more of these escaped destruction over history. For this reason, more {{is known about the}} Aztec Empire than the Mayan cultures. Important Aztec codices include the Borgia Group of mainly religious works, some of which probably pre-date the conquest, the Codex Borbonicus, Codex Mendoza, and the late Florentine Codex, which is in a European style but executed by Mexican artists, probably drawing on earlier material that is now lost.|$|E

500|$|Goldwater grew libertarian as {{he reached}} the end of his career, and chose to retire from the Senate in 1987. He was succeeded by John McCain, who praised his {{predecessor}} as the man who [...] "transformed the Republican Party from an Eastern elitist organization to the breeding ground for the election of Ronald Reagan." [...] Goldwater strongly supported the 1980 presidential campaign of Reagan, who had become the face of the conservative movement after his Time for Choosing speech. Reagan reflected many of the principles of Goldwater's earlier run in his campaign. Washington Post columnist George Will took note <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>writing,</b> [...] "We...who voted for him in 1964 believe he won, it just took 16 years to count the votes." ...|$|E
500|$|Historically {{linked to}} the {{discovery}} and first recorded appearance of Hale–Bopp is Heaven's Gate.

Applewhite and 38 followers poisoned themselves over three days in March 1997 in the belief this {{would allow them to}} pass through [...] "Heaven's Gate" [...] and achieve [...] "the Evolutionary Level Above Human." [...] The rationale for taking their lives was (and is, as <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>writing)</b> clearly detailed on the group's website which is maintained by surviving cult members.|$|E

500|$|The {{most common}} {{criticism}} of the game was its numerous technical glitches. Adam Diamond of Isthmus was {{not happy with the}} pathfinding, writing, [...] "I often found myself traveling solo through a dungeon, my companions spread out far behind me, leaving me vulnerable to attack. What's the point of having henchmen if they're not there to protect you?". [...] Some reviews compared Neverwinter Nights 2 to , a previous Obsidian game that had received similar complaints. The bugs were described as disruptive to gameplay and [...] "downright infuriating", and one reviewer encountered a [...] "showstopper bug" [...] in the initial retail version that prevented him from playing the game past a certain point. The bugs were said to negatively affect NPC AI, camera operation, and pathfinding. One review stated [...] "The launch–to–load time is fairly long so be prepared to wonder if the game has crashed or is loading." [...] Obsidian was quick to release fixes for several bugs, but later reviews still described the glitches as a serious problem. 1UP.com's review, written two weeks after the game's release, stated [...] "But the sad truth is that NWN2 shipped in a pretty messy state, and even after a couple patches (as <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>writing),</b> the biggest problems remain." ...|$|E
