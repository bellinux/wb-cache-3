5|$|On 7 June, the {{battleship}} received {{word that the}} Ranger battalion at Pointe Du Hoc was still isolated {{from the rest of}} the invasion force with low ammunition and mounting casualties; in response, Texas obtained and filled two LCVPs with provisions and ammunition for the Rangers. Upon their return, the LCVPs brought thirty-five wounded Rangers to Texas for treatment of which one died <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>table.</b> Along with the Rangers, a deceased Coast Guard sailor and twenty-seven prisoners (twenty Germans, four Italians, and three French) were brought to the ship. The prisoners were fed, segregated, and not formally interrogated aboard Texas, due to the ship bombarding targets or standing by to bombard, before being loaded aboard an LST for transfer to England. Later in the day, her main battery rained shells on the enemy-held towns of Formigny and Trévières to break up German troop concentrations. That evening, she bombarded a German mortar battery that had been shelling the beach. Not long after midnight, German planes attacked the ships offshore, and one of them swooped in low on Texass starboard quarter. Her anti-aircraft batteries opened up immediately but failed to hit the intruder. On the morning of 8 June, her guns fired on Isigny, then on a shore battery, and finally on Trévières once more.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Registration is a {{universal}} problem which must be addressed in almost all computer-assisted or image -guided surgical systems. It is equally important in orthopaedics, neurosurgery, spine surgery, cranio-facial surgery, or any speciality in which computer-assisted surgical techniques are employed. The need for intra-operative registration arises {{due to the fact}} that there is an unknown spatial relationship between the pre-operative data (i. e., medical images, surgical plans) and <b>the</b> physical patient <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> room <b>table.</b> In other words, while it may be possible to visualize a portion of the patient's anatomy (e. g., a pelvis) within the pre-operative medical images, and also to visualize the same anatomy using intra-operative sensor data (e. g., ultrasound, X-Rays, or direct viewing), the precise spatial correspondence between these two pelvis representations is unknown.

40|$|Background and Objectives: In {{the last}} few years many new {{instruments}} and devices have been developed and introduced into <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> room (OR). A debate has been ongoing about the optimal ergonomic posture for <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> staff. From practical experience, we have learned that <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>tables</b> cannot be adjusted adequately to allow surgeons of different stature to maintain a comfortable posture. The goal {{of this study was to}} establish the most ergonomic table height for the particular physique of the surgeon and the different types of laparoscopic instrument handles that he or she uses. Methods: In a simulated model, two probands of different stature (50 th {BS 50 } and 95 th {BS 95 } percentile) used laparoscopic instruments with four different handle designs (shank, pistol, axial, and rod). The instruments were inserted into a board in three different angles ({IA} = 20 °, 30 °, 40 °). Additionally the elbow angles (EA) of the volunteers were fixed to either 90 ° or 120 °. For every variable (size of surgeon and his or her elbow angle, design of handle, insertion angle of the instrument) the height of the board, as a parameter for the level of the abdominal wall of a patient with pneumoperitioneum, was measured from the floor. Results: All parameters had an effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> optimal <b>operating</b> <b>table</b> height. <b>The</b> lowest required <b>operating</b> <b>table</b> level was 30 cm, the highest was 60. 5 cm.

40|$|A 63 -year-old man who {{had been}} {{complaining}} for 2 weeks of “aching ” in his lower abdomen was referred by his family physician to the radiology department of a hospital for CT of the abdomen and pelvis. Two days after the CT examination, the physician telephoned a secretary in the radiology department, stating that he had not received a report of the CT. The secretary replied that she would investigate the matter and forward a report to him. Four days later, a nurse at the physician’s office again telephoned the radiology department to complain that a report of the CT examination still had not been received. There is no evidence that anyone in the radiology department followed up on these telephone calls. Eight days after the CT examination, the patient experienced acute onset of excruciating pain in the lower abdomen and back. The patient was rushed to the emergency department of the hospital, where he was found to be profoundly hypotensive and tachycardic.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} a commercially available acetabular positioning device, we performed a prospective evaluation of 40 consecutive patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty. All surgery was performed by the same surgeon, in <b>the</b> same <b>operating</b> room, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same <b>operating</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> acetabular positioning device was designed to place the component in 45 ° of abduction. At 6  weeks, all radiographs were evaluated by 3 investigators not involved with the surgery. Each radiograph was evaluated by each reviewer on 3 separate occasions, blinded {{to the findings of}} the other reviewer to assess interobserver and intraobserver variability. The mean cup abduction angle was 42. 1 °, with a range from 23 ° to 57 ° (SD 8. 3 °). Intraobserver and interobserver variability were 0. 2 and 0. 3 °, respectively. The findings of this study demonstrate a wide variability in acetabular cup placement in primary total hip arthroplasty. We believe this is due to movement of the pelvis, which may occur during preparation, draping, and retracting during surgery. We feel surgeons should not rely solely on positioning devices when implanting the acetabular component in total hip arthroplasty. Identification of bone landmarks and determination of superolateral implant coverage noted on preoperative templating is advocated to improve the precision of component position...|$|R
25|$|Patients with {{thalassemia}} major {{are more}} inclined to have a splenectomy. The medical cases of splenectomies have been declining in recent years due to decreased prevalence of hypersplenism in adequately transfused patients. Patients with hypersplenism are inclined to have a lower amount of healthy blood cells in their body than normal and reveal symptoms of anemia. Iron rich patients need a splenectomy to reduce the probability of an iron overload. The different surgical techniques are the open and laparoscopic method. The laparoscopic method requires longer operating time but a shorter recovery period with no surgical scar. If it is unnecessary to remove the entire spleen a partial splenectomy may occur; this method preserves some of the immune function while reducing the probability of hypersplenism. Surgeons who chose Laparoscopic splenectomy must administer an appropriate immunization at least two weeks before the surgery. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>table</b> the patient must be placed at a 30˚ to 40˚ position with his or her left arm elevated above the head to properly make the incision. The camera is inserted along with four other trocars: one placed in the left subcostal area, one inserted at the midpoint between the first and third, one 4cm right of the midline, and the fourth positioned on the midline to retract the spleen. Removing the spleen, an organ in under a person’s rib cage on the upper left side of its abdominal, allows the body to regulate the correct amount of healthy cells in the body.|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} an online system for creating patient specific heart models for Magnetocardiographic measurements (MCG). The heart model is created from fluoroscopy images and ultrasound measurements. Because the images are taken <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same <b>operating</b> <b>table</b> as MCG,the patient in not moved between the measurements. The objective {{is to create a}} 3 D heart model corresponding to the patient's geometry during the MCG session. The epicardium is segmented manually from two orthogonal digital fluoroscopy images. Then an a priori 3 D model is deformed to these outlines. The model is a mean generated from segmented Magnetic Resonance (MR) datasets taken from 16 subjects. The model includes the epicardium, the ventricles and the atria. Thereafter, several measurements are defined from ultrasound images and the model is further refined to match these measurements by deforming it locally. Finally,the model is attached to the MCG coordinate system with a grid of markers that are visible in the fluoroscopy images. The system is capable of producing relatively accurate heart models {{in a matter of minutes}} on a common PC. In our approach, expensive and time-consuming MR imaging is not required. In an ongoing clinical validation the best 3 D accuracy achievable by a skilled cardiologist using our online model is compared using MR images...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients {{undergoing}} cardiovascular surgery are at {{high risk}} for sores because of impaired perfusion, <b>the</b> time spent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> room <b>table,</b> and restricted mobility in the immediate postoperative period. OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for sores. METHODS: In a 900 -bed teaching hospital, 163 patients who underwent cardiovascular interventions were enrolled. Risk measurement included skin assessment, Braden and Norton scales, physic and biologic data and specific risk factors. The development of the most severe stages of pressure sores was followed (Stages II and III). RESULTS: Forty-eight (29. 5 %) patients totalized 75 pressure sores. In univariate analyses, Norton and Braden scores, hemoglobin concentration, presence of ulcers at admission, use of antihypertensive drugs, systemic use of corticosteroids, nosocomial infection, re-intervention and readmission in intensive care units were associated with sores. In a logistic regression model, hemoglobin concentration at admission (p= 0. 0007), postoperative Braden score (p= 0. 0002), and postoperative steroid therapy (p= 0. 020) were the only predictors of sores. Total length of stay was 6 days higher (p= 0. 03) for patients with pressure sores. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of risks is recommended during the entire stay. Identification of patients at risk is required to provide preventive resources appropriately, which can lessen the incidence of pressure sores and reduce patient discomfort, length and costs of hospital stay...|$|R

The patients were brought to the day surgery area following appropriate fasting and administered one of the medications diluted in a dose of 0. 1 mL/kg normal saline while sitting in a nurse's arms. Cardiorespiratory monitors were applied when tolerated, and the child was placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> room <b>table.</b> Each child was injected locally with up to one dental cartridge of 2 % lidocaine with 1 : 100, 000 epinephrine before dental extractions. A sedation score was recorded using a scale where 1 = hysterical/untreatable, 5 = ideal sedation, and 10 = obtunded and desaturated, requiring airway management assistance. Midazolam administration resulted in acceptable sedation (mean score: 4) with no desaturations below 90 % as measured by pulse oximetry and a mean recovery room observation time of only 3 +/- 2 min (+/- SD). Ketamine also had a mean sedation score of 4 and a short recovery period (7 +/- 7 min); however, two children experienced brief desaturations. Sufentanil at 1. 5 micrograms/kg was noted to produce much more heavily sedated children (mean score 7), with a high incidence of significant oximetry desaturation (80 %) and prolonged recovery room duration (58 +/- 40 min).
