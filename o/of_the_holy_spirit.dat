5|$|Symeon's {{other main}} {{emphasis}} {{is the power}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> to transform, and the profound mystical union with God that is {{the end result of}} a holy life. Symeon referred to this as the Baptism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit,</b> compared to the more ritualistic Baptism of water. Symeon believed that Christianity had descended into formulae and church ritual, which for many people replaced the earlier emphasis on actual and direct experience of God. The Discourses express Symeon's strong conviction that the life of a Christian must be much more than mere observance of rules, and must include personal experience of the presence of the living Christ. Symeon describes his own conversion and mystical experience of the divine light.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{adoption}} of the article of faith on the baptism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> in 1908, the Pentecostal Holiness Church has taught the following beliefs as their five cardinal doctrines: justification by faith, entire sanctification, the baptism in the Holy Spirit evidenced by speaking in tongues, Christ's atonement (including divine healing), and the premillennial second coming of Christ.|$|E

5|$|In 1912 {{he built}} two pulpits {{for the church}} of Santa Maria in Blanes: the pulpit on the Gospel side had a {{hexagonal}} base, decorated with the dove <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> and the names in Latin of the four evangelists and the seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit; the pulpit of the Epistle side had {{the names of the}} apostles who wrote epistles (Saint Peter, Saint Paul, Saint John the Evangelist, Saint Judas Thadeus and Saint James the Great), with the three theological virtues and the flames of Pentecost. These pulpits were burned in July 1936.|$|E
5|$|In Christian theology, {{the work}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> under the Old Covenant {{is viewed as}} less {{extensive}} than that under the New Covenant inaugurated {{on the day of}} Pentecost. The Spirit was restricted to certain chosen individuals, such as high priests and prophets. Often termed the “spirit of prophecy” in rabbinic writings, the Holy Spirit was closely associated with prophecy and divine inspiration. It was anticipated that in the future messianic age God would pour out his spirit upon all of Israel, which would become a nation of prophets.|$|E

5|$|Later in Acts, Peter preached {{the gospel}} to the {{household}} of Cornelius the Centurion, a gentile. While he preached, the Holy Spirit {{fell on the}} gentiles, {{and they began to}} speak in tongues. The Jewish believers with Peter were amazed, and the household was water baptized. While the apostle Paul was in Ephesus, he found disciples there and discovered {{that they did not know}} of the existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> and had only received John the Baptist’s baptism. After baptizing them in Jesus’ name, Paul laid his hands on them, and they began to speak in tongues and prophesy.|$|E

5|$|The cantata text {{does not}} tell a story but {{reflects}} different aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit,</b> celebrated on Pentecost. It begins with general praise, then concentrates on one line from the Gospel, addresses the Holy Trinity, refers to the Spirit that {{was present at the}} Creation, shows a dialogue between the Soul and the Spirit, and concludes with a stanza from Nicolai's hymn which picks up the topic of unity between God (Spirit) and man, as shown in the dialogue. The text thus proceeds from general to more and more personal and intimate reflection.|$|E
5|$|The {{doorway to}} the Blessed Sacrament Chapel on the north wall of the nave is topped by carvings of shields {{representing}} three Christian religious centers, Jerusalem, Rome, and Canterbury, and flanked by carvings representing the seven virtues and corresponding seven vices.

5|$|The treatises cover a {{wide range}} of topics, {{including}} Symeon's defense against Stephen regarding his own views on the unity of the Holy Trinity. He also presents his doctrine on mysticism, the necessity of faith, the possibility of direct experience of God, the Baptism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit,</b> and more. The last four treatises were written during his exile, and discuss living a holy life while on earth, salvation through faith and good works, and the need for solitude if one wants to become a channel of divine grace to others.|$|E

5|$|Christian baptismal {{theology}} {{prior to}} the Reformation taught that sacraments, including baptism, are means or instruments through which God communicates grace to people. The sacrament was considered valid regardless of who administered it. Not everyone who received a sacrament, however, received the grace signified by the sacrament. Some medieval theologians spoke of an obstacle of mortal sin which blocks the grace of the sacrament, while others insisted that the recipient be positively open and responding in faith to the sacrament {{in order to receive}} any benefit. Baptism was believed to be used by the Holy Spirit to transform the believer, and offered the benefits of remission of sins, regeneration, and the indwelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit.</b> The sacrament of penance was believed to be necessary for forgiveness for sins committed after baptism.|$|E
5|$|Eliot invokes {{images of}} {{original}} sin and Adam's fall when talking about the past and points out that such events can be forgotten but can still affect mankind. Eliot brings {{in the image of}} Krishna to discuss how the past and future are related: Krishna, speaking to Arjuna, claims that death can come at any time and that men should always find the divine will instead of worrying about what their actions will bring. If an individual were to follow Krishna's words then {{they would be able to}} free their self from the limitations of time. Even if it cannot be fully attained, the effort in attempting it is still important. The way for mankind to understand the divine will is through prayer and through the power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit.</b>|$|E
5|$|Symeon endured severe {{opposition}} from church authorities, {{particularly from the}} chief theologian of the emperor's court, Archbishop Stephen, who at one time was the Metropolitan of Nicomedia. Stephen was a former politician and diplomat {{with a reputation for}} a thorough theoretical understanding of theology, but one which was removed from actual experience of the spiritual life. Symeon, in contrast, held the view that one must have actual experience <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> in order to speak about God, at the same time recognizing the authority of scripture and of the earlier church fathers. Their differing views on the source of authority to speak on spiritual matters was the cause of several years of intense conflict, ending with Symeon's eventual exile.|$|E

5|$|The {{church was}} founded by Aldo Benzi, who {{converted}} to Christianity after being healed from a pleurisy. Subsequent leader René Kennel, a former Mennonite farmer who became pastor of the churches in Saint-Dizier and in Joinville after discovering Pentecostalism through an evangelical Roma mission, has directed the church since 1977. Its main beliefs (expressed in a creed of eight articles of faith) and practices are nearly identical with those of most Evangelical and Pentecostal groups, with a special focus on miraculous gifts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> and proselytism. In the late 1990s the church was embroiled in many trials (often {{on the grounds of}} defamation or for financial issues), losing most of them. In 2006 a sex scandal within the church led the federation to be dissolved, and the church in Besançon became independent.|$|E
5|$|The first {{religious}} building raised after Milford Haven {{was founded}} was St. Katharine's and St. Peter's, an Anglican church, {{it is considered}} to be the town's parish church due to its central position within the town {{and the fact that it}} was built by Charles Francis Greville the founder of Milford Haven. Other Anglican buildings include St. David's in Hubberston, St. Mary's (1927) and the Church <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> (1971) in Hakin and St. Peter's and St. Cewydd's in Steynton. St. David's is a Norman church and is believed to be the oldest building in Milford still in regular use. St. Mary's was built in 1927 largely by funds from the local residents of Hakin.|$|E
