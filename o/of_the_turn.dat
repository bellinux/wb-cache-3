5|$|One torque {{generated}} by a tire, called the self aligning torque, is caused by asymmetries in the side-slip {{along the length of}} the contact patch. The resultant force of this side-slip occurs behind the geometric center of the contact patch, a distance described as the pneumatic trail, and so creates a torque on the tire. Since the direction of the side-slip is towards the outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> the force on the tire is towards the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn.</b> Therefore, this torque tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the side-slip, away from the direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> and therefore tends to increase the radius <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E

5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of the contact patch and the lean of the tire in a turn. The portion of the contact patch towards the outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> is actually moving rearward, {{with respect to the}} wheel's hub, faster {{than the rest of the}} contact patch, because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of the contact patch slip on the pavement in opposite directions, generating a torque that tends to turn the front wheel in the direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> and therefore tends to decrease the turn radius.|$|E

5|$|Once a turn is established, {{the torque}} {{that must be}} applied to the {{steering}} mechanism in order to maintain a constant radius at a constant forward speed depends on the forward speed and the geometry and mass distribution of the bike. At speeds below the capsize speed, described below in the section on Eigenvalues and also called the inversion speed, the self-stability of the bike will cause it to tend to steer into the turn, righting itself and exiting the turn, unless a torque is applied in the opposite direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn.</b> At speeds above the capsize speed, the capsize instability will cause it to tend to steer out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> increasing the lean, unless a torque is applied in the direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn.</b> At the capsize speed no input steering torque is necessary to maintain the steady-state turn.|$|E

5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is to lean the upper torso {{relative to the}} bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves the view of the road, and improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee to the inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> relative to the bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E

5|$|Third, {{because the}} front and rear tires can have {{different}} slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. When understeering, the steering angle must be greater, and when oversteering, the steering angle must be less than it would be if the slip angles were equal to maintain a given turn radius. Some authors even use the term counter-steering to refer to the need on some bikes under some conditions to steer in the opposite direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> (negative steering angle) to maintain control in response to significant rear wheel slippage.|$|E

5|$|While {{the initial}} steer torque and steer angle are both {{opposite}} the desired turn direction, {{this may not}} be the case to maintain a steady-state turn. The sustained steer angle is usually in the same direction as the turn, but may remain opposite to the direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> especially at high speeds. The sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is usually opposite the turn direction. The actual magnitude and orientation of both the sustained steer angle and sustained steer torque of a particular bike in a particular turn depend on forward speed, bike geometry, tire properties, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. Once in a turn, the radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in lean angle, and this can be accomplished by additional countersteering out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> to increase lean and decrease radius, then into the turn to decrease lean and increase radius. To exit the turn, the bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering more into the turn in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle of lean.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{were divided}} in their reviews <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Turn</b> of the Screw. The acting and {{tone of the}} {{production}} were generally praised, but the plot's divergences from the original story were less well received. A particular disagreement concerned the film's horrific elements; some critics considered it to be genuinely scary, while others suggested that the horror was not fully effective. The original story has been much analysed owing to its ambiguity, and critics disagreed {{about the extent to}} which the film succeeded in portraying this trait. Academic analyses found the film considerably less ambiguous than the novella. The Turn of the Screw was released on DVD on 1 March 2010 in the UK and on 28 April 2015 in North America.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} wishes {{to take over}} a {{territory}} through diplomatic means, they must initiate dialogue with the local leader. If the player has a high enough popularity, the local leader may invite them to a sporting event, such as elephant race or a game hunting session, which will give the player an opportunity to unite that territory under their faction. If the player's popularity is not high enough, they may hold a Durbar festival in an attempt to impress the local leaders. If diplomacy fails, the player has the option to invade any territory by force. Soldiers can be hired through payments of gold; however, if the player does not have a sufficient amount of gold at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> a rebellion may start. Rebellions will sometimes initiate lethal encounters with assassins, in which the player-character must defend themselves through sword combat. Additionally, the player can bring assassins to their side by successfully launching an attack on their temple. The game will end once either all of the territories are united, or if the player-character is assassinated.|$|E

5|$|Productions {{during the}} 1980s {{included}} the company's first presentations of Pelléas and Mélisande (1981), Parsifal (1986) and Billy Budd (1988). 1980s productions that {{remained in the}} repertory for many years included Xerxes directed by Hytner, and Rigoletto and The Mikado directed by Jonathan Miller. In 1984 ENO toured the United States; the travelling company, led by Elder, consisted of 360 people; they performed Gloriana, War and Peace, The Turn of the Screw, Rigoletto and Patience. This was the first British company {{to be invited to}} appear at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, where Patience received a standing ovation and Miller's production of Rigoletto, depicting the characters as mafiosi, was greeted with a mixture of enthusiasm and booing. In 1990 ENO was the first major foreign opera company to tour the Soviet Union, performing the Miller production <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Turn</b> of the Screw, Pountney's production of Macbeth, and Hytner's much-revived Xerxes.|$|E
5|$|Score Entertainment {{created a}} Sonic X {{collectible}} card game for two players, released in 2005. Players battle for Chaos Emeralds; whoever gets three first wins. Each turn, both players lay out five cards face-down and flip over {{one at a}} time; whichever card has a lower number value is eliminated. Eliminating the other player's cards and combining the special abilities of one's own cards allows one to score rings; whichever player has the most rings at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> wins an Emerald. As the game does not emphasize collecting rare cards, a few booster packs are enough to build a competent deck. KidzWorld gave a positive review, praising its ease of learning, low cost, and inherent strategy, but also noting that it feels more like a generic card game with Sonic characters than like a wholly Sonic-based product.|$|E
