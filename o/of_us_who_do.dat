6000|$|Bert paid no {{attention}} to the colonel or to the judge, or to any of this buzzing. [...] "They are just talking to hear themselves make a noise, anyway. They talk about building up the country--they who are a rope and a grindstone around the necks of the rest <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> the work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are a good}} {{reader of}} hearts, O Macumazana, {{almost as good as}} I am. But {{remember}} that there is One Who writes upon the book of the heart, Who is the Lord <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> but read, and that what He writes, that will befall, strive as we may, for in His hands is the future." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> {{not fully}} {{understand}} {{the dynamics of the}} political changes...felt deserted by a poet." [...] "Dylan is our poet - not our leader...Dylan...is communicating where it counts." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Its {{time for}} those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>dont</b> belong here to leave," [...] Alixus says, {{and with that}} she, Vinod, OBrien, and Sisko beam up. As the colonists go about their business, two young {{children}} are left staring {{at the point where}} the four vanished.|$|R
6000|$|... "So we all are," [...] the Bishop {{declared}} warmly. [...] "We are all pacifists in {{the sense}} that we are lovers of peace. There is not one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not deplore the horrors of to-day. There is not one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> is not passionately seeking for the master mind which can lead <b>us</b> out <b>of</b> it." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{to those}} <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not look on a {{play as a}} mere {{question}} of pantomime and clowning psychological interest is everything, I determined, consequently, {{to make a change}} in the precise moment of revelation. This determination, however, was entered into long before I had the opportunity of studying the culture, courtesy, and critical faculty displayed in such papers as the Referee, Reynolds', and the Sunday Sun.|$|E
60|$|Of all the companions {{of light}} which {{endeavor}} to induce it to forsake its former simple habits, {{there is not}} one which has the influence possessed by glass. When light and glass get together it is difficult to divine what tricks they are going to perform. But some of these are very interesting, if they are a little wild, and there are very few <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not enjoy them.|$|E
60|$|I wanted more. I {{looked from}} {{face to face}} {{surrounding}} me, and in most of them I found reflected undoubtedly my own sensations. If it {{be a good thing}} to excite this blood thirst in the modern man, then the Mensur is a useful institution. But is it a good thing? We prate about our civilisation and humanity, but those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not carry hypocrisy to the length of self-deception know that underneath our starched shirts there lurks the savage, with all his savage instincts untouched. Occasionally he may be wanted, but we never need fear his dying out. On the other hand, it seems unwise to over-nourish him.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is my firm belief," [...] said Mrs. Belmont gravely, [...] "that {{there was}} not one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not rise to a greater height during those days in the desert than ever before or since. When our sins come to be weighed, much may be forgiven us for the sake of those unselfish days." ...|$|R
60|$|It was no {{time for}} the follies of sentiment. There was not one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not know secret {{satisfaction}} at the occurrence of each death. Luckiest of all was Israel Stickney in casting lots, so that in the end, when he passed, he was a veritable treasure trove of clothing. It gave a new lease of life to the survivors.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know {{my father}} is very much of your opinion," [...] Walter said, [...] "and {{that he has no}} {{confidence}} whatever in the King of France, and considers that French interference is responsible for the want of success which has attended us. At any rate, there is scarcely one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not hate the French, and certainly, if we had to choose between the two countries, we should choose England." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pride," [...] {{observed}} Mary, who piqued herself {{upon the}} solidity of her reflections, [...] "is {{a very common}} failing, I believe. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced {{that it is very}} common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am an individualist," [...] she {{admitted}} simply. [...] "But I am at least logical in that philosophy, and the individualists who attend the churches to-day are not. The inconsistency {{of their lives}} is what makes those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not go to church doubt the efficacy of their creed, {{which seems to have}} no power to change them. The majority of people in St. John's are no more Christians than I am. They attend service once a week, {{and the rest of the}} time they are bent upon getting all they can of pleasure and profit for themselves. Do you wonder that those who consider this spectacle come inevitably to the conclusion that either Christianity is at fault, is outworn, or else that it is presented in the wrong way?" ...|$|E
60|$|That Belgium {{is now one}} of the European kingdoms, {{living by}} its own laws, resting on its own bottom, with a king and court, palaces and {{parliament}} of its own, is known to all the world. And a very nice little kingdom it is; full of old towns, fine Flemish pictures, and interesting Gothic churches. But in the memory of very many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not think ourselves old men, Belgium, as it is now called--in those days it used to be Flanders and Brabant--was a part of Holland; and it obtained its own independence by a revolution. In that revolution the most important military step was the siege of Antwerp, which was defended on the part of the Dutch by General Chasse, with the utmost gallantry, but nevertheless ineffectually.|$|E
6000|$|... "My engineer, Tom Daley, reached Casey's side {{just the}} instant before he died," [...] said General Lodge, {{resuming}} his story. [...] "In fact, Daley {{was the only}} one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> see Casey alive.... Casey's last words were 'ambush--Sooz--' Deep Cut,' and then 'me fri'nd Neale!'... We were at a loss to understand what he meant--that is, at first. We found Casey with this little note-book and his pipe tight between his teeth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is so like him," [...] she declared. [...] "He makes friends everywhere. A day is sufficient. He gives such {{wonderful}} parties. I do {{not know}} why we all like to come, but we do. I suppose that we all get half-a-dozen invitations to supper most nights, but there is not one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not put off everything to sup with Mr. Selingman. He sits in the middle--oh, you shall watch him to-night!--and what he says I {{do not know}}, but we laugh, and then we laugh again, and every one is happy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{pretend to}} be modest, Cuthbert. You know well enough they will be hung, and more than that, they will be a success. I would wager a hundred dollars to a cent on it, though you haven't as yet settled on the subjects. You {{know that you are}} Goudé's {{favorite}} pupil and that he predicts great things for you, and there is not one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not agree with him. You know what Goudé said of the last thing you did. 'Gentlemen, I should be proud to be able to sign my name in the corner of this picture, it is admirable.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1940, Priestley {{wrote an}} essay for Horizon magazine, where he criticised George Bernard Shaw for {{his support of}} Stalin: [...] "Shaw presumes that his friend Stalin has {{everything}} under control. Well, Stalin may have made special arrangements to see that Shaw comes to no harm, {{but the rest of}} us in Western Europe do not feel quite so sure of our fate, especially those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not share Shaw's curious admiration for dictators." ...|$|E
50|$|All {{those that}} may come by, know what should be done. Each one in one’s way. Thus, Low Bap will proudly take all the credit and burden for the next step, {{that will lead to}} the fair ones. It will {{continue}} bothering history and it will believe even deeper in the dream. Noone chose those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> Low Bap, we chose it ourselves.

[...] Starhawk believes that the Earth is a living entity, and that faith-based activism can reconnect oneself to basic human needs. She posits core religious values of community and self-sacrifice as important to eco-pagan movements, as well as the broader environmental justice movement.|$|E
50|$|In {{the studies}} {{referred}} to, a comparison is made between dermatoscopy and an artificial situation of only naked eye examination.

60|$|When {{we arrived}} {{in the open air}} we passed through the court of the Invalids, where {{thousands}} of people had been assembled, but where the benches were now quite bare. Then we came on to the terrace before the place: the old soldiers were firing off the great guns, which made a dreadful stunning noise, and frightened some <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not care to pass before the cannon and be knocked down even by the wadding. The guns were fired in honor of the King, who was going home by a back door. All the forty thousand people who covered the great stands before the Hotel had gone away too. The Imperial Barge had been dragged up the river, and was lying lonely along the Quay, examined by some few shivering people on the shore.|$|R
5000|$|In February 1991, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld Bakker's {{conviction}} on {{the fraud}} and conspiracy charges, but voided Bakker's 45-year sentence, {{as well as}} the $500,000 fine, and ordered that a new sentencing hearing be held. The court held that Potter's statement at sentencing that Bakker's actions resulted in [...] "those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> have a religion" [...] being lampooned as [...] "saps from money-grubbing preachers or priests" [...] was evidence that he had injected his own religious beliefs into considering Bakker's sentence.|$|E
5000|$|Whitney {{became the}} {{director}} of the Hauenstein Center for Presidential Studies at Grand Valley State University in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 2003. The Center has experienced tremendous growth during his tenure. [...] "Gleaves Whitney is a real treasure for those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> presidential studies and work in the field of presidential history," [...] said award-winning biographer H. W. Brands. [...] "He’s {{also one of the most}} effective entrepreneurs in the business of higher education," [...] he continued.

5000|$|When Thirumal {{decided to}} go to Thiruvananthapuram the temple boy of Sri Rangam and a Brahmin fall on his feet and asked humbly, [...] "Your greatness, your {{children}} The Santror are suffering due to the activities of the cruel Kalineesan, why you are going {{to the land of the}} neesan?" [...] Thirumal replied, [...] "Before I go to help the Santror, I must advise the neesan. Otherwise during the judgment he will claim, 'You took birth among the santror and so you destroyed me and my dynasty.' In order to overcome that I must advise him beforehand." [...] Again the temple boy praised him and asked, [...] "The kalineesan will perform pujas, he will light lamps for you, if you don’t accept it what is the situation <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> the same?" [...] From the very first moment the Kaliyan entered this world I stopped accepting all these things. And only after destroying the Kaliyan and appointing a rule of Dharma in the world, will I accept those things. By saying this Thirumal walked towards Thiruvananthapuram.|$|E

5000|$|He {{was chosen}} to head the General Medical Council’s 2014 review into the {{differences}} between the scores achieved by black and minority ethnic GP trainees and their white counterparts in the clinical skills assessment component of the Membership exam of the Royal College of General Practitioners. The RCGP was challenged in the courts by the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin. He analysed data on more than 5,000 candidates who sat the CSA exam over a two-year period. He said ‘subjective bias due to racial discrimination may be a cause’ of the different pass rates for between white and non-white graduates. [...] "Many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> work in this area describe the problem of unconscious bias. So I think that what might be happening, especially with the white British graduates compared to the ethnic minority British graduates, is that - without realising it even perhaps - they may be assessing it in a different way. So I don't think that it's the examiners saying 'oh we don't like ethnic minorities' - it doesn't work like that anymore. It's all this unconscious stuff that goes on which we need to be aware of." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – It {{is vital}} to the future of our society that {{individuals}} from diverse backgrounds and experiences excel in the engineering profession. While those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not represent a minority demographic might feel intimidated to take a proactive role in encouraging and mentoring towards a healthy, diverse climate in engineering, this paper strives to open a dialogue, potentially dispel paradigms, and provide starting resources to accomplish this very goal.

40|$|The {{daily work}} of an internist varies: Diseases take dif-ferent forms, and every patient is a {{distinct}} individual. The work of the medical journal editor—at least those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> it full time—is much more stereotyped. Every day has its repetitive tasks, and every week its rhythms. We take this occasion to look up from our routines {{to reflect on the}} journal’s progress and to scan the horizon for storm clouds and for opportunity. In an editorial that focuses on change, we begin by noting several signature Annals features: methodologically sound, original research articles that advance the content of internal medicine practice; high-quality clinical guidelines produced by the American College of Physicians (ACP) and the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force; rigorous sys-tematic reviews and meta-analyses (including the new com-parative effectiveness reviews commissioned by the Agenc...|$|E
6000|$|All <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> {{not vote}} for Mr. Buchanan, taken together, are a {{majority}} of four hundred thousand.

Thus let bygones be bygones; let past differences as nothing be; and with steady eye on the real issue let us reinaugurate the good old [...] "central idea" [...] of the republic. We can do it. The human heart is with us; God is with us. We shall again be able, not to declare that [...] "all States as States are equal," [...] nor yet that [...] "all citizens as citizens are equal," [...] but to renew the broader, better declaration, including both these and much more, that [...] "all men are created equal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may well}} say that, Father; {{and we do}} our full share towards making it so; but having the room makes all the {{difference}} to us. They have no time to cook downstairs, and it is done by our own servants; but it is handy to have the wine and other things within call, and if we always do as well, we shall have good cause to feel mighty contented; for barring that we are rather crowded, we are just as well off here as we were at home, saving only in the quality of the spirits. Now, Father, we cannot ask you up there, seeing that it is your own village, but {{if you would like to}} take a walk through the camps we should be glad to show you what there is to be seen, and can give you a little of the real cratur. It is not much of it that we have been able to bring ashore, for the general is mighty stiff in the matter of baggage, but I doubt whether there is one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not manage to smuggle a bottle or two of the real stuff hidden in his kit." ...|$|R
