5|$|Both Pyrrhocorax {{species have}} {{extensive}} geographical ranges and large populations; neither {{is thought to}} approach the thresholds for the global population decline criteria of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and they are therefore evaluated as being <b>of</b> <b>Least</b> Concern. However, some populations, particularly on islands such as Corsica and La Palma are small and isolated.|$|E
5|$|Common and {{widespread}} throughout New Guinea, the hooded pitohui is evaluated {{as a species}} <b>of</b> <b>least</b> concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In one study {{of the effects of}} small subsistence gardens, populations of hooded pitohui were lower in disturbed agricultural habitat in the lowlands, compared to undisturbed forest, but actually increased in disturbed habitat higher in the mountains.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The present paper gives a {{classification}} of the expressive power <b>of</b> two-variable <b>least</b> fixed-point logics. The main results are: 1. The two-variable fragment <b>of</b> monadic <b>least</b> fixed-point logic with parameters is as expressive as full monadic least fixed-point logic (on binary structures). 2. The two-variable fragment <b>of</b> monadic <b>least</b> fixed-point logic without parameters is as expressive as the two-variable fragment <b>of</b> binary <b>least</b> fixed-point logic without parameters. 3. The two-variable fragment <b>of</b> binary <b>least</b> fixed-point logic with pa-rameters is strictly more expressive than the two-variable fragment <b>of</b> monadic <b>least</b> fixed-point logic with parameters (even on finite strings). 1...|$|R

5|$|Estimates of the {{breeding}} {{population of the}} Eurasian rock pipit vary, but may {{be as high as}} 408,000 pairs, of which around 300,000 pairs are in Norway. Despite slight declines in the British population and some range expansion in Finland, the population is considered overall to be large and stable, and for this reason it is evaluated as a species <b>of</b> <b>least</b> concern by the IUCN.|$|E
5|$|Fragmentation of {{woodland}} {{can lead}} to local losses of breeding birds, but the species' range is still expanding. It has a large population and huge breeding area, and is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as being <b>of</b> <b>least</b> concern.|$|E
5|$|Since 1996, {{the alpine}} pika has been rated a species <b>of</b> <b>least</b> concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This {{is because it}} is widespread, with no known {{population}} decline. Despite the lack of data relating to its current population state, it {{is thought to have}} a stable trend, with some isolated populations exhibiting some variation. It has been regionally red-listed in China and Mongolia as a species <b>of</b> <b>least</b> concern, and about 12% of its population in Mongolia is found in protected areas.|$|E

5|$|Since 1998, the mallard {{has been}} rated {{as a species}} <b>of</b> <b>least</b> concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This is {{because it has a}} large range–more than 20,000km2 (7700mi2)–and because its {{population}} is increasing, rather than declining by 30% over ten years or three generations and thus is not warranted a vulnerable rating. Also, the population size of the mallard is very large.|$|E
5|$|The Cape sparrow is an {{abundant}} and familiar bird of human habitations and cultivation {{in most of}} southern Africa. It is not believed to be threatened, and accordingly is listed as a species <b>of</b> <b>least</b> concern on the IUCN's Red List. It can be an agricultural pest, especially of grain cultivation and vineyards.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} may be hunted by birds of prey, infested by parasites such as fleas, or {{act as an}} {{involuntary}} host to the common cuckoo, but overall its population is large and stable, and it is therefore evaluated as a species <b>of</b> <b>least</b> concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E

5|$|The {{blackcap}} has a {{very large}} range, and its population in Europe is estimated at 25–49million breeding pairs. Allowing for birds breeding in Africa and Asia, the total population is between 80–196million individuals.

5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} {{is closely}} related to some other members of its genus. It has a number of subspecies, some of which are distinctive enough to be potential new species.

5|$|The {{number of}} {{individual}} mourning doves {{is estimated to}} be approximately 475 million. The large population and its vast range explain why the mourning dove is considered to be <b>of</b> <b>least</b> concern, meaning that the species is not at immediate risk. As a gamebird, the mourning dove is well-managed, with more than 20 million (and up to 40–70 million) shot by hunters each year.|$|E

5|$|The {{pink-backed pelican}} {{has a large}} {{population}} ranging over much of Sub-Saharan Africa. In the absence of substantial threats or evidence of declines across its range, its conservation status is assessed as being <b>of</b> <b>Least</b> Concern. Regional threats include the drainage of wetlands and increasing disturbance in southern Africa. The species is susceptible to bioaccumulation of toxins and {{to the destruction of}} nesting trees by logging.|$|E
5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} {{is not well}} known {{and appears to be}} {{naturally}} uncommon or rare across a widespread area; however, it is almost certainly under-reported due to its canopy lifestyle. The IUCN considers this species to be a species <b>of</b> <b>Least</b> Concern due in part to its large range. While the IUCN has not estimated the population size, it believes it is declining due to habitat loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} {{declined}} in numbers {{in parts of}} northern and western Europe since the 1980s due to fewer grassland invertebrates being available as food for growing chicks.
