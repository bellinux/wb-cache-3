25|$|According to Neil deGrasse Tyson, {{the central}} {{difference}} between the nature of science and religion is that the claims of science rely on experimental verification, while the claims of religions rely on faith, and these are irreconcilable approaches to knowing. Because of this both are incompatible as currently practiced and the debate of compatibility or incompatibility will be eternal. Philosopher and physicist Victor J. Stenger's view is that science and religion are incompatible due to conflicts between approaches <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>and</b> the availability of alternative plausible natural explanations for phenomena that is usually explained in religious contexts.|$|E
500|$|Locke {{does not}} {{dedicate}} much space in Some Thoughts Concerning Education to outlining a specific curriculum; {{he is more}} concerned with convincing his readers that education is about instilling virtue and what Western educators would now call critical-thinking skills. Locke maintains that parents or teachers must first teach children how to learn and to enjoy learning. As he writes, the instructor [...] "should remember that his business is not so much to teach [...] all that is knowable, as to raise in him a love and esteem of knowledge; and to put him in the right way <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>and</b> improving himself." [...] But Locke does offer a few hints as to what he thinks a valuable curriculum might be. He deplores the long hours wasted on learning Latin and argues that children should first be taught to speak and write well in their native language, particularly recommending Aesop's Fables. [...] Most of Locke's recommendations are based on a similar principle of utility. So, for example, he claims that children should be taught to draw because {{it would be useful to}} them on their foreign travels (for recording the sites they visit), but poetry and music, he says, are a waste of time. Locke was also at the forefront of the scientific revolution and advocated the teaching of geography, astronomy, and anatomy. Locke's curricular recommendations reflect the break from scholastic humanism and the emergence of a new kind of education—one emphasising not only science but also practical professional training. Locke also recommended, for example, that every (male) child learn a trade. Locke's pedagogical suggestions marked the beginning of a new bourgeois ethos that would come to define Britain in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.|$|E

2500|$|McGinn {{notes that}} the term unio mystica, {{although}} it has Christian origins, is primarily a modern expression. McGinn argues that [...] "presence" [...] is more accurate than [...] "union", since not all mystics spoke of union with God, and since many visions and miracles were not necessarily related to union. He also argues that we should speak of [...] "consciousness" [...] of God's presence, rather than of [...] "experience", since mystical activity is not simply about the sensation of God as an external object, but more broadly about [...] "new ways <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>and</b> loving based on states of awareness in which God becomes present in our inner acts." ...|$|E

[...] Rowling said that Dumbledore speaks for her, as he [...] "knows pretty much everything" [...] about the Harry Potter universe. Rowling {{mentioned}} that Dumbledore regrets [...] "that he has always {{had to be the}} one who knew, and who had the burden <b>of</b> <b>knowing.</b> <b>And</b> he would rather not know." [...] As a mentor to the central character Harry Potter, [...] "Dumbledore is a very wise man who knows that Harry is going to have to learn a few hard lessons to prepare him for what may be coming in his life. He allows Harry to get into what he wouldn't allow another pupil to do, and he also unwillingly permits Harry to confront things he’d rather protect him from." [...] In a 1999 interview, Rowling stated that she imagined Dumbledore [...] "more as a John Gielgud type, you know, quite elderly and– and quite stately." [...] During his time as a student, Dumbledore was in Gryffindor House. Rowling said in an interview that Dumbledore was about 150 years old. However, on her website, she states that Dumbledore was born in 1881, making him either 115 or 116 when he died.|$|E

60|$|It {{was with}} a queer {{commingling}} of pleasure and vexation that he entered the little chamber sacred to the birds, beasts, racquets, golf-clubs, and general young ladies' litter. Ferrand was standing underneath the cage of a canary, his hands folded on his pinched-up hat, a nervous smile upon his lips. He was dressed in Shelton's old frock-coat, tightly buttoned, and would have cut a stylish figure but far his look of travel. He wore a pair of pince-nez, too, which somewhat veiled his cynical blue eyes, and clashed a little with the pagan look of him. In {{the midst of the}} strange surroundings he still preserved that air <b>of</b> <b>knowing,</b> <b>and</b> being master of, his fate, which was his chief attraction.|$|E

There is an interesting volume by Professor Taine on the Dutch school, containing a valuable historical analysis of the influences which formed it; but full of the gravest errors, resulting from the confusion in his mind between color and tone, in consequence of which he imagines the Dutch painters to be colorists.|$|E

60|$|We {{must accept}} all of Mr. Wynell's {{statement}} or none; we cannot accept, like Mr. Pollock, only Godfrey's confession {{of owning a}} dangerous secret, without Godfrey's explanation {{of the nature of}} the danger. Against THAT danger (his knowing and taking no action upon what Oates had deposed) Godfrey's 'security' was Oates's other deposition, that his information was already in the Minister's hands, and that he had come to Godfrey by the Minister's orders. The invidiousness <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>and</b> not acting on Oates's 'dangerous secret,' Godfrey hoped, fell on the Minister rather than on himself. And it did fall on Danby, who was later accused of treason on this very ground, among others. Such is Wynell's evidence, true or false. C'est a prendre ou a laisser in bulk, and in bulk is of no value to Mr. Pollock's argument.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gerard de Stolberg was not, as yet, {{initiated}} {{into the}} thousand secrets in the chronicle {{of the great}} world: he knew but superficially the society in which he lived; and, therefore, he devoted his evening to the gathering of all the information which he could acquire from the indiscreet conversations of the people about him. His whole man became ear and memory; so much was Stolberg convinced {{of the necessity of}} becoming a diligent student in this new school, where was taught the art <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>and</b> advancing in the great world. In the recess of a window he learned more on this one night than months of investigation would have taught him. The talk of a ball is more indiscreet than the confidential chatter of a company of idle women. No man present at a ball, whether listener or speaker, thinks he has a right to affect any indulgence for his companions, and the most learned in malice will always pass for the most witty.|$|E
60|$|The Sports were {{to begin}} at two o'clock {{with a series of}} hundred-yards races, which {{commenced}} with the 'under twelve' (Cameron of Prater's a warm man for this, said those who had means <b>of</b> <b>knowing),</b> <b>and</b> culminated at about a quarter past with the open event, for which Welch was a certainty. By a quarter to the hour the places round the ropes were filled, and more visitors were constantly streaming in at the two entrances to the School grounds, while in the centre of the ring the band of the local police force--the military being unavailable owing to exigencies of distance--were seating themselves with the grim determination of those who know {{that they are going to}} play the soldiers' chorus out of Faust. The band at the Sports had played the soldiers' chorus out of Faust every year for decades past, and will in all probability play it for decades to come.|$|E

60|$|Being {{thoroughly}} {{convinced that}} the perfection of the creature consists in willing nothing but {{the will of the}} Creator, he spoke incessantly of God's good pleasure, and concluded almost all his letters with his desires <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>and</b> fulfilling it. He sacrificed all to that principle; even his ardent wishes to die for Jesus by the hands of the barbarians: for though he breathed after martyrdom, he well understood that the tender of our life is not acceptable to God, when he requires it not; and he was more fearful of displeasing him, than desirous of being a martyr for him. So that he died satisfied, when he expired in a poor cabin of a natural death, though he was at that very time on the point of carrying the faith into the kingdom of China: And it may be therefore said, that he sacrificed not only his own glory, but even that of Jesus Christ, to the good pleasure of God Almighty.|$|E

I want to go round corners and see what is there, to cross mountain ranges, to open boxes and parcels. Young animals at least have that disposition too.

I want to get as near as I can to the thrill of a dog going into a fight or the delight of a bird in the air. And not simply in the heroic field of war and the air do I want to understand. I want to know something of the jolly wholesome satisfaction that a hungry pig must find in its wash. I want to get the quintessence of that.|$|E
