2500|$|Point Pursuit: Same as Party Pursuit, except point {{scores are}} kept, and {{questions}} range from 250 to 1,000 points. [...] Players can also wager {{any or all}} of their scores on <b>one</b> <b>final</b> <b>question.</b> [...] Bonus points are earned for a wedge and for how much or how little time it took to answer a question.|$|E
60|$|There {{was another}} long pause, during which Harry kept his burning eyes fixed fast upon Sir Thomas, and Sir Thomas looked down uncomfortably at his boots and said nothing. Then {{the young man}} found voice again feebly to ask, almost in a whisper, <b>one</b> <b>final</b> <b>question.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>One</b> <b>final</b> <b>question</b> round {{was played}} with no stunt, with 40, 50, and 60 points {{available}} on each question (still only one question to a team, however).|$|E
50|$|The {{contestant}} {{with the}} highest score {{at the end of}} the game became the winner, won a prize and advanced to the bonus round. If the game ended in a tie, <b>one</b> <b>final</b> toss-up <b>question</b> was asked.|$|R
50|$|The round ended after 60 seconds, and {{the player}} in the lead gained initial control for the first round. If two players were tied, <b>one</b> <b>final</b> Sprint <b>question</b> was asked, with a correct answer or an {{incorrect}} answer by an opponent gaining control.|$|R
50|$|Once a team {{reached the}} ninth step, {{they had a}} choice to either end the turn and bank the prizes, or to attempt <b>one</b> <b>final</b> {{open-ended}} <b>question</b> for which conferring was allowed. If they attempted the question on that same turn and missed, they forfeited the un-banked prizes. The first team to correctly answer their <b>final</b> <b>question</b> won the game, banked any prizes still at risk, and advanced to the bonus round.|$|R
50|$|If {{there was}} a tie {{at the end of}} the Couch Up Round, <b>one</b> <b>final</b> <b>question</b> was played and whoever {{answered}} it correctly won the game for his/her team.|$|E
50|$|If {{the game}} {{ended in a}} tie, <b>one</b> <b>final</b> <b>question</b> set was played between the tied couples; {{as soon as one}} couple missed a question, their opponents won the game.|$|E
50|$|In {{case of a}} tie {{for first}} place, or a {{three-way}} tie at the end, <b>one</b> <b>final</b> <b>question</b> was asked, and the team who buzzed in with a correct answer {{moved on to the}} bonus round.|$|E
50|$|The two {{remaining}} saw the romantic lead's picture, and Dave asked each one {{a question about}} them (for example,"is that what you thought they'd look like?"). Then he asked each <b>one</b> a <b>final</b> <b>question.</b> When the questioning was finished, he picked which one {{would be the best}} choice for the romantic lead.|$|R
50|$|If a tie {{occurred}} between two contestants for last place, or if all three contestants tied {{for first place}} after time was called, <b>one</b> <b>final</b> toss-up <b>question</b> was given. The first person to buzz in with the correct answer advanced to the next round, and the other contestant was eliminated. An incorrect answer on that question resulted in elimination.|$|R
50|$|Beginning July 4, 1988, {{the winning}} {{contestant}} had to correctly predict <b>one</b> <b>final</b> audience poll <b>question.</b> To record their guess, the contestant used a special prop with a dial {{and the numbers}} 0 through 10 on it. The contestant moved the dial to the number they thought was correct, {{and if it was}} they won the car. Missing by one in either direction won the contestant $500 as a consolation prize, while any other incorrect guess won nothing. On the final episode, however, if the contestant was even one off, they still won the car.|$|R
50|$|If {{the match}} {{ended in a}} tie, <b>one</b> <b>final</b> <b>question</b> was played with the star of one {{contestant}}'s choosing; if the contestant agreed or disagreed correctly, he/she won the match; otherwise, the match went to the opponent.|$|E
50|$|Another early bonus round ended each {{episode of}} You Bet Your Life {{with the team}} who won the most money {{answering}} <b>one</b> <b>final</b> <b>question</b> for a jackpot which started at $1,000 and increased $500 each week until won.|$|E
50|$|If {{the game}} {{ended in a}} tie <b>one</b> <b>final</b> <b>question</b> was played. The team that buzzed in with the correct answer won the game; if they were wrong, their opponents {{automatically}} won, but they still got a free guess.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} win the prize fund that is banked, the {{surviving}} contestants of the last series of rounds work {{together as a team}} to beat the chaser in <b>one</b> <b>final</b> round of <b>questions.</b> Two question sets, A and B, are used in this round in which, prior to the round beginning, the contestants decide which to answer questions from, while the other set is set aside for the chaser. The round itself is divided into two phases-in the first phase, the contestants answer questions in order to earn themselves steps to keep them ahead of the chaser, while the second phase sees the chaser trying to match these steps, in order to [...] "catch" [...] the team and thus prevent them winning the prize fund.|$|R
50|$|If any {{contestant}} {{makes it}} to the <b>final</b> <b>question,</b> the ATM will offer them <b>one</b> <b>final</b> Ultimate Dare, which is typically much more difficult than the three previous dares; examples include having a stranger allow them to throw a slush drink at his face or having a stranger permit them to shave his head. Any contestant who successfully completes this dare wins the top prize of $10,000 (previously $15,000 in Season 1). Failure, however, also results in winning nothing and elimination from the game.|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological studies often rely on {{self-reported}} {{information as}} a source of drug exposure. Several studies have evaluated the accuracy of self-reported information on drug use. The influence of question structure on the accuracy of recall, however, has not been studied extensively in these studies. In this study we examined the recall accuracy of questionnaire information on drug use in a ongoing public health survey with special attention to the influence of question structure on sensitivity of recall. A sample of 372 hypertensive subjects for whom questionnaire information and pharmacy records were available was examined. Self-reported information on drug use was obtained through questions about medications used for a specific condition and <b>one</b> <b>final</b> open-ended <b>question.</b> This information was compared with the pharmacy medication history. About 71 % of all drugs that were currently in use according to the pharmacy records were recalled through the self-administered questionnaire, and 94 % of all drugs mentioned in the questionnaire could be traced in the pharmacy records. Recall sensitivity was higher for questions about medications used for a specific indication (88 %) than for the open-ended question (41 %). The type of drug that was used might have caused part of this difference in recall. We conclude that questionnaire structure might be of influence on the accuracy of recall of self-reported drug use, and more attention should be paid to the structure of questions on drug use...|$|R
5000|$|Six {{people in}} the United Kingdom won a £50,000 (or $62,000) bonus after beating the mob and {{answering}} <b>one</b> <b>final</b> <b>question</b> correctly. Another person beat the mob, but rather than answer the bonus question, he took home over £16,000.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the game, <b>one</b> <b>final</b> <b>question</b> {{determined}} the outcome of the game. Whoever won that question won the game and a vacation or $1,000 cash plus the right to take off all of the other person's clothes (except his/her G-string).|$|E
50|$|If a tie {{occurs at}} the end of the round, the host would ask <b>one</b> <b>final</b> <b>question</b> to both {{contestant}}s. The first contestant to buzz in with a correct response automatically wins the game, but an incorrect answer results in an automatic loss.|$|E
50|$|Tie Game for First, Positive Score: Tied players {{participate}} in a tie-breaker round, which consists of <b>one</b> <b>final</b> toss-up clue; the player who rings in and gives the correct question advances. A player cannot win by default, and must give the correct question to win. Should neither player offer a correct response, the question is thrown out and edited out of the final broadcast; only the <b>final</b> <b>question</b> that determines the winner is broadcast. In the final, the tie-breaker is used only {{if there is a}} tie after the aggregate. The tie-breaker round would later be added into non-tournament play.|$|R
40|$|Replacing {{fossil fuels}} with biomass in the {{production}} of energy carriers, materials and specialty chemicals is a challenge that now confronts humanity. Numerous questions demand an answer: in which applications we shall use the limited biomass resource; how the raw materials are best refined; if biorefineries can be integrated in existing industries; and what policy instruments are required to realise the biorefineries of the future. There is not <b>one</b> <b>final</b> answer to <b>questions</b> like these. However, different systems studies can provide us with complementary pieces of the puzzle. These can be valuable by themselves, or be brought together into a larger and more complex picture. Systems Perspectives on Biorefineries 2014 contains twelve chapters that address different topics related to the immensely important issue of how the world’s biomass resources can, or should, be converted into the goods we need and desire. Systems Perspectives on Biorefineries is an evolving ebook with annual updates. You may also want to read Systems perspectives on Renewable Power and Systems Perspectives on Electromobility...|$|R
50|$|Both {{teams were}} {{required}} to wager {{at least half of}} their scores on the <b>final</b> <b>question.</b> Answering it correctly added the amount of the wager, while answering it incorrectly deducted it. The team leading after the <b>final</b> <b>question</b> won the game.|$|R
50|$|Marshall read <b>one</b> <b>final</b> <b>question</b> to {{the celebrity}} panel. As {{in the main}} game, each team member tried to match the celebrities' responses, and each match earned one roll of the dice, for a maximum of five rolls. However, the team was {{guaranteed}} at least one roll.|$|E
5000|$|Winning contestants (other {{than the}} children) had the {{opportunity}} to answer <b>one</b> <b>final</b> <b>question.</b> Getting this question correct, the individual was awarded the [...] "big payoff" [...] of a mink coat or a trip to Europe, or both. Bess Myerson modeled the mink coat and escorted the contestants on stage.|$|E

50|$|It was {{the first}} time since 2001 that the <b>final</b> <b>question</b> posed on the ladies came from the judges. The {{previous}} pageants had <b>final</b> <b>questions</b> coming from the current Miss Universe and the delegates participating in the final five themselves.|$|R
50|$|From the Celebrity {{series and}} second regular series, the rules {{regarding}} the end game changed. The team {{who wins the}} final no longer wins a guaranteed £2,000, but instead {{move on to the}} <b>final</b> <b>question,</b> for which play is now mandatory. A correct answer to this <b>final</b> <b>question</b> wins the rolling jackpot, which now starts at £3,000 and increases by the same amount each show until it is won. Conferring on this <b>final</b> <b>question</b> is not permitted.|$|R
50|$|During {{the final}} competition, the semi-finalists are {{announced}} {{and go on}} to compete in swimsuit and evening gown. From 1983 to 2002 all semi-finalists also competed in an interview competition as well as both swimsuit and evening gown, followed by <b>one</b> or two <b>final</b> interview <b>questions.</b> In 2003, a new format was introduced where the top fifteen competed in evening gown, the top ten competed in swimsuit and the top five competed in the <b>final</b> <b>question.</b> In 2006, the order of competition was changed where the top fifteen competed in swimsuit and the top ten in evening gown. The latest competition format was used since 2008 the final not broadcast on TV, where the top fifteen both competed in swimsuit and evening gown, and the top five competed in the <b>final</b> <b>question</b> who all signed up by a panel of judges.|$|R
50|$|A {{memorial}} is {{held for}} the students killed, then I-na is kidnapped unnoticed. <b>One</b> <b>final</b> <b>question</b> is posed: have the person who killed his daughter step forward and confess. The person in question, a now-demented Chang-wook, reveals himself and is killed by the mastermind, who {{turns out to be}} Mr. Kim. I-na is then freed by So-yeong.|$|E
5000|$|In season 1, {{the winner}} {{could choose to}} take $500 or [...] "double down" [...] and attempt to answer <b>one</b> <b>final</b> <b>question</b> {{correctly}} for $1,000, but a wrong answer meant he or she got nothing. If a game ended in a tie, the double down question was not offered and the tied contestants split the $1,000 prize automatically.|$|E
50|$|Carrying {{over from}} SMTV Live, each episode {{featured}} a chosen member {{from the audience}} asking Ant questions. Each one Ant got wrong earned the contestant a prize. The audience member could then gamble all their winnings on <b>one</b> <b>final</b> <b>question,</b> winning a bonus if Ant gave an incorrect answer. If Ant gave the correct answer, the contestant walked home with nothing.|$|E
50|$|Three {{questions}} were {{played with the}} first two for single points and the third and <b>final</b> <b>question</b> for double. The first team to reach 200 points after the <b>final</b> <b>question</b> won the game. If, after the third round, neither team reached 200 points, another Double Points round would be played.|$|R

50|$|On 13 April 2015, Hot Seat had {{its first}} revamp since it {{launched}} in 2009. The intro was slightly changed, {{a new set}} with higher resolution LED screens was introduced and new graphics using the Eurostile font. A new lifeline was also added for the <b>final</b> <b>question,</b> the Switch lifeline. The constant on the <b>final</b> <b>question</b> could use it to change the <b>final</b> <b>question</b> to another <b>one</b> of the same value. This lifeline was dropped after the 8 May 2015 episode, but was reinstated for episodes airing between 21 and 25 September of the same year.|$|R
