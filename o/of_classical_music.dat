5|$|Bache's major {{accomplishment}} was {{the establishment}} of Liszt's music in England, to which he selflessly devoted himself between 1865 and his death in 1888. This was {{at the height of}} the War of the Romantics, when conservative and liberal musical factions openly argued about the future <b>of</b> <b>classical</b> <b>music</b> and the merits of the compositions written in their respective schools. Bache featured several of the orchestral and choral works through an annual series of concerts, which he single-handedly funded, organised and promoted. Likewise, he played an annual series of solo recitals that incorporated Liszt's piano music.|$|E

5|$|His compositions, {{particularly}} those of his later period, are notable for their complex textures, rich harmonies and orchestration, and the elaborate use of leitmotifs—musical phrases associated with individual characters, places, ideas, or plot elements. His advances in musical language, such as extreme chromaticism and quickly shifting tonal centres, greatly influenced the development <b>of</b> <b>classical</b> <b>music.</b> His Tristan und Isolde is sometimes described as marking the start of modern music.|$|E

5|$|Spokane {{offers an}} array of musical {{performances}} catering {{to a variety of}} interests.

5|$|The {{music of}} this album is mostly {{original}} and {{a combination of}} progressive rock, hard rock and psychedelic rock, but with a harder edge and with the guitar parts in more evidence than in the past. This was due both {{to the growth of}} guitarist Ritchie Blackmore as a songwriter and to the conflicts within the band over the fusion <b>of</b> <b>classical</b> <b>music</b> and rock proposed by keyboard player Jon Lord and amply implemented in the band's previous releases.|$|E
5|$|The song {{begins with}} austere, {{classical}} strings while the chord progression emphasizes tonic, submediant and flattened leading-tone chords. For the second phrase, {{which includes a}} dramatic crescendo, rhythm and ambient electronic effects are added gradually. Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens, authors from Madonna's Drowned Worlds, commented that the song is strongly inspired by different forms <b>of</b> <b>classical</b> <b>music,</b> notably contemporary classical music such as neoromanticism, as well as Italian opera composers and pieces such as Puccini's Madama Butterfly and Verdi's Aïda. Madonna's vocals throughout the song lack vibrato, and have drawn comparisons to medieval music.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} of the album {{is similar to that}} of their debut, with four original songs and three rearranged covers, although the tracks are longer, the arrangements more complex and the sound more polished than on Shades of Deep Purple.

5|$|Additionally, {{the film}} {{featured}} {{a number of}} pieces <b>of</b> <b>classical</b> <b>music,</b> as the main Bond girl, Kara Milovy, is a cellist. Mozart's 40th Symphony in G minor (1st movement) is performed by the orchestra at the Conservatoire in Bratislava when Koskov flees. As Moneypenny tells Bond, Kara is next to perform Alexander Borodin's String Quartet in D major, and the finale to Act II of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro (in Vienna) also features. Before Bond is drugged by Kara, she is practising the Cello solo from the first movement of Dvořák's cello concerto in B minor. At {{the end of the}} film, Kara and an orchestra (conducted onscreen by John Barry) perform Tchaikovsky's Rococo Variations to rapturous applause.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Roger Deakins {{discussed}} {{the look of}} the film with the Coens during pre-production.

Bill and Jacqui Landrum did all of the choreography for the film. For his dance sequence, Jack Kehler went through three three-hour rehearsals. The Coen brothers offered him three to four choices <b>of</b> <b>classical</b> <b>music</b> for him to pick from and he chose Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. At each rehearsal, he went through each phase of the piece.|$|E

5|$|Classical {{music was}} brought to the United States with some of the first colonists. European {{classical}} music is rooted in the traditions of European art, ecclesiastical and concert music. The central norms of this tradition developed between 1550 and 1825, centering on {{what is known as the}} common practice period. Many American classical composers attempted to work entirely within European models until late in the 19th century. When Antonín Dvořák, a prominent Czech composer, visited the United States from 1892 to 1895, he iterated the idea that American classical music needed its own models instead of imitating European composers; he helped to inspire subsequent composers to make a distinctly American style <b>of</b> <b>classical</b> <b>music.</b> By the beginning of the 20th century, many American composers were incorporating disparate elements into their work, ranging from jazz and blues to Native American music.|$|E
5|$|Pritchard {{was also}} music {{director}} of Glyndebourne Festival Opera in Sussex, and it was partly due to his influence that in 1964 the LPO replaced the RPO as Glyndebourne's resident orchestra, providing the players with stable guaranteed work in the slack summer months. The number of LPO concerts in the provinces fell during the 1960s, and {{ceased to be a}} major factor in the orchestra's finances. During the 1960s the orchestra gave fund-raising concerts in which guests from outside the world <b>of</b> <b>classical</b> <b>music</b> appeared, including Danny Kaye, Duke Ellington and Tony Bennett. Its regular complement at the end of the decade was 88 players.|$|E
5|$|Early English composers in {{classical}} music include Renaissance artists Thomas Tallis and William Byrd, followed up by Henry Purcell from the Baroque period. German-born George Frideric Handel became a British subject and {{spent most of}} his composing life in London, creating some of the most well-known works <b>of</b> <b>classical</b> <b>music,</b> The Messiah, Water Music, and Music for the Royal Fireworks. One of his four Coronation Anthems, Zadok the Priest, composed for the coronation of George II, has been performed at every subsequent British coronation, traditionally during the sovereign's anointing. There was a revival in the profile of composers from England in the 20th century led by Edward Elgar, Benjamin Britten, Frederick Delius, Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams and others. Present-day composers from England include Michael Nyman, best known for The Piano, and Andrew Lloyd Webber, whose musicals have achieved enormous success in the West End and worldwide.|$|E
