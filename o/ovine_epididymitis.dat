40|$|Actinobacillus seminis is a gram-negative {{bacterium}} of the Pasteurellaceae family that {{is involved in}} <b>ovine</b> <b>epididymitis.</b> Looking for a protein specific to this species, we determined the protein profile of subcellular fractions of A. seminis (American Type Culture Collection number 15768) : proteins from the outer membrane (OMPs), inner membrane (IMPs), and cytoplasm (CPs). These profiles provide the first data, to our knowledge, regarding subcellular fractions of A. seminis. In the OMP fraction, we identified a protein with a molecular mass of 75 kDa {{that proved to be}} immunogenic and apparently specific for A. seminis. This conclusion was based on the reaction of hyperimmune serum of rabbits inoculated with whole cells of A. seminis that was tested against sonicated complete cells of reference strains and field isolates of Brucella ovis, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni. No protein of these bacteria cross-reacted with the 75 -kDa protein of A. seminis. Furthermore, when each type of hyperimmune serum was tested against the sonicated cells and each of the subcellular fractions of A. seminis, it did not recognize the A. seminis 75 -kDa protein. We also isolated and identified this protein in microvesicles released to the culture supernatant. The results suggest that the 75 -kDa protein could be used to establish a diagnostic test specific for <b>ovine</b> <b>epididymitis</b> caused by A. seminis...|$|E

In 2011, a test and cull eradication program was con-ducted in a flock that consisted of 2, 400 ewes and 93 rams in Hungary.

40|$|Abstract. The seroresponse against Brucella ovis of 8 intrapreputially and 6 {{intravenously}} infected rams and 9 ewes infected through mating {{was analyzed}} by electrophoretic immunoblotting. Additionally, 87 sera from chronically infected rams that were shedding B. ovis in their semen, 226 sera from rams belonging to infected flocks, and 324 sera from false-positive {{complement fixation test}} (CFT) reactors were examined. In all infected animals, antibody reactivity was predominantly found against 5 B. ovis components of 8 - 12, 17, 19, 29, and 63 kD, of which the 29 -kD antigen was most dominant in the seroresponse. Antibodies to the 29 -kD component were present in 93 - 100 % of the infected sheep in each infected group, whereas the frequency of antibodies to the 4 other components varied considerably among and within the different groups. No reactivity against the 29 -kD antigen {{was found in the}} false-positive CFT reactors. By using monoclonal antibodies against known bacterial macromolecules, the immunodominant antigens were identified as rough lipopolysaccharide (8 - 12 kD), outer membrane proteins (17, 19, 29 kD), and a heat-shock protein (63 kD).

40|$|Brucella ovis is an {{economically}} important cause of epididymitis, orchitis and impaired fertility in rams. Similar symptoms {{have been reported}} in male red deer in New Zealand. B. ovis is occasionally associated with abortion in ewes, and can cause increased perinatal mortality in lambs. Etiology <b>Ovine</b> <b>epididymitis</b> is caused by Brucella ovis, a Gram-negative coccobacillus or short rod. This organism is a facultative intracellular pathogen. Genetic and immunological evidence suggests that all members of the genus Brucella are closely related, and some microbiologists have proposed that this genus be reclassified into a single species (B. melitensis), which contains many biovars. This proposal is controversial, and both taxonomic systems are currently in use. The multiple species nomenclature is used in this factsheet. Species Affected B. ovis infects sheep, as well as farmed red deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in New Zealand. Experimental infections {{have been reported in}} goats and cattle, but {{there is no evidence that}} these species are infected in nature. An attempt to infect mouflon (Ovis musimon) by intraconjunctival injection failed; however, transient bacteremia and seroconversion may occur in this species...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a research on Brucella ovis infection in rams in the Pirot Municipality of South Serbia. A positive result with indirect immunoenzyme test (i-ELISA) was confirmed in 67 (29. 8 %) and suspicious in 31 (13. 8 %) out of 225 tested rams. Complement fixation test (CFT) {{was used as}} a confirmation test on 67 ELISA positive sera and gave positive reaction in 41 (61. 2 %) ram serum samples. Rams originated from 113 flocks with 4751 sheep, from 28 villages in the Pirot Municipality of southern Serbia. Clinical examination was performed on epididymis and testes of 12 rams from 7 seropositive flocks by inspection and palpation. The examination showed scrotum asymmetry and unilateral increase of the epididymistail in 5 (41. 7 %) out of 12 seropositive rams. Pathomorphological examination of testes and epididymis confirmed pathological changes in 7 (58. 3 %) of the 12 examined rams. One-sided epididymitis with pronounced hypertrophy of the epididymitis was also confirmed. Twelve rams were tested for the presence of bacteria, i. e. 21 epididymis, testes and lymph nodes samples. We isolated 20 Brucella strains from 11 (91. 7 %) of the 12 examined animals. All isolates were identified with bacteriological and molecular techniques as B. ovis. This is the first evidence of <b>ovine</b> <b>epididymitis</b> (B. ovis) in Republic of Serbia...|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{present the}} {{surveillance}} data on Brucella melitensis, B. suis, and B. ovis infection in cattle, sheep, goats, and swine in Croatia obtained in 2008 by serological, bacteriological, and molecular methods for diagnostics of brucellosis in domestic animals. Methods We serologically tested 42 785 cattle serums, 22 686 {{sheep and goat}} serums, and 28 520 swine serums using the Rose Bengal test, complement fixation test, and various immunosorbent assays. We also tested 10 173 ram blood samples for B. ovis infection using the complement fixation test. Bacteriological examination was conducted on 214 samples collected from 34 serologically positive animals. Different molecular methods were employed in the identification and typing of 20 isolates from the samples. Results B. melitensis biovar (bv.) 3 was confirmed with different identification methods in 2 flocks in 2 Croatian counties and B. suis bv. 2 in 3 flocks in 3 counties. B. melitensis in cows was confirmed {{for the first time}} in Croatia. Infection with B. ovis was serologically confirmed in 202 rams in 12 counties. Conclusions In 2008, the size of the brucellosis-affected area in Croatia and the efficiency of detection and prevention of brucellosis in sheep, goats, and swine were satisfactory. Infection with B. melitensis in cattle was confirmed for the first time and possible links for infection in humans were detected. More efficient measures for suppression and control of <b>ovine</b> <b>epididymitis</b> are required and a new strategy may be necessary for complete eradication of this disease...|$|E
