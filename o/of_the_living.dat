5|$|A vampire is a {{being from}} {{folklore}} that subsists by feeding {{on the life}} essence (generally {{in the form of}} blood) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>living.</b> In European folklore, vampires were undead beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century.|$|E
5|$|An {{unpublished}} {{study conducted}} by Vernon Meidlinger-Chin in 2013 suggested that previous studies lacked focus on endocranial details.

The endocast features clarified the dissimilarity of the skull with those of Allosauroids and Coelurosaurs giving Cryolophosaurus a basal position in Theropoda.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Physiological {{changes and}} chronic {{diseases}} arising during aging process increase risk <b>of</b> accident <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elderly, especially <b>the</b> elderly <b>living</b> alone at their homes. Home accidents {{are the most}} commonly health problem in the elderly. This study was carried out to describe home safety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elderly <b>living</b> in a city or rural area using a home safety checklist. MEDHODS: 512 living in Turkey (330 in city; 182 in rural area) were evaluated via face-to-face interview using a home safety checklist during a period between December and March in 2007. In addition to sociodemographics, a questionnaire including home characteristics and life style of participants was applied. To describe home safety level, Home Safety Checklist was used. RESULTS: 51. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants <b>living</b> in a city and 42. 8 % living in rural area were aged 65 - 69 years. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> participants <b>living</b> in a city, 59. 4 % were living with their partners (61. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants <b>living</b> in rural area). While 63. 9 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants <b>living</b> in a city {{reported that they had}} a private room in their homes, 53. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants <b>living</b> in rural area reported that they had a private room in their homes. 2. 1 % of participants living in a city had an excellent home safety score. Percentage for participants living in rural area was 0. 5. CONCLUSION: The results obtained from this study show that majority <b>of</b> houses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elderly <b>living</b> in Turkey were unsafe and hazardous. Therefore, health providers and architects should work together to prevent home accidents. [TAF Prev Med Bull 2008; 7 (4. 000) : 297 - 300...|$|R

5|$|Scientific {{understanding}} of Iguanodon {{has evolved over}} time as new information has been obtained from fossils.

5|$|The philosopher Aristotle was {{the most}} {{influential}} scholar <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> world from classical antiquity. Though his early work in natural philosophy was speculative, Aristotle's later biological writings were more empirical, focusing on biological causation and the diversity of life. He made countless observations of nature, especially the habits and attributes {{of plants and animals}} in the world around him, which he devoted considerable attention to categorizing. In all, Aristotle classified 540 animal species, and dissected at least 50. He believed that intellectual purposes, formal causes, guided all natural processes.|$|E

Nineteen Goosebumps HorrorLand books were published, and books in the series mainly featured two stories. The series continued in 2012 with new stories featuring some of the series' most memorable villains, including Slappy the Dummy, the Lawn Gnomes and others. The first book of the spin-off series Goosebumps Most Wanted, Planet of the Lawn Gnomes, was released in October 2012.|$|E
