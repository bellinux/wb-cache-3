5|$|Cross-country skiing has {{two basic}} {{propulsion}} techniques, which apply to different surfaces: classic (undisturbed snow and tracked snow) and skate skiing (firm, smooth snow surfaces). The classic technique {{relies on a}} wax or texture on the ski bottom under the foot for traction <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> to allow the skier to slide the other ski forward in virgin or tracked snow. With the skate skiing technique a skier slides on alternating skis on a firm snow surface at an angle {{from each other in}} a manner similar to ice skating. Both techniques employ poles with baskets that allow the arms to participate in the propulsion. Specialized equipment is adapted to each technique and each type of terrain. A variety of turns are used, when descending.|$|E
25|$|When {{using the}} outrigger, skiers do not rotate their arms as this changes the {{location}} of the ski <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow.</b> Outriggers are used to stop using a technique that involves bringing the skiers elbows from their raised position down to their hips while pushing the outriggers down.|$|E

25|$|An {{avalanche}} (also {{called a}} snowslide) is a rapid flow of snow down a sloping surface. Avalanches are typically triggered in a starting zone from a mechanical {{failure in the}} snowpack (slab avalanche) when the forces <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> exceed its strength but sometimes only with gradually widening (loose snow avalanche). After initiation, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they entrain more snow. If the avalanche moves fast enough some of the snow may mix with the air forming a powder snow avalanche, which {{is a type of}} gravity current.|$|E

25|$|Hydrologists {{from the}} University of Colorado have {{investigated}} the impacts of beetle-infested forests on the water cycle, in particular, snow accumulation and melt. They concluded that dead forests will accumulate more snowpack {{as a result of}} thinner tree canopies and decreased snow sublimation. These thinned canopies also cause faster snow melt by allowing more sunlight through to the forest floor and lowering the snowpack albedo, as a result of needle litter <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> surface. Augmented snowpack coupled with dead trees that no longer transpire will likely lead to more available water.|$|E
25|$|Outriggers {{are used}} to stop using a {{technique}} that involves bringing the skiers elbows from their raised position down to their hips while pushing the outriggers down. When using the outrigger, skiers do not rotate their arms as this changes {{the location of the}} ski <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow.</b> Skiers with below the knee amputations get on and off the ski lift using the same technique as able-bodied skiers. Cerebral palsy skiers in this class may have better balance while using skis than they would otherwise. This presents challenges for coaches who are working with the skier. Compared to other skiers in the class, the skier with cerebral palsy may tire more quickly.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} the motion {{analysis}} of skier gliding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> actual <b>snow</b> field using inertial sensors. It is difficult to measure the motion of skier gliding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> actual <b>snow</b> field since <b>the</b> gliding velocity is fast and the measurement area is large. Therefore, few studies have analyzed ski turns in gliding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> actual <b>snow</b> field. It is necessary to analyze <b>the</b> skier gliding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> actual <b>snow</b> field in resolving the mechanism of ski turns. In our previous study, we developed the motion measurement method of skier using inertial and magnetic field sensors. The 3 D posture is estimated by applying the sensor fusion method, and the method can estimate the 3 D posture compensating the drift error of gyro sensor and reducing the effect of dynamic acceleration of accelerometer. Furthermore, we developed the sensor fusion method estimating the 3 D posture in local coordinate by the information of inertial sensors attaching the body segments. The joint angle of skier in gliding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> actual <b>snow</b> field can be estimated by this method and inverse kinematics. We conducted the measurement experiment by skier gliding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> actual <b>snow</b> field. <b>The</b> inertial sensors and the GPS receiver were attached to the body segments {{and the top of}} skier, respectively. Skier conducted carving and skidding turns in this experiment. We calculated the joint angles of skier by the information of inertial sensors, and the switchovers of turns are estimated by the GPS receiver output. The results of motion analysis indicated the major feature of skier's motion and the difference between carving and skidding turns. Therefore, the analysis results can be used to the skill rating, the clarification of the mechanism of ski turns and the suggestion of more ideal turning form...|$|R

25|$|On Saturday, a {{group of}} people from Zermatt had started to ascend the Hohlicht heights, above the Zmutt valley, which {{commanded}} the plateau of the Matterhorn Glacier. They returned after six hours, and reported that they had seen the bodies lying motionless <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow.</b> They proposed that the rescuers should leave on Sunday evening, so as to arrive upon the plateau at daybreak on Monday. Whymper and J. M'Cormick decided to start on Sunday morning. The guides of Zermatt, threatened with excommunication by their priests if they failed to attend the early mass, were not willing to go. Other people came to help: J. Robertson, J. Phillpotts and another Briton offered themselves and their guides, Josef Marie Lochmatter and his brother Alexander Lochmatter of St. Niklaus in the canton Valais and Franz Andenmatten. Other guides (Frederic Payot and Jean Tairraz) also volunteered.|$|E
25|$|Ibn Battuta {{recorded}} {{that while}} in Bulghar {{he wanted to}} travel further north into the land of darkness. The land is snow-covered throughout (northern Siberia) and {{the only means of}} transport is dog-drawn sled. There lived a mysterious people who were reluctant to show themselves. They traded with southern people in a peculiar way. Southern merchants brought various goods and placed them in an open area <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> in the night, then returned to their tents. Next morning they came to the place again and found their merchandise taken by the mysterious people, but in exchange they found fur-skins which could be used for making valuable coats, jackets, and other winter garments. The trade is done between merchants and the mysterious people without seeing each other. As Ibn Battuta was not a merchant and saw no benefit of going there he abandoned the travel to this land of darkness.|$|E
25|$|Persistent cold {{temperatures}} {{can either}} prevent new snow from stabilizing or destabilize the existing snowpack. Cold air temperatures <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> surface produce a temperature gradient in the snow, because the ground temperature {{at the base}} of the snowpack is usually around °C, and the ambient air temperature can be much colder. When a temperature gradient greater than 10°C change per vertical meter of snow is sustained for more than a day, angular crystals called depth hoar or facets begin forming in the snowpack because of rapid moisture transport along the temperature gradient. These angular crystals, which bond poorly to one another and the surrounding snow, often become a persistent weakness in the snowpack. When a slab lying on top of a persistent weakness is loaded by a force greater than the strength of the slab and persistent weak layer, the persistent weak layer can fail and generate an avalanche.|$|E

25|$|While honing {{his forces}} at Macha, Belgrano ordered several {{reconnaissance}} missions on the enemy. He chose {{one of his}} best officers, Lieutenant La Madrid, to collect intelligence about the royalist headquarters at Yocalla. La Madrid departed the republican camp with four Dragoons and a native guide. After an icy-cold night, which ended in a heavy snowfall, the small detachment was just 400 metres away from the enemy stronghold. Not only their recce mission went unnoticed, but they also surprised a royalist patrol marching <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> and took five prisoners. Only a troop of local natives, loyal to Pezuela, harassed La Madrid's group during their retreat along the defile of Tinguipaya, and informed Castro about his path through the mountains. When the captives were presented to Belgrano, he recognized two of them - a corporal and a soldier - as members of the royalist army defeated in Salta. These men had sworn not to turn their arms on the republicans again. To make an example, Belgrano had them executed by a shooting squad. Their bodies were later beheaded, and their heads, along with a reinforcement of eight Dragoons, were sent to La Madrid, still close to the enemy.|$|E

Work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Snow</b> Hill Queensway commenced on 24 July 2006 and the work on St Chad's Circus commenced on 10 August 2006 with the removal of the subways beneath the site. St. Chad's Circus was turned into two linked traffic signal controlled T-junctions. In addition, re-waterproofing and structural improvements to the St Chad's underpass were carried out above the tunnel. Work on Snow Hill Queensway was completed in January 2007. The St Chad's Circus slip roads were closed temporarily from 14 January 2007 to 28 May 2007. Work on St Chad's Circus was expected to be completed in October 2007, however, good weather conditions resulted in work being completed in July 2007.
