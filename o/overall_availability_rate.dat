40|$|Bibliography: p. 175 - 197. Academic {{libraries}} in South Africa {{are facing}} the challenge of tighter budgets, increasing student enrolments, greater diversity in students' backgrounds and library experience, and a call for greater accountability to all the stakeholders. The effectiveness of a library service {{can be measured in}} terms of the availability and accessibility of library materials, two attributes of a library's document delivery capability. This study focused on the availability of prescribed materials for undergraduate students in an academic library. It involved a micro-evaluation of the immediate materials <b>availability</b> <b>rate</b> in a short loan collection, by using a combination of a quantitative simulation study, and a qualitative user survey. Generally, the <b>availability</b> <b>rates</b> determined were high, which suggests a high degree of collection adequacy. However, the user study confirmed that many SLC users experienced difficulties in using the system, indicating a need for continuous user education programmes and constant dialogue between the staff and the users concerning future service improvements. The study indicated that <b>overall</b> materials <b>availability</b> <b>rates</b> can be misleading if accepted at face value. A introspective analysis {{of the reasons for the}} non-availability of high-demand materials revealed hidden access barriers such as poor information retrieval skills on the part of the users and certain inefficient organisational procedures on the part of the library. The study reiterates the fundamental importance of constructive communication between the various stakeholders in meeting the educational goals of the institution and the necessity of regular library performance evaluation to ensure a dynamic, proactive service. The coexistence of print-based and electronic resources in the forseeable future underscores the importance of convenience and accessibility factors in making required documents available to the users...|$|R

Experimental designs commonly used in the Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments (DACE) and Classical Design of Experiments (DOE) are evaluated and compared for application by means of simulation experiments. Furthermore, response surface and kriging models are evaluated for the approximation of the input-output relationships. The most accurate experimental design by approximation model combination is used to explore the design space, both in terms of the <b>overall</b> <b>availability</b> and the percentage time offline.

40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} {{the availability of}} allied health care in nursing homes in the Netherlands, and its dependency on characteristics of the nursing home. Methods. Structured surveys by telephone were carried out {{in a sample of}} 100 from a country total of 286 somatic (for somatic patients only) and combined (with units for both somatic and psychogeriatric patients) nursing homes. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to determine relationships between the availability of care and the type of nursing home, its country location (urban/non-urban) and the presence of specific wards/units within the nursing home. Results. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy were present in almost all nursing homes (99 % and 93 % respectively); 92 % of the nursing homes offered speech- and language therapy and 88 % had dietetics available. Average <b>availability</b> <b>rates</b> were: 2. 16 full time equivalents per 100 beds/places for physiotherapy, 0. 96 for occupational therapy, 0. 38 for speech- and language therapy and 0. 18 for dietetics. Somatic nursing homes and nursing homes with stroke-units, day-care, or outpatient care present, had higher <b>availability</b> <b>rates</b> on allied health care. Conclusions. Allied health care disciplines varied in terms of full-time equivalents per 100 beds/places. Per discipline also a wide variation exists in full-time equivalents per 100 beds/places among all participating nursing homes, regardless of their type. Characteristics of nursing homes had small effects on <b>availability</b> <b>rates.</b> International research is recommended in order to compare data and eventually reach consensus on optimal <b>availability</b> <b>rates</b> of allied health care in nursing homes, tuned to the demand...|$|R

40|$|Software-Defined Networking (SDN) {{promises}} {{to improve the}} programmability and flexibility of networks, {{but it may also}} bring new challenges that need to be explored. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} present a quantitative assessment of the properties of SDN backbone networks to determine whether they can provide similar availability to the traditional IP backbone networks. To achieve this goal, we have completed the following steps: i) we formalized a two-level availability model that is able to capture the global network connectivity without neglecting the essential details; ii) we proposed Markov models for characterizing the single network elements in both SDN and traditional networks; iii) we carried out an extensive sensitivity analysis of a national and a world-wide backbone networks. The results have highlighted the considerable impact of operational and management (O&M) failures on the <b>overall</b> <b>availability</b> of SDN. High O&M failure intensity may reduce the availability of SDN as much as one order of magnitude compared to traditional networks. Moreover, the results show that the impact of software and hardware failures on the <b>overall</b> <b>availability</b> of SDN can be significantly reduced through proper overprovisioning of the SDN controller(s) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This project {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) at a small enterprise finishing product specifications according to customer specifications in the developing country of India. This company had never established any performance measurement before. Therefore, an appropriate indicator was elaborately selected for the case study, and OEE was chosen. OEE is employed as a simple indicator, {{but it is still}} an effective method for analyzing the efficiency of a single machine and an integrated machinery system. The case study of OEE was carried out from set-up stage to full implementation. Several processes were carried out to establish the OEE indicator. OEE helped the company identify the primary problems concerning the <b>availability</b> <b>rate</b> and performance efficiency. The management made the decisions by relying on OEE results and its details, and mandated the elimination of the root causes of breakdown losses and speed losses.
