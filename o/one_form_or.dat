5|$|NEPA {{has been}} emulated, in <b>one</b> <b>form</b> <b>or</b> another, {{by more than}} one hundred other countries, and many states have also {{established}} “mini NEPAs.” When national government agencies first started to prepare EISs, there were no professional associations dedicated to the planning and problem solving that NEPA demanded. Subsequently, Caldwell's efforts in formulating NEPA, and later promoting it, led to formation of the National Association of Environmental Professionals (NAEP), a national professional association of persons who prepare EISs.|$|E

5|$|Interest in Monteverdi revived in {{the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries among music {{scholars}} in Germany and Italy, although he was still regarded as essentially a historical curiosity. Wider interest in the music itself began in 1881, when Robert Eitner published a shortened version of the Orfeo score. Around this time Kurt Vogel scored the madrigals from the original manuscripts, but more critical interest was shown in the operas, following {{the discovery of the}} L'incoronazione manuscript in 1888 and that of Il ritorno in 1904. Largely through the efforts of Vincent d'Indy, all three operas were staged in <b>one</b> <b>form</b> <b>or</b> other, during {{the first quarter of the}} 20th century: L'Orfeo in May 1911, L'incoronazione in February 1913 and Il ritorno in May 1925.|$|E

The positive reaction to the reintroduction included over one million mentions on Twitter. This tied into a major push by the company to utilize social media as a free marketing tool to millennials, who overwhelmingly utilize interactive media to communicate and prefer companies that utilize these tools.|$|E
5|$|When Diocletian resigned, chaos ensued, {{but after}} the chaos had subsided, most of his reforms {{remained}} in effect. While the Emperor Constantine the Great did enact some revisions to this constitution, the most significant change over the centuries was in {{the abolition of the}} Caesares. Ultimately this constitution survived, in <b>one</b> <b>form</b> <b>or</b> another, until the Western Roman Empire fell in 476. Diocletian's division of the Empire into west and east set the stage for ages to come, and was a significant factor behind the ultimate division of the Christian church into western Roman Catholic and eastern Greek Orthodox, while his division of the Empire into prefectures and dioceses is used by the Catholic Church to this day.|$|E

Culinary spices have been cultivated in Kerala for millennia and they are characteristic of its cuisine. Rice is a dominant staple that is eaten at all times of day. A majority of the breakfast foods in Kerala are made out of rice, in <b>one</b> <b>form</b> <b>or</b> the other (idli, puttu, appam, or idiyappam), tapioca preparations, or pulse-based vada. These may be accompanied by chutney, kadala, payasam, payar pappadam, appam, chicken curry, beef fry, egg masala and fish curry. Lunch dishes include rice and curry along with rasam, pulisherry and sambar. Sadhya is a vegetarian meal, which is served on a banana leaf and followed {{with a cup of}} payasam. Popular snacks include banana chips, yam crisps, tapioca chips, unniyappam and kuzhalappam. Seafood specialties include karimeen, prawns, shrimp and other crustacean dishes.|$|E
5|$|The {{video game}} Duke Nukem Forever spent fifteen years in development, from 1996 to 2011. It is a first-person shooter for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, {{developed}} by 3D Realms, Triptych Games, Gearbox Software and Piranha Games. It is {{a sequel to}} the 1996 game Duke Nukem 3D, {{as part of the}} long-running Duke Nukem video game series. Intended to be groundbreaking, Duke Nukem Forever has become infamous in the video games industry and was considered vaporware due to its severely protracted development schedule; the game had been in development under 3D Realms since 1996. Director George Broussard, one of the creators of the original Duke Nukem game, first announced the title's development in April 1997, and promotional information for the game was released in <b>one</b> <b>form</b> <b>or</b> another from 1997 until its release in 2011.|$|E
