5|$|By the 21st century, Highway 82 {{had grown}} to four lanes. It was easier for traffic to get to Aspen but did not resolve the {{congestion}} that developed when it got there. Since the 1970s various plans to alleviate the congestion had been put forth, some involving ballot initiatives decided by the voters of the city and/or county.

5|$|In August 1802, Gia Long retaliated {{against the}} {{captured}} Tây Sơn leadership who had executed {{his family in}} the 1770s. The surviving {{members of the family}} and its leading generals and their families were executed. The remains of Quang Trung and his queen were exhumed and desecrated, and his son, the last Tây Sơn monarch Quang Toản was bound to four elephants and torn apart. Gia Long repealed the changes enacted by Quang Trung and reverted to the prior Confucian orthodoxy. This included restoring the civil service to the forefront <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> making, ahead of the army, and reversed Quang Trung's education reforms, which put science before the study of Confucian literature.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Army of Africa {{crossed the}} Gibraltar Strait, using Junkers Ju 52 {{transport}} planes provided by Nazi Germany, without any loyalist Air Force interference {{owing to the}} confusion and lack <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> of the Spanish Republican side. The massive airlift of troops from Spanish Morocco was the world's first long-range combat airlift and it allowed Franco's troops to join General Queipo de Llano's forces in Seville. Their quick movement allowed them to meet General Mola's Northern Army and secure most of northern and northwestern Spain, as well as central and western Andalusia. The Republican Government ended up with controlling {{almost all of the}} Eastern Spanish coast and central area around Madrid, as well as Asturias, Cantabria and part of the Basque Country in the north. Mola was keen {{to create a sense of}} fear within Nationalist-controlled areas. There was a massive purge of freemasons, and a wide part of the left, including some moderate socialists.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein {{marked the end}} of Model's special {{relationship}} with Hitler, who on 21 January 1945 issued an order that all the divisions of Army Group B would thenceforth be personally responsible to him to limit Model's operational freedom <b>of</b> <b>decision.</b> Any suggestion of its withdrawal back to the river Rhine to obtain a better fighting position - given the Third Reich's weakening strength against the Allied torrent of men and material - was forbidden, and it was ordered to conduct its actions from now on upon the strategic basis of not yielding an inch of ground and an abandonment of tactical manoeuvre.|$|E

40|$|In applied measurement, {{test scores}} are usually {{transformed}} to decisions. Analogous to classical test theory, the reliability <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> {{has been defined as}} the consistency <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> on a test and a retest or on two parallel tests. Coefficient kappa (Cohen, 1960) is used for assessing the consistency <b>of</b> <b>decisions.</b> This coefficient has been developed for assessing agreement between nominal scales. It is argued that the coefficient is not suited for assessing consistency <b>of</b> <b>decisions.</b> Moreover, it is argued that the concept consistency <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> is not appropriate for assessing the quality <b>of</b> a <b>decision</b> procedure. It is proposed that the concept consistency <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> be replaced by the concept optimality <b>of</b> the <b>decision</b> procedure. Two types of optimality are distinguished. The internal optimality is the risk <b>of</b> the <b>decision</b> procedure with respect to the true score the test is measuring. The external optimality is the risk <b>of</b> the <b>decision</b> procedure with respect to an external criterion. For assessing the optimality <b>of</b> a <b>decision</b> procedure, coefficient delta (van der Linden & Mellenbergh, 1978), which can be considered a standardization of the Bayes risk or expected loss, can be used. Two loss functions are dealt with: the threshold and the linear loss functions. Assuming psychometric theory, coefficient delta for internal optimality can be computed from empirical data for both the threshold and the linear loss functions. The computation of coefficient delta for external optimality needs no assumption of psychometric theory. For six tests coefficient delta as an index for internal optimality is computed for both loss functions; the results are compared with coefficient kappa for assessing the consistency <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> with the same tests...|$|R
5|$|The {{obligation}} {{of a professional}} medical care provider to alleviate suffering may occasionally come into conflict with the obligation to prolong life. If a terminally ill person prefers to be painless, despite {{a high level of}} sedation and a risk of shortening their life, they should be provided with their desired pain relief (despite the cost of sedation and a possibly slightly shorter life). Where a person is unable to be involved in this type <b>of</b> <b>decision,</b> the law and the medical profession in the United Kingdom allow the doctor to assume that the person would prefer to be painless, and thus the provider may prescribe and administer adequate analgesia, even if the treatment may slightly hasten death. It is taken that the underlying cause of death in this case is the illness and not the necessary pain management.|$|E
5|$|The {{same idea}} of using a DAG to {{represent}} a family of paths occurs in the binary decision diagram, a DAG-based data structure for representing binary functions. In a binary decision diagram, each non-sink vertex is labeled {{by the name of}} a binary variable, and each sink and each edge is labeled by a 0 or 1. The function value for any truth assignment to the variables is the value at the sink found by following a path, starting from the single source vertex, that at each non-sink vertex follows the outgoing edge labeled with the value of that vertex's variable. Just as directed acyclic word graphs {{can be viewed as a}} compressed form of tries, binary decision diagrams can be viewed as compressed forms <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> trees that save space by allowing paths to rejoin when they agree on the results of all remaining decisions.|$|E
5|$|Together, the Permanent Members {{form the}} North Atlantic Council (NAC), a body which meets {{together}} {{at least once}} a week and has effective governance authority and powers <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> in NATO. From time to time the Council also meets at higher level meetings involving foreign ministers, defence ministers or heads of state or government (HOSG) and it is at these meetings that major decisions regarding NATO's policies are generally taken. However, it is worth noting that the Council has the same authority and powers of decision-making, and its decisions have the same status and validity, at whatever level it meets. France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States are together referred to as the Quint, which is an informal discussion group within NATO. NATO summits also form a further venue for decisions on complex issues, such as enlargement.|$|E

5|$|Using {{conventional}} GSM systems {{was rejected}} also because GSM lacks {{many of the}} functionalities of TETRA, such as group conversations, dispatcher centers, and direct communication. In addition, Global System for Mobile Communication – Railway (GSM-R) was considered, but rejected {{because of the lack}} of trans-border functionality and the need for more base stations, and thus higher investment costs, and longer start-up time for calls. The technology was considered because the Norwegian National Rail Administration was at the time building a GSM-R network to cover the entire Norwegian railway network. Another reason that TETRA was preferred was that at the time <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> there were five manufacturers of TETRA equipment and only two for GSM-R. TETRA also allows a fall-back system, where a base station can allow communication between users within the range of the base station, even if the central parts of the network break down.|$|E
