5|$|Characteristics <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> dome eruptions include shallow, long-period and hybrid seismic activity, {{which is}} {{attributed}} to excess fluid pressures in the contributing vent chamber. Other characteristics <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> domes include their spherical dome shape, cycles of dome growth over long periods, and sudden onsets of violent explosive activity. The average rate of dome growth {{may be used as}} a rough indicator of magma supply, but it shows no systematic relationship to the timing or characteristic <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> dome explosions.|$|E
5|$|After {{the major}} {{collapse}} approximately 5,000years ago, subsequent eruptions <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> and tephra built up the modern summit cone until about {{as recently as}} 1,000years ago. As many as 11 Holocene tephra layers have been found.|$|E
5|$|Edziza's shield volcanoes {{are built}} {{almost entirely of}} fluid lava flows. They formed as a result <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> flowing out in all {{directions}} from central summit vents and from groups of vents, building a broad, gently sloping cone of flat, domical shape. They are built up slowly by the accretion of thousands <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> flows of highly fluid basaltic lava, which spread widely over great distances, and then cool as thin, gently dipping sheets. In some shield volcano eruptions, basaltic lava has poured out quietly from fissure vents instead of central vents, flooding the surrounding countryside with lava flow upon lava flow, forming Edziza's broad lava plateau.|$|E

40|$|The {{progress}} <b>of</b> the 1914 <b>lava</b> flows on {{the western}} side of Sakurajima Volcano was examinedin detail by analyzing the photographs taken during the eruption and then the extrusion rateof the lava was estimated. The reproduction <b>of</b> the <b>lava</b> flows was tried by the numerical simula-tion {{on the assumption that the}} viscosity <b>of</b> the <b>lava</b> was constant.

The viscosity <b>of</b> the extruded <b>lava</b> was estimated to be (2 - 3) xlO 9 poises. The reproduced lava flows, however, disagreed with the actual ones in their lateral spreading. The simulated lava flows tend to spread more widely than the actual ones. In the case <b>of</b> theactual <b>lava</b> flows, it is expected that the temperature <b>of</b> the <b>lava</b> flows decreases faster on thesides <b>of</b> the <b>lava</b> flows than in the main stream.

5|$|There are {{two types}} of eruptions in terms of activity, {{explosive}} eruptions and effusive eruptions. Explosive eruptions are characterized by gas-driven explosions that propels magma and tephra. Effusive eruptions, meanwhile, are characterized by the outpouring <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> without significant explosive eruption.|$|E
5|$|After {{an initial}} {{explosive}} eruption, extrusion of gas-depleted dacite magma commonly forms lava domes. Growing lava domes are inherently unstable, and collapse of their steep sides often generates pyroclastic flows <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> blocks and ash that can travel several miles. Such {{a sequence of}} events is recorded by the deposits related to the emplacement of Chaos Crags domes between 1,100 and 1,000years ago.|$|E
5|$|An {{earthquake}} at 8:32:17a.m. PDT (UTC−7) on Sunday, May 18, 1980, {{caused the}} entire weakened north face to slide away, creating the largest landslide ever recorded. This allowed the partly molten, high-pressure gas- and steam-rich {{rock in the}} volcano to suddenly explode northwards toward Spirit Lake in a hot mix <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> and pulverized older rock, overtaking the avalanching face.|$|E
5000|$|Some of {{the most}} ancient {{geological}} remnants of basaltic plains lie in Canada's Precambrian Shield. Eruption <b>of</b> plateau <b>lavas</b> near the Coppermine River southwest of Coronation Gulf in the Arctic, built an extensive plateau about 1200 million years ago with an area of about 170000 km2, representing a volume <b>of</b> <b>lavas</b> <b>of</b> at least [...] The lavas {{are thought to have}} originated from a mantle plume center called the Mackenzie hotspot.|$|R

5000|$|Except for the {{lowermost}} lava flows, {{which contain}} evidence of interaction with water, the entire sequence was erupted subaerially.

5|$|Ciomadul {{has been}} active for over half a million years, with the oldest {{activity}} between 1,000,000 and 750,000 years ago forming lava domes. Older estimates indicate that activity did not start before 250,000 years ago, while more recent research indicated a start of volcanism over 600,000 years ago. Volcanism at Ciomadul consisted mostly of the extrusion <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> domes, their collapse forming block-and-ash flows and subplinian and Vulcanian eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Derrickson {{was fascinated}} by color schemes. He chose blue-green and orange as the primary colors for The Day the Earth Stood Still. The missile silo {{converted}} by the military for experimenting on Gort emphasized gray and orange, which was inspired by an image <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> flowing through a gray field. Derrickson opted to shoot on traditional film, and rendered the colors in post-production {{to make them more}} subtle, for realism.|$|E
5|$|Isolated ridges <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> and {{hydrothermally}} altered rock, {{especially in}} the area of Sherman Crater, are exposed between glaciers on the upper flanks of the volcano; the lower flanks are steep and heavily vegetated. Volcanic rocks of Mount Baker and Black Buttes rest on a foundation of non-volcanic rocks.|$|E
5000|$|The Coppermine River Group {{was formed}} when vast volumes <b>of</b> basaltic <b>lava</b> paved {{over a large}} area of the northwestern Canadian Shield about 1,267 million years ago. These basalts form flood basalts that reach {{thicknesses}} ranging from 2000 m to 3500 m and consists <b>of</b> about 150 <b>lava</b> flows, each about 10-25 m thick. Except for the lowermost flows, which contain evidence of interaction with water, the entire sequence was erupted subaerially. Eruption <b>of</b> plateau <b>lavas</b> near the Coppermine River, built an extensive volcanic plateau about 1,200 million years ago with an area of about 170000 km2 representing a volume <b>of</b> <b>lavas</b> <b>of</b> at least [...] These flood basalts have been interpreted as contemporaneous with the giant Mackenzie dike swarm and with the Muskox intrusion.|$|R

50|$|Rivano and {{co-workers}} define two sub-units of the formation: a lower member {{made up of}} rather fresh rhyolitic ignimbrite and tuff, and an upper member made up <b>of</b> <b>lavas</b> <b>of</b> basaltic and andesitic composition. The volcanic rocks of Farellones Formation have mostly a calc-alkaline character contrasting with the mostly tholeiitic Abanico Formation.|$|R
5|$|Lemmings {{is divided}} {{into a number of}} levels, grouped into four {{difficulty}} categories. Each level begins with one or more trap doors opening from above, releasing a steady line of lemmings who all follow each other.

5|$|Observations of Io by {{spacecraft}} and Earth-based {{astronomers have}} led to the identification of differences in the types of eruptions seen on the satellite. The three main types identified include intra-patera, flow-dominated, and explosion-dominated eruptions.

5|$|On December 19, 2006, a {{large white}} plume of {{condensing}} steam was observed, leading some media people to assume {{there had been a}} small eruption. However, the Cascades Volcano Observatory of the USGS did not mention any significant ash plume. The volcano was in continuous eruption from October 2004, but this eruption consisted in large part of a gradual extrusion <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> forming a dome in the crater.|$|E
30|$|The results {{indicated}} dominantly vertical magma movements around the central {{parts of the}} Wai’anae volcano. This caused inflation in {{this portion of the}} volcano. This process of dike emplacement in the Wai’anae volcano is one of the endogenetic factors that has greatly contributed to the collapse of the edifice. Other factors that could have contributed to this collapse of the volcano are (Keating and McGuire 2000): rapid accumulation <b>of</b> <b>lavas,</b> high angle <b>of</b> repose of the flanks of the volcano causing a lack of stability in the pile <b>of</b> <b>lavas,</b> unstable foundation, thermal alteration, edifice pore pressure, un-buttressed structure; and buried faults.|$|R
40|$|The {{rheological}} properties <b>of</b> <b>lavas</b> erupted {{on the east}} rift zone eruption on Kilauea, Hawaii during September, 1994 have been measured using a new field rotating shear vane viscometer. The viscosities are lower than any previous field measurements on basalts, and the lowest measured viscosity is compatible with laboratory measurements on bubble-free tholeiites from Makaopuhi lava lake at similar temperatures. The higher measured apparent viscosities of some <b>of</b> the <b>lavas</b> and their departure from Newtonian behaviour are attributed to the high vesicularities <b>of</b> these <b>lavas.</b> Differences in measured surface cooling rates are also attributed to differences in vesicularity...|$|R
30|$|The drain-back rate <b>of</b> the <b>lava</b> {{that filled}} the crater was {{estimated}} to be 200 – 105 m 3 / 100 days which corresponds to less than 1 vol.% of the total amount <b>of</b> em-placed <b>lava</b> in the crater, suggesting that large increase <b>of</b> the andesitic <b>lava’s</b> viscosity may have prevented it from draining back.|$|R

5|$|Subduction of the Nazca Plate {{beneath the}} South America plate is {{responsible}} for most of the volcanism in the Central Volcanic Zone. After activity in the western Maricunga Belt volcanic arc ceased six million years ago, volcanism started up in the Incapillo region, forming the high volcanoes Monte Pissis, Cerro Bonete Chico and Sierra de Veladero. Later, a number <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> domes formed between these volcanoes.|$|E
5|$|The Purulla/El Médano ignimbrites have a precaldera {{lower layer}} that various methods have dated 20,000 to 5,000 years ago. This stage was effusive and {{accompanied}} by the emplacement <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> domes. A postcaldera stage is represented by lava domes on the southeast edge of the caldera, as well as block and ash flows inside the caldera. These are rhyolitic in composition.
