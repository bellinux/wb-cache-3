5|$|Supporters of the {{original}} doctrine of privity {{say that it is}} reasonable not to allow third parties to enforce contracts, arguing that to allow them to do so would hamper the rights of {{the original}} parties in relation to amending or terminating contracts. Another argument put forward is that the doctrine was deliberately retained by judges to protect consumers from exclusion clauses designed to protect third party manufacturers from liability. The general view <b>of</b> <b>academics,</b> however, is that no legal argument has yet been advanced as to why the original doctrine should be good law. Patrick Atiyah argues that the doctrine came from a time of rising trade through middlemen, and was designed to simplify commercial transactions and encourage enterprise liability.|$|E

5|$|The {{requirements}} for admission differ between students from Ontario, other provinces in Canada, and international students {{due to the lack}} of uniformity in marking schemes. In 2016, 44 percent of applications to full-time, first-year studies were accepted. In 2013, the secondary school average for full-time first-year students at Queen's was 89% overall, with the Commerce, Education and Engineering faculties having the highest entrance averages at 91.7%, 90.8%, and 90.6% respectively. The application process emphasizes the mandatory Personal Statement of Experience (PSE). The statement expresses how the applicant's personal experiences may contribute to the university. It focuses on qualifications and involvement outside <b>of</b> <b>academics</b> and is an important factor in determining admission. Several faculties require applicants to submit a supplementary essay.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary jury {{consultants}} {{are often}} sociologists, people {{with experience in}} communications and marketing, or attorneys themselves, but they are most frequently psychologists and specialize in legal psychology. Although most of the practice's roots are in criminal trials, modern jury consultants are more often involved in torts (civil litigation), particularly where wealthy corporate defendants fear an enormous monetary judgment for the plaintiff, or where plaintiffs’ attorneys have invested {{large sums of money}} in an important lawsuit. Since the 1980s, large jury consulting and trial consulting firms have sprouted up with multi-million dollar incomes, mostly from such high-stakes civil litigation. The simultaneous shift from ad-hoc groups <b>of</b> <b>academics</b> to a business model has sparked the criticism that SJS magnifies the distorting effect money has on trials, since only the wealthy can afford it. Jury consultants argue that they operate in an adversarial process the same way lawyers do; by pursuing their clients' interests in a rule-bound framework. Jeffrey Abramson, who has written extensively about juries, argues that even if SJS is ethical or has zero effect, the mere myth of powerful, effective jury manipulators shakes public confidence in the jury system.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to assess the factors that {{influence}} biology teacher candidates’ levels <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> self-efficacy. This study, in which the descriptive model was used, was carried out with the participation of 155 biology teacher candidates.

It was determined in the study that the biology teacher candidates’ levels <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> self-efficacy are above the medium level, and a statistically significant difference exists between the levels <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> self-efficacy according to gender in favour of the male teacher candidates. In addition, a statistically significant difference was found between the levels <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> self-efficacy and grade levels; the level <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> self-efficacy increases as the grade level increases.

5|$|On 1 July 1958, {{responding}} to Eisenhower's call, the nuclear powers convened the Conference of Experts in Geneva, aimed at studying means of detecting nuclear tests. The conference included {{scientists from the}} US, Britain, the Soviet Union, Canada, Czechoslovakia, France, Poland, and Romania. The US delegation was led by James Fisk, a member of PSAC, the Soviets by Evgenii Fedorov, and the British delegation by William Penney, who had led the British delegation to the Manhattan Project. Whereas the US approached the conference solely from a technical perspective, Penney was specifically instructed by Macmillan to attempt to achieve a political agreement. This difference in approach {{was reflected in the}} broader composition of the US and UK teams. US experts were primarily drawn from academia and industry. Fisk was a vice president at Bell Telephone Laboratories and was joined by Robert Bacher and Ernest Lawrence, both physicists who had worked on the Manhattan Project. Conversely, British delegates largely held government positions. The Soviet delegation was composed primarily <b>of</b> <b>academics,</b> though virtually all of them had some link to the Soviet government. The Soviets shared the British goal of achieving an agreement at the conference.|$|E

When Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933, Szilard urged {{his family and friends}} to flee Europe while they still could. He moved to England, and transferred his savings of £1,595 (£ today) from his bank in Zurich to one in London. He lived in hotels where lodging and meals cost about £5/5 a week. For those less fortunate, he helped found the Academic Assistance Council, an organization dedicated to helping refugee scholars find new jobs, and persuaded the Royal Society to provide accommodation for it at Burlington House. He enlisted the help <b>of</b> <b>academics</b> such as Harald Bohr, G. H. Hardy, Archibald Hill and Frederick G. Donnan. By the outbreak of World War II in 1939, it had helped to find places for over 2,500 refugee scholars.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} and use of the term Wicca within contemporary Paganism has been a recurring topic of discussion in the field of Pagan studies. The majority <b>of</b> <b>academics</b> and independent scholars use the first, more inclusive definition. Given its historical status and prevalent usage within Paganism, Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White thought it the logical and easier choice for academia, although there is still some disagreement and confusion among researchers as to what defines Wicca. Among those who have used the former definition are American sociologist Margot Adler, literary scholar Chas S. Clifton, and religious studies scholar Aidan A. Kelly, while others such as the Britons Graham Harvey and Ronald Hutton failed to make their usage clear. To deal with this problem in future, Doyle White urged scholars to specify which definition they used in their work.|$|E

25|$|New {{kinds of}} technology, {{including}} social media have {{also played a}} role.

50|$|The last reason, {{and also}} the most {{important}} factor affecting the development <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> discourse is the spread of English.

Moreover, “the global status of English has come to influence both the lives of scholars throughout the globe and the production and exchange <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> knowledge in the twenty-first century.” As a result, the learning <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> discourse is especially meaningful for second language learners.|$|R

40|$|Teaching, {{research}} and service {{are the three}} conventional elements <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> practice, recognised on an international basis.
