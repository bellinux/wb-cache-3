5|$|Covenant {{theology}} is an interpretive framework used by Reformed theologians which was significantly {{developed during the}} seventeenth century. Under this scheme, as articulated by the Assembly, God's dealings with men are {{described in terms of}} two covenants: the covenant of works and covenant <b>of</b> <b>grace.</b> The Westminster Confession was the first major Reformed symbol to explicitly mention the covenant of works (sometimes called the covenant of life), in which God offered Adam eternal life on condition of perfect obedience. In the fall of man, Adam broke the covenant of works by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. To remedy this, God offered salvation apart from human initiative in what was called the covenant <b>of</b> <b>grace.</b> This covenant allowed man to enjoy eternal life despite his inability to obey God's law perfectly. The idea of the covenant <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> was a much more common feature of orthodox Reformed theology. The Westminster divines set these two covenants against each other as the two major ways in which God deals with people.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his honours in Britain, Brooke-Little also served as Chancellor of the British Association of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta from 1973 to 1977. He was first admitted to the Order as a Knight of Magistral Grace, and would eventually hold the rank of Knight Grand Cross <b>of</b> <b>Grace</b> and Devotion. He was also honoured with the Order of Merito Melitense in 1964 and was made a Knight Grand Cross <b>of</b> <b>Grace</b> of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George. In {{addition to}} these honours, he held the Cruz Distinguida (1st class) de San Raimundo de Penafort.|$|E
5|$|After the English Reformation, the North saw several Catholic uprisings, {{including}} the Lincolnshire Rising, Bigod's Rebellion in Cumberland and Westmorland, and largest of all, the Yorkshire-based Pilgrimage <b>of</b> <b>Grace,</b> all against Henry VIII. His daughter Elizabeth I faced another Catholic rebellion, the Rising of the North. The region {{would become the}} centre of recusancy as prominent Catholic families in Cumbria, Lancashire and Yorkshire refused to convert to Protestantism. Royal power over the region was exercised through the Council of the North at King's Manor, York, {{which was founded in}} 1484 by Richard III. The Council existed intermittently for the next two centuries – its final incarnation was created {{in the aftermath of the}} Pilgrimage <b>of</b> <b>Grace</b> and was chiefly an institution for providing order and dispensing justice.|$|E

5|$|Grace {{produced}} moderate {{amounts of}} rainfall along its path, peaking in southern Texas. The storm later merged {{with a cold}} front, which later dropped heavy rainfall in the Mid-West United States. In addition to {{its impact on the}} United States, the outer rainbands <b>of</b> <b>Grace</b> caused light rainfall in Yucatán and northern Tamaulipas.|$|E
5|$|Henry Clifford lived until 1523. Under {{him and his}} son– {{also called}} Henry, who later became Earl of Cumberland– the castle was {{intermittently}} in use as a residence for the family. After Brough Castle was destroyed in a fire in 1521 {{it is likely that}} Brougham became the new administrative centre and focus of the local lordship. As Earl of Cumberland Henry controlled Penrith and Carlisle, although he was an unpopular landlord. When the north of England rose up in the Pilgrimage <b>of</b> <b>Grace</b> in 1536, Henry was one of those targeted by the rebels. He confronted the rebel leaders at Kirkby Stephen in February 1537, and after his defeat he retreated to Brougham Castle. After the Pilgrimage <b>of</b> <b>Grace</b> was suppressed, there were reforms of regional government in the north west. One of the results was that the title of Earl of Cumberland no longer gave Clifford wardenship of Penrith and Carlisle, with Brougham Castle once again becoming the Cliffords' northern-most castle.|$|E
5|$|His later {{writings}} show {{no change}} in his fundamental positions. Other elements in Zwingli's theology would lead him to deny that baptism is a means <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> or {{that it is necessary}} for salvation. His defence of infant baptism was not only a matter of church politics, but was clearly related to the whole of his theology and his profound sense of unity of the church.|$|E

5|$|In Missouri, {{the cold}} front {{combined}} with {{moisture from the}} remnants <b>of</b> <b>Grace</b> brought temporary relief to a severe drought by producing light to moderate rainfall of up to 5inches (127mm) in the southeastern portion of the state. In Poplar Bluff, the rainfall caused severe flooding, resulting in rescues for people in trapped vehicles. The moisture produced over 5inches (127mm) in northern Kentucky, as well.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century, {{the site}} {{was used as a}} beacon for the Pilgrimage <b>of</b> <b>Grace.</b> During the 18th century, the castle was of {{interest}} to treasure hunters following rumours that gold and silver had been discovered at Buckton. The site was used as an anti-aircraft decoy site in the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Percy died at Wressle in 1527 and was {{succeeded by}} his son, Henry Algernon Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland. The Pilgrimage <b>of</b> <b>Grace</b> {{was a popular}} revolt against the rule of Henry VIII in 1536 partly in {{response}} to the dissolution of the monasteries. The rebels in Yorkshire were led by Robert Aske and in October he sought the support of the Percy family. Aske travelled to Wressle Castle and tried to persuade Henry Algernon Percy, who at the time was suffering from illness, to join the rebellion. Though initially opposed to Aske, Percy eventually gave him control of Wressle Castle. Percy had fallen out with his younger brothers, and when he died in 1537 his one surviving brother did not inherit because he was imprisoned {{for his role in the}} Pilgrimage <b>of</b> <b>Grace.</b> In 1537, the crown again resumed control of Wressle Castle, and Henry VIII visited for three nights in 1541.|$|E
25|$|Puerto Rico {{was largely}} undeveloped until 1830, when {{immigrants}} from the Spanish provinces of Catalonia, Majorca, and the Canary Islands began to arrive. They gradually developed the sugarcane, coffee, and tobacco plantations, based {{on the use of}} African slave labor. Spain had approved Decree <b>of</b> <b>Graces</b> <b>of</b> 8 September 1777 in regard to Venezuela, and the Decree <b>of</b> <b>Graces</b> <b>of</b> 1789, which granted its subjects the right to purchase slaves and to participate in the flourishing business of slave trading in the Caribbean.|$|R
500|$|Tales <b>of</b> <b>Graces</b> sold 113,000 copies on {{its initial}} launch date, and sales reached 216,000 within its first year. The game was re-released under the Nintendo Selects label on March 24, 2011. Famitsu praised {{the depth of}} the {{gameplay}} but criticized the loading time. The game was listed on Famitsu's [...] "Greatest Games of All-Time" [...] in 2010. Tales <b>of</b> <b>Graces</b> f sold over 200,000 copies in Japan during its first week and reached over 300,000 a year later. Tales <b>of</b> <b>Graces</b> f was later re-released under PlayStation 3 The Best label on August 2, 2012. Famitsu repeated their praise of the gameplay and lauded the graphical upgrades. A survey by ASCII Media Works's Dengeki Online in 2011 revealed Tales <b>of</b> <b>Graces</b> is ranked seventh on games readers would want to be adapted into an anime.|$|R

5|$|The overall {{appearance}} of the Saluki is one <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> and symmetry. Two coat types—smooth and feathered—are evident in the breed's gene pool.

5|$|The {{remnants}} <b>of</b> <b>Grace</b> dropped {{moderate to}} heavy rainfall eastward through the Mid-Atlantic States and New England. Locations in extreme western Maryland and southeastern Virginia received over 5inches (127mm) of rain. In Maryland, Hagerstown recorded 3.94inches (100mm), resulting in flash flooding. In Washington County, the system produced 1.09inches (27.8mm) of rain, a new daily record. Damage in Maryland, if any, was unknown.|$|E
5|$|Although officially {{designated}} a tropical cyclone by the NHC, Météo-France, the French meteorological service, stated in their annual {{report to the}} World Meteorological Organization that Grace {{should not have been}} classified a tropical system. In their report, they argued that although the storm presented deep convection, an eye-like feature, and winds above 60mph (95km/h), the overall development <b>of</b> <b>Grace</b> was more similar to that of a mid-latitude non-tropical cyclone. However, operationally, Météo-France considered Grace to be a subtropical cyclone. They also criticized the NHC of warning upon this system based on recent trends of the link between global warming and increased hurricane activity.|$|E

During the ten-week period <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> before the princess has to be sacrificed, messengers are despatched to every corner of the realm offering the kingdom, marriage to the princess, and the magic sword the king had inherited from the god Odin.|$|E
5|$|Chiswick's Roman Catholic church, Our Lady <b>of</b> <b>Grace</b> and St Edward (the Confessor) in the Diocese of Westminster, lies on {{the corner}} of Dukes Avenue and the High Road. It is a red brick building; the parish was founded in 1848, a school began c. 1855, and a church was opened by Cardinal Wiseman on the present site in 1864. It was {{replaced}} by the present building in 1886, opened by Cardinal Manning. The heavy debts incurred were paid off and the church consecrated in 1904. The square tower was added after the First World War by Canon Egan as a war memorial.|$|E
