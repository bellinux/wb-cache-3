50|$|An <b>off-premises</b> <b>extension,</b> where {{a worker}} at a remote {{location}} employs a telephone configured {{to appear as}} if it were an extension located at the main business site, may be created in analog telephony by using a leased line to connect the extension to the main enterprise system. Voice over IP makes the creation of off-premises extensions inexpensive and trivial as broadband Internet and virtual private networking can extend local network access anywhere in the world. In either system, an <b>off-premises</b> <b>extension</b> is reachable from within the same enterprise simply by calling its extension number directly; for inbound and outgoing calls, it functions {{as if it were}} located at the main place of business.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>off-premises</b> <b>extension</b> (OPX), {{sometimes}} {{also known}} as off-premises station (OPS), is an extension telephone at a location distant from its servicing private branch exchange (PBX). An off-line extension is generally used to provide employees with access to a company phone system while {{they are out of}} the office.|$|E
50|$|In Internet telephony, a VoIP VPN OPX may be {{implemented}} by connecting an extension over a virtual private networking connection, instead of connecting it {{directly to the}} local area network. As the VPN already appears virtually {{to be part of}} the local area network, the <b>off-premises</b> <b>extension</b> appears to the IP-PBX as if it were on-site.|$|E
5000|$|Servers {{supporting}} inbound sip: {{connections are}} routinely targeted with unauthorised REGISTER attempts with random numeric usernames and passwords, a {{brute force attack}} intended to impersonate individual <b>off-premises</b> <b>extensions</b> on the local PBX ...|$|R
5000|$|A similar scheme {{involves}} forwarding {{an individual}} PBX extension to a long-distance or overseas number; the PBX owner must pay tolls {{for all of}} these calls. Voice over IP servers are often flooded with brute-force attempts to register bogus <b>off-premises</b> <b>extensions</b> (which may then be forwarded or used to make calls) or to directly call SIP addresses which request outside numbers on a gateway; as they are computers, they are targets for Internet system crackers.|$|R
50|$|IP {{communication}} {{provides for}} device mobility. For example, a residential broadband connection {{may be used}} as a link to a virtual private network of a corporate entity, in which case the IP address being used for customer communications may belong to the enterprise, not being the IP address of the residential ISP. Such <b>off-premises</b> <b>extensions</b> may appear as part of an upstream IP PBX. On mobile devices, e.g., a 3G handset or USB wireless broadband adapter, the IP address has no relationship with any physical location known to the telephony service provider, since a mobile user could be anywhere in a region with network coverage, even roaming via another cellular company.|$|R
50|$|Installing an {{extension}} on a VPN {{is a simple}} means to obtain an <b>off-premises</b> <b>extension</b> (OPX), a function which in conventional landline telephony required a leased line from the private branch exchange to the remote site. A worker at a remote location could therefore appear virtually {{to be at the}} company's main office, with full internal access to telephone and network.|$|E
