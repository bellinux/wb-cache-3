5|$|A {{fighter pilot}} based at Andrews Air Force Base, Billy Hutchison, claims that {{while in the}} air he spotted Flight 93 on his scope and planned to first fire his {{training}} rounds into the engine and cockpit, and then ram the airplane with his own jet. His account was published in Lynn Spencer's book Touching History. John Farmer, Senior Counsel to the 9/11 commission, pointed out that this account would have been impossible, as Hutchison's Air Andrews Squadron {{was not in the}} air until 10:38, almost 30 minutes after Flight 93 had crashed. When the 9/11 commission asked Hutchison why he gave this false claim he stormed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> refused to give an answer.|$|E
5|$|Gordon {{arrives at}} the {{building}} where Rachel perished, at which point Dent judges his fate, along with his own and Batman's, with three separate coin flips. He shoots Batman, spares himself, and threatens to kill Gordon's son, claiming that Gordon's negligence caused his family to die. Before he can, Batman, who was wearing body armor, tackles Dent off the building to his death. Batman persuades Gordon to preserve Dent's heroic image by holding Batman responsible for the killing spree. As the police launch a manhunt for Batman, Gordon destroys the Bat-signal, Fox watches as the sonar device self-destructs and walks <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> Alfred Pennyworth burns a letter from Rachel about her choice to marry Dent.|$|E
5|$|Later, Mulder discovers Harold {{in a room}} {{accessible}} {{from the}} bowling alley. The walls of the room are covered with score sheets, {{including those of the}} victims. Mulder realizes that Harold met each of the murdered women at the bowling alley. Harold lapses into a strange seizure, and from his point of view, sees Angie's ghost standing behind Mulder. He rushes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> makes his way to the bowling alley, where Angie lies dead from a heart attack. Mulder tells Scully that every person who saw the apparitions was about to die, implying that Harold may be next. Scully, who also saw a victim's ghost, is struck by the implication.|$|E

5|$|The boy Jones was an {{intruder}} who gained {{entry to the}} palace on three occasions between 1838 and 1841. At least 12 people have managed to gain unauthorised entry into the palace or its grounds since 1914, including Michael Fagan, who broke into the palace twice in 1982 and entered the Queen's bedroom on the second occasion. At the time, news media {{reported that he had}} a long conversation with the Queen while she waited for security officers to arrive, but in a 2012 interview with The Independent, Fagan said the Queen ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> no conversation took place. It was only in 2007 that trespassing on the palace grounds became a specific criminal offence.|$|E
5|$|Hal {{is riding}} {{the school bus}} home one day when he is {{approached}} by Ginny Ryerson, the articulate, competitive star of the debate team. She urges him to join her and replace her former partner, Ben Wekselbaum, who has {{dropped out of high}} school after falling silent mid-speech and losing the New Jersey State High School Policy Debate Championship. Though Hal initially declines, he finds himself besotted with Ginny and agrees to be her partner. Hal and Ginny begin to study for the upcoming tournament and form arguments on either side of whether the federal government should support the teaching of sexual abstinence in public schools. When Hal finds himself unable to talk during a practice debate, he runs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> hides in the janitorial closet, where Ginny joins him. Hal kisses her hopefully, and they make out, but she subsequently falls out of contact with him. Ginny's parents assure him that she is confident with the work they have already completed and that she will meet him on the day of the debate.|$|E
5|$|Everyone sits in silence, {{waiting for}} Parsons's manager to arrive. Jan {{suggests}} that Graham blow up another balloon for Tamsin. Sally, Si and Graham realise that, {{with the camera}} footage they have, they can blow up all the purple balloons and sell them to multiple bidders. Jan screams when she sees movement in Tamsin's bedroom, and it is realised that Frankie is still alive. Jan takes Tamsin <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> the remaining three agree, after panicked discussion, that they should kill Frankie. Si loses a coin toss and smothers Frankie with a cushion. Later, out on the street, Frankie's body is put into an ambulance. Si says to Sally and Graham {{that he will be}} in touch and leaves. Sally and Graham discuss selling the camcorder footage, and Jan runs inside to see that Tamsin is not in her chair or room. Upstairs, Tamsin crawls onto the bed containing the balloon, carrying a heart-shaped helium balloon. On the street, Sally, Graham and Jan see Tamsin opening the upstairs window. She releases the helium balloon with the balloon containing Frankie's breath attached. The two float skyward as Graham films.|$|E

5|$|Ben and Abi {{continue}} their relationship, but Ben is still secretly seeing Paul. Babe Smith (Annette Badland) offers Abi {{work in the}} pub kitchen, and Abi tells Babe that {{she is able to}} {{turn a blind eye to}} Ben's homosexuality as long as he loves her. However, when Abi finds a present that Ben has got for Paul, she realises he has feelings for Paul and confides in Babe, who helps her to publicly announce that she is pregnant. Ben asks Abi to have a termination but then changes his mind, saying he wants the baby. Abi then goes to Babe, panicking because she has lied and is not really pregnant. When Ben accompanies her to a doctor's appointment, she gets him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> confesses her lie to the doctor, who encourages her to be honest, but she then tells Ben the baby is due in October. Abi plans to get pregnant by Ben, but when he admits he may have caught an STI from a stranger, she is unable to have sex with him, so Babe tells her to get pregnant by another man. Babe forces her into getting drunk, and after a drunk Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) compliments her, they have unprotected sex. However, Abi does not get pregnant. She decides to tell Ben the truth, but as she is about to do so, he tells her he has caught chlamydia. Abi later tests positive for chlamydia and realises that Lee may have caught it too. Abi panics to Babe that Ben will discover she is not pregnant, so during an argument between Ben and Phil, Babe pushes Abi into Ben as he is pushed by Phil, knocking her to the ground. Babe takes Abi away from the square, and on their return, Abi tells Ben she has had a miscarriage. When she later sees Ben being comforted by Paul, she feels uneasy.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{continued}} to the pedestrian gate where he stabbed the officer controlling the gate, and two officers {{who had just}} entered the prison. This incident was seen by a soldier on duty in a watch tower, who reported to the British Army operations room {{that he had seen}} prison officers fighting. The operations room telephoned the prison's Emergency Control Room (ECR), which replied that everything was all right and that an alarm had been accidentally triggered earlier. At 4:12 pm the alarm was raised when an officer in the gatehouse pushed the prisoner holding him hostage <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> telephoned the ECR. However, this was not done soon enough to prevent the escape. After several attempts the prisoners had opened the main gate, and were waiting for the prisoners still in the gatehouse to rejoin them in the lorry. At this time two prison officers blocked the exit with their cars, forcing the prisoners to abandon the lorry and {{make their way to the}} outer fence which was 25 yards away. Four prisoners attacked one of the officers and hijacked his car, which they drove towards the external gate. They crashed into a car near the gate and abandoned the car. Two escaped through the gate, one was captured exiting the car, and another was captured after being chased by a soldier. At the main gate, a prison officer was shot in the leg while chasing the only two prisoners who had not yet reached the outer fence. The prisoner who fired the shot was captured after being shot and wounded by a soldier in a watch tower, and the other prisoner was captured after falling. The other prisoners escaped over the fence, and by 4:18 pm the main gate was closed and the prison secured, after 35 prisoners had breached the prison perimeter. The escape was the biggest in both British and Irish history, and the biggest in Europe since World War II.|$|E

Hearing about the escape, Scully and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) investigate. They learn that three men escaped from three prisons, {{all of whom had}} contact with a prison chaplain named Reverend Orison (Scott Wilson). Eventually, the US Marshals corner Pfaster and Orison at a diner, but Orison uses his power of persuasion to distract the Marshals, allowing the two to escape. Pfaster takes Orison's car and runs him over. Meanwhile, Scully keeps hearing the song [...] "Don't Look Any Further" [...] everywhere she goes, soon believing it is a sign. The agents find and question Orison, who is himself an ex-convict and claims that he is doing the work of God.|$|E

Later still, the flat is a mess, and Tom is unkempt and drinking heavily. He has no messages on his phone and no post. He sits down to play Scrabble with Migg, and it is revealed that it is Tom's birthday. The two argue about washing up, and Migg says that Tom has [...] "no right" [...] to judge him.

500|$|The theme, [...] "The X-Files", {{used more}} {{instrumental}} sections than most dramas. The theme song's famous whistle effect {{was inspired by}} the track [...] "How Soon Is Now?" [...] from The Smiths' 1985 album Meat Is Murder. After attempting to craft the theme with different sound effects, Snow used a Proteus 2 rack-mount synth with an effect called [...] "Whistling Joe". After hearing this effect, Carter was [...] "taken aback" [...] and noted it was [...] "going to be good". According to the [...] "Behind the Truth" [...] segment on the first season DVD, Snow created the echo effect on the track by accident. He felt that after several revisions, something still was not right. Carter walked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> Snow put his hand and forearm on his keyboard in frustration. By doing so, he accidentally activated an echo effect setting. The resulting riff pleased Carter; Snow said, [...] "this sound was in the keyboard. And that was it." [...] The second episode, [...] "Deep Throat", marked Snow's debut as solo composer for an entire episode. The production crew was determined to limit the music in the early episodes. Likewise, the theme song itself first appeared in [...] "Deep Throat".|$|E

I wasn't on anybody's lists. The funny thing was, I think they went to Thomas Jane for it, and they were told that Thomas Jane does not do television." [...] Hamm went through seven auditions; his last one took place at the Hotel Gansevoort in the Meatpacking District of New York City. [...] "When we were riding down on the elevator, the woman in charge of whatever the decision-making process was told me, 'You got the job.'" ...|$|E

A narrator mentions that Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein near the couples house in Cologny; Shelley is seen in the country writing her book with quill and ink and is joined by Lord Byron and Percy Shelley. An unseen man and woman (Godard and Florence Colombani) paint with watercolors and black ink. They order Roxy <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> (paraphrasing Dostoyevsky's Demons) compare Kirillov's two questions, [...] "a big one and a little one" [...] (the other world and suffering) and the [...] "difficult fit flatness into depth" [...] to the act of creating art.

Madonna took the book and walked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> didn't come back until about half an hour later. Suddenly she was on the mic, speaking in this very dry voice. [...] "My name is Dita," [...] she said, [...] "and I'll be your mistress tonight." [...] I knew that the original [...] "Erotica" [...] {{would never be the same}} again, and it wasn't. The chorus and bridge were changed entirely and the whole psyche of the song became sexier, more to the point. It seemed as if Dita brought out the best in her, actually serving as a vehicle for the dangerous territory she was traveling. Actually, it was the same name Madonna used when she'd stay in hotels around the world. Not anymore.|$|E

The story went that the Pantazi Ghica caressed Piţirigă, causing the latter to become indignant and thus reveal his true identity.
