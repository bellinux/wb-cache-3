As a result, {{there was a}} suspicion among a minority that Khánh's junta had been behind the attack, even though the Viet Cong had claimed responsibility through a radio broadcast. When the Americans started making plans to retaliate against North Vietnam, they did not tell Khánh and his junta. Westmoreland, Taylor, and other senior US officers in Saigon and Washington urged President Lyndon Baines Johnson to authorize reprisal bombings against North Vietnam, Taylor predicting: [...] "Some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>local</b> squabbles will probably disappear in enthusiasm which our action would generate." [...] Johnson refused and one reason was the political instability in Saigon. Johnson reasoned {{the international community and}} the American public were unlikely to believe the Viet Cong were behind the attack, feeling they would instead blame local infighting for the violence. Johnson administration officials did not conclude that the communists were responsible until four days after the attack. The State Department cabled Taylor, saying [...] "In view of the overall confusion in Saigon", public US and international opinion towards an American air strike would be that the Johnson administration was [...] "trying to shoot its way out of an internal [...] political crisis".|$|E

2500|$|After {{developing}} [...] "a random obsession" [...] with Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny, {{she took}} the morning off school during her Junior Certificate mock examinations and met the future Taoiseach as he campaigned in Millstreet ahead of the 2011 general election. Their meeting was filmed for television, with Kenny vowing he would not reduce disability funding if elected. O'Riordan later remarked, [...] "I thought he was honest. He looked like someone who wasn't {{going to tell a}} lie." [...] Upon election he cut disability funding and O'Riordan wrote a letter expressing her disappointment. Her public confrontation with Enda Kenny over his spending cuts to disability funding contributed to O'Riordan's rise to fame; the government later changed its mind. She later explained: [...] "I thought Enda Kenny was a cool guy, you know, he always seemed really relaxed, and easy going. So I only went up for a picture and one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>local</b> people from home was like ‘why don't you ask him about people with disabilities’, so I did and the local television were recording because it was a big thing for Millstreet, our Future Taoiseach coming.

[...] The matter was raised and defeated at General Assembly 2012 by Ian Watson, who, following Queen's Cross Church and Scott Rennie's hosting of a local Hindu Association, sought for the General Assembly to ban worship on Christian premises of non-Christian faiths.

40|$|Color poster with text {{describing}} {{research conducted}} by Justin Townsend, advised by Dr. Kelly Cain (University of Wisconsin-River Falls) {{on the idea of}} using locally grown food {{on the campus of the}} University of Wisconsin-River Falls. As The University of Wisconsin River Falls has made the decision to be at the forefront of sustainable community development in the region, it becomes very important to look at all aspects <b>of</b> campus. Since <b>our</b> current food service contractor uses unsustainable practices, I researched the possibilities and benefits <b>of</b> using <b>our</b> <b>local</b> food stocks. My research was primarily looking at hidden costs of the food we eat here on campus based on previous research done by ecologists and economists. I also studied the feasibility <b>of</b> using <b>our</b> <b>local</b> food stock by using other universities, <b>local</b> programs, and <b>our</b> current use <b>of</b> <b>local</b> products. What I discovered was two important facts about our food services on campus. First, it was not sustainable and promoted a system that harmed <b>our</b> <b>local</b> economy, <b>our</b> neighbors, and the environment around the globe. Secondly, I found if we made a few changes in procurement our food services could provide a higher degree of freshness and nutrition to River Falls' students and staff. The conclusion I came to is that UW-River Falls should support imposed guidelines that tell our food service how much they must spend in our community...|$|R

60|$|Worthy Sir: In a {{preceding}} communication, I {{have given}} you some brief notice of Wolfert's Roost, the mansion where I first {{had the good fortune}} to become acquainted with the venerable historian of the New Netherlands. As this ancient edifice is likely to be the place whence I shall date many of my lucubrations, and as it is really a very remarkable little pile, intimately connected with all the great epochs <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>local</b> and national history, I have thought it but right to give some farther particulars concerning it. Fortunately, in rummaging a ponderous Dutch chest of drawers, which serves as the archives of the Roost, and in which are preserved many inedited manuscripts of Mr. KNICKERBOCKER, together with the precious records of New-Amsterdam, brought hither by Wolfert Acker at the downfall of the Dutch dynasty, as has been already mentioned, I found in one corner, among dried pumpkin-seeds, bunches of thyme, and pennyroyal, and crumbs of new-year cakes, a manuscript, carefully wrapped up in the fragment of an old parchment deed, but much blotted, and the ink grown foxy by time, which, on inspection, I discovered to be a faithful chronicle of the Roost. The hand-writing, and certain internal evidences, leave no doubt in my mind, that it is a genuine production of the venerable historian of the New-Netherlands, written, very probably, during his residence at the Roost, in gratitude for the hospitality of its proprietor. As such, I submit it for publication. As the entire chronicle is too long for the pages of your Magazine, and as it contains many minute particulars, which might prove tedious to the general reader, I have abbreviated and occasionally omitted some of its details; but may hereafter furnish them separately, should they seem to be required by the curiosity of an enlightened and document-hunting public. Respectfully yours, GEOFFREY CRAYON.|$|E
60|$|In {{the most}} {{recently}} established <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>local</b> representative institutions, the Boards of Guardians, the justices of {{peace of the}} district sit ex officio along with the elected members, in number limited by law {{to a third of}} the whole. In the peculiar constitution of English society, I have no doubt of the beneficial effect of this provision. It secures the presence in these bodies of a more educated class than it would perhaps be practicable to attract thither on any other terms; and while the limitation in number of the ex officio members precludes them from acquiring predominance by mere numerical strength, they, as a virtual representation of another class, having sometimes a different interest from the rest, are a check upon the class interests of the farmers or petty shopkeepers who form the bulk of the elected guardians. A similar commendation can not be given to the constitution of the only provincial boards we possess, the Quarter Sessions, consisting of the justices of peace alone, on whom, over and above their judicial duties, {{some of the most important}} parts of the administrative business of the country depend for their performance. The mode of formation of these bodies is most anomalous, they being neither elected, nor, in any proper sense of the term, nominated, but holding their important functions, like the feudal lords to whom they succeeded, virtually by right of their acres; the appointment vested in the crown (or, speaking practically, in one of themselves, the lord lieutenant) being made use of only as a means of excluding any one who it is thought would do discredit to the body, or, now and then, one who is on the wrong side in politics. The institution is the most aristocratic in principle which now remains in England; far more so than the House of Lords, for it grants public money and disposes of important public interests, not in conjunction with a popular assembly, but alone. It is clung to with proportionate tenacity by our aristocratic classes, but is obviously at variance with all the principles which are the foundation of representative government. In a County Board there is not the same justification as in Boards of Guardians for even an admixture of ex officio with elected members, since the business of a county being on a sufficiently large scale to be an object of interest and attraction to country gentlemen, they would have no more difficulty in getting themselves elected to the Board than they have in being returned to Parliament as county members.|$|E
