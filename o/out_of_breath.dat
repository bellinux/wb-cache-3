5|$|Truce {{terms are}} {{recorded}} {{as having been}} used in the following circumstances; being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> having a stitch, a shoelace being undone, fear of clothes being damaged, needing to go to the lavatory, checking the time, wanting to discuss or clarify rules during a fight or game, or one combatant wanting to remove their spectacles or jacket before continuing. It does not mean to surrender, although it may sometimes be used in preparation to surrendering. Truce terms are only used within a specific age group, have little currency outside that group and are by and large abandoned by the age of 10 or 11 years. However, research into early recorded use of these terms found examples of some of these terms being used as a sign of surrender in battle or adult fights or quarrels as late as the 18th century.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} {{technique for}} buddy breathing {{is for the}} divers to alternately breathe from the demand valve, usually each taking two breaths before exchanging the DV, but {{it is common for}} the receiver to be <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath</b> {{at the start of the}} procedure, and they may need a few more breaths to stabilize. Once a rhythm has been established, it is usual to terminate the dive and start the ascent, so buddy breathing training will usually include assisted ascents. Assisted ascents using a secondary demand valve are simpler than buddy breathing ascents, and this skill is quicker to learn.|$|E

In Parallel Lives Plutarch states that Demosthenes built an underground study where he practiced speaking and shaving one half of his head so that he could not go out in public.

50|$|Heart arrhythmia, {{also known}} as cardiac {{dysrhythmia}} or irregular heartbeat, {{is a group of}} conditions in which the heartbeat is irregular, too fast, or too slow. A heart rate that is too fast - above 100 beats per minute in adults - is called tachycardia and a heart rate that is too slow - below 60 beats per minute - is called bradycardia. Many types of arrhythmia have no symptoms. When symptoms are present these may include palpitations or feeling a pause between heartbeats. More seriously there may be lightheadedness, passing <b>out,</b> shortness <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> or chest pain. While most types of arrhythmia are not serious, some predispose a person to complications such as stroke or heart failure. Others may result in cardiac arrest.|$|R

Realising the {{futility}} of turning back to Wilson without help, they decided to rejoin Forbes anyway, and to that end traversed the swollen river with considerable difficulty. They then rode to where the battle on the southern side was still going on. On reaching the main column shaken and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> Burnham leapt from his horse and ran to Forbes: [...] "I think I may {{say that we are}} the sole survivors of that party," [...] he quietly confided, before loading his rifle and joining the skirmish.|$|E

500|$|Following Turtle’s {{abortive}} {{attack in}} New York Harbor, Bushnell continued {{his work in}} underwater explosives. In 1777, he devised mines to be towed for an attack on HMS Cerberus and to be floated down the Delaware River {{in an attempt to}} interrupt the British fleet off Philadelphia. Both attempts failed, and the latter occupied a brief, if farcical, place in the literature of the war. Francis Hopkinson’s poem “Battle of the Kegs,” captured the surprising, if futile, venture: “The soldier flew, the sailor too, and, scared almost to death, sir, wore out their shoes to spread the news, and ran till <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> sir.” [...] After the war, Bushnell drifted into obscurity. He died largely unknown in Georgia in the mid-1820s. [...] After the war, inventors such as Robert Fulton were influenced by Bushnell’s designs in the development of underwater explosives.|$|E

However, such inspection is cumbersome and may not reflect the true prevalence of PVA as the neural breathing drive is not taken into consideration. Alternatively, electrical activity of the diaphragm measured with a specific nasogastric catheter (EAdi) or the esophageal pressure signal can be used and is in fact more accurate signals for identifying PVA [6 – 11].|$|R

500|$|Filming {{began in}} New York in October 1986. Madonna {{would ask for}} five minutes to study the script for the scene they were filming. For example, before {{a scene in which}} she needed to appear <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> she did a series of push-ups before going on set. Dunne {{observed}} that [...] " [...] likes her first take best. I think my best is around fourth. She always says, 'You got it, you got it,' and she was driving me crazy just like her character would. We had to make a compromise as to which take is the best." [...] Madonna wanted Foley to give her proper direction on set, but he preferred her to be her real self, rather than the persona in her music videos. Regarding her acting abilities, Foley stressed on the fact that Madonna was very uptight and into every detail, determined to have the correct portrayal. [...] "That's probably why it wasn't so good. In Desperately Seeking Susan, when she didn't know what she was doing, she was being natural and at her best." ...|$|E
500|$|Conker's {{abilities}} are far simpler {{than those of}} previous Rare platform games Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. The player can run, jump, and smack enemies with a frying pan. Conker also has a few other physical abilities. He can swim underwater for a while until he runs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> climb ladders or ropes, and {{is strong enough to}} push heavy objects. To regain lost health, Conker can eat pieces of [...] "anti-gravity" [...] Chocolate that are scattered throughout the levels. Additionally, the game employs [...] "context sensitive" [...] pads that allow Conker to gain different, temporary abilities when pressing the [...] "B" [...] button atop them. For instance, {{in the beginning of the}} game, by pressing the B button on the first pad he encounters, Conker drinks some Alka-Seltzer to wipe out his hangover, at which point players can proceed forward. Some pads can turn Conker into an anvil to slam into the ground, and some are also used to pull out his shotgun, to activate his throwing knives, slingshot and so on. They also serve to inform players of what needs to be done next.|$|E
500|$|Deborah Wilker from The Day {{commented that}} [...] "Madonna's got an almost rabid energy about her, which she {{maintains}} {{for the duration}} of 90 minutes. In fact she rarely leaves the stage—preferring to change costumes in a phone booth instead. Boy can she change. One minute she's a 50's teenager in a party dress, next she's playing a speak-easy chanteuse. It's almost difficult to believe that a career as young as Madonna's could contain so much popular material that on stage the star can barely get to half of it." [...] Don McLeese from Chicago Sun-Times reviewed the performance at Soldier Field stadium said that [...] "'Shine' seems like a dim possibility for her Soldier Field performance this month, because Madonna invariably takes the stage after dusk has turned to dark and brings back the sun again for the two hours that she played." [...] In another review, McCleese commented: [...] " [...] proceeded to show Soldier Field a few moves that would gain Walter Payton some yardage, while putting a whole new twist on the term 'backfield in motion'. The girl really knows how to cause a commotion." [...] Richard Harrington from The Washington Post felt that the tour [...] "would have played better to a full house at the Capital Centre or Merriweather Post Pavilion. But to her credit, Madonna performed last night as if the house was full, and the show is splendid pop theater. Madonna has described it as 'Broadway in a stadium', and with her nonstop dancing, costume changes, mini-dramas and dynamic pacing, it is sort of a 'Liza With an M.'" [...] Jon Pareles from The New York Times reviewed the concert at Madison Square Garden in New York and felt that [...] "For all its effort and professionalism, the concert wasn't exactly moving; Madonna had to ask the audience to get up and dance twice. But as shallow, kitschy, pop entertainment—no big messages, no revelations, familiar sounds and images, plenty of catchy tunes—the show was easy to enjoy. [...] The tunes stick to her limited vocal range and usually use short phrases—the better to keep her from running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath</b> as she dances across the stage. And her band knocked the songs out with solid precision, recreating the gleaming sound of her records.|$|E

500|$|Shortness <b>of</b> <b>breath</b> {{is often}} the symptom that most bothers people.

Different terms, however, {{may be used in}} different cultures. Typically the shortness <b>of</b> <b>breath</b> is worse on exertion of a prolonged duration and worsens over time. In the advanced stages, it occurs during rest and may be always present. It is a source of both anxiety and a poor quality of life in those with COPD. Many people with more advanced COPD breathe through pursed lips and this action can improve shortness <b>of</b> <b>breath</b> in some.|$|R
