However, Indonesia {{is not yet a}} full member of the ASEAN <b>open</b> <b>sky</b> <b>agreement,</b> which plans to lift regional flying restrictions throughout Southeast Asia on member country airlines by the end of 2015 or early 2016. Indonesia is considering opening up only five of its international airports under this policy; they are Jakarta, Medan, Bali, Surabaya and Makassar. To date, Indonesia has agreed to open access to Jakarta, yet, Indonesia remains opposed to opening up its secondary cities. Currently Indonesia adopt limitations for foreign airlines to operate in Indonesia. This rather protectionist stance was meant to protect Indonesian aviation business against competitors, particularly from Singapore and Malaysia. Basically, this stance is stemmed from a systematic imbalance between ASEAN nations; as a large nation, Indonesia is able to offer hundreds of access points, while other fellow ASEAN members may offer far less points of access. Singapore for example has only one point of access, while Malaysia may offer two or three access points. This systematic imbalance for exchange of traffic rights has led Indonesian carriers to lobby their government to refrain from entering into multilateral agreement on ASEAN Single Aviation Market.|$|E

50|$|As a large country {{spanning}} {{over three}} timezones, Indonesia possesses a vast airspace. However, Indonesia {{is not a}} participant of the International Air Services Transit Agreement (IASTA), therefore both Indonesian airspace and airports are closed for foreign commercial airlines' freedoms of the air, unless there were bilateral transit agreements negotiated with other countries. Indonesia and Australia for example, signed a bilateral agreement relating to air service on 7 February 2013. According to this agreement, each nations grants to the other party the right to fly across its territory without landing, {{and the right to}} make stops in its territory for non-traffic purposes (1st and 2nd freedom), and the rights for designated airlines to operate services.

In the second part, I have worked on the European Union order, in particular the Liberalisation of aviation transport market and the Regulation 95 / 93 and 793 / 2004. In addition, I have examined the Guernsey case in the United Kingdom. The third part has been focused on competition law, in particular the abuse of dominant position and the Essential Facilities Doctrine, both in the United States and in European Union order. In addition, I have analysed the model of secondary market of slots allocation in European Union order. Finally the fourth part, deals with the external relations of European law in the aviation transport, in particular the <b>Open</b> <b>Sky</b> <b>agreement</b> with the United States.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the long term}} impact of <b>open</b> <b>skies</b> <b>agreements</b> between US and Europe {{from the perspective of}} scheduled passenger flights. Our analysis is based on flight schedule data from the Official Airline Guide and also includes bilateral trade volume data and crude oil prices. We find that the changes in frequency, in total capacity (in terms of number of seats per week) and in inter-city connectivity (in terms of number of cities and city-pairs served) are more complex than the conventional notion of an abrupt, monotonic increase in air transport services between countries that have bilateral <b>open</b> <b>skies</b> <b>agreements</b> compared to those without.
