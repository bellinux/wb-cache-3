5|$|After {{receiving}} Staines's report, the Admiralty {{decided to}} take no action. In the following years, many ships called at Pitcairn Island and heard Adams's various stories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> of the Pitcairn settlement. Adams died in 1829, honoured as the founder and father of a community that became celebrated over the next century as an exemplar of Victorian morality. Over the years, many recovered Bounty artefacts have been sold by islanders as souvenirs; in 1999, the Pitcairn Project was established by a consortium of Australian academic and historical bodies, to survey and document all the material remaining on-site, {{as part of a}} detailed study of the settlement's development.|$|E

Also, 1985 marked the 25th anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> of the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center; and NASA asked Jarre to integrate the anniversary into the concert.|$|E

5|$|In late 1518, {{the post}} of the Leutpriestertum (people's priest) of the Grossmünster at Zurich became vacant. The canons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> that {{administered}} the Grossmünster recognised Zwingli's reputation as a fine preacher and writer. His connection with humanists was a decisive factor as several canons were sympathetic to Erasmian reform. In addition, {{his opposition to the}} French and to mercenary service was welcomed by Zurich politicians. On 11 December 1518, the canons elected Zwingli to become the stipendiary priest and on 27 December he moved permanently to Zurich.|$|E

5|$|Las Casas's legacy {{has been}} highly controversial. In the years {{following}} his death his ideas became taboo in the Spanish realm, and he {{was seen as a}} nearly heretical extremist; the accounts written by his enemies Lopez de Gómara and Oviedo were widely read and published. As the British empire rose to power and hostilities between the British and Spanish began, the British used Las Casas's accounts of Spanish cruelty as a political tool making it part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> of what Spanish nationalists have called the Black Legend, the tendency of historians to slander Spain for its imperial past, while looking mildly at the same undertakings by others such as the British.|$|E
