5|$|After {{several months}} of {{interviews}} while in prison in 2015, Bales revealed in depth his recollection of his actions step by step the night <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders</b> and why he believed he acted {{the way he did}} in an article published in GQ magazine on October 21, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Butchers, slaughterers, surgeons, and {{physicians}} were suspected {{because of the}} manner of the mutilations. A surviving note from Major Henry Smith, Acting Commissioner of the City Police, indicates that the alibis were investigated of local butchers and slaughterers, with the result that they were eliminated from the inquiry. A report from Inspector Swanson to the Home Office confirms that 76 butchers and slaughterers were visited, and that the inquiry encompassed all their employees for the previous six months. Some contemporary figures, including Queen Victoria, thought the pattern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders</b> indicated that the culprit was a butcher or cattle drover on one of the cattle boats that plied between London and mainland Europe. Whitechapel was close to the London Docks, and usually such boats docked on Thursday or Friday and departed on Saturday or Sunday. The cattle boats were examined but the dates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders</b> did not coincide with a single boat's movements and the transfer of a crewman between boats was also ruled out.|$|E
5|$|Leslie Tiller, {{the village}} florist, tells Angel {{she intends to}} sell her shop {{and move to the}} city. While Angel is distracted, Tiller is murdered by a cloaked figure. Angel gives chase but loses the killer. Angel accuses Skinner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders,</b> but his alibi is backed up by video footage. Angel theorises they may be {{multiple}} killers, but Frank shoots down the idea.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> victim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> was 70 {{years of}} age or older; or <b>the</b> victim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> was {{particularly}} vulnerable due to a significant handicap or significant disability, whether mental or physical, and at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>the</b> defendant knew or reasonably should have known of such handicap or disability; ...|$|R
5000|$|The person, {{alone or}} with others, {{subjected}} or attempted to subject <b>the</b> victim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> to nonconsensual sexual penetration immediately before, during or immediately after <b>the</b> commission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder.</b>|$|R
50|$|Medical {{opinions}} differed as to <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poison used in <b>the</b> <b>murders.</b> <b>The</b> jury {{took two}} hours to decide the verdict. They found Castaing innocent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> Hippolyte but guilty of destroying his will and guilty by seven votes to five <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> Auguste.|$|R
5|$|A former {{employee}} of Chandler's {{testified that he}} bragged about dating three women on the bay that night, and that {{the next morning he}} arrived and delivered materials for a job by boat and immediately set out again. In an attempt to establish Chandler's whereabouts on the night <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders,</b> investigators found records of several ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home between 1:00am and 5:00am, which may have been attempts to explain his absence to his wife, and to provide himself with an alibi for the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders.</b> Chandler's daughter, Kristal May Sue, testified that her father had talked about killing three women, and that he was afraid of returning to Tampa. A maid, who worked at the motel where the Rogers women stayed, testified that she walked past Chandler on June 1 as she was heading for the Rogers' room for room service. She said that she did not realize the significance of this sighting until Chandler's arrest in 1992; the sighting has never been confirmed. Michelle's boyfriend and Hal Rogers also took the stand during trial.|$|E
5|$|Albert Victor's intellect, {{sexuality}} {{and mental health}} {{have been the subject}} of speculation. Rumours linked him with the Cleveland Street scandal, which involved a homosexual brothel, but there is no conclusive evidence that he ever went there or was even homosexual. Some authors have argued that he was the serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, but contemporary documents show that Albert Victor could not have been in London at the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders,</b> and the claim is widely dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Both Schlesselman and Cowart {{acknowledged}} {{that they would}} be killed as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders</b> and insisted they were willing to die. Authorities said the pair planned to break into a gun shop to steal more weapons for their attack, and also bought nylon rope and ski masks at Walmart to use in a robbery or home invasion to fund the spree. Schlesselman and Cowart asked a friend to drive them to a house they planned to rob, but they cancelled the robbery after getting scared by a dog and two vehicles in the driveway.|$|E
5000|$|Arnaldo [...] "Naldy" [...] Colón - A {{friend of}} Cacho. It has been rumored {{he was at}} the house <b>the</b> night <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder.</b> On March 9, 2015, on the 5th year anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder,</b> <b>the</b> Puerto Rico Department of Justice {{announced}} that he was no longer a suspect.|$|R
50|$|In 1136 Bishop William <b>of</b> Orkney sanctified <b>the</b> <b>murdered</b> Earl Magnus, {{making him}} Saint Magnus. It is thought {{probable}} that St Magnus Church, Egilsay, was constructed {{on the island}} shortly afterwards, at or near <b>the</b> supposed site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder.</b> This may have replaced an earlier church which could have already been there at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> Magnus.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{high-profile}} nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> case persuades Callahan that {{it could}} vault him to the governor's office if he prosecutes it himself. He personally arrests the prime suspect, Thornwall, a wealthy man with political connections, <b>the</b> husband <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murdered</b> woman.|$|R
5|$|Chandler {{was found}} guilty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders,</b> {{and was sentenced to}} death on November 4, 1994. He {{maintained}} his innocence, and continued to pursue legal appeals while on Florida's Death Row. He admitted to the Madeira Beach incident but said the sex was consensual, and that the victim changed her mind during the act. Since Chandler had already been sentenced to death for the Rogers family murders, and prosecutors did not want to subject Blair to the emotional trauma of a rape trial, he was never prosecuted for Blair's rape.|$|E
5|$|In November 1888, he {{lost his}} post at the school for reasons that remain unclear. One month later his body was {{discovered}} drowned in the River Thames. His death, which {{was found to be}} a suicide, roughly coincided with the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders</b> attributed to Jack the Ripper. Private suggestions in the 1890s that he could have committed the crimes became public knowledge in the 1960s, and led to the publication of books that proposed him as the murderer. The evidence against him was entirely circumstantial, however, and many writers from the 1970s onwards have rejected him as a likely suspect.|$|E
5|$|In November, {{the three}} {{principal}} Bundy investigators—Jerry Thompson from Utah, Robert Keppel from Washington, and Michael Fisher from Colorado—met and exchanged information with 30 detectives and prosecutors from five states in Aspen, Colorado. While officials left the meeting (later {{known as the}} Aspen Summit) convinced that Bundy was the murderer they sought, they agreed that more hard evidence would be needed before he could be charged with any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In November 1998, after {{evidence}} from Bowden and others, Paul [...] "Hippo" [...] Ward was convicted <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> {{and sentenced to}} life in prison as an accomplice, because he had disposed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> weapon and <b>the</b> motorbike. This conviction was later overturned on appeal.|$|R
50|$|He {{was killed}} on <b>the</b> anniversary <b>of</b> two other murders of {{minority}} Tamil journalists in Sri Lanka.

5|$|Martha Wise (1884 – June 28, 1971), born Martha Hasel, was an American poisoner and serial killer. After {{her husband}} died and her family forced her to end a {{relationship}} with a new lover, Wise retaliated by poisoning seventeen family members, of whom three died, in 1924. She was convicted of one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders,</b> despite defense claims that she was mentally ill and that her lover had ordered her to poison her family. The case {{is considered one of the}} most sensational of the era in Ohio, where it occurred.|$|E
5|$|That night, {{the boys}} dig up Isaac's grave and find his body intact. While {{retrieving}} tools from the car, {{one of the}} boys is brutally murdered. The next morning, Mulder and Scully find a book on Jewish mysticism buried with Isaac's body; it mysteriously bursts into flames. On the book is Jacob's name. The agents search for Jacob, finding him in a synagogue with the hanged body of the last remaining boy. Although Jacob admits to both <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders,</b> Mulder believes that a Golem—a creature from Jewish mysticism—is the true murderer.|$|E
5|$|The police {{searched the}} gun {{cupboard}} {{on the day}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders</b> but found nothing. Three days later, on 10 August, Bamber's extended family visited the farm with Basil Cock, the estate's executor. During that visit, one of the cousins, David Boutflour, found the silencer and rifle sights in the gun cupboard. The court heard that this was witnessed by Boutflour's father and sister, {{as well as by}} Basil Cock and the farm secretary.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{junction}} <b>of</b> Golborne Road and Southam Street was <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> Antiguan immigrant Kelso Cochrane in 1959, {{an attack}} {{widely viewed as}} racially motivated. His killers were never caught. In 2009 a blue plaque was erected at <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In November 1998, after {{evidence}} from Bowden and others, Paul [...] "Hippo" [...] Ward was convicted <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> {{and sentenced to}} life in prison as an accomplice, because he had disposed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> weapon and <b>the</b> motorbike.

5|$|An {{estate agent}} {{receives}} a video recording <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders</b> in the post, leaving Black puzzled. That same day, the killer hides in another open house, later murdering {{a woman with}} a shotgun before calling the police to the scene. Black finds an X drawn in blood under the house's welcome mat; Patricia has begun drawing red Xs in her crayon pictures, which Catherine takes notice of. Black reviews the videotape, finding a reflection of the killer in a glass pane. Extracting a picture from this, he requests to show it to Patricia, but stops himself, realizing that the killer let Patricia live so that she could relive the events when questioned.|$|E
5|$|Billy is {{released}} the next day. Suspicion {{has shifted to}} Sidney's father, Neil Prescott, as the calls have been traced to his phone. School is suspended in the wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders.</b> After the students have left the school, Principal Himbry is stabbed to death in his office. Tatum's boyfriend, Stu Macher throws a party to celebrate the school's closure. The party is attended by Sidney, Tatum, their friend Randy Meeks, and multiple other students. Reporter Gale Weathers attends uninvited to cover the situation, as she expects the killer to strike. Tatum's brother deputy sheriff Dewey Riley also looks out for the murderer at the party. Tatum is killed during the party after having her head crushed by the garage door. Billy arrives to speak to Sidney privately, and the two ultimately consummate their relationship. Dewey and Gale investigate a nearby abandoned car. Many party attendees are drawn away after hearing news of Himbry's death; Sidney, Billy, Randy, Stu, and Gale's cameraman Kenny remain.|$|E
5|$|Christine Collins {{was placed}} in Los Angeles County Hospital by Captain Jones. After her release, she sued the police {{department}} twice, winning the second lawsuit. Although Captain Jones was ordered to pay Collins $10,800, he never did. A city council welfare hearing recommended that Jones and Chief of Police James E. Davis leave their posts, but both were later reinstated. The California State Legislature later made it illegal {{for the police to}} commit someone to a psychiatric facility without a warrant. Northcott was convicted <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders</b> of Lewis Winslow (12), Nelson Winslow (10) and an unidentified Mexican boy; after his conviction, Northcott was reported to have admitted to up to 20 murders, though he later denied the claim. Northcott was executed by hanging in 1930 at the age of 23. Sarah Louise was convicted of Walter Collins' murder and served almost 12 years in prison. In 1930, the residents of Wineville changed the town's name to Mira Loma to escape the notoriety brought by the case.|$|E

5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{dreams of}} a red light that leads him to the corpse {{of a young girl}} buried in a park in Manassas, Virginia. When he awakens, he heads to the park and finds the girl's skeleton. The girl was {{determined}} to have been murdered by John Lee Roche (Tom Noonan), a serial killer who murdered thirteen girls throughout the 1980s; his modus operandi was cutting a heart out of the clothes of each victim. Mulder had captured Roche by deducing that he committed the murders while traveling as a vacuum cleaner salesman. Roche's hearts were never found, although he confessed to all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hal Rogers's brother John {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{even though he}} was in state prison serving a sentence for the rape of a woman who had shared his trailer, at the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders.</b> Police, investigating the woman's rape allegation, found evidence indicating that he had also sexually assaulted Hal's daughter Michelle, although charges involving this assault were later dropped because of her reluctance to testify. The St. Petersburg Times said that John may have planned the murder as he had visited his parents' property near Tampa a month before the murders. However, as the police established John could not have hired a professional killer, did not have accomplices, and could not have known the timing of his sister-in-law's and nieces' trip, he was dismissed as a suspect.|$|E
5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to {{a police}} station when {{officers}} asked him to accompany them {{to talk about the}} murder of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply remained silent when they asked him whether shotgun casings found at the scene <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders</b> would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but did not say anything. Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that his silence in the face of that question showed that he was guilty, that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the simple fact of silence during police questioning, when an individual was not under arrest, could not be used against that person at a criminal trial.|$|E
