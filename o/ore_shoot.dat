40|$|The Bogoso {{gold deposit}} {{comprises}} 20 open pits scattered along 18 km {{of a major}} fault zone which separates Birimian Supergroup turbiditic sedimentary rocks to the northwest from Tarkwaian Group rocks to the southeast. Individual pits are centered on 200 - to 400 -m-long <b>ore</b> <b>shoots</b> which are located in three broad structural settings. Steeply pitching, relatively high-grade orebodies are commonly localized in left-hand dilational jogs in the strike of the controlling faults. These jogs often coincide with intersecting minor faults. Gold is largely confined to the graphitic mylonite, which defines the fault, and imbricated slices of carbonate-altered rock. Gently dipping mineralized quartz vein stockworks and disseminated auriferous pyrite and arsenopyrite form broader zones between more steeply dipping bounding faults {{in the vicinity of}} right-hand bends and splays in these faults. Smaller zones of disseminated sulfide mineralization coincide with areas where bedding and/or foliation in the adjacent Birimian sedimentary rocks is strongly discordant with the adjacent mineralized fault, generally where the faults cut the short limbs of tight, upright, east-trending folds. Approximately 75 percent of the gold extracted from the Bogoso district has been mined from a cluster of pits that coincides with the densest and most highly connected concentration of larger faults in the Bogoso concession. The majority of <b>ore</b> <b>shoots</b> are located along the largest of these faults. The narrower faults generally host smaller and less frequent <b>ore</b> <b>shoots.</b> The fault network originated during an early episode of regional-scale shortening involving thrusting and isoclinal folding. The structural setting and geometry of the <b>ore</b> <b>shoots</b> implies that mineralization occurred during a later minor episode of sinistral strike-slip movement on the controlling faults, after development of the fault network. The undeformed nature of the auriferous sulfides implies that this was the last phase of ductile-brittle deformation on the host faults. This conclusion is consistent with earlier work indicating that the giant Ashanti deposit 150 km along strike from Bogoso also developed during a period of small displacement sinistral offset late {{in the history of the}} host fault network...|$|R

40|$|Matchless is one {{of several}} metamorphosed massive copper-zinc sulfide {{deposits}} associated with the Matchless amphibolite belt in the upper Proterozoic Damara orogen (SWA/Namibia). In the footwall of the <b>ore</b> <b>shoots</b> are pyrite-bearing quartz-muscovite-(chlorite) schists with interlayered bands of massive pyrite-quartz rock and a distinctive biotite-rich marker schist. In the hanging wall of the <b>ore</b> <b>shoots</b> the wall rock consists of chloritic schists containing variable proportions of quartz, ankerite, and calcic amphibole, bands of magnetite quartzite, calc-silicate rock, and amphibolite. This rock association is regarded as representing a pre-metamorphic stratigraphic sequence. The initial deposit was formed in a subsiding trough in which active turbidite sedimentation formed the precursor ocks of the Kuiseb schists. Sedimentation was interrupted by submarine volcanic activity which produced the basaltic protolith of the Matchless amphibolite. Metal sulfides were precipitated from convecting hydrothermal fluids generated by the reaction of seawater with subsea-floor basalts and clastic sediments. This process was accompanied by an intense hydrothermal alteration of the basaltic wall rock, leading to silicification, chloritization, sulfidization, and in part also, to carbonatization. Geochemical changes in the basalts involved depletion in Na, Ca, and Sr and enrichment of Rb, Ba, Fe, S, and the base metals Cu, Zn, and Pb. Among the immobile lements, Y, and to a lesser extent, Ti, seems to be depleted. Compared to the unaffected turbiditic sediments, the altered sedimentary wall rocks of the deposit are depleted in Na, Ca, Sr, Rb, Ni, and the immobile elements Ce, Zr, Ti, V, and Y and enriched in Fe, S, Ba, Cu, and locally, Zn and Pb.

But the level to the north discovered the South <b>Ore</b> <b>Shoot,</b> a new lead-rich part of the vein in 1844. During the nineteenth century natural ventilation was adequate in the many interconnected levels of the mine. In blind headings a fan blast, worked by a boy, was used, or in very long drives a more powerful waterblast drove air down cast iron pipes to within a few yards of the miners at the forehead.|$|E
40|$|The Coeur d'Alene {{district}} of Idaho is a world-class, ilver-base metal district with produc-tion exceeding 1. 0 billion troy ounces of silver. Despite the prolific production history, {{little is known}} about the structural controls of ore deposition or the style of deformation which accompanied metallization. The role of strike-slip faulting has been emphasized by past workers as an important structural control of the mineralization. Structural data from the Sunshine mine show that the main sense of movement of structures during ore deposition was along a steep southwesterly ine during a dip-slip tectonic-metamorphic event. Kinematic indicators uggest mainly reverse motion during deformation and synchronous mineraliza-tion. Siderite-quartz veins variously oriented in the Sunshine mineralized zone intersect in a common line that plunges teeply to the southwest parallel to sliekenlines. Tetrahedrite-rieh <b>ore</b> <b>shoots</b> within the siderite-quartz veins also plunge southwest regardless of vein orienta-tion. The dip-slip fabrics associated with the mineralizing event cut the Big Creek anticline, yet evidence shows that preexisting fold fabrics were reactivated uring metallization...|$|R
50|$|The {{property}} contained 154 acres, {{with two}} veins worked. One vein {{was on the}} contact between the syenitic granite and slate formations, and the other lay entirely in the granite, 600 ft to the east, and in the hanging wall. The two veins dipped east at an angle of 36Â° to 40Â°. The main shaft was upon the eastern or Providence vein, and {{the greater part of}} the work in the past was prosecuted on this vein. The incline shaft was 1250 ft in depth, ten levels being turned, and extending an average distance of 2000 ft on the vein. The Providence vein was a larger one, running from 2 x 20 ft in size, and averaging over 6 ft. Four <b>shoots</b> of <b>ore</b> were discovered on it, running from 150 x 320 ft in length. These <b>ore</b> <b>shoots</b> all trended to the north. The work on this vein consisted of driving and opening ground on the 1100 ft and 1250 ft levels, and sinking the main shaft.|$|R
50|$|Hausel {{reported}} cursory {{investigations of}} the historic Carissa Mine during the late 1980s indicated this mine hosted an identifiable reserve of more than 109,000 ounces averaging 0.343 to 0.850 oz/ton with a cutoff grade of 0.299 oz/ton. But due to scattered drilling and lack of deep drilling on this property, this high-grade zone is probably much more extensive along strike and depth. The high cutoff grade combined with the essentially untested large tonnage low-grade mineralized zone associated with the property (>1000 feet wide and >1000 feet long) suggests actual gold resources are much greater. In addition to the Carissa property, a distinct belt of prospects and historic mines lie between the Carissa mine and Miners Delight mine along a 4 to 5 mile northeasterly trend in the belt. This provides a structurally favorable zone for a major gold resource. Mapping by Hausel identified numerous shear structures along with steeply plunging <b>ore</b> <b>shoots</b> associated with isoclinal and open folding that may be favorable for saddle reef-type gold mineralization. There {{is little evidence that}} any of the historic operations recognized the steeply plunging structures as being significant.|$|R
