5|$|Like Vishnu's {{first two}} avatars - Matsya (fish) and Kurma (turtle), the third avatar Varaha is {{depicted}} either in zoomorphic form as an animal (a wild boar), or anthropomorphically. The main {{difference in the}} anthropomorphic form portrayal {{is that the first}} two avatars are depicted with a torso <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> the bottom half as animal, while Varaha has an animal (boar) head and a human body. The portrayal of the anthropomorphic Varaha is similar to the fourth avatar Narasimha (portrayed as a lion-headed man), who is the first avatar of Vishnu that is not completely animal.|$|E
5|$|Parvateshvar– Head of Meluhan Army and a Suryavanshi, Parvateshvar is a {{follower}} of Shiva. However, he is caught in a dilemma when Shiva decides to destroy Meluha for ending the usage of Somras, and ultimately decides to help the country by leading it in the impending war, being bound to his duty as the protector of the country. He {{is a man of}} his word and places truth and honour even above God. He is a tall, well-built giant <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> is husband to Princess Anandamayi.|$|E
50|$|After NASA had {{received}} criticism over the nudity on the Pioneer plaque (line drawings <b>of</b> <b>a</b> naked <b>man</b> <b>and</b> woman), the agency {{chose not to}} allow Sagan and his colleagues to include <b>a</b> photograph <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nude <b>man</b> <b>and</b> woman on the record.

5|$|At {{the same}} time as the grand Roman villa was being {{excavated}} at Durley Hill Cemetery, a second smaller villa was discovered during the construction of Fry's Somerdale Chocolate Factory. Two fine stone coffins were found, interred with the remains <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> a woman. The villa and coffins were removed to a place near the gates of the factory grounds, and construction on the factory went ahead. Fry's built in the grounds of the factory a museum which for many years housed the Durley Hill mosaics, the coffins, and numerous other artefacts. In 2012, Taylor Wimpey, about to develop the factory site, made a detailed geophysical assessment of the area, and discovered an additional 15 Roman buildings centered around a Roman road beneath Keynsham Hams, with evidence of additional Roman buildings that had been disturbed by quarrying.|$|E

25|$|Neither {{same-sex}} marriages nor civil unions of same-sex couples are allowed in Russia. Article 12 of the Family Code de facto states {{that marriage is}} a union <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> a woman.|$|E
25|$|Shima-uta {{is often}} {{performed}} alternatively {{by a pair}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> a woman. When one sings, the other must answer. One must choose and sing the most appropriate song in reply to the other's song. This style of performance is called utakake.|$|E
25|$|The image most {{associated}} with Abraxas {{is that of}} a composite creature with the head of a rooster, the body <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>and</b> legs made of serpents or scorpions. He carries a whip and shield, called wisdom and power. Occasionally Abraxas is depicted driving a chariot drawn by four horses, probably representing the elements.|$|E

25|$|Sioux chiefs Little Wound and Pawnee Killer {{and their}} {{followers}} of Cut-off Oglalas had hunted along tributaries to the Republican further west.

25|$|Unequal {{value for}} women's {{testimony}} {{compared to that}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>and</b> traditional attitudes towards women's behavior and clothing {{as a way of}} explaining rape have made conviction for rape of women difficult if not impossible in Iran. One widely criticized case was that of Atefah Sahaaleh, who was executed by the state for 'inappropriate sexual relations', despite evidence she was most probably a rape victim.|$|E

25|$|In December 2013, the High Court of Australia ruled, in {{relation}} to a territory-based same-sex marriage law of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), that the federal Marriage Act, which defined marriage as the union <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> woman, precluded states and territories from legislating for same-sex marriage. As a result, only the Federal Parliament can legislate for same-sex marriage, whilst states and territories almost certainly cannot.|$|E
25|$|One {{way that}} {{polygyny}} is still legally practiced in Iran today {{is through the}} practice of mut'a, a temporary contractual relationship based on the mutual consent <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> a woman. Throughout the contracted time, the woman must remain exclusively faithful to the man, and in return he must provide for her financially. Although this practice is technically legal, it is very highly disputed.|$|E
25|$|The {{archaeologist}} Elena Efimovna Kuzmina enlists clear {{parallels between}} the burial practices of the ancient Asiatic steppe Andronovo cultures (fl. 1800–1400 BC) and the Vedic Age. In Kuzmina's archaeological definition, sati is understood as a double burial, the co-cremation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> a woman/wife, a feature {{to be found in}} both cultures. Kuzʹmina states that in the Androvo culture and Vedic age, the practice was never strictly observed and was symbolic.|$|E

25|$|In March 2014, the FBI {{established}} {{a task force}} to re-examine the murders, after new DNA evidence cast doubt on the conviction of Cathy Woods, now 64, for Mitchell's murder. The DNA taken from a cigarette butt found at the Mitchell crime scene matched DNA taken from semen found at related crime scenes in San Mateo, California. This DNA was that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> therefore might exonerate Woods.|$|E
25|$|The next day, when Dan, Tobey and Callie Rose get together, Callie Rose is {{shot by a}} hail {{of bullets}} from McAuley. Her surgery is successful, but she ends up in coma.

Sephy does not know that Tobey has sworn revenge on McAuley and plans on doing so 'himself'.|$|E
25|$|On March 3, 2009, GLAD filed {{a federal}} court challenge, Gill v. Office of Personnel Management, based on the Equal Protection Clause and the federal government's {{consistent}} deference to each state's definition of marriage prior to the enactment of DOMA. The case questioned only the DOMA provision {{that the federal government}} defines marriage as the union <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> a woman. On May 6, 2010, Judge Joseph L. Tauro heard arguments in the U.S. District Court in Boston.|$|E
