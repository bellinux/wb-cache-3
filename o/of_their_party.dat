5|$|Washington {{became an}} {{international}} icon for liberation and nationalism, {{as the leader}} of the first successful revolution against a colonial empire. The Federalists made him the symbol <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>party</b> but, for many years, the Jeffersonians continued to distrust his influence and delayed building the Washington Monument. On January 31, 1781, he was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.|$|E

5|$|On 2 December 2016, Jet Airways flight 9W7083 from Bhopal to Mumbai {{was held}} up by {{a large group of}} {{passengers}} headed for a marriage in Mumbai. There were allegations from other passengers that the wedding party was politically connected and attempted to coerce the cabin crew to disembark passengers, so that additional members <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>party</b> could be accommodated. The airline claimed it was a technical glitch in their booking system which led to overbooking.|$|E

50|$|Barnett {{attributes}} this {{collaboration between}} opposing political organisations to a desire by the Conservatives {{to split the}} Labour EU referendum vote, {{as it has been}} alleged that Labour members are unsure <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>party's</b> position on Brexit.|$|R
5|$|Clay {{believed}} the Democrats would again nominate Martin Van Buren, who was ardently opposed to annexation, {{and this would}} keep annexation from becoming {{an issue in the}} campaign. Clay was nominated by acclamation at the Whig convention in Baltimore a week later. At the Democratic nominating convention a month later, however, Van Buren was unable to secure his party's nomination, and the Democrats instead nominated James K. Polk, who strongly favored annexation. Clay tried to moderate his views on annexation, but his changes of position drew opposition from supporters of {{both sides of the issue}} as he attempted to find a middle ground. Polk went on to win the election in a close race. This was the last time Clay would be nominated for president, and many Whigs believed that, following Clay's defeat, Crittenden was the new leader <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E

40|$|Parliamentary {{representation}} is a fluid concept. Yet, while the behaviour of elected representatives during roll call votes {{has been widely}} analysed, we know little about how parliamentarians act when their individual voting choices are not made public. This paper explores the relationship between voting procedures and the likelihood that Members of the European Parliament prioritise the interests <b>of</b> <b>their</b> EP <b>party</b> group versus the interests <b>of</b> <b>their</b> national <b>party.</b> Using an original survey, I find that MEPs {{are more likely to}} prioritise the interests <b>of</b> <b>their</b> national <b>party</b> over those <b>of</b> <b>their</b> EP <b>party</b> group when voting by show of hands or electronically, as opposed to by roll call. Moreover, this voting procedure effect is particularly salient among MEPs elected from 2004 / 07 accession countries...|$|R

25|$|The {{party leader}} Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu stated that his party {{would lead the}} next {{government}} if they won 35% of the vote. This indicates a 9% rise since the 2011 general election. Kılıçdaroğlu had been re-elected as leader during the party's 18th Extraordinary Convention held in September 2014, which had been convened after the party's poor performance in the 2014 local elections and the 2014 presidential election. On 28 March 2015, the CHP released a documentary named Anadolu'nun Kemal'i (The Kemal of Anatolia) about the early life and career <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>party</b> leader.|$|E
25|$|In 1860, {{the ill-fated}} Burke and Wills led the first north-south {{crossing}} of the continent from Melbourne to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Lacking bushcraft and unwilling {{to learn from the}} local Aboriginal people, Burke and Wills died in 1861, having returned from the Gulf to their rendezvous point at Coopers Creek only to discover the rest <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>party</b> had departed the location only a matter of hours previously. Though an impressive feat of navigation, the expedition was an organisational disaster which continues to fascinate the Australian public.|$|E

60|$|In {{the talk}} which followed, Bradley was brought {{face to face}} with the fact that these men were more earnest in {{maintaining}} the hold <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>parties</b> upon the offices than principles of legislation.

25|$|The {{expedition}} made {{it as far}} as the mountain, but encountered many difficulties on the way. The {{country they}} passed through was full of plague and famine. Many Kikuyu porters tried to desert with women from the villages, and others stole from the villages, which made the chiefs very hostile towards the expedition. When they reached the base camp on 18 August, they could not find any food, had two <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>party</b> killed by the local people, and eventually had to send Saunders to Naivasha to get help from Captain Gorges, the Government Officer there.|$|E
25|$|On his {{election}} as party leader Murphy {{said he was}} determined under his leadership Labour would not lose any MPs to the SNP in the British general election of May 2015. On 27 February 2015, Murphy {{announced that he would}} again stand for the Westminster parliamentary seat of East Renfrewshire in the election. In the run-up to the United Kingdom general election, 2015, Murphy predicted that a late swing would save Labour in spite of unfavourable polls. During his campaign, the SNP suspended two members <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>party</b> after it emerged that they had disrupted Murphy's speeches with fellow campaigner Eddie Izzard.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{judgement}} of one historian, [...] "Both political {{camps and}} unionist expected the gratitude of the British administration for {{their willingness to}} sacrifice themselves and {{the rank and file}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>parties.</b> Neither foresaw that in the First World War, all special interests would be expendable".|$|R
5000|$|The United Left (Vereinigte Linke) was an {{alliance}} of several leftist opposition groupings in the German Democratic Republic.

25|$|The strike {{also gave}} the Communist League, later renamed the Workers Party of America, a strong {{position}} in Local 574, and in other Teamster locals within the metropolitan area of Minneapolis. Trotskyist strength grew to over 100 members. This gave leadership to the Trotskyists through the various unions they led within the Central Labor Council. As mentioned below, through organizing the first area-wide contract for any union outside of rail, the Trotskyists established locals <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>party</b> where ever there were Teamster locals, from South Dakota to Iowa to Colorado. The party was later driven out of that local by prosecutions under the Smith Act and a trusteeship imposed by Tobin in the early 1940s.|$|E
