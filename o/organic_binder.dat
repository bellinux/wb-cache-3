25|$|The x-ray {{diffraction}} {{of a sample}} from an unfired lump of pottery clay excavated at the Zebree (3MS20) site confirmed that the shell was burned before being added to the raw clay. Burning the shells eliminates the <b>organic</b> <b>binder</b> and the cooled, burnt shells are easily crushed into a shell temper of fine plate-like particles, some nearly powder. The hinges of the shells are discarded. Using burned shells is logical as unburned mussel shells are hard and very durable. In terms of soil technology, the addition of shell (calcium carbonate) {{has the effect of}} neutralizing the ionic charge of the clay particles. During the course of replicative pottery experiments, as the shell was added to the clay in the presence of water, distinct and immediate changes took place in the feel of the clay. With the valence neutral, the clay-temper combination produces a very satisfactory pottery clay. This modification of backswamp clay - particles now clumping instead of constantly slipping - into a well-behaved modeling clay would have been immediately noticed by the experienced prehistoric potter.|$|E
50|$|To achieve process {{temperatures}} beneath 450 °C {{leaded glass}} or lead silicate glass is used. The glass frit is a paste consisting glass powder, <b>organic</b> <b>binder,</b> inorganic fillers and solvents. This low melting glass paste is milled into powder (grain size < 15 µm) and mixed with <b>organic</b> <b>binder</b> forming a printable viscous paste. Inorganic fillers, i.e. cordierite particles (e.g. Mg2Al3 AlSi5O18) or barium silicate, {{are added to}} the melted glass paste to influence properties, i.e. lowering the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients between silicon and glass frit. The solvents are used to adjust the viscosity of the <b>organic</b> <b>binder.</b> Several glass frit pastes are commercially available, e.g. FERRO FX-11-0366, and every single one need individual handling after deposition. The choice of the paste depends on various factors, i.e. deposition method, substrate material and process temperatures.|$|E

30|$|Elsewere, Casoli and {{co-workers}} analysed the <b>organic</b> <b>binders</b> in wall paintings from various houses in Herculaneum [22] and Pompeii [3], and the painting technique was hypothesized as being fresco {{in all the}} samples. This technique has not often been identified in studies analysing <b>organic</b> <b>binders</b> in Roman wall painting. Therefore, the ratio of samples ascribed to fresco in these studies seems to be remarkably high compared to other studies, This high ratio between samples ascribed to a specific painting technique by a particular research group is a bewildering characteristic common to most studies of Roman painting techniques, again rising questions about possible causes.|$|R
50|$|First, {{material}} is laid {{up in its}} intended final shape, with carbon filament and/or cloth surrounded by an <b>organic</b> <b>binder</b> such as plastic or pitch. Often, coke or some other fine carbon aggregate {{is added to the}} binder mixture.|$|E
50|$|The <b>organic</b> <b>binder</b> of {{the glass}} paste has to be burned with heating up to a {{specific}} temperature (325 to 350 °C) where the glass is not fully melted for 10 to 20 minutes. This so-called glazing ensures the outgassing of the organic additives.|$|E
50|$|The initial step {{comprises}} drying for 5 to 7 {{minutes at}} 100 to 120 °C {{in order to}} diffuse solvents out of the interface. This starts the polymerization of the <b>organic</b> <b>binder.</b> The binder molecules are linked to long-chain polymers what solidifies the paste.|$|E
50|$|Mineral wools, {{including}} {{rock and}} slag wools, are inorganic strands of mineral fibre bonded together using <b>organic</b> <b>binders.</b> Mineral wools {{are capable of}} operating at high temperatures and exhibit good fire performance ratings when tested.|$|R
50|$|When these fibers are bonded with cement or magnesite, {{bonded wood}} wool boards are produced. Slabs of bonded wood wool are {{considered}} environmentally friendly construction and insulation materials {{because they do}} not contain <b>organic</b> <b>binders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Polysilazanes are {{suitable}} precursors for ceramic materials. Since most ceramic materials {{are produced by}} powder processing and sintering, near net shape forming {{is very difficult for}} complex components. With the aid of <b>organic</b> <b>binders</b> added to ceramic powders, injection molding or other casting techniques are possible, but removal of the organics (“debinding”) is expensive and results in fragile “white bodies” which are difficult to handle and shrink significantly during sintering. Pre-ceramic polymers can replace these <b>organic</b> <b>binders.</b> After compounding, casting and curing, the thermoset material can be pyrolyzed in one step to give a ceramic component in high yield. However, this application {{is still in its infancy}} in the civilian area.|$|R

50|$|Fresco-secco (or a secco or fresco finto) is a wall {{painting}} technique where pigments {{mixed with}} an <b>organic</b> <b>binder</b> and/or lime are applied onto a dry plaster. The paints used can e.g. be casein paint, tempera, oil paint, silicate mineral paint. If the pigments {{are mixed with}} lime water or lime milk and applied to a dry plaster the technique is called lime secco painting. The secco technique contrasts with the fresco technique, where the painting is executed on a layer of wet plaster.|$|E

50|$|The fritware {{body was}} {{coated with a}} thin layer of white slip. This had a similar {{composition}} to the fritware paste used for the body, but the components were more finely ground and more carefully selected to avoid iron impurities that would discolour the white surface. It is likely that an <b>organic</b> <b>binder</b> was also added such as tragacanth gum. Although in his treatise Abū'l-Qāsim recommended that fritware vessels were allowed to dry in the sun before being decorated, it is probable that Iznik ceramics was given a bisque firing. The pottery was painted with pigments that had been mixed with glass frit and ground in a wet quern. For some designs the outlines were pounced through a stencil.|$|E
50|$|Metal clay is a {{crafting}} medium {{consisting of}} very small particles of metal such as silver, gold, bronze, or copper mixed with an <b>organic</b> <b>binder</b> and water {{for use in}} making jewelry, beads and small sculptures. Originating in Japan in 1990, metal clay can be shaped just like any soft clay, by hand or using molds. After drying, the clay can be fired {{in a variety of}} ways such as in a kiln, with a handheld gas torch, or on a gas stove, depending on the type of clay and the metal in it. The binder burns away, leaving the pure sintered metal. Shrinkage of between 8% and 30% occurs (depending on the product used). Alloys such as bronze, sterling silver, and steel also are available.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{performed}} {{together with the}} Technical University Bergakademie Freiberg. The aim is to extend the basic knowledge concerning scientific and technological aspects of the waterglass process for production of cores and moulds. This procedure should be introduced more frequently into practice or should prove its advantages in competition to sand systems with <b>organic</b> <b>binders.</b> Main hardening agents were CO_ 2 and ester. Alternative hardening was performed by microwave-drying. Further aims {{for research and development}} are to investigate the influence of reclaimed waterglass-sand on other core binder systems, additionally the influence of waterglass-bound sand on the moulding sand bound with bentonite. Waterglass-bound sands with small additions of bentonite showed good results, because residual compressive strength was significantly reduced compared to sands without additional to bentonite. Drying by microwave was more effective than hardening by CO_ 2. Reclaimed waterglass-bound sand could be used completely in the same system (monosystem) without problems. Some types of reclaimed sand systems with <b>organic</b> <b>binders</b> could only be used in the waterglass process, if they were dried by microwaves. Moulding material with bentonite may be refreshed by waterglass-bound sands without problems.

30|$|The {{weight ratio}} of MWCNT/glass frit/indium tin oxide (ITO) powder/Ethyl cellulose/α-terpineol was 1 : 10 : 2 : 9 : 100. MWCNT powder grown by {{chemical}} vapor deposition {{was used as an}} electron emission source and glass frit as an inorganic binder to enhance the adhesion between MWCNT and the substrate after firing. MWCNT field emitters and the vacuum gauge were fabricated by the screen-printing process, where the field emitters were used as electron source. In the mixture of MWCNTs, the <b>organic</b> <b>binder</b> was premixed through an ultra-sonication for 30 min. Then, a three-roll milling process was carried out for mixing and dispersion of MWCNTs in the <b>organic</b> <b>binder</b> to form a polymer matrix. Mechanically well-dispersed MWCNT paste was printed onto an ITO glass. The residue of <b>organic</b> <b>binder</b> leads to problems such as outgassing and arcing during a field emission measurement. Therefore, organic materials in paste were removed by drying the printed MWCNT paste in the furnace for 30 min at 400 °C to obtain stable emission characteristics.|$|E

40|$|Fused silica {{ceramics}} {{was prepared}} by using conventional <b>organic</b> <b>binder,</b> mathacrylamide-N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (MAM-MBAM) system by gelcasting process. Mechanical properties of green bodies were studied {{as a function}} of solid loading varying from 60 to 72 vol%. After evaluating the green body mechanical properties, the samples were densified at different sintering temperature from 1200 to 1450 °C with definite intervals of 50 °C and subjected to flexural strength analysis. Variation in flexural strength with sintering temperature was observed and correlated with the quantity of devitrification of fused silica during sintering. Quantification of devitrified cristobalite was carried out by using 20 wt% rutile (TiO 2) as an internal standard by X-ray diffraction. It was found that, as the cristobalite content increased, flexural strength decreased. Reliability studies were carried out for the samples having maximum flexural strength with and without crystalline content. Reliability studies have shown that for this <b>organic</b> <b>binder</b> system the sample sintered at 1300 °C is crystalline free and most reliable product.

The cycle of investigations in which thermal TG-DTA methods were applied as supplementary ones for the works on the optimisation of the thermal reclamation process is presented in the hereby paper.
