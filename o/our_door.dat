500|$|Initial first-run {{pressings}} of {{the international}} version of the Come On Over album during March 1998 featured White on the song, while subsequent pressings began featuring the song as a solo recording. [...] In early 1998, Mercury executives were informed that White {{would be unable to}} promote the song alongside Twain; therefore, Twain had to return to the studio to re-record White's parts on her own. According to White's spokesman at Asylum Records, [...] "We've certainly heard knocking on <b>our</b> <b>door</b> about [...] "From This Moment On" [...] being too contemporary for Bryan's sake; therefore, it is fine if they {{want to go to the}} Top 40 without him." [...] White later claimed that he had no hard feelings towards Twain for him being excluded from the international version of the song, stating, [...] "They're releasing this song as a pop record, and I'm not a pop artist, so my feelings aren't hurt." ...|$|E
500|$|When Sullivan {{turned to}} comic opera with Gilbert, the serious critics began to express disapproval. Peter Gammond writes of [...] "misapprehensions and prejudices, {{delivered}} to <b>our</b> <b>door</b> by the Victorian firm Musical Snobs Ltd. ... frivolity and high spirits were sincerely seen as elements {{that could not}} be exhibited by anyone who was to be admitted to the sanctified society of Art." [...] As early as 1877 The Figaro wrote that Sullivan [...] "has all the ability to make him a great composer, but he wilfully throws his opportunity away. ... He possesses all the natural ability to have given us an English opera, and, instead, he affords us a little more-or-less excellent fooling." [...] Few critics denied the excellence of Sullivan's theatre scores. The Theatre wrote that [...] "Iolanthe sustains Dr Sullivan's reputation as the most spontaneous, fertile, and scholarly composer of comic opera this country has ever produced." [...] However, comic opera, no matter how skilfully crafted, was viewed as an intrinsically lower form of art than oratorio. The Athenaeum's review of The Martyr of Antioch declared: [...] "t is an advantage to have the composer of H.M.S. Pinafore occupying himself with a worthier form of art." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the days}} that followed, Latter Day Saint vigilantes under the {{direction}} and encouragement of Lyman Wight drove Missourians who lived in outlying farms from their homes, which were similarly plundered and burned. [...] According to one witness, [...] "We could stand in <b>our</b> <b>door</b> and see houses burning every night for over two weeks... the Mormons completely gutted Daviess County. [...] There was scarcely a Missourian's home left standing in the county. [...] Nearly every one was burned." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{his party}} falling under the {{influence}} of Romanian Communists, Baciu remained close to the independent pro-Western wing, under Constantin Titel Petrescu. As he would note in 1992, Baciu had always been [...] "an adept of democratic socialism". He referred to Petrescu as [...] "the tocsin-sounder of the great perils that were knocking on <b>our</b> <b>door,</b> perils not just for the existence of social democracy, but also of Romania's very existence as a free democratic state".|$|E
2500|$|Paul VI was {{the first}} pope to receive an Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey in {{official}} audience as Head of Church, after the private audience visit of Archbishop Geoffrey Fisher to Pope John XXIII on 2 December 1960. [...] Ramsey met Paul three times during his visit and opened the Anglican Centre in Rome to increase their mutual knowledge. [...] He praised Paul VI and his contributions {{in the service of}} unity. Paul replied that [...] "by entering into our house, you are entering your own house, we are happy to open <b>our</b> <b>door</b> and heart to you." [...] The two Church leaders signed a common declaration, which {{put an end to the}} disputes of the past and outlined a common agenda for the future.|$|E
2500|$|Garner has {{campaigned for}} laws {{to protect her}} {{children}} from paparazzi. [...] "There's an idea that because our pictures are everywhere that we are complicit in it. When really what happens is they're waiting outside <b>our</b> <b>door</b> every single day. My kids take karate for example, and we have our classes {{at the same time}} every week. So the guys know when we have karate, and so 20 of them wait there for us every single class. So that's a lot of energy coming at little, little kids." [...] In August 2013, Garner testified alongside Halle Berry before the California Assembly Judiciary Committee in support of a bill that would protect celebrities' children from harassment by photographers. The bill passed in September 2013 and is now California law.|$|E
