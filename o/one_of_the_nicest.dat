Max leaves, but {{on the day of}} Donna's abortion, he arrives at her home with flowers and asks if he can accompany her to her procedure. While at the clinic he tells her he supports her, and that when he said {{that he wanted to be}} a grandfather, he meant sometime far in the future. The two agree that this is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nicest</b> Valentine's Days they have ever had. After the abortion, Max takes Donna to his home where he makes her tea, and then they watch Gone with the Wind together.|$|E

The collaboration with the Dust Brothers, his second, was notable for their use of high-tech measures to achieve a lo-fi sound. For example, after recording a [...] "sonically perfect" [...] version of a song at <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nicest</b> recording studios in Hollywood, the Dust Brothers processed it in an Echoplex to create a gritty, reverb-heavy sound: [...] "We did this high-tech recording and ran it through a transistor radio.

500|$|In retirement, the {{throwing}} issue continued to dog the former paceman. Former Australian captain and teammate Simpson {{wrote a book}} titled Captain's Story in which he assailed various cricketers—Meckiff chief among them—for throwing. Meckiff sued for libel in a five-year case, which ended with an out-of-court settlement and apology from Simpson. Despite this, Meckiff has continued to socialise with people involved in his last Test, including Simpson, Egar, Gibbs, Rowan and Peter van der Merwe, South Africa's vice-captain. He says that he never brings up {{the topic of the}} no-ball with them. Victorian and Test teammate Lawry rated Meckiff [...] "along with Graham McKenzie, Brian Booth, Peter Burge and one or two others as really nature's gentlemen" [...] and said his exit was [...] "one of the saddest [...] of [...] life". Lawry credited his fellow Victorian for being dignified despite the torment and said the bowler was a [...] "pretty fair example of the old expression that good guys run last".

[...] In 1975, he voiced appreciation of the musical form and content of [...] "Surf's Up" [...] from Smile, which he believed went beyond what is normally expected of commercial pop music, {{and in the same}} 1992 article where he refers to some of the Pet Sounds lyrics as [...] "nauseating", he calls Parks a [...] "very gifted musician", saying: [...] "He's great.

2500|$|Upon its release, Killer Love {{received}} a mixed to positive response from critics. Some praised Scherzinger's strong vocals and conviction to convey emotion, while others criticized {{her choice of}} allowing RedOne to produce {{the majority of the}} album, stating that some of the songs sounded too similar to each other. The Observers Michael Cragg noted the album as being consistent with most other modern R albums, stating [...] "Killer Love is two thirds deliriously catchy pop stompers and one third balladry." [...] Cragg also noted that Scherzinger's [...] "not so inconsiderable voice" [...] takes a backseat allowing the record producers to inject their own influences into her music. Alex Macpherson from BBC Online commented that [...] "Scherzinger {{is one of the few}} pop performers with the requisite power to dominate [...] beats rather than vice versa. Killer Love is far from the album you sense Scherzinger could still deliver: at times, her personality is all that – barely – carries substandard, unmemorable songs." [...] Kim Dawson from The Daily Star was positive, saying that [...] "Nicole's solo record truly is killer and no filler." [...] Another positive reaction came from [...] "Entertainment Focus" [...] who went to say that: [...] "Killer Love is a competent and enjoyable record from <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nicest</b> women in pop. Fingers crossed this time it works out for her." [...] The 4Music review was also positive, noting that [...] "Killer Love will definitely establish her as a viable act in her own right."
