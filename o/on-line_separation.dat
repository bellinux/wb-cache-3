40|$|A microfluidic-based {{system has}} been {{developed}} for copper (II) monitoring in water samples with sensitive and selective detection, based on the measurement of light emitted from the copper (II) catalysed oxidation of 1, 10 -phenanthroline by hydrogen peroxide. Work initially focussed {{on the development of}} a flow injection analysis (FIA) system with micellar enhanced chemiluminescence (CL) detection. Sufficient selectivity was achieved by removing interfering metal ions using an on-line itaconic acid modified microcolumn, allowing copper (II) to be easily determined at concentrations as low as 1 jig L_ 1 from high concentrations of calcium (II) and magnesium (II). The FIA-CL system was further developed and scaled-down to create a microfluidicbased system. A number of different microflow devices, of various designs and dimensions, were manufactured from polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). A range of in-house micro-fabrication techniques were investigated for the fabrication of the microfluidic devices including hot embossing, laser ablation and direct micromilling. A complete miniaturised flow system was developed incorporating miniaturised peristaltic pumps, a microfluidic plastic manifold and a compact photomultiplier tube for CL detection. Experimental conditions including reagent concentrations and flow rates were optimised and the system was found to produce linear results for copper (II) over the concentration range 0 to 150 jxg L‘ Selectivity of the microfluidic-based CL system was further enhanced by incorporating an <b>on-line</b> <b>separation</b> step into the microflow manifold.

The system with fluid targets may establish a continuous transmutation system having <b>on-line</b> <b>separation</b> facilities for the elements transmuted by spallation and fission reactions. To realize the effective incineration system MA {{is designed to}} be transmuted mainly through fission reactions by fast neutrons and FP of Tc- 99 and 1 - 129 through neutron capture reactions by thermal neutrons. The total system of one accelerator with two fluid targets is discussed. In the preliminary study molten chloride salt of NaC 1 -(Pu,MA) Cla system is adopted for the target salt of MA transmutation, and Bi-Pb alloy for target fluid of neutron production to transmute the FP w“th a heavy water blanket. The amounts of MA and FP to be transmuted are estimated by the neutronics and thermal hydraulics calculations. The MA and long-lived FP produced approximately from 10 units of 3000 MWt LWR can be incinerated by about 25 mA and 150 mA of 1. 5 GeV proton beam, respectively. The principle of the separation of the transmuted elements in the continuous transmutation system is continuously to remove the stable and short-lived transmuted nuclides(elements) without contamination from the long-lived nuclides(elements). The transmuted elements in the molten chloride salt target can be classified into 3 groups considering the chloride formation energy.

The simultaneous perturbation method estimates a gradient of the mutual information with respect to the separating matrix, based on a kind of the finite difference. Therefore, the separating matrix is updated by only two values of the mutual information. Some examples for image signals and audio signals are shown to confirm viability of the proposed method.

The search for suitable conditions (stationary 19 phases, injection solvent, injection volume, design of interface) are discussed with a 20 view of ensuring a good transfer of the compounds between both dimensions, thereby 21 allowing high effective peak capacity in the second dimension. Instrumental aspects 22 that are of prime importance in <b>on-line</b> 2 D <b>separations,</b> were also tackled (dwell 23 volume, extra column volume and detection).
