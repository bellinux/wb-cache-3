5|$|The Sholes and Glidden {{typewriter}} incorporated several components {{adapted from}} existing devices, such as escapement (a mechanism governing carriage movement) adapted from clockwork, keys adapted from telegraph machines and type hammers {{adapted from the}} piano. In developing the first model, however, Sholes and Soule had not investigated printing machines created by other inventors and, consequently, developed several poor designs {{which could have been}} avoided. The failure to research earlier designs also led to the reinvention of features which had already been developed. Soule, for example, suggested a circular typebar <b>orientation.</b> <b>A</b> circular arrangement had been used more than 30years earlier in a machine designed by Xavier Progin in 1833.|$|E

25|$|While {{extremely}} powerful, {{it makes}} the most common case of object <b>orientation,</b> <b>a</b> struct-like object with some associated code, unnecessarily difficult. In addition, because Perl can make no assumptions about the object model in use, method invocation cannot be optimized very well.|$|E
5000|$|The {{notion of}} <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> of <b>a</b> vector bundle generalizes <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> of <b>a</b> {{manifold}}: <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> of <b>a</b> manifold is <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> of the tangent bundle of the manifold. In particular, a manifold is orientable if {{and only if}} its tangent bundle is orientable as a vector bundle. (note: as a manifold, a tangent bundle is always orientable.) ...|$|R
5000|$|A key {{concept in}} {{defining}} simplicial homology {{is the notion}} of <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> of <b>a</b> simplex. By definition, <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> of <b>a</b> k-simplex is given by an ordering of the vertices, written as (v0,...,vk), with the rule that two orderings define the same orientation if and only if they differ by an even permutation. Thus every simplex has exactly two orientations, and switching the order of two vertices changes <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> to the opposite orientation. For example, choosing <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> of <b>a</b> 1-simplex amounts to choosing one of the two possible directions, and choosing <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> of <b>a</b> 2-simplex amounts to choosing what [...] "counterclockwise" [...] should mean.|$|R
50|$|A {{tournament is}} <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> of <b>a</b> {{complete}} graph. A polytree is <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> of <b>an</b> undirected tree. Sumner's conjecture states that every tournament with 2n &minus; 2 vertices contains every polytree with n vertices.|$|R
25|$|With the {{introduction}} of matrices the Euler theorems were rewritten. The rotations were described by orthogonal matrices referred to as rotation matrices or direction cosine matrices. When used to represent an <b>orientation,</b> <b>a</b> rotation matrix is commonly called orientation matrix, or attitude matrix.|$|E
25|$|Studying human {{sexual arousal}} has proved a {{fruitful}} {{way of understanding}} how men and women differ as genders {{and in terms of}} sexual <b>orientation.</b> <b>A</b> clinical measurement may use penile or vaginal photoplethysmography, where genital engorgement with blood is measured in response to exposure to different erotic material.|$|E
25|$|Late palaces are {{characterized}} by multi-story buildings with west facades of sandstone ashlar masonry; Knossos is the best-known example. Other building conventions included storage areas, north-south <b>orientation,</b> <b>a</b> pillar room and a western court. Architecture during the First Palace Period is identified by a square-within-a-square style; Second Palace Period construction has more internal divisions and corridors.|$|E
5000|$|To give <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> to <b>a</b> real vector bundle E of rank n {{is to give}} <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> to the (real) {{determinant}} bundle [...] of E. Similarly, to give <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> to E is to give <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> to {{the unit}} sphere bundle of E.|$|R
50|$|A vector bundle {{together}} with <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> is called <b>an</b> oriented bundle. A vector bundle {{that can be}} given <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> is called <b>an</b> orientable vector bundle.|$|R
50|$|Every <b>orientation</b> of <b>a</b> tree is acyclic. The {{directed}} acyclic graph {{resulting from}} such <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> is called <b>a</b> polytree.|$|R
25|$|Some regular polyhedra and tilings (those with an {{even number}} of faces at each vertex) can also be {{considered}} quasiregular by differentiating between faces of the same number of sides, but representing them differently, like having different colors, but no surface features defining their <b>orientation.</b> <b>A</b> regular figure with Schläfli symbol {p,q} can be quasiregular, with vertex configuration (p.p)q/2, if q is even.|$|E
25|$|Various reasons {{have been}} given for the {{enrollment}} drop (and more than 100 campus closings). An article in The Wall Street Journal attributed the drop to operational changes amid criticism of high debt loads and low job prospects for students of for-profit colleges, while the University of Phoenix attributed it to operational changes including the implementation of student <b>orientation,</b> <b>a</b> free three-week trial period and a new entrance exam.|$|E
25|$|Equivalently (and with {{no need to}} {{arbitrarily}} choose two points) we can say that, {{given an}} arbitrary choice of <b>orientation,</b> <b>a</b> set of points determines a set of complex ratios given by the ratios {{of the differences between}} any two pairs of points. The set of ratios constructible using compass and straightedge from such a set of ratios is precisely the smallest field containing the original ratios and closed under taking complex conjugates and square roots.|$|E
50|$|An Eulerian <b>orientation</b> of <b>an</b> {{undirected graph}} G is an {{assignment}} of a direction to each edge of G such that, at each vertex v, the indegree of v equals the outdegree of v. Such <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> exists for any undirected graph {{in which every}} vertex has even degree, and may be found by constructing an Euler tour in each connected component of G and then orienting the edges according to the tour. Every Eulerian <b>orientation</b> of <b>a</b> connected graph is <b>a</b> strong <b>orientation,</b> <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> that makes the resulting directed graph strongly connected.|$|R
5000|$|If M is a {{manifold}} with boundary, then <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> of M {{is defined}} to be <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> of its interior. Such <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> induces <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> of ∂M. Indeed, suppose that <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> of M is fixed. Let [...] be a chart at a boundary point of M which, when {{restricted to the}} interior of M, is in the chosen oriented atlas. The restriction of this chart to ∂M is a chart of ∂M. Such charts form an oriented atlas for ∂M.|$|R

25|$|Alexeyev {{applied to}} the European Court of Human Rights, {{claiming}} the events surrounding the attempted marches in 2006 - 2008 had violated his right to freedom of assembly under Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights. He also claimed {{that he had not}} been able to access an effective remedy for the violation of Article 11, a violation of Article 13; and that the refusal to allow the marches to go forward had been discriminatory, in that it was made on the basis of his and other participants' sexual <b>orientation,</b> <b>a</b> violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 11.|$|E
25|$|Article 119-1 of the {{previous}} Criminal Code of Belarus set out that homosexual men having voluntary sexual contact were to be convicted to prison terms up to five years. In 1989 nearly 50 Belarusian citizens were fired due to their sexual <b>orientation.</b> <b>A</b> special department {{was set up in}} the KGB to combat homosexuality. The secret services used blackmail to recruit agents from the gay community. This prevented the possibility of the emergence of any gay organization, or print media designed specifically for sexual minorities. Nonetheless, gay people met in the streets, toilets, railway stations, or gathered in private flats or houses.|$|E
25|$|The small, {{possibly}} improvised temple on the eastside of {{the pyramid}} was constructed in the first building phase of the mortuary temple. The limestone temple has a north-south <b>orientation.</b> <b>A</b> step ramp enables entry from the southeast. This temple had a mandatory offering hall {{as well as a}} room for the ritual purgation on the entry. Imprints of an altar were at that time verifiable. A false door was located on the west wall, which contained gold-plated inscriptions. Offerings such as a bull head and sacrificial vessels were found below the paving of the temple. There might have been two boat pits at the temple for worship boats. No evidence was found in the remains for the builder, thus the direct successor of Raneferef is unknown. It is believed that short-ruling Shepseskare was the successor, as seal impressions of him were found {{in the area of the}} mortuary temple.|$|E
30|$|In addition, process <b>orientation</b> is <b>a</b> key [10, 17] to {{identifying}} optimisation potentials along the processes, with the customer’s requirements [18] being the trigger for every improvement. Furthermore, by applying process <b>orientation,</b> <b>an</b> optimisation within functional silos is avoided, a potential risk of PMS designed without a process perspective.|$|R

25|$|The Euler angles {{are three}} angles {{introduced}} by Leonhard Euler {{to describe the}} <b>orientation</b> of <b>a</b> rigid body {{with respect to a}} fixed coordinate system. They can also represent the <b>orientation</b> of <b>a</b> mobile frame of reference in physics or the <b>orientation</b> of <b>a</b> general basis in 3-dimensional linear algebra.|$|R
25|$|The player {{character}} can only jump {{and move to}} the left or right, however several different gameplay mechanics are applied to the game depending on the level. For example, one level can be rotated 90 degrees in the direction the player is facing to alter the level's gravity and vertical <b>orientation.</b> <b>A</b> second mechanic involves the use of a rope to swing through a level. Players can wrap the rope around cogs to rotate them. Yet another gameplay mechanic used involves a timer in the upper-right hand corner of the screen. When the timer reaches zero time effectively rewinds backwards the amount of time originally on the clock. The player character is unaffected, however a second, ghost image of the character will follow the movements the player made until the clock expired. This process repeats until the player completes the level. Should the player touch another iteration of the player character they fail the level. Several other mechanics are used throughout the levels, such as objects that change Shuggy's size, and teleportation.|$|E
25|$|Emmanuil Hrabar (1830–1910), {{father of}} Igor Grabar {{and his older}} {{brothers}} Bela and Vladimir (the future law scholar, 1865–1956), was an ethnic Rusyn lawyer and a politician of pro-Russian <b>orientation.</b> <b>A</b> strong critic of magyarization of Rusyns in Subcarpathian Rus, {{he was elected to}} the Hungarian Parliament in 1869, at the same time maintaining ties with slavophiles in Moscow and the Russian Embassy. Olga Hrabar (1843–1930), mother of Igor and Vladimir, was a daughter of Rusyn pro-Russian, anti-Catholic politician Adolph Dobryansky (1817–1901). According to Igor Grabar's memoirs, Dobryansky ran an underground network of obedient followers; the 1869 election was merely a means of shielding his son-in-law from prosecution. Dobryansky and his group, unaware of the realities of living in the Russian Empire, leaned to its official doctrine of Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality; Dobryansky, a man of wealth and pedigree, even imitated the lifestyle of a Russian landlord in minute details; two of his sons joined Imperial Russian service. Dobryansky praised the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 by Russian troops, dreaded by his own Rusyn peasants.|$|E
25|$|The {{peoples of}} Malaita share {{many aspects of}} their culture, {{although}} they are generally divided into ethnic groups along linguistic lines. In pre-colonial times, settlements were small and moved frequently. Both agnatic descent (patrilineal lines from a founding ancestor) and cognatic descent (through links of outmarrying women) are important. These lineages determine rights of residence and land use in a complex way. In the northern area, local descent groups, united in ritual hierarchies, are largely autonomous, but conceptualize their relationship as a phratry {{in a manner similar}} to certain groups in highland New Guinea. In the central area, local descent groups are fully autonomous, though still linked by ritual. In the south, the 'Are'are people developed a more hierarchical organization and more outward <b>orientation,</b> <b>a</b> cultural tradition that reaches its peak on the hereditary chiefs and rituals of Small Malaita to the south. One exception to these generalizations are cultures which have migrated in more recent times, such as the northern Lau, who settled in several seaside areas (and offshore islands) in southern Malaita about 200 years ago, and with whom there has been little cultural exchange.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> of <b>a</b> real vector bundle is a {{generalization}} of <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> of <b>a</b> vector space; thus, given a real vector bundle π: E →B, <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> of E means: for each fiber Ex, there is <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> of the vector space Ex and one demands that each trivialization map (which is a bundle map)is fiberwise orientation-preserving, where Rn {{is given the}} standard orientation. In more concise terms, this says that the structure group of the frame bundle of E, which is the real general linear group GLn(R), {{can be reduced to}} the subgroup consisting of those with positive determinant.|$|R
50|$|Minimising the fit {{involves}} {{starting with}} all possible <b>orientations</b> for <b>a</b> triplet. More bands are included {{that reduces the}} number of candidate <b>orientations.</b> <b>As</b> the number of bands increases, the number of possible orientations converge ultimately to one solution. The 'fit' between the measured orientation and the captured pattern can be determined.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} <b>orientation</b> of <b>a</b> curve {{is just a}} {{particular}} case {{of the notion of}} <b>orientation</b> of <b>a</b> manifold (that is, besides <b>orientation</b> of <b>a</b> curve one may also speak of <b>orientation</b> of <b>a</b> surface, hypersurface, etc.). Here, the interior and the exterior of a curve both inherit the usual orientation of the plane. The positive orientation on the curve is then the orientation it inherits as the boundary of its interior; the negative orientation is inherited from the exterior.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} portion of Toole's {{military}} career {{one of his}} primary motivations for advancement was to acquire a private office. Privacy was a significant luxury on the island {{with some of the}} men renting rooms in nearby hotels so they could have some solitude. Toole's army buddy David Kubach, also an aspiring writer, lent him a green Swedish-made Halda typewriter for use in his office. The barracks consisted solely of college educated English professors, which gave it a different makeup from usual army companies. In contrast to almost all other army barracks where gays kept their sexual <b>orientation</b> <b>a</b> secret, there was an openly gay contingent which flaunted their homosexuality. The gay men reserved a portion of the barracks for themselves and as they did not proposition any of the straight instructors, they were left alone. However, this particular group of gay men drank significantly more {{than the rest of the}} group and eventually began to exhibit a loud, rowdy, and vulgar brand of behavior that made the straight men uncomfortable. Toole's response was to ignore their behavior and it lost him the respect of some of the men in the barracks. The problem came to a head when a gay instructor attempted suicide by overdosing on APC (aspirin, phenacetin, and caffeine) tablets after being spurned by another soldier. When Toole found the man he waited a half-hour to call for help, hoping he would awaken on his own. His friend Kubach stated that this was because it would look bad for the soldier and that he would most likely get himself court martialed for a suicide attempt. Some of his fellow soldiers were livid and held a meeting deciding whether to report Toole's negligence. Ultimately, they did not report his behavior and the army never filed any charges but his relationships with many of the men were irrevocably changed.|$|E
500|$|In October 2001, Ford {{broke with}} {{conservative}} {{members of the}} Republican Party by stating that gay and lesbian couples [...] "ought to be treated equally. Period." [...] He became the highest ranking Republican to embrace full equality for gays and lesbians, stating his belief {{that there should be}} a federal amendment outlawing anti-gay job discrimination and expressing his hope that the Republican Party would reach out to gay and lesbian voters. He also was a member of the Republican Unity Coalition, which The New York Times described as [...] "a group of prominent Republicans, including former President Gerald R. Ford, dedicated to making sexual <b>orientation</b> <b>a</b> non-issue in the Republican Party".|$|E
500|$|Burial 5 was {{an elite}} burial interred in a stucco-coated chamber under the rear {{chamber of the}} Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49).
