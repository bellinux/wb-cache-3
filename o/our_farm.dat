2500|$|McCreight well {{recalled}} {{the story of}} David’s father Felix Flying Hawk, jailed in the early 1900s for stealing his own horses, and the injustice visited upon Native Americans. However, despite McCreight’s considerable efforts, David spent almost a year in county jails. The impact on David’s family was catastrophic, and without his help, Felix’s farm failed. Felix wrote McCreight. [...] “And they make spoil my family no farm on this year, because my son David was in jail and nobody can not help to work on <b>our</b> <b>farm,</b> and also David's sister, age 20 years, she was dead on May 15, 1927, for I am sorry everythings.” McCreight reported that, “My investigation shows that {{he was charged with}} stealing ponies, two having come into his possession in a trade in which he sold to some horse buyers without having changed the brands. [...] It is only one more of the many examples of persecution of the poor red man by the grafting, cowardly, agency officials.

5000|$|There are two {{ideas of}} government.

40|$|The {{program of}} {{structural}} changes in <b>our</b> <b>farming,</b> initiated {{in the past}} and oriented at direct forms of socialising the land, has not brought any satisfactory results. The course aiming at national self-sufficiency in food, in the conditions of limited supplies of the means of production, forces us to seek new solutions, ones which would to a greater extent take into account the specific nature of <b>our</b> <b>farming.</b> The great differences in the production and economic results of the various agricultural sectors enables us to see the perfecting of agricultural structural as one of the instruments of raising the effectiveness of management.

60|$|The road {{which led}} from <b>our</b> <b>farm</b> {{to the village}} school crossed a sandy ridge and often in June our path became so hot that it burned the soles of our feet.
