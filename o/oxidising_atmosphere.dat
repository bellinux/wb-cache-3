Analytical solutions of the MHHR/MMLR have been developed for infinitely fast heat transfer between the gas and solid. It has also been proposed that the MHRR in a TGA apparatus is proportional to the heat of combustion divided by the heat of gasification of the material. This conclusion was reached by the observed nearly linear relation of the MHRR in the TGA with the heat release rate per unit area in the cone calorimeter for thermally thick samples. In this work, we investigate the MMLR in the TGA for both finite and infinite rates heat transfer by analytical solutions and numerical calculations. A universal expression between the MMLR and equipment and material parameters is deduced. The derived expression is subsequently validated against experimental data of two polymers (PA 6 and PBT).

5000|$|Though {{the recipe}} of tin glazes may differ in {{different}} sites and periods, {{the process of}} the production of tin glazes is similar.

After the mixture cooled, the tin oxide crystallises as what has been mentioned above, therefore generates the so-called white tin-opacified glazes. Besides, the body of tin-opacified wares is generally calcareous clays containing 15-25% CaO, of which the thermal expansion coefficient is close to that of tin glazes, thus avoid crazing during the firing process.

The reaction under consideration is CrCl₃ (s) + ¾ O₂ (g) → ½ Cr₂O₃ (s) + ³/₂ Cl₂ (g). The main experimental techniques used were isothermal and programmed-temperature thermogravimetry, supplemented by scanning electron-microscopy, surface-area determinations and porosity measurements. The effects of sample pelletisation, gas flowrate, temperature, oxygen partial pressure, pellet porosity and the addition of other oxide species on the rate and extent of reaction have been studied. The reaction is shown to occur in a single step, starting at - 350 °C under non-isothermal conditions, and exhibiting a deceleratory rate over most of the reaction. Isothermal thermogravimetric curves were fitted to a number of kinetic rate expressions, and a series of statistical analyses used to identify the rate equation which best describes the experimental data. Supporting evidence was provided by scanning electron-microscopic examination of partially-reacted samples. It is concluded that the reaction is under chemical control, and that reaction occurs by means of a linearly-advancing reactant-product interface. The reaction kinetics can be described by a contracting-geometry rate expression. KMBT_ 363 Adobe Acrobat 9. 54 Paper Capture Plug-i...|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} known that {{increasing}} levels {{of greenhouse gases}} in the atmosphere absorb heat radiation and so raise the earth’s surface temperature. CO 2 forms 77 % of global anthropogenic emissions; so stabilizing CO 2 levels could provide a means to control the human impact on global average temperatures. Fossil fuel combustion, being {{a major source of}} CO 2 emission would {{be a good place to}} begin. Two relatively new techniques for CO 2 capture are Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) and Chemical Looping with Oxygen Uncoupling (CLOU). Both methods use two fluidized bed reactors, an air reactor and a fuel reactor with oxygen carriers (usually metal oxides) circulating between them. In CLC, the oxygen carriers react with fuel and in CLOU, they release gaseous O 2 for fuel conversion. Once depleted of O 2, they move on to the air reactor to be replenished. As seen, oxygen carriers are an integral part of these processes. To improve their performance, it is possible to combine and form a bi-metal oxide system. One such system that shows promise, especially in CLOU, is the iron manganese oxide. It is produced, usually by freeze granulation of Fe 2 O 3 and Mn 3 O 4 in specific proportions. This thesis studies three samples in particular: M 24 F 1100, M 40 F 1100 and M 79 F 1100 containing 24, 40 and 79 wt% Mn 3 O 4 respectively. The oxides were studied while heating them in inert and <b>oxidising</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> X-ray diffraction of the samples was conducted once they cooled down.

M 79 F 1100 had the highest capacity but did not react with O 2 until cooled to 780 oC. XRD results show similar phase behaviour in M 24 F 1100 and M 40 F 1100.

40|$|The {{production}} of Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) normally entails the smelting of PGM flotation concentrates, converting of the furnace matte and {{removal of the}} bulk of the Ni, Cu, Co, S and Fe through atmospheric and pressure leaching in a base metals refinery to produce a PGM-rich concentrate. A number of impurities, mostly Se, Te, As, Bi, Os and Pb, are not removed significantly during the oxidising leach process in sulphuric acid media. In addition slag inclusions in matte leads to contamination of the PGM residues with silica, fayalite, magnetite and trevorite phases. Furthermore some Cu, Ni, Fe and S also remain. For this reason a typical Precious Metal Refinery (PMR) feed material contains less than 65 % PGMs. The PMR is based on a chloride process and requires contaminants to be within narrow specification limits to prevent the formation of PGM residues that must be reprocessed or tolled, leading to poor first pass metal efficiencies and extending the duration of the production pipeline for efficient recovery. A process has been developed to significantly upgrade the BMR leach residues through pyrometallurgical processing, which include a multistep process of roasting under <b>oxidising</b> <b>atmospheres,</b> a two-step smelting process of the roasted calcine (with engineered slag chemistry and slag-refractory interactions) and subsequent atomisation of the molten alloy which can be fed as a slurry into the HCl/Cl 2 dissolution reactors in the precious metals refinery. These pyrometallurgical steps upgrade the BMR residue from a 45 – 50 % grade up to an alloy grade of ca. 90 % PGMs, whilst removing the most deleterious elements with major process impacts on the PMR. This paper will focus primarily on the roasting step and it will investigate the thermochemical and mineralogical changes occurring during roasting. These changes were evaluated through a combination of thermochemical modelling and experimental investigation. The roasting step needs to be in an oxidative environment in order to achieve the vapourisation of Se, Te, As, Os and S. The speciation of PGMs and their vapourisation behaviour are presented, as well as the sensitivity of precious metals deportment to changes in roast conditions. [URL]...|$|R

Protons contribute increasingly to transport with decreasing temperature in wet air, as confirmed by an H+/D+ isotope effect, representing the first observation of proton conductivity in this structure type.

Leakage of air into the furnace chamber results in <b>oxidising</b> <b>atmospheres</b> containing H 2 or O 2 and H 2 O. When the temperature is higher than 570 °C, a stable wüstite can form and rapid oxide scale formation results. Experiments were conducted on low carbon steel in wet nitrogen gas atmospheres in the temperature range 800 to 1200 °C. All measured oxidation kinetic rate constants were orders of magnitude smaller than theoretical predictions. The slow rates are partially due to the unbuffered nature of the gas. Well-controlled oxidation experiments were carried out on the low carbon steel {{in a series of}} N 2 -H 2 -H 2 O gas atmospheres at temperatures of 800 to 1200 °C, where wüstite is the only stable iron oxide product. With fixed pO 2 and temperature, according to Wagner's solid-state diffusion theory the parabolic rate constant should be fixed. However, kp values were much smaller than predicted, and kp increased with increasing pH 2 O. It is proposed that the mobile specie in solid-state diffusion is hydroxyl, and kp is proportional to pH 2 O 0. 5. With fixed pH 2 O and temperature, kp increased with increasing pO 2. At 900 °C, kp is proportional to pO 2 0. 4, but is proportional to pO 2 at 985 °C. Measured kp was much smaller than the predicted results. However, the dependence of kp on pO 2 was close to solid-state diffusion based theoretical prediction at both temperatures. Pure iron always reacts much faster than low carbon steel. Oxidation rate constants for iron were in good agreement with theoretical predictions. The slow steel kinetics could be due to its manganese content, leading to formation of an (FeMn) O solid solution. The mechanism is not clear. At the same temperature, kp values of low carbon steel oxidation were affected by both pH 2 O and pO 2. The relationship is described by kp=&# 945;pO 2 " 1 /n +&# 946;pH 2 O" 1 / 2, where n is a temperature dependent parameter, &# 945; and &# 946; are related to vacancy and hydroxyl permeability. The different values of &# 945; and &# 946; for the two materials account for the large differences in oxidation behaviour between pure iron and low carbon steel observed in reducing gas atmospheres. When low carbon steel and pure iron were oxidized in O 2 -H 2 O gas atmospheres, multi-layer scales developed. Low carbon steel and pure iron had similar kp values, always in reasonable agreement with Wagner's solid-state diffusion predictions...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of microstructural examinations of the industrial heat-resistant centrifugally cast GX 25 CrNiSi 18 - 9 steel characterised by increased content of Cu. The study included changes in the microstructure of base cast steel respective of the steel held at a temperature of 900 and 950 °C for 48 hours. Based on the results obtained, an increase in microhardness of the examined cast steel matrix with increasing temperature was stated, which was probably caused by fine precipitates enriched in Cr, Mo, and C forming inside the matrix grains. The layer of scale formed on the tested cast steel <b>oxidised</b> in the <b>atmosphere</b> of air at 900 and 950 °C was characterised by an increased tendency to degradation with increasing temperature of the conducted tests...|$|R
