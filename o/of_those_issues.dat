2500|$|Public {{relations}} {{officials for}} the Deseret Chemical Depot asserted {{at the time}} that during the 2001 disposal operations there were [...] "no problems". However, Eric Croddy reported in his 2005 book Weapons of Mass Destruction: An Encyclopedia of Worldwide Policy, Technology, and History that a number of issues came up during the destruction operations. One <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>issues,</b> that of leaking munitions, was an issue long before the weapons arrived at Deseret and the primary reason that Gov. Matheson and many Utah residents were opposed to the weapons transfer in the first place.|$|E
2500|$|Hence, [...] school {{teachers}} {{are part of}} the intelligentsia who recruit children in elementary school and teach them politics — to advocate for or to advocate against a public policy — as part of community-service projects; which political experience later assists them in earning admission to university. In that manner, the intellectuals of a society intervene and participate in social arenas of which they might not possess expert knowledge, and so unduly influence the formulation and realization of public policy. In the event, teaching political advocacy in elementary school encourages students to formulate opinions [...] "without any intellectual training or prior knowledge <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>issues,</b> making constraints against falsity few or non-existent." ...|$|E

On July 24, 2012, production was halted for ten days due to actor John Noble's treatment for a sleeping disorder in Los Angeles. According to Noble, he [...] "basically hit a wall" [...] after having struggled with insomnia and sleep apnea for years. [...] "I went to the hospital, had all the tests, and we put the strategies into place to deal with both <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>issues,</b> including the space-age mask that I wear to bed now," [...] he commented to Entertainment Weekly.

2500|$|On an April 13, 2012, {{appearance}} on Stossel, Palin {{explained that she}} disagreed with host John Stossel {{on the subject of}} drug legalization but reiterated her belief that the government should better prioritize drug laws: [...] "You take even more of a stronger libertarian view than I do on some <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>issues,</b> like the War on Drugs. I happen to believe that we need to continue to do all that we can to discourage drug use, especially with our youth. I would like to see, though, law enforcement prioritize its time and resources and not go out and bust a guy in his house, maybe smoking a joint, who's not doing anybody else any harm, and, in the meantime, go out and find the bad guys and you know, try to help keep society safe that way. Just prioritize; use common sense." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first story}} arc of The Fearless Defenders {{came to a}} close with issue #6 in July 2013. Bunn said, [...] "The first arc has {{definitely}} been very Asgardian.

Issues #7-#12, while they tell a complete story, we're going to do a series of done-in-one stories with those issues. Each <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>issues</b> will be pretty good jumping-on points for anybody." [...] Issue #6 also featured the death of Annabelle Riggs, who Newsarama called [...] "one of Marvel's few prominent lesbian characters", which drew a strong reaction from fans. In response Bunn wrote, [...] "the fact that she was a lesbian didn’t even enter the equation for me, except that it was part of what made her who she was — just one part of many" [...] with Pyle adding, [...] "I feel very strongly that her sacrifice was very true to everything we love about her. As to whether {{the fact that she is}} a lesbian should have kept us from telling a story in which she died… in this particular case, not having this specific character sacrifice herself would have made for a story in which we were less emotionally invested." ...|$|E
