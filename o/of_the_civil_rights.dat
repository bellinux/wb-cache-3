5|$|King {{organized}} and led marches for blacks' right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other basic civil rights.

5|$|By saying this, Kennedy was admonishing {{people not}} to riot in wake of King's death and in effect equating their actions to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> leader's assassin. After quoting Abraham Lincoln, he portrayed the American public as a people {{increasingly}} succumbing to its violent tendencies that undermined its national ideals. He argued that all deaths degraded American society, thereby assuming an uncompromising stance that any and all acts of violence were unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|Emmett Louis Till (July 25, 1941– August 28, 1955) was a 14-year-old African-American who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955, after a {{white woman}} said she was {{offended}} by him in her family's grocery store. The brutality of his murder {{and the fact that}} his killers were acquitted drew attention to the long history of violent persecution of African Americans in the United States. Till posthumously became an icon <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Movement.|$|E
5|$|After Speers' {{retirement}} in 1957, John Middaugh was minister from 1958 to 1968. Middaugh {{was a regular}} panelist for ten years on the weekly television program To Promote Goodwill, an interfaith discussion of social and religious issues produced by WBAL-TV and broadcast worldwide on the Voice of America. He {{was also in the}} forefront <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> movement in the early 1960s. Along with William Sloan Coffin and dozens of other clergymen and civil rights activists, Middaugh was arrested in a clash with police at Baltimore's Gwynn Oak Amusement Park in July 1963 over efforts to desegregate the popular attraction.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} Nation of Islam, MalcolmX {{announced}} {{his willingness to}} work with leaders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> movement, though he advocated some changes to their policies. He felt that calling the movement a struggle for civil rights would keep the issue within the United States, while changing the focus to human rights would make it an international concern. The movement could then bring its complaints before the United Nations, where MalcolmX said the emerging {{nations of the world}} would add their support.|$|E
5|$|Blackwell {{also served}} on the Democratic National Committee and as {{co-chairman}} of the Mississippi Democratic Party. The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party sent Blackwell and three other delegates to the 1964 Democratic National Convention in New Jersey. Their voices heard at the Convention helped contribute to the passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. In late 1982 Blackwell went to the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and received a Master's Degree in Regional Planning. Although Blackwell did not attend high school, the National Rural Fellows Program helped her gain admittance to the University of Massachusetts by awarding her a scholarship and providing her credit based on activism and life experience.|$|E
5|$|During Franklin's administration, Eleanor {{became an}} {{important}} connection to the African-American population {{in the era of}} segregation. Despite the President's desire to placate Southern sentiment, Eleanor was vocal in her support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> movement. After her experience with Arthurdale and her inspections of New Deal programs in Southern states, she concluded that New Deal programs were discriminating against African-Americans, who received a disproportionately small share of relief moneys. Eleanor became one of the only voices in the Roosevelt White House insisting that benefits be equally extended to Americans of all races.|$|E

5|$|In February 2013, the Michigan Department of Civil Rights (MDCR) filed a {{complaint}} with the US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). MDCR's complaint asserted that new research clearly establishes that use of American Indian imagery negatively impacts student learning, creating an unequal learning environment in violation of Article VI <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act of 1964. In June 2013, the OCR dismissed the case on the basis that the legal standard required not only harm, but the intent to do harm, which was not established.|$|E
5|$|Many {{whites and}} some blacks were alarmed by MalcolmX and the {{statements}} he made during this period. He and the Nation of Islam {{were described as}} hatemongers, black supremacists, racists, violence-seekers, segregationists, and a threat to improved race relations. He was accused of being antisemitic. One of the goals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> movement was to end disenfranchisement of African Americans, but the Nation of Islam forbade its members from participating in voting {{and other aspects of}} the political process. Civil rights organizations denounced him and the Nation as irresponsible extremists whose views did not represent African Americans.|$|E
5|$|On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks {{was arrested}} for refusing {{to give up her}} seat on a city bus. The Montgomery bus boycott, urged and planned by Nixon and led by King, soon followed. The boycott lasted for 385 days, and the {{situation}} became so tense that King's house was bombed. King was arrested during this campaign, which concluded with a United States District Court ruling in Browder v. Gayle that ended racial segregation on all Montgomery public buses. King's role in the bus boycott transformed him into a national figure and the best-known spokesman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> movement.|$|E

5|$|Regarded by {{many critics}} as Charles's best studio album, Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music has been {{considered}} by several music writers to be a landmark album in American music. The album's integration of soul and country music bent racial barriers in popular music, amid the height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Movement. In the process of recording the album, Charles {{became one of the}} first African-American musicians to exercise complete artistic control over his own recording career. The album has been called one of the greatest albums of all time by publications such as Rolling Stone and Time.|$|E
5|$|The Citizenship Clause {{overruled}} the Supreme Court's Dred Scott {{decision that}} black people were not citizens and could not become citizens, nor enjoy the benefits of citizenship. Some members of Congress voted for the Fourteenth Amendment in order to eliminate doubts about the constitutionality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act of 1866, or {{to ensure that no}} subsequent Congress could later repeal or alter the main provisions of that Act. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 had granted citizenship to all persons born in the United States if they were not subject to a foreign power, and this clause of the Fourteenth Amendment constitutionalized this rule.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Rights Movement gained congressional passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, {{eventually}} ending legal {{segregation and}} regaining effective suffrage for African Americans. But {{whites in the}} state {{had more than one}} way to reduce African Americans' voting power. Maintaining the city commission form of government with at-large voting resulted in all positions being elected by the white majority, as African Americans could not command a majority for their candidates in the informally segregated city.|$|E

5|$|The United States Cabinet has had 22 African-American {{appointed}} officers. The US Census Bureau defines African Americans {{as citizens}} or {{residents of the}} United States who have origins {{in any of the}} black populations of Africa. The term is generally used for Americans with at least partial ancestry in any of the original peoples of sub-Saharan Africa. During the founding of the federal government, African Americans were consigned to a status of second-class citizenship or enslaved. No African American ever held a Cabinet position before the Civil Rights Movement or the signing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act of 1964, which banned discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and labor unions.|$|E
5|$|The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a {{landmark}} piece of federal {{legislation in the}} United States that prohibits racial discrimination in voting. It {{was signed into law}} by President Lyndon B. Johnson during the height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Movement on August 6, 1965, and Congress later amended the Act five times to expand its protections. Designed to enforce the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Act secured voting rights for racial minorities throughout the country, especially in the South. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the Act is considered to be the most effective piece of federal civil rights legislation ever enacted in the country.|$|E
5|$|The author {{contrasts}} Regents of the University of California v. Bakke {{with the}} Supreme Court's 1971 decision in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., which ruled that employers {{did not have}} to willfully discriminate against employees to violate Title VII <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act of 1964. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote that certain standardized tests given by employers could be discriminatory, even if that was not the employer's intent. Another case discussed by Heins is the 1980 Supreme Court decision in Fullilove v. Klutznick, wherein the court ruled constitutional a federal law requiring a percentage of funds for a building project to be used for minority workers.|$|E
