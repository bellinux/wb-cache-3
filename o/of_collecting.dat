5|$|For the Muslims, {{the battle}} was a {{significant}} setback. Although they had been close to routing the Meccans a second time, their breach of Muhammad's orders in favor <b>of</b> <b>collecting</b> Meccan spoils reaped severe consequences. The two armies would meet again in AD 627 at the Battle of the Trench.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the player}} grows the Star Plant to 2000 metres and returns a seed to M.O.M., the main {{objective}} is completed, and the player {{is given the}} choice <b>of</b> <b>collecting</b> eight more seeds.

5|$|Both Braathens SAFE and SAS {{had been}} cross-subsidizing their routes. Through the regulations, the {{airlines}} {{had agreed to}} fly to unprofitable airports, in exchange for making higher profits on other routes. With free competition, {{this would not be}} followed, and the authorities announced the introduction of public service obligations on routes that were not profitable. To finance these, a NOK10 fee would be charged on all primary routes. The cost <b>of</b> <b>collecting</b> this fee was so high that SAS and Braathens SAFE announced it was cheaper to continue to fly to the unprofitable airports. Braathens SAFE stated that their routes Haugesund–Bergen and Oslo–Røros–Trondheim were not profitable.|$|E

5|$|Figures from WRAP {{revealed}} {{the most efficient}} method <b>of</b> <b>collecting</b> food waste to be separate collections, followed by mixed green and food waste on a weekly basis. A mixed fortnightly collection was shown {{to be the worst}} performing. This was considered confirmation of earlier suspicions that, if carried out correctly, separate collections can result in less wastage of biodegradable waste. A widespread pilot scheme for separate food waste collection, involving nineteen English local authorities, achieved success and 'high levels of satisfaction' from households.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Beebe {{returned}} to Nova Scotia {{on his first}} expedition for the zoo, with the goal <b>of</b> <b>collecting</b> marine animals by searching tide pools and with additional dredging. The following year he was promoted from assistant curator {{to the rank of}} full curator, a post he held until 1918. He then went on to serve as an honorary curator from 1919 to 1962.|$|E

Stone, Spencer's father, {{as well as}} {{two other}} men, were indicted on charges <b>of</b> <b>collecting</b> $1.5 million USD in {{insurance}} money in an arson and insurance fraud scheme, which resulted in setting fires at Sacramento-area commercial buildings. Stone's father allegedly provided business services, including assisting with insurance claims after seven fires in Sacramento and Carmichael, California, between 2009 and 2013. He was charged with 13 counts of mail or wire fraud. Stone currently lives in Sacramento as of 2016 and is a Christian.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the conceptual framework several additional factors enabled the GWA studies. One was the advent of biobanks, which are repositories of human genetic material that greatly reduced the cost and difficulty <b>of</b> <b>collecting</b> sufficient numbers of biological specimens for study. Another was the International HapMap Project, which, from 2003 identified {{a majority of the}} common SNPs interrogated in a GWA study. The haploblock structure identified by HapMap project also allowed the focus on the subset of SNPs that would describe most of the variation. Also the development of the methods to genotype all these SNPs using genotyping arrays was an important prerequisite.|$|E

Termite alates are high in nutrition with adequate levels of fat and protein. They are regarded as pleasant in taste, having a nut-like flavour after they are cooked.|$|E

5|$|The breed gained {{official}} {{recognition from}} the Canadian Kennel Club in January 1980 {{after five years}} <b>of</b> <b>collecting</b> pedigrees, gathering support, and lobbying officials by two breeders and enthusiasts. The small number of Australian Cattle Dogs in Canada {{at the time were}} primarily working dogs on farms and ranches scattered across large distances. However, the fledgling breed club held conformation shows, obedience and agility competitions, and entered their dogs in sports including flyball and lure coursing. At the end of 1980, Landmaster Carina was named the first Australian Cattle Dog in Canada to gain both her conformation and obedience titles.|$|E
5|$|After Urilla's death, Wyatt {{went through}} a {{downward}} spiral and {{had a series of}} legal problems. On March 14, 1871, Barton County filed a lawsuit against Earp and his sureties. Earp was in charge <b>of</b> <b>collecting</b> license fees for Lamar, which funded local schools, and he was accused of failing to turn in the fees. On March 31, James Cromwell filed a lawsuit against Earp, alleging that Earp had falsified court documents about the amount of money collected from Cromwell to satisfy a judgment. To make up the difference between what Earp turned in and Cromwell owed (which he claimed to have paid), the court seized Cromwell's mowing machine and sold it for $38. Cromwell's suit claimed that Earp owed him $75, the estimated value of the machine.|$|E
5|$|Choosing {{to support}} a Reason {{will result in a}} {{different}} ending depending on who is chosen, but in each the world is reborn {{in the image of the}} chosen Reason after the Demi-fiend fights Kagutsuchi to prove his resolve. Chiaki and Isamu die before the Demi-fiend begins and give him their blessing in spirit form, while Hikawa accompanies the Demi-fiend into their new world. If Takao's wishes are followed, the Demi-fiend fights Kagutsuchi and the world is returned to its pre-Conception state, resurrecting and restoring all the main characters. If the Demi-fiend rejects Takao's wishes, Kagutsuchi curses him for allowing the world to die and departs, leaving the Demi-fiend as the only survivor in a barren world of demons, trapped as it is until another Conception can happen. If the Demi-fiend fulfills Lucifer's request <b>of</b> <b>collecting</b> the Candelabra from the Fiends, Kagutsuchi attacks him and is destroyed, breaking the Great Will's control over the worlds. After this, Lucifer fights the Demi-fiend to test his strength, then declares him to be the ultimate weapon in the upcoming war against the Great Will.|$|E

5|$|Despite its {{similarities}} {{however, the}} gameplay offered many new changes. Instead <b>of</b> <b>collecting</b> four Jet Pods, the player-character must rescue four MuuMuus in each level before exiting. Another new addition {{is the new}} interface, which displays one of Robbit's travelling AI companions, a health bar, a timer and a jump-meter that displays {{whether or not the}} player is eligible for a triple jump. Other new additions include the power orbs as an added power-up and the ability to obtain Performance Medals. A certain Performance Medal may be awarded depending on how the player completes a level. For example, playing through a single level without firing any weapons will reward the player with the Flower Child medal. There are a total of twelve medals to collect.|$|E
5|$|George Pickingill {{was the son}} of Charles Pickingill, a {{labourer}} and blacksmith, and Susannah Cudner, a {{woman who}} also went by the name of Hannah Cudmore; the couple had married on 17 September 1813. Although he had no known birth record, according to parish records, George Pickingill was baptised on 26 May 1816 at the church in Hockley. The year of Pickingill's birth is however in question, as he made differing claims in different censuses; in the 1851 census, he claimed to be 26, meaning that his birth would have occurred circa 1825, while in the 1861 census, he claimed to be 46, which would have placed his birth c.1815. By the time of the 1901 census, he was claiming to be 95, moving his birth to c.1806; {{it has been suggested that}} he made himself appear older to ease the process <b>of</b> <b>collecting</b> parish assistance from the church. Throughout his life, Pickingill would also use a variety of different spellings of his surname on official records, including Pickengill, Pickingale, Pickengal, Pettingale, Pitengale, and Pittengale.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{emergence}} of the ice trade of the 19th century, snow and ice had been collected and stored to use in the summer months {{in various parts of the}} world, but never on a large scale. In the Mediterranean and in South America, for example, there was a long history <b>of</b> <b>collecting</b> ice from the upper slopes of the Alps and the Andes during the summer months and traders transporting this down into the cities. Similar trading practices had grown up in Mexico during the colonial period. The Russians collected ice along the Neva River during the winter months for consumption in Saint Petersburg for many years. Wealthy Europeans began to build ice houses to store ice gathered on their local estates during the winter from the 16th century onwards; the ice was used to cool drinks or food for the wealthiest elites.|$|E

5|$|Websites such as Equestria Daily and Ponychan {{were created}} for fans to share artwork, stories, music, and {{news about the}} show. Founded in January 2011, Equestria Daily had over 36 million pageviews in its first 9 months, and has since surpassed 500 million views (June 2014). The blog, which {{receives}} more than 175,000 visits a day and is fully funded by advertising revenue, was established by 23-year-old college student Shaun Scotellaro for the purpose <b>of</b> <b>collecting</b> fan fiction and news specific to Friendship Is Magic. Shaun eventually cut back on his community college classes {{in order to continue}} running the site out of his parents' house in Glendale, Arizona, when it grew in popularity.

5|$|When {{the park}} first opened in 2004, Metra police stopped a Columbia College Chicago journalism {{student who was}} working on a {{photography}} project in Millennium Park and confiscated his film because of fears of terrorism. In 2005, the sculpture attracted some controversy when a professional photographer without a paid permit was denied access to the piece. As is the case for all works of art currently covered by United States copyright law, the artist holds the copyright for the sculpture. This allows the public to freely photograph Cloud Gate, but permission from Kapoor or the City of Chicago (which has licensed the art) is required for any commercial reproductions of the photographs. The city first set a policy <b>of</b> <b>collecting</b> permit fees for photographs. These permits were initially set at $350 per day for professional still photographers, $1,200 per day for professional videographers and $50 per hour for wedding photographers. The policy has been changed so permits are only required for large-scale film, video and photography requiring ten-person crews and equipment.|$|E
5|$|While {{attending}} Columbia, Beebe persuaded his {{professors to}} sponsor him and several fellow students taking research trips to Nova Scotia, where {{he continued his}} hobby <b>of</b> <b>collecting,</b> as well as attempting to photograph difficult-to-observe scenes of birds and other animals. Several of Beebe's photographs from these expeditions were purchased by Columbia professors to use as slides during their lectures. During these trips Beebe also developed an interest in dredging, the practice of using nets to haul up animals that lived deep underwater, and attempting to study them before they died or disintegrated. Beebe never applied to receive a degree from Columbia, although years later he was granted honorary doctorates from both Tufts and Colgate University.|$|E
