5|$|In {{order of}} area planted, the arable crops grown in Wales were: foods for stock-feeding, spring barley, wheat, maize, winter barley, other cereals for combining, <b>oilseed</b> <b>rape,</b> {{potatoes}} and other crops. The grassland was predominantly permanent pasture, with only 10% of the grassland being under five years old. Compared with {{other parts of}} the United Kingdom, Wales has the smallest percentage of arable land (6%), and a considerably smaller area of rough grazing and hill land than Scotland (27% against 62%).|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of agriculture in Suffolk is either arable or mixed. Farm sizes vary from anything around 80 acres (32 hectares) to over 8,000. Soil types vary from heavy clays to light sands. Crops grown include:winter wheat, winter barley, sugar beet, <b>oilseed</b> <b>rape,</b> {{winter and spring}} beans and linseed, although smaller areas of rye and oats can be found growing in areas with lighter soils along {{with a variety of}} vegetables.|$|E
25|$|Lincolnshire is an {{agricultural}} area, growing {{large amounts of}} wheat, barley, sugar beet, and <b>oilseed</b> <b>rape.</b> In South Lincolnshire, where the soil is particularly rich in nutrients, {{some of the most}} common crops include potatoes, cabbages, cauliflowers, and onions. South Lincolnshire is also home to one of the UK's leading agricultural experiment stations located in Sutton Bridge operated by the Potato Council, Sutton Bridge Crop Storage Research engages in research for the British potato industry.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th {{century the}} county {{developed}} {{a role in}} aviation. The first development in airfields came with the First World War; there was then a massive expansion during the Second World War {{with the growth of}} the Royal Air Force and the influx of the American USAAF 8th Air Force which operated from many Norfolk airfields. During the Second World War agriculture rapidly intensified, and it has remained very intensive since, with the establishment of large fields for growing cereals and <b>oilseed</b> <b>rape.</b>|$|E
25|$|One {{possible}} {{environmental factor}} in the food price crisis is rising background levels of ground-level tropospheric ozone in the atmosphere. Plants {{have been shown to}} have a high sensitivity to ozone levels, and lower yields of important food crops, such as wheat and soybeans, may have been a result of elevated ozone levels. Ozone levels in the Yangtze Delta were studied for their effect on <b>oilseed</b> <b>rape,</b> a member of the cabbage family that produces one-third of the vegetable oil used in China. Plants grown in chambers that controlled ozone levels exhibited a 10–20 percent reduction in size and weight (biomass) when exposed to elevated ozone levels. Production of seeds and oil was also reduced. The Chinese authors of this study also reported that rice grown in chambers that controlled ozone levels exhibited a 14 to 20 percent reduction in biomass yield when exposed to ozone levels over 25 times higher than was normal for the region.|$|E
500|$|Biofuel {{development}} and use is a complex issue {{because there are many}} biofuel options which are available. [...] Biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, are currently produced from the products of conventional food crops such as the starch, sugar and oil feedstocks from crops that include wheat, maize, sugar cane, palm oil and <b>oilseed</b> <b>rape.</b> Some researchers fear that a major switch to biofuels from such crops would create a direct competition with their use for food and animal feed, and claim that {{in some parts of the}} world the economic consequences are already visible, other researchers look at the land available and the enormous areas of idle and abandoned land and claim that there is room for a large proportion of biofuel also from conventional crops.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, several peer-reviewed {{independent}} {{studies were}} published showing that neonicotinoids had previously undetected routes of exposure affecting bees including through dust, pollen, and nectar and that subnanogram toxicity resulted in failure {{to return to}} the hive without immediate lethality, one primary symptom of CCD. Research also showed environmental persistence in agricultural irrigation channels and soil. These reports prompted a formal peer review by the European Food Safety Authority, which stated in January 2013 that some neonicotinoids pose an unacceptably high risk to bees, and identified several data gaps not previously considered. Their review concluded, [...] "A high acute risk to honey bees was identified from exposure via dust drift for the seed treatment uses in maize, <b>oilseed</b> <b>rape</b> and cereals. A high acute risk was also identified from exposure via residues in nectar and/or pollen." [...] Dave Goulson, an author of one of the studies that prompted the EFSA review, has suggested that industry science pertaining to neonicotinoids may have been deliberately deceptive, and the UK Parliament has asked manufacturer Bayer Cropscience to explain discrepancies in evidence they have submitted to an investigation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of agriculture around Clare is arable.

2500|$|Agricultural {{use of the}} moors {{is shared}} with grouse {{shooting}} {{as a means of}} gaining financial return from the vast expanse of [...] heather. There is richer farmland across the southern limestone belt, where there are arable and mixed farms as well as the livestock farms. The main arable crops are barley, wheat, <b>oilseed</b> <b>rape,</b> potatoes, and sugar beets. There is also some intensive production of pigs and poultry.|$|E
2500|$|Biofuel crops {{grown in}} the UK include <b>oilseed</b> <b>rape</b> (which is also grown for other purposes), short-rotation coppices such as poplar or willow, and miscanthus. [...] Unfortunately {{biofuels}} are quite bulky for their energy yield, which means processing into fuel needs to happen near where the crop is grown; otherwise, {{most or all of}} the benefit of biofuels can be lost in transporting the biofuel to the processing area. [...] Such local processing units are not generally available in the UK, and further expansion of this market will depend on politics and industrial finance.|$|E
