5|$|A major {{corrective}} opportunity {{this year}} involved the rerelease {{of one of}} the earliest malicious biographies of Mrs. Eddy, The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science by Georgine Milmine. Dating from the yellow journalism period, this book was published in an attempt to discredit her. The current publisher, after much correspondence with <b>our</b> <b>office,</b> instead issued a statement accurately characterizing its bias. The book has received almost no attention in the public, proving if Truth isn't spoken, nothing is said.|$|E
25|$|However, nouns of {{this type}} which are proper nouns (particularly names of people) form their plurals by simply adding -s: the two Kennedys, there are three Harrys in <b>our</b> <b>office.</b> With place names this rule is not always adhered to: Germanys and Germanies are both used, and Sicilies and Scillies are the {{standard}} plurals of Sicily and Scilly. Nor does the rule apply to words that are merely capitalized common nouns: P Ferries (from ferry).|$|E
500|$|Although Drymon had a {{significant}} influence on SpongeBob SquarePants, he was not initially offered a role on the series. As a late recruit to Rocko's Modern Life, he had not established much of a relationship with Hillenburg before SpongeBobs conception. Hillenburg first sought out Drymon's storyboard partner, Mark O'Hare - but O'Hare had just created the soon-to-be syndicated comic strip, Citizen Dog, and while he would later join SpongeBob as a writer, lacked {{the time to get}} involved with both projects at the outset. Drymon has said, [...] "I remember Hillenburg's bringing it up to Mark in <b>our</b> <b>office</b> and asking him if he'd be interested in working on it...I was all ready to say yes to the offer, but Steve didn't ask; he just left the room. I was pretty desperate...so I ran into the hall after him and basically begged him for the job. He didn't jump at the chance." [...] Once Hillenburg had given it some thought and decided to bring Drymon on as creative director, the two began meeting at Hillenburg's house multiple times a week to develop the series. Drymon has identified this period as having begun in 1996, shortly after the end of Rocko's Modern Life.|$|E

Walker said [...] "Several people in <b>our</b> <b>office</b> decided to start a newsletter. It sort of expanded throughout our company and throughout our building." [...] It had been published for 14 years. In 1991 the business had paid off its debts.

2500|$|Evangelical {{organisation}} Andrew Wommack Ministries declared {{support for}} the bill. [...] "I knew this information was wrong and the punishments were vastly exaggerated as is so often the case. I met with the member of parliament responsible for this bill {{and he gave me}} his reasoning for introducing this legislation. Uganda had just had the United Nations try to pressure them into passing pro-homosexual legislation in order to obtain a large sum of money offered to them (a bribe). They responded with this legislation in order to stop the strong arm tactics of the pro-homosexual western influence. Would to God American leaders had enough integrity to not be bribed or badgered into compliance. Although I knew the situation was being misrepresented, I didn't feel qualified to deal with this personally. But Leland Shores who runs <b>our</b> <b>office</b> in Kampala, Uganda is well aware of the details and has written a response worthy of everyone who has an interest in this reading. He has included a letter from over 200 Ugandan Christian leaders explaining the situation." ...|$|E

[...] The network also said, [...] "Our goal with the Super Bowl Halftime show was to produce an entertaining stage experience with a positive message about empowerment and voting. We are disappointed that this message has been overshadowed by the unfortunate incident". A statement from CBS read, [...] "We attended all rehearsals throughout the week and there was no indication that any such thing would happen. The moment did not conform to CBS broadcast standards and we would like to apologize to anyone who was offended." [...] Viacom President Mel Karmazin said that while the company can be proud of 99% of what people saw on the broadcast, it understands [...] "what a difference one percent can make". NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the show produced by MTV, which like CBS, was owned by Viacom at the time (before the two networks were respectively separated into Viacom and CBS Corporation, both controlled by National Amusements, in December 2005), fell far short of the [...] "tasteful, first-class entertainment" [...] the league expected. FCC Commissioner Michael Powell, appearing before a Senate panel, called the Super Bowl incident [...] "a new low for prime time television". Joe Browne, Executive Vice President of the NFL, said, [...] "We were extremely disappointed by elements of the MTV-produced Halftime show. They were totally inconsistent with assurances <b>our</b> <b>office</b> was given about the show. It's unlikely that MTV will produce another Super Bowl halftime." [...] An hour-long MTV documentary titled [...] "Making the Super Bowl Halftime Show" [...] was scheduled to premiere the following week but was canceled before it ever aired and has never been broadcast subsequently.|$|E
