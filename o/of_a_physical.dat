5|$|Noether's theorem {{has become}} a {{fundamental}} tool of modern theoretical physics, both because of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also, as a practical calculation tool. Her theorem allows researchers to determine the conserved quantities from the observed symmetries <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> system. Conversely, it facilitates the description <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> system based on classes of hypothetical physical laws. For illustration, suppose that a new physical phenomenon is discovered. Noether's theorem provides a test for theoretical models of the phenomenon: if the theory has a continuous symmetry, then Noether's theorem guarantees that the theory has a conserved quantity, and for the theory to be correct, this conservation must be observable in experiments.|$|E
5|$|Series creator Masashi Kishimoto had likened Guy's passionate {{personality}} to that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> education teacher {{he had in}} junior high school, but notes that the teacher was not a model for Guy's character. In the Japanese anime, his voice actor is Masashi Ebara (who also voices Guy's father, Duy), with Masayuki Makiguchi voicing him as a child. In the English anime, Guy is voiced by Skip Stellrecht (except in Rock Lee and his Ninja Pals, where he is voiced by Matthew Mercer), with Todd Haberkorn voicing him as a child.|$|E
5|$|In 1887 Michelson {{proposed}} {{the use of}} optical interferometers for the measurement of length, work which contributed to him being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1907. In 1952 the CIPM {{proposed the}} use of wavelength of a specific light source as the standard for defining length, and in 1960 the CGPM accepted this proposal using radiation corresponding to a transition between specified energy levels of the krypton 86 atom as the new standard for the metre. By 1975, when the second had been defined in terms <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> phenomenon rather than the earth's rotation and Einstein's assertion that {{the speed of light}} was constant, the CGPM authorised the CIPM to investigate the use of the speed of light {{as the basis for the}} definition of the metre. This proposal was accepted in 1983.|$|E

5|$|The {{basic form}} of the apothecaries' system is {{essentially}} {{a subset of the}} Roman weight system. An apothecaries' pound normally consisted of 12 ounces. (In France this was changed to 16 ounces, and in Spain the customary unit was the marco, a mark of 8 ounces.) In the south of Europe and in France, the scruple was generally divided into 24 grains, so that one ounce consisted of 576 grains. Nevertheless, the subdivision of an ounce was somewhat more uniform than that of a pound, and a common feature of all variants is that 12 ounces are roughly 100 drachms (96–128 drachms) and a grain is roughly the weight <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> grain.|$|E
5|$|The Steam store also enables {{users to}} redeem store product keys to add {{software}} from their library. The keys are sold by third-party providers such as Humble Bundle (in which {{a portion of}} the sale is given back to the publisher or distributor), distributed as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> release to redeem the game, or given to a user as part of promotions, often used to deliver Kickstarter and other crowd funding rewards. A grey market exists around Steam keys, where less reputable buyers purchase a large number of Steam keys for a game when it is offered for a low cost, and then resell these keys to users or other third-party sites at a higher price, generating profit for themselves. This caused some of these third-party sites, like G2A, to be embroiled in this grey market. It is possible for publishers to have Valve to track down where specific keys have been used and cancel them, removing the product from the user's libraries, leaving the user to seek any recourse with the third-party they purchased from. Other legitimate storefronts, like Humble Bundle, have set a minimum price that must be spent to obtain Steam keys as to discourage mass purchases that would enter the grey market.|$|E

40|$|Although it {{is often}} {{performed}} in clinical practice, the diagnostic value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> screening <b>physical</b> examination to detect maltreatment in children without prior suspicion has not been reviewed. This article aims to evaluate the diagnostic value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> complete <b>physical</b> examination as <b>a</b> screening instrument to detect maltreatment in children without prior suspicion. We systematically searched the databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, and ERIC, using a sensitive search strategy. Studies that i) presented medical findings <b>of</b> <b>a</b> complete <b>physical</b> examination for screening purposes in children 0 - 18 years, ii) specifically recorded {{the presence or absence}} of signs of child maltreatment, and iii) recorded child maltreatment confirmed by a reference standard, were included. Two reviewers independently performed study selection, data extraction, and quality appraisal using the QUADAS- 2 tool. The search yielded 4, 499 titles, of which three studies met the eligibility criteria. The prevalence of confirmed signs of maltreatment during screening physical examination varied between 0. 8 % and 13. 5 %. The designs of the studies were inadequate to assess the diagnostic accuracy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> screening <b>physical</b> examination for child maltreatment. Because of the lack of informative studies, we could not draw conclusions about the diagnostic value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> screening <b>physical</b> examination in children without prior suspicion of child maltreatmen...|$|R

25|$|In {{mathematical}} physics, equations {{of motion}} are equations that describe the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> system {{in terms of its}} motion as a function of time. More specifically, the {{equations of motion}} describe the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> system as a set of mathematical functions in terms of dynamic variables: normally spatial coordinates and time are used, but others are also possible, such as momentum components and time. The most general choice are generalized coordinates which can be any convenient variables characteristic of the physical system. The functions are defined in a Euclidean space in classical mechanics, but are replaced by curved spaces in relativity. If the dynamics of a system is known, the equations are the solutions to the differential equations describing the motion of the dynamics.|$|E
