5|$|Internal realism was {{the view}} that, {{although}} {{the world may}} be causally independent of the human mind, {{the structure of the}} world—its division into kinds, individuals and categories—is a function of the human mind, and hence the world is not ontologically independent. The general idea is influenced by Kant's idea of the dependence of our knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>on</b> the categories of thought.|$|E

5|$|Atlas– A four-armed Titan who {{was imprisoned}} in Tartarus after the Great War. In Chains of Olympus, Atlas was freed by the goddess Persephone and {{captured}} the god Helios on her behalf. Persephone directed Atlas to use Helios' power {{to destroy the}} Pillar of the World. Atlas, however, was chained to the weakened pillar by Kratos, and was doomed to carry the weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>on</b> his shoulders forever. After Kratos defeated Persephone, Atlas mocked Kratos and his choice to defend the gods. In God of War II, Atlas and Kratos met again, and although he was initially bitter towards Kratos, Atlas decided to help him reach the Sisters of Fate, providing him with the magic, Atlas Quake, and stated that they would meet again. This would be Atlas' final appearance, however, leaving his fate unknown. The character was voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan in God of War II, and Fred Tatasciore in Chains of Olympus.|$|E

5|$|After {{locating}} the Temple of Persephone and confronting the Queen of the Underworld, Kratos {{is given a}} choice: renounce his power and be with his deceased daughter (at a cost to mankind) or proceed with his mission. Kratos sacrifices his weapons and power {{to be reunited with}} his daughter, but discovers that Persephone is embittered by Zeus' betrayal and her imprisonment in the Underworld with her husband Hades. While he was distracted by his reunion with Calliope, Persephone's ally Atlas was using the power of the kidnapped Helios to destroy the Pillar of the World, which would also end Olympus. Choosing to abandon Calliope forever, Kratos takes back his power and binds Atlas to the Pillar of the World he sought to destroy, forcing the Titan to hold the weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>on</b> his shoulders. Kratos then battles Persephone to the death. Although victorious, he is warned by a dying Persephone that his suffering will never end. Atlas also warns Kratos that he will eventually regret helping the gods and that he and Atlas will meet again. Kratos then rides the Sun Chariot back to the mortal world and into the sky as Morpheus retreats.|$|E
