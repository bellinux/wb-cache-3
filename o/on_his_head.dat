As they terrorised the Azores, the pressure increased from the authorities, who by then had taken special notice of Low, despite the hordes of pirates in operation at the time.|$|E

5|$|Captain Blackadder's trench {{receives}} {{a phone call}} from HQ: a full-scale attack has been ordered for the next day at dawn.

His plan is thwarted when General Melchett arrives to see what is happening and remarks that he shot an entire platoon that used this exact method; Blackadder overhears and narrowly escapes Melchett's punishment by pretending he is relating the story to Baldrick.|$|E
5|$|Dr Sadiq Alekry, a 44-year-old plastic surgeon, voluntarily {{offered his}} {{services}} at the roundabout {{on the evening of}} 16February, shortly after he had returned from Houston.

5|$|He re-invented the {{practice}} of stiff-arming his tacklers, which {{had gone out of}} favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in the end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his knees were minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.|$|E
