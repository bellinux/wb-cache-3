5|$|During the screening, {{the court}} heard that Muhammad had {{raised his hand}} to his {{forehead}} and moved his leg after the cameraman had said he was dead, {{and that there was no}} blood <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt.</b> Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not said the boy was dead, but that he was dying. A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said that had the shots come from the Israeli position, Muhammad would have been hit in the lower limbs only.|$|E
5|$|Four of {{the first}} five runs were leg byes; Miller then removed Washbrook for one from a top-edged hook shot that was caught by Tallon. The batsman was displeased with the umpire's {{decision}} and gestured to a red mark <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt,</b> indicating he felt the ball had touched his body and not the bat. Edrich came in and while he continued to struggle, he defiantly held up {{his end of the}} pitch. After scoring 13 from 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind attempting a cut from the off spin of Johnson. He did not read the arm ball, which went straight on and took the outside edge, leaving England 39/2. Johnson was extracting a substantial amount of spin from the surface.|$|E
5|$|Massive Dynamic {{executive}} Mark Young (Ptolemy Slocum) {{delivers a}} {{presentation at the}} company’s Manhattan office. When he is done and the other attendees have left, he sees an unusual butterfly. Upon picking it up, he experiences a cut on his hand and is then attacked by a swarm. Mark jumps out of a window, to his death. Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), despite preparing {{to go out to}} dinner with her sister, instead agrees to Phillip Broyles' (Lance Reddick) demand that she join the Fringe team's investigation at the scene. While examining the body, Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) sees lacerations on Young’s skin and notes a lack of corresponding tears <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt.</b> At the scene, Olivia has a brief vision of her deceased lover John Scott (Mark Valley) watching them, which troubles her.|$|E

5|$|On {{the second}} day, Miller {{came in at}} 2/121—O'Reilly {{believed}} that Bradman was trying to force the pace and had promoted Miller above Lindsay Hassett, the usual number four batsman—and was dismissed for a duck; he failed to pick Laker's arm ball, which went straight on instead of turning in, clipped the outside edge and was taken at slip by Edrich. After Australia finished at 509 {{on the third day}} to take a 344-run lead, Miller opened the bowling with Johnston—Lindwall was injured while bowling in the first innings and was unable to take to the field. Miller removed Washbrook for one, caught behind by Tallon from a top-edged hook shot. Washbrook was displeased with the decision and gestured to a red mark <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt,</b> indicating his opinion that the ball hit his clothing rather than the bat.|$|E
5|$|The agents {{call the}} police, who take Mulder with them {{due to the}} circumstantial {{evidence}} against him. Scully performs an autopsy on Amy Cassandra, finding a scab on her forehead. The detective {{in charge of the}} case tells Mulder that they have found David and Amy's blood <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt.</b> Mulder refuses to confess to the murders, not remembering anything. Scully arrives, saying she found in Amy's blood traces of ketamine, an anesthesic substance that has hallucinogenic properties. The substance was detected in Mulder's blood as well. Meanwhile, one of the officers at the station kills himself; he has similar symptoms to that of the Cassandras. Mulder suffers a seizure and flashes back to his childhood again, witnessing his parents arguing with The Smoking Man. Scully sees Mulder the next day, telling him that she believes that the Cassandras killed themselves after receiving psychiatric treatment and that Mulder was visiting them about their alien abduction experiences.|$|E
25|$|Mickey Dugan, {{better known}} as The Yellow Kid, was a bald, snaggle-toothed barefoot boy who wore an {{oversized}} yellow nightshirt and hung around in a slum alley typical of certain areas of squalor that existed in late 19th-century New York City. Hogan's Alley was filled with equally odd characters, mostly other children. With a goofy grin, the Kid habitually spoke in a ragged, peculiar slang, which was printed <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt,</b> a device meant to lampoon advertising billboards.|$|E

25|$|When John Nathan-Turner {{became the}} show's {{producer}} in Baker's last year, the Fourth Doctor {{was the first}} to sport an item of clothing adorned with question marks as a motif, in this case, above the points <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> collars. His overall costume was redesigned, changing the colour focus from brown to red. Designer June Hudson later revealed in an interview that Nathan-Turner had even given her permission to remove the scarf altogether if she wanted to. Hudson opted to keep the scarf, as it was such an iconic part of the character.|$|E
25|$|Essien {{made his}} debut as a second-half {{substitute}} against Arsenal on 21 August 2005, wearing the number 5 <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt.</b> The match {{ended in a}} 1–0 victory to Chelsea. He made an assist in his full debut against West Bromwich Albion, and he replaced the injured Claude Makélélé in the defensive midfield role against Sunderland in the 2–0 win on 10 September 2005. He soon cemented his place in José Mourinho's side, starting in 31 domestic league matches, as well as 11 appearances in other cup competitions.|$|E
25|$|In May 2005 he {{was handed}} his first call-up to the England senior squad by manager Sven-Göran Eriksson for the team's {{tour of the}} United States, making his debut against Colombia. He went on to make two {{appearances}} during the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign for England: starting against Austria in a 1–0 victory and coming on as a substitute against Poland in a 2–1 win. In the latter appearance, Crouch's introduction as a second-half substitute was booed by England's own supporters. On 1 March 2006, he scored his first goal for England, with the equaliser in a 2–1 friendly win over Uruguay. He did this whilst bizarrely wearing two different squad numbers <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> – No.21 on the front (his designated squad number for the match), and the incorrect No.12 on the back.|$|E

25|$|Leeds' relegation in May 2004 saw Smith {{kissing the}} badge <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> and crying at {{what would be}} his last match for the club. His {{transfer}} to bitter rivals Manchester United, however, led to controversy. His exit was marred by accusations of treachery, and {{in the space of a}} day he went from hero to villain in the eyes of some Leeds fans; this was despite the fact that club had publicly stated that they could not afford to pay his wages, that they were open to offers for him, and that no other club had registered an interest. Due to the financial difficulties at Leeds, Smith chose to waive the personal transfer fee owed to him by the club. This did not stop some Leeds fans from feeling betrayed, and they held up banners in subsequent games that compared Smith to Judas.|$|E
25|$|In the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Ronaldo {{played with}} the name Ronaldinho <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt,</b> since centre back Ronaldo Guiaro, two years his senior, {{was one of his}} teammates.

Ronaldo also {{represented}} Brazil in the 1995 Copa América (finishing in second place), and won both the 1997 and the 1999 editions of the tournament, finishing as top scorer in 1999. He was the second highest scorer of the tournament in 1997 and was elected the best player of the Copa América. He also took part in the friendly Tournoi de France in 1997, preceding the 1998 FIFA World Cup, scoring a goal as Brazil finished in second place. Ronaldo starred alongside Romário, dubbed the Ro-Ro attack, in the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup, helping Brazil win their first ever Confederations Cup title where he finished as the third highest scorer with 4 goals, scoring a hat-trick over Australia in the final.|$|E
25|$|Majstorović {{was also}} vice-captain at Basel {{and led the}} team out {{whenever}} Ivan Ergić was not playing. Majstorović had an excellent scoring record at Basel, averaging nearly one goal every seven games. He regularly lingered in the opposition's penalty area when attacking corners and due to his great heading ability, he usually converted high balls {{into the back of}} the net. He is also a spot-kick specialist and scored the winner for Basel in the 2007 Swiss Cup final by netting from the penalty spot in the 93rd minute. He showed his love for Basel and their passionate fans by kissing the badge <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> as his goal celebration. At the end of the 2007–08 season, he was Basel's second top goal-scorer with 10 goals, behind 12-goal Marco Streller. The explanation for his many goals is because during his time with Basel, Majstorović became the club's first choice penalty taker. In January 2008, he was set to move to Turkish club Trabzonspor but the move fell through.|$|E

2500|$|Hussey has the {{nickname}} Mr Cricket, {{due to his}} encyclopaedic knowledge of his sport. He has repeatedly stated that he dislikes {{the nickname}} finding it [...] "a bit embarrassing". England rival Andrew Flintoff and Graeme Swann's brother Alec were reportedly responsible for coining it.

During the 2007 Twenty20 against England, however, he was seen with [...] "Huss" [...] <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> instead, further suggesting he is fed up with the tag Mr Cricket. Nevertheless, the nickname features prominently in his television ads for the national real estate chain L.J. Hooker.|$|E

2500|$|The 2007–08 {{season was}} just as successful, {{culminating}} in another ACC regular season and tournament championship.

2500|$|On 25 August 2009, it was {{revealed}} that contact between Celtic and FC Seoul had occurred regarding the possibility of Ki's transfer to the Parkhead club. However, the player's agent stated an immediate move would be unlikely given Seoul's success in the league and the Asian Champions League. Yet, three days later, Celtic clinched a £2.1million transfer for Ki. He linked up with the Parkhead side in the January transfer window {{at the end of the}} K-League season. The signing was confirmed on 13 December 2009 after Ki passed a medical and secured a work permit. Ki reportedly turned down an offer from English club Portsmouth, then of the Premier League. He took the number 18 with [...] "Ki" [...] <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt.</b> He made his debut for Celtic in a 1–1 draw against [...] Falkirk at Celtic Park on 16 January 2010, winning the Man of the Match award from the official Celtic website.

2500|$|In May 1942, when Gen.

It was with the sickest of feelings that I gave the white-flag-raising order to Colonel Paul D. Bunker." [...] Instead of burning the entire flag, Bunker cut off a piece and concealed it under a patch <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt.</b> Before he died in the Japanese prison camp, Bunker sent for Colonel Delbert Ausmus, cut the flag remnant into two pieces and gave one of the pieces to Ausmus. He told Colonel Ausmus he did not expect to survive the prison camp and that it was Ausmus' duty to take his piece of the flag to the Secretary of War. Ausmus concealed the remnant in his shirt cuff, and shortly after the war ended, Ausmus delivered it to Secretary Patterson. In November 1945, Ausmus described the circumstances under which he received the remnant from Bunker:"He was taken to Billibid prison in Manila and came down with pneumonia.
