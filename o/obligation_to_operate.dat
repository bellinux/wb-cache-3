5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, {{the company had}} sold all its hotel operations. The merged company {{retained}} the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> dining services on the trains, which throughout the 1980s necessitated considerable subsidies from NSB. In 1988, NSB decided to organize {{the operation of the}} dining services through tendered contracts; the first contract (from 1990 through 1995) was won by TogService, a Narvesen subsidiary. The owners had an agreement that neither could sell without the approval of the other. In 1995 NSB sold its shares with Fritt Ord's approval, and the company was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.|$|E
5|$|Four {{companies}} bid for {{the initial}} public service <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> the line: Fjord1 Partner, Norges Statsbaner, Tide Bane and Veolia Transport Norge. On 3 April 2009, the public transport agency Skyss announced that Fjord1 Partner, {{a joint venture between}} Fjord1 AS and Keolis, had won the tender competition. Fjord1 Partner received 324 applications for their 26 jobs as drivers and 10 jobs as traffic controllers. In 2014 Fjord1 AS sold their shares in Fjord1 Partner to Keolis, and the company changed its name to Keolis Norge AS.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} made in September 2008, the Social Democrats, the Conservative People's Party, the Liberal Party and the Danish People's Party {{agreed to}} not fund {{an expansion of}} the metro northwest. Initially, the system operated trains from 01:00 to 05:00 only on Thursdays through Saturdays, but, starting on 19 March 2009, night service was extended {{to the rest of the}} week. This caused a logistical challenge, because Metro Service used the nights for maintenance. The routes were therefore set up in such a way that the system could be operated on only a single track, leaving the other free for work. In May 2009, six companies were pre-qualified to bid for the public service <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> the metro. These were Serco-NedRailways, Ansaldo STS, Arriva, S-Bahn Hamburg, Keolis and DSB Metro—a joint venture between DSB and RATP. The process was delayed because of a procedural error by Metroselskabet, who failed to pre-qualify DSB Metro.|$|E

50|$|The airline was {{established}} in March 2002 and started operations in October 2002. It was the launch customer for the Bombardier CRJ-900. The airline was started so that Mesa Air Group could fulfill its contractual <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> the CRJ-900 as America West Express for America West Airlines. Establishing Freedom was necessary as Mesa Airlines was also operating as US Airways Express under a code share agreement for US Airways. US Airways' collective bargaining agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association prohibited contract carrier code share arrangements with regional jet carriers, if that carrier operated aircraft with more than 70 seats. Mesa Airlines, therefore, could not operate as US Airways Express and operate the CRJ-900.|$|R
25|$|LaSalle Street Fund {{bought the}} mall in the early 1980s and oversaw {{continued}} expansion, including {{the addition of a}} fourth anchor store. September 1, 1985, marked the first legal Sunday shopping day in the State of Texas. It, like other area malls, celebrated the end of the state's 24-year-old blue law with entertainment and special promotions. Some smaller retailers objected to the new hours but mall officials informed them in writing of their contractual <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> while the mall is open. January 1, 1987, was the first New Year's Day that the anchor stores were open for business on the holiday. Many smaller stores in the mall followed their lead, although it would be a few years before every store would be obligated to be open {{on the first day of}} the new year.|$|R
5|$|No {{aircraft}} {{has ever}} taken off from Værøy Airport after the accident, except in June 1992, when a Cessna 172 brought 3 skydivers from Bodø Skydiving Club (Bodø Fallskjermklubb) to the island, {{accompanied by a}} Piper Cherokee 140 from Bodø Flyklubb and an experimental plane. The Cessna made 2 landings and take-offs, and dropped the skydivers over the runway at approx. 8000 feet. The Piper and experimental craft made at least one landing and take-off each, during a public show held close to the airport. In 1992, the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications decided to permanently close the airport, after it had been temporarily closed since the accident. In 1995, Værøy Heliport was opened further south on the island, and Helikopter Service was awarded the public service <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> the route. The helicopter service sometimes uses the closed airport as a reserve airport during bad weather.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1907, there were {{calls from the}} valley {{population}} and Zermatt hoteliers for the Visp-Zermatt-Bahn to operate also im Winter. The SBB and the VZ refused to conduct such operations, however, due to the high costs that would result, and the consequent lack of profitability. Also, the danger of accidents due to avalanches and flooding was regarded as an incalculable risk. In addition, {{for a long time}} there was, {{on the part of the}} VZ, a stance that in any event Zermatt was not suited to being a winter resort. The Valais Council of State, which viewed the prospect of winter traffic positively, therefore considered the possibility of extending the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> the VZ to the winter months, at least for the section from Visp to St. Niklaus. As the concession text was limited to stipulating running times, and as, in the absence of any precedent, an amendment to the concession against the wishes of the concession holder would not be feasible, further efforts were abandoned until 1914. With the outbreak of World War I, the demand for continuous operations became obsolete for the time being.|$|E

A new base was established at Belfast City with additional frequency to the Isle of Man and Cork. The Leeds Bradford route also operated daily. The Gloucestershire route operated every weekday morning In August 2009 a new route was started to Newcastle upon Tyne, and in May 2010 the company tendered for a seven-month Public Service <b>Obligation</b> contract <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> the Cardiff-Isle of Anglesey route for the Welsh Assembly Government.

5000|$|Many interments, {{where the}} present {{cemetery}} is located, had already occurred before the official {{establishment of the}} cemetery. This fact prompted a group of citizens to form a group called, [...] "Tempe Cemetery Association". The Tempe Cemetery Company, officially established the cemetery on September 13, 1887. The property was donated by Niels Peterson in 1888. Peterson himself was buried there until 1923, when he was exhumed and re-interned in the property where his historic house is located. The location was chosen {{not only because of}} its seclusion, since it is situated several miles from the town (Tempe was not considered a [...] "city" [...] at the time) limits, but because the buttes served as a prominent geographical marker. The officers of the Tempe Cemetery Company formed the first corporate entity to administer the cemetery. The first section to be professionally developed by the Tempe Cemetery Company, was the “Pioneer Section” located adjacent to earlier, pre-1897 burials. [...] For the next decade, Double Butte grew to become Tempe’s primary burial place. The economic situation in the 1920s and 30's also had its effects on the cemetery. The Tempe Cemetery Company was in dire financial straits, and the cemetery itself suffered immensely as a result. Many of the graves were sunken and the area around them, such as the trees and grass, began to die because of lack of water and care. [...] In 1958, the City of Tempe assumed the <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> the cemetery. After sixty years of private, volunteer-organization management, the Tempe Double Butte Cemetery fell under the administration by the City of Tempe. It remains under city ownership and administration to this day.|$|R

40|$|Total {{investment}} {{costs for the}} wineries in this study ranged from $ 560, 894 for the 2, 000 case winery to $ 2, 339, 108 for the 20, 000 case winery. Building and land costs account for {{the largest percentage of}} total {{investment costs}} for all wineries. Cooperage accounts for the second largest percentage of total investment cost. The highest percent of variable costs for each winery are packaging costs. Full time labor, cooperage, and purchasing of grapes are the next highest operating costs by percentage. Depreciation of capital assets makes up the highest percentage of fixed costs. Economies of size exist at a decreasing rate among all of the wineries. That is, as the output of the winery increases, the per unit costs of production decline. Average total costs per case decrease from $ 154. 41 for the 2, 000 case winery to $ 124. 93 for the 20, 000 case winery. The wineries in this study all have the ability to produce positive cash flows by year three, showing that all operating costs and debt obligations can be met.

40|$|To foster competition, {{governments can}} {{intervene}} by auctioning licenses <b>to</b> <b>operate,</b> or by imposing divestitures. The Dutch government has done exactly that, organizing auctions to redistribute tenancy rights for highway gasoline stations and imposing divestitures of such stations {{on the four}} major companies. We evaluate this policy experiment and find that the auctioning of licenses without an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> divest has no discernible effect on prices. An <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> divest lowers prices by 1. 3 - 2. 3 % at divested sites. Moreover, prices decrease by 0. 9 - 1. 2 % at sites nearby. This suggests that the observed price decreases are at least partly due to competitive spillovers...|$|R
