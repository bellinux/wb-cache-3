Ferrihydrite-organic matter associations with different <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> loadings were reduced either by Geobacter bremensis or abiotically by Na-dithionite. Both types of experiments showed decreasing initial Fe-reduction rates and decreasing degrees of reduction with increasing amounts of mineral-bound <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> At similar <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> loadings, coprecipitated ferrihydrites were more reactive than ferrihydrites with adsorbed <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> The difference {{can be explained by}} the smaller crystal size and poor crystallinity of such coprecipitates.

Carbon {{in the form of}} THAA, most likely from mineral-precipitating proteins, contributed 30 - 45 % of the TOC in both corals.

Chlorophyll-a and b were present in annual bands where endolithic algae were present, but these compounds were minor contributors to TOC. The distribution of specific organic compounds showed that <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> was well preserved throughout the time period sampled in both the total and intracrystalline pools.

40|$|The {{decomposition}} and {{accumulation of}} organic materials in submerged (anaerobic) soils and sediments differ considerably {{from those in}} their aerobic counterparts. This {{is caused by the}} lack of oxygen or anaerobiosis. Compared to aerobic soils, there is preferential accumulation of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in submerged rice soils. This paper reviews the current literature to establish basis or bases for <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> accumulation in wetland soils and sediments. The decomposition or destruction of organic materials is lessened and incomplete, and the humification of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> is decreased under flooded conditions. Consequently, the overall <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> decomposition rates are slower in submerged soils than those in aerobic soils and this results in net accumulation of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in soils or sites that remain flooded for several years. Also, high <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> soils or Histosols are developed in permanently waterlogged sites or soils because the rate of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> destruction is slower than its accumulation. The balance between <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> inputs and decomposition is the primary determinant of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> accumulation or depletion. Several hypotheses have been postulated to explain the accumulation of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in submerged soils. They include the deleterious effects on microbial activity of reduction products produced such as hydrogen sulfide or volatile fatty acids and toxic concentrations of ammonia, aluminium, iron, and other cations in soil solution. The absence of electron acceptors such as iron oxides and hydroxides in submerged soils and sediments slows down <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> oxidation and mineralization. Formation of recalcitrant complex organic molecules with <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> fractions, e. g., through enrichment of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> with phenolics in intensified irrigated rice production system, may render them less available for microbial attack and utilization.

The change of soil climate and the incorporation of aboveground C inputs within the soil lead to no unique effect on biodegradation rates, because of their strong interaction with the regional climate and the soil physical properties. The periodical perturbation of soil structure by tools and the subsequent drying–rewetting cycles may be the major factor increasing <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> decomposition rates by exposing the <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> that is physically protected in microaggregates to biodegradation.

Soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> is a substantial global reservoir of carbon and disturbance of equilibrated soils often leads to efflux of significant quantities of CO 2. Anthropogenic influences shift the inputs, disturb the structure and alter the biochemistry of soil, profoundly disrupting soil-forming processes. Urbanization leads to soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> equilibria that {{are different from those}} in naturally forming soils. Measurement of soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in diverse cities suggests that they differ in their capacity to accumulate soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> Here I quantify soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> and examine the limitations of its accumulation within cities by comparing differences in soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> and natural and anthropogenic characteristics at the neighborhood, city and regional scales in Portland, Oregon to that in the Pacific Northwest. I found that each Portland neighborhood has distinct urban characteristics and tree and shrub community composition, but soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> content is indistinguishable among them. Across Portland, neither vegetation structure nor urban factors appear to directly influence soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> content. Rather, microbial biomass, bulk density and total nitrogen appear to be important factors controlling soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> content in Portland. The amount of soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> stored in Portland 2 ̆ 7 s soils is statistically indistinguishable from Pacific Northwest soils, in contrast to other temperate cities...|$|R
