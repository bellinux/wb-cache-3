40|$|Objectives. The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to test the application of the Transtheoretical Model <b>of</b> <b>Change</b> (TTM) in relation to exercise behaviour of 298 Hong Kong Chinese undergraduates. Design and methods. A cross-sectional design was used. Respondents completed measures <b>of</b> stages <b>of</b> <b>change,</b> self-efficacy, processes <b>of</b> <b>change,</b> decisional balance, exercise and demographic data. Results. Significant effects for stage <b>of</b> <b>change</b> were found for self-efficacy, pros, exercise and nine of the 10 processes <b>of</b> <b>change.</b> In general, scores on these variables were found to increase across the stages although post hoc tests revealed slightly different patterns of significant differences. Cons were not found to differ significantly across stages <b>of</b> <b>change.</b> The relationship between self-efficacy and processes <b>of</b> <b>change</b> was dependent on stage <b>of</b> <b>change.</b> Conclusions. The results support some of the assumptions of the TTM but raise questions about the predicted relationships between stages <b>of</b> <b>change</b> and processes <b>of</b> <b>change</b> and between self-efficacy and processes <b>of</b> <b>change</b> at each stage <b>of</b> <b>change.</b> The practical implications of the findings for the development of interventions to improve young people's exercise levels are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The Transtheoretical Model <b>of</b> <b>Change</b> is {{intended}} to be a general model <b>of</b> <b>change</b> that can be applied to many populations and domains <b>of</b> <b>change.</b> However, most <b>of</b> the studies that have investigated this model have focused on addiction-related topics or on individual psychotherapy. The current study explored whether this model's predictions applied to couples and their readiness to change their relationship. Data from two samples were collected. The first sample consisted of 65 volunteer couples recruited from the community. The second sample consisted of 55 couples that participated in a 9 -week relationship enhancement seminar. Factor analyses of questionnaires designed to measure the stages <b>of</b> <b>change</b> and processes <b>of</b> <b>change</b> predicted by the Transtheoretical Model <b>of</b> <b>Change</b> did not produce the hypothesized factors. In general, use <b>of</b> <b>change</b> processes did not predict change in relationship satisfaction. However, there was some evidence that wives' use <b>of</b> <b>change</b> processes had more impact on relationship satisfaction than did husbands' use <b>of</b> <b>change</b> processes. Couples at higher stages <b>of</b> <b>change</b> tended to experience greater improvements in marital satisfaction than did couples at lower stages <b>of</b> <b>change.</b> Couples with partners at similar levels <b>of</b> readiness to <b>change</b> did not experience greater improvements in marital satisfaction than did couples at dissimilar levels <b>of</b> readiness to <b>change.</b> In general, couples using the processes <b>of</b> <b>change</b> that matched their stage <b>of</b> <b>change</b> did not experience greater changes in marital satisfaction. However, as predicted by the Transtheoretical Model <b>of</b> <b>Change,</b> use <b>of</b> consciousness raising processes was less helpful for couples at higher stages <b>of</b> <b>change</b> than for couples at lower stages <b>of</b> <b>change.</b> Reasons for the failure to support many of the claims of the Transtheoretical Model <b>of</b> <b>Change</b> are explored and suggestions for future research are provided...|$|R

40|$|Research {{into the}} {{phenomenon}} <b>of</b> <b>change</b> has attracted interest {{from a range}} of management disciplines; organizational, management, behavioural and operations. Each discipline brings with it a perspective which informs the theoretical debates and empirical research, resulting in different ideas, meaning and approaches taken in studying the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>change.</b> Ideas about the meaning of the content <b>of</b> <b>change,</b> why contextual factors might influence the process <b>of</b> <b>change</b> and, how does the process <b>of</b> <b>change</b> unfold over time, are three important aspects to understanding the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>change.</b> This literature review draws on the three concepts of the content, context and process <b>of</b> <b>change</b> to explore the extant change literature. Evidence based literature reviews have a strong tradition within the medical field and {{have been shown to be}} a rigorous method for determining efficacy of clinical trials. This review applies the principles of this method but within a management research context and reviews 52 papers. Variations in the aspects of organizational context and process <b>of</b> <b>change</b> empirically studied confirm that context plays a significant and influential role in processes <b>of</b> <b>change</b> and change outcomes. There is little evidence to support the idea that the content <b>of</b> <b>change</b> influences the process <b>of</b> <b>change</b> activities and this is an area that needs further research. Further research is also needed to develop the idea of the importance <b>of</b> emergent <b>change</b> activities within planned change frameworks...|$|R
