5|$|In 1835, Smith {{encouraged}} some Latter Day Saints in Kirtland {{to purchase}} rolls of ancient Egyptian papyri from a traveling exhibitor. Over {{the next several}} years, Smith worked to produce what he reported was a translation {{of one of these}} rolls, which was published in 1842 as the Book <b>of</b> <b>Abraham.</b> The Book <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> speaks of the founding of the Abrahamic nation, astronomy, cosmology, lineage and priesthood, and gives another account of the creation story. The papyri from which Smith dictated the Book <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> were thought to have been lost in the Great Chicago Fire. However, several fragments were rediscovered in the 1960s, were translated by Egyptologists, and were determined {{to be part of the}} Book of the Dead with no connection to Abraham.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln's mother, Nancy, {{is widely}} {{assumed to have}} been the {{daughter}} of Lucy Hanks, although no record of Nancy Hanks' birth has ever been found. According to William Ensign Lincoln's book The Ancestry <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> Lincoln, Nancy was the daughter of Joseph Hanks; however, the debate continues over whether she was born out of wedlock. Still another researcher, Adin Baber, claims that Nancy Hanks was the daughter <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> Hanks and Sarah Harper of Virginia.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{supporters}} of infant baptism argue that circumcision is {{the sign of}} the covenant God made with Abraham and should be received by all the members of his covenant. The children <b>of</b> members <b>of</b> <b>Abraham's</b> covenant are themselves members <b>of</b> <b>Abraham's</b> covenant. Christians are members <b>of</b> <b>Abraham's</b> covenant [...] Therefore, the children of Christians are members <b>of</b> <b>Abraham's</b> covenant. Since baptism is the New Testament form of circumcision, the children of Christians should receive {{the sign of the}} covenant by being baptised.|$|R

5|$|A unique {{collection}} of maps {{assembled in the}} early 1570s, {{many of which are}} assembled from portions of Mercator's earlier maps: 9 constructed from Europe (1554), 6 from British Isles (1564) and 2 from the world map (1569). The map of Europe on pages 1 and 2 is taken from the 1569 world map. There are also 2 manuscript maps of Mercator and 13 maps are from the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> Ortelius.) Note that Mercator did not term this {{collection of}} maps an atlas.|$|E

5|$|Although {{he owned}} a number of slaves, and his {{marriage}} to Virginia Shelby had {{left him with a}} good many more, Breckinridge had been a supporter of gradual emancipation and colonization of blacks since his early political career. As the sectional crisis worsened, this led him into several high-profile debates, notably with fellow Kentuckian Robert Wickliffe, the uncle of Robert C. Wickliffe. His support <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> Lincoln for president in the election of 1860 pitted him against his own nephew, Vice President John C. Breckinridge.|$|E
5|$|Another {{commemorative}} {{event was}} {{proposed for the}} anniversary, the Moulin à paroles. Thousands gathered on the Plains <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> to listen to recitations of 140 significant texts from Quebec history, including the 1970 FLQ Manifesto. The inclusion of that document in the event led to condemnations and a boycott from federalist politicians and the withdrawal of some government funding for the event. The Moulin à paroles took place without incident.|$|E
5|$|Around {{this time}} the marshall of Jülich {{approached}} Mercator {{and asked him to}} prepare a set of European regional maps which would serve for a grand tour by his patron's son, the crown prince Johannes. This remarkable collection has been preserved and is now held in the British Library under the title Atlas of Europe (although Mercator never used such a title). Many of the pages were assembled from dissected Mercator maps and in addition there are thirty maps from the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum <b>of</b> <b>Abraham</b> Ortelius.|$|E

The complete work was first published serially in Times and Seasons in 1842, and was later canonized in 1880 by the LDS Church as part of its Pearl of Great Price.|$|E
