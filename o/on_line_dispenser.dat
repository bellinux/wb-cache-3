30|$|The above {{criteria}} {{were employed in}} some tunnel close crossing construction projects (Liu et al. 2005) in Shanghai {{as well as some}} projects in Shenzhen, including a double deck tunnel and two running tunnels <b>on</b> <b>Line</b> 1 under crossed by tunnels <b>on</b> <b>Line</b> 2, tunnels <b>on</b> <b>Line</b> 1 under crossed by tunnels <b>on</b> <b>Line</b> 3, and tunnels <b>on</b> <b>Line</b> 2 under crossed by tunnels <b>on</b> <b>Line</b> 4. The Shanghai soft ground is composed of littoral deposits featuring with saturated, flow to soft plastic clay with high compressibility and sensitivity and low strength, long stabilizing time and big settlement after being disturbed. The existing subway tunnels often have already produced some even large settlements on account of the long-term consolidation settlements of underlying soil (Wang and Liu 2001; Ye et al. 2007). In some later projects, more strict {{criteria were}} adopted. The allowed settlement and uplift were both reduced to 5  mm and the demand for tunnel convergence was < 20  mm in projects of Shanghai, embracing tunnels <b>on</b> <b>Line</b> 2 under-crossed by tunnels <b>on</b> <b>Line</b> 4 (Wang et al. 2004; Hu and Huang 2006), tunnels <b>on</b> <b>Line</b> 2 above-crossed by tunnels <b>on</b> <b>Line</b> 8 (Wang and Yu 2006), and others presented by Chen et al.
