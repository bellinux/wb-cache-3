5|$|In 1891, German {{botanist}} Otto Kuntze {{challenged the}} generic name Banksia L.f., <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name Banksia {{had previously been}} published in 1775 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, republishing B.aemula as Sirmuellera serratifolia. The challenge failed, and Banksia L.f. was formally conserved.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Olivier Bancoult, {{a native}} Chagossian {{and leader of}} the Chagos Refugees Group, brought a {{judicial}} review claim against the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs for the initial ordinance which led to the Chagossian removal. Bancoult sought a writ of certiorari <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ordinance was ultra vires and failed the Wednesbury test of reasonableness, as it was irrational.|$|E

5|$|The {{founder of}} khất sĩ {{had been a}} {{supporter}} of freeing birds {{as an act of}} compassion, and this has been continued by some monks and lay people as it is believed to be meritorious, but others have spoken out against <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> demand for birds used for such ceremonies merely prompt more people to capture them in the first place.|$|E
5|$|When Slayton {{submitted}} the proposed crew assignments to NASA headquarters, George Mueller turned them down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> crew was too inexperienced. So Slayton asked Jim Lovell, {{who had been}} the backup commander for Apollo 11, and was slated to command Apollo 14, if his crew would be willing to fly Apollo 13 instead.

50|$|CEQA plaintiffs such as {{community}} {{and environmental groups}} often challenge projects with negative declarations, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> EIRs should have been carried out.

5000|$|The {{judge in}} Thomas' trial then, sua sponte (of his own accord), issued an order {{indicating}} a possible [...] "manifest error of law" [...] {{in connection with}} his [...] "making available" [...] jury instruction, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> it may have contravened binding 8th Circuit precedent, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> a case upon which the RIAA and the Court had relied had been vacated by the Court which had issued it, without Judge Davis's knowledge.

5|$|An {{investigation}} {{conducted by}} the office of the Prosecutors General of the Soviet Union (1990–1991) and the Russian Federation (1991–2004) confirmed Soviet responsibility for the massacres but refused to classify this action as a war crime or an act of genocide. The investigation was closed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> perpetrators of the atrocity were already dead, and since the Russian government would not classify the dead as victims of the Great Purge, formal posthumous rehabilitation was deemed inapplicable.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the most}} {{circulated}} coins in the United States {{at the time}} were Spanish currency, Hamilton proposed that minting a United States dollar weighing almost as much as the Spanish peso would be the simplest way to introduce a national currency. Hamilton differed from European monetary policymakers in his desire to overprice gold relative to silver, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States would always receive an influx of silver from the West Indies. Despite his own preference for a monometallic gold standard, he ultimately issued a bimetallic currency at a fixed 15:1 ratio of silver to gold.|$|E
5|$|Before 1923, Coghlan {{had opposed}} the {{amalgamation}} of Northern and Southern Rhodesia, concerned {{that it would}} make responsible government harder to attain. One outcome of the Jameson Raid in 1895–96 had been to prevent the concentration of the BSAC into one administration. Instead, the High Commission in Bechuanaland was maintained, Northern Rhodesia kept its own administration, and Britain oversaw BSAC affairs more closely. One year into his premiership, Coghlan began to consider territorial expansion and staked a claim to northwestern Bechuanaland. The Dominions Office rejected the claim <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Union of South Africa would respond with its own claim for the southern half of the territory.|$|E
50|$|National church-state {{separation}} {{groups have}} spoken out {{in opposition to}} Question 790 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> allowing religious groups to access state grants could tempt them away from their main mission.

50|$|As psychoanalysts {{continued}} {{to explore the}} glossed of unconscious motives, Otto Fenichel distinguished different sorts of rationalization—both the justifying of irrational instinctive actions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> they were reasonable or normatively validated, and the rationalizing of defensive structures, whose purpose is unknown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> they have some quite different but somehow logical meaning.|$|R
50|$|This {{conviction}} was quashed in July 2004 by the Court of Criminal Appeal <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> had {{new evidence}} of bank accounts {{been available to}} the trial jury they might have had raised doubts therefore rendering the conviction unsafe. A retrial was not ordered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> Redmond had served virtually all his sentence.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{being more}} popular than some men's {{football}} events (one match saw a 53,000 strong crowd), women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on Association members' pitches, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game (as played by women) was distasteful. Some speculated that this may have also been due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted. This {{led to the formation}} of the English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds.|$|E
5|$|Field's {{failure to}} secure {{independence}} concurrently {{with the end}} of the Federation caused his Cabinet's support for him to waver during late 1963 and early 1964. The RF caucus in January 1964 revealed widespread dissatisfaction with him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British seemed to be outwitting him. The Prime Minister was put under immense pressure to win the colony's independence. Field travelled to England later that month to press Douglas-Home and Sandys for independence, and raised the possibility of UDI on a few occasions, but returned empty-handed on 2 February.|$|E

A report by the London Borough of Hillingdon's planning department rejected the proposal in December that year <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> site was already overdeveloped. Local residents had raised this concern in November that year, which {{the leader of the}} council explained was out of the council's control due to planning laws.|$|E

5|$|Gottesman did his {{graduate}} {{work at the}} University of Minnesota, which then patterned its clinical psychology program on the Boulder model, which emphasized research theory and clinical practice. He joined the graduate program in 1956 after three years with the Navy, supported by the Korean War G.I. Bill. He began investigating personality traits in identical and fraternal twins who had filled out the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). His Ph.D. thesis, submitted to Psychological Monographs, was rejected before a review <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> nature–nurture issue it addressed had already been settled in favor of nurture. On appeal, the thesis was reviewed and accepted for publication.|$|E

English botanist James Britten proposed the genus name Isostylis in 1905, and hence called it Isostylis serrata, {{for the same reasons}} as Kuntze. The challenges failed, and Banksia L.f. was formally conserved in 1940.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Rockefeller {{unveiled}} {{plans for}} the Potantico Expressway, a connector from the to-be-constructed Hudson River Expressway (NY9A) to the Taconic State Parkway. Some opposition to the idea arose <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new highway would only benefit the Rockefeller estate and not the residents. Nonetheless, construction began on the Potantico Expressway (now known as Phelps Way) in 1969. When the highway was completed in November1970, it became part of a rerouted NY117. NY117's former alignment along Bedford Road became NY448. The Hudson River Expressway project was cancelled in 1971, and the western stub of the expressway now serves Phelps Hospital.|$|E

His application was rejected, a decision upheld by the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Federal Court of Australia. In June 2002, Al-Kateb stated that he wished to voluntarily leave Australia and be sent to Kuwait or to Gaza. However attempts by the Government of Australia to remove Al-Kateb to Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Syria, and the Palestinian territories (which would have required the approval of Israel) failed.|$|E
5|$|In June 1915, Sir George Makgill, Secretary of the Anti-German Union, {{applied for}} {{permission}} from the High Court to issue quo warranto writs against Speyer and Sir Ernest Cassel, a German-born Privy Counsellor, requiring them to prove their right to hold that position. Makgill's claim was that the Act of Settlement 1701 prevented a person born outside Britain or its dominions from being a Privy Counsellor. In December 1915, Lord Chief Justice Lord Reading rejected the application <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> relevant sections of the Act of Settlement had been repealed by later legislation.|$|E
