5|$|Modern Macedonian language, a south Slavic language, is {{unrelated}} to the Ancient Macedonian language. It is currently the subject of two major disputes. The first is over the name (alternative ways <b>of</b> <b>referring</b> to this language {{can be found in}} the terminology by group section and in the article Macedonian language naming dispute). The second dispute is over the existence of a Macedonian language distinct from Bulgarian, the denial of which is a position supported by nationalist groups, Bulgarian and other linguists and also by many ordinary Bulgarians.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{religious}} {{language has}} been explained as via negativa, analogy, symbolism, or myth, {{each of which}} describes a way of talking about God in human terms. The via negativa is a way <b>of</b> <b>referring</b> to God according to what God is not; analogy uses human qualities as standards against which to compare divine qualities; symbolism is used non-literally to describe otherwise ineffable experiences; and a mythological interpretation of religion attempts to reveal fundamental truths behind religious stories. Alternative explanations of religious language cast it as having political, performative, or imperative functions.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Bede wrote the Historia Ecclesiastica, {{there were two}} common ways <b>of</b> <b>referring</b> to dates. One was to use indictions, which were 15-year cycles, {{counting}} from 312 AD. There were three different varieties of indiction, each starting on a different day of the year. The other approach was to use regnal years—the reigning Roman emperor, for example, or the ruler of whichever kingdom was under discussion. This meant that in discussing conflicts between kingdoms, the date {{would have to be}} given in the regnal years of all the kings involved. Bede used both these approaches on occasion, but adopted a third method as his main approach to dating: the Anno Domini method invented by Dionysius Exiguus. Although Bede did not invent this method, his adoption of it, and his promulgation of it in De Temporum Ratione, his work on chronology, is the main reason why it is now so widely used. Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle, contained in De Temporum Ratione, was developed from Dionysius Exiguus’ famous Easter table.|$|E

5|$|Sherman's {{financial}} expertise and {{his friendship with}} Hayes made him a natural choice for Treasury Secretary in 1877. Like Grant before him, Hayes had not consulted party leaders about his cabinet appointments, and the Senate took the then-unusual step <b>of</b> <b>referring</b> {{all of them to}} committee. Two days later, senators approved Sherman's nomination after an hour of debate, and he began lobbying his former colleagues to approve the other nominations, which they eventually did. Hayes and Sherman became close friends in the next four years, taking regular carriage rides together to discuss matters of state in private. In the Treasury, as in the Senate, Sherman was confronted with two tasks: first, to prepare for specie resumption when it took effect in 1879; second, to deal with the backlash against the diminution of silver coinage.|$|E
5|$|Wagner's role at Ludwig's court became controversial; in particular, Ludwig's habit <b>of</b> <b>referring</b> Wagner's policy {{ideas to}} his ministers alarmed the court. When Wagner demanded the sacking both of Ludwig's cabinet {{secretary}} {{and of his}} prime minister, there was a public outcry, and in December 1865 Ludwig reluctantly told Wagner to leave Bavaria. The king did not, however, withdraw his patronage or financial support. After a few months' wandering, in March 1866 Wagner arrived in Geneva, where Cosima joined him. They travelled together to Lucerne where they found a large lakeside house, the Villa Tribschen. Wagner made immediate arrangements to rent the house, at the king's expense, and by 15 April was installed in his new home.|$|E

2500|$|Referred itch is {{the class}} <b>of</b> <b>referred</b> {{sensation}} {{that focuses on}} the situation in which an itch in one place on the body simultaneously triggers an itch in a different location. [...] Other examples <b>of</b> <b>referred</b> sensation include sensations of temperature, pain, and pressure. Referred itch is commonly observed in completely healthy individuals and can often go unnoticed depending upon the particular person’s self-awareness of their itches and the causes of those itches. The ephemeral nature <b>of</b> <b>referred</b> itch and its restriction to a very small area on one’s body (the itch is precisely located, it does not induce widespread itching) make it difficult to document or even notice.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The groin pain {{experienced}} by patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA) is {{often accompanied by}} areas <b>of</b> <b>referred</b> pain and changes in skin sensitivity. We aimed to identify the supraspinal influences that underlie these clinical manifestations that we consider indicative of possible central sensitization. METHODS: Twenty patients with hip OA awaiting joint replacement and displaying signs <b>of</b> <b>referred</b> pain were recruited into the study, together with age-matched controls. All subjects completed pain psychology questionnaires and underwent quantitative sensory testing (QST) in their area <b>of</b> <b>referred</b> pain. Twelve <b>of</b> 20 patients and their age- and sex-matched controls underwent {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) while the areas <b>of</b> <b>referred</b> pain were stimulated using cold stimuli (12 degrees C) and punctate stimuli (256 mN). The remaining 8 of 20 patients underwent punctate stimulation only. RESULTS: Patients were found to have significantly lower threshold perception to punctate stimuli and were hyperalgesic to the noxious punctate stimulus in their areas <b>of</b> <b>referred</b> pain. Functional brain imaging illustrated significantly greater activation in the brainstem of OA patients in response to punctate stimulation <b>of</b> their <b>referred</b> pain areas compared with healthy controls, and the magnitude of this activation positively correlated with the extent of neuropathic-like elements to the patient's pain, as indicated by the PainDETECT score. DISCUSSION: Using psychophysical (QST) and brain imaging methods (functional MRI), we have identified increased activity with the periaqueductal grey matter associated with stimulation of the skin in <b>referred</b> pain areas <b>of</b> patients with hip OA. This offers a central target for analgesia aimed at improving the treatment of this largely peripheral disease...|$|R

25|$|There is an {{untested}} {{hypothesis that}} claims that referred itch uses the spinocervical tract pathway. The cells in this tract {{lie in the}} dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and its axons run in the ipsilateral and dorsolateral quadrant, {{which is consistent with}} observations that stimuli in the trigger points are ipsilateral to the sites <b>of</b> <b>referred</b> sensations. These axons project to the thalamus and midbrain, suggesting that the thalamus is involved in the phenomenon. The cells in this tract are also excited by mechanical stimuli, lending support that this pathway can explain the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>referred</b> itch. Central neuronal damage to this area – either direct or secondary to peripheral nerve damage – makes it an area of focal hyperexcitability or reduced inhibition. This hypothesis {{has been found to be}} unlikely because there would be an expected progression of itches (i.e., from legs to trunk, and from trunk to neck). However, there is no symmetrical distribution found between trigger zones and sites <b>of</b> <b>referred</b> sensation.|$|R

25|$|When first discovered, Iapetus {{was among}} four Saturnian moons {{labelled}} the Sidera Lodoicea by their discoverer Giovanni Cassini after King Louis XIV (the other three were Tethys, Dione and Rhea). However, astronomers {{fell into the}} habit <b>of</b> <b>referring</b> to them using Roman numerals, with Iapetus being Saturn V. Once Mimas and Enceladus were discovered in 1789, the numbering scheme was extended and Iapetus became SaturnVII. And {{with the discovery of}} Hyperion in 1848, Iapetus became Saturn VIII, which it is still known by today (see naming of natural satellites).|$|E
25|$|Cassini {{named the}} four new moons as Sidera Lodoicea ("the stars of Louis") to honour king Louis XIV of France. By {{the end of}} the seventeenth century, astronomers fell into the habit <b>of</b> <b>referring</b> to them and Titan as SaturnI through SaturnV (Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, Iapetus). Once Mimas and Enceladus were {{discovered}} in 1789, the numbering scheme was extended to SaturnVII by bumping the older five moons up two slots. The discovery of Hyperion in 1848 changed the numbers one last time, bumping Iapetus up to SaturnVIII. Henceforth, the numbering scheme would remain fixed.|$|E

25|$|Multimodality in {{classrooms}} {{has brought about}} the need for a new definition of literacy. According to Gunther Kress, a popular theorist of multimodality, literacy, when defined, usually refers to the combination of letters and words to make messages and meaning and can often be attached to other words in order to express knowledge of the separate fields, such as visual- or computer-literacy. However, as multimodality becomes more common, not only {{in classrooms}}, but in work and social environments, the definition of literacy extends. Instead <b>of</b> <b>referring</b> only to reading and alphabetic writing, or being extended to other fields, literacy and its definition now encompass multiple modes. It has become more than just reading and writing, and now includes visual, technological, and social uses among others.|$|E

25|$|Several {{characteristics}} {{are in line}} with this mechanism <b>of</b> <b>referred</b> pain, such as dependency on stimulus and the time delay in the appearance <b>of</b> <b>referred</b> pain as compared to local pain.

Furthermore, referred pain generally appears within seconds in humans as opposed to minutes in animal models. Some scientists attribute this to a mechanism or influence downstream in the supraspinal pathways. Neuroimaging techniques such as PET scans or fMRI may visualize the underlying neural processing pathways responsible in future testing.|$|R
