5|$|Adler's memoirs were {{published}} in the New York socialist Yiddish-language newspaper Die Varheit in 1916–1919, and briefly resumed in 1925 in an unsuccessful revival of that paper; his granddaughter Lulla Rosenfeld's English translation was published only in 1999. The 1916–1919 portion of the memoir gives a detailed picture of his Russian years. The 1925 portion gives a comparably detailed picture of his time in London, although with some evasions around the relative timing of his relationships with his wife Sonya and with Jennya Kaiser and Dinah Shtettin. It contains only a relatively fragmentary description <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>New</b> York career. In the English-language book of these memoirs, Rosenfeld attempts to fill the gaps with her own commentary.|$|E
5|$|After his release, Friday {{returned}} to Acton, {{where he had}} a girlfriend called Maxine Doughan and a baby daughter called Nicola. Maxine was of mixed race. The local controversy surrounding the interracial relationship caused the couple and their circle of friends to be socially isolated, {{and led to a}} physical attack on the group one night in an Acton public house. Despite this, and the opposition by both sets of parents—Alf refused to even attend the wedding—they married, both aged 17. Friday did not take his marital commitments seriously and continued to womanise, drink heavily and take narcotics. A friend who played for Walthamstow Avenue, a semi-professional Isthmian League club from north-east London, took Friday along to training one day in early 1971. Friday played well enough for Walthamstow to sign him the same day on wages of £10 per week. Many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>new</b> teammates were asphalters from east London, and Friday soon joined them in that trade.|$|E

His former colonial command was allocated to midshipman Charles Robbins, who was promoted Acting Lieutenant by virtue <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>new</b> role. The remaining vessels in the flotilla, Lady Nelson and Francis, arrived in Port Dalrymple on 21 November.
