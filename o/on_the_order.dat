Luftflotte 2 had 1,311 machines including; 533 Bf 109s, 107 Bf 110s, 51 reconnaissance and 484 medium bomber aircraft.

5|$|Capacitive discharge: {{this is a}} nonthermal plasma {{generated}} by the application of RF power (e.g., 13.56MHz) to one powered electrode, with a grounded electrode held at a small separation distance <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> of 1cm. Such discharges are commonly stabilized using a noble gas such as helium or argon.|$|E
5|$|Comparing {{the driver}} energy input to the fusion energy output {{produces}} a number known as fusion energy gain factor, labelled Q. A Q value {{of at least}} 1 {{is required for the}} system to produce net energy. Since some energy is needed to run the reactor, in order for there to be net electrical output, Q has to be at least 3. For commercial operation, Q values much higher than this are needed. For ICF, Qs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> of 25 to 50 are needed to recoup both the electrical generation losses and the large amount of power used to power the driver. In the fall of 1960, theoretical work carried out at LLNL suggested that gains of the required order would be possible with drivers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> of 1MJ.|$|E

5|$|A {{neutron star}} {{is a highly}} dense remnant of a star that is {{primarily}} composed of neutrons—a particle that is found in most atomic nuclei and has no net electrical charge. The mass of a neutron star is {{in the range of}} 1.2 to 2.1 times the mass of the Sun. As a result of the collapse, a newly formed neutron star can have a very rapid rate of rotation; <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> of a hundred rotations per second.|$|E
5|$|After {{they are}} formed, {{the stars in}} the {{globular}} cluster begin to interact gravitationally with each other. As a result, the velocity vectors of the stars are steadily modified, and the stars lose any history of their original velocity. The characteristic interval for this to occur is the relaxation time. This is related to the characteristic length of time a star needs to cross the cluster as well as the number of stellar masses in the system. The value of the relaxation time varies by cluster, but the mean value is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> of 109 years.|$|E

5|$|All the bound {{protons and}} {{neutrons}} in an atom {{make up a}} tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07fm, where A is {{the total number of}} nucleons. This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> of 105fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{patients}} present without any known risk factors evident, {{a number of}} risk factors {{for the development of}} cholangiocarcinoma have been described. In the Western world, the most common of these is primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts which is closely associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). Epidemiologic studies have suggested that the lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma for a person with PSC is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> of 10%–15%, although autopsy series have found rates as high as 30% in this population. The mechanism by which PSC increases the risk of cholangiocarcinoma is not well understood.|$|E
5|$|Another {{attempt to}} revive the RDF 1.5 concept, today known more {{generally}} as bistatic radar, was made in March 1940 when a modified set was mounted in Bristol Blenheim L6622. This set was tuned to the transmissions of the new Chain Home Low transmitters, dozens of which were being set up along the UK coastline. These experiments did not prove successful, with a detection range <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> of , and the concept was abandoned for good.|$|E

5|$|Another {{problem with}} the NIF lasers is that the flashtubes create a {{significant}} amount of heat, which warms the laser glass enough to cause it to deform. This requires a lengthy cooling-off period between shots, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> of 12 hours. In practice, NIF manages a shot rate of less than one shot per day. To be useful as a power plant, about a dozen shots would have to take place every second, well beyond the capabilities of the NIF lasers.|$|E
5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E
5|$|Attempts to {{synthesize}} elements 119 and 120 push {{the limits of}} current technology, due to the decreasing cross sections of the production reactions and their probably short half-lives, expected to be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> of microseconds. Heavier elements, beginning with element 121, would likely be too short-lived to be detected with current technology, decaying within a microsecond before reaching the detectors. Where this one-microsecond border of half-lives lies is not known, and this may allow the synthesis of elements 121 through 124, with the exact limit depending on the model chosen for predicting nuclide masses. The nuclides 296Uue, 296,299Ubn, 300Ubu, 300,303Ubb, 304Ubt, and 304Ubq, continuing up a possible narrow one-microsecond alpha-decaying corridor, could conceivably be produced in the reactions of projectiles of 50Ti, 54Cr, and 58Fe with targets of 248Cm, 249Bk, and 249Cf.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{collisions}} between {{electrons and}} atoms, the drift velocity of electrons in a conductor is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> of millimeters per second. However, {{the speed at}} which a change of current {{at one point in the}} material causes changes in currents in other parts of the material, the velocity of propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed. This occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave, with the velocity dependent on the dielectric constant of the material.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{is used to}} make {{free-machining}} steels and free-machining {{aluminium alloys}} for precision machining properties. It has similar effect to lead and improves the chip breaking during machining. The shrinking on solidification in lead {{and the expansion of}} bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities. Similarly, alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and lead exhibit a very small change (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> 0.01%) upon melting, solidification or aging. Such alloys are used in high-precision casting, e.g. in dentistry, to create models and molds. Bismuth is also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons and as a thermocouple material.|$|E
5|$|Bodies {{recovered}} were {{preserved and}} taken to Halifax, Nova Scotia, the closest city to the sinking with direct rail and steamship connections. A large temporary morgue {{was set up in}} a curling rink and undertakers were called in from all across Eastern Canada to assist. Relatives from across North America came to identify and claim the bodies of their relatives. Some bodies were shipped to be buried in their home towns across North America and Europe. About two-thirds of the bodies were identified. Of the remaining 150 unclaimed bodies, 121 were taken to the non-denominational Fairview Lawn Cemetery; 19 were buried in the Roman Catholic Mount Olivet Cemetery, and 10 were taken to the Jewish Baron de Hirsch Cemetery. Unidentified victims were buried with simple numbers based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> in which their bodies were discovered.|$|E
