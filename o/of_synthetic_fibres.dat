5|$|During the Second World War, silk {{supplies}} from Japan were cut off, so western countries {{were forced to}} find substitutes. Synthetic fibres such as nylon were used in products such as parachutes and stockings, replacing silk. Even after the war, silk {{was not able to}} regain many of the markets lost, though it remained an expensive luxury product. Postwar Japan, through improvements in technology and a protectionist market policy, became the world's foremost exporter of raw silk, a position it held until the 1970s. The continued rise in importance <b>of</b> <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> and loosening of the protectionist economy contributed to the decline of Japan's silk industry, and by 1975 it was no longer a net exporter of silk.|$|E

The appeal of [...] "new" [...] technologies wore off, and nylon fabric “was going out of style in the 1970s”. [...] Also, consumers became concerned about environmental costs throughout the production cycle: obtaining the raw materials (oil), energy use during production, waste produced during creation of the fibre, and eventual waste disposal of materials that were not biodegradable.

50|$|Texturising is {{the process}} by which {{synthetic}} fibres are modified to change their texture - the physical appearance of the fibre. Texturising techniques can include bulking (where thermoplastic fibres are twisted, heat set and untwisted), crimping and coiling, amongst others. Texturising takes advantage of the thermoplastic nature <b>of</b> <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres,</b> and uses it to set texturised features in place.|$|E

40|$|During {{a routine}} flock visit, a farmer {{observed}} {{that one of}} the eight tooth Bapedi rams had been losing body condition despite being separated from the flock and fed supplementary feed. The ram’s body condition score was assessed as 2 out of 5 (one point less than the average {{of the rest of the}} rams) and the teeth appeared normal with no excessive wear. The rumen was assessed by auscultation, palpation and ballottement where a foreign body (approximately 20 cm × 5 cm – 10 cm) was clearly palpated and ballotted. A rumenotomy was performed and a large mass of tightly compacted foreign matter and plant material was removed. The mass consisted <b>of</b> <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre,</b> plant material and calcium phosphate (50. 5 %). It appeared to have formed as the result of the ingestion <b>of</b> a <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> which formed the nidus of a concretion.

The addition <b>of</b> the <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> had a slight effect on the strength properties of concrete but, at the same time, it had a significant influence on the fracture mechanics parameters by the modification of pre-cracking and particularly post-cracking behaviour of the concrete.

The safari suit continued to be the de facto business attire, particularly in government/public sectors and the SMB arena in India, through the late-1990s. With India's growth over the 1990s, liberalization and with the middle class suddenly having more disposable income, the younger generations began to gravitate towards more modern western fashions such as suits and other business attire. Although it is still visible in some parts of India, the Safari suit is now indelibly associated with the so-called License Raj - the slow, inefficient Indian bureaucracy of the 1970s and the 1980s.|$|R

40|$|Purpose This {{research}} {{examines the}} effects of Type 1 and Type 2 <b>synthetic</b> polypropylene <b>fibres</b> in concrete, with and without silica fume, regarding porosity.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents an}} exploratory study into the mechanical biodeterioration <b>of</b> <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> rein- forced marine concrete. Light and inverted microscopy, {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray analyser (EDX) of site specimens were used to observe colonisation at the fibre cement interface, enabling the further understanding of this interaction. Algal fronds have been observed grow- ing between fibre and cement. Colonisation has been observed, entangled with, and adhered to fibres. This new mechanism occurs when the material bond is weakened {{as a direct result}} of the physical activ- ity of an organism, such as its growth. Loss of surface material, either through biodeterioration or through other mechanical means, such as power washing, is not the primary cause of degradation, but may exac- erbate the condition.
