5|$|According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Penda became king in 626, ruled for 30 years, and was 50 years <b>old</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{time of his}} accession. That {{he ruled}} for 30 years {{should not be taken}} as an exact figure, since the same source says he died in 655, which would not {{correspond}} to the year given for the beginning of his reign unless he died in the thirtieth year of his reign. Furthermore, that Penda was truly 50 years <b>old</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of his reign is generally doubted by historians, mainly because of the ages of his children. The idea that Penda, at about 80 years of age, would have left behind children who were still young (his son Wulfhere was still just a youth three years after Penda's death, according to Bede) has been widely considered implausible. The possibility has been suggested that the Chronicle actually meant to say that Penda was 50 years <b>old</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of his death, and therefore about 20 in 626.|$|E
