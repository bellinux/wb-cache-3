5|$|Bohemond made an {{alliance}} with Az-Zahir Ghazi, the Ayyubid emir of Aleppo, and Kaykaus I, the Seljuq sultan <b>of</b> <b>Rum,</b> who often invaded Cilicia during the following years, to prevent Leo I from attacking Antioch. Conflicts between Bohemond and the Latin Patriarchs of Antioch enabled Raymond-Roupen to seize Antioch in 1216, but Bohemond regained the principality in 1219. After Leo I's death, Bohemond tried to secure Cilicia to his younger son, Philip, but Constantine of Baberon, who had administered Cilicia during the previous years, imprisoned Philip in 1224. Bohemond allied with Kayqubad I, sultan <b>of</b> <b>Rum,</b> {{but he could not}} prevent Philip's murder in 1225.|$|E
5|$|In 1825 the {{inhabitants}} <b>of</b> <b>Rùm</b> (then numbering some 450 people) {{were given a}} year's notice to quit. The inhabitants <b>of</b> <b>Rùm</b> had simply been tenant farmers, paying rent to the laird; they owned neither the land they worked, nor the houses in which they lived. On 11 July 1826, about 300 of {{the inhabitants}} boarded two overcrowded ships bound for Cape Breton in Nova Scotia. The laird, and Dr Lachlan, paid for their journey. The remaining population followed in 1827. Similar evictions happened all over the gaelic-speaking parts of Scotland, and collectively {{became known as the}} Highland Clearances.|$|E
5|$|In 1204 the Byzantine {{capital of}} Constantinople was sacked and {{occupied}} by the Fourth Crusaders, an important moment of the Christian East–West Schism. The Byzantine Empire, already weakened by misrule, was left divided and in chaos. Taking advantage of the situation, the Seljuk Sultanate <b>of</b> <b>Rum</b> began seizing territory in Western Asia Minor, until the Nicaean Empire was able to repulse the Seljuk Turks from the remaining territories still under Roman rule. Eventually Constantinople was re-taken from the Latin Empire in 1261 by the Nicaean Empire. However {{the position of the}} Byzantine Empire in the European continent remained uncertain due to the presence of the rival kingdoms of the Despotate of Epirus, Serbia and the Second Bulgarian Empire. This, combined with the reduced power of the Sultanate <b>of</b> <b>Rum</b> (Byzantium's chief rival in Asia) led to the removal of troops from Asia Minor to maintain Byzantium's grip on Thrace. However the weakening of the Sultanate <b>of</b> <b>Rum</b> was by no means a blessing to the Empire as nobles known as ghazis began setting up their fiefdoms, {{at the expense of the}} Byzantine Empire. While many Turkish beys participated in the conquest of Byzantine and Seljuk territory, the territories under the control of one such Bey named Osman I posed the greatest threat to Nicaea and to Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|In the 13th century {{there may}} be {{references}} to the island as Raun-eyja and Raun-eyjum and Dean Munro writing in 1549 calls it Ronin. Seafaring Hebrideans had numerous taboos concerning spoken references to islands. In the case <b>of</b> <b>Rùm,</b> use of the usual name was forbidden, the island being referred to as Rìoghachd na Forraiste Fiadhaich—"the kingdom of the wild forest".|$|E
5|$|Malik-Shah was {{succeeded in}} the Anatolian Sultanate <b>of</b> <b>Rum</b> by Kilij Arslan I, and in Syria {{by his brother}} Tutush I, who died in 1095.

40|$|The 'rigid unit mode' (RUM) model {{requires}} unit blocks, in {{our case}} tetrahedra of SiO_ 4 groups, to be rigid within first order of the displacements of the O-ions. The wave-vectors of the lattice vibrations, which obey this rigidity, are determined analytically. Lattices with inversion symmetry yield generically surfaces <b>of</b> <b>RUMs</b> in reciprocal space, whereas lattices without this symmetry yield generically lines <b>of</b> <b>RUMs.</b> Only in exceptional cases as in beta-quartz a surface <b>of</b> <b>RUMs</b> appears, if inversion symmetry is lacking. The occurence of planes and bending surfaces, straight and bent lines is discussed. Explicit calculations are performed for five modifications of SiO_ 2 crystals.

5|$|Alarmed by the Georgian successes, Süleymanshah II, the resurgent Seljuqid sultan <b>of</b> <b>Rûm,</b> rallied his vassal emirs {{and marched}} against Georgia, but his camp was {{attacked}} and destroyed by David Soslan at the Battle of Basian in 1203 or 1204. The chronicler of Tamar {{describes how the}} army was assembled at the rock-hewn town of Vardzia before marching on to Basian and how the queen addressed the troops from the balcony of the church.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its natural}} {{strategic}} {{position on a}} small peninsula into the Mediterranean Sea below the Taurus Mountains, Alanya has been a local stronghold for many Mediterranean-based empires, including the Ptolemaic, Seleucid, Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman Empires. Alanya's greatest political importance came in the Middle Ages, with the Seljuk Sultanate <b>of</b> <b>Rûm</b> {{under the rule of}} Alaeddin Kayqubad I, from whom the city derives its name. His building campaign resulted in many of the city's landmarks, such as the Kızıl Kule (Red Tower), Tersane (Shipyard), and Alanya Castle.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond {{hurried to}} Antioch {{when his father}} died in April 1201. The commune {{confirmed}} his right to rule. The military orders also supported him, but the noblemen who remained loyal to Raymond-Roupen fled to Cilicia. Leo of Cilicia besieged Antioch to assert Raymond-Roupen's claim. Bohemond made an alliance with Az-Zahir Ghazi, the Ayyubid emir of Aleppo, and Kaykaus I, the Seljuq sultan <b>of</b> <b>Rum,</b> who forced the Armenian troops to return to Cilicia.|$|E

5|$|Cornelius had no {{luck with}} the MacLean leadership, who {{remained}} Episcopalian, but the (small) population <b>of</b> <b>Rùm</b> does appear to have become Roman Catholic again. In {{the rest of the}} nation, Covenanters gradually gained political control. Coll (along with the lands of the MacLeans of Duart) was under the shrieval authority of the sheriff of Argyll; under pressure from the Earl of Argyll, {{one of the most powerful}} Covenanter leaders, shrieval authority over Rùm was transferred from Inverness to the Argyll sheriff, which was under the control of the Earl's family.|$|E
5|$|Following the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantines {{were left}} in an {{unstable}} position. The capture of Constantinople in 1261 and subsequent campaigning did not come at a good time — the weakening of the Sultanate <b>of</b> <b>Rum</b> resulted in many beyliks breaking away as autonomous states, such as the Emirate founded by Osman I. Although this weakening of power gave the Empire of Nicaea a temporary free hand, it {{was nothing more than}} a small respite not capitalized as much as it could have been.|$|E
5|$|Following the forfeiture, most of Garmoran {{remained}} with the Scottish crown until 1469, when James III granted Lairdship {{of it to}} John of Ross, the new MacDonald leader, who passed it to his own half-brother, Hugh of Sleat. Clan Ranald objected to the transfer to Hugh, and appear to have retained some level of physical posession, {{regardless of whether they}} any legal authority to do so. The status <b>of</b> <b>Rùm</b> during this period is unclear, as surviving records do not mention it as part of Hugh's possessions.|$|E

5|$|In 1944 the Seagram Company started {{manufacturing}} the Captain Morgan brand <b>of</b> <b>rum,</b> {{named after}} the privateer. In 2001 the Captain Morgan brand was sold to Diageo, the multinational drinks company based in London. The name of Morgan has been attached to local sites in the Caribbean, such as Morgan's Bridge, Morgan's Pass and Morgan's Valley in Clarendon, Morgan's Harbour Hotel and Beach Club in Kingston, the Hotel Henry Morgan, located in Roatán, Honduras, the Port Morgan resort located in Haiti and Captain Morgan's Retreat and Vacation Club on Ambergris Caye, Belize.|$|E
5|$|John was succeeded as owner <b>of</b> <b>Rùm</b> by his son, George (later Sir George). George built Kinloch Castle in 1900 using {{sandstone}} quarried at Annan. The interior boasted an orchestrion {{that could}} simulate {{the sounds of}} brass, drum and woodwind, an air-conditioned billiards room, and a jacuzzi. A dam was built on Coire Dubh burn for hydroelectric purposes; the house was the first private home in Scotland, outside of Glasgow, to have an electricity supply.|$|E
5|$|The Ayyubid sultan, Al-Adil I, stormed {{into the}} County of Tripoli, {{creating}} {{an opportunity for}} Leo to plunder the land around Antioch in 1208. Bohemond persuaded Kaykaus I, Sultan <b>of</b> <b>Rum,</b> to invade Cilicia, forcing Leo to withdraw from Antioch. Pope Innocent tasked Albert Avogadro, Patriarch of Jerusalem, to mediate a peace. Avogadro, who was an ally of the Knights Templar, urged Leo to return Bagras to them. In an attempt to renew the truce, Leo obeyed the legate's demand, promising to withdraw from Bagras.|$|E

5000|$|Botran Solera 1893: An {{elegant and}} complex {{combination}} <b>of</b> <b>rums</b> between 5 and 18 years old. These rums {{have been through}} a process of selection, they have been selected because of their balance and shape. The maturing <b>of</b> these <b>rums</b> has intensified its smell, resulting in burly and elegant rum.|$|R
50|$|El Dorado rums are blended {{selections}} of different ‘vintages’ or batches <b>of</b> <b>rums</b> from different stills, aged in oak barrels. The age statement specifically indicates the youngest rum in the blend. This rule {{is the same}} as the one for Scotch Whisky and is used for rums produced in English-speaking countries. In contrast, the age statement on the label <b>of</b> <b>rums</b> produced by the Solera system indicates the oldest rum contained in the blend. This is a traditional method of ageing used in sherry production and is usually associated with rums from Spanish-speaking countries.|$|R
5|$|Alexander, the {{previous}} MacDonald leader, had made land grants to the eldest and youngest sons of Lachlan MacLean, grandson of Alexander's aunt. John Garbh (the youngest son) now obtained Rùm (possibly, Alexander had quitclaimed it to him); like Hugh's gains, Clan Ranald objected to this transfer. Traditional accounts claim that John Garbh purchased a quitclaim of Clan Ranald rights from their leader, Allan, {{by giving them}} a galley; though the galley looked in good quality, the interior (so the legend says) was rotten, hence explaining Clan Ranald's refusal to accept John Garbh's ownership <b>of</b> <b>Rùm.</b> John Garbh subsequently seized Allan, and held him prisoner on Coll for 9 months; presumably Allan was only released once he had agreed to acknowledge the exchange.|$|E
5|$|Before the Revolution, New Englanders {{consumed}} {{large quantities}} <b>of</b> <b>rum</b> and beer as maritime trade provided relatively {{easy access to}} the goods needed to produce these items. Rum was the distilled spirit of choice as molasses, the main ingredient, was readily available from trade with the West Indies. In the continent's interior, colonists drank whiskey, as they had ready access to corn and rye but did not have good access to sugar cane. However, up until the Revolution, many colonists considered whiskey to be a coarse beverage unfit for human consumption, believing that it caused the poor to become raucous and disorderly.|$|E
5|$|On 14 May {{the broken}} {{remains of the}} two bower anchors, which were {{threatening}} to capsize the ship, were hauled in. During the following days the pack ice thickened, and in increasingly turbulent weather the boilers were closed down, since attempting to manoeuvre under power in these conditions would merely waste coal. Replenishing the ship's supply of fresh water was a further difficulty. A large iceberg was in view, but too far away in the prevailing weather conditions to be accessible, so to obtain drinking water the crew had to gather snow. Food was less of a problem; {{they were able to}} augment Aurora's food supplies from the penguins and seals that gathered around the ship. To boost morale the crew were given a ration <b>of</b> <b>rum</b> to celebrate Empire Day on 24 May.|$|E
