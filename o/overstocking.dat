5|$|From {{the late}} 1840s into the 1870s, Texas stockmen drove their beef cattle through {{southern}} Arizona on the Texas–California trail. Texans {{were impressed with}} the grazing possibilities offered by the Gadsden Purchase country of Arizona. In {{the last third of}} the century, they moved their herds into Arizona and established the range cattle industry there. The Texans contributed their proven range methods to the new grass country of Arizona, but also brought their problems as well. Texas rustlers brought lawlessness, poor management resulted in <b>overstocking,</b> and carelessness introduced destructive diseases. But these difficulties did force laws and associations in Arizona to curb and resolve them. The Anglo-American cattleman frontier in Arizona was an extension of the Texas experience.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, {{more than}} 40 {{people were killed}} in a fire {{accident}} in a firecracker unit. The police traced out unregistered units and irregularities that led to the accident. In a fire accident in August 2011, seven people were killed and five were seriously injured. A similar fire accident and blast in a private unit in September 2012 killed 40 people and injured 38 others. The common reasons cited for the accidents are inadequate training of workers and supervisors involved in different stages of production and marketing of firecracker items. Other reasons are found to be <b>overstocking</b> of explosives, raw material and finished goods, and employment of workers in excess of the permitted strength.|$|E
5|$|The iPhone 5S was {{the best}} selling phone on AT, Sprint, Verizon, and T-Mobile in September 2013 in the United States, outselling the iPhone 5C and Samsung Galaxy S4. According to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, the iPhone 5S outsold the 5C by a two-to-one margin during its September release, {{confirming}} Apple CEO Tim Cook's view that the high-end smartphone market was not reaching a point of market saturation. While commentators viewed the 5C as a flop because of supply chain cuts signifying a decline in demand, the 5S {{was viewed as a}} massive success. Apple admitted that it had failed to anticipate the sales ratio, leading to an <b>overstocking</b> of the 5C and shortages of the 5S.|$|E

In a letter to his shareholders, Patrick Byrne said, [...] "The good guys won". Copper River {{said in a statement that}} it continued to deny <b>Overstock's</b> allegations. Copper River managing general partner Marc Cohodes said [...] "Although settlement deprives us of the ability to disprove <b>Overstock's</b> case and prosecute our counterclaims, we decided that the litigation costs did not justify passing up a practical way to end four-and-half years of meritless litigation by Overstock." ...|$|R
25|$|Many foreign investors, {{especially}} British, {{financed the}} great ranches of the era. <b>Overstocking</b> {{of the range}} and the terrible winter of 1886 resulted in a disaster, with many cattle starved and frozen to death. Theodore Roosevelt, a rancher in the Dakotas, lost his entire investment; he returned east to reenter politics. From then on, ranchers generally raised feed to ensure they could keep their cattle alive over winter.|$|E
25|$|In early 1899, {{after the}} end of the Spanish–American War, the US Navy {{canceled}} its contracts because of <b>overstocking.</b> With no other business opportunities pending, the company struggled for several years. The court appointed Robert E. Jennings, a marketing expert and former vice-president of another steel company, as receiver in 1903, and he turned the company around. He was elected company president in 1904 and led the company through several years of innovation. Carpenter special steel was used in the early airplanes of the Wright brothers and in Glenn Curtiss aircraft and continues to be used in many types of high-performance craft.|$|E
25|$|Introduced grazing {{animals can}} also affect soil {{condition}} through physical compaction and break-up {{of the soil}} caused by the hooves of animals and through the erosion effects caused by the removal of protective plant cover. Such effects {{are most likely to}} occur on land subjected to repeated and heavy grazing. The effects of <b>overstocking</b> are often worst on soils of low fertility and in low rainfall areas below 500mm, as most soil nutrients in these areas tend to be concentrated in the surface so any movement of soils can lead to severe degradation. Alteration in soil structure and nutrient levels affects the establishment, growth and survival of plant species and in turn can lead to a change in woodland structure and composition.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, {{revenues}} dropped 5 {{percent over}} a two-month penalty period imposed by Google. According to the Associated Press, <b>Overstock</b> set up fake websites linking {{back to its}} own site. <b>Overstock</b> said it was penalized in part for a practice of encouraging college and university websites to post links to <b>Overstock</b> pages so that students and faculty could receive discounts. As {{a result of the}} Google penalty, search results for certain products dropped in Google rankings. During the same year, Overstock.com acquired naming rights to the former Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum, renaming it Overstock.com Coliseum. The Coliseum was later rebranded O.co Coliseum, in keeping with <b>Overstock's</b> then-rebranding as O.co (in April 2016, the name O.co Coliseum was dropped in favor of Oakland-Alameda Coliseum).|$|R

2500|$|Away {{from the}} river Hay is {{surrounded}} by flat, mostly-treeless plains, predominately of grey clay and red earth soils. [...] Saltbush shrublands (Atriplex sp.), with an understorey of grasses and forbs, was the dominant plant community {{at the time of}} European settlement. [...] However severe depletion of the saltbush has occurred after years of <b>overstocking,</b> damage by rabbits and the broad-scale agriculture of recent decades, particularly in areas along the river and proximate to irrigation canals. The plains surrounding Hay feature a complex system of shallow creek beds and dry lakes, interspersed by wind-created sand-ridges where Cypress-pine (Callitris sp.) is often found growing.|$|E
2500|$|Freegans {{are best}} known for {{recovering}} discarded food from commercial establishments, a practice known as [...] "dumpster diving" [...] or [...] "urban foraging" [...] in North America, [...] "skipping", [...] "bin raiding", or [...] "skipitarianism" [...] in the UK, [...] "skip dipping" [...] in Australia, [...] "containern" [...] in Germany, or [...] "doing the duck" [...] in New Zealand. Freegan diets are thus {{made possible by the}} range of practices that produce commercial food waste that is nonetheless still edible, such as conservative sell-by dates, the deliberate <b>overstocking</b> of certain perishable products (liked baked goods), or aesthetic criteria for fruits and vegetables. However, dumpster diving is not limited to rummaging for food; freegans report recovering clothing, books, appliances, bicycles, and furniture from commercial dumpsters as well.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effect of}} <b>overstocking</b> in cows {{can have a}} {{negative}} effect on milk production and reproduction rates which are two very important traits for dairy farmers. Overcrowding of cows in barns has been found to reduced feeding, resting and rumination. Although they consume the same amount of dry matter within the span of a day, they consume the food at a much more rapid rate, and this behaviour in cows can lead to further complications. The feeding behaviour of cows during their post-milking period is very important as it has been proven that the longer animals can eat after milking, the longer they will be standing up and therefore causing less contamination to the teat ends. This is necessary to reduce the risk of mastitis as infection has been shown to increase the chances of embryonic loss. Sufficient rest is important for dairy cows because it is during this period that their resting blood flow increases up to 50%, this is directly proportionate to milk production. Each additional hour of rest can be seen to translate to 2 to 3.5 more pounds of milk per cow daily. Stocking densities of anything over 120% have been shown to decrease the amount of time cows spend lying down.. Accessed 16 Nov 2016 ...|$|E

60|$|In {{countries}} like North America and the Australian colonies, where {{the knowledge and}} arts of civilized life and a high effective desire of accumulation coexist with a boundless extent of unoccupied land, the growth of capital easily keeps pace with the utmost possible increase of population, and is chiefly retarded by the impracticability of obtaining laborers enough. All, therefore, who can possibly be born can find employment without <b>overstocking</b> the market: every laboring family enjoys in abundance the necessaries, many of the comforts, {{and some of the}} luxuries of life; and, unless in case of individual misconduct, or actual inability to work, poverty does not, and dependence need not, exist. [In England] so gigantic has been the progress of the cotton manufacture since the inventions of Watt and Arkwright, that the capital engaged in it has probably quadrupled in the time which population requires for doubling. While, therefore, it has attracted from other employments nearly all the hands which geographical circumstances and the habits or inclinations of the people rendered available; and while the demand it created for infant labor has enlisted the immediate pecuniary interest of the operatives in favor of promoting, instead of restraining, the increase of population; nevertheless wages in the great seats of the manufacture are still so high that the collective earnings of a family amount, on an average of years, to a very satisfactory sum; and there is as yet no sign of decrease, while the effect has also been felt in raising the general standard of agricultural wages in the counties adjoining.|$|E
