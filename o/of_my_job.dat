However, Seaman failed {{to hold on to}} the ball and Jason McAteer scored from the rebound. Although many people believe that he deliberately took the penalty kick poorly for reasons of fair play, Fowler said at the time: [...] "As a goalscorer it's part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> to take it and I wanted to score it.

500|$|Ron Swanson {{was created}} by Parks and Recreation creators Greg Daniels and Michael Schur, {{although}} Nick Offerman himself had some input into the character's creation. Offerman said in July 2012 that [...] "NBC really resisted giving me this part. It took five months for me from the time Mike Schur and Greg Daniels said {{they wanted me to}} play this part. NBC insisted on auditioning every other guy in the country, and then they finally acquiesced." [...] The character's traits were partially inspired by a real-life Libertarian elected official that Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur encountered in Burbank while researching for the show, who favored as little government interference as possible and admitted, [...] "I don't really believe in the mission <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> [...] [...] [...] I'm aware of the irony." [...] Ron is also partially inspired by political appointees of President George W. Bush who were perceived to be opposed to the branch of government they were overseeing. Ron's signature mustache {{was one of the first}} ideas conceived for the character. Offerman said the deadpan style of humor he uses for Ron Swanson was cultivated during his youth, when he was an altar boy: [...] "I would read things with the utmost sincerity, and my cousin would be cracking up because he knew I was full of shit." ...|$|E

In a May 2013 interview with MTV, The Vagina Monologues writer and feminist Eve Ensler praised the singer, saying, [...] "I'm a huge Rihanna fan, I think she has a kind of agency over her sexuality and she's open about her sexuality, she has enormous grace and she's immensely talented." ...|$|E

He supported Barack Obama during the 2008 Democratic primary campaign and also for president. In January 2009 Forbes referred to Zakaria as one of the 25 most influential liberals in the American media. Zakaria has stated that he tries not to be devoted to any type of ideology, saying [...] "I feel that's part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>job...</b> which is not to pick sides but to explain what I think is happening on the ground.

Often I dreaded that some situation would catch me unaware and daub me with the yellow mud of a coward's reputation. I worried that I'd lose my temper, go haywire and end up before the grand jury twisting my uniform buttons nervously and begging for mercy. There was the wear and tear of wondering if the chiefs I served under would let me down when I needed to be backed up. And after I got to be chief, there was never a time when someone didn't hate my guts, and I had to be up on my toes to keep my enemies from feathering my back with knives.|$|E
2500|$|The {{challenge}} of designing Belle and the Beast's costumes paled {{in comparison to}} the difficulty of creating the enchanted objects, a combination of intricate wiring, prosthetics and pyrotechnics. Scale was the most prominent [...] "obstacle" [...] for Hould-Ward's to overcome: [...] "The problem was the presentation of an actor as a life-sized teapot when the characters in the film were so little in comparison". Because the castle's enchanted staff is slowly transforming into objects, shown at various stages of transformation without ever completely becoming the objects themselves, Hould-Ward was required to create several different costumes for each character in order to depict the transformation as the show progresses. Meanwhile, the costume of Lumiere alone was built by a team of forty people, including a creator of the prosthetic candle, hair and Vacuform specialist; the pyrotechnician, man responsible for equipping the costume's pyro unit with butane and man operating the butane tank were each separate people. While transforming animation into real life, Hould-Ward also worked on incorporating the human body each costume, explaining, [...] "I wanted the reality of the real person rather than the fantasy of the object... The essence <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> is to allow my real actors to take you to this fantastical place." [...] A system of wired frames was used to help the actors support their characters' heavy garments. Such elaborate costumes had never been designed for a Broadway production before. Cogsworth's costume features a fully functioning clock on his face. Meanwhile, Madame de la Grande Bouche was the production's most expensive costume.|$|E
