The Hebrew Ashuri script must be used and there are three main styles of lettering used: Beis Yosef – generally used by Ashkenazim; Arizal – generally used by Hasidim; Velish – used by Sefardim. The passages contain 3,188 letters, which take a sofer (scribe) between 10–15 hours to complete. The arm-tefillin has one large compartment, which contains all four biblical passages written upon a single strip <b>of</b> <b>parchment.</b> The head-tefillin has four separate compartments in each of which one scroll <b>of</b> <b>parchment</b> is placed.|$|E

5|$|The codex {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>parchment,</b> originally {{in double}} sheets, {{which may have}} measured about 40 by 70cm. The whole codex consists, with a few exceptions, of quires of eight leaves, a format popular throughout the Middle Ages. Each line of the text has some twelve to fourteen Greek uncial letters, arranged in four columns (48 lines per column) with carefully chosen line breaks and slightly ragged right edges. When opened, the eight columns thus presented to the reader have much the same appearance as the succession of columns in a papyrus roll. The poetical books of the Old Testament are written stichometrically, in only two columns per page. The codex has almost 4,000,000 uncial letters.|$|E

3000|$|Further studies {{analysing}} {{the effects}} <b>of</b> RH on <b>parchment</b> artefacts {{need to take}} account of the complexity of the interface between collagen and gelatine. Understanding how each structural phase <b>of</b> a <b>parchment</b> object is affected by changes in RH, and how they interact with one another is crucial for determining appropriate environmental conditions for parchment storage. It is also necessary to consider if there is a particular facet <b>of</b> the <b>parchment</b> that, in terms of preservation, is more important. For example, because ink is applied to the surfaces <b>of</b> <b>parchments,</b> and penetrates inwards; a majority of the ink will more likely be contained in the surface gelatine phase <b>of</b> the <b>parchment.</b> Since the collagen phase will be able to resist water changes at low temperatures [21, 41], should we consider the interface and gelatine phases to be structurally more important, and focus research to determine which RH conditions best preserve these structural phases?

5|$|Most of {{the bones}} in Turku were still in place in 1720 when they were catalogued for a {{transfer}} to Saint Petersburg during the Russian occupation of Finland in the Great Northern War.

What happened to the bones after that, remains unknown. According to some sources, the Russian vessel transporting the relics sank on the way. However, it is generally acknowledged that a piece of Henry's ulna had been placed in Bishop Hemming's reliquarium that was built in 1514 and treasured in the cathedral. Also enclosed was a piece <b>of</b> <b>parchment</b> stating the bone belonged to Henry. During the restoration work of the cathedral, the relic was relocated to the National Board of Antiquities.|$|E

25|$|Most {{illuminated}} manuscripts {{were created}} as codices, which had superseded scrolls; some isolated single sheets survive. A very few illuminated manuscript fragments survive on papyrus. Most medieval manuscripts, illuminated or not, were written on parchment (most commonly of calf, sheep, or goat skin), but most manuscripts {{important enough to}} illuminate were written on the best quality <b>of</b> <b>parchment,</b> called vellum, traditionally made of unsplit calfskin, though high quality parchment from other skins was also called parchment.|$|E
25|$|A fourth {{development}} was the early success of medieval papermakers at mechanizing paper manufacture. The introduction of water-powered paper mills, the first certain evidence of which dates to 1282, {{allowed for a}} massive expansion of production and replaced the laborious handcraft characteristic of both Chinese and Muslim papermaking. Papermaking centres began to multiply in the late 13th century in Italy, reducing the price of paper to one sixth <b>of</b> <b>parchment</b> and then falling further; papermaking centers reached Germany a century later.|$|E
25|$|Despite this {{it appears}} that the final {{breakthrough}} of paper depended just as much on the rapid spread of movable-type printing. It is notable that codices <b>of</b> <b>parchment,</b> which in terms of quality is superior to any other writing material, still had a substantial share in Gutenberg's edition of the 42-line Bible. After much experimentation, Gutenberg managed to overcome the difficulties which traditional water-based inks caused by soaking the paper, and found the formula for an oil-based ink suitable for high-quality printing with metal type.|$|E

25|$|Some {{contemporary}} artists prize the changeability <b>of</b> <b>parchment,</b> {{noting that the}} material seems alive and like {{an active participant in}} making artwork. To support the needs of the revival of use by artists, a revival in the art of preparing individual skins is also underway. Hand-prepared skins are usually preferred by artists because they are more uniform in surface and have fewer oily spots which can cause long-term cracking of paint than mass-produced parchment, which is usually made for lamp shades, furniture, or other interior design purposes.|$|E
25|$|The word {{parchment}} evolved (via the Latin pergamenum and the French parchemin) {{from the}} name of the city of Pergamon which was a thriving center <b>of</b> <b>parchment</b> production during the Hellenistic period. The city so dominated the trade that a legend later arose which said that parchment had been invented in Pergamon to replace the use of papyrus which had become monopolized by the rival city of Alexandria. This account, originated in the writings of Pliny the Elder (Natural History, Book XII, 69-70), is dubious because parchment had been in use in Anatolia and elsewhere long before the rise of Pergamon.|$|E
