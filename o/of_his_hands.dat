5|$|A cow, {{identified}} with Kamadhenu, is often depicted accompanying the god Dattatreya. In {{relation to the}} deity's iconography, she denotes the Brahminical aspect and Vaishnava connection of the deity contrasting with the accompanying dogs—symbolizing a non-Brahminical aspect. She also symbolizes the Panch Bhuta (the five classical elements) in the icon. Dattatreya is sometimes depicted holding the divine cow in one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
5|$|At a {{fast food}} {{restaurant}} in Arlington, Virginia, a man draws {{a gun and}} shoots three people before he is shot by police snipers outside. An older man revives the gunman and his victims by touching them with the palms <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jacobs {{began playing}} in para table tennis tournaments later that year, {{becoming}} {{a member of}} the National Paralympic Committee in 2010. He competes in Class 10, which is the highest level of functionality in the system. He usually trains with opponents who maintain full functionality. Jacobs himself has a problem with one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
50|$|Catmull used <b>his</b> left <b>hand</b> as {{the basis}} for the clip, first {{creating}} a model of it. He began making a plaster-of-paris mold <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> and accidentally pulled off the hair on the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> while removing the mold. He then made a plaster model from the mold and drew 350 small triangles and polygons on the model in ink. Digital counterparts of these polygons would represent the surface <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> in the computer.|$|R

5|$|Though {{the weapon}} may be {{depicted}} as an inanimate gada, Kaumodaki sometimes appears personified {{as a woman}} known as Gadadevi or Gadanari in sculptures of Vishnu. In depictions that use this version, Vishnu rests one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> on her head, while she herself holds the gada, is seen emerging from it or has the gada carved on her head/crown.|$|E
5|$|David Bell, the Home Office negotiator, kept contradicting himself, {{as if in}} a bid {{to prolong}} the negotiations. He would agree to our terms, then he would try and tell us it was out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> and go back on his word. If it was out of the Home Officer's hands—then whose hands was it in? I think the final stages were messed around by the Home Office so that our protest could help to divert the public's {{attention}} from the Poll Tax revolt that was going on throughout the country. As Alan Lord was snatched after being asked to negotiate on behalf of us all, this made us all more defiant about ending the protest.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} show {{a famous}} incident {{from the life}} of Saint Francis of Assisi, who is shown kneeling by a rock as he receives the stigmata of the crucified Christ on the palms <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and soles of his feet. Behind him are rock formations, shown in great detail, and a panoramic landscape that seems to relegate the figures to secondary importance. This treatment of Francis is the first such to appear in northern Renaissance art. The arguments attributing the works to van Eyck are circumstantial and based mainly on the style and quality of the panels. A later, third version is in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, but is weaker and strays significantly in tone and design.|$|E

5|$|A National Army relief column {{including}} the detachments under Husher, Fleetwood and Devine assembled at Lurkers' Ridge {{during the morning}} of 12 February. Under the command of Captain Tony Clark, it flanked through the townships south of the Alamo, engaging ZIPRA guerrillas along the way, then turned north to relieve Dyck. The Elands led the way, with Devine himself standing upright in the turret {{of one of them}} with a machine gun. At one point this was shot out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> prompting him to briefly stop the advance so he could jump down into the street to collect it. By the time the relief column reached the Alamo at 13:00, C Company had been pocketed for 16 hours. Four wounded 1RAR soldiers were evacuated, and Dyck left the building to point out targets for Devine's armoured cars. During the afternoon, A Company relieved D Company at Lurker's Ridge, and the ZANLA and ZIPRA guerrillas withdrew into the townships and the surrounding country, sporadically exchanging fire. Devine was sent to Essexvale to engage the rest of ZIPRA's armoured battle group, which surrendered when he arrived; the T-34 tanks were later found by the Zimbabwe National Army to be nonfunctional. By the evening of 12 February, the rebellion was over.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Birmingham, Doyle soon linked up with Championship club Nottingham Forest on a short-term loan deal in December 2004. The loan was then extended {{to keep him}} at the City Ground {{for the rest of}} the season. Doyle made his first-team debut for Forest in a fifth-round FA Cup tie against Tottenham Hotspur on 20 February 2005. As the match approached half-time, Doyle gifted Tottenham the lead as a Jermain Defoe free kick bounced out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and into the net, but Forest were able to equalise in the second half to take the tie to a replay. Even though Doyle only played in a further three league matches for Forest, he said he was glad to be able to play regular reserve-team football and the loan spell had exceeded his expectations. He was rumoured to be {{returning to}} Forest on loan for the following season, a move which did not occur.|$|E
5|$|Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is {{generally}} depicted standing. He wears rich clothes (generally in sculpture, only a dhoti) {{as well as}} various ornaments like a crown, armbands, necklaces etc., symbolic of royalty and the yagnopavita (sacred thread). In his eight arms, he is prescribed in the texts to carry gada (mace), sword, arrow and the Sudarshana Chakra in his left hands and shankha (conch), shield, bow and lotus in his right hands. However, in sculpture, he is often four-armed and in two <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> he holds a lotus and a conch, while his other hands rest on the heads of his personified weapons (ayudhapurusha) - Gadadevi or Gadanari (gada as a female) on his right and Chakrapurusha on his left, who stand as small figures besides his legs. They both look upwards towards him and hold fly whisks. A tiny figurine of the earth goddess Prithvi (who associated with Varaha and Vishnu as his consort) rises from the pedestal in between his feet, as though supporting the deity. A short dagger or sword may be tucked up in the waist belt of the god near the right hip, a peculiar feature of Kashmir icons. Attendants or devotees may be also shown besides or below Vishnu. Sometimes, Brahma and Shiva and the ten avatars of Vishnu may be depicted in the background.|$|E

5|$|The Bulls {{returned}} to the Delta Center for Game 6 on June 14, 1998, leading the series 3–2. Jordan executed a series of plays, considered {{to be one of}} the greatest clutch performances in NBA Finals history. With the Bulls trailing 86–83 with 41.9 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, Phil Jackson called a timeout. When play resumed, Jordan received the inbound pass, drove to the basket, and hit a shot over several Jazz defenders, cutting the Utah lead to 86–85. The Jazz brought the ball upcourt and passed the ball to forward Karl Malone, who was set up in the low post and was being guarded by Rodman. Malone jostled with Rodman and caught the pass, but Jordan cut behind him and took the ball out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> for a steal. Jordan then dribbled down the court and paused, eyeing his defender, Jazz guard Bryon Russell. With 10 seconds remaining, Jordan started to dribble right, then crossed over to his left, possibly pushing off Russell, although the officials did not call a foul. With 5.2 seconds left, Jordan gave Chicago an 87–86 lead with a game-winning jumper, the climactic shot of his Bulls career. Afterwards, John Stockton missed a game-winning three-pointer. Jordan and the Bulls won their sixth NBA championship and second three-peat. Once again, Jordan was voted the Finals MVP, having led all scorers averaging 33.5 points per game, including 45 in the deciding Game 6. Jordan's six Finals MVPs is a record; Shaquille O'Neal, Magic Johnson, LeBron James and Tim Duncan are tied for second place with three apiece. The 1998 Finals holds the highest television rating of any Finals series in history. Game 6 also holds the highest television rating of any game in NBA history.|$|E

25|$|In the Mechanics Magazine Robertson first {{proposed}} the London Mechanics' Institution. The idea was shortly taken out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> {{and those of}} Hodgskin, by a group around George Birkbeck. Robertson became a long term critic of the Institution.|$|E

25|$|The Titans {{took the}} ensuing kickoff {{and drove to}} the Patriots 33-yard line. But two penalties, a 10-yard {{intentional}} grounding call and a holding penalty, pushed them back 20 yards. McNair threw an 11-yard completion on the next play, but after that, Drew Bennett had the ball knocked out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> on fourth down and 12, and the Titans turned the ball over on downs with 1:38 left.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of the offside rule, the role of a {{sweeping}} defender or libero has become pretty much obsolete. However, in the last decades it has become popular for goalkeepers to take that role instead. A sweeping goalkeeper is good at reading the game, and prevents scoring opportunities by clearing passes and crosses outside of the goal area without the use <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> Manuel Neuer has often been described as a sweeper-keeper.|$|E
