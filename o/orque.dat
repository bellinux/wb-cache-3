A novel {{methodology}} {{based on}} short run control charts {{was developed to}} establish simultaneous intra and inter daily control of instrumental blank samples for trace elements analysis through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Eleven inorganic trace elements were analyzed, where chromium was selected to illustrate the methodology. The use of joint control charts, both based on the Quesenberry Q-statistics, revealed to be a suitable tool in detecting possible instrument contaminations as well as evaluating IPC-MS stability.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare peak torque values for {{isokinetic}} eccentric contractions of the right hamstrings and quadriceps of 15 young male adults (ages 20 - 30) and 13 older male adults (ages 50 and older). The eccentric flexion/extension ratios of the two populations were also compared. Eccentric testing at 120 degrees per second was performed on the KIN-COM isokinetic dynamometer. The results of the mean difference in peak torque for the hamstrings and quadriceps between the two groups of subjects indicated that the younger group had a significantly higher (p 3 ̆c. 0001) eccentric peak <b>orque</b> than the older group. The mean difference between flexion/extension ratios of the two groups indicated that the young group did not significantly differ (p 3 ̆c. 9917) from the older group. These findings illustrate the decline in isokinetic eccentric peak torque of the hamstrings and quadriceps with aging...|$|E

40|$|Chemical {{speciation}} in foodstuffs is of uttermost importance {{since it}} is nowadays recognized that both toxicity and bioavailability of an element depend on the chemical form in which the element is present. Regarding arsenic, inorganic species are classified as carcinogenic while organic arsenic, such as arsenobetaine (AsB) or arsenocholine (AsC), is considered less toxic or even non-toxic. Fish samples, from 3 different species (gilthead sea bream, meagre and salmon), were subjected to three different cooking methods: boiling, grilling and roasting. Arsenic content was determined on both raw and cooked samples by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Speciation {{studies were carried out}} by coupling a High Performance Liquid Chromatographer (HPLC) to an ICP-MS. To guaranty the quality of results samples were analyzed in duplicates and a reference material was used for total concentration determination and for speciation studies complying with metrological requirements. The obtained results for total arsenic were between 265 µg. kg- 1 and 7585 µg. kg- 1. The lowest value was observed in the samples from boiled meagre and the highest in grilled gilthead sea bream. The speciation studies revealed that, even though fish samples presented a high content of arsenic, more than 90 % of the arsenic present was in the form of arsenobetaine. Apparently, the culinary treatment does not enhance the interconversion of species. FCT PTDC/SAU-ESA/ 103825 / 2008 e <b>ORQUE</b> SUDOE Ref. SOE 3 /P 2 /F 59...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{assessed}} {{the impact of}} two cooking methods, steaming and boiling, through the true retention (%TR) of minerals in pseudocereals and rice (varieties Indica and Japonica). Mineral content was determined by ICP-OES. Cooking methods {{have an impact on}} mineral composition of pseudocereals with losses up to 20 %. Quinoa’s %TR varied from 100 % (manganese, phosphorus and iron) in steaming, to 83 % (copper) in boiled. In amaranth, it ranged from 98 % (copper) in boiling method, to 80 % (magnesium) in steaming. Buckwheat presents a %TR of 100 % in iron and 87 % in zinc. For boiled rice, the losses were higher in the variety Indica, with a decrease of 34 % for manganese. Steamed amaranth is a higher density food in particular for manganese, magnesium and phosphorus, which present a recommended nutrient intake (RNI) contribution of 70 %, 65 % and 44 %, respectively. Rice represents the lowest contribution to mineral RNI. This study demonstrates that estimation of mineral intake should be based on data obtained from cooked food.
