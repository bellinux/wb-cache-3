5|$|Immediately {{following}} the cyclone's onslaught, concerns arose amongst relief agencies and NGOs that {{the storm was}} either {{too early in the}} season or not damaging enough to dedicate a significant portion <b>of</b> <b>disaster</b> funds. Consequently, disagreements between prospective donors about the extent of emergency response resulted in delayed intervention. Post-storm assessments of the response to Bonita highlighted the need for increased coordination between agencies.|$|E

5|$|Although Xangsane had {{weakened}} considerably over land, {{residents of}} northern Thailand were advised {{of the threat}} of flooding from the remnant low of Xangsane as it approached. The Department <b>of</b> <b>Disaster</b> Prevention and Mitigation alerted its provincial offices throughout the country to be prepared for strong winds, flash flooding, and landslides. Residents in highland areas were also warned of possible mudslides, and the army was dispatched to aid in regional storm preparations.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the revolt}} was quickly suppressed, exaggerated reports <b>of</b> <b>disaster</b> {{prompted}} Mucianus to depart the capital with reinforcements of his own. Domitian eagerly sought {{the opportunity to}} attain military glory and joined the other officers {{with the intention of}} commanding a legion of his own. According to Tacitus, Mucianus was not keen on this prospect but since he considered Domitian a liability in any capacity that was entrusted to him, he preferred to keep him close at hand rather than in Rome.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Significant {{progress}} has been made in recent years for modeling spatial economic impacts <b>of</b> <b>disasters</b> in a regional context (for example, Okuyama and Chang eds. Modeling the Spatial Economic Impacts <b>of</b> <b>Disasters,</b> forthcoming). While these advancements are more toward modeling strategies based on conventional frameworks, little has been dealt with the theory on economics <b>of</b> <b>disasters,</b> since the pioneering work by Dacy and Kunreuther (The Economics <b>of</b> Natural <b>Disasters,</b> 1969). In this paper, “The Economics <b>of</b> Natural <b>Disasters</b> ” is reviewed and updated for providing a theoretical perspective toward disaster related research. The review is carried our through restructuring the framework of Dacy and Kunreuther with new findings from the recent studies and extending it to a regional context. In addition, the pape...|$|R

5|$|At 2100 UTC August 16, 2007 a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Puerto Rico. At 0300 UTC August 17 this advisory was upgraded to {{a tropical}} storm warning. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency, eager {{to make a good}} showing after its heavily criticized response to Hurricane Katrina, deployed a Federal Incident Response Support Team to the unincorporated territory of the United States ahead of Hurricane Dean. This five-member team <b>of</b> <b>disaster</b> management experts was equipped with satellite communication systems to provide video-teleconferencing and help make real-time assessments of any damage.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, Hanover, Saint Elizabeth, Saint James, and Westmoreland parishes were {{considered}} disaster areas. A task force {{was established by}} the Prime Minister Michael Manley for reconstruction efforts. About 7,758families, a total of 36,391people, required assistance with food supplies for over 13weeks. The Housing Task Force called {{for the construction of}} 582new houses, 300of which for those left homeless. The houses constructed for the people rendered homeless were prefabricated by the Ministry of Housing and then erected by the local authorities, under the guidance of the Ministry of Local Government.

5|$|In April 1878, L'Estrange reappeared on the Australian {{scene with}} a new {{performance}} – gas ballooning. The first balloon ascent in Australia {{had been made in}} Melbourne in 1853, with Sydney following five years later in December 1858. The idea that people could be lifted from the ground to fly and return safely fired the imagination of the public, and the novelty of balloon ascents continued to draw large crowds through the 1860s and 1870s. No doubt the very real chance <b>of</b> <b>disaster</b> and injury added to the crowd's keen interest, as mishaps were not uncommon.|$|E
5|$|On September3, Governor Jim Hunt {{declared}} a state <b>of</b> <b>disaster</b> for North Carolina, while President Bill Clinton declared Dare County a disaster area a week later. This allowed residents there to apply for federal assistance, {{as well as local}} governments to request aid to rebuild public buildings. Operating out of Avon, FEMA distributed about $1million in housing assistance to 444people and provided $400,000 in individual grants to 153applicants.

5|$|Research by Chandler, Griffin, and Sorensen into a {{link between}} letter names and {{donations}} has been widely accepted. They analyzed the records <b>of</b> <b>disaster</b> relief donations after seven hurricanes (among others, Katrina, Rita and Mitch).

They concluded that people want to overcome some of the negative feelings associated with the shared name and thus donate.Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices, but would to low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity.|$|E

5|$|The {{explosion}} {{was caused}} by a gas leak in a 30-year-old building. It severely damaged a nearby nine-story apartment building, causing it to collapse. Mónica Fein, mayor of Rosario, asked residents to avoid the area because of the risk that more buildings might collapse, and to ease the work <b>of</b> <b>disaster</b> management personnel. The streets were covered with broken glass from damaged buildings. Gas and electricity were immediately disconnected, and the national government sent an Argentine Federal Police task force to the scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Xangsane moved over Thailand on October 2 and combined with monsoonal moisture {{over the north}} {{central part of the}} country, causing torrential rains and severe flooding in over 35 provinces. Floodwaters broke through levees and barriers and flooded or damaged nearly 1.3million rai (2,100km², 520,000acres) of farmland and local infrastructure. Many municipalities reported flooding of up to three meters (10ft), and the municipality of Ang Thong reported flooding of 60cm (2ft). The Department <b>of</b> <b>Disaster</b> Prevention and Mitigation reported 47 deaths, and villages in several provinces reported significant levels of water pollution and waterborne illnesses from stagnant waters.|$|E
