5|$|The Electoral Commission {{decided to}} exclude the votes from one voting station in Tickeyline, near Tzaneen in Limpopo, because staff at the voting station were {{attacked}} {{at the close of}} voting and the security <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> could not be assured. The final results were announced on 10 May.|$|E
5|$|The electoral code {{of conduct}} was signed in Midrand, Gauteng on 19 March 2014. At the signing event, a draw was held in which the Freedom Front Plus {{won the right to}} appear at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> paper.|$|E
5|$|On the Sunday evening {{nine days}} before the {{scheduled}} All-Star game, the rosters are announced and the All-Star Final Vote nominees are announced on a nationally broadcast show. The voting commences after {{the announcement of the}} nominees {{toward the end of the}} show, and continues for a prescribed number of days. Generally, a single daily update <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> standings is released during the voting. After voting concludes, the top vote-getter for each league is announced. Over the course of the seven years of the voting, over 100 million votes have been cast.|$|E
25|$|The {{figures have}} also been {{reported}} as Karzai having 44.8% and Abdullah 35.1% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> based on 17% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country's polling stations (as opposed to 17% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballots).</b>|$|R

5|$|However, the {{aggressive}} tactics of Haywood and the IWW, {{along with their}} call for abolition of the wage system and the overthrow of capitalism created tension with moderate electorally-oriented leaders of the Socialist Party. Haywood and the IWW focused on direct action and strikes, which often led to violence, and were less concerned with political tactics. When Haywood was quoted speaking at public meetings in New York City {{to the effect that}} he had never advocated the use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> by the workers but had instead favored the tactics of direct action, an initiative recalling Haywood from the NEC was launched by the State Executive Committee of the Socialist Party of New York. In February 1913 the recall of Haywood was approved by a margin of more than 2-to-1. Following his defeat, Haywood left the ranks of the Socialist Party, joined by thousands of other IWW members and their sympathizers.|$|E
5|$|The {{total number}} of seats in the Parliament are {{allocated}} to parties proportionally {{to the number of}} votes received in the second vote <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> using the d'Hondt method. For example, to determine who is awarded the first list seat, the number of list votes cast for each party is divided by one plus the number of seats the party won in the region (at this point just constituency seats). The party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat, which is then added to its constituency seats in allocating the second seat. This is repeated iteratively until all available list seats are allocated.|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} tensions, however. Finn Thoresen left {{the party in}} November 1992, and later formed New Future Coalition Party. More importantly, because of {{disagreements}} in 1992 and 1993, pertaining to libertarianism in general and especially the European Union question, several libertarians that had entered the Progress Party in the 1980s ceased their activity in the party. MPs Tor Mikkel Wara and Petter Bjørheim announced their intentions to leave politics {{after the end of}} their terms, as did Pål Atle Skjervengen. Jan Erik Fåne tried to win renomination, but the nomination meeting in Akershus put traditionalist Fridtjof Frank Gundersen on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot.</b> Fåne was offered the second spot, but pulled out. Eight months later it turned out that holding the second spot on the ballot did indeed give a Parliament seat.|$|E
50|$|Also, parties {{representing}} regional linguistic minorities obtain seats if {{they receive}} at least 20% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> in their constituency.|$|R
25|$|A second {{release of}} partial results {{was made by}} the {{election}} authorities after 17%, or 940,000, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> were counted.|$|R
25|$|<b>Of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> {{that were}} returned, over 80 per cent of {{participating}} voters agreeing to all eight proposed principles. Treaty negotiations resumed.|$|R
5|$|The {{applicant}} for {{an election}} {{to be avoided}} may ask for a declaration that the election is void, that a particular candidate was wrongfully declared to have been elected, and/or that another candidate was duly elected. The applicant may also request for a scrutiny– that is, a re-examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> papers– {{if he or she}} alleges that an unsuccessful candidate had a majority of lawful votes. When a scrutiny is conducted, the election judge may order a vote to be struck off if the voter was not on the register of electors assigned to the polling station at which the vote was recorded or was not authorized to vote at the station; if the vote was obtained by bribery, treating or undue influence; if the voter committed or induced someone to commit the offence of personation; and if the vote was for a disqualified candidate and the disqualification was either a matter that the voter was aware of or was sufficiently publicized or widely known. During a scrutiny, a tendered vote that is shown to be valid will be added to the poll if any party to the proceedings asks for the vote to be added. On the other hand, a registered elector's vote will not be struck off at a scrutiny just because he or she was not qualified to be on the electoral register, and the returning officer's decision {{as to whether or not}} a ballot paper should be rejected may not be questioned.|$|E
25|$|In September 2008, some Democrats accused Barbour {{of trying}} to {{influence}} {{the outcome of the}} 2008 Senate race by placing the candidates at the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot.</b> Since Mississippi electoral law mandates the placing of federal elections at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot,</b> Barbour was ordered by a circuit court to comply with the ballot laws.|$|E
25|$|The Atiku Abubakar Campaign Organisation {{claimed that}} the INEC {{deliberately}} left 70 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> papers in a warehouse in Johannesburg, South Africa. They {{claimed that the}} contractors could have freighted the entire 200-ton consignment into the country {{three days before the}} election (Thursday) but the INEC told them to bring only 30 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> papers.|$|E
25|$|Those partial {{figures of}} 550,000 votes from 10% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polling stations, when extrapolated, could suggest a {{national}} turnout of 5.5 million, {{which would be}} about 30% lower than the turnout figures from the previous presidential election in 2004. The tally was based mainly on returns {{in the north and}} other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country – the commission said that less than 2% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> in Kandahar province and none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> from Helmand province had been tallied.|$|R
50|$|After {{processing}} all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballots,</b> <b>the</b> State Election Commission {{announced that}} 65.87% voted yes, 33.51% no and 0.57% of ballots were disregarded as invalid. 37.9% of eligible voters have voted.|$|R
50|$|Cuellar {{defeated}} Hayward, 112,262 (68 percent) to 49,095 (30 percent). Hisel polled 2 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vote, and a Green Party candidate {{held the}} remaining 1 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballots.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{second part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> listed names of {{prospective}} delegates who {{were standing on}} behalf of the various leadership candidates.|$|E
25|$|The {{top part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> listed {{the names of}} each of the {{leadership}} candidates; party members could vote for a candidate or remain undeclared.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{registered}} voter finds his/her {{name in the}} voters' list and locates the correct precinct, he may queue {{in line for the}} distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot.</b>|$|E
25|$|Figures {{released}} by the IEC on August 31, when <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> from almost half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country's polling stations had been counted, pointed to a turnout of only 30% to 35%. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> counted to that point were from <b>the</b> north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country.|$|R
50|$|Cardinal Antoniutti, {{seen as a}} {{compromise}} candidate for the papacy by conservative cardinals, {{is alleged to have}} received about twenty votes during one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> in <b>the</b> conclave <b>of</b> 1963.|$|R
50|$|In 1890, Croft {{was elected}} to the British Columbia Legislature with 146 votes, or 34.27% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballots,</b> {{representing}} <b>the</b> Cowichan region. He served this post for the next four years.|$|R
25|$|Carla Howell, a {{candidate}} for United States Senate in 2000 was the Libertarian Party's candidate for governor. Howell campaigned in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> initiative that would abolish the state's income tax and reducing {{the size of government}} and against bilingual education.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{there was}} a ballot {{question}} asking whether the Reno city government and the Washoe County government should explore the idea of becoming one combined governmental body. Fifty-fourpercent of voters approved <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> measure to make an inquiry into consolidating the governments.|$|E
25|$|A disinterested voter who {{has formed}} no {{personal}} preference may simply number {{all the candidates}} sequentially, 1, 2, 3, etc., {{from top to bottom}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> paper, a practice termed donkey voting, which advantages those candidates whose names are placed nearest to the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> paper. Before 1984, candidates were listed in alphabetical order, which led to a profusion of Aaronses and Abbotts contesting elections. A notable example was the 1937 Senate election, in which the Labor candidate group in New South Wales consisted of Amour, Ashley, Armstrong and Arthur—all of whom were elected. Since 1984, the listed order of candidates on the ballot paper has been determined by drawing lots, a ceremony performed publicly by electoral officials immediately after the appointed time for closure of nominations.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, he {{received}} 6 Hall of Fame votes. This accounted for 1.1% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballots,</b> failing {{to reach the}} 5% threshold necessary to stay on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> for another year. However, he can be elected to <b>the</b> Hall <b>of</b> Fame by <b>the</b> Committee <b>of</b> Baseball Veterans.|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> {{counting}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballots,</b> Arturo Pacificador won as the assemblyman for Antique. But Javier {{asked to}} rebuke <b>the</b> decision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commission due to suspicions <b>of</b> compromising <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elections.|$|R
25|$|On Super Tuesday, March 2, Kucinich gained another {{strong showing}} with the Minnesota caucus, where 17% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> went to him. In {{his home state}} of Ohio, he {{received}} 9% in the primary.|$|R
25|$|This {{surge in}} related {{initiatives}} reflects the rising influence of political activists who coordinate {{the production and}} advocacy of state ballot initiatives on a national level. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> initiatives in the following table (in numerous states) have been financed by New York libertarian Howie Rich and groups he is involved with, most notably Americans for Limited Government.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{said that}} voters who favor a {{developed}} {{version of the}} current status of Puerto Rico (a commonwealth {{which is part of the}} United States with internal self-government) had no alternatives on the ballot. As a result, leaders of the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) instructed such voters to leave the second portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> blank, or to invalidate the ballot.|$|E
25|$|First Week of May - Smartmatic-TIM {{recalls the}} Compact Flash Cards (CFC) of all Precinct Count Optical Scanner (PCOS) Machines {{due to the}} {{machines}} not counting the votes correctly due to the spacing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot.</b> These were found out after testing. By Election Day, 99% of all CF Cards were already delivered. The remaining 1% was due to some inaccessible precincts.|$|E
50|$|During the 1860 Presidential Election, Pennsylvania {{voted in}} favor of Abraham Lincoln (268,030 votes or 56.3% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> cast) over Stephen Douglas (178,765; 37.5%), John C. Breckinridge (16,765; 3.5%), and John Bell (12,776; 2.7%).|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} voting scheme in which shares <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> {{are sent to}} {{multiple}} talliers. The talliers operate in parallel and cooperate together to count <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> by using <b>the</b> technique <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Secure Multiparty Computations (SMPC) in the Virtual Ideal Functionality Framework (VIFF). The counting process is fair since no single tallier can gain knowledge about <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> or can count <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> without cooperating with other talliers...|$|R
25|$|All discussions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>balloting</b> are speculative. On <b>the</b> first <b>ballot,</b> {{according}} to <b>the</b> Italian daily Il Messaggero, Carlo Maria Martini, <b>the</b> archbishop <b>of</b> Milan, obtained 40 votes, Ratzinger obtained 38 votes, and Camillo Ruini {{a substantial number}} <b>of</b> votes, <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> votes being dispersed.|$|R
