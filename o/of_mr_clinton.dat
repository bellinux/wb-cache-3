500|$|An inaugural celebration {{was held}} for US President-elect Bill Clinton in January 1993. The event was staged by Clinton's Hollywood friends at the Lincoln Memorial and drew {{hundreds}} of thousands of people. Aretha Franklin, LL Cool J, Michael Bolton and Tony Bennett were among some of the musicians in attendance. Said Jones, [...] "I've never seen so many great performers come together with so much love and selflessness." [...] The celebration included a performance of [...] "We Are the World", which involved Clinton, his daughter Chelsea, and his wife Hillary singing the song along with USA for Africa's Kenny Rogers, Diana Ross and Michael Jackson. The New York Times Edward Rothstein commented on the event, stating, [...] "The most enduring image may be <b>of</b> <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton</b> singing along in 'We Are the World', the first President to aspire, however futilely, to hipness." ...|$|E

The day before the American election, while the Belgian press unanimously predicted a large victory <b>of</b> <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton,</b> Modrikamen published an interview in the Belgian press declaring that 'Trump would win the American election by K.O.' on the next day. Modrikamen has declared in various interviews that after Brexit and the election of Trump, the populist movement would become global and that also in Europe time has arrived to give a voice back to ordinary people.|$|R

After breaking the Clinton email story, Media Matters's founder and chairman, David Brock, wrote an open letter to The New York Times about the story, [...] "prominent correction as soon as possible" [...] about the story. The Times did not run a correction.

40|$|A satire {{condemning the}} duplicity and {{conspiracy}} of the "Bucktail" faction of New York Democrats in their April 1824 ouster of New York's ex-governor DeWitt Clinton {{from his post}} as canal commissioner. The Library's impression of the print has the missing letters {{in the names of}} the figures filled in by hand. Twelve men stand in a room, with a platform, table, and lamp on the right. On the left G[ardiner] is about to exit saying, "I will run home and ask the people how they will like it before I give my vote. " To the left of the platform P[ierson] says to B[ourne], "I hope we shall give you a united vote for the removal <b>of</b> <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton</b> I have long wished an opportunity to have revenge on him for blowing up the old Burr Conspiracy. " B[ourne]: "I am delighted with the prospect! Clinton has always been my devil [...] it will be impossible to pull him down to our level if we do not dishonor him. I recommend secrecy as success depends upon our taking the members by surprise at the moment of adjournment. " Others in the room speak (counterclockwise, from the far left) : S[eama]n: "I beg of you to pause ere you adopt any more lobby measures [...] we were sent here for public good [...] yet all our measures have for their object individual benefit. This base deed will produce a reaction and may make him Governor. The republican party so justly famed for justice and liberality will in their haste to free themselves from this odium forget and forgive everything. " M[ors]e: "The North river squad think the Canal a benefit to ourside [sic] of the City and they will therefore disapprove our dishonoring its founder. " D[rake]: "I wish I could be excused from voting, my conscience tells me it is wrong my judgment tells me it will dishonor the State [...] but the lobby requires it and it must be done. " H[yatt]: "I vote here against the measure but if a majority of this meeting decide in its favor I will vote for it in the house tomorrow as my creed is the majority must rule. " B[enedict]: "It is inconsistant with a Soldiers honor to build up or pull down any man to gratify angry or sordid passions [...] besides this lobby influence must be check'd or it will ruin the State. " [Henry] W[heaton]: "I will support the measure to punish him for the injury he did our profession by recommending the fee bill and extending the jurisdiction of the judges. " [Clarkson] C[rolius]: "I will support the measure in hopes of appeasing the wrath of the Bucktails altho' I fear they are too hard baked to be gull'd in this way. Besides My Insurance Co. & the lobby. " W[ar]d: "My vote shall be given for this removal because {{he is the author of}} all our troubles about the electoral law.

60|$|At the {{beginning}} <b>of</b> August, <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> was accustomed, {{with his wife}} and family, to desert the sultry populousness of London for the solitude and sea air of Ramsgate. He read the Daily Telegraph by the sad sea waves, and made castles in the sand with his children. Then he changed his pepper-and-salt trousers for white flannel, but nothing on earth would induce him to forsake his top hat. He entirely agreed with the heroes of England's proudest epoch--of course I mean the middle Victorian--that the top hat was the sign-manual, the mark, the distinction of the true Englishman, the completest expression <b>of</b> England's greatness. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> despised all foreigners, and although he would never have ventured to think of himself in the same breath with an English lord, he felt himself the superior of any foreign nobleman.|$|R
5000|$|Correct the Record, {{which started}} as a {{campaign}} of American Bridge 21st Century, spun off as a separate super PAC in May 2015. Though super PACs are typically prohibited from coordinating with campaigns, Correct the Record coordinates with the Clinton campaign on digital content. A spokeswoman for the super PAC said [...] "the coordination restriction would not apply because Correct the Record's defense <b>of</b> <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> would be built around material posted on the group's own website, not paid media." [...] In April 2016, Correct the Record announced it would spend $1 million to find and confront social media users who post unflattering messages about Clinton. In September 2016, Correct the Record announced a project called [...] "Trump Leaks." [...] Correct the Record says it will pay anonymous tipsters for unflattering scoops about Donald Trump, including audio and video recordings and internal documents.|$|R
50|$|He was the Democrats' {{chief counsel}} (1995-1996) on the Senate Whitewater Committee which {{investigated}} {{a variety of}} allegations involving Bill and Hillary Clinton. He argued effectively that the Clintons did no wrong in connection with their investment in a failed land development project named Whitewater, or in their other Arkansas business affairs, nor did they commit violations <b>of</b> law after <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton</b> became president.|$|R

60|$|The {{weather was}} cold and grey, and a drizzling rain was falling. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> did not take a 'bus, since by walking he could put in his pocket the threepence which he meant to charge the firm for his fare. The streets were wet and muddy, and people walked close against the houses to avoid the splash <b>of</b> passing vehicles. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> thought <b>of</b> the jocose {{solicitor}} {{who was in the}} habit of taking an articled clerk with him on muddy days, to walk {{on the outside of the}} street and protect his master from the flying mud. The story particularly appealed to Mr Clinton; that solicitor must have been a fine man of business. As he walked leisurely along under his umbrella, <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> looked without envy upon the city men who drove along in hansoms.|$|R
2500|$|Clinton {{has been}} criticized for not giving credit to a ghostwriter in {{connection}} with It Takes a Village. [...] The majority of the book was reportedly written by ghostwriter Barbara Feinman. When the book was first announced in April 1995, The New York Times reported publisher Simon & Schuster as saying [...] "The book will actually be written by Barbara Feinman, a journalism professor at Georgetown University in Washington. Ms. Feinman will conduct a series <b>of</b> interviews with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton,</b> who will help edit the resulting text." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> became daily stronger, {{and soon}} he was quite well. He resumed {{his work at the}} office, and in every way seemed to have regained his old self. He gave {{utterance}} to no more startling theories, and the casual observer might have noticed no difference between him and the model clerk of six months back. But <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> had received too great a shock to look upon her husband with casual eyes, and she noticed in his manner an alteration which disquieted her. He was much more silent than before; he would take his supper without speaking a word, without making the slightest sign to show that he had heard some remark <b>of</b> <b>Mrs</b> Clinton's. He did not read the paper in the evening as he had been used to do, but would go upstairs {{to the top of the}} house, and stand by an open window looking at the stars. He had an enigmatical way <b>of</b> smiling which <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> could not understand. Then he had lost his old punctuality--he would come home at all sorts of hours, and, when his wife questioned him, would merely shrug his shoulders and smile strangely. Once he told her that he had been wandering about looking at men's lives.|$|R
60|$|No {{question}} as to which of the Clintons is the legitimate son of the captain and his wife has ever again troubled them. Edgar and Rupert {{know that they are}} equally dear to those at home, and all are happy in the knowledge that nothing henceforth can break the closeness of their tie, and that it can never be known which is the lawful heir of the estates. What is much more important to them both, neither of them can say which has the first claim on the love and affection <b>of</b> Captain and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton,</b> and <b>of</b> their sister.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{went back}} to the office; it was his boast that for ten years he had never missed a day. But he was dazed; he did his work mechanically, and so distracted was he that, on going home in the evening, he forgot to remove his paper cuffs, and his wife remarked upon them while they were supping. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> was a short, stout person, with an {{appearance}} of immense determination; her black, shiny hair was parted in the middle--the parting was broad and very white--severely brushed back and gathered into a little knot {{at the back of the}} head; her face was red and strongly lined, her eyes spirited, her nose aggressive, her mouth resolute. Everyone has some one procedure which seems most exactly to suit him--a slim youth bathing in a shaded stream, an alderman standing with his back to the fire and his thumbs in the arm-holes <b>of</b> his waistcoat--and <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> expressed her complete self, exhibiting every trait and attribute, on Sunday in church, when she sat in the front pew self-reliantly singing the hymns in the wrong key. It was then that she seemed more than ever the personification of a full stop. Her morals were above suspicion, and her religion Low Church.|$|R
50|$|On 18 October 1991, the IOGKF held a Goju-Ryu Karate Technical Seminar and All America Tournament in Arkansas in the USA, with Morio Higaonna Sensei {{presiding}} over the event as the Chief Instructor and lecturer. Morio Higaonna Sensei was awarded a commendation by the Governor <b>of</b> Arkansas, <b>Mr.</b> Bill <b>Clinton</b> (later the President of the United States of America). The following day, the Mayor of Fort Smith, Arkansas, designated 18 October (the day on which the IOGKF seminar was held) as “Morio Higaonna Day”, and made Morio Higaonna Sensei a Honorary Citizen of Fort Smith City.|$|R
60|$|All night <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> tossed {{from side}} to side; the heat was unbearable, and he threw off the clothes. His restlessness became so great that {{he got out of}} bed and walked up and down the room--a pathetically ridiculous object in his flannel nightshirt, from which his thin legs {{protruded}} grotesquely. Going back to bed, he fell into an uneasy sleep; but waking or sleeping, he had before his eyes the faces of the three horrible bodies he had seen at the mortuary. He could not blot out the image of the thin, baby face with the pale, open eyes, the white face drawn and thin, hideous in its starved, dead shapelessness. And he saw the drawn, wrinkled face of the old man, with the stubbly beard; looking at it, he felt the long pain of hunger, the agony of the hopeless morrow. But he shuddered with terror at the thought of the drowned girl with the sunken eyes, the horrible discolouration <b>of</b> putrefaction; and <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> buried his face in his pillow, sobbing, sobbing very silently so as not to wake his wife....|$|R

60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{arrived at}} the mortuary, a gay red and white building, which had been newly erected and consecrated by a duke with much festivity and rejoicing. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> was sworn with the other jurymen, and with them {{repaired}} to see the bodies on which they were to sit. But <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> was squeamish.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton,</b> as before, {{had gone}} out, but <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{did her best}} to {{entertain}} the two doctors. The specialist, who talked most incessantly himself, was extremely impatient of other people's conversation.|$|R
60|$|The morning came at {{last and}} found him feverish and parched, unable to move. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> sent for the doctor, a slow, {{cautious}} Scotchman, in whose wisdom <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> implicitly relied, since he always agreed with her own idea of her children's ailments. This prudent gentleman ventured to assert that <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> had caught cold and had something wrong with his lungs. Then, promising to send medicine and come again next day, went off on his rounds. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> grew worse; he became delirious. When his wife, smoothing his pillow, {{asked him how he}} felt, he looked at her with glassy eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{crossed her}} hands over her stomach and looked at her husband with self-satisfaction. But <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> was awake, staring in front of him with wide-open, fixed eyes; various {{thoughts}} confusedly ran through his head.|$|R
60|$|The Clintons {{lived in}} the fifth house down in the Adonis Road, {{and the house was}} {{distinguishable}} from its fellows by the yellow curtains with which <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> had furnished all the windows. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> was a woman of taste. Before marriage, the happy pair, accompanied by Mrs Clinton's mother, had gone house-hunting, and fixed on the Adonis Road, which was cheap, respectable and near the station. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> would dearly have liked a house on the right-hand side of the road, which had nooks and angles and curiously-shaped windows. But <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> was firm in his refusal, and his mother-in-law backed him up.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton,</b> in fact, became worse. He {{came home}} later and later every night, {{and his wife}} was disgusted {{at the state of}} uncleanness which his curious wanderings brought about. He refused to take the baths which <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{prepared}} for him. He was more silent than ever, but when he spoke it was in biblical language; and always hovered on his lips the enigmatical smile, and his eyes always had the strange, disconcerting look. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> perseveringly made him take his medicine, but she lost faith in its power when, one night at twelve, <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> brought home with him a very dirty, ragged man, who looked half-starved and smelt distinctly alcoholic.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I never!' said <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton,</b> quite aghast; and as {{she walked}} by the flower girl, snorted at her and looked so savagely that the poor little maiden quite started. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> walked very slowly, {{stopping}} {{now and then to}} look at a couple of women seated on a doorstep, or the children round an ice-cream stall. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> saw him pay a penny and give an ice to a little child who was looking with longing eyes at its more fortunate companions as they licked out the little glass cups. He remained quite a long while watching half a dozen young girls dancing to the music of a barrel organ, and again, to his wife's disgust, <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> gave money.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> looked helplessly at her friend; {{she feared}} {{something}} was wrong, and she didn't {{know what to}} do.

[...] Guy Cecil, the former political director <b>of</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Clinton's campaign, said it was [...] "insulting" [...] for Republicans to compare Ms. Palin to Mrs. Clinton." [...] The Saturday Night Live skit [...] "A Nonpartisan Message from Governor Sarah Palin & Senator Hillary Clinton" [...] counterpoised Palin, played by Tina Fey, against Hillary Clinton, played by Amy Poehler. The skit pointed out their opposing political views and presented Palin as unversed in global politics, as emphasized by the line: [...] "I can see Russia from my house." [...] Ex-Hewlett-Packard chief executive and former McCain advisor Carly Fiorina blasted the Saturday Night Live sketch in a television interview: [...] "They were defining Hillary Clinton as very substantive and Sarah Palin as totally superficial," [...] and an ABC news blog headline soon after ran, [...] "Now the McCain Campaign's Complaining that Saturday Night Live Skit Was 'Sexist'." ...|$|R
