5|$|Over the winter, with Test {{vacancies}} beckoning, Davidson and Benaud became training {{partners and}} decided to bowl for three hours continuously {{on a daily basis}} through the winter <b>off</b> <b>season.</b> With Ray Lindwall dropped, Davidson and Benaud became Australia's leading paceman and spinner when the team for the 1957–58 tour of South Africa was announced.

The team was to be led by Ian Craig, who had played only six Tests, and at the age of just 22 years, he was the youngest ever Test captain from any country.|$|E

Rogers died of a cocaine overdose leaving the team without one of its best defenders in the secondary for the 1986 season. Despite the tumultuous <b>off</b> <b>season,</b> 1986 marked Cleveland's entry into the ranks of the NFL's elite as Kosar's play improved and the defensive unit came together. Kosar threw for 3,854yards to a corps of receivers that included Brian Brennan, Newsome and rookie Webster Slaughter. On defense, cornerbacks Frank Minnifield and Hanford Dixon {{emerged as one of the}} NFL's premiere pass-defending duos. After a slow start, the Browns rose to the top of the divisional standings, twice beating the Pittsburgh Steelers and ending a 16-game losing streak at Three Rivers Stadium. A 12–4 record earned Cleveland home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|Since 2001, Hamar Olympic Amphitreatre {{has hosted}} the annual Idrettsgallaen, a {{television}} show that honors the past year's Norwegian sports and athlete achievements. Hamar was selected to host the event because its main sponsor, the national lottery company Norsk Tipping, has its head office in Hamar. Idrettsgallaen is held in early January, when many of winter sports athletes are home and the summer athletes are <b>off</b> <b>season.</b> In 2010, Idrettsgallaen was hosted in Lillehammer because the weekend crashed with the 2010 European Speed Skating Championships in Vikingskipet and Hamar lacks sufficient hotel capacity to host both simultaneously. Concerts hosted at the arena since the opening concert with Fats Domino on 25 November 1992 include Little Richard in 1993, Vamp in 2005, Willie Nelson in 2008 and José Carreras in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The media stridently criticised Miller's omission, as did {{former players}} such as Stan McCabe and Alan Kippax. During the <b>off</b> <b>season,</b> {{he worked as a}} {{journalist}} and played baseball, but declined a trial with a Major League Baseball club, the Boston Red Sox. Miller captained New South Wales {{at the start of the}} 1949–50 season as his colleagues went to South Africa, his first leadership experience in the Sheffield Shield. He scored 80 and took six wickets in the first match against Queensland. After another victory over Western Australia, he received a request from the Australian Board of Control. At the request of captain Hassett, Miller was asked to tour South Africa as cover for Johnston, who had been injured in a car crash. Miller accepted the offer and resigned himself to bowling heavily. Miller almost missed the trip after arriving late at the dock in Perth after a drunken night. The next boat to South Africa would not have departed for several weeks. Despite his recall, there remained tension over his initial omission, as Dwyer was the team manager.|$|E
