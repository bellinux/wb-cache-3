5|$|Aside {{from the}} large nasal horn and four long frill spikes, the cranial {{ornamentation}} was variable. Some individuals had small hook-like projections and knobs at the posterior margin of the frill, similar to but smaller than those in Centrosaurus. <b>Others</b> <b>had</b> less prominent tabs. Some, like the type individual, had a third pair of long frill spikes. <b>Others</b> <b>had</b> much smaller projections, and small points are found on the side margins of some but not all specimens. Modest pyramid-shaped brow horns were present in subadults, but were replaced by pits in adults. Like most ceratopsids, Styracosaurus had large fenestrae (skull openings) in its frill. The front of the mouth had a toothless beak.|$|E
5|$|Involuntary {{manslaughter}} {{involves the}} causing {{of the death}} of another person without intent to kill or intention to commit grievous bodily harm. Some cases are in form similar to murder cases; whilst, in <b>others,</b> <b>had</b> death not been caused, the defendant would only be liable for an insignificant crime.|$|E

With some young ladies he is 'a perfect angel,' {{and with others}} 'quite a love.' He is likewise a charming creature, a duck, and a dear.|$|R

5|$|The {{resulting}} financial pressure {{meant that}} little rebuilding occurred until 1906, {{and when it}} resumed Balfour's influence was diminished.

5|$|A 1997 {{survey of}} early astronomical records and {{drawings}} {{suggested that a}} certain dark surface feature discovered by astronomer Giovanni Cassini in 1690 {{may have been an}} impact scar. The survey initially produced eight more candidate sites as potential impact observations that he and <b>others</b> <b>had</b> recorded between 1664 and 1839. It was later determined, however, that these candidate sites had little or no possibility of being the results of the proposed impacts.|$|E

In his biography, Chrisye noted that he enjoyed eating at roadside foodstalls well after his marriage and would be perplexed when people stared at him. Guruh recalled that Chrisye would sleep anywhere during extended planning sessions, including under the piano.|$|E
5|$|All {{families}} {{had their own}} gardens in which they grew vegetables that lasted through the winter. Some raised cows, pigs and chickens; <b>others</b> <b>had</b> horses for carrying firewood. There was little refrigeration, and perishables were difficult to keep. Before the mercantile came to Elcor, residents went to the J. P. Ahlin store in McKinley, or to the Saari, Campbell and Kraker Mercantile in Gilbert. Deliveries were made daily, with orders taken for the following day. People bought on credit and paid monthly, on paydays.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crowd}} began {{making their way}} home from Ninian Park, the news began to filter slowly out. Some Scottish fans had elected to remain in Cardiff and were celebrating the {{achievement}} of guaranteeing the play-off spot when they saw and heard what had happened. <b>Others</b> <b>had</b> boarded trains or were in cars heading home – many fans didn't hear the news until they eventually got home the following day.|$|E

Chat Moss also contains the largest block of semi-natural woodland in Greater Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{had only}} {{recently}} arrived {{in some of these}} kingdoms. Some had been converted by the Gregorian mission, a group of Roman missionaries who arrived in Kent in 597 and who mainly influenced southern Britain. <b>Others</b> <b>had</b> been converted by the Hiberno-Scottish mission, chiefly Irish missionaries working in Northumbria and neighbouring kingdoms. A few kingdoms, such as Dál Riata, became Christian but how they did so is unknown. The native Picts, according to the medieval writer Bede, were converted in two stages, initially by native Britons under Ninian, and subsequently by Irish missionaries.|$|E
5|$|Controlled {{experiments}} with colonies of Cerapachys biroi suggest {{that an individual}} may choose nest roles based on her previous experience. An entire generation of identical workers was {{divided into two groups}} whose outcome in food foraging was controlled. One group was continually rewarded with prey, while it was made certain that the other failed. As a result, members of the successful group intensified their foraging attempts while the unsuccessful group ventured out fewer and fewer times. A month later, the successful foragers continued in their role while the <b>others</b> <b>had</b> moved to specialise in brood care.|$|E

5|$|De León later rescued L'Archeveque and his {{companion}} Jacques Grollet. On interrogation, the men maintained that over 100 of the French settlers {{had died of}} smallpox, and the <b>others</b> <b>had</b> been killed by Native Americans. The only people known to have survived the final attack were the Talon children, who had been adopted by the Karankawa. According to the children, the settlement had been attacked around Christmas of 1688, and all the remaining settlers had been killed.|$|E
5|$|Despite this he {{had neither}} an office nor office staff, {{dealing with all}} the {{correspondence}} himself. Much of the detail of his works were held in his memory. He travelled with a personal valet and later had a cashier. But all his letters were written by him; it is recorded that on one occasion after {{the rest of his}} party had gone to bed, 31 letters had been written by Brassey overnight. Although he won a large number of contracts, his bids were not always successful. It has been calculated that for every contract awarded, around six <b>others</b> <b>had</b> been unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Following the 15th century Reformation when {{clerical}} {{marriage was}} permitted, larger households {{would have been}} required {{and as a result}} some of the houses were altered and combined by knocking through walls, into larger dwellings. <b>Others</b> <b>had</b> extensions built to the rear. Water supply was originally from two wells, one {{at each end of the}} close. By 1468 lead pipes had been installed to bring water into the houses, although the wells continued to function until the 19th century. Number 22 is the house which still has most of its original medieval structure as it was originally built.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{demolition}} of the tomb's chamber, some of the sarsens around the monument had been buried, while <b>others</b> <b>had</b> been left visible. Various buildings in Addington are partly made out of sarsen stone, {{some of which may}} have been removed from the long barrow. Ashbee also suspected that sarsens from this monument had been broken up for use in the repairs and extensions to the local church in the nineteenth century. The barrow was further damaged by the construction of the small road running through the middle of it.|$|E

While some divisions were sent overseas <b>others</b> <b>had</b> to remain in India guarding the North West Frontier and on internal security and training duties.|$|E
