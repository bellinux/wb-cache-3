5|$|Languages evolve and diversify over time, and {{the history}} of their {{evolution}} can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family. The Indo-European family is the most widely spoken and includes languages as diverse as English, Russian and Hindi; the Sino-Tibetan family, which includes Mandarin, Bodo and the other Chinese languages, and Tibetan; the Afro-Asiatic family, which includes Arabic, Somali, and Hebrew; the Bantu languages, which include Swahili, and Zulu, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout Africa; and the Malayo-Polynesian languages, which include Indonesian, Malay, Tagalog, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout the Pacific. The languages of the Dravidian family that are spoken mostly in Southern India include Tamil and Telugu. Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> spoken {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century will probably have become extinct by the year 2100.|$|E

50|$|Differently {{from most}} other {{approaches}} in linguistics, Integrational Linguistics emphasizes {{a distinction between}} theories <b>of</b> <b>language</b> and theories <b>of</b> <b>language</b> descriptions.

40|$|The {{creative}} aspect <b>of</b> <b>language</b> use {{provides a}} set of phenomena that a science <b>of</b> <b>language</b> must explain.

Therefore, the form and explanatory depth of linguistic science is restricted in accordance with this aspect <b>of</b> <b>language.</b> In this paper, {{the implications of the}} creative aspect <b>of</b> <b>language</b> use for a scientific theory <b>of</b> <b>language</b> will be discussed, noting the possible further implications for a science of the mind. It will be argued that a corollary of the creative aspect <b>of</b> <b>language</b> use is that a science <b>of</b> <b>language</b> can study the mechanisms that make language use possible, but that such a science cannot explain how these mechanisms enter into human action in the form <b>of</b> <b>language</b> use...|$|R

5|$|Formal {{schooling}} did {{not start}} in Hungary {{until the age of}} ten. Instead, governesses taught von Neumann, his brothers and his cousins.

By the age of 8, von Neumann was familiar with differential and integral calculus, but he was particularly interested in history, reading his way through Wilhelm Oncken's 46-volume Allgemeine Geschichte in Einzeldarstellungen.

Consistent with his other writing, Clement affirms that philosophy had a propaedeutic role for the Greek, similar to the function of the law for the Jews. He then embarks on a discussion of the origins of Greek culture and technology, arguing that most of the important figures in the Greek world were foreigners, and (erroneously) that Jewish culture was the most significant influence on Greece. In an attempt to demonstrate the primacy of Moses, Clement gives an extended chronology of the world, wherein he dates the birth of Christ to 25 April or May, 4-2 B.C., and the creation of the world to 5592 B.C.
