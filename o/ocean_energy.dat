According to an Associated Press investigation, certain safety documentation and emergency procedure information, including documentation for the exact incident that later occurred, was absent. The exact number of required monthly inspections performed varied over time; the inspections were carried out as required for the first 40 months, but after that around 25% of inspections were omitted, although the investigation notes this is partly expected, since there are circumstances such as weather and movement which preclude an inspection.

40|$|<b>Ocean</b> {{renewable}} <b>energy</b> (ORE) presents one of {{the most}} abundant, reliable, yet untapped sources of clean energy available to date. With a vast array of potential extraction possibilities including wave energy, tidal <b>energy</b> and <b>ocean</b> current <b>energy,</b> the evolvement of the technologies has not seen the same growth as other renewable energy sectors such as wind and solar. This lack of technological growth can be partially attributed to the high Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE) currently associated with <b>ocean</b> renewable <b>energy,</b> which presents a measure of a power source over its operational lifetime relative to the average total associated costs. This factor, in culmination with the relatively low matureness of technologies compared to wind and solar, has impeded the development of full-scale or commercial <b>ocean</b> renewable <b>energy</b> concepts. One application devised to combat the high levelised cost of electricity associated with <b>ocean</b> renewable <b>energy,</b> specifically <b>ocean</b> wave <b>energy</b> is the implementation of wave energy converters (WECs) into pre-existing or in-development maritime structures, such as harbour seawalls or breakwaters.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to briefly review the state-of-the-art in the harnessing of marine energy and study the positions and features of the boundary and domestic seas and lakes of Iran from energy point of view and the possibility of using these energy resources. Generally, the energy potentials in the seas and oceans are classified in five groups: wave <b>energy,</b> tidal <b>energy,</b> <b>ocean</b> thermal <b>energy,</b> <b>ocean</b> current <b>energy,</b> and salinity gradient energy. Due to the variety of Iran's bodies of water, other than <b>ocean</b> current <b>energy,</b> it is possible to use the rest of these energy resources. Each body of water of Iran is suitable for a specific kind of marine energy. There are great sources of tidal energy in the Persian Gulf coasts. For thermal energy, the ideal sites are located in the Caspian Sea coasts, and wave energy can economically be extracted in the Gulf of Oman coasts as well as in remote islands which are off-grid. Finally, Urmia Lake is the best location for salinity gradient energy. This study shows that more investment is required in this area for research and small scale pilot plants in order to exploit such renewable resources.

25|$|Marine {{energy or}} marine power (also {{sometimes}} referred to as <b>ocean</b> <b>energy,</b> ocean power, or marine and hydrokinetic energy) refers to the energy carried by ocean waves, tides, salinity, and ocean temperature differences.

The movement of water in the world's oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy, or energy in motion. This energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes, transport and industries. The term marine energy encompasses both wave powerpower from surface waves, and tidal powerobtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water. Reverse electrodialysis (RED) is a technology for generating electricity by mixing fresh river water and salty sea water in large power cells designed for this purpose; as of 2016 it is being tested at a small scale (50 kW). Offshore wind power is not a form of marine energy, as wind power is derived from the wind, even if the wind turbines are placed over water.

In the oceans the temperature difference between surface and deep water is greatest in the tropics, although still a modest 20 to 25°C. It is therefore in the tropics that OTEC offers the greatest possibilities. OTEC {{has the potential to}} offer global amounts of energy that are 10 to 100 times greater than other <b>ocean</b> <b>energy</b> options such as wave power. OTEC plants can operate continuously providing a base load supply for an electrical power generation system.|$|E

MHK development in U.S. and international waters includes projects using devices such as, wave energy converters in open coastal areas with significant waves, tidal turbines placed in coastal and estuarine areas, in-stream turbines in fast-moving rivers, ocean current turbines in areas of strong marine currents, and ocean thermal energy converters in deep tropical waters.|$|E

40|$|Mixtures offer {{potential}} advantages over pure compounds as working fluids in <b>ocean</b> thermal <b>energy</b> conversion cycles. Power plant capital costs {{per unit of}} energy output can be reduced using mixtures because of increased thermal efficiency and/or decreased heat exchanger size requirements. Mixtures also potentially offer the advantage of improved performance characteristics under conditions of progressive fouling of heat exchangers. Potentially, {{a significant portion of}} the world's future energy needs can be supplied by <b>ocean</b> thermal <b>energy</b> (1). In <b>ocean</b> thermal <b>energy</b> conversion schemes, the objective is to utilize the 30 to 40 F temperature differences between warm surface sea water and cold (1000 to 2000 feet deep) sea water which occur in numerous regions in the oceans. The utilization of these ocean temperature differences for power generation was proposed before 1900 by D'Arsonval (1). An open steam cycle for <b>ocean</b> thermal <b>energy</b> conversion was proven technically but not economically feasible in 1926 by Claude (1). Currently, the closed cycle proposed by Anderson and Anderson (2) is being given major consideration for ocean thermal cycles, partly owing to the fact that use of working fluids such as propane or ammonia leads to small turbine sizes relative to turbine sizes for the open steam cycle. Noteworthy conceptual designs for <b>ocean</b> thermal <b>energy</b> conversion plants have been proposed by Heronemus et al. (3) and Zener (4).
