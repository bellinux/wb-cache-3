50|$|Track {{circuits}} allow railway signalling {{systems to}} operate semi-automatically, by displaying signals for trains {{to slow down}} or stop {{in the presence of}} <b>occupied</b> <b>track</b> ahead of them. They help prevent dispatchers and operators from causing accidents, both by informing them of track occupancy and by preventing signals from displaying unsafe indications.|$|E
50|$|In Canada, non-signaled and Automatic Block Signal (ABS) territories are {{operated}} {{according to}} OCS rules. The only authority for movement in OCS territory is {{possession of a}} Clearance or Track Occupancy Permit (TOP) While the line might be equipped with signals (ABS), these signals are unsupervised and uncontrolled by the Rail Traffic Controller. Their indications are strictly governed by track conditions and the passage of trains, and serve to tell operating crews at what speed to operate, and warn of an <b>occupied</b> <b>track</b> ahead.|$|E

60|$|Clarence, on this sultry August afternoon, was tensely <b>occupied</b> <b>tracking</b> {{the family}} cat across the dining-room carpet by its foot-prints. Glancing {{up for a}} moment, {{he caught sight of}} {{the other members of the}} family.|$|R
50|$|The {{timetable}} {{system had}} several disadvantages. The first {{was that there}} was no positive confirmation that the track ahead was clear; only that it should be clear. This system did not allow for breakdowns and other such problems. The timetable was set up {{in such a way that}} there should be sufficient time between trains for the crew of a broken-down or delayed train to walk back up the line far enough to set up warning flags, fusees and explosive devices known as torpedoes, which alerted a train crew to an <b>occupied</b> <b>track</b> ahead.|$|E
50|$|ATB {{works by}} sending {{electrical}} signals through the track. After passing a red signal and entering a section already occupied by another train, the track circuit is shorted {{by the other}} train {{and there is no}} signal any more. Therefore, the absence of a signal should be interpreted as the most restrictive signal, making the system fail-safe. To allow driving on sections not equipped with ATB or driving on sight onto <b>occupied</b> <b>track,</b> which cannot be discerned from passing a red signal using a system like this, this most restrictive electrical signal was defined as representing a speed limit of 40 km/h. The main purpose of ATB was to prevent overspeeding and failing to respond to yellow signals, as it was deemed unlikely any driver would miss a red signal when already traveling slower than 40 km/h and expecting one. As safety regulations have become stricter over time, it is seen as a problem now.|$|E
40|$|Underpasses {{are common}} in modern railway lines. Wildlife {{corridors}} and drainage conduits often fall into this category of partially buried structures. Their dynamic behaviour has received far less attention than that of other structures such as bridges, but their large number makes their study an interesting challenge {{in order to achieve}} safe and cost-effective structures. As ballast operations are a key life cycle cost, and excessive vibrations increase the need of ballast regulation in order to ensure track geometry, special attention is paid to accelerations, the values of which should be limited to avoid track instability according to Eurocode. In this paper, the data obtained during on site measurements on culverts belonging to a Spanish high-speed train line are presented. A set of six rectangular-shaped, closed-frame underpasses were monitored under traffic loading. Acceleration records at different points of the structures are presented and discussed. They reveal a non-uniform dynamic response of the roof-slab, with the highest observed values below the <b>occupied</b> <b>track.</b> Also, they indicate that the dynamic response is important up to frequencies higher than those usually observed for standard simply supported bridges. Finally, they are used to obtain a heuristic rule to estimate acceleration levels on the roof-slab...|$|E

50|$|Today, {{the river}} and rails still power the local economy with tourism and shipping. Canadian Pacific Railway and Minnesota Northern Railroad now <b>occupy</b> <b>tracks</b> through town. To this day, Soo Line engine 1024 rests outside city hall (formerly the Soo Line Depot).|$|R
50|$|One {{report in}} the Federal Register in 2004 {{indicated}} that the Federal Railroad Administration recommended that {{in the presence of}} any condition that might impede safe passage of a train, the dispatcher should immediately issue a speed restriction to 20 mph and that signal or track maintainers should be given priority on <b>occupying</b> <b>track</b> for the purpose of investigating a signal system or track component problem.|$|R

50|$|It is {{possible}} to walk or cycle over the entire route of the Jersey Railway as a seafront promenade, cycle track, and walking and cycling trail now <b>occupy</b> the <b>trackbed.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since {{switching}} stations, like substations, normally separate electrical sections {{with different}} supply sources (and thus different phase or voltage), a neutral section always <b>occupies</b> the <b>track</b> {{between the two}} electrical sections.|$|R
50|$|Authority to <b>occupy</b> {{the main}} <b>track</b> is {{dispatched}} via CTC from West St. James to South Butterfield. From there, track warrant control (TWC) is used, {{and it is}} dark territory until Le Mars, Iowa, where automatic block signaling is {{used in conjunction with}} TWC. Union Pacific has trackage rights over CN's track From Le Mars to Sioux City, although UP dispatchers grant the authority to <b>occupy</b> the main <b>track.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{passenger}} train passed Paddock Wood at 20:38½, which was 3½ minutes ahead of time. At that time, the parcels train was <b>occupying</b> <b>track</b> circuit FH. Signal PE129 was showing line clear. The {{passenger train}} cleared track circuits FF and FG, and entered track circuit FH {{which was still}} occupied by the parcels train. The signalman at Ashford sent the [...] "obstruction danger" [...] signal to Tonbridge signal box at 20:42. The parcels train had reached a maximum speed of 15 mph when it was hit from the rear by the passenger train at a closing speed of between 75 mph and 80 mph, having passed signal A322 at caution and signal A324 at danger. Signal A370 was still showing proceed as the parcels train had not reached track circuit FH, which controlled that signal.|$|R
50|$|The station {{formerly}} had two signal {{boxes to}} supervise the passing loop and junction between the two routes - both were however closed in 1985 when the Radio Electronic Token Block system was introduced by British Rail on the Far North Line. The system was initially worked from a control centre at the station, with the line southwards planned {{for inclusion in the}} Inverness area resignalling scheme. However, when the Inverness scheme was completed in 1988, RETB control was transferred to the new signalling centre there and one here was closed. The junction points were altered so that they were (and still are) power operated - drivers of northbound trains use a plunger on the down platform to select the correct route, whilst southbound trains trigger the correct setting by <b>occupying</b> <b>track</b> circuits on the approach to the station.|$|R
5000|$|Railway {{signalling}} {{systems are}} designed to prevent any train from entering a stretch of <b>track</b> <b>occupied</b> by another train. But in the Wenzhou collision, Train D301 ran onto <b>track</b> <b>occupied</b> by Train D3115. This indicates a signal failure. The 28 July 2011 announcement, by the Beijing National Railway Research and Design Institute of Signals and Communication, that signal equipment had a design flaw, {{and that it would}} [...] "shoulder responsibility" [...] for the accident, confirmed that the accident was a result of signal failure.|$|R

50|$|Form D Control System, or DCS, is {{a system}} similar to Track Warrant Control {{that is used by}} railroads subscribing to NORAC (Track Warrant Control is a GCOR term). The name comes from the form that train crews copy the {{authority}} on. A sample Form D is available here; line two is used to grant authority for <b>occupying</b> the <b>track.</b>|$|R
50|$|All trains {{must have}} {{authority}} to <b>occupy</b> a main <b>track.</b> Originally {{possession of a}} timetable which showed a schedule for that train, authorized a train crew to take their movement onto the main track.|$|R

North of the buffer stop a Permissive path, owned and maintained by the railway company, <b>occupies</b> the <b>trackbed</b> towards County School railway station.|$|R
