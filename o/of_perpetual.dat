Marc Handley Andrus, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of California, presiding; some 1,000 mourners {{attended}} the service. Various local and state elected officials participated, including California State Sen.

Leaders of the Imperial Court System and the Sisters <b>of</b> <b>Perpetual</b> Indulgence attended in full regalia, with the formal mourning dress for the court dictated by Sarria in advance. Other dignitaries at the funeral included Stuart Milk, nephew of politician Harvey Milk and head of the Harvey Milk Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Threefold {{repetition}} of position: This most commonly occurs when neither side {{is able to}} avoid repeating moves without incurring a disadvantage. In this situation, either player can claim a draw; this requires the players to keep a valid written record of the game so that the claim can be verified by the arbiter if challenged. The three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for a claim to be valid. FIDE rules make no mention <b>of</b> <b>perpetual</b> check; this is merely {{a specific type of}} draw by threefold repetition.|$|E
5|$|Boston {{has been}} a noted {{religious}} center from its earliest days. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston serves nearly 300 parishes and is based in the Cathedral of the Holy Cross (1875) in the South End, while the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts serves just under 200 congregations, with the Cathedral Church of St. Paul (1819) as its episcopal seat. Unitarian Universalism has its headquarters on Beacon Hill. The Christian Scientists are headquartered in Back Bay at the Mother Church (1894). The oldest church in Boston is First Church in Boston, founded in 1630. King's Chapel was the city's first Anglican church, founded in 1686 and converted to Unitarianism in 1785. Other churches include Christ Church (better known as Old North Church, 1723), the oldest church building in the city, Trinity Church (1733), Park Street Church (1809), Old South Church (1874), Jubilee Christian Church, and Basilica and Shrine of Our Lady <b>of</b> <b>Perpetual</b> Help on Mission Hill (1878).|$|E

5|$|In 1502, James IV of Scotland {{signed the}} Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Perpetual</b> Peace with Henry VII of England. He also married Henry's daughter, Margaret Tudor, {{setting the stage}} for the Union of the Crowns. For Henry, the {{marriage}} into one of Europe's most established monarchies gave legitimacy to the new Tudor royal line. A decade later, James made the fateful decision to invade England in support of France {{under the terms of the}} Auld Alliance. He was the last British monarch to die in battle, at the Battle of Flodden. Within a generation the Auld Alliance was ended by the Treaty of Edinburgh. France agreed to withdraw all land and naval forces. In the same year, 1560, John Knox realised his goal of seeing Scotland become a Protestant nation and the Scottish parliament revoke papal authority in Scotland. Mary, Queen of Scots, a Catholic and former queen of France, was forced to abdicate in 1567.|$|E
5|$|The {{euphotic}} zone is somewhat arbitrarily defined as {{extending from the}} surface to the depth where the light intensity is approximately 0.1–1% of surface sunlight irradiance, depending on season, latitude and degree of water turbidity. In the clearest ocean water, the {{euphotic zone}} may extend {{to a depth of}} about 150metres, or rarely, up to 200metres. Dissolved substances and solid particles absorb and scatter light, and in coastal regions the high concentration of these substances causes light to be attenuated rapidly with depth. In such areas the euphotic zone may be only a few tens of metres deep or less. The dysphotic zone, where light intensity is considerably less than 1% of surface irradiance, extends {{from the base of the}} euphotic zone to about 1000metres. Extending from the bottom of the photic zone down to the seabed is the aphotic zone, a region <b>of</b> <b>perpetual</b> darkness.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruins of}} Jokpo Hermitage (’jog po ri khrod) {{is located in}} the far western end of the Nyang bran Valley. The former {{property}} of the Jokpo Lama’s estate before the Chinese invasion in 1959, it originally served as the meditation retreat of a monk named ’Jog po rin po che of the Sera Mé College. The monk was a great meditator and according to tradition, after he died, his body remained in a state <b>of</b> <b>perpetual</b> meditative equipoise and was kept inside the Zhungpa Regional House temple where the monks reported that his hair and nails continued to grow even after his death. Before the Chinese invasion his body was buried and decayed and when the regional house (khang tshan) was rebuilt in the 1980s, his bones were exhumed. These are today placed inside the altar's clay statue in the regional house temple.|$|E

5|$|From May 1980 {{to early}} 1981 he acted as {{editor for the}} {{magazine}} POL. In 1982, {{he moved to the}} neighbouring state of Victoria, and was appointed the Director of Tourism. This sparked an outcry in South Australia due to the two states' traditional rivalry. For his part, Dunstan said that he had yearned to be given a role in shaping and building the future of his native state, but that he had been snubbed for three years. He said that public figures in South Australia had told him that his high profile and ability to overshadow others could have caused a loss of face to them, and thus his departure would be seen favourably by them, while Victoria's offer gave him an opportunity to be constructive. Dunstan was appointed to the Victorian Economic Development Corporation on 12 July 1983, resigning on 23 June 1986. Dunstan stayed in the Director of Tourism role until 1986, when he returned to Adelaide after falling out with the government of John Cain. His retirement from these positions followed the provocative publication of a photograph of him with Monsignor Porcamadonna, member of the gay community Order <b>of</b> <b>Perpetual</b> Indulgence, taken after he had launched a collection of coming out stories by gay historian Gary Wotherspoon.|$|E
5|$|With the {{ambition}} to become London's sole burial site in perpetuity, the LNC {{were aware that}} if their plans were successful, their Necropolis would become a site of major national importance. As a consequence, the cemetery was designed with attractiveness in mind, {{in contrast to the}} squalid and congested London burial grounds and the newer suburban cemeteries which were already becoming crowded. The LNC aimed to create an atmosphere <b>of</b> <b>perpetual</b> spring in the cemetery, and chose the plants for the cemetery accordingly. It had already been noted that evergreen plants from North America thrived in the local soil. Robert Donald, the owner of an arboretum near Woking, was contracted to supply the trees and shrubs for the cemetery. The railway line through the cemetery and the major roads and paths within the cemetery were lined with giant sequoia trees, the first significant planting of these trees (only introduced to Europe in 1853) in Britain. As well as the giant sequoias, the grounds were heavily planted with magnolia, rhododendron, coastal redwood, azalea, andromeda and monkeypuzzle, with the intention of creating perpetual greenery with large numbers of flowers and a strong floral scent throughout the cemetery.|$|E

25|$|Majority of the {{population}} are Roman Catholics. The city is {{the seat of the}} Vicariates of Immaculate Conception and Our Mother <b>of</b> <b>Perpetual</b> Help under the jurisdiction of Diocese of Imus.|$|E
25|$|The {{doctrine}} <b>of</b> <b>perpetual</b> virginity is also {{distinct from}} the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of Mary, which relates to the conception of the Virgin Mary herself without any stain (macula in Latin) of original sin.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} Our Mother <b>of</b> <b>Perpetual</b> Help. Catholics have, for centuries, prayed before this icon, usually in reproductions, to intercede {{on their behalf}} to Christ. Over the centuries, several churches {{dedicated}} to Our Mother <b>of</b> <b>Perpetual</b> Help have been constructed. Pope John Paul II held mass at the National Shrine of Our Mother <b>of</b> <b>Perpetual</b> Help in the Philippines where the devotion is very popular and many Catholic churches hold a Novena and Mass honoring it every Wednesday using {{a replica of the}} icon, which is also widely displayed in houses, buses and public transport in the Philippines. Devotions to the icon have spread from the Philippines to the United States, and remain popular among Asian-Americans in California. As recently as 1992, the song The Lady Who Wears Blue and Gold was composed in California and then performed at St. Alphonsus Liguori Church in Rome, where the icon resides. This illustrates how a medieval work of art can give rise to feast days, Cathedrals and Marian music.|$|E
