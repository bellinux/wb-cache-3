This study knits several evolving trends in the area <b>of</b> <b>import</b> sourcing into a theoretical framework in order to facilitate research in this under-researched topic and expose to practitioners the increasing strategic value <b>of</b> <b>import</b> sourcing.

Implications of the principle for practice and research are discussed. While the interest in import sourcing, also called international sourcing in this paper, has grown by leaps and bounds in recent years [Kotabe 1992], the history of research on the topic shows long periods of inactivity. The work of Skinner [1964] and Vernon [1966] nearly thirty years ago, and Fayerweather's [1969] and Moxon's work [1974, 1975] about twenty years ago addressed some of the basic issues surrounding import sourcing but, i...|$|R

The output of this period was prolific in quantity but unequal in quality. Initially the eisteddfod was askance with the religious denominations, but in time these bodies came to dominate the competitions, with the bardic themes becoming increasingly scriptural and didactic. The period is notable for the adoption by Welsh poets of bardic names, made popular by the eisteddfod movement.|$|E

5|$|Pottery {{produced}} locally in East Africa {{was shaped}} by hand, unglazed, and assumed to be open fired, {{but it has been}} proposed that the absence of evidence for kilns {{may be the result of}} mistaking their remnants for metal furnaces. However, the absence of glazed and wheeled pottery illustrates that the inhabitants of the Swahili Coast did not adapt these technologies as a result of Indian Ocean trade, but were primarily the recipients of finished products in exchange for other local produce. Conversely, fifteen different potters' marks have been found at Gedi on pottery found on or near the surface of the site dating to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which has been used to suggest the site may have had a communal kiln at that time. The pots inscribed with the potters marks show the variation of different types and styles of ceramics over time, which were influenced by local production, as well as, the adaption of foreign design elements. Prior to the diversification of local styles and types, early ceramics at Gedi were more uniform and contained similarities with ceramics found at other coastal sites. Despite the increase <b>of</b> <b>imported</b> ceramics in the fifteenth century, local varieties continued to be present in later levels of the sites occupation.|$|E
