50|$|Babefphite is an {{anisotropic}} mineral {{meaning that}} the velocity of light passing though it will {{vary depending on the}} direction of travel. When measured against Canada Balsam it will display moderate positive relief. Relief is an optical property that relates the index of refraction of a mineral versus the index of refraction of another material. Positive relief denotes light being bent toward the mineral. Negative relief means the light is bent toward the mounting material. In the case of optical mineralogy, this other material is most often whatever material is used to mount the mineral in question in thin section. Based on the white color of babefphite in hand sample it is likely that it appears clear in thin section under plane polarized light. Due to its anisotropic nature, it has the possibility of displaying very weak pleochroism under the same conditions. Pleochroism is defined as a change of color, on rotation, of plane light. It occurs when the extraordinary and <b>ordinary</b> <b>rays</b> of light are absorbed differently, thereby displaying different colors. The wider the difference in the rays the more dramatic the color change. Babefphite is also weakly birefringent. Birefringence is an optical property that is determined by the direction that light passes through a mineral.|$|R

For example, no rigorous solution to the diffraction by penetrable wedge and cone is available. In this paper, we suggest a new method, the virtual ray of diffraction(VRD), to construct the diffraction coefficients of a composite wedge composed of perfect conductor and lossless dielectric[1]. The method consists of actual ray-tracing in the physical region and virtual ray-tracing in the complementary region. At first, the ordinary ray-tracing provides the geometrical optics(GO) field. Applying the physical optics(PO) approximation to the corresponding dual integral equations[2], one may obtain the complete form of the PO field consisting of the GO term and the edge-diffracted field[3]. The PO diffraction coefficients are expressed by finite series of cotangent functions, of which amplitudes and poles are equal to the amplitudes and propagation directions of the <b>ordinary</b> <b>rays,</b> respectively. It should be noted that there is one-to-one correspondence between the geometrical rays and the PO diffraction coefficients.

40|$|We {{consider}} the possibility that a large fraction of the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays are decay products of Z bosons which were produced in the scattering of ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos on cosmological relic neutrinos. We compare the observed ultrahigh energy cosmic ray spectrum with the one predicted in the above Z-burst scenario and determine the required mass of the heaviest relic neutrino as well as the necessary ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrino flux via a maximum likelihood analysis. We show that the value of the neutrino mass obtained in this way is fairly robust against variations in presently unknown quantities, like the amount of neutrino clustering, the universal radio background, and the extragalactic magnetic field, within their anticipated uncertainties. Much stronger systematics arises from different possible assumptions about the diffuse background of <b>ordinary</b> cosmic <b>rays</b> from unresolved astrophysical sources.

The birefringence (double refraction of light into polarized or-dinary and extraordinary rays) of liquid crystals (LC) is well known and used extensively to manipulate optical radiation in visible and near-IR light. Recently, we showed that several LCs are relatively transparent (extinction coefficient of 2 cm− 1) and exhibit substantial birefringence magnitude, ∆n≥ 0. 1, in the ter-ahertz (THz) —or sub-millimeter wavelength—region. Thus, it should be feasible to produce new THz photonic elements with LC-enabled functionalities such as phase shifters, modulators, attenuators, and polarizers. To illustrate, we present the principle and performance of an LC-based Lyot filter. It has two phase retarder elements, A and B, separated by a linear polarizer (see Figure 1). Each retarder el-ement consists of a fixed retarder (FR) and a tunable retarder (TR). The FR consists {{of a pair of}} permanent magnets sand-wiching a homogeneously-aligned LC cell (i. e., the LCmolecules align parallel to the substrate). The homogeneous cells in FRA and FRB supply fixed phase retardations, ΓA and ΓB, for THz waves. The tunable retarders, TRA and TRB—see Figure 1 (b) — are homeotropically-aligned LC cells (i. e., LC molecules align perpendicular to the substrate) {{at the center of a}} rotatable mag-net. TRA and TRB are used to achieve the desired variable phase retardation, ∆ΓA and ∆ΓB. Because of the birefringence of LC, the THz waves that pass through each element separate into extraordinary and <b>ordinary</b> <b>rays</b> (e-ray and o-ray) with corresponding time delays between the e-ray and o-ray, ∆τA and ∆τB, respectively.
