40|$|This paper {{compares the}} coping {{strategies}} of two groups <b>of</b> <b>families</b> coping with unusual stresses: <b>families</b> <b>of</b> diabetic adolescents and <b>families</b> <b>of</b> adolescents who were psychiatrically hospitalized in early adolescence.

The coping <b>of</b> the <b>families</b> <b>of</b> adolescents with a history of psychiatric illness was characterized by greater family passivity and less confidence in family problem-solving ability. The coping <b>of</b> <b>families</b> with diabetic adolescents was characterized by greater reliance on active internal and external means of responding to stress, such as reframing family problems, using church and religious resources, and seeking support from extended <b>family.</b> Implications <b>of</b> these results are discussed {{in the context of the}} particular stresses with which these special families cope...|$|R
