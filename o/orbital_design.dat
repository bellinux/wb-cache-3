5000|$|The {{constellation}} {{consists of}} 66 active satellites in orbit required for global coverage, and additional spare satellites {{to serve in}} case of failure. Satellites are in low Earth orbit at a height of approximately 485 mi and inclination of 86.4°. Orbital velocity of the satellites is approximately 17000 mph. Satellites communicate with neighboring satellites via [...] inter-satellite links. Each satellite can have four inter-satellite links: one each to neighbors fore and aft in the same orbital plane, and one each to satellites in neighboring planes to either side. The satellites orbit from pole to same pole with an orbital period of roughly 100 minutes. This design {{means that there is}} excellent satellite visibility and service coverage even at the North and South poles. The over-the-pole <b>orbital</b> <b>design</b> produces [...] "seams" [...] where satellites in counter-rotating planes next to one another are traveling in opposite directions. Cross-seam inter-satellite link hand-offs would have to happen very rapidly and cope with large Doppler shifts; therefore, Iridium supports inter-satellite links only between satellites orbiting in the same direction. The constellation of 66 active satellites has six orbital planes spaced 30 degrees apart, with 11 satellites in each plane (not counting spares). The original concept was to have 77 satellites, which is where the name Iridium came from, being the element with the atomic number 77 and the satellites evoking the Bohr model image of electrons orbiting around the Earth as its nucleus. This reduced set of six planes is sufficient to cover the entire Earth's surface at every moment.|$|E

40|$|Uncertainties in the {{dynamical}} system {{affect all}} real-life applications in astrodynamics. This {{is particularly true}} for satellites orbiting about small bodies owing to their irregular shapes and to the difficulties in characterizing their physical properties at {{the early stages of}} a dedicated spacecraft mission. Hence, accommodating uncertainty in the <b>orbital</b> <b>design</b> process may be extremely beneficial for the success of the mission. Here, in a Lyapunov stability perspective, the properties of the invariant manifolds are exploited to generate regions of the phase space where the motion is guaranteed to evolve despite the uncertainties in the system parameters and navigation errors. Specifically, the scenario approach is applied to tackle a semi-infinite optimization problem that locates these robust regions. The methodology is illustrated with the robust design of a inner retrograde orbit about the primary of (65803) Didymos as well as with a ballistic landing on the smaller secondary body...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Tether {{transportation}} system can form the infrastructure for a reusable low cost space transportation architecture {{and can be}} used to carry frequent traffic between orbits. The Tether transportation facility would be sized for launch on a single large rocket vehicle to its operational orbit.

Using comparison for differing payload capacities of each vehicle and the dependence of launch pricing upon business factors, these research indicates that a reusable tether boost facility could enable commercial customers to reduce their launch costs by reduction of recurring costs...|$|E

40|$|It {{is highly}} {{desirable}} to combine {{recent advances in}} the topological quantum phases with technologically relevant materials. Chromium dioxide (CrO 2) is a half-metallic material, widely used in high-end data storage applications. Using first principles calculations, we show via interfacial <b>orbital</b> <b>design</b> that a novel class of half semi-metallic Dirac electronic phase emerges at the interface CrO 2 with TiO 2 in both thin film and superlattice configurations, with four spin-polarized Dirac points in momentum-space (k-space) band structure. When the spin and orbital degrees of freedom are allowed to couple, the CrO 2 /TiO 2 superlattice becomes a Chern insulator without external fields or additional doping. With topological gaps equivalent to 43 Kelvin and a Chern number 2, the ensuing quantization of Hall conductance to 2 e^ 2 /h will enable potential development of these highly industrialized oxides for applications in topologically high fidelity data storage and energy-efficient electronic and spintronic devices.

40|$|We {{carried out}} a {{computerised}} tomographic (CT) examination to elucidate the modifications in the head related to orbital enlargement in the Baikal seal. Transverse CT images showed that (1) the external frontal contours and the frontal sinuses are compressed medially and ventrally by the orbital enlargement; (2) the caudal part of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx are compacted ventrally; and (3) the cranial cavity is displaced caudally. The neurocranium is obviously separated from the facial part in the transverse plane at the caudal region of the orbit. The disposition of the mandible, zygomatic arch, temporal bone, and the masseter, temporal, digastric and pterygoid muscles is changed by the enlarged orbit in the 3 -dimensional reorganisation of the head in this species. It is suggested that adaptation for the Lake Baikal environment primarily resulted in orbital enlargement, and that the altered <b>orbital</b> <b>design</b> may subsequently have influenced the form and function of the masticatory and respiratory system...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the <b>orbital</b> <b>design</b> for ACESat {{and the trade}} between instrument stability and continuous access to the star. Three different trajectories are considered for this analysis: Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO) and Heliocentric. Uninterrupted stare time to Alpha Centauri is crucial for meeting science requirements; any given orbit requires a 90 % minimum access. The instrument thermal stability also has stringent requirements for proper function, influencing trajectory design. However, the driving requirement for mission success centers on the pointing stability of the instrument, with a less than 10 arc second maximum deflection. While other factors come into play, the primary {{focus is on the}} reliability and accuracy in acquiring Alpha Centauri within the instrument aperture. Therefore the desired orbit has minimal eclipse durations and should orientate the spacecraft in the sky were there are no interruptions from the instrument to the star system.

40|$|The human {{exploration}} of Phobos and Deimos or the retrieval of a surface sample launched to low-Mars orbit presents a highly constrained orbital transfer problem. In general, {{the plane of}} the target orbit will not be accessible from the arrival or departure interplanetary trajectories with an (energetically optimal) tangential burn at periapsis. The <b>orbital</b> <b>design</b> is further complicated by the addition of a high-energy parking orbit for the relatively massive Deep Space Vehicle to reduce propellant expenditure, while the crew transfers to and from the target orbit in a smaller Space Exploration Vehicle. The proposed strategy shifts the arrival and departure maneuvers away from periapsis so that the apsidal line of the parking orbit lies in {{the plane of the}} target orbit, permitting highly efficient plane change maneuvers at apoapsis of the elliptical parking orbit. An apsidal shift during the arrival or departure maneuver is approximately five times as efficient as maneuvering while in Mars orbit, thus significantly reducing the propellant necessary to transfer between the arrival, target, and departure orbits...|$|E

40|$|The Mission to Planet Earth {{initiative}} {{will require}} global observation of land, sea, and atmosphere, and all associated phenomena {{over the coming}} years; perhaps for decades. A major phenomenon playing a major part in earth's environment is volcanic activity. Orbital observations, including IR, UV, and visible imaging, may be made to monitor many active sites, and eventually increase our understanding of volcanoes and lead to the predictability of eruptions. This paper presents the <b>orbital</b> <b>design</b> and maneuvering capability of a low cost, volcano observing satellite, flying in low earth orbit. Major science requirements include observing as many as 10 to 20 active sites daily, or {{every two or three}} days. Given specific geographic locations of these sites, it is necessary to search the trajectory space for those orbits which maximize overflight opportunities. Also, once the satellite is in orbit, it may be desirable to alter the orbit to fly over targets of opportunity.
