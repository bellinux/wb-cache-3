5|$|A notable {{cultural}} {{trait of}} Chiprovtsi shared {{with much of}} the region is the veneration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> patron saint, named svetets ("saint") and akin to Serbian slava.

The svetets is associated to the family house: when a daughter-in-law comes to live there, she accepts the family saint of the home, and when a family member or a foreign settler moves out or builds a new house, they adopt a new svetets.|$|E

Baldwin was not a member or close associate of the Glanvill faction, so most likely he was sent ahead to look after the king's interests, whatever the reasons for the inclusion of his companions.
