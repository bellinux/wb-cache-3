25|$|The natural predators {{of adult}} greater rheas {{are limited to}} the cougar (Puma concolor), which are found in most areas {{inhabited}} by greater rheas and are certain to be their leading predator, and the jaguar (Panthera onca), which are found with greater rheas and opportunistically hunt them in the Paraguayan chaco, central Bolivia and the Brazilian cerrado. Feral dogs are known to kill younger birds, and the southern caracara (Caracara plancus) is suspected to prey on hatchlings. Armadillos sometimes feed on greater rhea eggs; nests have been found which had been undermined by a six-banded armadillo (Euphractus sexcinctus) <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> hairy armadillo (Chaetophractus villosus) and the rhea eggs were broken apart. Predation on young rheas has also been reportedly committed by greater grisons (Galictis vittata).|$|E

2500|$|On 28 June, the Fourth Army {{headquarters}} instructed {{that should}} the initial attacks cause the German defence to collapse, the closest infantry would exploit {{without waiting for}} cavalry; furthermore, the 19th (Western) and 49th (West Riding) division (in local reserve) would be committed along the Albert–Bapaume road and parallel to it to the north.
