5000|$|While {{some critics}} gave the record a more lukewarm reception, even {{they could not}} hold back completely. Bettie Lou Vegas at Ink19 listened to the record and wrote: [...] "Seven Storey is {{something}} I would have played into the ground in 1993.

In his review, he wrote that [...] "The album definitely has strong points with tracks like 'Unknown Satellite' and 'Dress Rehearsal,' but the majority {{of the rest of the}} album only displays the band's potential. Give this band 5 more years with this new lineup and I bet they'll be able to do something amazing.

5000|$|Khan {{is perhaps}} best known for his innovation, Jafferkhani Baaj. He {{describes}} it as, [...] "a synthesis of precision in technique, systematic thought" [...] with a vigorous playing style. Cultural anthropologist and reader at the University of Mumbai, Dr. Kamala Ganesh states: [...] "His music making is full of eclectic yet deeply informed choices. He is a thinking musician but puts across his complex views with a simplicity and feeling which demarcate the articulate performer from the articulate theoretician.... In him, one gets an unmistakable sense... a syncretic tradition". The Indian santoor player Shivkumar Sharma remembers of Khan's performance of the raga Chaayanat: [...] "It was probably in 1955-56, I was relaxing in my terrace in Jammu. In the stillness of the night I heard the notes of Raga Chaayanat on the sitar emanate from <b>my</b> neighbor's <b>radio.</b> I immediately noticed that the tone of the sitar was completely different and the style of playing radically unique. I rushed to switch <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>radio....</b> I was totally engrossed and was very curious to know who this maestro was." ...|$|R

In an {{interview}} for STV, Blunt claimed: [...] "After the last tour I tried writing at the piano, but I was repeating myself, writing sad songs about poor old me. I needed {{to get away from}} music for a while. My new songs, most prominently 'Stay the Night', are more optimistic. One thing I did learn is that your artistic credibility goes out the window when you have a big record. 'You're Beautiful' meant something to me, but to most people, it's a song they sing when they're drunk." [...] The lyrics in [...] "Stay the Night" [...] feature a reference to Bob Marley's classic [...] "Is This Love" [...] in the lines: Just like the song <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>radio</b> said / We’ll share the shelter of my single bed. Marley is credited as a co-writer. The version released on the U.S. edition of the album is different than the original; it features a fade-in intro and runs for a length of 3 minutes and 25 seconds.|$|R

She said that the show [...] "is making me listen to 2fm again" [...] and that [...] "and King's chemistry is fantastic, their references and asides are brilliant and their indignant outsiderness is hilarious".

40|$|This {{creative}} project combines {{several key}} elements that current successful <b>radio</b> stations and <b>shows</b> undergo {{to maximize their}} profits, increase listeners, and build a strong fan base: on-air work, promotions, sales, and web design. Major radio stations have many employees who diverge their effort into running each specific department. Station disc jockeys focus on the on-air responsibilities; marketing or promotional directors manage all promotional events and branding opportunities; account executives and managers are responsible for all advertising avenues; and webmasters are given the job of keeping an up-to-date and exciting website. Having had background in all four areas through work and school at Ball State, I decided to expand <b>my</b> current <b>radio</b> <b>show</b> duties <b>on</b> college radio WCRD 91. 3 FM to include more on-air preparation, undergo a promotional campaign on the Ball State campus, sell show and segment sponsorship, and design and maintain a professional show website. The following portfolio {{is a collection of}} my work in each area. The on-air portion includes program schedules, audio segments, and show highlights. The promotional part features all of the flyers that were used in the campaign, pictures of Adam Adler Show t-shirts, and static stickers. Sales includes the sales materials used in my presentations and signed contracts from my three sponsors. The web area has several pages from the website and emails and guest book signings from show listeners.

40|$|As host of The Space <b>Show,</b> <b>my</b> <b>radio</b> talk <b>show</b> {{focusing}} <b>on</b> expanding space commerce, space tourism, and Mars exploration, I frequently receive {{questions and}} queries from the program’s listeners. The overriding {{theme of this}} listener feedback strongly suggests that {{a significant part of}} the population does not understand the need for a space program that facilitates the development of space resources, space tourism, a human Mars mission, or even acknowledges the benefits derived from a successful space program. Clearly, space advocates, specific space program proponents, and even NASA do not successfully articulate the case for space development to a wide segment of our population. This paper addresses the feedback received from listeners since starting The Space Show (formerly Business Without Boundaries) in June 2001. In addressing the issues raised by the listening audience, recommendations are offered for how best to both talk with and inform the general public about the importance of having an expanded space program, including a new off-Earth economy resulting from a much expanded commercial space industry. Developing a space economy and space resources requires widespread public support and constructive policymaking. Obtaining this support and enabling the creation of constructive space policies may largely depend on those in the space community doing a better job in helping the public to understand the benefits of space development. The recommendations contained in this paper can serve as a useful and productive guide to winning public support as well as influencing policy makers for the benefit of off-Earth commerce and opportunities...|$|R
