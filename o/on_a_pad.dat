500|$|Voters {{cast their}} ballots on November 3, and that evening {{gathered}} in cities and around telegraph offices. In places like New York, the results were projected by stereopticon onto the sides of newspaper buildings. The election was {{considered by many to}} be the most crucial since 1860, and large numbers of voters followed the returns all night. McKinley cast his ballot early, going with his brother Abner to the polling place, and met Hanna for lunch. That evening, McKinley sat in his library as the returns came in by telegraph. It was quickly apparent that McKinley was leading, and by midnight he had pencilled the figure [...] "241" [...] <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pad,</b> the number of electoral votes of states that were certain, enough for victory. Hanna wired from Cleveland to Canton, [...] "The feeling here beggars description ... I will not attempt bulletins. [...] You are elected to the highest office of the land by a people who always loved and trusted you." ...|$|E
2500|$|The note demanded $118,000, {{the rounded}} amount of John Ramsey's bonus that year. Fitzgerald {{said that the}} note was not written by a {{kidnapper}} or a [...] "real criminal", but someone who had written the note <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> of paper used by Patsy Ramsey in their home. The note was unusually long, most ransom notes are 50 to 60 words. It took the experts 21 minutes or more to copy the ransom note and it noted {{that it would take}} more time to think about what to write. The pen and paper were not left out, but returned to their rightful place by the note's author. Many lines from the letter were taken from Speed, [...] Dirty Harry and other films.|$|E
2500|$|Bolland now {{draws on}} a computer, eschewing pencil and paper. He cites the {{influence}} of Dave Gibbons, who [...] "had got into computers himself, and... was really enthusing about them." [...] Noting also that some colorists were increasingly using computer effects [...] "seemingly arbitrarily," [...] he decided [...] "that if I didn't {{take control of the}} colouring process myself... would eventually transform the covers into something not my own." [...] Starting in 1997, Bolland [...] "bought all the gear" [...] and spent ten frustrated months learning the ropes and ultimately finding the liberating [...] "infinite ability to change" [...] his now-solely-onscreen artwork. He states categorically that, in his opinion, [...] "here is absolutely no difference between drawing on my Wacom tablet and drawing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> of paper." [...] Having fully embraced the technology, Bolland has also produced a number of [...] on his [...] demonstrating his complex techniques. He states that, while this leap means that he no longer produces any paper-based artwork (a profitable sideline for many artists who sell on their original work to collectors), [...] "the pen and paper are gone for good." ...|$|E
50|$|Color and {{reflectivity}} have {{no impact}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pad's</b> insulating ability. Just like with clothing and sleeping bags, the interior color (flat black, shiny silver, white, or orange) {{makes no difference}} in warmth.|$|R

He was the son of the famous Serbian architect Danilo Vladisavljević (1871 – 1923) who had studied architecture in Munich and Aachen and later taught at the Belgrade University...|$|R

6000|$|At {{my request}} he then wrote his name <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> while Miller waited and listened, his mind {{too busy with}} surmise to permit of speech.

60|$|The faro-dealer slipped two cards. The high card won. He {{scribbled}} {{the amount}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pad,</b> and the weigher {{at the bar}} balanced fifty dollars' worth of dust in the gold-scales and poured it into Burning Daylight's sack. The waltz {{in the back room}} being finished, the three couples, followed by the fiddler and the pianist and heading for the bar, caught Daylight's eye.|$|E

50|$|Wrestling is {{conducted}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>padded</b> mat {{that must have}} excellent shock absorption, tear resistance, and compression qualities. Most mats are made of PVC rubber nitrile foam. Recent advances in technology have brought about new mats made using closed cell, cross-linked polyethylene foam covered in vinyl backed with non-woven polyester.|$|R
50|$|Complete suits {{of armor}} survive {{only from the}} latter part of the schynbald era. In fifteenth century gothic armour they were {{strapped}} not to mail but to fastenings <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>padded</b> undergarment. By the early fifteenth century greaves had supplanted schynbalds in white armour. Schynbalds were essentially obsolete by the sixteenth century.|$|R
60|$|Janet obeyed, {{and when}} she {{returned}} Ditmar was making notes with a pencil <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pad.</b> The conversation with Holter {{had given her a}} new idea of Ditmar's daring in attempting to fill the Bradlaugh order with the Chippering Mills alone, had aroused in her more strongly than ever that hot loyalty to the mills with which he had inspired her; and that strange surge of sympathy, of fellow-feeling for the operatives she had experienced after the interview with Mr. Siddons, of rebellion against him, the conviction that she also was one of the slaves he exploited, had wholly disappeared. Ditmar was the Chippering Mills, and she, somehow, enlisted once again on his side.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not attempt}} to define this word fact. Fact expresses for me {{something}} in its nature primary and unanalyzable. I start from that. I take as a typical statement of fact that I sit here at my desk writing with a fountain pen <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> of ruled scribbling paper, that the sunlight falls upon me and throws the shadow of my window mullion across the page, that Peter, my cat, sleeps on the window-seat close at hand and that this agate paper-weight with the silver top that once was Henley's holds my loose memoranda together. Outside is a patch of lawn and then a fringe of winter-bitten iris leaves and then the sea, greatly wrinkled and astir under the south-west wind. There is a boat going out which I think may be Jim Pain's, but of that I cannot be sure...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{the thing}} that you have got to be most {{particular}} about, Tom. If the saddle does not sit right the horse gets galled, and when a horse once gets galled he ain't of much use till he is well again, though the Indians ride them when they are in a terrible state; but then they have got so many horses that, unless they are specially good, they don't hold them of any account. You see the saddle is so high that there is good space between it and the backbone, and the pressure comes fair on the ribs, so the ponies don't get galled if the blankets are folded properly. The Indians do not use saddles, but ride either <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> or just a folded blanket, and their ponies are always getting galled." ...|$|E

One of them is sitting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>padded</b> armchair, while {{the other one is}} standing beside her, embracing her. The girls' last name is noted beneath the photograph.

60|$|Saddle-bags are so {{troublesome}} to open, {{and require}} so many straps, that I {{believe it is}} best to use a bag of macintosh or canvas, rolled up and tied behind the saddle, where it should rest <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pad.</b> The pad is made of two cushions, each 9 inches long and 4 broad, sewn on a piece of leather, lying parallel to one another, and 4 inches apart. The space between the cushions corresponds to the backbone of the horse. To keep the whole in shape, it is usual to stitch four or five laths of wood lengthways to the upper surface of the pad; upon these laths the bag will rest. If there be occasion to carry a bag on horseback for a short distance, pass one of the stirrup-leathers through its string; then throw the bag {{over to the other side}} of the saddle: it will lie behind the rider's leg, and be out of his way and he will sit upon part of its string.|$|E

5000|$|David Joyce {{received}} a US$15,000 commission in 1988 for an installation of his artwork {{as part of}} the remodeling of the airport. He posed his volunteer subjects in flying position <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>padded</b> mat, and photographed them with a 35 mm camera while he was standing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> ladder. He then used mural paper to create prints that were approximately two-thirds life-size.|$|R

50|$|The {{coil springs}} usually bear <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> {{alongside}} the stub-axle. Often the shock is colinear with the spring, {{to form a}} coilover. This location gives them a very high motion ratio compared with most suspensions, which improves their performance, and reduces their weight.|$|E
