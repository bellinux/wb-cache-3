40|$|International audienceThe {{corrosion}} <b>of</b> <b>steels</b> {{has long}} been the topic for materials scientists. It is established that surface treatment is an efficient way to improve the corrosion resistance <b>of</b> <b>steels</b> without changing the bulk properties and with low costs. In the present paper, different kinds of surface treatment techniques for steels are briefly reviewed. In particular, the surface modification involving nanostructure formations <b>of</b> <b>steels</b> by using a low energy high pulsed electron beam (LEHCPEB) treatment is lightened {{in the case of an}} AISI 316 L stainless steel and D 2 steel. The overall results demonstrate the high potential of the LEHCPEB technique for improving the corrosion performance <b>of</b> <b>steels...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the amplitude of magnetoacoustic emission and the residual magnetic induction of the materials is shown. The dependence of magnetoacoustic emission (MAE) on the frequency of magnetization reversal of a group <b>of</b> <b>steels</b> <b>of</b> different chemical composition was investigated.

The magnetic properties of two groups <b>of</b> <b>steels</b> subjected to various thermal treatments have been studied.

30|$|Mathematical {{expression}} describing plastic behavior <b>of</b> <b>steels</b> {{allows the}} execution of parametric studies for many purposes. Various formulas {{have been developed to}} characterize stress strain curves <b>of</b> <b>steels.</b> However, most <b>of</b> those formulas failed to describe accurately the strain hardening behavior <b>of</b> <b>steels</b> in the full range which shows various distinct stages. For this purpose, a new formula is developed based on the well-known Ramberg–Osgood formula to describe the full range strain hardening behavior <b>of</b> <b>steels.</b> Test results <b>of</b> all the six types <b>of</b> <b>steels</b> show a three-stage strain hardening behavior. The proposed formula can describe such behavior accurately in the full range using a single expression. The parameters of the formula can be obtained directly and easily through linear regression analysis. Excellent agreements with the test data are observed for all the steels tested. Furthermore, other formulas such as Ludwigson formula, Gardner formula, UGent formula are also applied for comparison. Finally, the proposed formula is considered to have wide suitability and high accuracy for all the steels tested.|$|R

5|$|The {{carbon content}} <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> is between 0.002% and 2.14% by weight for plain ironcarbon alloys. These values vary {{depending}} on alloying elements such as manganese, chromium, nickel, iron, tungsten, carbon and so on. Basically, steel is an iron-carbon alloy that does not undergo eutectic reaction. In contrast, cast iron does undergo eutectic reaction. Too little carbon content leaves (pure) iron quite soft, ductile, and weak. Carbon contents higher than those <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> make an alloy, commonly called pig iron, that is brittle (not malleable). While iron alloyed with carbon is called carbon steel, alloy steel is steel to which other alloying elements have been intentionally added to modify the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>steel.</b> Common alloying elements include: manganese, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, boron, titanium, vanadium, tungsten, cobalt, and niobium. Additional elements are also important in steel: phosphorus, sulfur, silicon, and traces of oxygen, nitrogen, and copper, that are most frequently considered undesirable.|$|E
