25|$|Following the 2011 Fukushima I nuclear {{accidents}} Chris Huhne, Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, {{wrote to}} Dr Mike Weightman, {{head of the}} HSE's Nuclear Directorate, on March 12, asking for a report 'on {{the implications of the}} situation and the lessons to be learned for the UK nuclear industry. The report is to be delivered within 6 months, with an interim report by mid-May, 'prepared in close cooperation with the International nuclear community and other nuclear safety regulators'. On March 15, Huhne expressed regret that some European politicians were 'rushing to judgement' before assessments had been carried <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that it was too early to determine whether the willingness of the private sector to invest in new nuclear plants would be affected. In the wake of the accident the Government was criticised for having colluded with EDF Energy, Areva and Westinghouse in order to manage communications and maintain public support for nuclear power.|$|E
25|$|There {{was now a}} tumult arisen at Alexandria, {{between the}} Jewish {{inhabitants}} and the Greeks; and three ambassadors were chosen out of each party that were at variance, who came to Gaius. Now one of these ambassadors from the people of Alexandria was Apion, (29) who uttered many blasphemies against the Jews; and, among other things that he said, he charged them with neglecting the honors that belonged to Caesar; for that while all who were subject to the Roman empire built altars and temples to Gaius, and in other regards universally received him as they received the gods, these Jews alone thought it a dishonorable thing for them to erect statues in honor of him, {{as well as to}} swear by his name. Many of these severe things were said by Apion, by which he hoped to provoke Gaius to anger at the Jews, as he was likely to be. But Philo, the principal of the Jewish embassage, a man eminent on all accounts, brother to Alexander the Alabarch, (30) and one not unskillful in philosophy, was ready to betake himself to make his defense against those accusations; but Gaius prohibited him, and bid him begone; he was also in such a rage, that it openly appeared he was about to do them some very great mischief. So Philo being thus affronted, went <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> to those Jews who were about him, that they should be of good courage, since Gaius's words indeed showed anger at them, but in reality had already set God against himself.|$|E
25|$|The main feud {{heading into}} No Mercy was between World Heavyweight Champion King Booker, Bobby Lashley, Batista, and Finlay. At SummerSlam, the {{pay-per-view}} {{two months before}} No Mercy, Batista defeated King Booker by disqualification after Queen Sharmell interfered, meaning Booker retained the World Heavyweight Title. The next week on SmackDown!, Batista and Lashley faced King Booker's Court (Booker, Finlay, and William Regal) in a three-on-two handicap match. Booker's Court controlled most of the match, isolating Batista and Lashley from each other. Towards {{the end of the}} match, Lashley tagged in Batista, who pinned Booker for the win after a Spinebuster. Two weeks later on the September 8 edition of SmackDown!, Batista faced Booker for the World Heavyweight Championship, which Booker won after Finlay interfered and hit Batista with a shillelagh. After the match, Finlay continued to attack Batista with the shillelagh and a steel chair. The next week on SmackDown!, Finlay began degrading Batista, saying he is probably hiding in a hole licking his wounds. As Finlay was about to continue, Lashley came <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that only someone like him would jump Batista from behind. SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long then scheduled Finlay to wrestle Lashley later that night to determine the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship at No Mercy. Lashley defeated Finlay and became number one contender after Finlay was disqualified for hitting him with a shillelagh. On the September 22 episode of SmackDown!, Lashley teamed up with Batista to take on Finlay and Regal. Midway through the match, Batista and Finlay brawled outside the ring and into the crowd, leaving Regal on his own against Lashley. Lashley gained the pinfall after hitting Regal with a Spear. Later that night Batista was scheduked to wrestle Finlay at No Mercy. Two weeks later on the October 6 episode of SmackDown!, Booker faced off against Finlay and Batista faced off against Lashley, with both matches ending in a no-contest. This lead Theodore Long to schedule a Fatal Four-Way match between the four at No Mercy.|$|E

25|$|The {{other main}} match {{on the card}} was Randy Orton versus Rey Mysterio for Mysterio's world {{championship}} match at WrestleMania 22. Their match stemmed from the Royal Rumble, the pay-per-view three weeks before No Way Out. At the Royal Rumble, Mysterio won the 2006 Royal Rumble match and a world championship match at WrestleMania 22 by last eliminating Randy Orton. On the February 3 episode of SmackDown!, Orton claimed that there's {{no way he could}} beat him in a normal match and that he won the match because of some divine intervention. Orton then challenged Mysterio to a match at No Way Out for his title match at WrestleMania 22, and claimed that Eddie Guerrero was not in heaven, but in hell. Later that night, Orton along with Mark Henry defeated Mysterio and Kurt Angle. Midway through the match, Davari confronted Angle and was chased outside the ring and into the crowd. Henry followed, leaving Mysterio and Orton on their own. Orton gained the pinfall after sitting on Mysterio. After the match, Orton claimed that Mysterio had as much chance of defeating him as Guerrero did of coming back to life. Mysterio responded by accepting Orton's challenge on behalf of Guerrero. The next week on SmackDown!, Orton set the record straight about the comments he made about Eddie Guerrero. Backstage, he said that he only made the comments to get inside Mysterio's head, and {{that he did not know}} or care if Guerrero was in Hell. Orton later entered the arena in a lowrider to further explain his actions, and read an excerpt from Guerrero's book, Cheating Death, Stealing Life – The Eddie Guerrero Story, but Mysterio attacked him, dropkicking his head into the steel ringpost. On the February 17 episode of SmackDown!, Mysterio faced off against Sylvan, which Mysterio won after a West Coast Pop. After the match, Orton came <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that Mysterio would never main event WrestleMania, he would never become World Champion and that he could never beat him.|$|E
500|$|A {{story in}} the Cowboy-friendly newspaper, the Nugget, stated without {{attribution}} that [...] "The Sheriff stepped <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> : 'Hold up boys, don't go down there or there will be trouble; I have been down there to disarm them.'" [...] In his testimony, Behan repeatedly insisted he told the Earps that he only intended to disarm the Cowboys, not that he had actually done so. The article said that Behan [...] "was standing near by commanding the contestants to cease firing but was powerless to prevent it." [...] Given the Nugget close relationship to Behan (it was owned by Behan's deputy sheriff), it is likely they interviewed him. By Williams' account, Behan told Virgil Earp immediately after the gunfight a story that corroborated the Nugget report, which the newspaper altered afterward to a version that matched the story Behan later told at the coroner's inquest.|$|E
500|$|Connie Smith's {{sound is}} defined by the Nashville Sound musical style, {{primarily}} during her breakthrough years in the 1960s. While most Nashville Sound recordings of the time mainly included full orchestras, Smith's sound remained more traditional with its use of steel guitar and her twangy vocals, while still featuring some pop-influenced instrumentation to provide urban pop appeal. Critics have largely praised Smith's use of the steel guitar, which have often been described as [...] "sharp" [...] and [...] "prominent". Smith's steel guitar player Weldon Myrick is often credited with creating what Smith has called [...] "The Connie Smith Sound". In an interview with Colin Escott in his book Born to Sing, Myrick recalls how Smith's producer (Bob Ferguson) wanted the guitar to sound, [...] "He came <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> he wanted a bright sound, and he adjusted my controls.

Steve Kandell of New York magazine called April and Andy perhaps the [...] "most convincingly matched and resoundingly sympathetic couple in sitcom history", and said their storylines have been handled much more effectively than those of Jim Halpert and Pam Beesly in the NBC comedy The Office. Kandell was more critical of the Ann character, and said she did not seem to fit {{as a part of the}} show anymore. Some reviews were less positive. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said there were individual elements of the episode she enjoyed, but felt the wedding happened too quickly and the lack of buildup reduced the tension leading up to the event. Joel Keller of TV Squad said, [...] "In a mostly stellar season, this one sits near the bottom of the list." [...] Keller said the wedding ruined an otherwise funny episode, and that it felt ineffective and rushed because April and Andy were fighting with each other only four episodes earlier.

500|$|The session, {{held the}} evening of July 5, 1954, proved entirely unfruitful {{until late in the}} night.

Three days later, popular Memphis DJ Dewey Phillips played [...] "That's All Right" [...] on his WHBQ Red, Hot, and Blue show. Listeners began phoning in, eager to find out who the singer was. The interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the last two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended in order to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed he was black. During the next few days, the trio recorded a bluegrass number, Bill Monroe's [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky", again in a distinctive style and employing an audio delay echo effect that Sam Phillips dubbed [...] "slapback".
