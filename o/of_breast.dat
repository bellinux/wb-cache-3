5|$|The {{effect on}} sexual desire is varied, with {{increase}} or decrease in some but with no effect in most. Combined oral contraceptives {{reduce the risk of}} ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer and do not change the risk <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer. They often reduce menstrual bleeding and painful menstruation cramps. The lower doses of estrogen released from the vaginal ring may reduce the risk <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> tenderness, nausea, and headache associated with higher dose estrogen products.|$|E
5|$|A 2015 {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis of prospective studies found insufficient {{evidence to support}} an association between induced or spontaneous abortion and an increased risk <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer.|$|E

Procedures are generally followed during breast reconstruction to preserve a natural cleavage <b>of</b> <b>breasts.</b>|$|R

5|$|A 2004 {{analysis}} of data from 53 studies involving 83,000 women with breast cancer reported no increased risk among women who had had either an induced or spontaneous abortion. The relative risk <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer for women who had a spontaneous abortion in this analysis was 0.98, and that for induced abortion was 0.93.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{for breast}} or skin cancer may cause scar tissue to form around the {{treatment}} area. In the case <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> brachytherapy, fat necrosis may {{occur as a}} result of fatty acids entering the breast tissues. This can cause the breast tissue to become swollen and tender. Fat necrosis is a benign condition and typically occurs 4–12 months after treatment and affects about 2% of patients.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Russos' studies found similar risk rates between virgin and {{pregnancy}} interrupted rats, their research would be used to support the contention that abortion created a greater risk <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer for the next twenty years. However, because rats do not exhibit naturally occurring breast cancer, the extrapolation of these results to human abortion and breast cancer is viewed as dubious.|$|E

5|$|In early pregnancy, {{levels of}} estrogen, progesterone, {{estradiol}} increase, leading to breast growth {{in preparation for}} lactation. It has been hypothesized that if this process is interrupted by an abortionbefore full maturity (differentiation) in the third trimesterthen more immature cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy. These immature cells could then be exposed to carcinogens and hormones over time, resulting in a greater potential risk <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer. This mechanism was first proposed and explored in rat studies conducted in the 1980s.|$|E
40|$|Our aim was {{to assess}} the {{feasibility}} and accuracy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> with SonoVue microbubbles for pre-operative size measurement <b>of</b> invasive <b>breast</b> carcinomas. Seven patients diagnosed with nine invasive breast carcinomas prospectively underwent gray-scale ultrasound and CEUS <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> according to a standardized protocol. CEUS <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> was performed by a Philips iU 22 scanner equipped with a 4 – 8 [*]MHz linear array transducer. We used a single dose of 2. 4 [*]ml SonoVue as contrast agent. Breast lesion morphology was scored according to the sonographic BI-RADS lexicon criteria and classified accordingly. The greatest tumor dimensions on gray-scale ultrasound and CEUS <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> were finally compared with the greatest histopathologic tumor sizes. Gray-scale ultrasound underestimated the histopathologic tumor size in 6 / 9 cases (67 %), whereas CEUS <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> underestimated tumor size in only 3 / 9 (33 %) cases. CEUS <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> was significantly more accurate for tumor size assessment. Greatest tumor dimension as measured with gray-scale ultrasound <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> was within 2 [*]mm of the pathologic tumor size in only 2 / 9 cases (22 %), whereas CEUS <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> accurately assessed tumor size within 2 [*]mm of pathologic tumor size in 6 / 9 (67 %) of the cases (P< 0. 05). CEUS <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> proved to be a feasible and safe procedure. It is more accurate than gray-scale ultrasound <b>of</b> the <b>breast</b> for pre-operative size assessment <b>of</b> invasive ductal <b>breast</b> carcinomas...|$|R

5|$|Lack of {{differentiation}} between homosexual and heterosexual women in medical studies that concentrate on health issues for women skews results for lesbians and non-lesbian women. Reports are inconclusive about occurrence <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer in lesbians. It has been determined, however, {{that the lower}} rate of lesbians tested by regular Pap smears {{makes it more difficult}} to detect cervical cancer at early stages in lesbians. The risk factors for developing ovarian cancer rates are higher in lesbians than heterosexual women, perhaps because many lesbians lack protective factors of pregnancy, abortion, contraceptives, breast feeding, and miscarriages.|$|E
