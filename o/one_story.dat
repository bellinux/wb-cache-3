5|$|In {{exploring}} {{the similarities between}} Sjair Abdoel Moeloek and Siti Akbari, Zaini-Lajoubert notes that {{the names of the}} individual kingdoms, save Barham (Barbam in Siti Akbari), are taken directly from the earlier work. Names of characters, such as Abdul Muluk (in Siti Akbari, Abdul Moelan) and Siti Rapiah (Siti Akbari), are simply replaced, although some minor characters are present in <b>one</b> <b>story</b> and not the other. The main plot elements in both stories are the same; some elements, such as the birth and childhood of Abdul Muluk and the later adventures of Siti Rapiah's son, are present in <b>one</b> <b>story</b> and not the other– or given more detail. The two differ greatly in their styles, especially Lie's emphasis on description and realism.|$|E

5|$|The {{tower is}} {{designed}} {{in the form of}} a Doric column. It is divided into four stories with a spiral stairway, and topped by a gallery carrying the lantern. The keeper's cottages are three <b>one</b> <b>story</b> cottages, sharing a roof. Other structures which still stand at the location are a circa 1930 privy and workshop built in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Whatever its origin, {{the giant}} {{has become an}} {{important}} part of the culture and folklore of Dorset. Some folk stories indicate that the image is an outline of the corpse of a real giant. <b>One</b> <b>story</b> says the giant came from Denmark leading an invasion of the coast, and was beheaded by the people of Cerne Abbas while he slept on the hillside.|$|E
5|$|A belief {{from the}} Leskovac region states the ala is a monster with an {{enormous}} mouth who holds in her hand a big wooden spoon, with which she grabs and devours everything that gets in her way. <b>One</b> <b>story</b> has it that a man kept such an ala in his barn; she drank thirty liters of milk every day.

5|$|After Cnut's {{death in}} 1035 the English throne fell to Harold Harefoot, his son {{by his first}} wife, while Harthacnut, his son by Emma, became king in Denmark. England {{remained}} unstable. Alfred returned to England in 1036 to visit his mother and perhaps to challenge Harold as king. <b>One</b> <b>story</b> implicates Earl Godwin of Wessex in Alfred's subsequent death, but others blame Harold. Emma went into exile in Flanders until Harthacnut became king following Harold's death in 1040, and his half-brother Edward followed Harthacnut to England; Edward was proclaimed king after Harthacnut's death in June 1042.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the fort}} {{appears to have been}} started by Fumomadi, Sultan of Pate. The Mazrui leader Abdalla bin Hemed, in an uneasy {{alliance}} with Pate, was also involved in the construction. <b>One</b> <b>story</b> was built, but with the death of Funomadi in 1809 construction halted. In 1812 Lamu gained an unexpected victory at the Battle of Shela over the forces of Pate and Mombasa. The continued threat prompted them to call for help from Oman. Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman (r. 1804–1856), was said to have assisted in the renewed construction, which began in 1813 and was completed around 1821.|$|E
5|$|Cormier {{was known}} for his {{physical}} strength and intense exercise regimen. He was known to bench press 450 pounds with each, and he was once recorded as bench pressing 527 pounds.

5|$|Edward had a {{reputation}} for a fierce temper, and he could be intimidating; <b>one</b> <b>story</b> tells of how the Dean of St Paul's, wishing to confront Edward over the high level of taxation in 1295, fell down and died once he was in the King's presence. When Edward of Caernarfon demanded an earldom for his favourite Gaveston, the King erupted in anger and supposedly tore out handfuls of his son's hair. Some of his contemporaries considered Edward frightening, particularly in his early days. The Song of Lewes in 1264 described him as a leopard, an animal regarded as particularly powerful and unpredictable.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{was also}} notable {{in his time}} for his extravagant lifestyle. The deaths {{of his father and}} elder brother while he was still a young man {{provided}} Harvey with a considerable fortune, much of which he squandered gambling in London. Harvey's exploits at the gaming tables became legendary, <b>one</b> <b>story</b> claiming that he once bet £100,000 on a single game of chance and lost, only to win most of it back on the following throw. Despite his dissolute lifestyle, Harvey was married and had numerous children; he was survived by six daughters and had three sons who predeceased him.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting {{his players}} {{to be more}} {{distinctly}} dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter pillar box red. Two possibilities have been suggested for {{the origin of the}} white sleeves. <b>One</b> <b>story</b> reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf.|$|E
5|$|It is {{unlikely}} that it was supernatural affairs and Paulinus' persuasion alone that caused Edwin to convert. The Northumbrian nobles {{seem to have been}} willing and the king also received letters from Pope Boniface V urging his conversion. Eventually convinced, Edwin and many of his followers were baptised at York in 627. <b>One</b> <b>story</b> relates that during a stay with Edwin and Æthelburg at their palace in Yeavering, Paulinus spent 36days baptising new converts. Paulinus also was an active missionary in Lindsey, and his missionary activities help show the limits of Edwin's royal authority.|$|E
5|$|Lansdale {{employed}} {{a variety of}} stunts to encourage more northerners to move south. South Vietnamese soldiers in civilian clothing infiltrated the north, spreading rumours of impending doom. <b>One</b> <b>story</b> was that the communists had a deal with Vietnam's traditional enemy China, allowing two communist Chinese divisions to invade the north. The story reported that the Chinese were raping and pillaging with the tacit approval of the communists. Lansdale hired counterfeiters to produce bogus Viet Minh leaflets on how to behave under communist rule, advising them to create a list of their material possessions so that the communists {{would be able to}} confiscate them more easily, thereby fomenting peasant discontent.|$|E

Waltham Abbey, which had been founded by Harold, later claimed that his body had been {{secretly}} buried there. Other legends claimed that Harold did not die at Hastings, but escaped and became a hermit at Chester.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Kingdom Hearts II {{is similar}} to the action RPG and hack and slash gameplay of the first Kingdom Hearts game, though developers made an effort to address some of the complaints with the previous game. The player directly controls Sora from a third-person camera angle, though first-person perspective is available via Select button. Most of the gameplay occurs on interconnected field maps where battles take place. The game is driven by a linear progression from <b>one</b> <b>story</b> event to the next, usually told via cutscenes, though there are numerous side-quests available that provide bonuses to characters.|$|E
5|$|The gharial is {{featured}} in the folk tales of India. In <b>one</b> <b>story,</b> a gharial and a monkey become friends when the monkey gives the gharial fruit. The gharial's wife demands that her husband bring home the monkey to eat, believing that the fruit made the monkey's heart sweet. The gharial complies at first and attempts to lure the monkey to his home, but soon comes clean about the plan. Their friendship ends after that. Similar stories exist in Native American legends, and in the African American folktale of an alligator and Br'er Rabbit.|$|E
