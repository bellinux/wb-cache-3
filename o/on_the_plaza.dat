50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plaza</b> was {{investigated}} by Patrick Culbert of the University of Pennsylvania in 1963, concentrating <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plaza's</b> stratigraphy and also clearing <b>the</b> palace <b>on</b> <b>the</b> southern side. Major excavations of <b>the</b> <b>plaza</b> started in January 1983 under Vilma Fialko, {{with the objective}} of consolidating <b>the</b> seven temples <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east side of <b>the</b> <b>plaza,</b> and palace structure 5D-92 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> southeast corner.|$|R
50|$|Teatro Español, {{the oldest}} theater in Madrid, is located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plaza's</b> east side. It {{was built in}} seventeenth century and then had the name Corral del Príncipe. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> west side of <b>the</b> <b>plaza,</b> a luxury hotel (now ME Madrid Reina Victoria) {{was built in the}} early nineteenth century. The hotel {{achieved}} fame for being the favorite among the most popular bullfighters. For example, the regular guest Manolete always reserved room number 220 in superstition. <b>The</b> <b>plaza</b> is a popular meeting point in Madrid.|$|R
5|$|The two {{auxiliary}} buildings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plaza</b> {{are used}} by the American Legion. Both buildings were constructed from Indiana limestone in neoclassical style, similar to the public library just to the north. The east building at Meridian and St. Clair, designated building B on the original plan, houses the Indiana Department of the American Legion, the American Legion Auxiliary, and the National Forty and Eight. The four-story building served as the national headquarters until the second building was completed.|$|E
5|$|All {{three of}} the stelae were {{discovered}} by Teoberto Maler in 1901 {{near one of the}} site's main temple, the O-13 pyramid. Stela 13 was possibly erected on a terrace reached by the pyramid's main stairway, and Stela 18 lies in a row <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plaza</b> in front of the aforementioned stairway. Stela 23, on the other hand, was erected at the very base of the pyramid. This pyramid was most likely the burial place for Itzam K'an Ahk II, and—seeing as how Ha' K'in Xook, Yo'nal Ahk III, and K'inich Yat Ahk II all revered the site as a dynastic shrine—it is further evidence to back the argument that Ha' K'in Xook was the son of Itzam K'an Ahk II.|$|E
5|$|Casa Álvarez-Buiza, {{a private}} house and {{commercial}} complex, {{was built in}} the San Juan district by Adel Franco Pinna between 1918–2.

Artistic elements include the use of lime, brick and colorful ceramics with an Andalusian influence. Casa del Cordón is a private house, built in the late Gothic style of the early 16th century, and has mullioned windows. It currently houses the Archdiocese. Casa Puebla, built in 1921, is one of the other designs of Pinna, who designed numerous buildings around Badajoz.
