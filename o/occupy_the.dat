5|$|There are {{a number}} of small named-places in and around Milnrow, {{including}} Clegg, Firgrove, Gallows, Haugh, Newhey, Kitcliffe, Ogden, and Tunshill.

The Gallows public house is said to <b>occupy</b> <b>the</b> land of an ancient execution site; Gallows, a former hamlet at northeastern Milnrow, is named in reference to a baronial gallows. Kitcliffe, Ogden and Tunshill, to the east of central Milnrow, are hamlets that <b>occupy</b> <b>the</b> upper, mid and lower Piethorne Valley respectively.|$|E

In 1913, Edgar Quinet participated in an international naval demonstration that also included British, German, and Austro-Hungarian vessels off Albania.

5|$|Among ectoparasites, bats carry fleas and mites, {{as well as}} {{specific}} parasites such as bat bugs and bat flies (Nycteribiidae and Streblidae). However, {{they are one of}} the few non-aquatic mammalian orders that do not host lice. This may be due to competition from more effective, specialized parasites which <b>occupy</b> <b>the</b> same niche.|$|E
5|$|Andrew II {{made several}} {{attempts}} to <b>occupy</b> <b>the</b> neighboring Principality of Halych. His son, Béla, persuaded {{a group of}} Cumans to accept AndrewII's suzerainty in 1228 and established a new march in Oltenia (known as the Banate of Szörény) in 1231. Béla IV succeeded his father in 1235. His attempt to reacquire crown lands alienated by his predecessors created a deep rift between the monarch and the lords just as the Mongols were sweeping westward across the Eurasian steppes.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the world}} wars, chess was {{revolutionized}} {{by the new}} theoretical school of so-called hypermodernists like Aron Nimzowitsch and Richard Réti.

5|$|Cricket is {{more similar}} to {{baseball}} than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by {{the importance of the}} batting partnership and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may <b>occupy</b> <b>the</b> wicket for an hour or much more. There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.|$|E
5|$|Currie {{regarded}} {{control of}} either Hill 70 or Sallaumines Hill as tactically {{more important than}} control {{of the city of}} Lens. Merely to <b>occupy</b> <b>the</b> city while the Germans held the high ground, would place the attackers in an unfavourably lower and more exposed position than the ones they occupied. At a conference of corps commanders, Currie persuaded the First Army commander General Henry Horne to make Hill 70, not Lens, the main objective of the limited offensive. Controlling Hill 70 would provide excellent observation over the German lines, in preparation for more offensives. Currie believed the Germans would attempt to counter-attack if Hill 70 were captured, largely because of its observational importance. Nevertheless, Currie believed that the advantageous observational position of Hill 70 would permit well directed artillery to effectively deal with any counter-attacks. The plan was therefore to <b>occupy</b> <b>the</b> high ground quickly, establish defensive positions and utilize combined small arms and artillery fire to repel expected counter-attacks and inflict as many casualties as possible.|$|E

5|$|During the Torstenson War, {{a theater}} of the Thirty Years' War, {{extensive}} combat {{took place in the}} Danish provinces of Skåne, Halland, and Blekinge.
