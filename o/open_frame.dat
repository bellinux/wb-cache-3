25|$|Historically, women's bicycle frames had a {{top tube}} that {{connected}} {{in the middle}} of the seat tube instead of the top, resulting in a lower standover height. This was to allow the rider to dismount while wearing a skirt or dress. The design has since been used in utility bikes to facilitate easy mounting and dismounting for both genders, and is also known as a step-through frame or an <b>open</b> <b>frame.</b> Another style that accomplishes similar results is the mixte.|$|E
25|$|In general, one pin is scored {{for each}} pin that is knocked over. So {{if a player}} bowls over three pins with the first shot, then six with the second, the player would receive a total of nine pins for that frame. If a player knocks down nine pins with the first shot, but misses with the second, the player would also score nine. When a player fails to knock down all ten pins after their second ball it is known as an <b>open</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Zephyr was a two bay biplane {{with wings}} without stagger or sweep and of {{constant}} chord with square tips. It was a pusher design, {{reminiscent of the}} Royal Aircraft Factory F.E series, for example the FE8, with a full fuselage replaced with a pod or nacelle with the cockpit and the engine behind it, the empennage supported on an <b>open</b> <b>frame.</b> The Zephyr's pilot sat under the front wing with a long but downward sloping nose ahead of him. Four booms ran rearwards from the wings, two on each side converging in the vertical plane from the inner interplane struts to the tail, with rectangular bracing to stiffen them. The tailplane was mounted at {{the meeting of the}} booms and twin triangular fins, each bearing a near rectangular rudder were placed at the ends of each vertical pair of booms. The twin-wheeled main undercarriage was supplemented bu twin sprung tails skids, one under each fin.|$|E

40|$|An <b>open</b> reading <b>frame</b> {{upstream}} from nifHDK operon of Klebsiella pneumoniae had been described. The orientation of this <b>open</b> reading <b>frame</b> is opposite {{to that of}} nifHDK and sequence homology {{was found between the}} <b>open</b> reading <b>frame</b> promoter and the promoter of nifHDK operon. A recombinant plasmid carrying the promoter region of the <b>open</b> reading <b>frame</b> fused to the beta-galactosidase gene was constructed. Strains of E. coli were transformed with the plasmid containing this <b>open</b> reading <b>frame</b> promoter-lacZ fusion or co-transformed with it and a plasmid carrying the nifA gene. An appreciable activity of beta-galactosidase was found in strains which received both plasmids, indicating that the promoter of the <b>open</b> reading <b>frame</b> can be activated by the product of nifA gene. Thus, the <b>open</b> reading <b>frame</b> found between nifHDK operon and nifJ behaves just like other nif genes of K. pneumoniae in requiring the product of nifA as the positive effector for expression...|$|R
25|$|As {{with many}} 19th-century theatres, the Brooklyn Theatre's stage was a {{presentation}} platform, a prop factory and a warehouse. At {{the back of}} the stage was the painter's bridge, a walkway which ran the width of the stage and which could be raised or lowered as required for painting backdrops, or drops. These and borders, scenic elements painted on canvas and mounted on wooden frames, were installed in a rigging loft,known as a Fly System, a large wooden <b>open</b> <b>frame</b> equipped with the pulleys and tackle needed to raise or lower scenic elements. It was suspended high in the fly space or , the volume above the stage never seen by the audience. For a large production with many scene changes, the rigging loft could be heavily loaded with painted canvas. On the night of the fire, it contained drops and borders for The Two Orphans. and the scenery for Julius Caesar was stacked on the stage, awaiting pickup. This would have some bearing on the fire's outset, when stage manager Thorpe considered getting the hose, but was hampered by scenery.|$|E
25|$|Bowling has {{a unique}} scoring system which keeps track {{not only of the}} current pinfall in a frame, but also strikes and spares which allow for the value of {{subsequent}} pinfall. Effectively, there are three kinds of marks given in a score; a strike (all ten down in the first ball), a spare (all ten down by the second ball), and an open (one or more missed pins still standing after the second ball). A strike earns ten pins plus the pins for the next two balls thrown. (For example, if a player got a strike then followed with a 7 then 2, their value for the strike frame would be 10+7+2, or 19.) A spare earns ten pins plus the pins for the next ball thrown. (Again, if a player gets a spare then follows it with 7 pins down on the first ball of the next frame, their value for the spare frame would be 10+7, or 17.) A strike after a spare would earn 20 pins. The same score would be obtained if the reverse occurred. Open frames count the value of the pinfall in that frame only. (Example: if a player knocks down 5 on their first ball and 3 on their second, the <b>open</b> <b>frame</b> would be worth 8 pins.) The maximum score in ten-pin bowling is 300. This consists of getting 12 strikes in a row in one game (one strike each in frames 1â€“9, all three possible strikes in the tenth frame), and is also known as a perfect game.|$|E

40|$|The {{sequence}} of a 5 '-proximal region of mRNA 5 of coronavirus MHV-JHM {{was determined by}} chain-terminator sequencing of cDNA subcloned in M 13. The sequence contained two long <b>open</b> reading <b>frames</b> of 321 bases and 264 bases, overlapping by five bases but in different <b>frames.</b> Both <b>open</b> reading <b>frames</b> are initiated by AUG codons in sequence contexts that are relatively infrequently used as initiator codons.

With {{the exception of the}} AUG codon initiating the downstream <b>open</b> reading <b>frame,</b> no internal AUG codons were found within the sequence overed by the upstream <b>open</b> reading <b>frame.</b> These results suggest that the MHV-JHM mRNA 5 is translated to produce two proteins by a mechanism involving internal initiation of protein synthesis.

We compared 34 intron-encoded <b>open</b> reading <b>frames</b> and four related <b>open</b> reading <b>frames</b> {{that are not}} encoded in introns. Many of these <b>open</b> reading <b>frames</b> have a reverse transcriptase-like domain, followed by an additional conserved domain X, and a Zn(2 +) -finger-like region. Some <b>open</b> reading <b>frames</b> have lost conserved sequence blocks or key amino acids characteristic of functional reverse transcriptases, and some lack the Zn(2 +) -finger-like region. The <b>open</b> reading <b>frames</b> encoded by the chloroplast tRNA(Lys) genes and the related Epifagus virginiana matK <b>open</b> reading <b>frame</b> lack a Zn(2 +) -finger-like region and have only remnants of a reverse transcriptase-like domain, but retain a readily identifiable domain X. Several findings lead us to speculate that domain X may function in binding of the intron RNA during reverse transcription and RNA splicing. Overall, our {{findings are consistent with}} the hypothesis that all of the known group II intron <b>open</b> reading <b>frames</b> evolved from an ancestral <b>open</b> reading <b>frame,</b> which contained reverse transcriptase, X, and Zn(2 +) -finger-like domains, and that the reverse transcriptase and Zn(2 +) -finger-like domains were lost in some cases. The retention of domain X in most proteins may reflect an essential function in RNA splicing, which is independent of the reverse transcriptase activity of these proteins...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Approximately 40 % of {{mammalian}} mRNA sequences contain AUG trinucleotides upstream of {{the main}} coding sequence, with a quarter of these AUGs demarcating <b>open</b> reading <b>frames</b> of 20 or more codons. In order to investigate whether these <b>open</b> reading <b>frames</b> may encode functional peptides, we have carried out a comparative genomic analysis of human and mouse mRNA 'untranslated regions' using sequences from the RefSeq mRNA sequence database. Results We have identified over 200 upstream <b>open</b> reading <b>frames</b> which are strongly conserved between the human and mouse genomes. Consensus sequences associated with efficient initiation of translation are overrepresented at the AUG trinucleotides of these upstream <b>open</b> reading <b>frames,</b> while comparative analysis of their DNA and putative peptide sequences shows evidence of purifying selection. Conclusion The occurrence {{of a large number}} of conserved upstream <b>open</b> reading <b>frames,</b> in association with features consistent with protein translation, strongly suggests evolutionary maintenance of the coding sequence and indicates probable functional expression of the peptides encoded within these upstream <b>open</b> reading <b>frames.</b> </p...|$|R

2500|$|Historically, women's bicycle frames had a {{top tube}} that {{connected}} {{in the middle}} of the seat tube instead of the top, resulting in a lower standover height at the expense of compromised structural integrity, since this places a strong bending load in the seat tube, and bicycle frame members are typically weak in bending. This design, referred to as a step-through frame or as an <b>open</b> <b>frame,</b> allows the rider to mount and dismount in a dignified way while wearing a skirt or dress. While some women's bicycles continue to use this frame style, there is also a variation, the mixte, which splits the top tube laterally into two thinner top tubes that bypass the seat tube on each side and connect to the rear fork ends. The ease of stepping through is also appreciated by those with limited flexibility or other joint problems. Because of its persistent image as a [...] "women's" [...] bicycle, step-through frames are not common for larger frames.|$|E
2500|$|The major {{differences}} between the two were in the fuselages. The ZÃ¶gling had a very simple <b>open</b> <b>frame</b> girder fuselage, the PrÃ¼fling a more conventional hexagonal cross section, wood framed structure, ply covered forward from under the wing and fabric covered aft. The wing was supported over the fuselage with a pair of parallel lift struts on each side, bracing it at almost mid-span at the spars to the lower fuselage longerons. The open cockpit was below the wing centre section which was supported by two pairs of cabane struts to the upper fuselage longerons. The forward pair, placed {{just in front of the}} cockpit were single, upright struts but the rear ones, just behind, were each an inverted V-pair.
