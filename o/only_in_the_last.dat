Although Johnson had begun {{his career as a}} relatively cautious publisher of religious and scientific tracts, he was now able to take more risks and he encouraged friends to recommend works to him, creating a network of informal reviewers. Yet Johnson's business was never large; he usually had only one assistant and never took on an apprentice. <b>Only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> years of his life did two relatives assist him.|$|E
5|$|In 1533, {{at the age}} of fourteen, Catherine married Henry, {{second son}} of King Francis I and Queen Claude of France. Throughout his reign, Henry {{excluded}} Catherine from participating in state affairs and instead showered favours on his chief mistress, Diane de Poitiers, who wielded much influence over him. Henry's death thrust Catherine into the political arena as mother of the frail fifteen-year-old King Francis II. When he died in 1560, she became regent on behalf of her ten-year-old son King Charles IX and was granted sweeping powers. After Charles died in 1574, Catherine {{played a key role in}} the reign of her third son, Henry III. He dispensed with her advice <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> months of her life.|$|E

5|$|In pre-Columbian times, the Lees Ferry {{area was}} {{inhabited}} first by Paleo-Indians, who populated the region beginning about 11,500 years ago, {{followed by the}} Archaic culture, which appeared on the Colorado Plateau about 8,000 years ago. The Anasazi, Paiute and Navajo peoples, who left more evidence of habitation in the valley, arrived <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 1,000 years or so. Evidence, including the discovery of two ruins nearby on the Paria River, suggests that the Anasazi utilized the area sometime in the 12th century A.D. Nonetheless, indigenous peoples generally did not make extensive use of the Lees Ferry area and other canyon stretches of the Colorado River, preferring the open plains above for hunting. However, Lees Ferry did later become a disputed territory between the Navajos and Paiutes, who recognized it as a valuable livestock watering point.|$|E

After being driven out of Burma in 1942, a provisional regiment of the U.S. Army (Merrill's Marauders) participated in the reconquest of Northern Burma in 1944, and two regiments took part in the Central Burma Campaign the following year before moving on into China. In response to U.S. Army Air Forces operations from China, the Japanese drove the Americans and Chinese from eastern China. <b>Only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> weeks of the war did the tide turn in favor of the Allies in China.|$|E
