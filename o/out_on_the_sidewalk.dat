500|$|When Chapter 27 premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, {{the film}} was debated {{fiercely}} by critics. A website reported, [...] "the audience's reactions made it obvious that some people would love it and others would not." [...] Andrew O'Hehir from Salon wrote, [...] "Some viewers may well find Chapter 27 sleazy or distasteful, and I won't argue the point. But Schaefer's movie creates its own highly compelling world, which {{is pretty much the}} prime directive in filmmaking." [...] He stated that [...] "Leto almost makes you feel how it happened," [...] and called his acting a [...] "highly compelling performance on many levels." [...] He also enjoyed Lohan's performance. Duane Byrge of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Chapter 27 is a smart attempt to distill the twisted psychology and motivation of Mark David Chapman, which we've all superficially gleaned through mass-media reports and intermittent updates on Chapman's incarceration." [...] He praised Leto's acting saying, [...] "Jared Leto is mesmeric as the bloated, deranged Chapman. It's a brilliantly measured performance, evincing the tale of a madman through his own awful rhyme and reason." [...] He also praised Schaefer's direction, the other cast and crew. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three out of four stars saying, [...] "By the end of this modest, strange venture, Leto made me believe it was worth being forced to hang <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> with this man, if only to get a creeping sense of what that might've been like." ...|$|E

25|$|The Aladdin was {{scheduled}} to reopen on August 17, 2000, at 6:00p.m., with fireworks at 10:00p.m. The opening was delayed while the Clark County building inspector completed its fire safety testing. Another delay was caused by last-minute repairs to the casino surveillance system. This left thousands of Aladdin visitors leaving in disappointment, as well as opening night hotel guests wondering where they'd spend the night. Many high-rollers waited <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> {{in front of the}} Aladdin for hours. Most were unable to even get to their luggage, since the hotel had been locked down for testing. Aladdin employees tried to arrange alternate accommodations for the guests with Paris and Bellagio.|$|R
6000|$|The boys came bustling {{back and}} hurried the girls <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> [...] "They're coming!" [...] they cried breathlessly, as a far-off burst of music {{came in on}} a warm puff of wind.|$|E
60|$|One of {{the strange}} cadets was driving the automobile, and hardly had it {{come to a stop}} when Merwell and Jasniff bounded <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> {{directly}} in front of Dave and his friends.|$|E
60|$|But {{to follow}} Dan Baxter up {{was out of}} the question, as they speedily {{discovered}} when they stepped <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> People were hurrying in all directions, and the bully had been completely swallowed up in the crowd.|$|E
60|$|In {{front of}} the hotel ran a veranda {{supported}} on wooden pillars, and a row of chairs was set <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> match-strewn <b>sidewalk</b> beneath it. Most of them were occupied by after-supper loungers, and several of the men bore scars. Prescott stopped and lighted his pipe.|$|R
2500|$|He recounted an {{incident}} being assaulted while walking home at night, telling {{the press in}} 1971 that the two young muggers attempted to grab his arms, but he broke free and laid them both <b>out</b> cold <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> <b>The</b> story of the encounter appeared in the Hendersonville Times-News, and reported the incident had taken place [...] "a few years [...] ".|$|R

60|$|Once <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> Hal did {{not know}} exactly how to proceed.

60|$|Sanford Quest and Lenora stood {{side by side}} {{upon the}} steps of the Courthouse, waiting for the {{automobile}} which had become momentarily entangled in a string of vehicles. A little crowd of people were elbowing their way <b>out</b> <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> <b>The</b> faces of most of them were still shadowed by the three hours of tense drama from which they had just emerged. Quest, who had lit a cigar, watched them curiously.|$|R
50|$|In {{the ensuing}} decades, Vila Carrão {{could not escape}} from the {{economic}} and social problems of the big city that engulfed it. It has long lost the quiet suburban atmosphere still remembered by its older residents, who until the 1960s and 1970s would put <b>out</b> chairs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> every evening, and spend some time chatting with their neighbours while their children played in the streets. Today, as {{in most parts of the}} city, houses are walled up, windows are behind bars, and the streets are no longer suitable for play or chat.|$|R
2500|$|On {{a recent}} trip to Sydney, Australia, I noticed that the city has placed hotel-style {{ashtrays}} filled with sand <b>on</b> <b>sidewalks</b> throughout <b>the</b> central business district and the historic area called [...] "the Rocks." [...] Smokers obviously use them; I almost never saw cigarette butts crushed <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> streets or <b>sidewalks</b> in this delightfully clean and friendly city.|$|R
60|$|Later on, Dickensen went <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> {{to smoke}} a cigar and cool off; {{and a little}} later Emily Travis {{happened}} along. Emily Travis was dainty and delicate and rare, and whether in London or Klondike she gowned herself as befitted {{the daughter of a}} millionnaire mining engineer. Little Dickensen deposited his cigar on an outside window ledge where he could find it again, and lifted his hat.|$|E
60|$|On {{only one}} point {{difficulty}} still remained. That was {{the closing of}} the bar. Mr. Smith could never bring his mind to it,--not as a matter of profit, but as a point of honour. It was too much for him to feel that Judge Pepperleigh might be <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> thirsty at midnight, that the night hands of the Times-Herald on Wednesday might be compelled to go home dry. On this point Mr. Smith's moral code was simplicity itself,--do what is right and take the consequences. So the bar stayed open.|$|E
60|$|Josiah turned obediently. He {{heard the}} door slam as he went down the walk. As in a {{nightmare}} he opened the gate he had opened ten thousand times and stepped <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> He felt dazed. Surely it was a dream. Very soon he would wake up {{with a sigh of}} relief. He rubbed his forehead and paused indecisively. The monotonous complaint of the bucksaw came to his ears. If that boy had any of the old Childs spirit in him, sooner or later he'd run away. Agatha was beyond the endurance of human flesh. She had not changed, unless for the worse, if such a thing were possible. That boy would surely run for it, maybe soon. Maybe now.|$|E

5000|$|He recounted an {{incident}} being assaulted while walking home at night, telling {{the press in}} 1971 that the two young muggers attempted to grab his arms, but he broke free and laid them both <b>out</b> cold <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> <b>The</b> story of the encounter appeared in the Hendersonville Times-News, and reported the incident had taken place [...] "a few years earlier".In 1977, in collaboration with his daughter Barbara Lynn, Dempsey published his autobiography, titled Dempsey. In tribute to his legacy and boxing career, a PBS documentary summarized [...] "Dempsey's boxing style consisted of constantly bobbing and weaving. His attacks were furious and sustained. Behind it all was rage. His aggressive behavior prompted a rule that boxers had to retreat to a neutral corner and give opponents who had been knocked down {{a chance to get}} up." [...] According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, constant attack was his strategic defense.In 2011, Dempsey was posthumously inducted into the Irish American Hall of Fame.|$|R
60|$|The {{improvement}} of the tenement-house has gone {{hand in hand with}} that of the apartment-house. As nearly as the rate of interest on the landlord's investment will allow, the housing of the poor approaches in comfort that of the rich. Their children are still more numerous, and the playgrounds supplied them in every open space and on every pier are visited constantly by the better-to-do children, who exchange with them lessons of form and fashion for the scarcely less valuable instruction in practical life which the poorer little ones are able to give. The rents in the tenement houses are reduced even more notably than those in the apartment-houses, so that now, with the constant increase in wages, the tenants are able to pay their rents promptly. The evictions once so common are very rare; it is doubtful whether a nightly or daily walk in the poorer quarters of the town would develop, in the coldest weather, half a dozen cases of families set <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> with their household goods about them.|$|E
60|$|Meantime the provision-stores add much {{to their}} effect of crazy gayety on the avenues. The variety and harmony of colors is very great, {{and this morning}} I stood so long admiring the {{arrangement}} {{in one of them}} that I am afraid I rendered myself a little suspicious to the policeman guarding the liquor-store on the nearest corner; there seems always to be a policeman assigned to this duty. The display was {{on either side of the}} provisioner's door, and began, on one hand, with a basal line of pumpkins well <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> Then it was built up with the soft white and cool green of cauliflowers and open boxes of red and white grapes, to the window that flourished in banks of celery and rosy apples. On the other side, gray-green squashes formed the foundation, and the wall was sloped upward with the delicious salads you can find here, the dark red of beets, the yellow of carrots, and the blue of cabbages. The association of colors was very artistic, and even the line of mutton carcasses overhead, with each a brace of grouse or half a dozen quail in its embrace, and flanked with long sides of beef at the four ends of the line, was picturesque, though the sight of the carnage at the provision-stores here would always be dreadful to an Altrurian; in the great markets it is intolerable. This sort of business is mostly in the hands of the Germans, who have a good eye for such effects as may be studied in it; but the fruiterers are nearly all Italians, and their stalls are charming. I always like, too, the cheeriness of the chestnut and peanut ovens of the Italians; the pleasant smell and friendly smoke that rise from them suggest a simple and homelike life which there are so any things in this great, weary, heedless city to make one forget.|$|E
6000|$|Of all the Spanish {{cities that}} I saw, Seville {{was the most}} charming, not for those attributive blandishments of the song and dance which the tourist is {{supposed}} to find it, but which we quite failed of, but for the simpler and less conventional amiabilities which she was so rich in. I have tried to hint at these, but really one must go to Seville for them and let them happen as they will. Many happened in our hotel where we liked everybody, from the kindly, most capable Catalonian head waiter to the fine-headed little Napoleonic-looking waiter who had identified us at San Sebastian as Americans, because we spoke [...] "quicklier" [...] than the English, and who ran to us when we came into the hotel and shook hands with its {{as if we were}} his oldest and dearest friends. There was a Swiss concierge who could not be bought for money, and the manager was the mirror of managers. Fancy the landlord of the Waldorf-Astoria, or the St. Regis, coming <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> and beating down a taxicabman from a charge of fifteen pesetas to six for a certain drive! It is not thinkable, and yet the like of it happened to xis in Seville from our manager. It was not his fault, when our rear apartment became a little too chill, and we took a parlor in the front and came back on the first day hoping to find it stored full of the afternoon sun's warmth, but found that the camerera had opened the windows and closed the shutters in our absence so that our parlor was of a frigidity which no glitter of the electric light could temper. The halls and public rooms were chill in anticipation and remembrance of any cold outside, but in otir parlor there was a hole for the sort of stove which we saw in the reading-room, twice as large as an average teakettle, with a pipe as big around as the average rain-pipe. I am sure this apparatus would have heated us admirably, but the weather grew milder and milder and we never had occasion to make the successful experiment. Meanwhile the moral atmosphere of the hotel was of a blandness which would have gone far to content us with any meteorological perversity. When we left it we were on those human terms with every one who ruled or served in it which one never attains in an American hotel, and rarely in an English one.|$|E
50|$|The Black Banana {{suffered}} a devastating fire in 1991. Much {{of the staff}} worked day and night demolishing and rebuilding the club.

60|$|He leaped lightly {{from the}} carriage, and {{pushed his way}} <b>out</b> of sight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> Boyne {{remained}} alone in the vehicle, staring wildly round; the driver kept slowly and stupidly on, Boyne {{did not know how}} much farther. He could not speak; {{he felt as if he}} could not stir. But the moment came when he could not be still. He gave a galvanic jump to the ground, and <b>the</b> friendly crowd <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> welcomed him to its ranks and closed about him. The driver had taken the lefthand corner, just before a plain carriage with the Queen and the queen-mother came in sight round the right. The young Queen was bowing to the people, gently, and with a sort of mechanical regularity. Now and then a brighter smile than that she conventionally wore lighted up her face. The simple progress was absolutely without state, except for <b>the</b> aide-de-camp <b>on</b> horseback who rode beside the carriage, a little to the front.|$|R
40|$|Captain J. N. Dolph (visiting field {{director}} of the American Red Cross) : “It would pay Denver to make far more extensive use {{of a number of}} practical precautions proven valuable in other cities in fighting the influenza epidemic. Denver is one of a very few cities allowing the display of fruits and vegetables in uncovered boxes and baskets <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> public <b>sidewalk</b> in front of stores. At least a covering of glass or cloth ought to be required for the sake of public health during an epidemic such as the present one. A dangerous sprit of carelessness is also shown by extensive spitting on sidewalks, grouping in cigar stores, around sale counters in other stores and in various places. There has {{been a great deal of}} criticism and pooh-poohing about the wearing of masks as a precaution, but the 50 per cent prevention proven for these masks is at least 50 per cent helpful. Salt Lake City has used masks extensively, prevented all kinds of large groupings of persons and practiced every practical kind of precaution known. It now has the epidemic practically stamped out. These statements are made for the public welfare, and are intended as suggestions for playing safe and not as criticisms. ”Newspaper article...|$|R

6000|$|I am of that {{habit of}} mind that makes me prone to listen. And for this, perhaps, Mr. Sims selects me as the {{recipient}} of the stories of his college days.

[...] In the recollection of my good friend this [...] "old gang" [...] were of a devilishness since lost off the earth. Work they wouldn't. Sleep they despised.

60|$|This was, of course, the unjust {{effect of}} my {{original}} exaggeration of their length and breadth. The troops that I saw marching {{through the streets}} where we first lodged were fine, large men. I myself saw no choice in the different bodies, but the little housemaid much preferred the grenadier guards to the Scotch guards; perhaps there was one grenadier guard who lent beauty and grandeur to the rest. I think Scotch caps are much gayer than those busbies which the grenadiers wear, but that, again, {{is a matter of}} taste; I certainly did not think the plaid pantaloons with which the Scotch guards hid the knees that ought to have been naked were as good as the plain trousers of their rivals. But they were all well enough, and the officers who sauntered along <b>out</b> of step <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> or stoop-shoulderedly, as the English military fashion now is, followed <b>the</b> troops <b>on</b> horseback, were splendid fellows, who would go to battle as simply as to afternoon tea, and get themselves shot in some imperial cause as impersonally as their men.|$|R
