40|$|Master of Public HealthPublic Health Interdepartmental ProgramJustin J. KastnerThe Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) of 2011 {{explicitly}} and implicitly {{charges the}} food industry with the responsibility of protecting food supply chains against intentional contamination. This field experience was conducted at a global food ingredients manufacturing facility located in the Midwestern United States. The field experience aimed at increasing the food defense readiness of the facility to a level more consistent with the mandates promulgated by FSMA. A food defense audit was conducted to assess the food defense vulnerabilities present at the facility. Vulnerabilities were assessed relating to (1) food defense plan management, (2) outside security, (3) inside security, and (4) personnel security relating to the facility. The food defense audit provided recommendations to mitigate any identified vulnerabilities; additionally, strategies were proposed to implement those recommendations. A brief overview is given of the recommendations that were either approved for immediate implementation or were placed under review for possible, future implementation. Finally, a working document was written that {{will serve as the}} official food defense plan of the facility. The food defense plan is a confidential document that contains information about the pertinent physical and geographical characteristics of the facility, contact information for local law enforcement, fire departments, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), state and national homeland security departments, and <b>other</b> <b>important</b> <b>contact</b> information. The plan briefly discusses the food defense audit results, and gives an overview of the security procedures for the management of the food defense plan, outside security, inside security, and personnel security. At the request of the company, this document was created as a working document, so some sections were left incomplete and will be completed at a later date by the company as decisions about procedures and personnel are made. Due to the confidential nature of the food defense plan, this field experience report contains a summary of the plan...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of how the international department of a business school in one Australian university organised staff induction to ensure academic quality assurance for Transnational Education (TNE) students in business courses. Discussed also are some of the organisational challenges brought about by distance, culture, language, pedagogic differences and practices encountered at various locations. Strategies emergent from a new staff induction program implemented by Curtin Business School (CBSi) international office informed the continuous improvement of the induction processes and quality assurance matters aligned to these. Of particular importance to the staff induction program discussed here are the approach to workloads and role clarity. Matters of quality assurance and equivalence of the learning experience for TNE students are also explored from the perspective of having operational practices that are universally understood and seamlessly applied across multiple campuses. The organisational learning from the program additionally {{led to the development of}} a readily updateable induction resource artefact (USB based) that was relevant to all locations, including the main campus. This staff-use artefact includes of a suite of text and video based resources detailing course materials, approved practices, protocols, and contact links. It is designed to act as the first point of enquiry for staff seeking further information or assistance with all aspects of their teaching and learning in CBSi transnational education courses. At the commencement of each teaching period, all staff teaching in CBSi courses are now issued with a copy of the USB, or for those already with a copy, have this updated via the web to reflect changes in unit coordinators or <b>other</b> <b>important</b> personnel <b>contacts,</b> course changes, or regulatory information. The USB format for this resource was chosen to ensure staff not having ideal internet access could still access the materials via personal computers...|$|R
