5|$|<b>Open</b> <b>water</b> is {{unrestricted}} water {{such as a}} sea, lake or flooded quarry, {{where the}} diver has direct vertical access {{to the surface of}} the water in contact with the atmosphere. <b>Open</b> <b>water</b> diving implies that if a problem arises, the diver can directly ascend vertically to the atmosphere to breathe air.|$|E

5|$|The emperor penguin's diet {{consists}} {{mainly of}} fish, crustaceans and cephalopods, although its composition varies from population to population. Fish {{are usually the}} most important food source, and the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) makes {{up the bulk of}} the bird's diet. Other prey commonly recorded include other fish of the family Nototheniidae, the glacial squid (Psychroteuthis glacialis), and the hooked squid species Kondakovia longimana, as well as Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The emperor penguin searches for prey in the <b>open</b> <b>water</b> of the Southern Ocean, in either ice-free areas of <b>open</b> <b>water</b> or tidal cracks in pack ice. One of its feeding strategies is to dive to around , where it can easily spot sympagic fish like the bald notothen (Pagothenia borchgrevinki) swimming against the bottom surface of the sea-ice; it swims up {{to the bottom of the}} ice and catches the fish. It then dives again and repeats the sequence about half a dozen times before surfacing to breathe.|$|E
5|$|The storm moved entirely off the {{coastline}} and into <b>open</b> <b>water</b> at around 9:45pm. It then dissipated rapidly around 9:55pm, directly east of Gosford. It was subsequently downgraded from severe {{status and the}} storm cell had faded completely by 10:00pm.|$|E

5|$|Thirty-seven athletes {{represented}} Team GB in {{the swimming}} events. Selection followed the 2008 British Olympic Swimming Trials in Sheffield in April, with <b>open</b> <b>water</b> event swimmers selected after {{performance in the}} 2008 World <b>Open</b> <b>Water</b> Swimming Championships, in Seville, Spain. In winning six medals (two gold, two silver and two bronze) the team bettered the target of three medals set by UK Sport. The most successful swimmer was Rebecca Adlington who won two gold medals. Her 400m freestyle success was Britain's first Olympic swimming title since 1988, and the first swimming gold by a British woman since 1960. Her second gold, in the 800m freestyle, meant she also equalled the best performance by a British woman, from any sport, at the summer Olympics and was the best swimming performance by a Briton at the Olympics for 100 years.|$|E

5|$|Believing {{that the}} wings were short and round, Gibbs thought {{the bird was}} not a strong flyer, and {{therefore}} not nomadic (periodically moving from place to place). In spite of the evidently longer wings which might have made it a strong flyer, vanGrouw also thought {{it would have been}} a sedentary (mostly staying at the same location) bird, that preferred not to fly across <b>open</b> <b>water,</b> similar to species in Ducula. It may have had a limited distribution on a small, remote island, which may explain why its provenance remains unknown.|$|E

5|$|Chapman's {{archipelago}} frigates provided better {{protection for}} their crew than the galleys they replaced, {{and up to}} three times the capacity for stores and provisions. They could operate in the narrow, shallow waters around skerries in all weathers and in <b>open</b> <b>water</b> {{in all but the}} worst storms. They had a deeper draft than galleys, but considerably shallower draft than traditional sailing warships. The new ship types also increased the archipelago fleet's firepower, provided it with better defensive capabilities, and made possible more efficient fire support in amphibious operations.|$|E
5|$|Deep {{convection}} reformed the storm's center {{southwest of}} Haiti, near Jamaica's east coast. Under {{the influence of}} a mid-level ridge that extended from the Gulf of Mexico to the western Atlantic Ocean, Gustav picked up a westward motion. It was briefly disrupted by Jamaica as it passed over the mountainous island but rapidly strengthened when it moved over <b>open</b> <b>water</b> once again. Reaching Category4 strength less than 24 hours after having been a tropical storm, Gustav brushed the Isle of Youth and made landfall on Cuba's western's peninsula.|$|E
