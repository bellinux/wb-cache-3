5|$|The {{product is}} {{regulated}} in different manners in various regions. In the US, {{the product is}} allowed {{to be used in}} ground beef, and it can be used in other meat products such as beef-based processed meats. The use of ammonia as an anti-microbial agent is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and is included on the FDA's list of GRAS (generally recognized as safe) procedures, and is used in similar applications for numerous <b>other</b> <b>food</b> <b>products,</b> including puddings and baked goods. The product is banned in Canada due to the presence of ammonia in it, and it is banned for human consumption in the European Union. Some consumer advocacy groups have promoted the elimination of the product or for mandatory disclosure of additives in beef, while others have expressed concerns about plant closures that occurred after the product received significant news media coverage.|$|E
25|$|Another {{way that}} feminist veganism relates to feminist {{thoughts}} {{is through the}} capitalist means of the production itself. Carol J. Adams, mentions Barbara Noske talking about “meat eating as the ultimate capitalist product, because it takes so much to make the product, it uses up so many resources”. The capitalization of resources for meat production is argued to be better used for production of <b>other</b> <b>food</b> <b>products</b> that have a less detrimental impact on the environment.|$|E

25|$|With time, the {{shortage}} economy led to scarcity of meat, coffee, tea and other ingredients of daily use. Many products like chocolate, sugar and meat were rationed, {{with a specific}} limit depending on social class and health requirements. Physical workers and pregnant women were generally entitled to more food products. Imports were restricted, {{so much of the}} food supply was domestic. Cuisine became homogeneous, to be a chef was no longer a prestigious profession and for decades the country became basically disconnected from any foreign cuisine. Tropical fruits (citrus, banana, pineapple, etc.) were available during holidays and local fruits and vegetables were mostly seasonal but were available at private stands. For most of the year the Poles had to get by with only domestic winter fruit and vegetables: apples, plums, currants, onions, potatoes, cabbage, root vegetables and frozen products. <b>Other</b> <b>food</b> <b>products</b> (of foreign origins) were available at markets at high prices.|$|E

2500|$|As {{consumers}} and farmers grew increasingly vocal in their unhappiness over the situation, Thomas P. Revelle, a Seattle city councilman, lawyer, and newspaper editor, took advantage the precedent of an 1896 Seattle city ordinance {{that allowed the}} city to designate tracts of land as public markets. The area of Western Avenue above the Elliott Bay tideflats and {{the area of the}} commission food houses had just been turned into a wooden planked road, called Pike Place, off of Pike Street and First Avenue. Through a city council ordinance vote on August 5, 1907, he had part of Pike Place designated temporarily as a public market for the [...] "sales of garden, farm and <b>other</b> <b>food</b> <b>products</b> from wagons...".|$|E
2500|$|Each night, 6000 wagons {{converged on}} Les Halles, {{carrying}} meat, seafood, produce, milk, eggs and <b>other</b> <b>food</b> <b>products</b> {{from the train}} stations. The wagons were unloaded by 481 men wearing large hats called les forts (the strong), who carried the food in baskets to the pavilions. Pavilion no. 3 was the hall for meat; no. 9 for seafood; no. 11 for birds and game. [...] Merchants in the pavilions rented their stalls for between one and three francs a day. During the night, fruits and vegetables also arrived at night by carts from farms and gardens around Paris; the farmers rented small spaces of one by two meters on the sidewalk outside the pavilions to sell their produce. The meat was carved, the produce put out on the counters, and the sellers, called [...] "counter criers", were in place by 5 AM, when the market opened.|$|E
2500|$|Wine was {{the third}} {{essential}} part of the Parisian diet. [...] The daily alcohol consumption of the Paris working class was high; [...] in times of economic difficulty, the consumption of <b>other</b> <b>food</b> <b>products</b> decreased, but the consumption of wine increased; it was consumed to relieve stress and to forget difficulties. [...] Low-quality and inexpensive wines were made a vineyards just outside the city. [...] The best quality wines were brought by wine merchants from the chateaux of Burgundy and Bordeaux. [...] By far the largest quantity of wine arrived by boat at the Halle aux Vins, which was located on the quai des Bernardins between rue Cuvier and Place Maubert, next to the Jardin des Plantes. The Halle aux Vins had been started in 1808 and finished in 1818; [...] it occupied fourteen hectares, and had 159 wine cellars at street level and another forty-nine caves underground. All bulk wine, spirits, oils and vinegars were required to pass through the Halle, where the alcohol level was measured and taxes were collected; [...] wine and spirits with more than eighteen percent alcohol paid a higher tax.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Capillary {{electrophoresis}} (CE) with capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection (C 4 D) {{was used}} for determination of sodium and potassium concentrations in diet and non-diet soft drinks.

2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Hollaback Girl" [...] was {{directed}} by Paul Hunter and filmed in the Van Nuys and Reseda neighborhoods of Los Angeles, California. The video opens with a scene of Stefani spending time with her Harajuku Girls, when a crowd of students appears. Stefani and the Harajuku Girls then drive down Sherman Way past Magnolia Science Academy to Birmingham High School in a 1961 Chevrolet Impala, accompanied by the crowd. Stefani and the group cause a commotion when they disrupt a football game by walking onto the field and {{when they go to}} a 99 Cents Only Store and throw cereal and <b>other</b> <b>food</b> <b>products</b> down an aisle. Throughout the video, there are intercut sequences of choreographed dancing filmed in a sound stage, intended to represent Stefani's imagination.
