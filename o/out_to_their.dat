Immediately, Gandalf rode <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> aid, temporarily banishing the Nazgûl.|$|E
5|$|As the {{deadline}} passed on April 2, Melkonian's armor entered the intersection and encountered {{a line of}} Azeri tanks and infantry. A firefight ensued but lasted for only several minutes as the defense line was soon battered and destroyed. Many of the Azeri forces were ill-prepared for the attack as Melkonian noted when pointing <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> lack of equipment. Despite having his force reduced down {{to a total of}} sixty-eight men, a force too weak to take the capital, he ordered them to continue forward.|$|E
5|$|President Arthur {{departed}} Haifa on April 4 for a ten-day excursion in the Mediterranean, calling at Jaffa, Beirut, Alexandria, and Naples, among others, before sailing for the United States from Haifa on April 17. While docked at Naples on April 23, crewmen from President Arthur {{got into}} a confrontation {{with members of the}} Blackshirts, the Italian fascist paramilitary group. Five of the Blackshirts had broken noses and black eyes; five American seamen were arrested and a further 15 Americans swam <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> steamer to avoid arrest. After calling at Halifax, the liner docked at Pier 86 in New York on March 8, carrying among its cargo 75,000bags of onions from Alexandria, 16,000cases of lemons from Palermo, and two cases of Jaffa oranges for Nathan Straus. Only 500well-wishers greeted the ship, arriving as it did on the Jewish sabbath, but President Arthur was greeted by the largest police detail in many years because of rumors of a mutiny on board the ship. Sources are unclear as to what actually happened aboard the ship, but it is known that virtually the entire crew, including the captain, was replaced before the next voyage.|$|E

25|$|South Korea's still {{continuing}} traditionalist beliefs {{result in}} few people being open about their homosexuality. Homosexuality is discouraged, although homosexuality is legal in South Korea. As a result, {{there are few}} if any legal protections in place for gays and lesbians, {{and many of them}} are afraid to come <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> families, friends, and co-workers. Gay men are not allowed to serve in the military, and in 2005 five soldiers were discharged for homosexuality.|$|E
25|$|In late 1879 one of Wyatt Earp's prized horses named Dick Naylor was stolen. Almost a {{year later}} he got a tip that it had been seen at the Clanton ranch near Charleston. Earp rode <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> ranch and spotted the horse. Ike Clanton and his brother Billy were both present. Earp {{returned}} with Holliday to recover the horse. On the way, they overtook Behan, who was riding in a wagon. Behan was also heading to the ranch to serve an election-hearing subpoena on Ike Clanton.|$|E

There, {{they are allowed to}} throw the ball <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> teammates provided that the ball touches the ground before the half court mark. When they are completely outside the box, goalkeepers are considered field players and are not allowed to touch the ball with their hands.|$|E

25|$|The TA's AA {{units were}} mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis. The {{call-out}} of key parties by telephone and telegram went well, and they assembled at their drill halls {{within a few}} hours. Because the units possessed only a small scale of transport, elaborate plans {{had been made to}} requisition civilian vehicles, ranging from heavy lorries to buses and private cars. Equipment was drawn from mobilisation stores, and the detachments ferried <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> war stations. Despite some failures and problems, the emergency positions covering London were manned and most of the equipment was in place within 24 hours. The emergency mobilisation lasted nearly three weeks before the TA units were released on 14 October.|$|E
25|$|The first {{farmers of}} Stratford {{resided in the}} village and went <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> farms, located one to three miles away, to do the work of the farm. The Nichols and White Plains areas were the first to be {{cultivated}} and settled within the present-day bounds of Trumbull, due to the fertile soil, spring-fed ponds and natural meadows found there and their proximity to the main village located less than three miles away. In the mid-seventeenth century in the Colony of Connecticut, it was very common for freemen to establish a farm or several farms in the fertile upland or countryside while maintaining a substantial townhouse in the village or even back in England.|$|E
25|$|Another {{complication}} {{can occur}} in case of incomplete or erroneous regeneration of the damaged facial nerve. The nerve {{can be thought of}} as a bundle of smaller individual nerve connections that branch <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> proper destinations. During regrowth, nerves are generally able to track the original path to the right destination - but some nerves may sidetrack leading to a condition known as synkinesis. For instance, regrowth of nerves controlling muscles attached to the eye may sidetrack and also regrow connections reaching the muscles of the mouth. In this way, movement of one also affects the other. For example, when the person closes the eye, the corner of the mouth lifts involuntarily.|$|E

25|$|In {{the period}} between 2000 and 2007, the Rupee stopped declining and {{stabilized}} ranging between 1 USD = INR 44–48. In late 2007, the Indian Rupee reached a record high of Rs.39 per USD, on account of sustained foreign investment flows into the country. This posed problems for major exporters, IT and BPO firms located {{in the country who}} were incurring losses in their earnings given the appreciation in rupee. The trend has reversed lately with the 2008 world financial crisis as Foreign investors transferred huge sums <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own countries. Such appreciations were reflected in many currencies, e.g. the British Pound, which had gained value against the dollar and then has lost value again with the recession of 2008.|$|E
25|$|The TA's AA {{units were}} mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis. The staff of 1st AA Division {{now had to}} {{implement}} the Tompson Committee's plan. The call-out of key parties by telephone and telegram went well, and they assembled at their drill halls within a few hours. Because the units possessed only a small scale of transport, elaborate plans {{had been made to}} requisition civilian vehicles, ranging from heavy lorries to buses and private cars.

Despite some failures and problems, the emergency positions covering London were manned and most of the equipment was in place within 24 hours. The emergency mobilisation lasted nearly three weeks before the TA units were released on 14 October. The experience brought about improvements in equipment scales, and a rapid expansion of AA defences brought many new AA gun and searchlight units into existence, some by conversion of TA infantry battalions.|$|E
25|$|For the {{farewell}} season, {{the best}} friends hit the road again for an overnight camping trip at Yosemite National Park. Park ranger Shelton Johnson wrote to Winfrey because he was concerned by the low number of African-Americans who visited the national parks each year. So Winfrey and King packed up their camper and headed to Yosemite to help Johnson attract visitors. When they arrived, Johnson took Winfrey and King around the park {{to see some of}} its famous sites including Mariposa Grove and the Tunnel View, where El Capitan is visible in the distance. On the way to the campsite, Winfrey made a sharp turn causing their trailer to hit a rock. After setting up their pop-up camper, the two mixed up some Moscow Mules to pass <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> camping neighbors. The drink has become a signature Oprah cocktail. The next day they took a lesson in fly fishing and wrapped up their stay with a mule ride.|$|E

500|$|The Workshop devoted 8% {{of their}} initial budget to {{advertise}} the new show. [...] In what Morrow called [...] "an extensive campaign" [...] that Lesser stated [...] "would demand {{at least as}} much ingenuity as production and research", they promoted the show with educators and the broadcast industry. [...] The Workshop understood that a special effort had to be made to reach their target community because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups. To get the word <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> target audience in the inner cities, they hired Evelyn Davis from the Urban League, whom Michael Davis called [...] "remarkable, unsinkable, and indispensable", as the Workshop's first Vice President of Community Relations and head of the Workshop's Community Educational Services (CES) division.|$|E
500|$|Dick Irvin once {{compared}} the styles of Syl Apps, previous {{captain of the}} Leafs, to Kennedy in how the two centres used their wingers. [...] "Apps used to hit the defense at top speed and Gordie Drillon would come along {{and pick up the}} garbage", said Irvin, whereas Kennedy would [...] "go into the corners and get the puck <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> wings." [...] Hap Day had said he could see Nels Stewart's influence on Kennedy. Like Stewart, Kennedy had a more upright lie on his hockey stick which kept the puck closer to his feet. Kennedy was also widely believed to be the best faceoff man in hockey and seldom lost an important faceoff. Along with his regular shift, he also played a role on the penalty kill.|$|E

[...] Breathe Carolina's act consisted of a balance of pop punk and rock music, which stood <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> record label, Fearless Records. Because of it, Fearless Records decided to reserve a spot for them on their upcoming compilation Punk Goes Pop 2 (2009), where they performed a cover version of [...] "See You Again", produced by Mike Green.

[...] At her concert in Italy Madonna made an emotional tribute for the deceased technicians by saying: [...] "I just wanted to take a moment to acknowledge and pay tribute to two people who lost their lives today, [...] It's a great tragedy to me, I feel so devastated to be in any way associated with anyone's suffering.

500|$|When the {{instrumentation}} was completed, Draiman {{began to}} write melody lines for each song. Draiman commented, [...] "I'm {{a big believer in}} the vibe of the music and the feel of it, how the song makes you feel musically should dictate {{what it is to be}} about and so if you start with something that has meaning, but the music doesn't support the meaning, then what good is it?" [...] The first song completed musically was [...] "The Night", and Draiman completed the melody line in three days. This caused Draiman to tentatively call the record The Night. As Draiman recalled, [...] "The instrumentation was so cool and so dark and textural that I right away kind of jumped into it." [...] When the first batch of songs were completed, the band sent them <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> record label, Reprise Records, and waited for their approval to continue writing more songs. After they received approval, they wrote the rest of the songs featured on the album.|$|E
