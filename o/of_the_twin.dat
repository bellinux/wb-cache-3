5|$|Ernest 'Melville' Guest {{was born}} in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, in May 1920, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twin</b> sons of Ernest Lucas Guest, a {{prominent}} Rhodesian politician. Before {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, he was nominated by the Governor of Southern Rhodesia to be a Royal Air Force cadet at RAF College, Cranwell. He was granted a permanent commission as Pilot Officer in the General Duties Branch on 9 October 1939.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Charles MacNaughton, {{minister}} of the Department of Highways, announced plans for the Lakehead Expressway to be built on the western edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twin</b> cities of Port Arthur and Fort William (which amalgamated in 1970 to form Thunder Bay).|$|E
5|$|M-63 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan that runs from M-139 at Scottdale through the cities of Benton Harbor and St. Joseph to Interstate 196/US Highway 31 (I-196/US31) at exit7 just outside Hagar Shores. The trunkline runs through residential areas south of St. Joseph and through the central business districts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twin</b> cities. Further north, M-63 runs along the Lake Michigan shoreline.|$|E

50|$|Another {{hypothesis}} {{is that there is}} joining <b>of</b> <b>the</b> somatic and placental vascular system <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twins,</b> as well as a degeneration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> umbilical cord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parasitic <b>twin.</b> This suggests that craniopagus parasiticus develops due to <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> blood supply to one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twins.</b>|$|R

5|$|The 9/11 attacks had {{immediate}} {{effects on}} the American people. Police and rescue workers {{from around the country}} took leaves of absence, traveling to New York City to help recover bodies from the twisted remnants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> Towers. Blood donations across the U.S. surged in the weeks after 9/11.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) {{investigated}} the collapses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> Towers and 7WTC. The investigations examined why the buildings collapsed and what fire protection measures were in place, and evaluated how {{fire protection systems}} might be improved in future construction. The investigation into the collapse of 1WTC and 2WTC was concluded in October 2005 and that of 7WTC was completed in August 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Victorian art critic, {{author and}} social critic John Ruskin lived at 163 Denmark Hill from 1842 to 1871. The house no longer stands {{and is now}} the site of a block of council flats.

5|$|During the Great Depression, {{another large}} public works project {{involved}} the pass. The federal Works Progress Administration (WPA) oversaw the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> Lakes Tunnel, which diverted water from Grizzly Reservoir, on Lincoln Creek, a southern {{tributary of the}} Roaring Fork, to Twin Lakes, where it was used for irrigation purposes by beet and watermelon farmers in the Rocky Ford and Ordway areas. Starting in 1935, 50,000 acre-feet (about 61.7 million m³) were made available this way.|$|E
5|$|High water {{volume in}} wet seasons {{does most of}} the downcutting in the main canyon. These flood events are {{responsible}} for transporting most of the 3millionshorttons (2.7millionmetrictons) of rock and sediment that the Virgin River transports yearly. The Virgin cuts away its canyon faster than its tributaries can cut away their own streambeds, so tributaries end in waterfalls from hanging valleys where they meet the Virgin. The valley between the peaks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> Brothers is a notable example of a hanging valley in the canyon.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{thousands}} of tons of toxic debris containing more than 2,500 contaminants, including known carcinogens, were spread across Lower Manhattan due to the collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> Towers. Exposure to the toxins in the debris is alleged to have contributed to fatal or debilitating illnesses among people who were at ground zero. The Bush administration ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue reassuring statements regarding air quality {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks, citing national security, but the EPA did not determine that air quality had returned to pre-September 11 levels until June 2002.|$|E

5|$|In Allegan County, I-196/US31 {{passes a}} pair of golf courses and {{continues}} northward through farm fields. Near the community of Glenn, A-2 crosses over the freeway and runs parallel to it on the east. The two roads trade places again when I-196/US31 turns northeasterly {{on the south side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twin</b> cities of Saugatuck and Douglas. The freeway crosses over a section of Kalamazoo Lake, a wider section of the Kalamazoo River that flows between the two towns. A-2 crosses back to {{the eastern side of the}} freeway north of Saugatuck, and I-196/US31 continues north-northeasterly toward Holland.|$|E
5|$|In rural eastern McLeod County, MN7 jogs to {{the north}} around Silver Lake {{in the city of}} the same name. Northeast of Lester Prairie, the highway crosses into Carver County. This area is also rural farm country as the roadway {{bypasses}} New Germany and Mayer {{to the north}}. Near the latter community, MN7 intersects MN25 which provides a connection to both Mayer and the city of Watertown. North of Waconia, the roadway begins to meander southeasterly through an area dotted with several lakes and crosses into the western edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> Cities metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Christmas Nights follows Elliot and Claris {{during the holiday}} season {{following}} their adventures with Nights. Though they both enjoy the Christmas season, they feel as if something is missing. Realising that the Christmas Star that usually sits at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> Seeds Christmas tree is absent, the pair travel to Nightopia to find it. There, they reunite with Nights and re-explore Spring Valley, which has now been decorated due to their dreams of the holiday season. The remainder of the story revolves around their attempts of defeating a revived Gillwing and retrieving the Christmas Star from his lair.|$|E

5|$|The {{western edge}} of St. Louis Park is marked by the {{interchange}} with US169. The area immediately adjacent to MN7 in this suburb is filled with commercial properties {{on either side of}} access roads. East of Louisiana Avenue, the highway is parallel to a line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> Cities and Western Railroad. There is another interchange for Wooddale Avenue before MN7 meets, and terminates at, the interchange for MN100 near the Peavey–Haglin Experimental Concrete Grain Elevator, the country's first concrete grain elevator. The expressway continues east for approximately another mile (1.6km) as CR25.|$|E
5|$|At 8:32a.m., FAA {{officials}} were notified Flight 11 had been hijacked and {{they in turn}} notified the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). NORAD scrambled two F-15s from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts and they were airborne by 8:53a.m. Because of slow and confused communication from FAA officials, NORAD had 9minutes' notice that Flight 11 had been hijacked, and no notice {{about any of the}} other flights before they crashed. After both <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> Towers had already been hit, more fighters were scrambled from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia at 9:30a.m. At 10:20a.m. Vice President Dick Cheney issued orders to shoot down any commercial aircraft that could be positively identified as being hijacked. These instructions were not relayed in time for the fighters to take action. Some fighters took to the air without live ammunition, knowing that to prevent the hijackers from striking their intended targets, the pilots might have to intercept and crash their fighters into the hijacked planes, possibly ejecting at the last moment.|$|E
5|$|At the north-west {{corner of}} the walls stands Arundel tower, another large drum tower that {{originally}} overlooked a small cliff. South of this is Catchcold tower. Catchcold tower {{was designed to be}} defended with guns and has three gunports; the need to support cannon leaves it much heavier in appearance than the other circular towers on the walls. The remains of machine gun mountings fitted to the tower in 1941 can still be seen. The Arcades form part of the surviving west walls and are a unique feature in England; their closest architectural equivalent are in Rouen, France. The West Gate still stands three storeys high and was originally defended by two portcullises; the windows {{on the west side of}} the gate are the original medieval designs. Along the south side of the walls one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twin</b> towers protecting the South Gate still stands, largely intact.|$|E

5|$|Early {{plans for}} the Interstate Highway System include a route along roughly the same {{alignment}} as the present I-35 through the Twin Cities area, but are not detailed enough to show exactly how the cities would be served. When preliminary urban routes were laid out in 1955, a split alignment was chosen to serve both cities equally. South <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> Cities, I-35 followed the corridor of old US65, which had followed Lyndale Avenue between Burnsville and downtown Minneapolis. I-35E was located parallel to MN13, which cut northeast to Saint Paul from old US65 south of the Minnesota River. North of the metropolitan area, I-35 closely paralleled US61, which passed through Saint Paul; I-35W paralleled old US8 from Minneapolis northeast through New Brighton {{and then to the}} present day I-35E–I-35W split at Columbus near Forest Lake, near where old US8 had joined US61. The Minnesota Legislature defined I-35E as part of unmarked Legislative Route390, which stretched south to the Iowa state line and north to the city of Duluth along I-35.|$|E
5|$|Free agent pitcher Mike Mussina {{signed with}} the Yankees before their 2001 season began, and the club {{pulled away from the}} Red Sox as the year progressed to claim another divisional championship, as Clemens won 20 games. The September 11 attacks {{interrupted}} the season, and the resumption of baseball in New York became a symbol of how the city recovered from the destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> Towers. After falling behind 2–0 in the ALDS against the Athletics, the Yankees won three straight contests to advance to the ALCS. They prevailed in five games against the Seattle Mariners, who had tied a single-season MLB record with 116 regular season wins, for the team's fourth straight AL pennant. The Arizona Diamondbacks gained a two-game lead in the 2001 World Series before the Yankees won three consecutive ballgames; New York home runs with two outs in the ninth inning of Games 4 and 5 led to extra inning wins in both games, with Game 4 ended by a Jeter home run. The Yankees' championship streak ended, though, as the Diamondbacks won the Series in seven games with a late rally in the final inning of Game 7.|$|E
5|$|M-63 {{begins at}} the {{intersection}} of Niles, Scottdale and Miners roads southwest of St. Joseph in Royalton Township. M-139 runs on Niles Road northwest from Berrien Springs to this point and on Scottdale Road north of the intersection. M-63 follows Miners Road west and then Niles Road northwest of the junction, parallel to the St. Joseph River through residential areas on the outskirts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twin</b> cities. The highway meets Interstate 94 (I-94) at the latter's exit27 and continues through St. Joseph Township to the city of St. Joseph. In the city, after Washington Avenue, Niles Road becomes Niles Avenue and turns north. As part of its maintenance duties, the MDOT tracks traffic volumes on the state highways in a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a calculation of the average traffic level for any day of a year. The roadway segment along Niles Avenue north of the Napier Avenue intersection in 2009 had the highest traffic levels along all of M-63 at 22,263vehicles.|$|E
