5|$|Another {{option is}} to {{classify}} selection by the life cycle stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability <b>of</b> <b>survival,</b> and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability <b>of</b> <b>survival</b> before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.|$|E

5|$|Treatment for {{antifreeze}} poisoning {{needs to}} be started as soon after ingestion as possible to be effective; the earlier treatment is started, the greater the chance <b>of</b> <b>survival.</b> Cats must be treated within 3 hours of ingesting of antifreeze to be effective, while dogs must be treated within 8–12 hours of ingestion. Once kidney failure develops, the prognosis is poor.|$|E

5|$|Chemotherapy may be {{combined}} with palliative care {{in the treatment of}} the NSCLC.

The NSCLC Meta-Analyses Collaborative Group recommends if the recipient wants and can tolerate treatment, then chemotherapy should be considered in advanced NSCLC.|$|E
5|$|Don't Starve was Klei's {{first foray}} into the {{survival}} genre.

The game received positive reviews from critics; commended for its original art style, music, and variety of ways for the player to die, although its high level of difficulty and implementation of permanent death were less warmly received.|$|E
5|$|Gladiators {{were trained}} combatants {{who might be}} slaves, convicts, or free volunteers.

By contrast, noxii were convicts sentenced to the arena {{with little or no}} training, often unarmed, and with no expectation <b>of</b> <b>survival.</b> Physical suffering and humiliation were considered appropriate retributive justice for the crimes they had committed. These executions were sometimes staged or ritualized as re-enactments of myths, and amphitheatres were equipped with elaborate stage machinery to create special effects. Tertullian considered deaths in the arena to be nothing more than a dressed-up form of human sacrifice.|$|E
