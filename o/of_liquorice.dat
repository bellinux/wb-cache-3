5|$|At the Rio de Janeiro location, {{many months}} later, Roger Moore arrived {{several days later}} than {{scheduled}} for shooting due to recurrent health problems and an attack of kidney stones that he had suffered while in France. After arriving in Rio de Janeiro, Moore was immediately whisked off the plane and went straight to hair and make-up work, before re-boarding the plane, to film the sequence with him arriving as James Bond in the film. Sugarloaf Mountain was a prominent location in the film, and during filming of the cable car sequence in which Bond and Goodhead are attacked by Jaws during mid-air transportation high above Rio de Janeiro, the stuntman Richard Graydon slipped and narrowly avoided falling to his death. For the scene in which Jaws bites into the steel tramway cable with his teeth, the cable was actually made <b>of</b> <b>liquorice,</b> although Richard Kiel was still required to use his steel dentures.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, burning {{performance}} <b>of</b> <b>liquorices</b> {{was tested}} by cone calorimeter. The {{results indicated that}} liquorices were easily to be ignited, the minimum ignition heat flux intensity theoretically can be speculated at 5. 8822 kW • m- 2;during the early time of the ignition <b>of</b> <b>liquorices,</b> in view <b>of</b> the thick carbonized layer formed {{on the surface of}} samples, which delayed the pyrolysis <b>of</b> <b>liquorices,</b> the peak heat release rate was greater under lower heat flux than other conditions, and the average heat release rate increased with the growth of heat flux; during the early time of the ignition <b>of</b> <b>liquorices,</b> specific extinction area and CO yield was higher; with the increase of heat flux, specific extinction area and CO yield decreased. Hence, the fire risk <b>of</b> <b>liquorices</b> can’t be ignored...|$|R

25|$|Liquorice flavour {{is found}} {{in a wide variety}} of candies or sweets. In most of these candies, the taste is {{reinforced}} by aniseed oil so the actual content <b>of</b> <b>liquorice</b> is very low. Liquorice confections are primarily purchased by consumers in the European Union.|$|E
25|$|The scent <b>of</b> <b>liquorice</b> root {{comes from}} a complex and {{variable}} combination of compounds, of which anethole is up to 3% of total volatiles. Much of the sweetness in liquorice comes from glycyrrhizin, which has a sweet taste, 30–50 times the sweetness of sugar. The sweetness {{is very different from}} sugar, being less instant, tart, and lasting longer.|$|E

2500|$|The United States Food and Drug Administration {{believes}} that foods containing liquorice and its derivatives (including glycyrrhizin) are safe if not consumed excessively.

2500|$|Most {{liquorice}} {{is used as}} a {{flavouring agent}} for tobacco. For example, M Worldwide reported in 2011 that about 63% of its liquorice product sales are to the worldwide tobacco industry for use as tobacco flavour enhancing and moistening agents in the manufacture of American blend cigarettes, moist snuff, chewing tobacco, and pipe tobacco. [...] American blend cigarettes made up a larger portion of worldwide tobacco consumption in earlier years, and the percentage <b>of</b> <b>liquorice</b> products used by the tobacco industry was higher in the past. M Worldwide sold approximately 73% of its liquorice products to the tobacco industry in 2005. A consultant to M Worldwide's predecessor company stated in 1975 that it was believed that well over 90% of the total production <b>of</b> <b>liquorice</b> extract and its derivatives found its way into tobacco products.|$|E
2500|$|Liquorice {{provides}} {{tobacco products}} {{with a natural}} sweetness and a distinctive flavour that blends readily with the natural and imitation flavouring components employed in the tobacco industry. It represses harshness and is not detectable as liquorice by the consumer. [...] Tobacco flavourings such as liquorice also {{make it easier to}} inhale the smoke by creating bronchodilators, which open up the lungs. [...] Chewing tobacco requires substantially higher levels <b>of</b> <b>liquorice</b> extract as emphasis on the sweet flavour appears highly desirable.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{liquorice}} {{is used as}} a {{flavouring agent}} for tobacco, particularly US blend cigarettes, to which liquorice lends a natural sweetness and a distinctive flavour and makes it easier to inhale the smoke by creating bronchodilators, which open up the lungs. [...] Liquorice flavours are also used as candies or sweeteners, particularly in some European and Middle Eastern countries. Liquorice extracts have a number of medical uses, and they are also used in herbal and folk medications. Excessive consumption <b>of</b> <b>liquorice</b> (more than 2mg/kg/day of pure glycyrrhizinic acid, a liquorice component) may result in adverse effects, and overconsumption should be suspected clinically in patients presenting with otherwise unexplained hypokalemia and muscle weakness.|$|E
2500|$|There are two (private) bridges {{that connect}} the Cadbury's works {{on either side}} of the Don. However, there is a (public) {{footpath}} along the northern bank of the Don (this will probably eventually form part of the planned Upper Don Walk) which goes under the two bridges. The Cadbury's (previously Bassett's) works is one of the major employers in the area. The George Bassett & Co. Ltd sweet factory is one of the longest serving of local firms, made world-famous by the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>Liquorice</b> Allsorts. The firm was established in Sheffield in 1842 but did not come to Hillsborough (Owlerton) until 1934 when Bassett's son-in-law Samuel Meggit Johnson built a large factory on Beulah Road (on the south side of the Don). The factory was enlarged in the inter-war period as new products such as Jelly Babies, Wine Gums and Liquorice Novelties were added to the range.|$|E
