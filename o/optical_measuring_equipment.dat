40|$|Development of {{microelectronics}} requires {{solution of}} the problem ensuring unity of linear measurements in a submicron range. The problem can be solved {{on the condition that}} calibration of measuring devices shall be made in accordance with reference samples that is a short length scale. While making calibration of <b>measuring</b> <b>equipment</b> {{with the help of a}} reference measure it is important to investigate components of the method accuracy and their influence on measuring results. The paper considers methodical errors which are specific for methods of optical and atomic force microscopy. Calibration results of an <b>optical</b> <b>measuring</b> microscope are given in the paper. The paper reveals that an additive error depends on parameters of a material and the form of measured elements for an <b>optical</b> <b>measuring</b> microscope. The methodical error of atomic force microscopes is predicated on the probe point shape. The paper considers a short length scale used for calibration of optical and atomic force microscopes.

40|$|For the {{determination}} of the solar absorptance s and the thermal emittance preferably optical methods are utilized. To these methods belong spectral reflectance αs and ε measurements and / or emission measurements (only ε), whereby for αs must be measured in the common range 0, 3 µm to 2, 5 µm and in the range 5 µm to 35 µm with an essentially better resolution than 10 nm. Besides so-called integrated reflectance measurements are known, for which special detectors are used, in the above indicated spectral ranges. These <b>optical</b> <b>measuring</b> procedures are relatively exact. They deliver also information about a perhaps spectral selective behaviour of surfaces, however, special <b>measuring</b> <b>equipment</b> is required. The known thermal (or calorimetrical) methods [1] require, that the test surfaces are in the thermal balance with their environment and at least for the s determination a suited solar simulator is required with high constance of the irradiation intensity during the entire measuring phase. Since these measuring phases up to the reaching of the thermal equilibrium are very long, this is...|$|R
40|$|For the {{determination}} of the solar absorptance αs and ε the thermal emittance optical methods are preferred. These <b>optical</b> <b>measuring</b> procedures are relatively exact. They also deliver information about any potential spectral selective behaviour of surfaces. However, special <b>measuring</b> <b>equipment</b> is required. Particularly if space simulation facilities are already available, the method presented in [1] appears as a suitable enrichment of the measurement methods for {{the determination}} of the thermooptical properties αs and ε. It is possible with slight technical expense to expand the usage potential of such facilities. For this paper the same test rig as in [1] is used. In a common space simulation chamber (vacuum; cryogenic shroud; solar simulator) a test item (target) is arranged. In different measuring phases the target is heated up by an integrated electrical heater or by solar irradiation. The arrangement (target / shroud) is regarded as a two node model. Its (integrated) nodal equation describes the behaviour T(t) of the target. A proper Kalman filter-algorithm can estimate the parameters for the hea...|$|R
