5|$|Locating prey: The wolves {{travel in}} search of prey through their power of scent, chance encounter, and tracking. Wolves {{typically}} locate their prey by scent, though they must usually be directly downwind <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> a breeze carrying the prey's scent is located, the wolves stand alert, and point their eyes, ears and nose towards their target. In open areas, wolves may precede the hunt with group ceremonies involving standing nose-to-nose and wagging their tails. Once concluded, the wolves head towards their prey.|$|E
5|$|Walter sets up his {{equipment}} {{on the frozen}} ice of Reiden Lake, near a cabin where Elizabeth and Peter are staying; Walter theorizes the frozen waters will buffer {{the effects of the}} crossing. Carla arrives with Nina, and both try to talk him out <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> Walter realizes William is not with them, he takes this as an implicit sign of William's consent to his plan, and activates the portal. Nina attempts to tackle Walter as he steps through, but instead part of her arm disappears in the portal as it closes; Carla rushes her to the hospital.|$|E
5|$|During the pouring rain, a {{young boy}} helps {{his mother and father}} leave a heavily chained toy box at the {{doorstep}} of Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends with instructions to not be opened. The next day, Frankie has grown outraged about her job as the house caretaker; Mr. Herriman has been giving her endless chores to take care day after day without thanking her for any <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> Frankie discovers the box left on the doorstep, Herriman instructs her to leave it in the attic. In a fit of anger toward Herriman, she intentionally ignores the instructions given in the box and peeks inside it. She falls inside, only to discover it is a vast world filled with anthropomorphic toys and delectable treats. She hears and sympathizes with {{a young boy}}'s voice (Max Burkholder), later revealed to be the imaginary friend named World (given the name by the crew of the show), who has been living alone in the toy chest since his family left the box at Foster's.|$|E

5|$|In total, 141 {{men have}} held {{the rank of}} field marshal. The {{majority}} led careers in the British Army or the British Indian Army, rising through the ranks to eventually become a field marshal. Some members of the British Royal Family—most recently Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, and Charles, Prince of Wales—were promoted to the rank after shorter periods of service. Three British monarchs—George V, Edward VIII, and George VI— assumed the rank on their accessions to the throne, while Edward VII was already a field marshal, and two British consorts—Albert, Prince Consort and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh—were appointed by their respective queens. Other ceremonial appointments were made as diplomatic gestures. Twelve foreign monarchs held the honour, though three (Wilhelm II, German Emperor; Franz Joseph I, Austrian Emperor; and Hirohito, Emperor of Japan) were stripped <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> their countries became enemies of Britain and her allies in the two world wars. Also awarded the rank were two distinguished foreign military officers, honoured for their contributions to World War I and World War II respectively, and one foreign statesman.|$|E
5|$|The episode makes {{references}} to Family Guy itself. When Bonnie, Lois and Cleveland's new girlfriend come to dance at The Drunken Clam, they state {{that they would}} like to make the bar their place to hang out, after Peter grabs Joe's gun and kills himself. It turns out that this was only Peter's imagination as he snaps out <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> Joe starts talking to him; Peter answers that he was having a Scrubs fantasy moment. Quagmire responds to Peter's moment by stating that Scrubs is the best show people are not watching. Cleveland replies that he hates shows that leave the story for a gag or joke, referring to the numerous cutaways Scrubs and Family Guy contain. While in the hospital Peter realizes that Mr. Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman have a similar voice, then Mr. Pewterschmidt comes into the room and they both start talking about how their voices sound alike; this is a reference to the show's creator Seth MacFarlane as he voices both characters.|$|E

25|$|While Franck and Hertz {{were unaware}} <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> they {{published}} their experiments in 1914, in 1913 Niels Bohr had published {{a model for}} atoms that was very successful in accounting for the optical properties of atomic hydrogen. These were usually observed in gas discharges, which emitted light at a series of wavelengths. Ordinary light sources like incandescent light bulbs emit light at all wavelengths. Bohr had calculated the wavelengths emitted by hydrogen very accurately.|$|E
25|$|The coroner inquest was {{the first}} {{investigation}} to be completed, occurring shortly after the crash. Its purpose was not to decide absolute culpability, but rather to determine exactly the manner of death of the involved individuals. During the inquest, both surviving Army pilots testified that they had seen the airliner, but that they had subsequently lost sight <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> their aircraft had flown into smoke from a nearby forest fire.|$|E

25|$|Butt {{travelled}} to Paris and undertook {{further studies}} with Jacques Bouhy (the teacher {{of two other}} notable contraltos with international reputations, Louise Homer and Louise Kirkby Lunn). Later she polished her skills in Berlin with the famous retired soprano Etelka Gerster. The French composer Camille Saint-Saëns heard her, and wanted her to study his opera Dalila, {{but at the time}} the representation of biblical subjects on the British stage was forbidden, and nothing came <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> the law changed and the work was given at Covent Garden in 1909 the part of Delila was sung by Lunn, to Butt's disappointment.|$|E
25|$|Angel Beats! {{is set in}} a {{world after}} death, which acts as a limbo where the dead learn to give up any {{lingering}} attachments from life before passing on. Those in this limbo can eat, feel pain, and can even die again, only to awaken later with no injuries. Objects not originally present in this world can be created from dirt depending on the familiarity <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> alive. In the case of weapons, this can range from simple melee weapons to more complex firearms and explosives. In addition, computer programs can be used to create a mixed reality, as when Kanade creates her supernatural powers via a program called Angel Player.|$|E
25|$|In June 1871, {{against the}} wishes of Thiers, the Assembly voted by 472 to 97 to allow exiled members of the Bourbons and Orleans {{families}} to return to France. They were led by Henri, Count of Chambord, {{the heir to the}} Bourbon throne, who declared his willingness to rule France as Henry V. He received considerable support in the beginning, but lost much <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> he declared that he would replace the French tricolor with the white flag of the Bourbons. Thiers protested that {{it was not possible to}} have constitutional monarchy with three different royal dynasties, the Bourbons, the Orleans, and the Bonapartes, all claiming the throne. The republicans in the Assembly, including Leon Gambetta, rallied around Thiers as a defender of the republic.|$|E

25|$|According {{to another}} author, however, {{the idea of}} Hudal's {{intervention}} came from the German ambassador himself, who asked the rector of the Anima to sign {{a letter to the}} military commander of Rome, General Reiner Stahel, requesting that the arrests be halted, otherwise the pope would take a position in public against the arrests and the German occupiers. Ambassador Weizsäcker argued that he had chosen this ruse because Hitler might have reacted against the Vatican and the Pope if it had been the German embassy conveying the warning, instead of the Nazi-friendly bishop. During the war Hudal sheltered victims of the Nazis at Santa Maria dell'Anima, used by the Resistance. Brigadier general John Burns, a New Zealander, gave a description <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> recalling his escape from an Italian POW-camp in 1944.|$|E
25|$|The {{residents}} of Port Royal generally resented {{the military and}} civilian occupiers, who exhibited racist superiority in varying degrees of overtness. Joy—when on April 13, 1862, General David Hunter proclaimed slavery abolished in Georgia, South Carolina, and Alabama—turned to sorrow when on May 12 Union soldiers arrived to draft all able-bodied black men thus liberated. Hunter kept his regiment even after Lincoln reversed this tri-state emancipation proclamation; but disbanded almost all <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> unable to draw payroll from the War Department. Black farmers preferred to grow vegetables and catch fish, whereas the missionaries (and other whites on the islands) encouraged monoculture of cotton as a cash crop. In the thinking of the latter, civilization would be advanced by incorporating blacks into the consumer economy dominated by Northern manufacturing.|$|E
25|$|Morgan was a {{supporter}} of de Vries's mutation theory and was hoping to gather evidence in favor <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> he started working with the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster in his lab in 1907. However, it was a researcher in that lab, Hermann Joseph Muller, who determined in 1918 that the new varieties de Vries had observed while breeding Oenothera {{were the result of}} polyploid hybrids rather than rapid genetic mutation. While they were doubtful of the importance of natural selection, the work of geneticists like Morgan, Bateson, de Vries and others from 1900 to 1915 established Mendelian genetics linked to chromosomal inheritance, which validated August Weismann's criticism of neo-Lamarckian evolution by discounting the inheritance of acquired characteristics. The work in Morgan's lab with Drosophila also undermined the concept of orthogenesis by demonstrating the random nature of mutation.|$|E

25|$|Saladin {{turned his}} {{attention}} from Mosul to Aleppo, sending his brother Taj al-Muluk Buri to capture Tell Khalid, 130km northeast of the city. A siege was set, but the governor of Tell Khalid surrendered upon the arrival of Saladin himself on 17 May before a siege could take place. According to Imad ad-Din, after Tell Khalid, Saladin took a detour northwards to Ain Tab, but he gained possession <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> his army turned towards it, allowing to quickly move backward another c. 100km towards Aleppo. On 21 May, he camped outside the city, positioning himself east of the Citadel of Aleppo, while his forces encircles the suburb of Banaqusa to the northeast and Bab Janan to the west. He stationed his men dangerously close to the city, hoping for an early success.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{extent to}} which the secrecy and {{isolation}} of the wizarding world is maintained varies. Many references are made to the Ministry of Magic performing memory charms to preserve secrecy; however, some Muggles have necessary interactions with the wizarding world. Hermione’s parents are Muggles, but have been seen in Diagon Alley. They are fully aware that magic exists, but they forbade Hermione to use magic to fix her teeth (as dentists, they felt that this was cheating). The Dursleys are also aware of the Wizarding World; Petunia Dursley indicates that she learned <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> her sister, Lily, was accepted for Hogwarts. She shared this information with her husband, who is shown to be contemptuous of the wizarding world even before Harry shows up at their doorstep. There is no indication that Dudley was aware of this until Harry is told about Hogwarts.|$|E
25|$|Once a Tongan has {{obtained}} a hereditary title, be it noble or matāpule, {{he will be}} named with that title and no longer with his baptised name. Such titles are usually for life, but the holder can be stripped <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> convicted of a serious crime, and he will then return to his original name. Some titles are equal to the family name, others are not. For example, when somewhere in history they were given away to another family if the original holder died without sons. In former times a woman could hold such a title, but nowadays only men. To distinguish successive holders of the same title, it is permisseable to add the original name between parenthesis. For example: Fielakepa (Siosaia Aleamotuʻa). No further prefixes such as The, Mr. or Sir are needed in addressing, although in writing often Hon (Honourable) is used. Tongans are still overawed by those of higher rank.|$|E
