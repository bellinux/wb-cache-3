2500|$|Almost {{every major}} college program {{recruited}} Marinovich who, {{as a high}} school freshman, began getting letters from Stanford. Despite the family connections to USC he was uncertain whether he fit the program's offense. After a positive visit, however, Marinovich chose the university over recent national champions BYU and Miami, as well as Arizona State, Stanford, and Washington. Marinovich took his college selection seriously, noting: [...] "This is the biggest decision of my life. It means not only where I will play football, but most likely, who I will marry, who my best friends for life will be, and where I will live. It means everything. And the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> for sure is I'm too young to make this kind of decision by myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after my}} arrival, Gabby flew the first F-86E to arrive on base in {{simulated}} combat {{over the field}} against an F-86A and whipped the other guy badly, with every Sabre jock on the base as witness. After he landed he briefed all pilots and announced that {{the limited number of}} E’s would be reserved for flight leaders. [...] I never forgot his response, when someone asked about the problem of wingmen staying with leaders. [...] He replied “Wingmen are to absorb firepower” and I never knew him well enough to judge whether he had a dry sense of humor, but he made the right choice. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> for sure, Gabby proved himself the greatest at our skills and talents, when he added 6 ½ MIG kills to his 28 victories in WW II and become the all-time American Fighter Ace, and I MIGht [...] add, he did it in the P-47, not the better air-to-air P-51. [...] And he didn’t have a chance to fly the much more powerful F-86F, which arrived after us.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was anxious}} for a moment," [...] Charnock admitted. [...] "But I didn't think he'd go. For <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> he knows Norton doesn't like him." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{even while}} <b>I</b> listened, <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> those sleek malcontents heard too--the Spirit of man in that small voice of his--perplexed, perhaps, and perverted, {{and out of}} tether; but none the less unconquerable and sublime.|$|R
6000|$|Lister hesitated, [...] "For <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> the sum. Then <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> her wages {{were not}} high. You {{ought to see}} I couldn't take the money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> or see: I love you!" [...] he said, passionately, {{and drew}} nearer by a step; but she put {{out her hand}} and {{repelled}} him with a gesture.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't think me rude, in refusing {{your kind}} offer. If there is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> I {{can do better}} than anybody else, that thing is making tea. Do you take sugar and milk, Mr. Roylake?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't {{know about}} that," [...] Matt objected. [...] "Might {{be a lot}} of dog in 'm, for all you can tell. But there's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> sure, an' that there's no gettin' away from." ...|$|E
5000|$|... « Since that day, I {{have often}} {{wondered}} about the woman who saved our lives. Was she the janitor, who had observed the Germans enter but not leave? Was she an office worker somewhere in the building? Or maybe a tenant {{in one of the}} apartments? <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> for sure. She had risked her life to warn Jews of the danger awaiting them. Had she not been there that morning, I would not be here now to tell the story.|$|R
60|$|FIRST GENTLEMAN. There is but <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> against them. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> {{not if you}} know.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] replied Cardatas, curtly. [...] "How should <b>I?</b> But <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> do <b>know,</b> {{and that}} is that I shall lie to until morning, and then we can feel our way near to the coast and see what it does mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One doesn't {{say much}} the morning one pulls out {{to start a}} big job. Anyhow, I'll own it's not my habit. For <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what we're up against," [...] Jim replied. Then he saw Jake's twinkle, and smiled. [...] "My notion is you have been quieter than me." ...|$|E
60|$|England enjoys {{every one}} of these {{advantages}} for enriching a Nation, which I have above enumerated, and into the bargain, a good million returned to them every year without labour or hazard, or one farthing value received on our side. But how long we shall be able to continue the payment, I am not under the least concern. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> that when the hen is starved to death, {{there will be no more}} golden eggs.|$|E
6000|$|Pendragon {{sprang to}} his feet and paced swiftly to and fro across the window, from which the face had {{instantly}} vanished. [...] "I tell you there is nothing in it," [...] he cried, with ringing violence. [...] "There is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> about this matter. You may call me an atheist. I am an atheist." [...] Here he swung round and fixed Father Brown with a face of frightful concentration. [...] "This business is perfectly natural. There is no curse in it at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked so}} undaunted that Charlie {{was a little}} nettled and fired his last shot rather recklessly: [...] "Well, <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> do <b>know</b> you'll never get a husband {{if you go on}} in this absurd way, and by Jove! you need one {{to take care of you}} and keep the {{property}} together!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that. But <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> do <b>know,</b> mamma, {{and that is}} that Prince Beaton isn't the F. F. P. for me. How strange you are, mamma! Don't {{you think it would be}} {{perfectly}} disgusting to accept a person you didn't care for, and let him go on and love you and marry you? It's sickening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before we go any further," [...] he said, [...] "there's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> want to <b>know.</b> How {{is it all}} to be put right again? Suppose {{this room}} is examined? Those strings will show." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aw, come off," [...] he rapped {{back with}} the quick {{imperative}} knuckles I knew so well. [...] "Listen to your uncle talk now. I am Jake Oppenheimer. I always have been Jake Oppenheimer. No other guy is in my makings. What I know I know as Jake Oppenheimer. Now what do I know? I'll tell you <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> kimchi. Kimchi {{is a sort of}} sauerkraut made in a country that used to be called Cho-Sen. The women of Wosan make the best kimchi, and when kimchi is spoiled it stinks to heaven. You keep out of this, Ed. Wait till I tie the professor up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thy {{words are}} ill-suited to a maiden's lips, Swanhild! But of this be sure: I fear thee not, and shall never fear thee. And <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> well that, whether thou or I prevail, {{in the end}} thou shalt harvest the {{greatest}} shame, and in times to come men shall speak of thee with hatred and name thee by ill names. Moreover, Eric shall never love thee; {{from year to year}} he shall hate thee with a deeper hate, though {{it may well be that}} thou wilt bring ruin on him. And now I thank thee that thou hast told me all thy mind, showing me what indeed thou art!" [...] And Gudruda turned scornfully upon her heel and walked away.|$|E
6000|$|Here, too, the {{men that}} mend our village ways, Vexing Macadam's ghost with pounded slate, Their nooning take; much noisy talk they spend On horses and their ills; and, as John Bull Tells of Lord This or That, who was his friend, So these make boast of intimacies long [...] 270 With famous teams, and add large estimates, By {{competition}} swelled from mouth to mouth. Of how much they could draw, till one, ill pleased To have his legend overbid, retorts: 'You take and stretch truck-horses in a string From here to Long Wharf end, <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> Not heavy neither, they could never draw,-- Ensign's long bow!' Then laughter loud and long. So they in their leaf-shadowed microcosm Image the larger world; for wheresoe'er [...] 280 Ten men are gathered, the observant eye Will find mankind in little, as the stars Glide up and set, and all the heavens revolve In the small welkin of a drop of dew.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I don't mind telling you," [...] {{the lady}} continued, leaning over towards him confidentially, [...] "that I'm dead off {{that old man}} who came prying round and took me out to dinner, to pump me about poor Barney! He didn't get much out of me. For <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> much. But the little <b>I</b> do <b>know</b> I'd sooner tell you than him." ...|$|R
6000|$|She wouldn't hear of it. [...] "Oh, Bernard, have I {{not learned}} to trust you yet? Put away those papers. There is only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> want to <b>know.</b> Who {{gave them to}} you? The Rector?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The fault was {{not exactly}} mine," [...] he said, with a faint {{hoarseness}} in his voice. [...] "For <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> how could <b>I</b> <b>know</b> {{that you would be}} pleased to see me?" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{now comes}} the strange part of my story--the part which will not, I suppose, be believed. If {{it were not for}} one thing I think I should hardly believe it myself. I should feel tempted to think I had dreamed it. But because of that <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it was real. The night was very calm and still. Not a breath of wind stirred. The moonshine was the {{brightest}} I had ever seen. In the middle of the garden, where the shadow of the poplars did not fall, it was almost as bright as day. One could have read fine print. There was still a little rose glow in the west, and over the airy boughs of the tall poplars one or two large, bright stars were shining. The air was sweet with a hush of dreams, and the world was so lovely that I held my breath over its beauty.|$|E
60|$|What {{then does}} St. Paul mean, when he says, 'That he may fill all things?' I do not know. And I {{will take care}} not to lessen and spoil St. Paul's words, by any ignorant words of my own. But <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it will mean one day, for St. Paul says so. That Christ reigns, and will reign, triumphant over sin, and death, and hell, till he have put all enemies under his feet, and the last enemy that shall be {{destroyed}} is death. Then shall he deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father; that God may be all in all. What that means I do not know. But this I can say, and you can say. We can pray that God will finish the number of his elect and hasten his kingdom, that we, with all that are departed in the true faith, may have our perfect consummation and bliss, both in body and soul, in his eternal kingdom. And this I can say, that it means now, for you and me; for Whitsuntide tells me:--that whatever else Christ can or cannot fill, he can at least fill our hearts, because he is in the bosom of the Father himself; and therefore from him, as from the Father, proceeds the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of life. That Spirit will proceed even to us, if we will have him. He will fill our hearts with himself; with the Spirit of goodness, which proceeds out of the heaven of heavens, and out of the bosom of God himself; with love, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness; with truth, honour, duty, earnestness, and all that is the likeness of Christ and of God. Oh let us pray for that Spirit; the Spirit of truth, which Christ promised us when he ascended up into the heaven of heavens, to keep us sound in our most holy faith; and the Spirit of goodness, to give us strength to live the good lives of good Christian men.|$|E
6000|$|It {{is really}} {{wonderful}} how much resilience {{there is in}} human nature. Let any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way, even by death, and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. More than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether {{the whole of the}} past days had not been a dream. It was only when I caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker's forehead that I was brought back to reality. Even now, when I am gravely revolving the matter, {{it is almost impossible to}} realize that the cause of all our trouble is still existent. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her trouble for whole spells. It is only now and again, when something recalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are to meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of action. I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct rather than reason. We shall all have to speak frankly. And yet I fear that in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker's tongue is tied. I know that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I can guess how brilliant and how true they must be. But she will not, or cannot, give them utterance. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and he and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose it is some of that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. The Count had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called [...] "the Vampire's baptism of blood." [...] Well, there may be a poison that distills itself out of good things. In an age when the existence of ptomaines is a mystery we should not wonder at anything! <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> that if my instinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker's silences, then there is a terrible difficulty, an unknown danger, in the work before us. The same power that compels her silence may compel her speech. I dare not think further, for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And there's just <b>one</b> other <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> {{much about}} {{morality}} and that, {{but there is}} this: It's always worth while before you do anything to consider whether it's going to hurt another person more than is absolutely necessary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Quest," [...] she said, [...] "I like my {{work with}} you. You saved me from despair. Sometimes {{it seems to}} me that life now opens out an entirely new vista. Yet since this matter has been {{mentioned}} between us, let me tell you <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> have <b>known</b> no rest, night or day, since we heard of--of James's escape. I live in terror. If I have concealed it, it has been at the expense of my nerves and my strength. I think that very soon I could have gone on no longer." ...|$|R
5000|$|Butler {{opened his}} memoirs {{by saying that}} his career had been split between academia, {{politics}} and India, and that his main regret was never having been Viceroy of India. He regarded the 1935 India Act and the 1944 Education Act as his [...] "principal legislative achievements". He also wrote {{that the way to}} the top was through rebellion and resignation, whereas he had gone for [...] "the long haul" [...] and [...] "steady influence". In an obvious dig at Home, he said in retirement [...] "I may never have known much about fishing or flower-arranging, but <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> did <b>know</b> was how to govern the people of this country".|$|R

5000|$|To this epistle Agnes quickly replied: [...] "I {{perfectly}} comprehend.... Perhaps instinct comes nearer their description {{than either}} [...] "Principles" [...] or [...] "Whims". Think ye {{they have any}} connection with that 'heavenly light which leads astray'? <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> {{that they have a}} powerful effect on me, and are delightful when under the check of reason and religion.... Pardon any little freedoms I take with you." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1995, Konner {{produced}} and directed a documentary short, <b>One</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>Know,</b> which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, screened at the Cannes Film Festival, {{and won the}} Special Jury Prize at the USA Film Festival. In 2003, through his independent company, The Documentary Campaign, Konner produced Persons of Interest, a feature-length documentary about the illegal detentions of thousands of Muslims {{in the aftermath of}} September 11, which premiered in competition at the Sundance Film Festival and won the Amnesty International Humanitarian Award. In 2005, Konner produced the film Zizek!, a documentary which follows the internationally renowned philosopher Slavoj Žižek on a worldwide speaking tour.|$|E
6000|$|... "And there's just <b>one</b> more <b>thing,</b> Spike. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you'll excuse my {{mentioning}} it. When we're at Dreever Castle, {{you will}} find yourself within reach of {{a good deal of}} silver and other things. Would it be too much to ask you to forget your professional instincts? I mentioned this before in a general sort of way, but this is a particular case." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “To {{do justice}} to any subject, sir, the narrator must he {{suffered}} to proceed in his own way,” continued the sheriff. “You are of opinion, Judge Temple, that a man is to be qualified by nature and education to do only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> well, whereas <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that genius will supply the place of learning, and that a certain sort of man can do anything and everything.” ...|$|R
60|$|Of {{the flight}} of time, I have no idea; {{it may have been}} three hours, and it may have been five, that the Indian laboured to reanimate his master's body. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> only <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> that it was still night, and the moon was not yet set, {{although}} it had sunk low, and now barred the plateau with long shadows, when Secundra uttered a small cry of satisfaction; and, leaning swiftly forth, I thought I could myself perceive a change upon that icy countenance of the unburied. The next moment I beheld his eyelids flutter; the next they rose entirely, and the week-old corpse looked me for a moment in the face.|$|R
