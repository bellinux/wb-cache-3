40|$|Description The target {{equivalence}} range (TEQR) {{design is}} a frequentist {{implementation of the}} modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design and a competitor to the standard 3 + 3 design (3 + 3). The 3 + 3 is the work horse design in Phase I. It is good at determining if a safe dose exits, but provides poor accuracy and precision in estimating the level of toxicity at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The TEQR {{is better than the}} 3 + 3 when compared on: 1) the number of times the dose at <b>or</b> <b>nearest</b> the target toxicity level was selected as the MTD, 2) the number of subjects assigned to doses levels, at <b>or</b> <b>nearest</b> the MTD, and 3) the overall trial DLT rate. TEQR more accurately and more precisely estimates the rate of toxicity at the MTD because a larger number of subjects are studied at the MTD dose. The TEQR on average uses fewer subjects and provide reasonably comparable results to the continual reassessment method (CRM) in the number of times the dose at <b>or</b> <b>nearest</b> the target toxicity level was selected as the MTD and the number of subjects assigned doses, at, <b>or</b> <b>nearest</b> the target and in overall DLT rate...|$|R
