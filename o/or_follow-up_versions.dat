The Jabiru Mk.2 was launched ten times at Woomera between 1964 and 1970. This rocket was replaced by the Jabiru Mk.3 which used a modified first stage of the Jabiru Mk.2 as second stage, while the first stage remained unchanged. No third stage was used on the Mk.3. The Jabiru Mk.3 was used for re-entry experiments between 1971 and 1974.|$|R

40|$|The {{monitoring}} <b>or</b> <b>follow-up</b> of {{a person}} subjected to a health care intervention is a daily routine nursing activity.

In spite of the high percentage workload and use of resources that patient follow up represents within the health system, it is a poorly investigated area. In the present article we examine the differences between a test versus a monitoring strategy, the conditions that justify the monitoring, the methodology to evaluate a follow-up strategy,, as well as creating initiatives to improve monitoring (MaDOx) worldwide. © 2009 Elsevier España, S.
