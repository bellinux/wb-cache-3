40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse {{the effect of}} {{immigration}} on the labour market conditions for different skill groups. We develop a model of endogenous labour supply in which immigration affects educational decisions. We show how the skill premium changes with immigration <b>of</b> low <b>skilled</b> labour under flexible and rigid wages. Depending on the labour market institutions, immigration <b>of</b> low <b>skilled</b> labour is absorbed either by an increased skill premium or increased unemployment <b>of</b> low <b>skilled</b> labour. Thus, we extend the existing explanations of changing skill premia and unemployment <b>of</b> low <b>skilled</b> labour experienced during the last decades. Our model gives a rationale for the debate on immigration <b>of</b> high <b>skilled</b> workers {{as a way to}} reduce unemployment <b>of</b> low <b>skilled</b> workers in highly rigid labour markets.

The aim of this work to show current migration flows <b>of</b> highly <b>skilled</b> workers and particularly flows <b>of</b> highly <b>skilled</b> Asian migrants.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} extent of labour market {{competition}} among native Dutch workers and ethnic minorities, using national survey of the SEO and the Population statistics of the CBS. Firstly, the direct effect of immigrants on local labour markets is considered. It is shown that ethnic minorities from developing countries have a positive eect on the earnings <b>of</b> high <b>skilled</b> natives and an adverse effect on the earning <b>of</b> low <b>skilled</b> native workers. On the other hand, ethnic minorities from EU-countries may {{have a negative effect}} on the earnings <b>of</b> high <b>skilled</b> natives and a positive effect on the earnings <b>of</b> low <b>skilled</b> natives. Second ly, the effect of an immigration flow by 5 % of the total labour force on native earnings is examined along three scenarios using a general equilibrium model. It is found that immigration has a large negative effect on the wages <b>of</b> less <b>skilled</b> natives and a small positive effect on the wages <b>of</b> high <b>skilled</b> workers as new immigrants are less skilled than native [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Significant {{declines in}} {{employment}} have coincided with trade liberalisation in South Africa stimulating many debates on possible causal {{relationships between the}} two. Existing research has, however, focussed on explaining employment trends rather than changes in the relative wage <b>of</b> less <b>skilled</b> to skilled labour. Further, the role of technology in influencing relative wages has been neglected. This paper draws upon standard international trade theory and analyses the relationship between trade, technology, factor supplies and the relative wage <b>of</b> less <b>skilled</b> workers in South Africa since 1970. The econometric results are in general weak. Nevertheless, a number of conclusions can be reached. Firstly, the rise in relative wage <b>of</b> less <b>skilled</b> workers since the early 1970 s and into the 1990 s is inconsistent with the view that trade liberalisation and skill biased technological change lie behind the dramatic decline in less skilled employment since the early 1980 s. Secondly, there is weak evidence that tariff reductions and improvements in the {{real effective exchange rate}} have improved the relative wage <b>of</b> less <b>skilled</b> labour. Although the rise in relative wage <b>of</b> less <b>skilled</b> labour is consistent with these changes, the decline in employment <b>of</b> less <b>skilled</b> labour is not. These results suggest that the reason for the decline in employment <b>of</b> less <b>skilled</b> labour lie in other areas such as the labour market.

5|$|Ibn Batuta, {{during his}} visit in 1344, {{observed}} that the kingdom of Jaffna was a major trading kingdom with extensive overseas contacts. The Kingdom's trades were oriented towards maritime South India, with which it developed a commercial interdependence. The non-agriculture tradition of the kingdom became strong {{as a result of}} large coastal fishing and boating population and growing opportunities for seaborne commerce. Influential commercial groups, drawn mainly from south Indian mercantile groups as well as other, resided in the royal capital, port, and market centers. Artisan settlements were also established and groups <b>of</b> <b>skilled</b> tradesmen—carpenters, stonemasons, wavers, dryers, gold and silver smiths—resided in urban centers. Thus, a pluralistic socio-economic tradition of agriculture marine activities, commerce and handicraft production was well established.|$|E

40|$|In a {{knowledge-based}} economy, innovation {{has become}} a key driver of economic growth. The return migration <b>of</b> highly <b>skilled</b> workers to traditional sending countries such as Taiwan, China, and India has increased the international mobility <b>of</b> highly <b>skilled</b> workers in the Science and Technology sector.

This research project will analyze highly skilled workers’ role in innovation and analyze international migration trends <b>of</b> highly <b>skilled</b> workers. It argues that highly skilled workers have become more valuable in the innovation process as their international mobility has increased in a knowledge-based economy and receiving countries that rely on highly skilled immigrants need to recognize that permanent migration may not be in today’s minds of migrants. Rather, onward and circular migration policies need to be framed...|$|R

To stimulate the construction industry, credit was offered to private businesses and subsidies were made available for home purchases and repairs. On the condition that the wife would leave the workforce, a loan of up to 1,000 Reichsmarks could be accessed by young couples of Aryan descent who intended to marry and the amount that had to be repaid was reduced by 25 percent for each child born.

5|$|One {{issue that}} was {{foreseen}} {{as a potential}} problem was the supply <b>of</b> <b>skilled</b> officers to the Army in wartime, and a committee was established in 1906 under Sir Edward Ward to study the matter.

Another source was the Women's Army Corps (WAC). Initially intended for clerical tasks handling classified material, the WACs were soon tapped for technical and scientific tasks as well. On 1 February 1945, all military personnel assigned to the MED, including all SED detachments, were assigned to the 9812th Technical Service Unit, except at Los Alamos, where military personnel other than SED, including the WACs and Military Police, were assigned to the 4817th Service Command Unit.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Öland was {{the first}} of several major Swedish defeats at sea that ended in {{complete}} Danish dominance over the southern Baltic {{for the duration of the}} Scanian War. That the main naval base in Stockholm was locked in ice during the winter of 1675–76 showed the necessity of an ice-free harbor that was closer to Danish home waters. In 1679, King Charles personally chose the site for a new base at what would later become Karlskrona. The lessons from the war also led to improvements in Swedish naval organization under the guidance of Hans Wachtmeister (1641–1714) which included better funding and maintenance, increased readiness for mobilization in the southern Baltic and permanent recruitment <b>of</b> <b>skilled</b> personnel through the allotment system.|$|E
5|$|The Finnish Red Guards {{seized the}} early {{initiative}} in the war, {{taking control of}} Helsinki on 28 January, and with a general attack phase lasting from February till early March 1918. The Reds were relatively well armed, but a chronic shortage <b>of</b> <b>skilled</b> leaders, both at command level and in the field, left them unable to capitalize on their initial momentum, {{and most of the}} offensives came to nothing. The military order chain functioned relatively well at Red company and platoon level, but leadership and authority were weak, as most of the field commanders were chosen by the vote of the troopers. The common troopers were more or less armed civilians, whose military training, discipline and combat morale were both inadequate and low.|$|E

30|$|One of {{the early}} explanations, the {{original}} version of the skill biased technological change (henceforth SBTC) hypothesis, attributed these changes to technological development (e.g. Katz and Murphy 1992; Levy and Murnane 1992). It was assumed that technological change will increase the productivity <b>of</b> highly <b>skilled</b> workers more strongly than that <b>of</b> their low <b>skilled</b> counterparts, thereby increasing demand for workers with higher skills. Unless this increasing demand is offset by a larger number <b>of</b> highly <b>skilled</b> workers entering the labor market, this should result in increasing wages for this group of employees. Acemoglu and Autor (2011) call this the “canonical model” of SBTC.|$|R
