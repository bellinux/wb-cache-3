5|$|Cluster {{diffusion}} involves {{motion of}} atomic clusters {{ranging in size}} from dimers to islands containing hundreds of atoms. Motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cluster</b> may occur via the displacement of individual atoms, sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cluster,</b> or the entire cluster moving at once.

5|$|As {{a result}} of a tidal shock, streams of stars can be pulled away from the cluster halo, leaving only the core part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cluster.</b> These tidal {{interaction}} effects create tails of stars that can extend up to several degrees of arc away from the cluster. These tails typically both precede and follow the cluster along its orbit. The tails can accumulate significant portions of the original mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cluster,</b> and can form clumplike features.|$|E

5|$|Core-collapse {{is thought}} to occur when the more massive stars in a {{globular}} cluster encounter their less massive companions. Over time, dynamic processes cause individual stars to migrate from the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cluster</b> to the outside. This results in {{a net loss of}} kinetic energy from the core region, leading the remaining stars grouped in the core region to occupy a more compact volume. When this gravothermal instability occurs, the central region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cluster</b> becomes densely crowded with stars and the surface brightness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cluster</b> forms a power-law cusp. (Note that a core collapse is not the only mechanism that can cause such a luminosity distribution; a massive black hole at the core can also result in a luminosity cusp.) Over a lengthy period of time this leads to a concentration of massive stars near the core, a phenomenon called mass segregation.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that the}} half-light radius {{includes}} {{stars in the}} outer part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cluster</b> that happen to lie {{along the line of}} sight, so theorists will also use the half-mass radius (r'm)—the radius from the core that contains half the total mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cluster.</b> When the half-mass radius of a cluster is small relative to the overall size, it has a dense core. An example of this is Messier 3 (M3), which has an overall visible dimension of about 18 arc minutes, but a half-mass radius of only 1.12 arc minutes.|$|E

5|$|This is {{the most}} common type of {{thunderstorm}} development. Mature thunderstorms are found near the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cluster,</b> while dissipating thunderstorms exist on their downwind side. Multicell storms form as clusters of storms but may then evolve into one or more squall lines. While each cell <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cluster</b> may only last 20minutes, the cluster itself may persist for hours at a time. They often arise from convective updrafts in or near mountain ranges and linear weather boundaries, such as strong cold fronts or troughs of low pressure. These type of storms are stronger than the single-cell storm, yet much weaker than the supercell storm. Hazards with the multicell cluster include moderate-sized hail, flash flooding, and weak tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Claims of {{intermediate}} mass {{black holes}} {{have been met}} with some skepticism. The heaviest objects in globular clusters are expected to migrate to the cluster center due to mass segregation. As pointed out in two papers by Holger Baumgardt and collaborators, the mass-to-light ratio should rise sharply towards the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cluster,</b> even without a black hole, in both M15 and Mayall II.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{relatively}} vast distances between stars outside the galactic nucleus, collisions between stars {{are thought to be}} rare. In denser regions such as the core of globular clusters or the galactic center, collisions can be more common. Such collisions can produce what are known as blue stragglers.

5|$|Size-dependence: {{the rate}} of cluster {{diffusion}} has a strong dependence on the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cluster,</b> with larger cluster size generally corresponding to slower diffusion.

5|$|The {{dynamical}} {{heating effect}} of binary star systems works {{to prevent an}} initial core collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cluster.</b> When a star passes near a binary system, the orbit of the latter pair tends to contract, releasing energy. Only after the primordial supply of binaries is exhausted due to interactions can a deeper core collapse proceed. In contrast, the effect of tidal shocks as a globular cluster repeatedly passes through the plane of a spiral galaxy tends to significantly accelerate core collapse.|$|E

By considering <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> centroid offset, Eddington bias, and triaxiallity, this difference can be reconciled. We use X-ray imaging data to quantify <b>the</b> dynamical state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clusters</b> and found that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clusters</b> appears dynamically relaxed, and two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clusters</b> host a cool core, consistent with Sunyaev–Zel'dovich-effect-selected clusters.

5|$|Another way of {{estimating}} the age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cluster</b> is {{by looking at}} the lowest-mass objects. In normal main-sequence stars, lithium is rapidly destroyed in nuclear fusion reactions. Brown dwarfs can retain their lithium, however. Due to lithium's very low ignition temperature of 2.5 × 106 K, the highest-mass brown dwarfs will burn it eventually, and so determining the highest mass of brown dwarfs still containing lithium in the cluster can give an idea of its age. Applying this technique to the Pleiades gives an age of about 115 million years.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{characterize}} the morphology of a globular cluster {{by means of}} standard radii. These are the core radius (r'c), the half-light radius (r'h), and the tidal (or Jacobi) radius (r't). The overall luminosity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cluster</b> steadily decreases with distance from the core, and the core radius is the distance at which the apparent surface luminosity has dropped by half. A comparable quantity is the half-light radius, or {{the distance from the}} core within which half the total luminosity from the cluster is received. This is typically larger than the core radius.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in October of each year, Pleione {{along with}} the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cluster</b> can be seen rising in the east in the early morning before dawn. To see it after sunset, one will need to wait until December. By mid-February, the star is visible to {{virtually}} every inhabited region of the globe, with only those south of 66° unable to see it. Even in cities like Cape Town, South Africa, {{at the tip of the}} African continent, the star rises almost 32° above the horizon. Due to its declination of roughly +24°, Pleione is circumpolar in the northern hemisphere at latitudes greater than 66° North. Once late April arrives, the cluster can be spotted briefly in the deepening twilight of the western horizon, soon to disappear with the other setting stars.|$|E

One possibility is that Messier simply {{wanted to have a}} larger catalogue than his scientific rival Lacaille, whose 1755 catalogue contained 42 objects, and so he added some bright, well-known objects to boost his list.|$|E
5|$|Globular {{clusters}} have a {{very high}} star density, and therefore close interactions and near-collisions of stars occur relatively often. Due to these chance encounters, some exotic classes of stars, such as blue stragglers, millisecond pulsars and low-mass X-ray binaries, are much more common in globular clusters. A blue straggler is formed from the merger of two stars, possibly {{as a result of an}} encounter with a binary system. The resulting star has a higher temperature than comparable stars in the cluster with the same luminosity, and thus differs from the main sequence stars formed at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cluster.</b>|$|E

However, another possible cause of this truncation is a contraction due to an unseen mass falling into M87 from the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cluster,</b> which, in particular, may be the hypothesized dark matter. A third possibility is that the halo formation was truncated as a result of early feedback from the active galactic nucleus at the core of M87.|$|E
