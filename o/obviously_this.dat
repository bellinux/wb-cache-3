25|$|In Dutch as {{spoken in}} the Netherlands, the word mitrailleur {{is widely used}} as a synonym for machinegeweer (machine gun). <b>Obviously,</b> <b>this</b> word {{is derived from the}} {{original}} mitrailleuse by changing the gender of the French word. In Dutch-speaking parts of Belgium, however, the word mitrailleur is rarely used, largely because it is regarded as poor French.|$|E
25|$|Peak {{accelerations}} can {{be increased}} by designing the vehicle with a reduced mass, usually achieved by {{a reduction in the}} fuel load and tankage and associated structures, but <b>obviously</b> <b>this</b> reduces range, delta-v and burn time. Still, for some applications that rockets are used for, a high peak acceleration applied for just a short time is highly desirable.|$|E

25|$|An {{instantaneous}} {{unit hydrograph}} {{is a further}} refinement of the concept; for an IUH, the input rainfall is assumed to all take place at a discrete point in time (<b>obviously,</b> <b>this</b> isn't the case for actual rainstorms). Making this assumption can greatly simplify the analysis involved in constructing a unit hydrograph, and {{it is necessary for}} the creation of a geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrograph.|$|E
25|$|<b>Obviously</b> <b>this</b> {{system is}} not viable in a {{capitalist}} society, since once the owners automate their factories, they just sack all their workers without pay and let them starve while the machines do all the work, filling their own pockets with gold from the profit. This is unjust {{and should not be}} tolerated. The boss who builds a machine that replaces one hundred workers should continue to pay these workers who now have nothing to do. Thus the machine should allow them to enter and benefit from the age of leisure.|$|E
25|$|Methodologically, social {{complexity}} is theory-neutral, {{meaning that}} it accommodates both local and global approaches to sociological research. The very idea of social complexity arises out of the historical-comparative methods of early sociologists; <b>obviously,</b> <b>this</b> method is important in developing, defining, and refining the theoretical construct of social complexity. As complex social systems have many parts {{and there are many}} possible relationships between those parts, appropriate methodologies are typically determined to some degree by the research level of analysis differentiated by the researcher according to the level of description or explanation demanded by the research hypotheses.|$|E

25|$|The job {{training}} of women was so completely {{integrated with the}} entire AAF training program that virtually no separate statistics are available {{as a basis for}} comparing the record of the women with male trainees. <b>Obviously,</b> <b>this</b> policy meant that the Wacs had to be as well qualified as men to enroll in and graduate from a training course. It is known only that approximately 2,000 women completed courses in AAF technical schools, including those for Link-trainer instructors, airplane mechanics, sheet-metal workers, weather forecasters, weather observers, electrical specialists of several kinds, teletype operators, control-tower specialists, cryptographers, radio mechanics, parachute riggers, bombsight-maintenance specialists, clerks, photo-laboratory technicians, and photo-interpreters.|$|E
25|$|The {{coat of arms}} of Jämtland, {{created for}} Karl X Gustav's funeral, derived from a seal which had been granted to Jämtland in 1635 by the Danish king. The beasts on this seal were {{difficult}} to identify. (Is the primary animal a deer, moose or reindeer? Is it a dog, wolf or bear? An eagle or a falcon?) The identity of these animals as a moose between a dog and a falcon was settled in 1884. According to popular perception, these represent Jämtland torn between Norway and Sweden, though <b>obviously</b> <b>this</b> meaning was not officially assigned by any royal authority. Svante Höglin claimed the scene to portray a moose hunted by a trained hunting dog and falcon, and in 1935 the coat of arms was revised, adding a collar and a bell to aid in identifying the dog and the falcon, respectively. Strangely, the revised blazon does not mention the moose's attire although the prototype in the Riksheraldikerämbetet (Swedish National Heraldry Office) is provided with secondary colours for the antlers, beak, hooves and claws.|$|E
25|$|How far these snakes {{can strike}} has been controversial. <b>Obviously</b> <b>this</b> {{depends on the}} size of the animal, but other factors may also play a role, such as the species, the {{position}} of the body, and the degree of excitement. Additionally, the question of definition exists: from which point on the snake should a strike be measured: from the front, the middle, or the back of the anchor coil on the ground? Even if the length of the specimen is known, once it strikes, it is almost impossible to determine the limiting point reached by its head and the position of its body when the movement started. Therefore, it is not surprising that many conflicting statements can be found in the available literature about how far these snakes can strike. Estimates have been given that range from one-third of the body length, to half, three-quarters or even the full length of the animal. They rarely strike further than half of their body length, and almost never more than three-fourths, but that it is still not wise to trust such values if only because it is not possible to accurately judge the length of a coiled snake.|$|E

500|$|The {{field of}} 34 drivers {{was the biggest}} in an IndyCar series race in 14 years. A typical oval track race has six to eight fewer drivers, except for the Indianapolis 500, which {{normally}} has a 33-car field. ESPN.com senior motorsports writer Terry Blount wrote: [...] "Obviously more cars presents more danger. They wanted {{a whole lot of}} cars cause <b>obviously</b> <b>this</b> is their season finale and they wanted it to be a big deal. Some of the people that were driving in this event yesterday had no business being in it. Some of them had never driven on a track like this. That was a mistake". Chris Powell, president of Las Vegas Motor Speedway, defended the race, saying that the circuit had passed all of the IndyCar Series' accreditation procedures and was deemed suitable for racing. He also went on the record to say that despite the media reporting the concerns of several drivers over the safety of the event, none of those concerns had been raised with him.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Jane Boursaw of TV Squad wasn't {{sure what to}} think about [...] "The Bishop Revival", but loved the plotline about Walter's dad being a German spy working for the US government. Alternately, Annalee Newitz of io9 called the episode [...] "surprisingly meh"; while appreciating [...] "all the weird family revelations about the Bishops", she believed the revelations about Walter's father to be [...] "too much" [...] because [...] "we didn't need that extra backstory". Newitz wished Fringe had brought back Olivia's childhood subplot and its ties with Walter and Peter. The A.V. Club columnist Noel Murray was also critical of the episode, explaining [...] "Plotwise, there wasn't much going on in 'The Bishop Revival.'... The FD tracked down a criminal and felled that criminal; that's really it." [...] Murray did however praise the killer's methods and [...] "Aryan aloofness" [...] as [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "delightfully old-school". Like Newitz, Tim Grierson of the magazine New York believed the episode contained [...] "stupid revelations"; for instance, the Nazi connection of Walter's father [...] "just felt like a variation on season one's episodes in which bizarre phenomena could always magically be linked back to Walter's work for the government. <b>Obviously,</b> <b>this</b> info about Peter's grandfather {{was supposed to be}} 'shocking,' showing how the Bishop family's scientific work can so easily be perverted for evil, but by this point it just seems like a very artificial, unnecessary ploy to keep us engaged." ...|$|E
