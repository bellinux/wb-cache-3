"Cruise ships {{generate}} {{a number of}} waste streams that can result in discharges to the marine environment, including sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, <b>oily</b> bilge <b>water,</b> <b>ballast</b> <b>water,</b> and solid waste.

Cruise ships represent a small — although highly visible — portion of the entire international shipping industry, and the waste streams described here are not unique to cruise ships. Particular types of wastes, such as sewage, graywater, and solid waste, may be of greater concern for cruise ships relative to other seagoing vessels, because of the large numbers of passengers and crew that cruise ships carry and the large volumes of wastes that they produce. Because cruise ships tend to concentrate their activities in specific coastal areas and visit the same ports repeatedly (especially Florida, California, New York, Galveston, Seattle, and the waters of Alaska), their cumulative impact on a local scale could be significant, as can impacts of individual large-volume releases (either accidental or intentional)." ...|$|R
