5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Bosch's work enjoyed a popular resurrection. The early surrealists' fascination with dreamscapes, the {{autonomy}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>imagination,</b> and a free-flowing {{connection to the}} unconscious brought about {{a renewed interest in}} his work. Bosch's imagery struck a chord with Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí in particular. Both knew his paintings firsthand, having seen The Garden of Earthly Delights in the Museo del Prado, and both regarded him as an art-historical mentor. Miró's The Tilled Field contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work. Dalí's 1929 The Great Masturbator is similar to an image {{on the right side of}} the left panel of Bosch's Garden, composed of rocks, bushes and little animals resembling a face with a prominent nose and long eyelashes.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{report that}} Bela Lugosi and Claude Rains were considered, {{with varying degrees}} of seriousness, for the role of Frankenstein's mentor, Pretorius; others report that the role was created {{specifically}} for Ernest Thesiger. Because of Mae Clarke's ill health, Valerie Hobson replaced her as Henry Frankenstein's love interest, Elizabeth. Early in production, Whale decided that the same actress cast to play the Bride should also play Mary Shelley in the film's prologue, to represent how the story— and horror in general— springs from the dark side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>imagination.</b> He considered Brigitte Helm and Phyllis Brooks before deciding on Elsa Lanchester. Lanchester, who had accompanied husband Charles Laughton to Hollywood, had met with only moderate success while Laughton had made a strong impact with several films including The Private Life of Henry VIII (for which he had won an Oscar) and Whale's own The Old Dark House. Lanchester had returned alone to London when Whale contacted her to offer her the dual role. Lanchester modeled the Bride's hissing on the hissing of swans. She gave herself a sore throat while filming the hissing sequence, which Whale shot from multiple angles.|$|E

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) In {{three of}} J. M. Coetzee’s recent novels, Disgrace (1999), Elizabeth Costello (2003), and Slow Man (2005), the South African author explores notions of authorship and {{challenges}} <b>the</b> possibilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sympathetic <b>imagination.</b> <b>The</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sympathetic <b>imagination</b> has roots in Romanticism, and it connotes inhabiting another {{in order to}} understand or interpret. Romantic poet John Keats described the poet as “continually in for [sic] and filling some other body” (Letter to Richard Woodhouse), and Coetzee addresses <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sympathetic <b>imagination</b> in his work. There are two facets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sympathetic imagination: that which governs social relations and that which authors and creative minds attempt to claim as a driving force behind their work. It is important not to conflate the two separate facets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sympathetic <b>imagination.</b> <b>The</b> social facet encourages good citizenship and allows humankind to behave in humane ways. It counters one’s private desire for mastery and balances self-interest with self-sacrifice; <b>the</b> sympathetic <b>imagination</b> helps others attain their goals and places others’ needs alongside one’s own selfishness. A sympathetic imagination is an essential quality in society, yet it will always yield only partial success. It cannot achieve complete success because truly inhabiting and embodying another living person is simply impossible, but in fiction, Coetzee explores the possibilities and limits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sympathetic <b>imagination</b> at <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> language and metaphor. <b>The</b> other facet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sympathetic <b>imagination</b> is often claimed by authors, poets, and artists to allow them to inhabit <b>the</b> subjects <b>of</b> their creativity. Coetzee tests <b>the</b> limits <b>of</b> authorial claims that writing is accomplished by applying a sympathetic imagination. In doing so, he creates metaphysical frames in which his own author-characters interact with other characters to reveal that some characters resist being written. In these metaphysical frames of fiction, Coetzee suggests that an author’s sympathetic imagination will never have total success; he sets forth a notion of partial success that helps address what is gained when <b>the</b> sympathetic <b>imagination</b> runs up against limits. My argument is that the authors and characters in these three novels attempt acts of sympathetic imagination and recurrently encounter limits. Coetzee questions perceived notions <b>of</b> authorship and <b>the</b> possibilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sympathetic <b>imagination</b> without offering alternatives. He critiques common notions of authorship and character writing but offers no real solutions...|$|R

5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus {{is that those}} who have little shall have less, and {{that those who have}} much shall take all that others have left. The people are poor; therefore they ought to be starved. They are slaves; therefore they ought to be beaten. They work hard; therefore they ought to be treated like beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they ought not to be allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E

This thesis is a comprehensive investigation of Russell Kirk’s doctrine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moral <b>Imagination.</b> It focuses especially on <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moral <b>Imagination</b> as integrative and non-reductionist, or what Kirk sometimes describes as illative. It explores Kirk’s development of this concept as one through which the individual can grasp his fully human nature and dignity, and which makes use <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> important areas <b>of</b> human social interactions and all <b>the</b> human faculties <b>of</b> knowing, providing man with immersive moral knowledge and support. The thesis is significant for its unique focus on Kirk’s Christian humanist influences – especially T. S. Eliot, Christopher Dawson, G. K. Chesterton, and C. S. Lewis. The aim is to understand Kirk’s attempt to develop <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> a normative imagination that avoids reductionism in understanding man’s moral life, by presenting a unified vision that neglects no important aspects of man’s life, being, and social interactions. The thesis also aims to explore the norms that Kirk believes it is <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moral <b>Imagination</b> to apprehend and to structure human life. This contribution is clarified through comparing Kirk’s use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moral or normative imagination to recent use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept by writers such as Martha Nussbaum and David Bromwich. This thesis also contrasts Kirk’s vision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moral <b>Imagination</b> with <b>the</b> kind <b>of</b> sceptical conservatism exemplified in <b>the</b> writings <b>of</b> Michael Oakeshott. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this comparison is to discover whether Kirk’s theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moral <b>Imagination</b> can overcome <b>the</b> limitations <b>of</b> a conservatism that rejects <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> universal norms and purposes in politics and constructs its conservatism only on <b>the</b> foundation <b>of</b> avoiding rapid and incautious change.

25|$|Wilson's first {{political}} work, Congressional Government (1885), {{advocated a}} parliamentary system.

25|$|Unger {{sees the}} Christian-Romantic {{tradition}} {{as the one}} tradition that puts the individual {{at the center of}} the world and gives him the tools for the liberation of self and environment. However, similar to the world's religious and philosophical traditions, it fails to provide a lasting answer to the predicament of human existence. This failure is the constant danger that after liberation the self will return to its customary affairs and routine practices. Rather than moving onwards to greater feats of humanity and godlike existence, the individual will allow everyday affairs to again take over. This surrender to habit is directly linked to the defeat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>imagination.</b> Thus metaphysical revolution is needed through a psychology of empowerment and an analysis of social conditions upon which this empowerment relies. Unger’s project begins here.|$|E

25|$|In 1924 André Breton {{published}} the Surrealist Manifesto. The Surrealist movement in painting became {{synonymous with the}} avant-garde and which featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like Machine Turn Quickly, (above) Francis Picabia continued {{his involvement in the}} Dada movement through 1919 in Zürich and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in Surrealist art. Yves Tanguy, René Magritte and Salvador Dalí are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>imagination.</b> Joan Miró's The Tilled Field of 1923–1924 verges on abstraction, this early painting of a complex of objects and figures, and arrangements of sexually active characters; was Miró's first Surrealist masterpiece. The more abstract Joan Miró, Jean Arp, André Masson, and Max Ernst were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.|$|E
