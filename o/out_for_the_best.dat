As a result of a rock slide that occurred on the set of where Castle Black is staged at Magheramorne Quarry, scheduling for the filming of the scenes had to be re-worked by executive producer Bernie Caulfield and producer Chris Newman, with showrunner D. B. Weiss saying, [...] "It actually worked <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> – some of the stuff we were shooting in that location benefited from the additional prep time the rock slide gave us." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Winona Ryder was {{the first}} cast member {{attached}} to the script, Dianne Wiest {{was the first}} to sign on. [...] "Dianne, in particular, was wonderful", Burton said. [...] "She was the first actress to read the script, supported it completely and, because she is so respected, once she had given it her stamp of approval, others soon got interested". When it came to casting the lead role of Edward, several actors were considered; Fox was insistent on having Burton meet with Tom Cruise. [...] "He certainly wasn't my ideal, but I talked to him", Burton remembered. [...] "He was interesting, but I think it worked <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> A lot of questions came up". Cruise asked for a [...] "happier" [...] ending. Gary Oldman and Tom Hanks turned down the part, the latter in favor of critical and commercial flop The Bonfire of the Vanities. Oldman declined as he found the story absurd, but said of the finished film: [...] "Literally two minutes in, I went, 'Yeah, I get it'. I just got it too late." [...] Jim Carrey was also considered for the role, while Thompson favored John Cusack. Elsewhere, William Hurt, Robert Downey Jr. and musician Michael Jackson expressed interest, although Burton neglected to converse with Jackson.|$|E
500|$|One day, {{the protagonists}} {{seek out a}} dervish known as a great philosopher of the land. Pangloss asks him why Man is made to suffer so, and what they all ought to do. The dervish {{responds}} by asking rhetorically why Pangloss {{is concerned about the}} existence of evil and good. The dervish describes human beings as mice on a ship sent by a king to Egypt; their comfort does not matter to the king. The dervish then slams his door on the group. Returning to their farm, Candide, Pangloss, and Martin meet a Turk whose philosophy is to devote his life only to simple work and not concern himself with external affairs. He and his four children cultivate a small area of land, and the work keeps them [...] "free of three great evils: boredom, vice, and poverty." [...] Candide, Pangloss, Martin, Cunégonde, Paquette, Cacambo, the old woman, and Brother Giroflée all set to work on this [...] "commendable plan" [...] (louable dessein) on their farm, each exercising his or her own talents. Candide ignores Pangloss's insistence that all turned <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> by necessity, instead telling him [...] "we must cultivate our garden" [...] (il faut cultiver notre jardin).|$|E

2500|$|Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave [...] "We Dance On" [...] a {{four out}} of five rating. He felt that when N-Dubz teamed up with Bodyrox for their soundtrack {{contribution}} to StreetDance 3D, they clearly took on board what the film was all about: overcoming prejudices and, the merging of diverse styles of music and dance. Copsey said, [...] "Much like the film itself, 'We Dance On' features an assortment of different influences that might seem contradictory on paper, but inevitably work <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> in the end." [...] He noted that the verses about pursuing your dreams like a [...] "fox on a mission" [...] and [...] "the big, Bob Marley-inspired chorus – [...] "I know everything's gonna be alright/Now you're standing here by my side" [...] will surely tug at the heartstrings of the song's listener. Copsey {{went on to say that}} the track [...] "leaves you feeling warm, fuzzy and [...] better inside." [...] BBCs Fraser McAlpine felt that [...] "We Dance On" [...] was capable of bringing its listener to tears with, [...] "massive churning string section" [...] from Johann Pachelbel's [...] "Canon in D Major" [...] and few [...] "everything's gonna be alright" [...] chants. McAlpine noted that the string section contains influences from The Farm's [...] "All Together Now" [...] (1990). He went on to interpret the song's chants as being inspired by Bob Marley's [...] "No Woman, No Cry" [...] (1974). Gavin Martin of the Daily Mirror gave [...] "We Dance On" [...] three out of five stars in his review of the single. He highlighted Tulisa Contostavlos' contribution in the song, saying: [...] "Often forced to take a back seat while her male counterparts lead, N-Dubz' front lady Tulisa comes out front for this". Martin went on to describe the song as a [...] "crowd-pleasing and unifying floor filler with a hint of classical spice." ...|$|E
