Reacting to media reports of unprovoked atrocities by the OMON, four members of the Russian parliament intervened on behalf of the Armenians, arriving in Voskepar on 15 May. Anatoly Shabad, the leading parliamentary member, secured the return of the captured Armenian policemen as the Soviet forces desisted from continuing <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operation.

Neither vessel saw any combat during the conflict. After the war, they cruised the Mediterranean and were involved in several international incidents, including at Corfu in 1923. In 1933, both ships were placed in reserve. In 1937 the ships began a lengthy reconstruction. The modifications included removing their center main battery turret and boring <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guns to , strengthening their armor protection, installing new boilers and steam turbines, and lengthening their hulls. The reconstruction work lasted until 1940, by which time Italy was already engaged in World War II.|$|E

He was Director of Training from 1936 to 1938, and commanded engineering and flying training schools for the first eighteen months of World WarII. Having been promoted to group captain in 1940, he was posted to Singapore in June 1941 to take charge of all RAAF units defending the area. He earned praise for his efforts in attacking invading Japanese forces before the fall of Singapore, and for his dedication in evacuating his men. After serving as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1942–44, he was appointed to a senior operational role with the Royal Air Force's 2nd Tactical Air Force in Europe, where he saw <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war.|$|E

5|$|In September 1967, {{the first}} {{successful}} Roundabout recruitment was Curtis' flatmate, the classically trained Hammond organ player Jon Lord; he had most notably played with The Artwoods, a band led by Art Wood, brother of future Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, and featuring Keef Hartley. At that time, Lord was playing in a band backing the successful pop vocalists The Flower Pot Men called The Garden, which also included bassist Nick Simper and drummer Carlo Little. Simper and Little were alerted by Lord of the Roundabout project and remained in standby for an eventual involvement. They recommended to Lord the guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, whose playing Chris Curtis had appreciated when his band The Searchers had played at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany. Blackmore {{had been a member}} of The Outlaws and had played as session and live musician with many beat, pop and rock acts, including Screaming Lord Sutch and the Savages, where he had met Little. Curtis contacted Blackmore to audition for the new group and persuaded him to move from Hamburg, where he was hanging out in local clubs. The guitarist came back to England for good to join the group in December 1967. Meanwhile, Curtis' erratic behaviour and his sudden loss of interest in the project he had started slowed down any development, forcing his financiers, HEC Enterprises, to drop him and entrust Lord and Blackmore with the task of filling <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band.|$|E

On March 29, Albrecht {{announced that he would}} use the graduate transfer option to play a fifth year at another school. On April 1, head coach John Beilein decided not to restrict Albrecht or teammate Ricky Doyle from transferring to schools within the Big Ten if they desired to do so. By April 18, Albrecht was considering interest from home state Big Ten programs Purdue and Indiana as well as Wichita State, Texas A, Syracuse, USC, and Milwaukee (where Michigan assistant coach LaVall Jordan had just taken over as head coach).|$|E

5|$|Scootie Randall {{returned}} to the Owls and earned the start, although he only played for six minutes and did not score. The game began with hot shooting by Penn State's Talor Battle, who drained three of his first four threes to put the Nittany Lions up 20–11. A 17-point first half by Juan Fernandez helped Temple Owls take a 35–33 lead at halftime. Jeff Brooks, a starting forward for the Nittany Lions, dislocated his right shoulder a minute into the half and sat <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. In the second half, there were ten lead changes, and neither team led by more than four points. Ramone Moore's 15 foot shot with 1:10 remaining pulled the Owls ahead 62–61. In Penn State's ensuing possession, Battle took {{the ball to the}} hoop but was blocked by Rahlir Jefferson, and Temple Owls took possession. Fernandez was fouled, and his pair of free throws with 28 seconds left extended the Owl lead to 64–61. With the clock at 12.2, Battle hit a three pointer from beyond the NBA line to tie the game at 64-64. Fran Dunphy called a timeout, and Khalif Wyatt advised Dunphy to draw up a play for Fernandez. Fernandez was double-teamed and was forced to take an off-balance 18-footer. The ball fell through the hoop with four seconds remaining, and Temple Owls won 66–64. Fernandez and Moore finished with 23 points, a season high for Fernandez.|$|E

He then suffered his worst period of form thus far {{at the start of}} the 193738 season, failing to reach double figures from 17 December 1937 until early January 1938, when he scored 64 in the second innings, against Victoria.

5|$|After {{completing}} his tenure at Richmond, De La Rue briefly took {{the role of}} senior air staff officer (SASO) at Central Area Command in October 1940. The following month, his name was put forward to establish an RAAF depot in London {{to look after the}} interests of the many thousands of Australian airmen disembarking there, but financial considerations led to the plan being scuppered temporarily. In fact, RAAF Overseas Headquarters would be formed on 1December 1941, with Air Marshal Williams appointed Air Officer Commanding (AOC). Meanwhile, De La Rue also missed out on a potential posting to the Middle East that was suggested by the British but turned down by the Australian government. Promoted acting air commodore, he became the inaugural AOC Western Area, headquartered in Perth, on 9January 1941. Among the units he controlled in this position were No.14 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron, No.25 (General Purpose) Squadron, No.35 (Transport) Squadron, and No.77 (Fighter) Squadron. De La Rue worked assiduously to prepare the latter for operations, as it was the only fighter squadron able to defend Perth and Fremantle. He also lobbied RAAF Headquarters for a force of long-range PBY Catalina flying boats to augment the Lockheed Hudsons of No.14 Squadron, but none were offered to him. De La Rue was made a temporary air commodore in July 1941. By February 1942, he was the eighth most senior officer in the RAAF. Handing over Western Area Command to Air Commodore Ray Brownell in January 1943, De La Rue became Inspector of Administration at RAAF Headquarters, in which post he saw <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war. On 8June 1944, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E
