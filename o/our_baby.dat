500|$|After a hiatus, Partridge {{returned}} in 2010 {{in a series}} of YouTube shorts, Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge, as the host of a digital radio show with co-presenter Sidekick Simon (Tim Key). Coogan co-wrote the shorts with brothers Neil and Rob Gibbons, who submitted scripts to his company Baby Cow Productions; the Gibbons have co-written every Partridge project since. According to Neil, Coogan [...] "invited us in, our sensibilities chimed, and before we knew it, Mid Morning Matters was up and running. We wrote it as if it was <b>our</b> <b>baby,</b> and though {{there was a sense that}} we were standing on the shoulders of giants, I think we were like two pairs of fresh eyes, and Steve seemed to fall in love with the character all over again." [...] Coogan said they chose the web format because [...] "it was a bit underground, a low-key environment in which to test the character out again. And the response was so good, we realised there was more fuel in the tank." [...] The shorts were later broadcast by Sky Atlantic.|$|E
500|$|Lennon's {{only child}} with Ono, Sean, {{was born on}} 9 October 1975 (his thirty-fifth birthday), and he took {{on the role of}} househusband, {{beginning}} what would be a five-year hiatus from the music industry during which he gave all his attention to his family. Within the month, he fulfilled his contractual obligation to EMI/Capitol for one more album by releasing Shaved Fish, a compilation album of previously recorded tracks. He devoted himself to Sean, rising at 6am daily to plan and prepare his meals and to spend time with him. He wrote [...] "Cookin' (In the Kitchen of Love)" [...] for Starr's Ringo's Rotogravure (1976), performing on the track in June in what would be his last recording session until 1980. He formally announced his break from music in Tokyo in 1977, saying, [...] "we have basically decided, without any great decision, to be with <b>our</b> <b>baby</b> {{as much as we can}} until we feel we can take time off to indulge ourselves in creating things outside of the family." [...] During his career break he created several series of drawings, and drafted a book containing a mix of autobiographical material and what he termed [...] "mad stuff", all of which would be published posthumously.|$|E

Josh Langhoff from PopMatters, however, felt that the song followed similar suit to that of MIA. Jocelyn Vena, from MTV News, commented that [...] "Sleazy" [...] "fits right in with [...] party-anthem discography". Daniel Brockman of The Boston Phoenix wrote that the song contains [...] "tribal anti-bourgeois bounce". Bill Lamb from About.com noted that Bangladesh's production [...] "pumps up the hard edge and club readiness". [...] "The Sleazy Remix" [...] features rapper André 3000, who raps over the song's [...] "bouncy thump" [...] beat talking about a young child dealing with his deadbeat father, [...] "We start out so cute in <b>our</b> <b>baby</b> pictures/ That mama shot for our daddy so that he wouldn't forget you/ He forgot anyway, but hey, one day he'll remember/ If not, he's human, I'm human, you human, we'll forgive him." [...] André then transitions into a rap about his friendship with Kesha before she takes over the rest {{of the song}}.|$|E

2500|$|Natalie Teeger (Traylor Howard; seasons 3–8) is Monk's {{second and}} final assistant. Although {{she is more}} deferential to her boss than Sharona, {{referring}} to him as [...] "Mr. Monk", she is not hesitant about telling him when his eccentricities are going too far. A young widow who lives with her daughter Julie, Natalie lost her husband Mitch {{when he was shot}} down over Kosovo in 1998. She first appears in [...] "Mr. Monk and the Red Herring" [...] (3.10). Natalie was introduced partway through season three when Bitty Schram, who played Sharona, left [...] "precipitous", reportedly over a contract dispute. Traylor Howard had not yet seen the show and was unenthusiastic about her manager's urgings to audition as Schram's replacement. She nevertheless tried out and got the part.

40|$|Abstract Background Preterm {{birth is}} the leading cause of {{perinatal}} morbidity and mortality. Risk factors for preterm birth include a personal or familial history of preterm delivery, ethnicity and low socioeconomic status yet the ability to predict preterm delivery before the onset of preterm labour evades clinical practice. Evidence suggests that genetics may play a role in the multi-factorial pathophysiology of preterm birth. The All <b>Our</b> <b>Babies</b> Study is an on-going community based longitudinal cohort study that was designed to establish a cohort of women to investigate how a women's genetics and environment contribute to the pathophysiology of preterm birth. Specifically this study will examine the predictive potential of maternal leukocytes for predicting preterm birth in non-labouring women through the examination of gene expression profiles and gene-environment interactions. Methods/Design Collaborations have been established between clinical lab services, the provincial health service provider and researchers to create an interdisciplinary study design for the All <b>Our</b> <b>Babies</b> Study. A birth cohort of 2000 women has been established to address this research question. Women provide informed consent for blood sample collection, linkage to medical records and complete questionnaires related to prenatal health, service utilization, social support, emotional and physical health, demographics, and breast and infant feeding. Maternal blood samples are collected in PAXgene™ RNA tubes between 18 - 22 and 28 - 32 weeks gestation for transcriptomic analyses. Discussion The All <b>Our</b> <b>Babies</b> Study is an example of how investment in clinical-academic-community partnerships can improve research efficiency and accelerate the recruitment and data collection phases of a study. Establishing these partnerships during the study design phase and maintaining these relationships through the duration of the study provides the unique opportunity to investigate the multi-causal factors of preterm birth. The overall All <b>Our</b> <b>Babies</b> Study results can potentially lead to healthier pregnancies, mothers, infants and children. </p...|$|R
