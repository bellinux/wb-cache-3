2500|$|The {{main reason}} to control directors’ power over share allottments and issues {{is to prevent}} shareholders’ rights being watered down if new shares are created. Under CA 2006 section 561, {{existing}} shareholders have a basic pre-emption right, to be offered any new shares first in proportion to their existing holding. Shareholders have 14 days {{to decide whether to}} buy. There are a series of exceptions under CA 2006 sections 564-567, for issuing bonus shares, partly paid shares, and employee shares, while private companies can opt out of pre-emption rules altogether. Furthermore, by special resolution (a three-quarter majority vote) under CA 2006 sections 570-571, shareholders may disapply pre-emption rights. In practice, large companies frequently give directors ad hoc authority to disapply pre-emption rights, but within the scope of a ‘Statement of Principles’ issued by asset managers. At present, the most influential guide is the document by the Institutional investors’ Pre-emption Group, Disapplying Pre-emption Rights: A Statement of Principle (...) [...] This suggests that the general practice is to disapply the pre-emption rights <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>basis</b> for routine share issues (e.g. shares subject to a clawback) at no more than 5% of share capital each year.|$|E
