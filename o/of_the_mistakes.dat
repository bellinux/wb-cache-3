Tallon totalled 508 runs at 33.87 for the season and made 33 {{dismissals}} in eight matches, including seven in one fixture against Western Australia, but failed to taste victory in a single Queensland match.

5|$|The DPP {{argued that}} it was never the {{intention}} of The Chaser to breach security and that they were allowed into the restricted area only because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistakes</b> of the police. The laws enacted for the summit meant that entry into the restricted zone needed justification, which could include police permission. The DPP stated that by waving The Chaser through, they had granted permission to be in the restricted zone. A further defence was available: all members charged, except Morrow, could argue that they were present for work-related purposes, and part of their employment was to be with Morrow, who was directing the stunt.|$|E

40|$|Every news medium makes mistakes. No {{matter if}} <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> is <b>the</b> {{information}} source or the journalist, a trustworthy medium always notifies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> and corrects it. This thesis deals with these corrections on <b>the</b> example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Czech News Agency {{to represent the}} news agencies. The theoretical grounds for the thesis are: to define <b>the</b> demands <b>of</b> news coverage, to present <b>the</b> specifics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> news coverage by news agencies, to offer relatively complex analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work with <b>the</b> sources <b>of</b> journalistic information. <b>The</b> application section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis analyses the corrections as published in the Czech News Agency's service {{during the first three}} months <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2011 calendar year. These corrections are categorized by several keys: by <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corrected <b>mistake,</b> by <b>the</b> affiliation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corrected <b>mistake</b> to <b>the</b> specific agency service and by <b>the</b> priority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corrected <b>mistake.</b> <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> analysis serve a practical purpose to journalists because they show them which type <b>of</b> corrections is <b>the</b> most common for a specific kind <b>of</b> <b>the</b> news coverage. I assume that <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>mistakes</b> is corrected (or at least that none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> types <b>of</b> <b>mistakes</b> and none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kinds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> news coverage is neglected more often than the others when correcting <b>the</b> <b>mistakes),</b> and [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Subsequent {{reviews of}} defence {{policy and the}} {{strategic}} situation in South East Asia after the war had resulted {{in the formation of}} the Australian Regiment in 1948, the first regular infantry unit of the Australian Army. From that time on as tension within the region increased the strength of the Regular Army increased rapidly in contrast to the CMF, signifying if not an end to Australian military planners' reliance upon citizen soldiers, at least a shift in focus and a realisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistakes</b> that had been made prior to World War II. This would see the CMF providing a platform upon which the Army could mobilise in the event of a war. Initially, the plan had been for the CMF to be made up of 50,000 men organised into two divisions and other units, however, recruitment was unable to meet these targets as initially it was attempted to achieve this through voluntary enlistment. Indeed, in its first year of existence, the actual strength of the CMF was only 8,698 personnel, although this rose the following year to 16,202 and to 32,779 in 1950. In March 1951, a system of compulsory national service was re-established.|$|E
5|$|Whoever {{looks in}} the past and thinks about the time of 1919 to 1932 will be {{overpowered}} by great pain in the face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistakes</b> that have been made. When Hitler published his book Mein Kampf, it was time to begin the most stringent battle against the theories proposed in that book. Hitler proposed to do away with all present parties and institutions, even those brought about after centuries of sacrifices and great exertion. What would a man do if a thief announced a proposed break-in? Anybody would make security arrangements. And what did the government and the representatives of the people do? As much as nothing. A tired, weak and sick population, as well as a weak government, let a charlatan of the worst sort promise them healing. For every problem this quack had the only right medicine. He alone possessed the magic wand that would uproot human weakness and produce angels.|$|E

The new Brazilian Republic was riddled with corruption and nepotism, and eventually there was a civil war in 1893-5. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistakes</b> made by the Republic was to withdraw support from the regions, no doubt to make sure resources went to the new rulers and their families. Travelling naturalists were to be based in Rio de Janeiro, and instructions were sent out to the regions. Müller refused point-blank and was dismissed, as was von Ihering in São Paulo.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistakes</b> of its commanders, Kaunitz with no {{more than}} 25,000 Coalition {{soldiers}} was able to defeat a 53,000-strong French army. On the 13th, Charbonnier's divisions baked bread at Fontaine-l'Evêque and stood idle at Mont-Sainte-Geneviève, leaving Desjardin and his 35,000 troops to do all the fighting. Without attempting any maneuver, Desjardin and his generals threw their soldiers, with no shoes, wet powder and shabby uniforms into the assault against enemies well-protected by solid fieldworks. The French troops lacked support from heavy cannons and had to contend with the superior Austrian cavalry, so it was not surprising that they were beaten. Around mid-day on 15 May, Kaunitz launched an attack to recapture some positions on the south bank of the Sambre. After three hours of skirmishing and artillery duels, the thwarted Austrian general withdrew his forces.|$|E

500|$|Allison Mack characterizes Chloe {{as being}} a [...] "misfit" [...] during the first season; more of [...] "a really smart girl with attitude".

The character is curious, and wants {{to be honest with}} people. She is always {{trying to make sense of}} the situation. Next to her curiosity, her impulsiveness is a key characteristic that eventually leaves her under the control of Lionel Luthor, when she offers to uncover information on Clark for Lionel. The reason for this betrayal is based on Chloe's love for Clark. As Allison Mack explains, Chloe is so blinded by her love for Clark that she neglects to see all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistakes</b> that he makes. It is this unrequited love for Clark that [...] "drives [...] to be as ambitious and as focused as she is".|$|E
