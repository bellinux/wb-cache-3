25|$|In September 1999, one of BP's US subsidiaries, BP Exploration Alaska (BPXA), {{pleaded guilty}} to {{criminal}} charges stemming from its illegally dumping <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> on the Alaska North Slope, paying fines and penalties totaling $22million. BP paid the maximum $500,000 in criminal fines, $6.5million in civil penalties, and established a $15million environmental management system at all of BP facilities in the US and Gulf of Mexico that are engaged in oil exploration, drilling or production. The charges stemmed from the 1993 to 1995 dumping <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> on Endicott Island, Alaska by BP's contractor Doyon Drilling. The firm illegally discharged waste oil, paint thinner and other toxic and hazardous substances by injecting them down the outer rim, or annuli, of the oil wells. BPXA failed to report the illegal injections when it learned of the conduct, {{in violation of the}} Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.|$|E

Some of the problems <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> regulation are that the negative effects <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> {{can be difficult to}} detect and controversial and that, due mainly to the large amount <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> that is generated (214 million tons in 1995), regulation can be difficult and costly.|$|R

40|$|During {{past years}} a great {{attention}} is paid to the problem <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> management. “Prevention costs” of the activities concerned with <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> are lower than “restoration costs” after damage is done. A proper management strategy for <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> is one <b>of</b> key components for a sustainable development. The quantity of various flows for <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> should be identified before a precise management strategy for <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> can be developed. Until now there is not one unique way how countries within the European Union should report on the yearly amount <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste.</b> Within the scope of the paper the methodology for quantification <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> flows was elaborated. The proposed methodology was applied for the case study of the Baltic States: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Objectives for the paper included: analysis of statistical data on amount <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> in the Baltic States, identification of statistically significant independent variables, which describe the <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> flows at 95 % confidence level, combination of statistical data analysis with evaluation of main indicators in order to propose the methodology for quantification <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> flows. The multiple regression analysis was carried out in order to identify the strength of correlation between amount <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> and defined independent variables. Based on the data analysis and literature reviews, the main indicators for the <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> flows were identified. By combining findings of the multiple regression analysis of statistical data and stated indicators, the methodology for quantification <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> flows was elaborated. Amount <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> is slowly, but steadily growing in the Baltic States. Since there is not common methodology in the European Union for the quantification <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> flows, various data sources shown different amount <b>of</b> generated <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> on the yearly basis in the Baltic States. The multiple regression equation, which describes statistical data at 95 % confidence level, was obtained. The equation includes 5 statistically significant independent variables. The equation can be used for the forecasts <b>of</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> in the Baltic States. The proposed methodology for the quantification <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> flows is based on unique solution, which combines study of main indicators with the use of multiple regression equation...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{recovery}} and disposal <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> {{is not a}} new concern.

2500|$|The Arky {{property}} is a non-Superfund clean-up site with focus by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, located at 217 Route 520 in Marlboro Township. This [...] site was an automobile junkyard. Contamination consisted of {{volatile organic compounds}} in the groundwater and soil contamination of metals, trichloroethylene (TCE), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Initial clean-up consisted of removal of the contaminated soil. Also found were buried drums of unknown product. There were 22 drums removed. In 1998, NJDEP conducted a second drum removal action. They excavated 70 buried drums and removed some of the contaminated soil around the drums. The drums <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> had been crushed and buried prior to 1987. To further monitor the property, NJDEP has installed additional monitor wells near the site to collect ground water samples. Investigations are continuing to determine if additional contamination is present on the site which would require clean-up actions.|$|E
