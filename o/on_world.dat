40|$|Starting with a {{likelihood}} or preference order <b>on</b> <b>worlds,</b> we {{extend it}} to a likelihood ordering <b>on</b> sets of <b>worlds</b> {{in a natural}} way, and examine the resulting logic. Lewis (1973) earlier considered such a notion of relative likelihood {{in the context of}} studying counterfactuals, but he assumed a total preference order <b>on</b> <b>worlds.</b> Complications arise when examining partial orders that are not present for total orders. There are subtleties involving the exact approach to lifting the order <b>on</b> <b>worlds</b> to an order <b>on</b> sets of <b>worlds.</b> In addition, the axiomatization of the logic of relative likelihood in the case of partial orders gives insight into the connection between relative likelihood and default reasoning.

Over {{the next two}} years, Stiller continued with the lackluster box office film Duplex, and cameos in Orange County and Nobody Knows Anything! He also guest-starred on several television shows, including an appearance in an episode of the television series The King of Queens in a flashback {{as the father of}} the character Arthur (played by Jerry Stiller). He also made a guest appearance <b>on</b> <b>World</b> Wrestling Entertainment's WWE Raw.|$|E
5|$|Argentina, {{like many}} other countries, entered into a {{recession}} following the beginning of World War I as international flows of goods, capital and labour declined. Foreign investment in Argentina came to a complete standstill from which it never fully recovered: Great Britain had become heavily indebted to the United States {{during the war and}} would never again export capital at a comparable scale. And after the opening of the Panama canal in 1914, Argentina and the other Southern cone economies declined, as investors turned their attention to Asia and the Caribbean. The United States, which came out of the war a political and financial superpower, especially perceived Argentina (and to a lesser extent Brazil) as a potential rival <b>on</b> <b>world</b> markets. Neither the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange nor the private domestic banks developed rapidly enough to fully replace British capital.|$|E
5|$|Benchley {{filled in}} for P. G. Wodehouse at Vanity Fair at the {{beginning}} of 1916, reviewing theatre in New York. This inspired staff at the Tribune magazine to creativity for articles (such as arranging for the producers of The Thirteenth Chair to cast Benchley as a corpse), but the situation at the magazine deteriorated as the pacifist Benchley became unhappy with the Tribunes position <b>on</b> <b>World</b> War I, and the Tribune editors were unhappy with the evolving tone and irreverence of the magazine. In 1917, the Tribune shut down the magazine, and Benchley was out of work again. When a rumored opening for an editorial position at Vanity Fair fell through, Benchley decided he would continue freelancing, having {{made a name for himself}} at the magazine.|$|E

After Jimbo and Kearney move their hands just before the record is claimed, the pyramid collapses into a giant sphere that rolls through town, taking in Agnes Skinner, Hans Moleman, and a suicidal man about to jump from a ledge onto the street. The entire town rolls to a truck weighing station and the Duff record book officials say that Springfield is the world's fattest town, ahead of Milwaukee.|$|E

In December 1927, he was offered a position as an instructor at the Naval War College, where he taught classes <b>on</b> <b>World</b> War I, and on joint operations.|$|E
5|$|Marx's {{ideas have}} had a {{profound}} impact <b>on</b> <b>world</b> politics and intellectual thought. Followers of Marx have frequently debated amongst themselves over how to interpret Marx's writings and apply his concepts to the modern world. The legacy of Marx's thought has become contested between numerous tendencies, each of which sees itself as Marx's most accurate interpreter. In the political realm, these tendencies include Leninism, Marxism–Leninism, Trotskyism, Maoism, Luxemburgism and libertarian Marxism. Various currents have also developed in academic Marxism, often under influence of other views, resulting in structuralist Marxism, historical Marxism, phenomenological Marxism, analytical Marxism and Hegelian Marxism.|$|E

5|$|Miyazaki left Toei Animation in August 1971, and {{was hired}} at A-Pro, where he directed, or co-directed with Takahata, 23 episodes of Lupin the Third Part I. The two also began {{pre-production}} {{on a series}} based on Astrid Lindgren's Pippi Longstocking books, designing extensive storyboards; the series was canceled after Miyazaki and Takahata met Lindgren, and permission was refused to complete the project. In 1972 and 1973, Miyazaki wrote, designed and animated two Panda! Go, Panda! shorts, directed by Takahata. After moving to from A-Pro to Zuiyō Eizō in June 1973, Miyazaki and Takahata worked <b>on</b> <b>World</b> Masterpiece Theater, which featured their animation series Heidi, Girl of the Alps, an adaptation of Johanna Spyri's Heidi. Zuiyō Eizō continued as Nippon Animation in July 1975. Miyazaki also directed the television series Future Boy Conan (1978), an adaptation of Alexander Key's The Incredible Tide.|$|E
5|$|Once again {{using the}} ring name Bruiser Beldam, he {{wrestled}} for Insane Championship Wrestling (ICW) {{for a short}} time in 1996. While there, he competed in a barbed wire baseball bat match against Ian Rotten; Bedlam was booked for the victory in the match. He also wrestled New Jack at ICW's Holiday Hell supercard in a match that ended in a double countout. He wrestled <b>on</b> <b>World</b> Championship Wrestling's first annual Ilio DiPaolo tribute show, teaming with Cowboy Johnson in a loss to Tony Parisi and Dominic DeNucci. In the late 1990s, Croitoru wrestled in Cambridge, Ontario-based International Championship Wrestling. He feuded with Greg Valentine, and the two wrestled in a series of matches. Bedlam won the ICW Heavyweight Championship from Valentine and used heel tactics such as brass knuckles to defend the belt.|$|E
