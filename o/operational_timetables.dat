2500|$|In March 2006, Tri-Rail {{went from}} 30 {{passenger}} trains {{a day to}} 40 trains; {{the completion of the}} New River rail bridge, the double-tracking project, and the addition of a second Colorado Railcar diesel multiple unit (DMU) ushered in sweeping changes to Tri-Rail's <b>operational</b> <b>timetables.</b> Tri-Rail added several more trains during peak weekday commuting hours in June 2007, increasing to the current 50 trains per day, as well as increasing weekend service. During [...] "rush-hour," [...] trains ran every twenty to thirty minutes rather than the previous schedule of every hour. This change comes at quite a fortuitous time in Tri-Rail's operation history. With gasoline prices at record highs—particularly in South Florida's sprawling metropolis—Tri-Rail saw a double-digit percentage increase in ridership in mid-2007. Over 4.2million passengers rode the line in 2009, a record number for the year. This was also the time during which work was being done on I-95 to add the express lanes from the Golden Glades Interchange to the Airport Expressway near downtown Miami.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a timetable-dependent method for assessing railway capacity, {{based on the}} generation and the analysis of sets of feasible timetables. This approach permits to consider all the major variables which characterise railway operations, together with their mutual interactions. These variables are evaluated as key performance indexes of nominal and <b>operational</b> <b>timetables.</b> The first are automatically generated by an heuristic greedy scheduling algorithm, while operational ones are provided by the discrete event simulation of traffic perturbations. The article focuses on two applications of this method. A comparison is carried out with a similar method - already presented in literature - {{which is based on}} a commercial software, providing an effective validation. Making use of a virtual case study, different approaches for obtaining "seeds" for the generation of feasible timetables are presented and discussed, pointing out their actual capability of being applied to real case studies and of encompassing different solutions. This case study is therefore used for presenting an analysis of the influence of buffer time on timetable stability. Finally an application for determining the capacity saturation limit of a line is presented. Timetables featuring a raising number of daily/hourly trains are simulated, tracking the trend of the timetable performance indexes. Considerations are presented, regarding the way of interpreting this trend for obtaining the practical capacity limi...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{multi-stage}} mine production timetabling (MMPT) model to optimise open-pit mine production operations including drilling, blasting and excavating under real-time mining constraints. The MMPT problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming model {{and can be}} optimally solved for small-size MMPT instances by IBM ILOG-CPLEX. Due to NP-hardness, an improved shifting-bottleneck-procedure algorithm based on the extended disjunctive graph is developed to solve large-size MMPT instances in an effective and efficient way. Extensive computational experiments are presented to validate the proposed algorithm that is able to efficiently obtain the near-optimal <b>operational</b> <b>timetable</b> of mining equipment units. The advantages are indicated by sensitivity analysis under various real-life scenarios. The proposed MMPT methodology is promising to be implemented {{as a tool for}} mining industry because it is straightforwardly modelled as a standard scheduling model, efficiently solved by the heuristic algorithm, and flexibly expanded by adopting additional industrial constraints...|$|R
50|$|The Lower Saxon town of Uelzen is the {{historical}} and geographical centre point of the route, and {{the point at which}} it is divided from a historical, <b>operational</b> and <b>timetable</b> point of view into an eastern section that is now electrified and upgraded, and a western section that is mostly non-electrified and also known as the Uelzen Railway (Uelzener Bahn).|$|R
40|$|For three rather diverse {{applications}} (truck scheduling for inter warehouse logistics, university-course <b>timetabling,</b> <b>operational</b> train <b>timetabling)</b> {{that contain}} integer multi-commodity flow {{as a major}} modeling element we present a computational comparison between a bundle and a full linear programming (LP) approach for solving the basic relaxations. In all three cases computing the optimal solutions with LP standard solvers is computationally very time consuming if not impractical due to high memory consumption while bundle methods produce solutions of sufficient but low accuracy in acceptable time. The rounding heuristics generate comparable results for the exact and the approximate solutions, so this entails no loss in quality of the final solution. Furthermore, bundle methods facilitate the use of nonlinear convex cost functions. In practice this not only improves {{the quality of the}} relaxation but even seems to speed up convergence of the method...|$|R
50|$|On 4 February the expeditionary corps fought {{its first}} action with the Chinese, at Tay Hoa. The battle was fought almost wholly by de Négrier's 2nd Brigade, which {{was leading the}} march, and {{demonstrated}} the unfitness for field command of Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Gustave Herbinger, the French commander who would in late March 1885 give the controversial order for the Retreat from Lang Son. Ordered to capture the 'Great Fort', {{the key to the}} Chinese position, with his three French line battalions, Herbinger made an elaborate flank march which exhausted his troops and wasted valuable time. At length, seeing his <b>operational</b> <b>timetable</b> threatened, de Négrier ordered Schoeffer's 3rd Legion Battalion to take the fort instead. The legionnaires scrambled rapidly up the mountain paths towards the Chinese position and captured it under Herbinger's nose. Meanwhile, {{on the other side of}} the battlefield, Captain Gravereau's company of Diguet's 2nd Legion Battalion was isolated and surrounded by the Chinese. The company was eventually disengaged by its comrades, but suffered heavy losses. Although the battle was indisputably a French victory, French casualties were disconcertingly heavy: 18 dead and 101 wounded, most of them in Diguet and Schoeffer's Legion battalions. These were the heaviest casualties the French had suffered in a single engagement since the start of the Sino-French War.|$|R
50|$|Moreover, {{these systems}} offer {{complete}} flexibility {{in terms of}} <b>operational</b> schedules or <b>timetables,</b> enabling urban rail operators {{to respond to the}} specific traffic demand more swiftly and efficiently and to solve traffic congestion problems. In fact, automatic operation systems have the potential to significantly reduce the headway and improve the traffic capacity compared to manual driving systems.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to study how {{selected}} variables influence delays in train traffic. Data has been collected on train movements, timetables, weather and capacity utilization on a highly utilized single-track railway line in southern Sweden during 2014. Based on this dataset, we have analysed how different factors affect delays in passenger traffic. We measure delays in a novel way, as deviations from the scheduled duration for each line section and station stop, not as deviations from a published or <b>operational</b> <b>timetable,</b> and this allows us to identify when and where the delays first occur. Average delays were much larger at station stops. The most significant factor affecting delays was the scheduled duration time at station stops and the existence of margins on line sections. If trains arrive to a line section or station stop slightly delayed they speed up the activity, otherwise they are typically delayed. The influence of weather was less significant and somewhat contradictory: snow and cold temperatures increase delays on line sections but reduce them at station stops, while precipitation made no difference. Capacity utilization seems to have a negative correlation with delays, but we have too little variation in the levels to be confident. All studied variables, except for precipitation, have impacts that are statistically significant to a very high degree of confidence, using both t-tests and regression analysis. The results of this study have important practical implications for timetable construction; for instance we estimate that a reallocation of scheduled time at stations could reduce delays by as much as 80 %...|$|R
25|$|The design also {{requires}} {{the use of}} slightly enriched uranium, enriched by about 1 or 2%. The main reason for this is to increase the burn-up ratio, allowing bundles to remain in the reactor longer, so that only a third as much spent fuel is produced. This also has effects on <b>operational</b> costs and <b>timetables,</b> as the refuelling frequency is reduced. As is the case with earlier CANDU designs, the ACR-1000 also offers online refuelling.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the integrated modelling of infrastructural, signalling and scheduling {{constraints on the}} operation of railway networks, which produce strong effects on {{the capacity of the}} network itself. The single constraining effects are identified and modelled, as much as their possible interactions are evaluated. The results are useful for facing a wide set of practical issues, including the evaluation of the introduction of innovative technological devices, the line and station layouts design, the <b>operational</b> planning and <b>timetabling,</b> the regularity assessment and monitoring, the apportionment of the available capacity between different services and/or operators...|$|R
40|$|The aim of <b>operational</b> train <b>timetabling</b> {{is to find}} a {{conflict}} free timetable for a set of passenger and freight trains with predefined stopping time windows along given routes in an infrastructure network so that station capacities and train dependent running and headway times are observed. Typical models for this problem are based on time-discretized networks for the train routes coupled by conflict constraints. They grow very fast for large scale instances and quickly lead to intractable models. Motivated by the observation that relaxations mostly use a narrow corridor inside such networks, we develop a general dynamic graph generation framework in order to control this size even for infinite time horizons. It can be applied to time-discretized networks modelling the routing of objects through capacity restricted handling stations with the property that early paths in the network are preferred. Without sacrificing any information compared to the full model, it includes a few additional time steps on top of the latest arcs currently in use. This “frontier” of the graphs can be extended automaticall...|$|R
3000|$|Type of {{outcomes}} or solutions The outcomes and solutions {{obtained from the}} U.S. studies included variety of different types such as delay analysis (UIUC by using RTC and USC by using Awesim/Minitab), rescheduling and recommendations related to current operations (UIUC and White) [21, 62], infrastructure development, and combination of all outcomes mentioned above (typically {{as part of a}} master plan). In addition, new tools and parametric models were also developed as the final outcome of three U.S. studies (mainly by UIUC). The outcomes of European studies were not so diverse, as they either approved the application of UIC’s capacity methodology to be used on their network [10, 36], or suggested network rescheduling and <b>operational</b> changes (the <b>timetable</b> compression concept) [25, 35, 63, 67, 70]. One of the common conclusions of various studies was the identification of operational heterogeneity as a major reason of delay, especially in the U.S. rail network with unstructured operation pattern.|$|R
40|$|Punctuality is {{regarded}} as an important measure {{of the performance of}} a railway system, and is the one most commonly used and discussed measure both in the industry and among travelers. In many countries, the punctuality of trains, and thus the performance of the railway system, is deemed as lacking. The aim {{of this article is to}} study and quantify how several weather-, <b>timetable,</b> <b>operational</b> and infrastructure-related variables influence punctuality in passenger train traffic. This can contribute to better understanding of the performance of railway systems, and help identify possible improvements. The study is based on a dataset containing detailed timetables and records of all 32. 4 million train movements for all trains in Sweden during the year of 2015, over 1. 1 million departures. Supporting this is a comprehensive register of over 80 000 infrastructure elements, and almost 87 million weather observations. We consider the size and allocation of margins, the existence of negative margins, two measures for traffic volume, the journey time and distance, how often different vehicle individuals are used, the number of line and station interactions between trains, the amount of precipitation, the temperature, wind speed, snow depth, and eight types of infrastructure elements. We show how these variables affect punctuality, and estimate how much of the variation in punctuality can be explained by them. The findings can be used to design <b>timetables,</b> change <b>operational</b> parameters and modify infrastructure design so that punctuality improves. They can also help identify areas which should be prioritized in planning, maintenance and research...|$|R
40|$|HSR {{represents}} {{the future of}} medium-haul intercity transport. In fact, a number of HSR projects are being developed {{all over the world}} despite the financial and economic crisis. Such large investments require reliable demand forecasting models to develop solid business plans aiming at optimizing the fares structure and the <b>timetables</b> (<b>operational</b> level) and, on the other hand, at exploring opportunities for new businesses in the long period (strategic level). In this paper we present a model system developed to forecast the national passenger demand for different macroeconomic, transport supply, and HSR market scenarios. The core of the model is based on the simulation of the competition between transportation modes (i. e. air, auto, rail), railways services (intercity vs. High Speed Rail) and HSR operators using an explicit representation of the timetables of all competing modes (schedule-based assignment). This requires, in turn, a diachronic network representation of the transport supply for scheduled services and a nested logit model of mode, service, operator, and run choice. To authors’ knowledge this {{represents the}} first case of elastic demand, schedule-based assignment model at national scale to forecast HSR demand. The overall modeling framework has been calibrated based on extensive traffic counts and mixed RP-SP interviews gathered between 2009 and 2011, on the Italian multimodal transportation system. The results of the models estimation are presented, and, some applications to test HSR service options (i. e. fares and timetable) of a new operator entering the HSR market and competing with the national incumbent are discussed...|$|R
30|$|The {{following}} {{strategies may}} be considered elements of energy-saving approaches: adoption of eco-driving profiles, regenerative braking, the introduction of timetable adjustments, exploitation of on-board and wayside storage systems, {{and the use of}} reversible substations. Clearly, they are strictly interrelated: the design of energy-efficient speed profiles consists in identifying the pattern which minimises tractive energy consumption, given a running time to be respected [245, 246], while strategies based on exploiting of regenerative braking aim to reuse the amount of kinetic energy produced during the braking phase by converting it back to electrical energy. In this case, the traction motor also acts as a generator and the recovered energy can be used at the same time or stored for later use by means of energy storage devices. For instance, an on-board storage device allows temporary accumulation of the excess energy regenerated and its release for the next acceleration phase of the same train [247, 248], while the aim of a wayside storage device is to release it when required for the acceleration of other convoys [249, 250]. In this context, timetable optimisation, aimed at synchronising acceleration and deceleration phases of convoys operating in the network, represents a key task for maximising the receptivity of the line [251, 252, 253, 254]. Additionally, the role of an energy-efficient timetabling phase lies in the suitable design of all operational times involved, such as running times, buffer times, dwell times and reserve times [165, 255, 256]. Moreover, by means of reversible or active substations, the energy regenerated can also be fed back into the medium voltage distribution network [257, 258, 259]. An extensive overview of regenerative braking issues and energy storage systems, together with the above-mentioned related concerns, can be found, respectively, in [260, 261]. This work, instead, focuses on strategies involving the design of suitable speed profiles and optimisation of <b>operational</b> times within <b>timetables</b> from an energy-saving perspective.|$|R
