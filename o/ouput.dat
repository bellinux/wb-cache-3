40|$|Abstract: An {{economic}} {{market approach}} to urban system modelling is described, where all interactions are characterized as exchanges in a market. This {{leads to a}} natural partition of an integrated urban model into submodels based on the category of good or service being supplied or demanded, the type of agent making the demand or supply, and {{the time and place}} of interaction. Actors communicate through 6 defined operations on markets, decoupling the algorithms representing different behaviour. Agent based approaches to simulation are a natural extension of the market approach, allowing a transaction based simulation of heterogeneous spatial markets with individual agents making specific offers in specific places at specific times, and other agents accepting those offers at future specific times. Incorporating many existing modelling methods into such a framework requires a set of average prices by segmenting markets by commodity category, space and time, and wrapping the modules in interfaces that recast the inputs and <b>ouputs</b> into market operations. The paradigm is applied to two existing modelling frameworks: the Sacramento MEPLAN model and the Oregon statewide TLUMIP model...|$|R

40|$|A very {{interesting}} quantum mechanical effect is {{the emergence of}} gravity– induced interference, which has already been detected. This effect also shows us that gravity is at the quantum level not a purely geometric effect, the mass of the employed particles appears explicitly in the interference expression. In this work we will generalize some previous results. It will be shown that the introduction of a second order approximation in the propagator of a particle, immersed in the Earth’s gravitational field, and whose coordinates are being continuously monitored, allows us to include, in the corresponding complex oscillator, a frequency which now depends on the geometry of the source of the gravitational field, a fact that is absent {{in the case of a}} homogeneous field. Using this propagator we will analyze the interference pattern of two particle beams whose coordinates are being continuously monitored. We will compare our results againt the case of a homogeneous field, and also against the measurement <b>ouputs</b> of the Colella, Overhauser, and Werner experiment, and find that the difference in the dependence upon the geometry of the source of the gravitational field could render detectable differences in their respective measurement outputs...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the joint {{estimation}} of Rayleigh fading channels and symbols in a MC-DS-CDMA system. Formerly, particle filtering has been introduced {{as a set of}} promising methods to solve communication problems. PF consists in simulating possible values of the unkwnown parameters and selecting the most likely candidates with regard to the received signal. Here, the Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) is used to significantly decrease the variance of the channel/symbol estimates. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, sinusoidal stochastic models have been shown to better represent the statistical properties of Rayleigh channels than classical autoregressive models. Therefore, the proposed RBPF estimator is based on these models which are expressed as the sum of two sinusoids in quadrature at the maximum Doppler frequency with autoregressive processes as amplitudes. The model parameters are unknown and need to be estimated. Since PFs are not wellsuited to recover non-varying parameters, we propose to crosscouple the RBPF with a Kalman filter which makes use of the RBPF <b>ouputs</b> to sequentially update the parameters. Secondly, the choice of an efficient proposal distribution to simulate the particles is crucial for PF performance. We suggest using a suboptimal distribution which simulates likely values of the symbols at a reasonable computational cost...|$|R
