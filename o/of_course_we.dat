Indeed, it was hard to blame the prison officer who observed that he thought it was the Minister for Defence paying an informal visit to Mountjoy Prison yesterday because, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>we</b> all know the Minister for Defence is wont to use helicopters, as somebody observed already, as other Ministers are wont to use State cars.|$|E

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{actuality}} use {{of cloud}} computing {{we have in the}} context of diploma thesis developed e-course for a guided education for building clouds based on OpenStack platform. In the first part we set design and content structure of the e-course on basics of a psychological approach of learning and guidelines for making e-learning. The course was divided into theoretical and practical learning units. Within the theoretical units were presented cloud computing, virtualization and the functioning of the platform. Within the practical part <b>of</b> the <b>course</b> <b>we</b> performed a basic installation and setup of platform. After the execution <b>of</b> the <b>course,</b> <b>we</b> have made empirical part of the thesis which elaborated evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>course.</b> <b>We</b> have performed a study on a small group of students who have made a systematic assessment of its value and some improvements in the future. In general the score <b>of</b> <b>course</b> is good. All activites <b>of</b> the <b>course</b> were performed in Moodle virtual classroom...|$|R

After wandering about in search of new ways, we shall again return to realism for more strength. I do not doubt that every abstraction on the stage, such as impressionism, for instance, could be attained by way of a more refined and deeper realism. All other ways are false and dead.|$|E
25|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>we</b> may {{expect to}} hear more about this part of the question; but even supposing Sir Morton Peto's apology to be true in point of fact, what a pitiful apology it is! He, an {{experienced}} man of business, and the regular financial adviser to the company, disclaims all responsibility for unjustifiable financial actions, if only the company's solicitors tell hint that it is all right. Surely it is not a legal question, but a moral question, whether it is permissible to concoct fictitious documents for the purpose of evading the provisions of an Act of Parliament.|$|E

The Vietnam War, and I {{was the head of the}} advance party of the PHILCAG (Philippine Civil Action Group to Vietnam) that went to a tiny province at the Cambodian border – the so-called Alligator Jaw – War Zone Z where even Max Soliven said ‘The Viet-Cong will eat us up.’ <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>we</b> were physically there as non-combat troops.

In our planning we have not ignored the problem of ending the war, nor would we ignore it {{in the event of a}} war. And, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>we</b> have, and we will keep, a survivable and enduring capability to attack the full range of targets, including the Soviet economic base, if that is the appropriate response to a Soviet strike.|$|E

500|$|This {{decision}} {{ignited a}} firestorm of worldwide protest for disregarding the historic discoverer's right to name new elements, and against the new retroactive rule against naming elements after living persons; the American Chemical Society stood firmly behind the name seaborgium for element 106, together {{with all the other}} American and German naming proposals for elements 104 to 109, approving these names for its journals in defiance of IUPAC. At first, IUPAC defended itself, with an American member of its committee writing: [...] "Discoverers don't have a right to name an element. They have a right to suggest a name.

The umpire had a bad angle on it and ruled that it had hit the screen and bounced back. I {{was sitting in the}} Cincinnati bullpen, and <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>we</b> weren't going to say anything. But Hack really hit 57 that year." [...] Wilson's official total of 56 stood as the NL record until the 1998 season, when it was broken by Sammy Sosa (66) and Mark McGwire (70).|$|E

The controversy led to accusations of Nazi sympathizing which have followed Slayer throughout their career. People took Hanneman's interest in Nazi history and his collection of Nazi medals, his most prized item being a German Knight's Cross, as evidence of sympathizing. Hanneman objected, stating: [...] According to guitarist Kerry King: [...] "Yeah, 'Slayer are Nazis, fascists, Communists'—all that fun shit. And <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> got the most flak for it in Germany. I was always like, 'Read the lyrics and tell me what's offensive about it.

In 1995 she told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "Our philosophy then, because we were only little kids, was wearing black clothes and going around looking moody. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>we</b> hadn't a clue who Jean-Paul Sartre was. We got inspired by all the French artists and writers, because that was the closest we could get. England was so far away, and America was out of the question. So France was the nearest.

[...] Peterson talked about the evolution of what Prince brought them: [...] "It was a Banglefication of a Prince arrangement. He had a demo, that was very specifically him. It was a good song, but we didn't record it like 'This is our first hit single! Oh my God! I can feel it in my veins!' We just did the song, and the album, and then sat back and thought about it." ...|$|E

I {{think that it was}} really nice for them to invite Astrid into the importance of that instead of keeping her in the dark. At least she knows that she's a part of this family and this affects her. I think she serves as a really important character in these later episodes because Astrid is kind of the only person that isn't directly involved with everything that is still on his side. She has {{to step up to the}} plate and be that comfort for him because if he doesn't have anyone there, he's basically going to regress and go back to the place, I think mentally, that he was in when he was in the mental institution. And <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> don't want that." ...|$|E
500|$|Barney was {{inspired}} by Barney Rubble, Fred Flintstone's best friend and next-door neighbor from the animated series The Flintstones. The writers originally wanted the character to be Homer Simpson's sidekick and next-door neighbor, but instead, while still portraying him as Homer's best friend, they decided to make him an alcoholic. Ned Flanders would become the next-door neighbor instead. [...] "Barney was taking the standard sitcom sidekick and just making him as pathetic as possible," [...] said Matt Groening, the creator of The Simpsons. The writers drew further inspiration from Crazy Guggenheim, a character played by comedian Frank Fontaine on The Jackie Gleason Show. Part of the reason the writers went in that direction, according to Groening, was because of [...] "a sort of unspoken rule about not having drinking on television {{as a source of}} comedy. So, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>we</b> went right for it." [...] The writers also patterned the character after Norm Peterson (George Wendt), a character from the sitcom Cheers.|$|E
500|$|Besides {{the above}} {{discussion}} about contributions and caveats, the summit was noticed to paint an optimistic {{picture of the}} war in Afghanistan and Afghanistan's future. For instance, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said that [...] "real progress" [...] had been made in Afghanistan and that this was the main highlight of the summit. He strongly disagreed with visions of [...] "doom and gloom," [...] and added that five years after the defeat of the Taliban regime, Afghanistan had become a democratic society that is [...] "no longer a threat to the world." [...] He also believed that the defeat of the insurgency {{was only a matter of}} time, stating that the war in Afghanistan [...] "is winnable, it is being won, but it is not yet won because, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>we</b> have many challenges in Afghanistan." [...] In his opinion, these challenges included besides military engagement mainly reconstruction and development work.|$|E
