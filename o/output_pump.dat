A neural network-based tool was developed for monitoring pump performance and aiding in predicting pump failure. Once trained, neural networks can rapidly process many combinations of input values other than those used for training to approximate previously unknown output values. This neural network was applied to establish relationships among the critical frequencies and aid in predicting failures.

40|$|In this paper, we prove {{theoretically}} {{that both}} the stimulated Stokes scattering and its reverse process can occur simultaneously for the light and acoustic waves at different points of the medium, resulting in transient and alternate energy flow between the pump and Stokes waves in the stimulated Brillouin scattering. Furthermore, {{it is found that}} stimulated Stokes scattering and its reverse process will dominate alternately on the whole during the three-wave coupling, but the eventual net energy flow must be from the pump wave to the Stokes wave {{as a result of the}} finite lifetime of acoustical phonons. It is also deduced that direction of energy flow between the pump and Stokes waves will turn to the opposite side once any one of the three waves experiences a π-phase shift. Consequently, we present that transient energy convection between the pump and Stokes waves can give rise to optical wave splitting for the <b>output</b> <b>pump</b> and Stokes pulses, and is also responsible for the generation of Brillouin solitons because energy reflux can provide additional dissipation for the Stokes and acoustic waves to achieve the gain-loss balance.

40|$|Background: Acardiac monochorionic twins lack cardiac {{function}} but grow by passive perfusion of {{the pump}} twin's deoxygenated arterial blood through placental arterioarterial (AA) and venovenous (VV) anastomoses and by hypoxia-mediated neovascularization. Pump twins therefore must continuously increase their cardiac output which may cause heart failure. Our aims were: to adapt our twin-twin transfusion syndrome model for acardiac twin pregnancies, to simulate pump and acardiac twin development, {{and to examine}} the model for early prognostic markers of pump twin survival. Methods: We used an infinite acardiac placental resistance, based on placental dye injection studies and simulations, suggesting the AA-Acardiac-VV series resistance determines the pump twin's excess cardiac <b>output.</b> <b>Pump</b> and acardiac development were expressed by the pump's excess cardiac output versus its normal value, represented by pump/acardiac umbilical venous diameter (UVD) ratios. Results: UVD ratios distinguish between AA-VV anastomoses that do and do not cause hydropic pump twins. Pump twins can handle relative larger acardiac perfusion at later than earlier gestation. Both VV and acardiac resistances are significantly smaller than the AA resistance, based on respectively clinical data and acardiac blood volumetric growth. Conclusion: Our simulations support clinical results which show that UVD ratios aid in the prediction of pump twin risk. The AA anastomosis controls the future of both the pump and the acardiac. Correlation between acardiac size and pump twin risk is secondary to the AA size but remains clinically usable. These factors may aid {{in the development of}} methods for pump twin prognosis and the promotion of selective clinical interventions...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} mutual {{influence}} between a continuous flow pump (CFP) and ventricular filling conditions {{by means of}} a circulatory model (CM). Methods & Materials: The lumped parameter CM includes both hearts, systemic and pulmonary circulation. The CFP (atrio-aortic connection) is represented by a computational sub-model relating pump pressure and flow. Experimental data were measured on a sheep implanted with an atrio-aortic CFP (CircuLite Synergy Micropump?). Experimental data (heart rate, aortic pressure, ventricular pressure, total cardiac <b>output,</b> <b>pump</b> flow, left ventricular volume) were used to feed the model and set its parameters using a recursive procedure. The model estimated ventricular Emax, ventricular filling stiffness (VS), systemic peripheral resistance, flow distribution between the left ventricle and the CFP. Starting from modelled CFP experimental data, VS was changed in steps from 0. 04 to 0. 5 mmHg cm- 3 to analyse its effects on flow distribution between the left ventricle and the CFP. Simulations were repeated for two pump speeds (PS= 20000 and 25000 RPM). Results: The model was able to reproduce experimental data used for model output verification. Errors were within 5 % for all hemodynamic variables. VS (0. 04 to 0. 5 mmHg cm- 3) affected flow distribution (expressed as ventricular flow/total flow) ranging from 94 % to 0. 39 % for PS= 20000 RPM and from 49 % to 0. 43 % for PS= 25000 RPM. Conclusions: The lower PS permits a better modulation of flow distribution with changing VS. Higher PS guarantees a better support independently of ventricular conditions. An accurate monitoring of ventricular conditions along with an appropriate pump speed modulation are necessary to optimise ventricular assistance effectiveness.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{investigate}} {{second harmonic generation}} (SHG) in nonlinear 1 dimensional (1 D) bilayer periodic photonic crystal with various microstructure designs. The transfer matrix is used to model propagation of fundamental field (FF) and second harmonic field inside photonic crystal and numerical simulations are studied. Firstly, {{we investigate}} SHG caused by interaction between continuous wave and dielectric magnetic photonic crystal. For nondispersive material, constant and real permittivity and permeability are used being good approximation for frequency {{far away from the}} resonant region. We find interesting features in the SH fields versus pump frequency and relative thickness of the bilayers for the same real value of permittivity and permeability but with different signs. Negative permeability is a substitute to periodical poling, giving stronger SH signal when one of the layers has negative refractive index. For certain parameters, backward and forward SH signals can be generated over a broad frequency range. For dispersive material, around resonant region, the FF spectra show more predictable features of bandgap and transparency windows. SH spectra show irregular patterns that depend on the magnetic and dielectric resonances of each layer. The results provide insights for designing efficient nonlinear photonics devices with dieletricmagnetic materials like efficient frequency converter. Secondly, ultrashort pulse propagation and SHG in photonic crystal with superconducting layer is studied by using a combination of Fourier transform and transfer matrix for arbitary pulse propagation. Two fluid model is used to describe electromagnetic propagation in the superconducting layer at nonzero temperature. The focus is on temperature dependence and negative index using superconducting layer and magnetic materials when the superconducting transition frequency is close the magnetic resonance. At low temperature, the superconducting layer provides higher SHG conversion efficiency. Interesting features observed include <b>output</b> <b>pump</b> and second harmonic pulses that could be strongly modulated with the transmitted pulses being delayed by slow light effect.
