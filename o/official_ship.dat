50|$|The {{ship was}} built by the St. Johns River Shipbuilding Company in its second year of operations, and was the seventh of the 82 such ships built by that yard. Laid down on 15 March 1943, she was {{launched}} on 15 June 1943, and completed on 29 July 1943, given the <b>official</b> <b>ship</b> number 243756, and named after General Richard Montgomery, an Ulster soldier who was killed during the American Revolution.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, West Haven {{observed}} the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution. During the year-long celebrations, {{the mayor and}} council passed numerous resolutions to encourage community involvement, including naming the <b>official</b> <b>ship</b> of West Haven—the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Edson (DD-946)—and the city's official flower, the daylily. Public schools included curriculum on the Constitution from K-12, and school children were released from class {{to participate in a}} Constitution Day parade up Campbell Avenue.|$|E
40|$|This {{study of}} Western Empire is {{split into two}} {{distinct}} parts: (1) historical research {{of the life of}} the vessel, relying on primary documents; and (2) analysis of the deep water survey data. The first part concentrates on the historical documents that constitute the history of Western Empire. The second part begins with a review of the tools and procedures used in performing the deep water survey. An analysis of the information that can be taken from such a study will follow, and it concludes with suggestions for remotely operated vehicle operators when performing an on-the-fly survey of shipwrecks in deep water. The <b>official</b> <b>ship</b> logs, crew agreements, and contemporary newspaper articles are used to recreate the life of Western Empire and shed light on a period in which wooden sailing ships were being displaced by iron ships and steam power. iv ACKNOWLEDGMENTS As much as I would like to accept the credit for every aspect of this thesis, there have been many people who have helped me both academically and personally.

40|$|Approved as a Wallops {{control center}} backup system, the Wallops Ship Surveillance Software is a day-of-launch risk {{analysis}} tool for spaceport activities. The system calculates impact probabilities and displays ship locations relative to boundary lines. It enables rapid analysis of possible flight paths to preclude {{the need to}} cancel launches and allow execution of launches in a timely manner. Its design is based on low-cost, large-customer- base elements including personal computers, the Windows operating system, C/C++ object-oriented software, and network interfaces. In conformance with the NASA software safety standard, the system is designed {{to ensure that it}} does not falsely report a safe-for-launch condition. To improve the current ship surveillance method, the system is designed to prevent delay of launch under a safe-for-launch condition. A single workstation is designated the controller of the <b>official</b> <b>ship</b> information and the official risk analysis. Copies of this information are shared with other networked workstations. The program design is divided into five subsystems areas: 1. Communication Link [...] threads that control the networking of workstations; 2. Contact List [...] a thread that controls a list of protected item (ocean vessel) information; 3. Hazard List [...] threads that control a list of hazardous item (debris) information and associated risk calculation information; 4. Display [...] threads that control operator inputs and screen display outputs; and 5. Archive [...] a thread that controls archive file read and write access. Currently, most of the hazard list thread and parts of other threads are being reused as part of a new ship surveillance system, under the SureTrak project...|$|E
40|$|To enable {{efficient}} management of inland navigation processes,specialized information systems should be developedthrough {{the application of}} modern information and communicationtechnology (ICT). For this purpose, individual Europeanwaterway and port authorities have developed their ownlocal information systems and databases. Due to the non-conformityof these databases, their integration at the Europeanlevel is confronted with selious problems (COMPRIS, 2003). One of the major problems {{is the lack of}} a common Europeanunique identification number for inland barges. For this reason,in some locally managed databases several different identificationnumbers are attributed to one and the same inlandbarge or certain identification numbers are not available. Thesame problem occurs in the communication between waterwayautholities and between waterway and port authorities. Therefore,a unique identification number for all floating objects onthe European waterways should be introduced. At the momentthere are only two official numbers for vessels. The first, the!MO number, introduced in 1978, is only used by maritimevessels. The second, the OFS number (<b>Official</b> <b>Ship</b> Number),is used only for vessels that have a Rhine patent (issued by theCCNR). The OFS number cannot satisfy all the requirementsof RIS Directive 2005 / 44 /EC and the amendment to Directive 82 / 714 /EEC on technical requirements for inland navigationvessels in the enlarged European Union. The fact is that only 20 % of the ranges of codes are reserved for the non-Rhinecountries. A special Electronic Reporting International group(ER!) was appointed to formulate a new system for uniqueidentification of inland vessels and also define a databasemodel for vessel characteristics. The initial suggestion of ERIwas to add one character in front of the OFS number in orderto increase its coding capacity. The intention was to make asfew as possible differences/modifications to the system currentlyused under the regime of the Rhine Vessel InspectionRegulations in order to minimize the administrative efforts ofharmonization. As members of the ER! group, we made a proposalfor such a new identification number (the so calledERN), which was discussed by the ERI expert group takinginto account the input from the Joint Working Group ofCCNR and EC. In this paper, we will desclibe our proposal toER!, which was later slightly modified within a special ER! expertgroup...|$|E

50|$|On 30 June 1900, {{after her}} fourth passage, the ship {{arrived at the}} HAPAG quay at Hoboken, New Jersey, where also the docks of Norddeutscher Lloyd were located. Her arrival coincided with the great fire of Hoboken during which many of NDL's ships were destroyed, among them SS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse, which was not {{completely}} burned but had suffered major damages. It was a tragic incident with many victims and enormous financial losses. During the fire, Kaiser Friedrich participated in several rescue operations rendering crucial assistance.

50|$|Tilefish {{departed}} Oahu on September 10, 1944. This patrol, {{conducted in}} the Sea of Okhotsk and off the Kuril Islands, was made difficult by rough seas which produced swells reaching heights of 30 to 40 feet (9 to 12 m). Despite the problems imposed by high seas, Tilefish sank a small trawler with her four inch (102 mm) gun on September 23. Early in October, she destroyed two small cargo vessels as they were leaving Hitokappu Bay of Iturup. During the mid-watch on 13 October, an adventurous owl came on board. The feathered seafarer was promptly dubbed Boris Hootski and made <b>official</b> <b>ship's</b> mascot. In the following days, Tilefish claimed two more kills—a cargo ship and a wooden-hulled antisubmarine vessel. On October 17, to prevent its being salvaged, she blew out the stern of a vessel grounded west of Japan's Shimushiru Island (today the Russian island Simushir). Tilefish ended her third patrol at Midway Island on October 24, 1944.|$|R

2500|$|On 10 May 1940, Nazi Germany invaded France and the Low Countries. The Blitzkrieg (Lightning War) tactics {{took the}} Western powers by surprise. By {{the time of}} the {{resignation}} of the French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud on 16 June, it was obvious that Germany victory in the Battle of France was inevitable. In the Channel Islands, civilians worried about the consequences of remaining on the Islands but, to avoid panic, were told by the authorities to stay put. Senior officials were ordered to stay in order to maintain order and to keep the Government functioning. On the 15 June, the British government decided to demilitarise the Islands, evacuating the British garrisons and leaving them undefended. The Germans were not informed however. [...] Evacuation boats for civilians only became available on 20 June and again, to stop a panic, people were still told to remain where they were and that only women and children should be taken. Only when the Lieutenant Governors of the islands evacuated were the recommendation relaxed. The last <b>official</b> <b>ships</b> sailed on 23 June.|$|R
50|$|In {{conjunction}} with Commander, Carrier Division Seven, Kitty Hawk carried out several exercises in January and February 1963. On 4 January 1963, Operation Checkertail saw Kitty Hawk {{and three other}} attack aircraft carriers launch practice airstrikes against the Okinawa Air Defense Command. From 27 January - 2 February 1963, 'Picture Window III' saw 'foreign aircraft' intercepted and visually identified in the Northern Japan area. Though the <b>official</b> <b>ship's</b> papers released in 2011 do not identify the nationality, {{it is likely that}} the 'foreign aircraft' in question were from the Soviet Far Eastern Military District or Soviet Naval Aviation. From 16-19 February 1963, Exercise 'Red Wheel,' was conducted around Southern Japan also under the direction of Commander, Carrier Division Seven. It aimed to improve the United States Seventh Fleet's ability to conduct conventional and nuclear warfare while maintaining defense against air and submarine attack. It also aimed to evaluate the capability of 'the HUK Hunter-Killer Group' to protect two CVA Task Groups. During these exercises, the ship visited Kobe, Beppu and Iwakuni before returning to San Diego on 2 April 1963.|$|R
