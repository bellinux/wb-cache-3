40|$|A {{computational}} study {{based on}} a front tracking method was conducted by solving an unsteady, axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equation to investigate the mixing efficiency between two colliding droplets subsequent to their merging. Results show that, for droplets of sufficiently dissimilar sizes, the smaller droplet would transform into a mushroom-shaped jet that penetrates into {{the interior of the}} larger droplet, and hence greatly facilitates mixing. The jet acquires its energy from the surface energy of the colliding interfaces that are eliminated upon merging. For droplets of similar sizes, jet formation is not favored due to symmetry, and the eliminated surface energy is rapidly dissipated through viscous action of the droplet internal motion. The results qualitatively agree well with previous experimental <b>observations.</b> <b>Department</b> of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|In this letter, we {{investigate}} the interlayer exchange coupling between two finitely thick ferromagnets (FM), {{separated by a}} non-metallic spacer, {{taking into account the}} contributions from double-well states. It is found that the negative temperature coefficient of the exchange coupling {{can be explained by the}} resonant tunnelling between two FM wells, whereas the positive temperature coefficient for the antiferromagnetic coupling can be attributed to non-resonant tunnelling. Our calculation of the electronic structure indicates that this temperature dependence is related to the relative magnitudes of the densities of states close to the Fermi surface for the cases of parallel and antiparallel alignments of the FMs. Also, the present model provides us with a new physical explanation for recent experimental <b>observations.</b> <b>Department</b> of Applied Physic...|$|R
40|$|The random {{nature of}} {{diffusing}} jumps and cascade occurrence produce stochastic fluctuations of the point-defect fluxes. The effect of such fluctuations on the kinetics of void growth is investigated {{in the present}} paper. It is found that the non-linear coupling between the stochastic fluctuations and the void sizes {{may lead to the}} instability of void evolution within the mean-field theory, when the sizes of voids and their growth rates are both relatively small. The growth rate of voids becomes dominated by the stochastic component, causing the smaller voids to shrink away. This effect is investigated in terms of a non-equilibrium phase transition induced by a purely random stochastic noise. The derived conditions for this non-equilibrium transition are compared favourably with experimental <b>observations.</b> <b>Department</b> of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|A sp 2 bonded {{boron nitride}} (sp 2 BN) surface layer is {{sometimes}} observed {{on top of}} cubic boron nitride (cBN) grains for BN films deposited using ion-assisted PVD techniques.

In the current study, the microstructure and phase composition near the top surface of several BN films were investigated in order to clarify the formation mechanism of such a surface layer. All the films investigated were synthesized using ion-assisted PVD techniques, but with different deposition parameters. It was found that such a surface layer is not necessarily present in some of the cBN growth, and its presence depends on the bombardment of ion energy during deposition. The cBN growth mechanisms are discussed based on these <b>observations.</b> <b>Department</b> of Applied Physic...|$|R
40|$|The {{observed}} tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) {{effect in}} La 0. 9 Ba 0. 1 MnO 3 (LBMO) /Nb-doped SrTiO 3 (Nb-STO) p+-n junctions is investigated {{and a possible}} mechanism responsible for the TMR generation is proposed by {{taking into account the}} dynamic spin accumulation and paramagnetic magnetization in the Nb-STO layer. Because of carrier diffusion across the dynamic domain boundaries in the Nb-STO layer and spin disordering in the LBMO layer, the tunneling resistance through the junction is high at zero magnetic field. The spin disordering is suppressed upon applying a non-zero magnetic field, which results in the spin-polarized tunneling in this ferromagnetic/depletion layer/dynamic ferromagnetic sandwiched structure and thus the observed TMR effect. The dependence of the TMR effect on the domain size in the LBMO layer, the tunneling current and temperature as well is explained, qualitatively consistent with the experimental <b>observation.</b> <b>Department</b> of Applied Physic...|$|E
40|$|Nucleation of voids via the {{stochastic}} {{accumulation of}} vacancies is considered when one-dimensionally migrating self-interstitials are present. A system instability signaling a non-equilibrium phase transition {{is found to}} occur when the mean free path of the one-dimensionally moving self-interstitials becomes comparable with the average distance between the voids at a sufficiently high void-number density. At this point, due to the exponential dependence of void nucleation probability on the net vacancy flux, the nucleation of voids is much more favored at the void lattice positions. At the same time, voids initially nucleated at positions where neighboring voids are non-aligned will shrink away. The shrinkage of non-aligned voids is caused entirely by the stochastic fluctuations in point-defect fluxes received by the voids. These two processes leave the aligned voids to form a regular lattice. The formation of the void lattice in this way can be accomplished at a void swelling of below 1 %, in agreement with experimental <b>observation.</b> <b>Department</b> of Electronic and Information Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} {{flow in the}} microcirculation is crucial to ensure blood supply to the tissues. The {{spontaneous}} time-dependent contraction and relaxation of small arteries and arterioles was observed 160 years ago and is termed as vasomotion. Vasomotion is an intrinsic phenomenon unrelated to cardiac rhythm or neural and hormonal regulation; and it works as a local control mechanism to regulate the microvascular blood flow. In spite of tremendous studies on vasomotion, the physiological role of vasomotion is not clear. Vasomotion results in the flow oscillation which is termed as flowmotion. The flowmotion is crucial for optimal blood flow and nutrient delivery in micro vasculature. Blood vessels in tumors are highly irregular and dense compared to those in normal tissue which may affect the flowmotion. As the first attempt, {{in this study we}} investigated the effect of irregular microvascular structure on flow delivery in microvascular bed with composite flow oscillating frequencies. The results showed that the irregular micro vasculature would decrease the flowmotion and lead to reduction of nutrient and drug delivery which is consistent with the experimental <b>observation.</b> <b>Department</b> of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|We have {{measured}} the effective viscosity of polystyrene films {{with a small}} (4 wt %) added amount of dioctyl phthalate (DOP) deposited on silica. A broad range of molecular weights, Mw, from 13. 7 to 2100 kg/mol was investigated. Our result shows that for the thin films with Mw < ∼ 100 kg/mol the addition of DOP causes the effective viscosity to decrease {{by a factor of}} ∼ 4, independent of Mw. But for the higher Mw films, the effective viscosity of the DOP added films creeps toward that of the neat films with increasing Mw. A model assuming the effective viscosity to be dominated by enhanced surface mobility for the lower Mw films but surface-promoted interfacial slippage for the higher Mw films is able to account for the experimental <b>observations.</b> <b>Department</b> of Applied Physic...|$|R
40|$|Open-graded {{friction}} course (OGFC) {{is often}} {{believed to have}} no contribution to the structural capacity of flexible pavement. In this study, five types of OGFC mixtures were prepared and tested for rutting potentials, and {{three of them were}} tested for dynamic moduli, which were further used to analyse pavement's response and performance based on the procedures in the mechanistic-empirical pavement design guide (MEPDG). It was found that the tensile strain at the bottom of asphalt concrete layers and the compressive strain at the top of sub-grade layer are sensitive to the availability of OGFC, regardless of mixture type. The fatigue and permanent deformation damages of a flexible pavement can be effectively reduced after adding the OGFC layer, due to the alteration of loading frequency, thermal gradient and modulus ratio.

The manipulated flow was measured at a Reynolds number (Re) of 7, 400 using particle image velocimetry (PIV), laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) flow visualisation, two-component laser Doppler anemometry (LDA), hot wires and load cells. It is {{observed that the}} vortex circulation, fluctuating streamwise velocity, lift and drag coefficients and mean drag coefficient may decrease by 71 %, 40 %, 51 %, 42 % and 20 %, respectively, compared with the unperturbed flow, if the perturbation velocity of the cylinder surface is anti-phased with the flow lateral velocity associated with vortex shedding. On the other hand, these quantities may increase by 152 %, 90 %, 60 %, 67 % and 37 %, respectively, given in-phased cylinder surface perturbation and vortex shedding.

To induce the piezoelectric β-phase crystal structure, the nanocomposite films were drawn to 400 %– 500 % elongation and polarized with a step-wise poling method. To evaluate the piezoelectric properties, the output voltages of the nanocomposite films were measured through extensive experimental vibration tests. The experimental {{results show that the}} nanocomposite film with 0. 05 wt% MWCNT loading possesses the highest output voltage, around two times higher than that of pure PVDF film, as compared to the other loadings. The main reason for this phenomenon is that more β-crystalline phase can be formed at this MWCNT loading, as confirmed by x-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectral analysis and polarized optical microscopy <b>observations.</b> <b>Department</b> of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

A simple chromophore correlation model is proposed to explain the self healing mechanism. Based on observations that the molecules are photoresistant at high dye concentration and low temperature, we propose that molecules form correlated regions that are resistant to damage and promote self-healing. We have developed a simple model for photodegradation and recovery that depends on three parameters: the intensity-dependent decay rate, the recovery rate, and the free energy advantage for a molecule being in a correlated group, which we call a domain. This model accounts for all observations of ASE and absorption spectroscopy of DO 11 dye in PMMA as a function of time, pump intensity, and concentration during decay and recovery with one fixed set of theses three parameters.
