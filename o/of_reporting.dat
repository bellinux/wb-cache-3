5|$|According to Schultheiss, Herrmann, and Jonas, {{although}} Trousseau {{had earlier}} suggested that surgery was a viable option, {{there is no}} evidence that the subject subsequently received treatment; They suggest several possible factors, including legal issues, the subject's refusal, or failed treatment followed by a lack <b>of</b> <b>reporting,</b> for the lack of surgery or evidence of such.

40|$|Context: Poorly written {{radiology}} {{reports are}} common among residents {{and are a}} significant challenge for radiology education. While training may improve report quality, a professionally developed reliable and valid scale to measure report quality does not exist. Objectives: To develop a measurement tool for report quality, the quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale, with rigorous validation through empirical data. Methods: A research team of an experienced psychometrician and six senior radiologists conducted qualitative and quantitative studies. Five items were identified for the quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale, each measuring a distinct aspect <b>of</b> <b>report</b> quality. Two dedicated training sessions were designed and implemented to help residents generate high-quality reports. In a blinded fashion, the quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale was applied to 804 randomly selected reports issued before (n[*]=[*] 403) and after (n[*]=[*] 401) training. Full-scale psychometrical assessments were implemented onto the quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale’s item- and scale-scores from the <b>reports.</b> The quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale scores were correlated with report professionalism and attendings’ preference and were compared pre-/post-training. Results: The quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale showed sound psychometrical properties, with high validity and reliability. Reports with higher quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale score were more professional and preferable by attendings. Training improved the quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale score, empirically validating the quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale further. Conclusion: While succinct and practitioner friendly, the quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale is a reliable and valid measure <b>of</b> radiology <b>report</b> quality and {{has the potential to}} be easily adapted to other fields such as pathology, where similar training would be beneficial...|$|R

5|$|Contrasting Bogaert's 1% figure, a {{study by}} Aicken et al., {{published}} in 2013, suggests that, based on Natsal-2 data from 2000-2001, the prevalence of asexuality in Britain is only 0.4% for people {{between the ages of}} 16-44. This percentage indicates a decrease from the 0.9% figure determined from the Natsal-1 data collected on the same age-range a decade earlier. A 2015 analysis by Bogaert also found a similar decline between the Natsal-1 and Natsal-2 data. Aicken, Mercer, and Cassell found some evidence of ethnic differences among respondents who had not experienced sexual attraction; both men and women of Indian and Pakistani origin had a higher likelihood <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> a lack of sexual attraction.

5|$|Most policy analysts (on {{both right}} and left) were {{critical}} of the employer mandate provision.

40|$|Purpose. Aim of {{the study}} is {{to get a better view}} of the {{contribution}} of pharmacists to the quantity and the quality <b>of</b> <b>reports</b> and in this way to the quality <b>of</b> a voluntary <b>reporting</b> system <b>of</b> adverse drug reactions. Methods. 15, 293 reports, sent to the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Foundation Lareb between 1995 and 2000 were analysed for the characteristics <b>of</b> pharmacists' <b>reports</b> and the differences with <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> physicians. Dispersion of adverse drug reaction was related to the different System and Organ Classes, the seriousness <b>of</b> the <b>reports</b> according to the CIOMS criteria and the documentation grade <b>of</b> the <b>reports.</b> 200 reports were at random selected and their quality assessed for the quality <b>of</b> the <b>reports.</b> Results. Pharmacists are responsible for 40 % <b>of</b> the <b>reports</b> sent in to Lareb during this period. Their reports more frequently concern adverse effects in relation to skin and the eyes. The seriousness <b>of</b> pharmacists' <b>reports</b> is less than with physician's reports as is the case with the documentation grade <b>of</b> <b>reports.</b> The quality <b>of</b> the clinical information <b>of</b> physicians' <b>reports</b> is higher. Conclusions. The contribution of pharmacists in the voluntary reporting system in the Netherlands is of great importance, both for the number <b>of</b> <b>reports</b> and the quality <b>of</b> <b>reports...</b>|$|R
5|$|During the night, {{three of}} the militia's horses wandered off; the next day, June 25, three men {{went in search of}} the animals while the rest stayed behind. At the cabin, seven Native American braves {{appeared}} in the distance. The troops immediately began pursuing the natives, who fled into the woods, instead <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> the sighting to Dement. The Native American warriors, as had been done other times {{during the course of the}} war, set an ambush for the militia men in the forest. The militia pursued the natives into the woods and, as they entered the forest, the natives opened fire, the volley instantly killed two militia men and wounded another. The militia retreated and formed a battle line but the native forces would not relent. The rest of Dement's company attempted to rescue the outmatched militia men but were unable to beat back the native warriors. Black Hawk's band attacked the militia men, again forcing the beleaguered force to fall back to the Kellogg cabin and barn.|$|E
5|$|On 8 February 1963, the Iraqi Regional Branch, led by Ali Salih al-Sa'di, {{took power}} in Iraq by overthrowing Abd al-Karim Qasim. He {{was a far}} more {{formidable}} opponent than al-Kudsi, and the Iraqi Regional Branch managed to take power through an alliance not only with military officers, but also with segments of the middle class. Qasim's downfall changed the rules of Arab politics – the Nasserists had monopolised the Arab nationalist movement since the UAR, but the takeover made the Ba'ath Party {{a force to be}} reckoned with. In contrast to the Iraqi regional branch, the Syrian regional branch did not have mass support or a significant support base in the middle class. While Aflaq cautioned the plotters because of the party's lack of support, they failed to share his worries, and launched the coup on 7 March. However, that day the military intelligence raided the apartment where the plotters were planning to assemble. Assad was given the task <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> to other units that the coup had been postponed to 8 March.|$|E
5|$|The third {{source of}} over-provisioning comes from known free {{space on the}} drive, gaining {{endurance}} and performance at the expense <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> unused portions, and/or {{at the expense of}} current or future capacity. This free space can be identified by the operating system using the TRIM command. Alternately, some SSDs provide a utility that permit the end user to select additional over-provisioning. Furthermore, if any SSD is set up with an overall partitioning layout smaller than 100% of the available space, that unpartitioned space will be automatically used by the SSD as over-provisioning as well. Yet another source of over-provisioning is operating system minimum free space limits; some operating systems maintain a certain minimum free space per drive, particularly on the boot or main drive. If this additional space can be identified by the SSD, perhaps through continuous usage of the TRIM command, then this acts as semi-permanent over-provisioning. Over-provisioning often takes away from user capacity, either temporarily or permanently, but it gives back reduced write amplification, increased endurance, and increased performance.|$|E
