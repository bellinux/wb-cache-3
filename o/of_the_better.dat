Many reviewers have praised the game for making noticeable improvements over Zelda, but various shortcomings – which include long passwords, repetitive gameplay, and poor collision detection – prevent the game from being superior over the 1986 Nintendo title. But overall, reviewers have called Neutopia one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> video games of its type and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> titles in the TurboGrafx-16 library. There would eventually be a sequel to the game NeutopiaII, in which Jazeta disappears and his son sets out to find him.|$|E

5|$|A 2004 {{article in}} USA Today {{suggested}} that playing Magic might help improve {{the social and}} mental skills {{of some of the}} players. The article interviewed players' parents who believe that the game, similar to sports, teaches children how to more gracefully win and lose. Magic also contains a great amount of strategy and vocabulary that children may not be exposed to on a regular basis. Parents also claimed that playing Magic helped keep their children out of trouble, such as using illegal drugs or joining criminal gangs.
