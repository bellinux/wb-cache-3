5|$|English was the <b>official</b> <b>language</b> of Sarawak from 1963 to 1974 due to {{opposition}} from First Chief Minister of Sarawak Stephen Kalong Ningkan {{to the use}} of the Malay language in Sarawak. In 1974 the new Chief Minister Abdul Rahman Ya'kub recognised Malay alongside English as an <b>official</b> <b>language</b> of Sarawak. This new status given to the Malay language was further reinforced by new education standards transitioning curriculum to Malay. In 1985 English lost the status of an <b>official</b> <b>language,</b> leaving only Malay. Despite official policy, Sarawak opposition members argue that English remained the de facto <b>official</b> <b>language</b> of Sarawak. English is still spoken in the legal courts, and state legislative assembly. In 2015, Chief Minister Adenan Satem announced that English will be reinstated as an <b>official</b> <b>language.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{adoption}} of an <b>official</b> <b>language</b> for the Indian Republic was a hotly debated issue during the framing of the Indian Constitution after India's {{independence from the}} United Kingdom. After an exhaustive and divisive debate, Hindi was adopted as the <b>official</b> <b>language</b> of India with English continuing as an associate <b>official</b> <b>language</b> {{for a period of}} fifteen years, after which Hindi would become the sole <b>official</b> <b>language.</b> The new Constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950. Efforts by the Indian Government to make Hindi the sole <b>official</b> <b>language</b> after 1965 were not acceptable to many non-Hindi Indian states, who wanted the continued use of English. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a descendant of Dravidar Kazhagam, led the opposition to Hindi. To allay their fears, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru enacted the Official Languages Act in 1963 to ensure the continuing use of English beyond 1965. The text of the Act did not satisfy the DMK and increased their skepticism that his assurances might not be honoured by future administrations.|$|E

5|$|Although French is an <b>official</b> <b>language</b> for the {{purposes}} of the legislature, legislation, and the courts, the Manitoba Act does not require it to be an <b>official</b> <b>language</b> for the purpose of the executive branch (except when performing legislative or judicial functions).
