5|$|Feminist views <b>of</b> <b>pornography</b> {{range from}} {{condemnation}} <b>of</b> <b>pornography</b> {{as a form}} of violence against women, to an embracing of some forms <b>of</b> <b>pornography</b> as a medium of feminist expression. Feminists' views on prostitution vary, but many of these perspectives can be loosely arranged into an overarching standpoint that is generally either critical or supportive of prostitution and sex work.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} critical {{success was}} The Year of the Sex Olympics, broadcast {{as part of}} BBC2's Theatre 625 series in July 1968. Kneale's first television work {{to be made in}} colour—although only a black-and-white copy now survives—the story was based in a future where {{the majority of the population}} are kept in a docile state by constant broadcasts <b>of</b> <b>pornography</b> and other low-brow reality television programming. The Live Life Show, in which a family are watched twenty-four hours a day as they struggle to live on an isolated rural island, becomes a massive success, especially when a murderer is introduced into the set-up.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Rita Dworkin (September 26, 1946– April 9, 2005) was an American radical {{feminist and}} writer {{best known for}} her {{criticism}} <b>of</b> <b>pornography,</b> which she argued was linked to rape and other forms of violence against women. Her views were widely criticized by liberal feminists and others. At the same time, she maintained a dialogue with political conservatives, and wrote a topically-related book, Right-Wing Women. After suffering abuse from her first husband, she was introduced to radical feminist literature, and began writing Woman Hating. Coming to New York, she became an activist on several issues and a writer, eventually publishing 10 books on feminism.|$|E
50|$|The law in Belize {{does not}} {{prohibit}} the simple possession <b>of</b> child <b>pornography.</b> It is unclear if distribution <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> is illegal.|$|R
50|$|Pornography {{is illegal}} in Nigeria, however the {{regulation}} <b>of</b> Internet <b>pornography</b> is light. Nigeria {{has the highest}} number <b>of</b> Internet <b>pornography</b> viewers than any country in Africa.|$|R
40|$|Most child {{pornography}} is distributed online. It {{is estimated that}} 3 % to 15 % <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> consumers are juveniles. The present study analyzed a consecutive sample of 54 male juveniles convicted of the possession <b>of</b> child <b>pornography.</b> Demographic characteristics, criminal history, and subsequent offending were assessed from criminal files and official reports. Juvenile possessors <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> were compared to three different groups of juveniles: Juvenile possessors <b>of</b> other illegal <b>pornography</b> (n = 42), juveniles who committed a sexual contact offense against a child (n = 64), and juveniles who committed a sexual contact offense against a peer or adult (n = 104). Juvenile possessors <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> {{were found to have}} downloaded the illegal material more frequently and over a longer time period than juvenile possessors <b>of</b> other illegal <b>pornography.</b> Furthermore, juvenile possessors <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> differed from juveniles who had committed a sexual contact offense in terms of demographics and showed fewer previous and subsequent offending than juveniles who sexually offended against a peer or adult. We conclude that juvenile possessors <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> need a specific target intervention focusing on dysfunctional Internet use and sexually deviant arousal...|$|R
5|$|Gov. Schwarzenegger again {{appealed to}} the Supreme Court, looking to {{overturn}} the Ninth Circuit's ruling, filing a writ of certiorari to the Court in May 2009. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, at this point filed as Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n. The fact that the Court accepted this case was considered surprising, based on the previous case record for such violent video game laws that were unanimously overturned in other states. Analysts believe that because the Court agreed to hear this case, there are unanswered questions between the protection of free speech from the First Amendment, and the legal enforcement of protecting minors from unprotected free speech such as through restrictions on the sales <b>of</b> <b>pornography</b> to minors. Just a week prior to {{the acceptance of the}} certiorari, in United States v. Stevens the Court overturned another law that sought restrictions on depictions of animal cruelty, which some analysts felt would reflect the Court's position to likely overturn the violent video game law.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Dershowitz {{handled the}} {{successful}} appeal of Harry Reems, {{who had been}} convicted of distribution of obscenity resulting from his acting in the pornographic movie Deep Throat. In public debates, Dershowitz commonly argues against censorship <b>of</b> <b>pornography</b> on First Amendment grounds, and maintains that consumption <b>of</b> <b>pornography</b> is not harmful.|$|E
25|$|Attempts made to {{suppress}} it include: outright bans, prohibitions of its sale, censorship or rating schemes that restrict audience numbers, and {{claims that it}} is prostitution and thereby subject to regulations governing prostitution. Legal decisions affecting production and consumption <b>of</b> <b>pornography</b> include those relating to its definition, its relationship with prostitution, the definition of obscenity, rulings about personal possession <b>of</b> <b>pornography,</b> and its standing in relation to freedom of expression rights.|$|E
50|$|On Aug. 8, 2017, Romanek {{was found}} guilty of felony {{possession}} <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> but not guilty of distribution <b>of</b> child <b>pornography.</b> Romanek's sentencing hearing is scheduled for Oct. 19, 2017.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} clarify the concept <b>of</b> revenge <b>pornography.</b> Existing laws {{concerning}} revenge pornography are analysed and sorted into four separate categories, after which a definition <b>of</b> (consensual) <b>pornography</b> is set out against definitions of four types <b>of</b> nonconsensual <b>pornography,</b> among which a definition <b>of</b> revenge <b>pornography.</b> This is followed by {{an analysis of the}} reasons for the lack of appropriate laws against revenge pornography and considers degrees of privacy. The discussion of the harms for victims will be followed by the identification of three kinds of wrongs and the identification of three kinds of perpetrators...|$|R
50|$|The law in Kazakhstan {{does not}} {{prohibit}} the simple possession <b>of</b> child <b>pornography.</b> In 2010, the government introduced a criminal statute {{on the production}} and distribution <b>of</b> child <b>pornography.</b> Those convicted face administrative penalties.|$|R
25|$|The Catholic Church disapproves <b>of</b> <b>pornography</b> {{and says}} that civil {{authorities}} should prevent the production and distribution of pornographic materials.|$|E
25|$|A Member of Parliament from Denmark {{translated}} the thesis into Danish; and the translation {{laid the foundation}} for the legalisation <b>of</b> <b>pornography</b> in Denmark on 4 June 1969.|$|E
25|$|Soviet law {{prohibited}} {{the creation and}} distribution <b>of</b> <b>pornography</b> under Article 228 of the criminal code of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and analogous legislation adopted by other republics of the Soviet Union.|$|E
40|$|The {{internet}} {{has opened up}} opportunities for non-contact sex offending, such as the viewing <b>of</b> child <b>pornography.</b> This paper proposes {{a model for the}} classification <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> offenders as an aid for their assessment and treatment, deducted from empirical studies and existing typologies for child pornography offenders. Different subgroups <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> offenders may be described according to three dimensions: (1) type of offending, (2) the motivation behind child pornography offending and (3) the situational and social engagement in the offending behaviour. Distinct pathways <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> offending can be identified, related to differing criminogenic needs, severity of offending, and appropriate assessment and treatment strategies for the offenders...|$|R
25|$|Digital {{cameras and}} Internet {{distribution}} {{facilitated by the}} use of credit cards and the ease of transferring images across national borders has made it easier than ever before for users <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> to obtain the photographs and videos. The NCMEC estimated in 2003 that 20% <b>of</b> all <b>pornography</b> traded over the Internet was child pornography, and that since 1997 the number <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> images available on the Internet had increased by 1500%.|$|R
5000|$|Producers and {{distributors}} <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> are punished with imprisonment {{from six to}} twelve years, and with a fine ranging from 25.822 to 258.228 Euros. Possession <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> is punished with imprisonment up to three years, and with a minimum fine of 1500 Euros (Codice penale, Article 600 ter, paragraph 5); sentences can be doubled or tripled if the quantity <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> found in possession of the culprit is [...] "vast".|$|R
25|$|Pornography that {{includes}} any participants being beneath the Irish age of consent is strictly illegal. This includes videos, DVD, film, photographs, digital files, drawings and text descriptions. There {{are no other}} laws banning specific types <b>of</b> <b>pornography</b> in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Another early form <b>of</b> <b>pornography</b> were {{comic books}} known as Tijuana bibles that began {{appearing}} in the U.S. in the 1920s and lasted until the publishing of glossy colour men's magazines commenced. These were crude hand drawn scenes often using popular characters from cartoons and culture.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Singular, {{author of}} the book Presumed Guilty: An Investigation into the JonBenét Ramsey Case, the Media and the Culture <b>of</b> <b>Pornography,</b> refers to {{consultations}} with cyber-crime specialists who believe that JonBenét, due to her beauty pageant experience, could have attracted the attention of child pornographers and pedophiles.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> {{seized in}} the United States is not produced or distributed for profit, {{and there is}} little evidence that organized criminals operating with a profit motivation are a major source <b>of</b> child <b>pornography's</b> international dissemination.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, the {{new owner}} of Reardon's former home {{discovered}} a cache <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> hidden behind a false wall.

50|$|The production, distribution, import, or export <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> {{is illegal}} in Thailand and {{punishable}} by {{a maximum of}} 3 {{years in prison and}} a fine not more than 6,000 baht. Possession <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> is illegal since 8 December 2015.|$|R
25|$|The {{church has}} always been against the creation, {{distribution}} and viewing <b>of</b> <b>pornography.</b> Gordon B. Hinckley had been known to say that pornography is as addictive as the worst drugs. He often talked of what a shame it is to use such great resources (such as the internet) for such material.|$|E
25|$|In February 2007, she {{appeared}} on The Tyra Banks Show, discussing teenagers {{in the sex}} industry. There was speculation that the show was heavily manipulated through editing, and did not include her defense <b>of</b> <b>pornography</b> as a career choice. The show was also criticized for doing this to increase its dramatic value.|$|E
25|$|In {{his later}} years Lucas cut his {{domestic}} ties and lived alone, spending his evenings in restaurants and clubs, and developing a wide collection <b>of</b> <b>pornography.</b> He {{was a member of}} the Athenæum, Beefsteak, Buck's and the Garrick. When he was stricken with his final illness he steadfastly refused to allow his friends into his sickroom.|$|E
50|$|Under Finnish law, it {{is illegal}} to possess, produce or {{distribute}} child <b>pornography.</b> Possession <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> is punishable by fine or imprisonment of one year while production or distribution <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> is punishable by fine or two years imprisonment.|$|R

50|$|Cohen {{was indicted}} for {{official}} misconduct (2nd degree), reproduction <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> (2nd degree), distribution <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> (2nd degree), and possession <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> (4th degree). In a plea agreement, the state dropped the official misconduct charge and three <b>of</b> four child <b>pornography</b> counts, and on April 12, 2010, Cohen {{pleaded guilty to}} the charge of endangering the welfare of a child by distributing child pornography. Initially facing up to 30 years imprisonment, State Attorney General Paula Dow sought a five-year prison term for Cohen, as well his disbarment. He was incarcerated from November 4, 2010 until January 4, 2012, when he was released on parole.|$|R
25|$|Over the years, he {{also created}} a number of volumes of animal, insect, and nature studies and shunga, or erotica. Shunga prints were quite {{acceptable}} in Japanese culture, not associated with a negative concept <b>of</b> <b>pornography</b> as found in western cultures, but considered rather as a natural aspect of human behavior and circulated among all levels of Japanese society.|$|E
25|$|Since the mid-1990s, {{the trend}} has {{withered}} with the shrinking of the general Hong Kong film market and the wider availability <b>of</b> <b>pornography</b> in home video formats (Bordwell, 2000). But in 2000s, three Category III movies: Election, its sequel, Election 2 (a.k.a. Triad Election), and Mad Detective, all directed by Johnnie To, still enjoyed surprising box office successes in Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|Although the 1857 and 1959 {{legislation}} outlawed the publication, {{retail and}} trafficking of certain writings and images, regarded as pornographic, and would order {{the destruction of}} shop and warehouse stock meant for sale, the private possession of and viewing <b>of</b> <b>pornography</b> has not been prosecuted until recent times. In some nations, even purely textual erotic literature is still deemed illegal and is also prosecuted.|$|E
40|$|Appellant {{was convicted}} of 15 counts <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> under NRS 200. 730. Appellant contested 14 of the 15 charges, arguing that his {{possession}} of 15 images <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> constituted only one violation. The Court agreed and determined that prosecuting each image or depiction <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> as a separate charge under NRS 200. 730 {{is not what the}} legislature intended. The statute should not be read to charge each “possession” as one violation. The Court reversed 14 of the charges...|$|R
40|$|Over recent years, {{offences}} {{related to}} the production, possession and distribution <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> have assumed great prominence. Public attention has focused on these crimes as being particularly repellent and deserving of both proactive policing and, when detected, full and extensive investigation. Increased awareness of the problem <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> {{has been associated with}} a parallel recognition of the significance of the Internet as a medium for the distribution <b>of</b> both child <b>pornography</b> and the facilitation and propagation of a number of sexual offences against children. Most European countries have statutes that criminalise possession <b>of</b> child <b>pornography,</b> and it is now regar-ded as a serious offence in most jurisdictions, attracting significant sentences on conviction. Because of its emotive nature and also because possession is, in the main, illegal, research into child pornography has been limited. Little is known about the nature and extent <b>of</b> child <b>pornography</b> precisel...|$|R
