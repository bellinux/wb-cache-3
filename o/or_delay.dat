Additionally, the typhoon caused the cancellation <b>or</b> <b>delay</b> of several flights {{in and out of}} Taipei, though complete air service was restored by the day after Matsa's passage. The Taiwan Stock Exchange closed due to the threat of the typhoon.|$|E

5|$|The IDF command {{did not see}} {{the forces}} in the western Negev as {{sufficient}} to fully stop an Egyptian invasion, wherever it was headed, and ordered an operation to stop <b>or</b> <b>delay</b> the advancing column. The command also feared that the Arab forces would try to create facts on the ground before the impending UN-imposed ceasefire. The two Arab forces that were considered a threat were the Iraqis in the Triangle (Jenin–Nablus–Tulkarm) and the Egyptians at Majdal–Isdud. Thus, Golani and Carmeli were to attack Jenin, Alexandroni was to harass Tulkarm, and Givati was to attack Isdud.|$|E
5|$|In early 1965, Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon {{wrote to}} President Lyndon Johnson, {{opposing}} the dollar and {{pointing out that}} the coins would be unlikely to circulate in Montana or anywhere else; they would simply be hoarded. Nevertheless, Dillon concluded that as Senator Mansfield insisted, the coins would have to be struck. Dillon resigned on April 1; his successor, Henry H. Fowler, was immediately questioned by Mansfield about the dollars, and he assured the senator that things would be worked out to his satisfaction. Mint Director Eva Adams hoped to avoid striking the silver dollars, but wanted to keep the $600,000 appropriated for that expense. Senator Mansfield refused to consider any cancellation <b>or</b> <b>delay</b> and on May 12, 1965, the Denver Mint began trial strikes of the 1964-D Peace dollar—the Mint had obtained congressional authorization to continue striking 1964-dated coins into 1965.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the typhoon, {{officials}} in China ordered the evacuation of about 2.3million people, mostly in Zhejiang. The typhoon also resulted in the cancellation <b>or</b> <b>delay</b> of thousands of flights, with the two main airports in Shanghai closed for 30hours. Officials near Matsa's projected landfall were advised to lower the levels in reservoirs to mitigate the threat of flooding. In Zhejiang, officials set up shelters for about 35,000 boats to prevent marine damage. Due to the potential for rough seas, officials closed the port at Ningbo and Shanghai and also canceled some ferry service. Matsa was predicted to be first typhoon to affect Beijing in 11years by dropping heavy amounts of rainfall. Local officials advised water operators to lower water levels to prevent flooding. Up to 100mm (4in) of rainfall was forecast for the city, and officials prepared to evacuate 40,000residents in the outskirts of the city.|$|E

5|$|The Bermuda Electric Light Company Limited {{recommended}} Bermuda {{residents to}} buy hurricane supplies such as candles, batteries, and non-perishable foods, to fill bathtubs and extra containers with water, and fill gasoline tanks for automobiles. In preparation, residents formed long lines at gas stations, banks, and supermarkets. All government offices and many businesses {{closed on the}} day prior to the hurricane hitting. All schools were closed, while all flights {{in and out of}} the island were canceled. Officials opened emergency shelters, and recommended 2,000 low-lying residents to evacuate; a hotel on the south shore of the island was evacuated as well. Several cruise ships expected to remain on the island departed early to avoid the hurricane. Local insurance companies on Bermuda experienced a great increase in business, as residents renewed lapsed policies or signed up for new policies for homes or businesses, though marine policies were stopped several days before the hurricane struck. The arrival of Fabian forced the cancellation <b>or</b> <b>delay</b> of several sports events, including a cricket match, a football game, and a dinghy race.|$|E
