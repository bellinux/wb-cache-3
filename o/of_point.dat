5|$|Due to the {{prevailing}} sea-breezes and long north-south ridge, Point Loma was a well-known gliding site during 1929-1935. William Hawley Bowlus the Superintendent of Construction on the Spirit of St. Louis and resident <b>of</b> <b>Point</b> Loma built the first American sailplane the Bowlus SP-1 and flew that aircraft along the west side <b>of</b> <b>Point</b> Loma to establish new American endurance records. Bowlus later used other refined designs to soar for over 9 hours near the Cabrillo National Monument, and one of Bowlus' students Jack C. Barstow soared over Point Loma for over 15 hours in 1930 to establish an unofficial world record for soaring endurance.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 November, with the Whaling Group {{covering}} their flank, the men of 2/5 marched north and reached the coast west <b>of</b> <b>Point</b> Cruz, completing the encirclement of the Japanese defenders. The Japanese defenses were centered in a draw between a coastal trail and a beach just west <b>of</b> <b>Point</b> Cruz and included coral, earth, and log bunkers as well as caves and foxholes. U.S. artillery bombarded the Japanese positions throughout the day on 2 November, causing {{an unknown number of}} casualties to the Japanese defenders.|$|E

5|$|The route {{began at}} a {{turnaround}} {{next to the}} Old Point Loma Lighthouse in the Cabrillo National Monument, near the southern tip <b>of</b> <b>Point</b> Loma.

SR209 passed through this residential neighborhood and provided access to Point Loma Nazarene University. The SR209 designation then made a right turn onto Cañon Street, curved to the southeast, and went downhill to the bayside location of the old La Playa Trail. At the intersection with Rosecrans Street, the designation made a turn to the northeast at a right angle onto Rosecrans.|$|E

The U.S. Army built a military road connecting Fort Steilacoom to Fort Bellingham, crossing the Stillaguamish River near the confluence.|$|E

As a consequence, any daughter B cells will acquire slight amino acid differences in the variable domains of their antibody chains.|$|E
