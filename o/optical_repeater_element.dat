In this paper, we report on our investigation of bandwidth efficiency and the associated service outage performance for different relay scenarios, using system level simulation for a cellular Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access-Time Division Duplexing (OFDMA-TDD) system. We have demonstrated that network throughput gain by typical <b>optical</b> <b>repeaters,</b> which have a simple amplify-and-forwarding capability in a full-duplexing mode, could be minimal in open space subject to cochannel interference from all repeaters in the neighboring cells.

30|$|The {{benefits}} of introducing the MR into the field, compared to conventional <b>optical</b> <b>repeaters</b> in a cellular system, include easy network deployment {{and a significant}} reduction in infrastructure cost by replacing the wireline relay link with wireless hops using the same frequency assignment (FA) as the access link. Furthermore, throughput and capacity enhancement can be achieved through the frequency-reuse capabilities of relay stations (RSs). As opposed to the selective decode-and-forward capability of the MR, the typical optical relays may suffer from a serious problem of co-channel interference between them in the neighboring cells as a consequence of their performing a simple (yet blind) amplify-and-forwarding function. When a universal frequency reuse is employed, this particular problem becomes more serious for OFDMA. OFDMA is less robust to co-channel interference compared to (code division multiple access) CDMA. However, a portion of the radio resource must be dedicated to the relay link in a MR system; this naturally reduces the capacity of its access link. This particular aspect becomes critical as the number of relay stations connected to the base station (MR-BS) increases. That is, there exists an obvious trade-off between the frequency reuse gain and capacity loss associated with the additional links between the MR-BSs and RSs.|$|R
30|$|Conventional {{repeaters}} incur serious C/I degradation in {{the open}} space for all the MSs throughout the cell coverage. This is due to other cell interference caused by all repeaters in the neighboring cells, {{even though they may}} be useful for warranting the outage performance with a multiple order of combining gain, especially in the destructive area, for example, basement or indoor with heavy wall attenuation that naturally shields the interference. However, intelligence of selective amplify-and-forwarding must be incorporated into the repeater with a reasonable complexity to ensure the usability of repeaters in the cellular OFDMA system with the adaptive modulation and coding scheme. This implies that flexibility and low-cost deployment with the MultiHop relay stations are additional advantages over the <b>optical</b> <b>repeaters</b> for the emerging mobile broadband wireless network. This is especially true when adopting the OFDMA as a new multiple access option for the 3 GPP Long-term Evolution (LTE), 3 GPP Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB), and Mobile WiMAX, which is less robust to the co-channel interference compared to the (code division multiple access) CDMA. It is perceived that the MultiHop relay capability {{is one of the most}} realistic means of achieving the target bandwidth efficiency requirement, currently discussed for IMT-Advanced in ITU-R WP 5 D standardization activities.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{experimental}} results for monitoring long distance WDM communication links using a line monitoring system suitable for legacy optically amplified long-haul undersea systems. This monitoring system {{is based on}} setting up a simple, passive, low cost high-loss optical loopback circuit at each repeater that provides {{a connection between the}} existing anti-directional undersea fibres, and can be used to define fault location. Fault location is achieved by transmitting a short pulse supervisory signal along with the WDM data signals where a portion of the overall signal is attenuated and returned to the transmit terminal by the loopback circuit. A special receiver is used at the terminal to extract the weakly returned supervisory signal where each supervisory signal is received at different times corresponding to different <b>optical</b> <b>repeaters.</b> Therefore, the degradation in any repeater appears on its corresponding supervisory signal level. We use a recirculating loop to simulate a 4600 km fibre link, on which a high-loss loopback supervisory system is implemented. Successful monitoring is accomplished through the production of an appropriate supervisory signal at the terminal that is detected and identified in a satisfactory time period after passing through up to 45 dB attenuation in the loopback circuit. © 2012 Elsevier B.

30|$|In this paper, we {{compared}} {{the performance of a}} cellular OFDMA-TDD system enhanced with a MultiHop relay or <b>optical</b> <b>repeater.</b> In particular, we investigated bandwidth efficiency gained by a frequency reuse feature of a MultiHop relay along with outage performance subject to the co-channel interference under different resource allocation scenarios. In general, system throughput of the conventional IEEE 802.16 e mobile wireless broadband system can be significantly enhanced by either a MultiHop relay or repeaters. Furthermore, outage performance can be improved by repeaters or MultiHop relays with orthogonal allocation, since they improve C/I either by combining gain or by reducing the co-channel interference in the same cell, respectively. MultiHop relays will increase system capacity (almost doubling system throughput with the overlapped allocation), especially improving a per-user data rate in the cell edges or heavily shadowed areas. As these relays eliminate the need for a wire line relay, they facilitate rapid deployment and warrant economic feasibility. However, in the MultiHop relay system of overlapped allocation, there must be some means of circumventing the additional outage events around the subcell edges of the relay stations incurred by fully reusing the frequency in every relay station. One particular approach is a cooperative relay scheme that allows transmitting duplicate signals via multiple relay stations and then, combining them constructively in the receiver [15].|$|R
