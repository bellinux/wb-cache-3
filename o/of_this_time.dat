5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} the sun is {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly the center of the sky to deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.|$|E

5|$|Alvarez {{proposed}} Muon tomography in 1965 {{to search}} the Egyptian pyramids for unknown chambers. Using naturally occurring cosmic rays, his scheme was to place spark chambers, standard equipment in the high-energy particle physics <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> beneath the second pyramid of Chephren in a known chamber. By measuring the counting rate of the cosmic rays in different directions the detector would reveal the existence of any void in the overlaying rock structure.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{spent most}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> {{exploring}} on land: {{three years and}} three months on land, 18 months at sea. Early in the voyage {{he decided that he}} could write a book about geology, and he showed a gift for theorising. At Punta Alta he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results that shook his belief that species were fixed and provided the basis for ideas which came to him when back in England, and led to his theory of evolution by natural selection.|$|E

5|$|In 1500, {{inspired}} by Palkuriki Somanatha (a bilingual poet in Kannada and Telugu), Singiraja synthesised an account {{on the life}} of Basavanna titled Maha Basavaraja Charitra (or Singiraja Purana), using the protagonist's vachana poems and giving details of his 88famous deeds, as well as information about his opponents in the court of Southern Kalachuri King BijjalaII. An eminent poet <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> was Guru Basava, known for his authorship of seven famous poems (Sapta Kavya), all but one being written in the shatpadi metre. He expounded on religious teachings in the form of formal discussions between the guru and disciple. His kavyas (classical epic poems) deal with spiritualism and extrasensory perception.|$|E
5|$|In November 1970, Power and Saxe {{became the}} sixteenth and seventeenth persons on the FBI's Most Wanted Fugitives list.

Saxe was able to elude arrest until 1975, when she was captured in Philadelphia. She then served five years in prison.|$|E
5|$|In this respect, Traherne's work {{is often}} {{compared}} to the abounding joy and mysticism found {{in the works of}} William Blake, Walt Whitman, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. According to Traherne scholar Denise Inge, Traherne's introduction of a child's viewpoint to narrate his theological and moral premises was unknown or certainly unappreciated in the literature <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> His poems frequently explore the glory of creation and what he perceived as his intimate relationship with God. He drew deeply on the writings of Aristotle and on the early Church Fathers for his concept of Man and human nature. Little mention is made of sin and suffering in the works that have dominated 20th-century criticism, and some critics have seen his verse as bordering upon pantheism (or perhaps panentheism).|$|E

5|$|Marshall {{returned}} to the East Coast in late September 1931. Although he was writing Arctic Village, he also wrote prolifically on other topics and published several articles about American forestry. In particular, he was concerned that few articles <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> {{addressed the issue of}} deforestation, and he {{wrote a letter to the}} president of the American Forestry Association, George D. Pratt, on the matter. He also pursued a variety of other activities: he accepted an invitation to serve on a committee to dedicate a memorial (Louis Marshall Memorial Hall) to his father at the forestry college in Syracuse. He lectured in various cities, delivering speeches about his travels and wilderness preservation.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 1777, the {{regiment}} and a detachment of the Maryland Line {{under the command}} of General William Smallwood (the 2nd Maryland Brigade) arrived at Wilmington, Delaware, to protect the city from the British.

This ship was laden with supplies, including winter clothing, en route to the British in Philadelphia.|$|E

They were originally appointed by the ship's captain and usually held such appointments while serving under the captain who selected them. The Petty Officers <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> did not have uniforms or a rank insignia. In 1841 a rate badge was assigned, consisting of a sleeve device displaying an eagle perched on an anchor. Rating marks did not appear until 1866.|$|E
5|$|Psittacosaurus {{is known}} from {{hundreds}} of individual specimens, of which over 75 have been assigned to the type species, P. mongoliensis. All Psittacosaurus fossils discovered {{so far have been}} found in Early Cretaceous sediments in Asia, from southern Siberia to northern China, and possibly as far south as Thailand. The most common age of geologic formations bearing Psittacosaurus fossils is from the late Barremian through Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous, or approximately 126 to 101mya (million years ago). Many terrestrial sedimentary formations of this age in Mongolia and northern China have produced fossils of Psittacosaurus, leading to the definition <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> period in the region as the Psittacosaurus biochron.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes faced {{competition}} for the Matabeleland mining concession from George Cawston and Lord Gifford, two London financiers. They appointed as their agent Edward Arthur Maund, who had served with Sir Charles Warren in Bechuanaland between 1884 and 1885, towards the end <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> visiting Lobengula as an official British envoy. Cawston and Gifford's base in England gave them the advantage of better connections with Whitehall, while Rhodes's location in the Cape allowed {{him to see the}} situation with his own eyes. He also possessed formidable financial capital and closer links with the relevant colonial administrators. In May 1888, Cawston and Gifford wrote to Lord Knutsford, the British Colonial Secretary, seeking his approval for their designs.|$|E

5|$|The {{determined}} {{resolution of}} the small party which held this small post {{for more than a}} month, against so comparatively large a force, must surely wring admiration from every voice, especially when the horrors of the latter portion <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> are considered; the dismal spectacle of their slaughtered comrades, the sufferings of their women and children thus immured with themselves, and the hopelessness of relief, which destroyed any other motive for their obstinate defence they made, than that resulting from a high sense of duty, supported by unsubdued courage. This, and a generous spirit of courtesy towards their enemy, certainly marked the character of the garrison of Kalunga, during the period of its siege.|$|E
5|$|The loss of {{a charismatic}} and {{dominant}} leader often precipitates the decline of such groups, but the Spirit Fruit Society persevered. This made the society unique among other groups <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> Though the commune continued after his death, their two publications, Spirit Voice and Spirit Fruit, ceased to be produced. Virginia Moore was chosen president of the society upon Beilhart's death, and the community stayed together and carried on its activities as before. In 1911, the society put an advertisement in the local papers seeking to sell their lakefront property and 'temple'. Virginia Moore stated that the Illinois climate was not suitable for their activities and the decision {{had been made to}} move to California. In the winter of 1914–1915, the society moved west.|$|E
5|$|Wiglaf (died 839) was King of Mercia from 827 to 829 {{and again}} from 830 until his death.
