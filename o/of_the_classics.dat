5|$|Through the Middle Ages Etymologiae was the {{textbook}} most in use, regarded so highly as {{a repository of}} classical learning that, in a great measure, it superseded {{the use of the}} individual works <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classics</b> themselves, full texts of which were no longer copied and thus were lost. It {{was one of the most}} popular compendia in medieval libraries.|$|E
5|$|A Canticle for Leibowitz {{is based}} on three short stories Miller contributed to The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. It is the only novel {{published}} by the author during his lifetime. (His follow-up work, Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman, was published posthumously in 1997.) Considered one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classics</b> of science fiction, {{it has never been}} out of print and has seen over 25 reprints and editions. Appealing to mainstream and genre critics and readers alike, it won the 1961 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel.|$|E
5|$|However, {{through the}} written {{dialogue}} in his diary, Choe did express slight {{differences between the}} cultures of China and Korea. For example, when the Chinese asked him {{whether or not the}} Korean education system offered degrees for specialists who dealt with only one of the Five Classics, Choe wrote that a Korean student who only studied one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Classics</b> and not all five of them was doomed to failing his exam and never attaining the rank of a full-fledged Confucian scholar.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{spatial pattern}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> (‘cored’) type <b>of</b> beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposit was studied in <b>the</b> upper laminae <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{superior}} temporal gyrus in 9 cases of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (SAD). Abeta stained tissue was counterstained with collagen IV {{to study the}} relationships between <b>the</b> spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> deposits and <b>the</b> blood vessel profiles. Both <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> deposits and blood vessel profiles were distributed in clusters. In all cases, there was a spatial correlation between <b>the</b> clusters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> deposits and <b>the</b> larger diameter (> 10 micron) blood vessel profiles and especially the vertically penetrating arterioles. In only 1 case, was there a significant spatial correlation between <b>the</b> clusters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> deposits and <b>the</b> smaller diameter (< 10 micron) capillaries. In 9 / 11 cases, <b>the</b> clusters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> deposits were significantly larger than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clusters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larger blood vessels. In addition, <b>the</b> density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> deposits declined as a negative exponential function with distance from the vertically penetrating arterioles. These results suggest that <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> Abeta deposits cluster around the larger {{blood vessels in the}} frontal cortex and that diffusion of proteins from these blood vessels could be involved in <b>the</b> pathogenesis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> deposits in SAD...|$|R
40|$|This essay explores <b>the</b> conceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classic,</b> and <b>of</b> {{literary}} value more generally, in T. S. Eliot's “What Is a Classic?” and Matthew Arnold's “Study of Poetry. ” Eliot's address heavily {{depends on}} Arnold's study, {{but there are}} significant points of difference, {{especially when it comes}} to <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> Homer and Virgil. Fundamentally, though, both Arnold and Eliot reach toward a transcendental, even religious, view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classic.</b> <b>The</b> essay concludes by developing <b>the</b> implications <b>of</b> Eliot's “last poet” and <b>the</b> silencing qualities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> hinted at in his address. These qualities have not been sufficiently understood, but taking them seriously shows why <b>the</b> current defense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> is dubious...|$|R

5|$|Stratton {{was exposed}} to {{multiple}} influences through his life. As an undergraduate student of Howison, he learned about philosophy and religion. At Yale and later at Wundt's lab, he switched to experimental psychology and studied perception, memory and emotion. His exposure to World War I, serving in the Army then, focused his mind on issues {{of war and peace}} and international relations. Stratton's later work reflected these elements of his experience. He was also a scholar <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classics</b> and translated some Greek philosophers.|$|E
5|$|The Paris–Roubaix {{is famous}} for rough terrain and cobblestones, or pavé (setts), being, with the Tour of Flanders, E3 Harelbeke and Gent–Wevelgem, one of the cobbled classics.

5|$|The {{team was}} built for strong showings in the classic cycle races, and {{includes}} the best classics rider from the 2010 season, world time trial champion Fabian Cancellara. Though Cancellara did not win any race that awarded points to the UCI World Tour, he consistently placed highly enough that he was briefly the world number one rider in the midst <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classics</b> season. Thanks to Cancellara's performances and the Schleck brothers both finishing on the podium at Liège–Bastogne–Liège, the team {{was also in the}} top spot for a time.|$|E

5|$|After the Tour, Simpson rode criteriums around Europe until {{crashing}} {{in central}} France; {{he returned home}} to Paris and checked himself into a hospital. Following a week's bed-rest, he rode in the road world championships at the Sachsenring in East Germany. During the race Simpson stopped to adjust his shoes {{on the right side}} of the road and was hit from behind by a car, sustaining a cut to his head which required five stitches. In the last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classics,</b> the Giro di Lombardia, he struggled, finishing eighty-fourth. Simpson had been in constant contact with Helen, who was now working in Stuttgart, Germany, meeting with her between races. They became engaged on Christmas Day, and originally planned to marry at the end of 1961, but in fact wed on 3 January 1961 in Doncaster, Yorkshire.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after {{publication}} of Preface to Plato, Havelock accepted {{a position as}} chair <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Classics</b> Department at Yale University.

He retired in 1973 and moved to Poughkeepsie, New York, where his wife Christine Mitchell, whom he had married in 1962, taught at Vassar College. He was a productive scholar after his retirement, writing three books as well as numerous essays and talks expanding the arguments of Preface to Plato to a generalised argument {{about the effect of}} literacy on Greek thought, literature, culture, society, and law.|$|E
5|$|Stratton {{served in}} the Army during World War I, {{developing}} psychological tests to select airmen for Army aviation. Exposure {{to the war effort}} prompted his interest in international relations and causes of wars. He was an anti-war believer who held psychology should aim to assist humanity's quest to avert future wars. He was optimistic that people and ethnicities, making up nations, could be taught to live in peace, though the races were not equal in inborn mental capacity, a belief he held as scientific. In the later part of his career he wrote books looking at international relations, war, and the differences between races on emotions. He was also a scholar <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classics</b> and translated Greek philosophers.|$|E
