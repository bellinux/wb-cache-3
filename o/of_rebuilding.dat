5|$|A {{project group}} {{with members of}} the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the National Rail Administration have {{proposed}} that instead <b>of</b> <b>rebuilding</b> the Ulriken Tunnel to double track, a new double-track light rail tunnel could be built from the city center to Arna. This would allow the light rail line to replace the two-station Bergen Commuter Rail service, and give better access to the city center for people from Arna. Several politicians, including the majority in Hordaland County Council, have stated {{that in the long run}} they want the light rail line extended northwards to Knarvik and westwards to Straume and Kleppestø.|$|E
5|$|A {{substantial}} amount <b>of</b> <b>rebuilding</b> followed. In 1733, work {{began on the}} royal residence of Christiansborg Palace which was completed in 1745. In 1749, development of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden was initiated. Designed by Nicolai Eigtved in the Rococo style, its centre contained the mansions which now form Amalienborg Palace. Major extensions to the naval base of Holmen were undertaken while the city's cultural importance was enhanced with the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts.|$|E

5|$|After the {{fighting}} in Normandy, Model established his headquarters at Oosterbeek, near Arnhem in the Netherlands, where he set about the massive task <b>of</b> <b>rebuilding</b> Army Group B. On 17 August 1944, Model {{was appointed to the}} temporary command of OB West, upon Kluge's recall to Berlin to answer charges that he had involvement with the failed July 20 plot (Kluge would commit suicide en route). Model retained command of OB West for eighteen days before Hitler appointed Gerd von Rundstedt as permanent replacement for Kluge, allowing Model to return to the command of Army Group B.|$|E
5|$|Ayer {{was devastated}} by {{a fire in}} 1872, but its {{industrial}} connections allowed for a period <b>of</b> <b>rebuilding</b> and even prosperity after. Most buildings in the Ayer Main Street Historic District were built during that time. When the Hoosac Tunnel opened in 1875, trains through Ayer could run on the Fitchburg and the Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad as far west as Troy, New York. With service to Troy, Boston, Nashua, Worcester, Lowell, and Greenville, Ayer Junction (soon shortened to Ayer) was a major rail interchange {{and the most important}} station on the Fitchburg Railroad between Concord and Fitchburg.|$|E
5|$|Brodie {{believed}} that previous historians had unduly vilified Stevens, and she enjoyed the prospect <b>of</b> <b>rebuilding</b> a reputation rather than, as in her Joseph Smith biography, tearing one down. Stevens {{as a champion}} of black people was a timely interest as the Civil Rights Movement increased in intensity. Research materials were available at Yale University, where Bernard Brodie was employed. Fawn Brodie wondered how Stevens had been affected psychologically by his physical deformity, a club foot.|$|E

5|$|Debates ensued {{over the}} fate of the Marysvale branch line. The mines {{at the end of the}} line had long closed; the last train to {{traverse}} the entire length of the line passed through in 1970. Still, farmers and industry in the Sevier and Sanpete Valleys generated enough traffic that the line broke even most years. However, this line was severely damaged, with several washed-out bridges and railroad tracks draping over the sides of newly created cliffs. The railroad determined that at best it would take years to recover the cost <b>of</b> <b>rebuilding</b> the line.|$|E
5|$|The 9th Division's {{role in the}} Second Battle of El Alamein {{ended on}} 5 November 1942. From 30 November the {{division}} travelled to Palestine by road, and all its units arrived there by 9 December. After settling into camps located between Gaza and Qastina, the 9th Division undertook a period <b>of</b> <b>rebuilding</b> and training, and many soldiers were granted leave. On 22 December, a formal parade involving the entire division was conducted at Gaza Airport.|$|E
5|$|The F-FDTL {{is still}} in the process <b>of</b> <b>rebuilding</b> from the events of 2006. It remains under-strength and is yet to reform its {{training}} and discipline standards. Tensions within the F-FDTL also continue to threaten the stability of the force. However, the East Timorese government places a high priority on re-establishing the F-FDTL and developing it into a force capable of defending the country. In 2015 the Australian Defence Intelligence Organisation reported that little {{progress has been made in}} implementing the Force 2020 plans.|$|E

5|$|Throughout his life, William Gibbs and {{his wife}} Matilda Blanche Crawley-Boevey (known as Blanche), principally lived in London, for {{the greater part of}} his {{marriage}} at 16 Hyde Park Gardens, which the family owned until Blanche's death. But as he travelled regularly on business to the Port of Bristol he required a residence in the area; thus it was, in 1843, he came to buy Tyntes Place, which he subsequently renamed Tyntesfield. Within a few years of making his purchase, Gibbs began a major program <b>of</b> <b>rebuilding</b> and enlarging of the mansion.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} {{the civil}} war, Henry's {{government}} faced the task <b>of</b> <b>rebuilding</b> royal authority across large parts of the country. By the end of 1217 many former rebels were routinely ignoring instructions from the centre, and even Henry's loyalist supporters jealously maintained their independent control over royal castles. Illegally constructed fortifications, called adulterine castles, had sprung up across much of the country. The network of county sheriffs had collapsed, and with it the ability to raise taxes and collect royal revenues. The powerful Welsh Prince Llywelyn posed a major threat in Wales and along the Welsh Marches.|$|E
5|$|A period <b>of</b> <b>rebuilding</b> and remodelling {{occurred}} in the late Middle Ages. A chantry chapel, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was founded in 1271 by the merchants Thomas Blount and John de Bucham, who endowed it with lands around Old and New Sleaford, and several surrounding villages. The chapel {{is located on the}} north aisle, and the chaplain was instructed to pray there for the founders at his daily mass. The chantry priest's house is recorded in the 1440s as one of the oldest buildings in Sleaford; located in the churchyard, it became the Vicarage. The tower was probably accompanied by a nave of a similar date, which was rebuilt in the Decorated Gothic style in the mid to late 14th century; the transept followed twenty or thirty years later, according to Trollope. A clerestory was added in around 1430 and the chancel was remodelled at this time.|$|E

5|$|After Carter left, Chris Bosh {{emerged as}} the team leader. In 2006–07, Bryan Colangelo's first full season as President and General Manager, a {{combination}} of Bosh, 2006 first overall NBA draft pick Andrea Bargnani and a revamp of the roster helped the Raptors qualify for their first playoff berth in five years, capturing the Atlantic Division title with 47 wins. In the 2007–08 season, they advanced to the playoffs again, but {{failed to make the}} playoffs in each of the next five seasons. In a bid to persuade Bosh to stay, Colangelo overhauled the team roster for the 2009–10 season, but Bosh signed with the Miami Heat in July 2010, ushering in yet another era <b>of</b> <b>rebuilding</b> for the Raptors.|$|E
5|$|As Cyclone Keli {{struck the}} islands of Tuvalu on June 12 and 13, peak wind gusts of 165km/h, (105mph) were reported, with {{extensive}} damage also reported throughout the Islands with trees uprooted by wind and waves. On Nivalakita all buildings except for the church were flattened with an estimated cost to rebuild the houses exactly as they were was estimated at A$12,000 (US$10,000 1997), while {{it was estimated that}} the cost <b>of</b> <b>rebuilding</b> the houses with an improved, cyclone-resistant design would be about A$84,000 (63,000 USD 1997). Also on Nivalakita communications were cut with the telephone operator having to resort to sending a Morse code message, however as the storm re-curved and re-hit Tuvalu on June 14, it silenced the weak radio telegraph system. In Tepuka Savilivili the whole island was left uninhabitable as coconut trees and other vegetation were swept away with no more than an area of jagged coral left behind.|$|E
5|$|Bergen Street was {{originally}} designed as an express station, {{but only the}} upper level is currently in service; the lower level is neither in regular service nor usable due to its deteriorated condition. The lower level of the station was used when express service was provided on the Culver Line between 1968 and 1976. Express service was eliminated due {{to the loss of}} direct local service along the line to Manhattan. The express platforms were permanently removed from service during the 1990s, and due to a fire in 1999 the relay room was damaged, making the express tracks unusable. The relay room was rebuilt in 2008, and after repairs were done on the line, the implementation of express service become feasible. In 2016, it was announced that the MTA was considering having express service brought back to the line. However, unlike the earlier express service, express trains will skip this station due to the high cost <b>of</b> <b>rebuilding</b> it, thus making the station a local stop.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Keli {{struck the}} islands of Tuvalu on June 12 and 13, with {{extensive}} damage reported throughout the Islands with trees uprooted by wind and waves. On Nivalakita, all buildings except for the church were flattened; an estimated cost to rebuild all of the houses as they were before the cyclone hit was estimated at A$ (US$), while {{it was estimated that}} the cost <b>of</b> <b>rebuilding</b> the houses with an improved, cyclone-resistant design would be about A$ (US$). The whole of Tepuka Savilivili was left uninhabitable, as coconut trees and other vegetation were swept away with no more than an area of jagged coral left behind. In Fiji, strong winds and rough seas were reported from the cyclone as it was moving to the north of Fiji, and while the cyclone was weakening it dropped 3.76inches (95.5mm) of rain on American Samoa.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his release}} from the {{hospital}} and as a prisoner of war—the exact date is unknown—Schnaufer took over the family wine business. He had never planned to run the family winery as his ambition had always been to pursue an officer's career in the Luftwaffe. However, {{in the immediate aftermath}} of World War II the business had virtually ceased to exist and Schnaufer was given the task <b>of</b> <b>rebuilding</b> it from scratch. He had to re-establish business links to suppliers and customers and to consolidate them. Then he had to make new contacts in order to facilitate expansion and growth of the business. Lastly, he had to create an infrastructure which supported the growth of the business.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the quake}} a program <b>of</b> <b>rebuilding</b> was rapidly put into action, but before {{it began in}} earnest some {{important}} decisions would permanently differentiate many Sicilian cities and towns from other European urban developments. The Viceroy, the Duke of Camastra, aware of new trends in town planning, decreed that rather than rebuilding in the medieval plan of cramped narrow streets, the new rebuilding would offer piazze and wider main streets, often on a rational grid system. The whole plan was often to take a geometric shape such as a perfect square or a hexagon, typical of Renaissance and Baroque town planning. The city of Grammichele represents an example of these new cities rebuilted with a hexagonal plan.|$|E
