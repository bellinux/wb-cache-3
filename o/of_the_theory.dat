40|$|First-order shear {{deformation}} theories, one proposed by Reissner {{and another one}} by Mindlin, are widely in use, even today, because of their simplicity. In this paper two new displacement based first-order {{shear deformation}} theories involving only two unknown functions, as against three functions in case of Reissners and Mindlin's theories, are introduced. For static problems, governing equations <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed <b>theories</b> are uncoupled. And for dynamic problems, governing equations <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theories</b> are only inertially coupled, whereas those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other <b>theory</b> are only elastically coupled. Both <b>the</b> <b>theories</b> are variationally consistent. <b>The</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theories</b> is brought out through illustrative examples. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theories</b> has striking similarity with classical plate theory...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{approach}} for designing decision procedures based on <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> complex <b>theories</b> to simpler ones. Specifically, we define reduction {{functions as a}} tool for reducing <b>the</b> satisfiability problem <b>of</b> a complex <b>theory</b> to <b>the</b> satisfiability problem <b>of</b> a simpler one. Reduction functions allow us to reduce <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> lists to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> constructors, <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> arrays to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> equality, <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> sets to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> equality, and <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> multisets to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> integers. Finally, we provide a method for combining reduction functions. This method allows us to reduce <b>the</b> satisfiability problem <b>of</b> a combination <b>of</b> complex <b>theories</b> to <b>the</b> combination <b>of</b> simpler ones. ...|$|R

5|$|A central {{organizing}} {{concept in}} biology is that life changes and develops through evolution, {{and that all}} life-forms known have a common origin. The theory of evolution postulates that all organisms on the Earth, both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral gene pool.
