5|$|The {{first step}} was a precise {{characterization}} of the error in the main mirror. Working backwards from images of point sources, astronomers determined that the conic constant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> as built was , instead of the intended −1.00230. The same number was also derived by analyzing the null corrector used by Perkin-Elmer to figure the mirror, {{as well as by}} analyzing interferograms obtained during ground testing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{studying}} {{the relationship between}} Calabi–Yau manifolds and certain conformal field theories called Gepner models, Brian Greene and Ronen Plesser found nontrivial examples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> relationship. Further evidence for this relationship came {{from the work of}} Philip Candelas, Monika Lynker, and Rolf Schimmrigk, who surveyed a large number of Calabi–Yau manifolds by computer and found that they came in mirror pairs.|$|E
5|$|Above the {{mounting}} platform was the stabilization gyro. This {{was connected to}} a wedge-shaped metal plate, causing the plate to rotate around a mounting point {{at the tip of}} the wedge. The rear part of the reflector sight was mounted at this point and the opposite end was supported by a rotating pintle inserted into a gudgeon mounted to the frame. Rolling the aircraft caused the gyro to rotate in the same direction, which was geared to cause the opposite motion in the reflector. As the sights worked by reflecting light off the reflector in the center, motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> would result in twice the motion of the aim point. To address this, the gyro was attached through levers with a 2-to-1 reduction.|$|E

5|$|Beryllium mirrors are of {{particular}} interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a honeycomb support structure, are used, for example, in meteorological satellites where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in optical guidance systems and in fire-control systems, e.g. in the German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks. In these systems, very rapid movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard electroless nickel plating which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.|$|E
5|$|From {{the figure}} of the artist, the viewer's eye leaps again diagonally into the {{pictorial}} space. Another man stands, echoing and opposing the form of the artist, outside rather than inside, made clearly defined and yet barely identifiable by the light and shade. The positioning of such an area of strong tonal contrast right {{at the rear of the}} pictorial space is a daring compositional tactic.

5|$|Regardless {{of whether}} Calabi–Yau compactifications of string theory provide a correct {{description}} of nature, the existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> duality between different string theories has significant mathematical consequences. The Calabi–Yau manifolds used in string theory {{are of interest}} in pure mathematics, and mirror symmetry allows mathematicians to solve problems in enumerative algebraic geometry, a branch of mathematics concerned with counting the numbers of solutions to geometric questions. A classical problem of enumerative geometry is to enumerate the rational curves on a Calabi–Yau manifold {{such as the one}} illustrated above. By applying mirror symmetry, mathematicians have translated this problem into an equivalent problem for the mirror Calabi–Yau, which turns out to be easier to solve.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} {{blamed the}} failings primarily on Perkin-Elmer. Relations between NASA and the optics {{company had been}} severely strained during the telescope construction, due to frequent schedule slippage and cost overruns. NASA found that Perkin-Elmer did not review or supervise the mirror construction adequately, did not assign its best optical scientists to the project (as it had for the prototype), and in particular did not involve the optical designers in the construction and verification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> While the commission heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for these managerial failings, NASA was also criticized for not picking up on the quality control shortcomings, such as relying totally on test results from a single instrument.|$|E

5|$|Autism is a {{disorder}} that {{is associated with}} social and communicative deficits. A single cause of autism has yet to be identified, but the mu wave and mirror neuron system have been studied specifically for their role in the disorder. In a typically developing individual, the mirror neuron system responds when he or she either watches someone perform a task or performs the task him- or herself. In individuals with autism, mirror neurons become active (and consequently mu waves are suppressed) only when the individual performs the task him- or herself. This finding has led some scientists, notably V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues, to view autism as disordered understanding of other individuals' intentions and goals due to problems with the mirror neuron system. This deficiency would explain the difficulty people with autism have in communicating with and understanding others. While most studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> neuron system and mu waves in people with autism have focused on simple motor tasks, some scientists speculate that these tests can be expanded to show that problems with the mirror neuron system underlie overarching cognitive and social deficits.|$|E
5|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> flaw on {{scientific}} observations {{depended on the}} particular observation—the core of the aberrated PSF was sharp enough to permit high-resolution observations of bright objects, and spectroscopy of point sources was only affected through a sensitivity loss. However, the loss of light to the large, out of focus halo severely reduced {{the usefulness of the}} telescope for faint objects or high-contrast imaging. This meant that nearly all of the cosmological programs were essentially impossible, since they required observation of exceptionally faint objects. NASA and the telescope became the butt of many jokes, and the project was popularly regarded as a white elephant. For instance, in the 1991 comedy , Hubble was pictured with the Lusitania, the Hindenburg, and the Edsel. Nonetheless, during {{the first three years of}} the Hubble mission, before the optical corrections, the telescope still carried out a large number of productive observations of less demanding targets. The error was well characterized and stable, enabling astronomers to partially compensate for the defective mirror by using sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution.|$|E

5|$|Velázquez's {{portrait}} is {{a staging}} {{of a private}} moment of intimacy and a dramatic departure from the classical depictions of sleep and intimacy found in works from antiquity and Venetian art that portray Venus. However, the simplicity with which Velázquez displays the female nude—without jewellery {{or any of the}} goddess's usual accessories—was echoed in later nude studies by Ingres, Manet, and Baudry, among others. In addition, Velázquez's depiction of Venus as a reclining nude viewed from the rear was a rarity before that time, although the pose has been painted by many later artists. Manet, in his stark female portrayal Olympia, paraphrased the Rokeby Venus in pose and by suggesting the persona of a real woman rather than an ethereal goddess. Olympia shocked the Parisian art world when it was first exhibited in 1863. Olympia gazes directly out at the viewer, as does Velázquez's Venus, only through the reflection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the season}} progresses, Elsa befriends series protagonist Emma Swan, Emma and the series' central cast resolving the help Elsa find Anna. The group {{eventually}} discovers that a figure named the Snow Queen (a more faithful {{adaptation of the}} original fairy tale's character) is somehow responsible for Elsa's trapping in her urn, a woman with similar powers to Elsa. They soon discover that the Snow Queen is Elsa's aunt, Ingrid, who was forgotten from Arendelle when Elsa's mother, Gerda, used {{the power of the}} troll king to erase everyones memory of her, not wishing for the world to remember how Ingrid accidentally killed their third sister, Helga. Ingrid soon discovered a prophecy that stated she would one day have the love of her sisters again. With Ingrid's sisters dead however, she believed she would be forced to create new sisters. For this, she chose Emma and Elsa. Ingrid had stalked Emma her entire life in preparation for the prophecy to become true, and manipulated events in Arendelle to bring Elsa to her. Being convinced that she could only gain their love when {{she was the only one}} left, she obtained a mirror capable of bringing out the worst in people (the mirror coming directly from The Snow Queen fairy tale). If a piece <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> were to get in someones eye, they would see nothing but hatred in the world. Ingrid had planned to use this on everyone in Storybrooke (dubbed the Spell of Shattered Sight), forcing all of its citizens to kill each other while she, Emma, and Elsa remained immune. Ingrid had also used this to her advantage on Anna, forcing Anna to trap Elsa in the urn they originally found Elsa in.|$|E

An optical fiber placed at <b>the</b> Cassegrain focus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> telescope then emits light towards <b>the</b> secondary <b>mirror</b> to create a collimated beam emitting from <b>the</b> primary <b>mirror.</b> Portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collimated beam are retro-reflected from flat <b>mirrors</b> at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber {{to pass through the}} telescope to the SI detector.
