5|$|Although {{only the}} United States Supreme Court can {{overturn}} {{the decisions of}} the Oregon Supreme Court, they cannot overturn decisions exclusively based on the Oregon law, though other mechanisms exist that effectively overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court can only accept cases from the Oregon Supreme Court if the decision involves issues <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> and interpretation <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> might change the outcome of the case. The Oregon Supreme Court is the final authority on Oregon law, and absent extraordinary circumstances the U.S. Supreme Court cannot overrule its interpretation of Oregon law (see adequate and independent state ground). Although only the U.S. Supreme Court can reverse or overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court, decisions of the court can be effectively overturned by changing the law. Thus later outcomes of the court can be affected by legislation passed by the Oregon Legislative Assembly or through the initiative and referendum process. Also, in most criminal decisions Oregon’s Governor or the President of the United States may issue a pardon (some crimes require the Oregon Legislature to concur).|$|E
5|$|Upper-level {{municipal}} {{divisions in}} the republic are formed {{within the boundaries of}} existing administrative divisions, although this is not a requirement <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>law.</b> Municipal districts are formed within the boundaries of the administrative districts, and municipal urban okrugs cover the territories of the cities/towns of the republican significance. Municipal urban settlements cover the territories of the urban-type settlements with adjacent rural localities, while municipal rural settlements cover the territories of groups of rural localities and largely correspond to the territories of former selsoviets.|$|E
5|$|As a United States {{district}} court, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri conducts civil {{trials and}} issues orders. The cases it hears concern either federal question jurisdiction, where {{a federal law}} or treaty is applicable, or diversity jurisdiction, where parties are domiciled in different states. The court also holds criminal trials of persons charged with violations <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>law.</b> Appeals from cases brought in the Eastern District of Missouri are heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit). These cases can then be appealed to the United States Supreme Court.|$|E

5|$|Illinois v.

In the initial filing, the state of Illinois sued Hemi Group LLC (Hemi) for selling cigarettes to Illinois residents over the Internet in violation of state law and for failing to report those sales in violation <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>law.</b> Hemi moved to dismiss the suit for lack of personal jurisdiction, but the district court found that the Internet transactions provided a basis for Hemi to be sued in Illinois.|$|E
5|$|The {{system of}} local self-governance, which Article12 of the Constitution of Russia guarantees, is {{implemented}} on the republic's territory {{in accordance with}} the provisions <b>of</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Law</b> No.131-FZ On the General Principles of the Organization of the Local Self-Government in the Russian Federation. While the law does not require any connection between the system of the administrative-territorial divisions of a federal subject and its municipal structure, Adygea's administrative districts are nevertheless incorporated as the municipal districts and the republican urban okrugs are incorporated as the municipal urban okrugs. On the lower level, the municipal districts are divided into municipal urban settlements, which combine an urban-type settlement and adjacent rural localities, and municipal rural settlements, which combine several neighboring rural localities.|$|E
5|$|One {{accident}} at the Mousetrap, a complex interchange, had national ramifications. On August 1, 1984, a truck carrying six torpedoes for the U.S. Navy overturned. The situation was made worse {{as no one}} answered at the phone number provided with the cargo, and an unknown liquid was leaking {{from one of the}} torpedoes. It took more than three hours before any military personnel arrived on the scene, U.S. Army personnel from a nearby base. The incident left thousands of cars stranded and Denver's transportation network paralyzed for about eight hours. Approximately 50 residents in the area were evacuated. Investigations later revealed that the truck driver did not follow a recommended route provided by state troopers, who specifically warned the driver to avoid the Mousetrap. The Navy promised reforms after being criticized for providing an unstaffed phone number with a hazardous cargo shipment, a violation <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>law,</b> and failing to notify Denver officials about the shipment. The Mousetrap was grandfathered into the Interstate Highway system, with some structures built in 1951. The incident provided momentum to rebuild the interchange with a more modern and safer design. Construction began in several phases in 1987 and the last bridge was dedicated in 2003.|$|E

40|$|Richard Posner’s {{version of}} {{judicial}} self-restraint implies that individual Justices who embrace restraint {{would tend to}} uphold the constitutionality of a law even if it went against their preferences or ideology. Judge Posner suggests that this form of restraint once existed but no longer does. Using a dataset of cases that considered the constitutionality <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>laws,</b> we explore whether, in line with Judge Posner’s hypothesis, the Court grew more activist (that is, more willing to strike laws) over the period between 1937 and 2009 and whether the ideological leanings of Justices, and not judicial self-restraint, better explain how they voted in cases challenging the constitutionality <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>laws.</b> Our results answer the question we pose in the Essay’s title in the affirmative: {{there was such a}} thing as judicial self-restraint, but there no longer is, just as Judge Posner suggests. Justices appointed since the 1960 s were and remain ideological in their approach to the constitutionality <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>laws...</b>|$|R

25|$|The Supreme Court of the United States is {{the highest}} federal court of the United States.

In the legal system of the United States, the Supreme Court is generally the final interpreter <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> including the United States Constitution, but it may act only {{within the context of}} a case, in which it has jurisdiction. The Court does not have power to decide political questions, and its enforcement arm is in the executive rather than judicial branch of government.|$|E
