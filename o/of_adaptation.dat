5|$|However, the {{aesthetic}} {{involved with the}} poetry goes much farther {{back in time and}} is used much more subtly than these examples suggest. Beyond issues <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> of text to film, Kiarostami often begins with an insistent will to give visual embodiment to certain specific image-making techniques in Persian poetry, both classical and contemporary, and often ends up enunciating a larger philosophical position, namely the ontological oneness of poetry and film.|$|E
5|$|Sima Daad {{from the}} Department of Comparative Literature at the University of Washington {{feels that the}} {{creative}} merit of Kiarostami's adaptation of Sohrab Sepehri and Forough Farrokhzad's poems extends the domain of textual transformation. Adaptation {{is defined as the}} transformation of a prior text to a new text. Kiarostami's adaptation arrives at theoretical realm <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> by expanding its limit from inter-textual potential to trans-generic potential.|$|E
5|$|Thirdly, the teleological {{explanation}} <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> {{is uncomfortable}} {{because it seems}} to require backward causation, in which existing traits are explained by future outcomes; {{because it seems to}} attribute the action of a conscious mind when none is assumed to be present in an organism; and because, as a result, adaptation looks impossible to test empirically.|$|E

5|$|Though coral {{have large}} sexually-reproducing populations, their {{evolution}} can be slowed by abundant asexual reproduction. Gene flow is variable among coral species. According to the biogeography of coral species gene flow cannot {{be counted on}} as a dependable source <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> as they are very stationary organisms. Also, coral longevity might factor into their adaptivity.|$|E
5|$|Bats {{are natural}} {{reservoirs}} {{for a large}} number of zoonotic pathogens, including rabies, histoplasmosis both directly and in guano, Nipah Hendra viruses, and possibly ebola virus. Their high mobility, broad distribution, long life spans, substantial sympatry, and social behaviour make bats favourable hosts and vectors of disease. Compared to rodents, bats carry more zoonotic viruses per species, and each virus is shared with more species. They seem to be highly resistant to many of the pathogens they carry, suggesting a degree <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> to bats' immune systems. Furthermore, their interactions with livestock and pets, including predation by vampire bats, accidental encounters, and the scavenging of bat carcasses, compound the risk of zoonotic transmission.|$|E
5|$|Climatic and osmotic {{pressure}} places physiological constraints on organisms, {{especially those that}} fly and respire at high altitudes, or dive to deep ocean depths. These constraints influence vertical limits of ecosystems in the biosphere, as organisms are physiologically sensitive and adapted to atmospheric and osmotic water pressure differences. For example, oxygen levels decrease with decreasing pressure and are a limiting factor for life at higher altitudes. Water transportation by plants is another important ecophysiological process affected by {{osmotic pressure}} gradients. Water pressure {{in the depths of}} oceans requires that organisms adapt to these conditions. For example, diving animals such as whales, dolphins, and seals are specially adapted to deal with changes in sound due to water pressure differences. Differences between hagfish species provide another example <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> to deep-sea pressure through specialized protein adaptations.|$|E

5|$|By his return, he was {{critical}} of the Bible as history, and wondered why all religions should not be equally valid. In the next few years, while intensively speculating on geology and the transmutation of species, he gave much thought to religion and openly discussed this with his wife Emma, whose beliefs also came from intensive study and questioning. The theodicy of Paley and Thomas Malthus vindicated evils such as starvation {{as a result of}} a benevolent creator's laws, which had an overall good effect. To Darwin, natural selection produced the good <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> but removed the need for design, and he could not see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering, such as the ichneumon wasp paralysing caterpillars as live food for its eggs. He still viewed organisms as perfectly adapted, and On the Origin of Species reflects theological views. Though he thought of religion as a tribal survival strategy, Darwin was reluctant to give up the idea of God as an ultimate lawgiver. He was increasingly troubled by the problem of evil.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed, in his Philosophie Zoologique of 1809, {{a theory}} of the {{transmutation}} of species (transformisme). Lamarck {{did not believe that}} all living things shared a common ancestor but rather that simple forms of life were created continuously by spontaneous generation. He also believed that an innate life force drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear ladder of complexity that was related to the great chain of being. Lamarck recognized that species adapted to their environment. He explained this by saying that the same innate force driving increasing complexity caused the organs of an animal (or a plant) to change based on the use or disuse of those organs, just as exercise affects muscles. He argued that these changes would be inherited by the next generation and produce slow adaptation to the environment. It was this secondary mechanism <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that would become known as Lamarckism and would influence discussions of evolution into the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|A {{literature}} assessment by Adger et al. (2007:719) {{concluded that}} {{there was a lack of}} comprehensive, global cost and benefit estimates for adaptation.

A number <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> measures were identified as having high benefit-cost ratios.|$|E
