5000|$|On 12 July 2013, {{the last}} four cars of an SNCF Paris-Limoges train left the track while {{entering}} the Brétigny-sur-Orge station, killing seven people and injuring 32. The French land transport accident investigation bureau BEA-TT concluded in an interim report published on 10 January 2014 that [...] "the derailment {{was caused by a}} fishplate obstructing the flangeway of an <b>oblique</b> <b>crossing</b> forming part of a double slip. Under the weight of the train travelling at 137 km/h, the fishplate had pivoted around the first of four bolts meant to hold it in place, the three others having come loose. The most likely cause of the bolts coming loose, says BEA-TT, were stresses caused by cracking in the cast steel crossing. This had caused the head of the third bolt to break off and the others to fail, one becoming unscrewed and the heads of the other two also shearing off." [...] Recommendations included improving agency expertise in bolted track joints, clarification and reinforcement of regulations for defect detection and repair, and identification of switches and crossings where higher levels of maintenance and early renewal should be implemented.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} fibrous assemblies, particularly the transverse behavior of fiber yarns and multifilament strands depends, inter alia, on the fiber-to-fiber contact and sliding. All studies on inter fiber friction {{presented in the}} literature focus on cases where the relative inter fiber motion occurs either in longitudinal-to-longitudinal or longitudinal-to-transverse direction. The transverse-to-transverse inter fiber friction {{plays an important role}} as far as the mechanical transverse behavior of fiber yarns and multifilament strands are concerned. In order to evaluate the case named here ‘transverse friction, the present study proposes an original method and an associated model analyzing the transversal component of friction between two <b>oblique</b> <b>crossing</b> fibers. A relatively simple and original statistical approach has also been developed to evaluate the confidence interval of friction coefficient. The first results show a relative stability of the transverse friction. This coefficient is also significantly inferior to the longitudinal one...|$|E
40|$|Diagnosing plasma {{conditions}} can give great advantages in optimizing plasma wakefield accelerator experiments. One possible method {{is that of}} photon acceleration. By propagating a laser probe pulse through a plasma wakefield and extracting the imposed frequency modulation, one can obtain {{an image of the}} density modulation of the wakefield. In order to diagnose the wakefield parameters at a chosen point in the plasma, the probe pulse crosses the plasma at oblique angles relative to the wakefield. In this paper, mathematical expressions relating the frequency modulation of the laser pulse and the wakefield density profile of the plasma for <b>oblique</b> <b>crossing</b> angles are derived. Multidimensional particle-in-cell simulation results presented in this paper confirm that the frequency modulation profiles and the density modulation profiles agree to within 10 %. Limitations to the accuracy of the measurement are discussed in this paper. This technique opens new possibilities to quantitatively diagnose the plasma wakefield density at known positions within the plasma column...|$|E

40|$|Attention has {{recently}} {{been focused on the}} appearance of myofilaments in freeze-fractured and freeze-etched replicas (1, 2). From these studies it is apparent that cross fracturing of unfixed myofibrils always reveals thick (myosin) filaments as projections in both etched and unetched preparations. Furthermore, in an <b>oblique</b> <b>cross</b> fracture, there is a very striking change in appearance on crossing the M line: the broken-off ends of the myosin filaments extend above the fracture face to a much greater extent on one side (the M+ zone) than on the other (the M- zone) (1, 2, 3). It has been suggested that this difference, termed the M+/M- phenomenon (1), is dependent on the molecular polarity of the thick filaments (2). Usin...|$|R

The top layer etched a three-order <b>oblique</b> fractal-shaped <b>cross</b> dipole slot set in a square patch and the bottom one is a solid metal.

40|$|Does {{the visual}} system {{represent}} stereoscopic depth purely as {{a map of}} local disparities, or does it explicitly represent local relationships of disparity, such as disparity gradients? Experiments are reported in which visual search for a target containing the same disparity range as other elements in the display, but differing in {{the relationship of the}} disparities (stereo slant), was used to determine whether the target showed 'pop-out' like a unitary feature, or the serial search characteristic of feature conjunctions. Each stereo pair of elements was selected randomly from a range of outline parallelograms leaning to the right or to the left, so that the target could not be identified using any monocular shape cue. Response times for detection of the target (present on 50 % of the trials) were independent of the number of elements in the display. This result was confirmed by varying element size and spacing, and by using <b>oblique</b> <b>crosses</b> rather than parallelograms as stimuli. It is concluded that stereoscopically defined slant, or disparity gradient, can be processed and compared in parallel across the display, and acts in this respect as an explicit unitary visual property. This contrasts with findings in analogous experiments on movement, which show that targets defined by divergence or deformation of optic flow can only be identified by serial search...|$|R

40|$|Effective {{three-dimensional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI) requires an accurate method for taking planar cross sections. However, if an <b>oblique</b> <b>cross</b> section is taken, the plane may not intersect any known data points. Thus, a method is needed to interpolate water density between data points. Interpolation assumes continuity of density, but there are discontinuities {{in the human body}} at the borders of different types of tissue. Most interpolation methods try to smooth these sharp borders, blurring the data and possibly destroying useful information. To capture qualitatively the key difÞculties of this problem, we created a sequence of simulated biological data sets, such as a brain and an arm, each with some speciÞc defect. Our data sets are cubic arrays with 100 elements on each side, for a total of one million elements, specifying water density at each point with an integer in the range [0, 255]. In each data set, we use differentiable functions to describe several tissue types with discontinuities between them. To analyze these data, we created a group of algorithms, implemented in C++, and compared their effectiveness in generating accurate cross sections. We used local interpolation techniques, because the data are not continuous on a global level. Our Þnal algorithm searches for discontinuities between tissues. If it Þnds one at a point, it preserves sharp edges by assigning to that point the water density of the nearest data point. If there is no discontinuity, the algorithm does a polynomial Þt in three dimensions to the nearest 64 data points and interpolates the water density...|$|R
