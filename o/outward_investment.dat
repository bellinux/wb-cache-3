This provides the hypothetical benchmark of what would have happened to domestic activities if firms had not invested abroad. We find no evidence of a negative effect of <b>outward</b> <b>investments</b> to cheap labour countries. In Italy they enhance the efficiency of home activities, with also positive long term effect on output and employment growth.

40|$|Does <b>outward</b> <b>investment</b> induce more {{domestic}} innovation {{or simply}} move local inno-vative efforts to foreign plants?

The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of <b>outward</b> <b>investment</b> in China on domestic innovative activity in Taiwan. Overall, this study finds that a positive relationship exists between <b>outward</b> <b>investment</b> and innovation in terms of R&D intensity and patents, implying that investing in China is part of a global resource allocation strategy of Taiwanese multinational enterprises to allocate production in China and pay more attention to innovative activity in their domestic plants. Moreover, the deregulation of the policy regarding investing in China in 2001 has induced an upsurge in investment in China, although it does not seem to have brought about an outflow of technologies. jere_ 498 538 [...] 557 JEL Classification Numbers: F 21, F 23, O 32. 1...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{assesses the}} impact of China's outward foreign direct {{investment}} on local workers and firms in- Cambodia and Vietnam and considers whether Chinese firms establish regional production networks through their <b>outward</b> <b>investment.</b> Previous studies have concluded that foreign direct investment from emerging economies may contribute more to host country development mainly due to a lower technology gap and greater psychic and institutional proximity. Empirical evidence that confirms this theory is scarce, however. Similarly, the extent to which emerging economies' <b>outward</b> <b>investment</b> induces new regional production networks is little understood. This thesis addresses these two research gaps on the basis of interviews with 60 Chinese investors in the manufacturing industries of Cambodia and Vietnam, complemented by interviews with domestically owned firms, stakeholders and experts, and secondary data. The analyses indicate that Chinese manufacturing investment has had few positive effects. On the other hand, no negative effects have been observed, either. Chinese firms {{have a positive impact on}} the domestic workforce, but little interaction with local firms, which reduces the potential gains from spillovers. Backward and forward linkages are stronger in Vietnam than in Cambodia, but local sourcing is in both host countries confined to simple types of input goods. As a consequence, benefits for local firms from training or other support are very limited. Chinese firms in Cambodia and Vietnam have also not yet been found to set up their own regional production networks. The limited benefits to host countries contrast with theoretical expectations, but are in line with findings on industrialised-country <b>outward</b> <b>investment.</b> This suggests that the effects of <b>outward</b> <b>investment</b> by emerging economies may not be so. different from those of <b>outward</b> <b>investment</b> from industrialised countries.
