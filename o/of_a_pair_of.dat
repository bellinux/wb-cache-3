5|$|A road {{bearing the}} M-81 {{designation}} has existed {{since at least}} July 1, 1919, when the state initially numbered its trunkline highways. Since that time, it has been extended, rerouted or shortened several times. These changes resulted in essentially the modern highway routing by 1926; the highway was fully paved in the 1940s. A change made in 1929 was reversed in 1933, and an extension through downtown Saginaw in the 1960s was overturned in the 1970s. The last change was the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> roundabouts at the I-75/US23 interchange in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Chelicerate nervous {{systems are}} based on the {{standard}} arthropod model <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> nerve cords, each with a ganglion per segment, and a brain formed by fusion of the ganglia just behind the mouth with those ahead of it. If one assume that chelicerates lose the first segment, which bears antennae in other arthropods, chelicerate brains include only one pair of pre-oral ganglia instead of two. However, there is evidence that the first segment is indeed available and bears the cheliceres.|$|E
5|$|Diamond's thermal {{conductivity}} is {{made use of}} by jewelers and gemologists who may employ an electronic thermal probe to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> battery-powered thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures {{the temperature of the}} copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds.|$|E

5|$|Harold Melvin Agnew {{was born}} in Denver, Colorado on March 28, 1921, the only child <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> stonecutters. He {{attended}} South Denver High School and entered the University of Denver, where he majored in chemistry. He was a strong athlete who pitched for the university softball that won a championship. He left the University of Denver in January 1942, but had enough credits to graduate Phi Beta Kappa with his Bachelor of Arts degree in June, and he received a scholarship to Yale University.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, the {{presence}} of commercial enterprises in the Forbidden City has become controversial.

5|$|The Conservators {{applied for}} a second act of {{parliament}} in 1707, as they needed a further £3,800 to finance projects including {{the building of a}} half-lock and the removal of a shoal just below Knapp Bridge. Boats carrying 15tons of cargo could reach Taunton by 1717. The navigation included a lock and two or more half-locks, consisting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> gates to hold back the water, and an agreement to build a towpath between Ham Mills and Taunton was reached in 1724.|$|E
5|$|The Erzherzog Ferdinand Max class {{consisted}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> ironclad warships {{and built}} for the Austrian Navy in the 1860s. They were the last broadside armored frigates to be {{built for the}} Austrian Empire, and the last vessels completed to see action against the Italians at the Battle of Lissa in 1866. Intended to have been armed with new breech-loading Krupp guns, {{the outbreak of the}} Seven Weeks' War prevented the delivery of the guns, forcing the Austrian Navy to arm the ships with a battery of sixteen older 48-pounder muzzle-loading guns.|$|E
5|$|The Tower domain {{adopts a}} {{secondary}} structure consisting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> long, antiparallel alpha-helices (the stem) that support a three-helix bundle (3HB) at their end. The 3HB contains a helix-turn-helix motif and {{is similar to}} the DNA binding domains of the bacterial site-specific recombinases, and of eukaryotic Myb and homeodomain transcription factors. The Tower domain has {{an important role in the}} tumour suppressor function of BRCA2, and is essential for appropriate binding of BRCA2 to DNA.|$|E

5|$|The first, indirect, {{detection}} of gravitational waves {{came in the}} 1970s through observation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> closely orbiting neutron stars, PSR B1913+16.

Einstein's prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016, when researchers at LIGO published the first observation of gravitational waves, on Earth, exactly one hundred years after the prediction.|$|E
5|$|The {{game would}} be the first of the 1985–86 season for both teams. Since the return fixture at Hampden Park on 27 March, both teams had played twice, with each playing one of the other teams in the {{qualifying}} group and a friendly. Wales had secured a comfortable home win against Spain in the World Cup qualifying tournament, but had gone down to defeat in Norway. Scotland meanwhile went into the match on the back <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> wins against England and Iceland.|$|E

5|$|The {{ignition}} system {{consisted of two}} rear-mounted, crankshaft-driven magnetos, each supplying one <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> spark plugs fitted to each cylinder.

5|$|The {{method of}} Mokhtarian and Mackworth {{involves}} computing the curve-shortening flow, tracking the inflection {{points of the}} curve as they progress through the flow, and drawing a graph that plots {{the positions of the}} inflection points around the curve against the time parameter. The inflection points will typically be removed from the curve in pairs as the curve becomes convex (according to the Gage–Hamilton–Grayson theorem) and the lifetime <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> points corresponds to the salience of a feature of the shape.|$|E
5|$|This {{can be used}} {{to derive}} the {{correlation}} of the quantum polarisations of the two photons. Their prediction was confirmed experimentally by Chien-Shiung Wu and I. Shaknov in 1950. This was the first experimental confirmation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> entangled photons as applicable to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox. The result was subsequently explained by Richard Dalitz and Frank Duarte. Apparently following Dirac's doctrine, Ward was never bothered by issues of interpretation in quantum mechanics.|$|E

5|$|Adamussium colbecki is a large, slow-growing scallop {{that lives}} on the seabed. The shell {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> ribbed calcareous valves which enclose the soft body and are joined by a ligament at a hinge. It feeds on microscopic green algae and is sometimes present in great numbers. It is able to move around by flapping its valves and to dart backwards to escape threats. The species is an important member of the Antarctic seabed community as the upper valve often acts as a substrate for seaweeds, sponges and other organisms. In addition, juveniles bind themselves by threads to the upper valve of older shells, using these {{as a base for}} several years as they grow. The adult scallops have been used in research to study the accumulation of heavy metals in marine organisms.|$|E
5|$|Another fleet {{operation}} {{took place}} on 18–19 October, though it ended without encountering any British units. Unit training in the Baltic was then conducted, and on the return voyage the III Squadron was diverted {{to assist in the}} recovery <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> U-boats stranded on the Danish coast. The fleet was reorganized on 1 December; the four König-class battleships remained in the III Squadron, along with the newly commissioned , while the five Kaiser-class ships, including König Albert, were transferred to IV Squadron. König Albert saw no major operations {{in the first half of}} 1917, and on 18 August she went into drydock at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel for periodic maintenance, which lasted until 23 September.|$|E
5|$|Chopsticks: The Han dynasty {{historian}} and writer Sima Qian (145–86 BC) {{wrote in the}} Records of the Grand Historian that King Zhou of Shang {{was the first to}} make chopsticks out of ivory in the 11th century BC; the most ancient archaeological find <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> chopsticks, made of bronze, comes from Shang Tomb 1005 at Houjiazhuang, Anyang, dated roughly 1200 BC. By 600 BC, the use of chopsticks had spread to Yunnan (Dapona in Dali), and Töv Province by the 1st century. The earliest known textual reference to the use of chopsticks comes from the Han Feizi, a philosophical text written by writer and philosopher Han Fei (c. 280–233 BC) in the 3rd century BC.|$|E
