5|$|Hellblazer {{was set in}} a {{contemporary}} world, albeit a world of magic and supernatural conflict behind the scenes. The series is largely isolated {{from the rest of}} the DC Universe, in which the supernatural or paranormal did not play a large role in the lives of most <b>ordinary</b> <b>people,</b> and in Earth-threatening circumstances no superhero interventions were shown or hinted at, suggesting that superheroes no longer existed there.

5|$|Thus, Henry's veneration as a saint and his {{relation}} to King Eric {{seem to have}} emerged in the historical record {{at the same time}} in the mid-1290s with strong support from the church. This correlates with the start of the war against Novgorod. Sources do not support the popular assumption, that Henry's cult had developed in Nousiainen and gradually spread among <b>ordinary</b> <b>people</b> before official adoption. Although Nousiainen had Henry as its patronus, that is first mentioned only in 1452. Still in 1232, the church in Nousiainen was consecrated to the Virgin Mary only.|$|E
5|$|According to Packer, {{another common}} theme in Gordimer's novels is the choices <b>ordinary</b> <b>people</b> {{who live in}} oppressive regimes are forced to make. Literary critics Turgeon and Carli Coetzee explain that when she realises that whites are not always welcome in the anti-apartheid liberation movements, Rosa repudiates her father's {{struggle}} and leaves the country. Marsh-Lockett says that part of Rosa's struggle is forging her own identity, and this decision to rebel against her dead father is a bold step, although she does return later to South Africa to become a committed activist and ultimately a political prisoner. But, according to Coetzee, what Rosa achieves is what her father never could: {{to have a life}} of her own while still remaining politically committed.|$|E
5|$|Bellman's poetry {{continued}} to be read and sung throughout the nineteenth century, contrary to the widespread belief among researchers that he was largely forgotten during this period. His songs were sung especially by the urban bourgeoisie and in fraternities, but also in aristocratic circles and <b>ordinary</b> <b>people</b> in the countryside. The , named after a phrase in Epistle 14, was founded in Uppsala in 1853; the song became their trademark. The Epistles and Songs were published in chapbooks, sung at festivals and performed {{in a variety of}} concerts and entertainments. Figures such as Fredman, Ulla Winblad and Movitz, as well as Bellman himself were painted on tavern walls and memorabilia such as plates, beer tankards and hipflasks. Curiously, Bellman was celebrated at least as enthusiastically in polite and abstemious circles, though with bowdlerized versions of the songs.|$|E
40|$|In {{analyzing}} any society, {{particularly those}} which, like Serbia, have undergone deep ruptures and turmoil {{in a short}} period of time, the perspective of everyday life and <b>ordinary</b> <b>people's</b> experiences is indispensable. In addition, the application of current sociological and anthropological theories of everyday life on today's Serbia, seeking to capture personalized interpretations whereby ordinary citizens make sense of all that has happened to them during the past fifteen years, can yield broader theoretical implications. For, from this perspective it is easier to identify the limited and partial nature of various theories articulated in other, stable societies. In this overview some of these theories are marked along with starting premises of the research, and key events and symbolically charged concepts of the most recent Serbian history that will be the focus of the analysis of <b>ordinary</b> <b>people's</b> narratives collected through targeted fieldwork...|$|R
