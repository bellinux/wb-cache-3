5|$|She had {{formerly}} had {{the same}} symptoms of arsenical poison herself, and it was some time before she discovered {{it to be the}} mesmeric work of an enemy. Soon after her marriage her husband began to manifest the same symptoms and had since shown them from time to time; but was, with her help, always able to overcome them. A few weeks ago she observed that he did not look well, and when questioned {{he said that he was}} unable to get the idea of this arsenical poison <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> He had been steadily growing worse ever since, but still had hoped to overcome the trouble until the last. After the death the body had turned black.|$|E
5|$|After {{agreeing on}} an initial idea, Bushnell and Dabney {{began trying to}} design a {{prototype}} based on a Data General Nova. Initially {{they were joined by}} Larry Bryan, a computer programmer who also worked at Ampex. Bushnell and Dabney put US$100 each into a partnership, named Syzygy by Bryan. They soon ran into difficulties with their planned design; the computer was not powerful enough to refresh the monitors as fast as was needed to make the game playable. Bryan realized this early on, when trying to design the code needed to run the games, and left the project before Syzygy was formed without ever contributing any money, but Bushnell and Dabney continued working on the design for several more months. The pair attempted to reduce the load on the computer by replacing subroutines—such as displaying the background stars—with specialized hardware, but it proved insufficient; even reducing the number of monitors was not enough. By the end of November 1970, Bushnell decided to abandon the project as untenable, while Dabney had stopped working on the design a while before. It is unclear if the pair were aware that Data General had demonstrated a more powerful variant of the Nova, sold for US$8,000, running a single game of Spacewar at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in December 1968, though that solution would have been too expensive for an arcade game, which typically cost US$1,000 at the time. Unable to put the game idea <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> however, Bushnell soon thought of a way to manipulate the video signal on the screen without a computer controlling it, and from there Syzygy {{came up with the idea}} of removing the computer altogether and building specialized hardware to handle everything for the game instead.|$|E
25|$|Hamlet {{has been}} {{compared}} to the Earl of Essex, who was executed for leading a rebellion against Queen Elizabeth. Essex's situation has been analyzed by scholars for its revelations into Elizabethan ideas of madness in connection with treason as they connect with Hamlet. Essex was largely seen as <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> by Elizabethans, and admitted to insanity on the scaffold before his death. Seen in the same context, Hamlet is quite possibly as mad as he is pretending to be, at least in an Elizabethan sense.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} rekindle Catherine's affection, Grigory {{presented}} to {{her one of}} the greater diamonds of the world, known ever since as the Orlov Diamond. When Grigory Potemkin, in 1771, superseded Vasil'chikov, Orlov became of no account at court and went abroad for some years. He returned to Russia a few months previously to his death, which took place at Moscow in 1783. For some time before his death he was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> Late in life he married his niece, Madame Zinovyeva, but left no children by that marriage.|$|E
25|$|The ensuing Mother's Milk Tour put {{even further}} strain on Flea's marriage. In {{order to make}} money, he needed to tour, and {{therefore}} spent time away from his family. Furthermore, he and Smith were arrested on charges of battery and sexual harassment after a performance on MTV's coverage of spring break; charges were eventually dropped. The band was, however, attracting over three thousand people per show; Mother's Milk had been certified as a gold record in early 1990. By the time Red Hot Chili Peppers returned to Los Angeles, Flea and Loesha agreed to a separation. He {{tried to put the}} separation <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> by smoking marijuana and having sex with random groupies, when the band was on tour for Mother's Milk.|$|E
25|$|Monty {{has brought}} {{supplies}} and persistently comes on to Marwood. He offers {{to take them}} into town to get fitted into rubber boots, but they end up spending the money he gave them on drinks. Monty is hurt, though he puts it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> quickly during a boozy round of poker. Marwood is terrified of what else Monty might try on him and wants to leave immediately. After much argument, Withnail insists on staying. Late in the night, Marwood keeps trying to evade Monty but he eventually corners him in the guest bedroom. Monty reveals that Withnail, when arranging to borrow the cottage, had told Monty that Marwood was a closeted homosexual and that he himself had rejected Marwood's advances. Marwood claims that Withnail is the closeted one and {{that the two of}} them have been in a committed relationship for years. He claims that Withnail is only rejecting him because Monty is around, and that this is the first night that they haven't slept together in years. Monty, a romantic, accepts this explanation and apologises for coming between them. In private, Marwood furiously confronts Withnail and insists that he will pay.|$|E
6000|$|No one {{was much}} dismayed at what all {{regarded}} as a trifling ailment, even if dignified as German. Angela owned that she regarded it as a relief, since infection might last till the summer, and {{the only person who}} was--as he owned--trying to laugh at himself with Angela, was Bernard, who could not keep <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind's</b> eye a little grave at Colombo. As he walked home, at the turning he saw a figure wearily toiling upwards, which proved to be Wilfred. [...] "Holloa! you are at home early!" ...|$|R

They met but rarely, and then interchanged the most simple and modest of salutations: but Tom liked to meet her, would have gladly stopped to chat with her; however, whether from modesty or from a guilty conscience, she always hurried on in silence.|$|R

500|$|The film {{opens with}} a series of still {{photographs}} appearing over melancholic music, representing the abstract memories of the unseen Herman Raucher, now a middle-aged man. Raucher recalls the summer he spent on the island in 1942. The film flashes back to a day that then 15-year-old [...] "Hermie" [...] and his friends – jock Oscy and introverted nerd Benjie – spent playing on the beach. They spot a young soldier carrying his new bride into a house on the beach, and are struck by her beauty, especially Hermie, who is unable to get her <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
500|$|In August 1799, Archduke Charles {{received}} {{orders from}} his brother, the Emperor, {{to withdraw the}} Austrian army across the Rhine. [...] While Charles could see this to be unreasonable—Alexander Suvorov had not yet reached central Switzerland, and it was folly to think that Alexander Korsakov's force of 30,000 and Hotze's 20,000 could hold all of the region until {{the arrival of the}} rest of the Russian force—the order was emphatic. Charles delayed as long as he could, but in late August he withdrew his force across the Rhine and headed toward Phillipsburg. When Suvorov heard of this breach of military common-sense, he wondered [...] "the owl [...] has either gone <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> or he never had one." [...] The order was eventually reversed too late for the Archduke to stop his withdrawal.|$|E
500|$|The Beer 'N' Brawl redneck bar {{is based}} on the bar in the film Urban Cowboy. The Beer 'N' Brawl sells Laramie High Tar cigarettes, a {{reference}} to the American cigarette brand Laramie. After arriving home from the Beer 'N' Brawl, Lurleen's song is stuck in Homer's head, and he even sings it to his bowling ball for good luck. Homer's co-worker Lenny decides to give it a shot and sings [...] "There's a Kind of Hush (All Over the World)" [...] to his bowling ball. Homer says that the last song before Lurleen's [...] "Your Wife Don't Understand You" [...] that he could not get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> was the Lipps Inc song [...] "Funkytown". The syndicated country comedy show that Lurleen appears on, Ya-Hoo!, {{is based on}} the country television series Hee Haw, which ran in syndication from 1971 to 1993.|$|E

500|$|In June 2009, NME {{published}} an article detailing Love's plan to reunite Hole and release a new album, Nobody's Daughter. In response, former Hole guitarist Eric Erlandson stated in Spin magazine that contractually no reunion could take place without his involvement; therefore Nobody's Daughter would remain Love's solo record, {{as opposed to a}} [...] "Hole" [...] record. Love responded to Erlandson's comments in a Twitter post, claiming [...] "he's <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> Hole is my band, my name, and my Trademark". Nobody's Daughter was released worldwide as a Hole album on April 27, 2010. For the new line-up, Love recruited guitarist Micko Larkin, Shawn Dailey (bass guitar), and Stu Fisher (drums, percussion). Nobody's Daughter featured material written and recorded for Love's unfinished solo album, How Dirty Girls Get Clean, including [...] "Pacific Coast Highway", [...] "Letter to God", [...] "Samantha", and [...] "Never Go Hungry", although they were re-produced in the studio with Larkin and engineer Michael Beinhorn. The album's subject matter was largely centered on Love's tumultuous life between 2003 and 2007, and featured a polished folk rock sound, and more acoustic guitar work than previous Hole albums.|$|E
500|$|Frusciante {{developed}} serious drug habits while touring {{with the}} band during the previous four years. He {{said that when he}} [...] "found out that Flea was stoned <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> at every show, that inspired me to be a pothead". Not only was Frusciante smoking large amounts of marijuana, but he began to use heroin and {{was on the verge of}} full-scale addiction. Upon returning to California in the summer of 1992, Frusciante entered a deep depression, feeling that his life was over and that he could no longer write music or play guitar. For a long time, he focused on painting, producing 4-track recordings he had made while working on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and writing short stories and screenplays. To cope with his worsening depression, Frusciante increased his heroin use and spiraled into a life-threatening dependency. His use of heroin to medicate his depression was a clear decision: [...] "I was very sad, and I was always happy when I was on drugs; therefore, I should be on drugs all the time. I was never guilty—I was always really proud to be an addict." [...] Frusciante openly admitted to being a [...] "junkie", believing that drugs were the only way of [...] "making sure you stay in touch with beauty instead of letting the ugliness of the world corrupt your soul." ...|$|E
500|$|While Margaret and Carrossea {{perform the}} ritual, Madlax is {{attacked}} by Limelda Jorg, a Gazth-Sonikan sniper {{who holds a}} grudge against Madlax ever since she failed to stop an assassination by Madlax earlier in the show. Limelda kills Vanessa while targeting Madlax, sending the latter into clinical depression. Elenore and Lady Quanzitta's servant Nakhl manage to restore Madlax's will to live and persuade her to save Margaret, and the three storm Enfant's headquarters together. During the assault, Elenore is killed and Margaret, now under Monday's control, shoots Madlax. Believing her to be dead, Monday commences a ritual to unleash people's inhibitions and trigger worldwide anarchy; but Margaret's memories return and she snaps <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> control. Only now does the audience learn the back-story: back in 1999, Monday drove Margaret's father insane with his powers and {{she was forced to}} kill her own father. To escape the horrible truth of her patricide, Margaret split herself into three personae: the [...] "memory keeper" [...] Laetitia, the sinful Madlax, and the innocent Margaret herself. Margaret then fuses her three personae back together to undo the ritual she previously performed with Monday, saving the world from insanity. Madlax, who should no longer exist after the fusion, appears and guns down Monday. It becomes apparent that Margaret has once again split herself into three, judging that after twelve years, she no longer has the right to make decisions for her other personae.|$|E
60|$|Silently Mr Powell {{inverted}} the holder, smothering {{the flame}} in the can, bringing {{about by the}} mere turn <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wrist the fall of darkness upon the poop. And {{at the same time}} vanished <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind's</b> eye the vision of another flame enormous and fierce shooting violently from a white churned patch of the sea, lighting up the very clouds and carrying upwards in its volcanic rush flying spars, corpses, the fragments of two destroyed ships. It vanished and there was an immense relief. He told me {{he did not know how}} scared he had been, not generally but of that very thing his imagination had conjured, till it was all over. He measured it (for fear is a great tension) by the feeling of slack weariness which came over him all at once.|$|R

50|$|After this {{experience}} John Sung now {{felt that he}} possessed more strength and fervently preached the Gospel to people he met. John became a radically changed man and began to preach fervently to his peers and lecturers in the seminary. It was such a drastic change in the man that his fellow liberal theology students reckoned that he had gone <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> right <b>mind,</b> and the seminary authorities confined him in an insane asylum, where he stayed for 193 days.|$|R
500|$|In a {{positive}} review published in Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, describing Spectre as [...] "party time for Bond fans, a fierce, funny, gorgeously produced valentine to the longest-running franchise in movies". Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle, raved that [...] "One {{of the great}} satisfactions of Spectre is that, {{in addition to all}} the stirring action, and all the timely references to a secret organization out to steal everyone's personal information, we get to believe in Bond as a person." [...] Stephen Whitty from The New York Daily News, who awarded the film four of five stars, stated that [...] "Craig is cruelly efficient. Dave Bautista makes a good, Oddjob-like assassin. And while Lea Seydoux doesn't leave a huge impression as this film's 'Bond girl', perhaps it's because we've already met—far too briefly—the hypnotic Monica Bellucci, as the first real 'Bond woman' since Diana Rigg." [...] Chicago Sun-Times film reviewer Richard Roeper, who gave the film three stars out of four, considered the film [...] "solidly {{in the middle of the}} all-time rankings, which means it's still a slick, beautifully photographed, action-packed, international thriller with a number of wonderfully, ludicrously entertaining set pieces, a sprinkling of dry wit, myriad gorgeous women and a classic psycho-villain who is clearly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> but seems to like it that way." [...] Michael Phillips, reviewing for the Chicago Tribune, stated, [...] "For all its workmanlike devotion to out-of-control helicopters, Spectre works best when everyone's on the ground, doing his or her job, driving expensive fast cars heedlessly, detonating the occasional wisecrack, enjoying themselves and their beautiful clothes." [...] Variety film critic Guy Lodge complained in his review that [...] "What's missing is the unexpected emotional urgency of Skyfall, as the film sustains its predecessor's nostalgia kick with a less sentimental bent." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "She Loves You" [...] is {{the song}} that thrust the Beatles {{full-scale}} into the British national spotlight.

[...] As Nicholas Schaffner later wrote, it was [...] "'yeah, yeah, yeah' chanted repeatedly and emphatically enough to drive any listener <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> one way or the other." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{expedition}} {{lasted from}} March 1858 {{until the middle}} of 1864. Expedition members recorded that Livingstone was an inept leader incapable of managing a large-scale project. He was also said to be secretive, self-righteous, and moody, and could not tolerate criticism, all of which severely strained the expedition and which led to his physician John Kirk writing in 1862, [...] "I can come to no other conclusion than that Dr. Livingstone is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> and a most unsafe leader".|$|E

He had encountered a character different from any he had yet met, had listened to new views, and his intelligence had been stimulated by remarks made casually, in easy conversation, and yet to him pregnant with novel and sometimes serious meaning. The voice, too, lingered in his ear, so hushed and deep, and yet so clear and sweet. He leaned over his mantel-piece in teeming reverie.|$|R

60|$|While {{his father}} and the {{visitors}} were holding deep consultations about public affairs, little Ben would sit on his stool in a corner, listening with the greatest interest, as if he understood every word. Indeed, his features were so full of intelligence {{that there could be}} but little doubt, not only that he understood what was said, but that he could have expressed some very sagacious opinions <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own <b>mind.</b> But in those days boys were expected to be silent in the presence of their elders.

Neff deduces she is contemplating murder, and makes it clear he wants no part of it. [...] However, he cannot get her <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> and when Phyllis shows up at his apartment, he cannot resist her any longer. Neff knows all the tricks of his trade and devises a plan to make {{the murder of her}} husband appear to be an accidental fall from a train that will trigger the [...] "double indemnity" [...] clause and pay out twice the policy's face value.|$|E

However, EA was more enthusiastic. Steven Levy wrote: [...] "Wright’s games were so different from EA’s other releases {{that it was hard}} to imagine the two being united in the same enterprise." [...] However, the success of SimCity had already established Sim as a strong brand, and EA, which by then, fifteen years after its founding, was becoming a Procter & Gamble-style brand-management company, foresaw the possibility of building a Sim franchise.|$|E
