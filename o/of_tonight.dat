25|$|NBC's Tonight was {{the late-night}} {{counterpart}} to its early-morning show Today. Originating in 1953 with host Steve Allen, Tonight was somewhat experimental at the time, {{as the only}} previous network late-night program was NBC's Broadway Open House which starred Jerry Lester and Dagmar. Tonight was successful, and when Allen moved on to primetime comedy-variety shows in 1956, Jack Paar replaced him as host <b>of</b> <b>Tonight.</b> Paar left the show in 1962.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the rise}} in fame and success from his 1983 album Let's Dance and its {{subsequent}} Serious Moonlight Tour, Bowie felt disconnected from his new found large fan base, and after the poor reception <b>of</b> <b>Tonight</b> (1984), he was looking to make the next album differently. As a result, Bowie {{said he wanted to}} return to recording with a small rock group like he had early in his career, and that he made the album as a [...] "move back to rock 'n' roll music. Very directly." [...] Bowie felt that the sound and style of his new album was reminiscent of his album Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps) (1980) and was less like its immediate predecessors.|$|E

Later in the month, Muccino left the project because of an incompatibility with filming the story. Since Muccino was preparing The Pursuit of Happyness, the studio had delayed the production start for Tonight, He Comes to summer 2007, enabling Warner Bros. to begin production of I Am Legend with Smith.|$|E

2500|$|The Gemara deduced {{from the}} words, [...] "About midnight I {{will go out}} into the midst of Egypt," [...] in [...] that even Moses did not know exactly when midnight fell. The Gemara {{reasoned}} that [...] could not say [...] "about midnight" [...] because God told Moses [...] "about midnight," [...] for God cannot have any doubt about when midnight falls. Thus the Gemara concluded that God told Moses [...] "at midnight," [...] and then Moses told Pharaoh [...] "about midnight" [...] because Moses was in doubt as to the exact moment of midnight..

Lauterbach, volume 1, page 67. But Rav Zeira argued that Moses certainly knew the exact time of midnight, but said [...] "about midnight" [...] because he thought that Pharaoh's astrologers might make a mistake as to the exact moment of midnight and then accuse Moses of being a liar. And Rav Ashi argued that in [...] Moses spoke at midnight of the night of the thirteenth of Nisan as it became the fourteenth of Nisan, and thus Moses said: [...] "God said: ‘Tomorrow at the hour like the midnight <b>of</b> <b>tonight,</b> I will {{go out into the}} midst of Egypt.'".|$|E
