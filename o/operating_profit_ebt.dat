30|$|In this paper, we {{classify}} firms {{into four}} groups {{according to the}} values of <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> margin and asset turnover each year. We identify the group of firms with higher <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> margins and lower asset turnover as firms that adopt a product differentiation strategy and the ones with lower <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> margins and higher asset turnover as firms with a cost leadership strategy. The <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> margin is measured as <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> divided by <b>operating</b> income (OPROF), while asset turnover is measured as operating income divided by average net fixed assets (ATURN). We also argue that the strategic positions should be persistent over years. If firms change strategy, their R&D spending likely change as well.|$|R

40|$|This article investigates whether high-growth firms grow in {{different}} ways from other firms. Specifically, we analyze how firms grow along several dimensions (growth of sales, employment, assets, and <b>operating</b> <b>profits)</b> using Structural Vector Autoregressions. Causal relations are identified by using information contained in the (non-Gaussian) growth rate distributions. For most firms, the growth process starts with employment growth, which is then followed by sales growth, then growth of <b>operating</b> <b>profits,</b> and finally growth of assets. In contrast, high growth firms put more emphasis on growth of <b>operating</b> <b>profits</b> driving other dimensions of growth, with employment growth occurring at the end...|$|R

40|$|Pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) is a {{promising}} technology {{to reduce the}} specific energy consumption and the operating expenditure of a seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plant. In this study, a simple analytical PRO model is developed to predict the PRO performance as the dilution of draw solutions occurs. The model can predict the PRO performance with a high accuracy without carrying out complicated integrations and experiments. The <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> of SWRO-PRO is also studied by calculating the profit generated for every m 3 of seawater entering the process because maximizing the <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> is the uttermost objective of the SWRO-PRO process. Based on the PRO analytical model, the <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> and {{the dynamics of the}} SWRO-PRO process, a strategy has been proposed to maximize the <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> of the SWRO-PRO process while maintaining the highest power density of the PRO membranes. This study proves that integration of SWRO with PRO can (1) push the SWRO to a higher recovery and maintain its high profitability, (2) effectively reduce the specific energy consumption of desalination by up to 35 % and (3) increase the <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> up to 100 %. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
