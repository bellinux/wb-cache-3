40|$|The Doppler lidar (DL) is {{an active}} remote sensing {{instrument}} that provides range- and time-resolved measurements of radial velocity and attenuated backscatter. The principle of operation is similar to radar in that pulses of energy are transmitted into the atmosphere; the energy scattered back to the transceiver is collected and measured as a time-resolved signal. From the time delay between each outgoing transmitted pulse and the backscattered signal, {{the distance to the}} scatterer is inferred. The radial or line-of-sight velocity of the scatterers is determined from the Doppler frequency shift of the backscattered radiation. The DL uses a heterodyne detection technique in which the return signal is mixed with a reference laser beam (i. e., local oscillator) of known frequency.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 14 - 16, 1980 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaTwo-way {{electronic}} communications to mobile platforms {{was initially}} {{provided in the}} HF (3 - 30 MHz) band. Then, as electronics technology progressed and requirements for increased link availability and capacity emerged, service evolved into the VHF (30 - 300 MHz), UHF (0. 300 - 3 GHz), and SHF bands (3 - 30 GHz), with the latter two often involving satellite-based systems. Recently, considerable consideration {{has been given to}} utilizing satellite communications systems operating in the allocated EHF (30 - 300 GHz) bands to provide wide-area coverage, to overcome frequency congestion difficulties, and to provide sufficient bandwidth for projected capacity increases and for interference protection via spread-spectrum modulation techniques.

30|$|The UWB {{sensor network}} {{dedicated}} to short-range detection and tracking of multiple persons (e.g. [39]) {{consists of a}} set of basic nodes and a central node (a data fusion center) connected by a WLAN. As the basic nodes, the single UWB radars equipped with one transmitting and two receiving antennas and an <b>onboard</b> <b>signal</b> processor unit are assumed. This concept of the UWB radar network allows modification of the network node number in a flexible way. The main advantage of the sensor network created in such a way is the possibility of using the same signal processing procedure for tracking of multiple moving targets as that described in Section 2 (Fig. 7, Fig. 8). The raw signals acquired by every node of the UWB sensor network are independently processed up to the localization phase. Then, the coordinates of the detected targets estimated by the particular nodes are provided to the fusion center (central node). There the target coordinates are time-synchronized and transformed into the common coordinate system. On the basis of data fused in this manner, the final target tracks are estimated by the same MTT system {{as in the case of}} the single sensor application (Section 2). More details about the concept of the UWB sensor network as well as achieved experimental results can be found in [31, 39, 42].|$|R

During this period, military systems have progressed through a family of increasingly more capable satellites and so have arrived at a very mature state. To start, a historical overview of mil-itary communications by satellites and {{a detailed description of}} current systems are provided. The capabilities of the present sys-tems are reviewed in relation to user requirements and threats.

High-gain satellite anten-nas with many simultaneous spot beams and <b>onboard</b> <b>signal</b> pro-cessing are the two important areas of technology for alleviating the shortcomings of present systems.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{wireless}} sensor networking {{has become a}} key technology for making pervasive communications a reality. To this end, wireless sensor nodes need to consume as less energy as possible and, thus, the complexity of any <b>onboard</b> <b>signal</b> processing operation needs to be kept as low as possible. In this paper, we present a low-complexity detection approach for the recognition of different audio signal patterns, expedient, for example, for intrusion control in critical areas. To this end, the proposed detection algorithm evolves through two main processing phases: (a) coarse and (b) fine. The evolution between these two phases is described through a finite state machine (FSM) model. In fact, fine processing (in the frequency domain) is carried out only when an “atypical” audio signal is detected. On the other hand, coarse processing (in the time domain), performed {{a larger number of}} times, has a much lower complexity. Our results show that our processing technique allows to detect efficiently the presence of signals of interest (identified by properly selected spectral signatures) and to reliably distinguish different audio signal patterns, e. g., between speech and non-speech signals.
