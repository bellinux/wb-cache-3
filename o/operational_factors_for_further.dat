40|$|Environmental {{regulators}} {{often use}} environmental policy to induce green investment by firms. However, if an environmental policy fails to exert a long-run effect on regulating the economic agents’ behavior, {{it may be}} more reasonable to think of the firm as the leader in the game, since the investment in green technology is usually a strategic decision. In this paper, we consider a three-stage Stackelberg game to address the interaction between a profit-maximizing firm (Stackelberg leader) facing emission-dependent demand, and the environmental regulator (Stackelberg follower). The firm decides on the green technology level in the first stage of the game based on its understanding of the regulator’s profits function, especially an environmental concern that is introduced as an exogenous variable. In the current research, we show that high levels of the regulator’s environmental concerns do not necessarily lead to the choice of green technology by the firm, and green investment level depends on the combined effects of the market and <b>operational</b> <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> a given level of the regulator’s environmental concerns. The result also shows that increasing environmental awareness amongst the consumers is an effective way to drive the firm’s green investment...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a report}} [© Transportation Research Board]. The {{definitive}} version is available from: [URL] Report 3 : Analysis of Aircraft Overruns and Undershoots for Runway Safety Areas covers four areas: (1) Research collected on accident/incident data from several notable sources; (2) inventory of the conditions relating to each; (3) assessment of risk {{in relation to the}} runway safety area; and (4) discussion on a set of alternatives to the traditional runway safety area. Overruns and undershoots are factors in the design or improvement of runway safety areas (RSAs). The traditional approach to mitigate risk associated with accidents or incidents is to enlarge the runway safety area, but many airports do not have sufficient land to accommodate standard Federal Aviation Administration or International Civil Aviation Organization recommendations for RSAs. Airports that pursue this approach face extremely expensive and controversial land acquisition or wetlands filling projects to make sufficient land available. This report uses a probabilistic approach—a quantitative assessment—to analyze the RSA and begins a discussion on how alternatives to a standard 1, 000 -foot RSA may adequately mitigate risk. The report also assesses the factors that increase the risk of such accidents occurring, helps with understanding how these incidents may happen, and suggests that aircraft overrun and undershoot risks are related to specific <b>operational</b> <b>factors.</b> The report suggests that significant improvement to airport operations safety may be achieved by monitoring and managing these <b>operational</b> <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> both RSA planning and during actual aircraft operations, and it provides recommendations for collection and reporting of data in future accident and incident investigations and reporting to allow future improvements to these models...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{perinatal}} outcomes and risk <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> <b>further</b> pregnancy loss {{in patients with}} recurrent miscarriage treated with lymphocyte immunotherapy (LIT). Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study of women {{with a history of}} two or more consecutive miscarriages who underwent LIT. All patients had undergone investigation of the etiology of the pregnancy losses according to a specific protocol. These etiologic factors were compared between those whose pregnancy outcome was successful and those who had a further miscarriage. The comparison between the groups was performed by Kruskal-Wallis, Fisher exact and Chi-square tests. Perinatal outcome data were collected for the successful pregnancies. Results: One-hundred six patients were included. The mean number (+/-SD) of previous pregnancies, deliveries and miscarriages in all patients were 2. 73 +/- 0. 8, 0. 19 +/- 0. 4 and 2. 54 +/- 0. 6, respectively. A successful pregnancy outcome after lymphocyte therapy occurred in 82 patients (group I), while 24 (22. 6 %) sustained a further miscarriage (group II). There was no statistical difference in the genetic, anatomic and hormonal causes of miscarriage between the groups (p > 0. 05). Antinuclear (ANA) and antithyroglobulin (TgAb) autoantibodies occurred more frequently in group II (p = 0. 0010 and p = 0. 0024, respectively). Of those with successful pregnancies, 11 women (13. 4 %) had a preterm delivery. The mean birth weight was 3036. 4 +/- 498. 6 g.
