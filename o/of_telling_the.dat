5|$|Meanwhile, Donna {{returns home}} to warn her mother, Sylvia (Jacqueline King), and {{grandfather}} Wilfred Mott (Bernard Cribbins) about the Doctor, having been advised {{to do so}} by Martha. Concerned about the implications <b>of</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> truth, Donna decides against warning her mother. The Doctor investigates the ATMOS device attached to Donna's car and discovers a secondary function: the device can emit a poisonous gas. Wilfred attempts to take the car off the road, but is trapped when Staal activates all 400 million ATMOS devices installed in cars worldwide. The episode's cliffhanger depicts Donna shouting for help while the Doctor stares helplessly at a street full of cars emitting the gas, while on their ship orbiting the planet, the Sontarans prepare themselves for battle.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} codes, Han law distinguished {{what should be}} considered murderous killings (with malice and foresight), wittingly killing, killing by mistake, and killing by accident. Although a father was the undisputed head of the family, he {{was not allowed to}} mutilate or kill any of its members as punishment; if he did, he would be tried for physical assault or murder, respectively. Yet not all murders were given the same sentence, since relation and circumstance were considered in the sentencing. For example, A father would be given a much less severe sentence for murdering a son than if a son murdered his father. Women had certain rights under Han law. It was against the law for husbands to physically abuse their wives. Rape cases were also commonly filed in court and were punished by Han law. Women could level charges against men in court, while it was commonly accepted in Han jurisprudence that women were capable <b>of</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> truth in court.|$|E
5|$|Corvus is {{associated}} with the myth of Apollo and his lover Coronis the Lapith. Coronis had been unfaithful to Apollo; when he learned this information from a pure white crow, he turned its feathers black in a fit of rage. Another legend associated with Corvus is that a crow stopped on his way to fetch water for Apollo, to eat figs. Instead <b>of</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> truth to Apollo, he lied and said that a snake, Hydra, kept him from the water, while holding a snake in his talons as proof. Apollo, realizing this was a lie, flung the crow (Corvus), cup (Crater), and snake (Hydra) into the sky. He further punished the wayward bird by ensuring it would forever be thirsty, both in real life and in the heavens, where the Cup is just out of reach.|$|E

5|$|The wildebeests, {{also called}} gnus, are a genus of antelopes, {{scientific}} name Connochaetes. They {{belong to the}} family Bovidae, which includes antelopes, cattle, goats, sheep and other even-toed horned ungulates. Connochaetes includes two species, both native to Africa: the black wildebeest, or white-tailed gnu (C. gnou); and the blue wildebeest, or brindled gnu (C. taurinus). Fossil records suggest these two species diverged about one million years ago, resulting in a northern and a southern species. The blue wildebeest remained in its original range and changed very little from the ancestral species, while the black wildebeest changed more in order to adapt to its open grassland habitat in the south. The most obvious way <b>of</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> two species apart are the differences in their colouring {{and in the way}} their horns are oriented.|$|E
5|$|They {{pitched a}} number of live-action ideas to Kanbar and {{proposed}} that he invest in a development division of their company, paying them and covering their rent {{in exchange for a}} significant portion of the rights to any scripts that they might sell. Kanbar however, was interested in a more direct approach, and preferred to focus on trying to produce a single film. He had always been a great admirer of animation and was impressed after being shown a direct-to-DVD computer-animated short film that Cory had made called Wobots. He suggested the possibility of producing an animated feature with them that would tell a familiar story with a twist, and gave them a month to come up with a story idea. Kanbar had expressed interest in Cinderella or Pinocchio, but the Edwards brothers did not like these ideas as they had already been done by Walt Disney. A few days after the brothers' initial meeting with Kanbar, Todd found inspiration in non-linear crime dramas, such as Rashomon, Pulp Fiction, Run Lola Run, and Memento and came up with the idea <b>of</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood as a police investigation, using multiple points of view.|$|E

25|$|In {{the wake}} of the Seven Years' War, the American Revolution began across the Atlantic. Britain's victory against France and its allies in the war made the French feel {{vulnerable}} to British power. The French saw the American Revolution as a way to strengthen itself and cripple the British Empire. At the beginning, the French helped fuel the American war effort but never came out as an official ally {{on the side of the}} Americans. American envoys to France, namely Silas Deane, feared that the French would never join the war. They were so fearful, they thought <b>of</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> French that if the French didn't sufficiently support the war effort, the Americans would begin peace talks with Britain.|$|E
500|$|Spook Country explores themes {{relating}} to espionage, war profiteering and esoteric martial artistry, {{as well as}} familiar themes from the author's previous novels such as the unintended uses for which technology is employed (e.g. locative art) {{and the nature of}} celebrity. The author's preoccupation with semiotics and apophenia in Pattern Recognition is carried over in the sequel. In a review for The Guardian, Steven Poole observed that [...] "This is a novel about, and also full of, ghost-signs, or signs that may not be signs, and about the difficulty <b>of</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> difference. Gibson delights in saturating the pages with data {{that may or may not}} encode clues for the reader." ...|$|E

A.O. Scott of The New York Times also disliked the film, calling it [...] "an example of the programmed triumph of commercial calculation over imagination". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times had mixed feelings, describing the film as [...] "an aesthetic stand-off between predictable elements and unexpected ones". [...] Turan praised the performances of Hemsworth, Hopkins, and Elba, but found the special effects inconsistent and the Earth storyline derivative.|$|E

It was initially not known where [...] "AF" [...] was, but Commander Joseph Rochefort and his team at Station HYPO were able to confirm that it was Midway: Captain Wilfred Holmes devised a ruse <b>of</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> base at Midway (by secure undersea cable) to broadcast an uncoded radio message stating that Midway's water purification system had broken down.

500|$|Martin is firm about {{ending the}} {{series with the}} seventh novel [...] "until I decide not to be firm". With his stated goal <b>of</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> story from {{beginning}} to end, he will not truncate the story to fit into an arbitrary number of volumes. He knows the ending in broad strokes {{as well as the}} future of the main characters, and will finish the series with bittersweet elements where not everyone will live happily ever after. Martin hopes to write an ending similar to The Lord of the Rings that he felt gave the story a satisfying depth and resonance. On the other hand, Martin noted the challenge to avoid a situation like the finale of the TV series Lost, which left some fans disappointed by deviating too far from their own theories and desires. In 2015, Martin said that he was not writing A Dream of Spring together with The Winds of Winter, and in early 2016, {{he said he did not}} believe A Dream of Spring would be published before the last season of the HBO show.|$|E

500|$|Straczynski viewed [...] "sitting {{down and}} ferreting out [...] story" [...] as {{a return to}} his journalistic roots. He also drew on his {{experience}} writing crime drama for the procedural elements of the plot. Straczynski said he had gathered so much information about the case {{that it was difficult}} to work out how to tell it. To let the story develop at its own pace, he put the project aside to allow himself to forget the less essential elements and bring into focus the parts he wanted to tell. He described what he saw as two overlaid triangles: [...] "the first triangle, with the point up, is Collins' story. You start with her, and her story gets broader and broader and begins having impact from all kinds of places. The overlay on that was an upside down triangle with the base on top, which is the panorama of Los Angeles at that timeâ1928. And it begins getting narrower and narrower toward the bottom, bearing down on her." [...] Once Straczynski saw this structure, he felt he could write the story. He chose to avoid focusing on the atrocities of the Wineville murders in favor <b>of</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> story from Collins' perspective; Straczynski said she was {{the only person in the}} story without a hidden agenda, and it was her tenacityâas well as the legacy the case left throughout California's legal systemâthat had attracted him to the project. He said, [...] "My intention was very simple: to honor what Christine Collins did." ...|$|E
500|$|Gilbert Adair, {{writing in}} a review for Full Metal Jacket, commented that [...] "Kubrick's {{approach}} to language has always been of a reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic nature. He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all whims, shades and modulations of personal expression". Johnson notes that although Kubrick was a [...] "visual filmmaker", he also loved words and was like a writer in his approach, very sensitive to the story itself, which he found unique. Before shooting began, Kubrick tried to have the script as complete as possible, but still allowed himself enough space to make changes during the filming, finding it [...] "more profitable to avoid locking up any ideas about staging or camera or even dialogue prior to rehearsals" [...] as he put it. Kubrick told Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "I {{think you have to}} view the entire problem of putting the story you want to tell up there on that light square. It begins with the selection of the property; it continues through the creation of the story, the sets, the costumes, the photography and the acting. And when the picture is shot, it's only partially finished. I think the cutting is just a continuation of directing a movie. I think the use of music effects, opticals and finally main titles are all part <b>of</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> story. And I think the fragmentation of these jobs, by different people, is a very bad thing". Kubrick also said: [...] "I think that the best plot is no apparent plot. I like a slow start, the start that gets under the audience's skin and involves them so that they can appreciate grace notes and soft tones and don't have to be pounded over the head with plot points and suspense tools." ...|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Lo {{summarised}} the storyline of the EP; [...] "The song 'Love Ballad' {{is about}} the moment you decide to give everything to another person, while 'Habits' shows what happens when everything is screwed up and {{you just want to}} freak out. 'Out of Mind' deals with the stage after that, when your broken heart has mended, but the scars are still there". The EP's main genres are pop, electropop and indie pop. The Swedish edition of Truth Serum opens with [...] "Love Ballad", a pop song with drum instrumentation. It was described as a [...] "parody of love songs" [...] that talks about the [...] "carefree beginnings of a new romance". Lo also called it a [...] "way <b>of</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> one I love I'd do anything for him". In the standard edition, the EP opens with [...] "Not on Drugs", a pop, dance and electropop song in which the artist compares falling in love to being under the influence of drugs. Following the narrative of Truth Serum, it represents the happy beginning of the relationship, when Lo was [...] "really in love" [...] and [...] " [...] think straight". [...] "Paradise" [...] is a jungle and drum and bass song with electronic elements; it talks about the moment when Lo realizes that she needs and relies on her partner. The electropop song [...] "Over" [...] details the part when Lo and her boyfriend end the relationship. The singer stated that it was about [...] "me making a big mistake and having to confess and come clean". [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] is a pop and electropop track which talks about the artist's hedonistic attempts to forget her former boyfriend. [...] "Out of Mind" [...] is a pop song with minimal instrumentation. According to Lo, it represents the part when [...] "I have the pain and I'm trying to get over this heartbreak. It's when you moved on and you're sort of okay, but you still have that little scar". The EP's last track is the downtempo [...] "Stay High", a remix version of [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] by record production duo Hippie Sabotage.|$|E
