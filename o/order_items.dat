2500|$|Among Boas's main {{contributions}} to anthropological thought was his {{rejection of the}} then popular evolutionary approaches {{to the study of}} culture, which saw all societies progressing through a set of hierarchic technological and cultural stages, with Western European culture at the summit. Boas argued that culture developed historically through the interactions of groups of people and the diffusion of ideas, and that consequently there was no process towards continuously [...] "higher" [...] cultural forms. This insight led Boas to reject the [...] "stage"-based organization of ethnological museums, instead preferring to <b>order</b> <b>items</b> on display based on the affinity and proximity of the cultural groups in question.|$|E
2500|$|When Fisher and {{his four}} {{brothers}} came of age, their father named the business [...] "Joshua Fisher & Sons" [...] (1762–1783), and engaged the brothers {{in all aspects}} of it. Customers were able to <b>order</b> <b>items</b> such as porcelain, silverware, brass pulls for dressers, and every other imaginable type of merchandise from a detailed catalog. [...] The business prospered because customers could receive reasonably priced goods within weeks. [...] Fisher eventually took over most of the business from his father and brothers, continuing {{for the rest of his}} life to run the packet line to London. He traveled widely in America and England (1767-8) and made notes on the manufacture of textile, glassware, and ceramic items for inclusion in the catalog.|$|E
50|$|A {{combination}} meal, {{also referred}} to as a combo meal, is a type of meal that typically includes food items and a beverage. They are a common menu item at fast food restaurants, and other restaurants also purvey them. Combination meals may be priced lower compared to <b>ordering</b> <b>items</b> separately, but this is not always the case. A combination meal is also a meal in which the consumer <b>orders</b> <b>items</b> à la carte to create their own meal combination. The casada is a common type of lunch combination meal in Costa Rica and Panama.|$|R
5000|$|Combination meals may be priced lower {{compared}} to <b>ordering</b> the <b>items</b> separately, and this lower pricing {{may serve to}} entice consumers that are budget-minded. A 2010 {{study published in the}} Journal of Public Policy & Marketing found that some consumers may order a combination meal even if no price discount is applied {{compared to}} the price of <b>ordering</b> <b>items</b> separately. The study found that this behavior is based upon consumers perceiving an inherent value in combination meals, and also suggested that the ease and convenience of ordering, such as ordering a meal by number, plays a role compared to <b>ordering</b> <b>items</b> separately. This study also found that the presence of combination meals encourages consumers to increase meal portion size by supersizing their meals.|$|R

40|$|Inventory systems where {{customers}} join waiting line {{to receive}} their demanded items are recently considered by many researchers, as these models allow the study of both queue length {{and size of the}} inventory. This article considers a continuous review inventory system at a service facility, wherein an item demanded by a customer is issued to him/her only after performing service of random duration on the item. The service facility is assumed to have waiting hall of infinite size. The arrival time points of customers form a renewal process. The service times are assumed to be distributed as negative exponential. The operating policy is (s,S) policy with instantaneous supply of <b>ordered</b> <b>items.</b> We consider two models which differ in the way that <b>ordered</b> <b>items,</b> when received, is brought into the stock. In the first model, the <b>ordered</b> <b>items</b> are brought into the stock immediately. In the second model, the supplied items are brought into the stock only at the next demand epoch. The stationary distribution of the underlying Markov chain is obtained in matrix-geometric form. The joint probability distribution of the number of customers in the system and the inventory level is obtained in the steady-state case. ...|$|R
