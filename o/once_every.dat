5|$|In Hungary, mating {{takes place}} in the last week of April, while in the north it happens later in the second week of May. Matings have also been {{observed}} in June and even early October, but it is not known if the autumn matings result in any young. Females often breed <b>once</b> <b>every</b> two years, or even <b>once</b> <b>every</b> three years if the seasons are short and the climate is severe.|$|E

5|$|The Australian swellshark is oviparous. Males have larger teeth than females, {{with which}} to bite and hold onto them for copulation. Whether there is a {{specific}} mating season is uncertain, though in terms of sperm production males are capable of breeding year-round. Females have a single functional ovary and two oviducts, ovulating a single egg into each at a time. They can store sperm for at least 15 months. Females produce eggs throughout the year, laying them in pairs approximately <b>once</b> <b>every</b> 20 days from January to June, and <b>once</b> <b>every</b> 30 days {{the rest of the}} year. The second egg in a pair is deposited 1224 hours after the first.|$|E

5|$|The Moon makes a {{complete}} orbit around Earth {{with respect to}} the fixed stars about <b>once</b> <b>every</b> 27.3days (its sidereal period). However, because Earth is moving in its orbit around the Sun at the same time, it takes slightly longer for the Moon to show the same phase to Earth, which is about 29.5days (its synodic period). Unlike most satellites of other planets, the Moon orbits closer to the ecliptic plane than to the planet's equatorial plane. The Moon's orbit is subtly perturbed by the Sun and Earth in many small, complex and interacting ways. For example, the plane of the Moon's orbit gradually rotates <b>once</b> <b>every</b> 18.61 years, which affects other aspects of lunar motion. These follow-on effects are mathematically described by Cassini's laws.|$|E
5|$|The sultanate of Oman, {{located on}} the southeastern corner of the Arabian Peninsula, {{regularly}} receives the impacts of tropical cyclones due to its long coastline along the Arabian Sea. On average, storms strike Oman <b>once</b> <b>every</b> three years, mostly between Masirah Island and Salalah, and usually before June or after October. From 1943 to 1967, tropical cyclones accounted for about 25% of Salalah's overall rainfall. About <b>once</b> <b>every</b> five years, a storm affects the Dhofar region of southern Oman, and Oman's capital of Muscat about <b>once</b> <b>every</b> ten years in. Between 1890 and 1996, 36storms struck Oman, although some landfalling storms might be excluded from the historical record {{due to the lack}} of population centers. In addition, storm intensities at landfall have only been accurately known since around 1979, and reliable record keeping began around 1970. In 2014, an archaeology team discovered evidence that a major flood affected Ras Al Hadd in eastern Oman, possibly the result of a tsunami or a severe storm.|$|E

5|$|Category5 hurricanes are {{tropical}} cyclones {{that reach}} Category5 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. They are by definition the strongest hurricanes that can form on planet Earth. They are {{rare in the}} eastern Pacific Ocean and generally form only <b>once</b> <b>every</b> several years. In general, Category5s form in clusters in single years. Landfalls by such storms are rare due to the generally westerly path of tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere.|$|E

Open splenectomy has been performed with low morbidity in Jamaican children with the SS genotype (1, 6, 7 – 9), which occurs <b>once</b> in <b>every</b> 300 Jamaican births (10) Sickle cell disease includes not only genotypic homo-zygotes (SS) but also the double heterozygotes (SC, S β 0 and S β+ thalassaemias) (10, 11).

Haemoglobin SC disease, which occurs <b>once</b> in <b>every</b> 500 Jamaican births, causes splenic complications only rarely (10). The genotypes S β 0 thalassaemia and S β+ thalassaemia are rare in the Jamaican population, occurring <b>once</b> in <b>every</b> 7000 and <b>once</b> in <b>every</b> 3000 births respectively, but their propensity for splenic complications is high (10).
