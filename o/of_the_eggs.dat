5|$|A {{recent study}} shows that both food {{availability}} and temperature affect the parental incubation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> in northern mockingbirds. Increasing food availability provides the females with more time {{to care for the}} nest and perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost to cool the eggs. The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, Mikhailov {{suggested}} that Macroolithus represented the eggs {{of a large}} theropod, specifically Tarbosaurus, based on the large size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> and the largely overlapping distribution.

Oviraptorid parentage was confirmed for Macroolithus when, in 2008, oviraptorid embryos resembling Heyuannia were discovered inside a pair of M. yaotunensis eggs in Jiangxi.|$|E

5|$|Some frogs {{protect their}} {{offspring}} inside their own bodies. Both {{male and female}} pouched frogs (Assa darlingtoni) guard their eggs, which are laid on the ground. When the eggs hatch, the male lubricates his body with the jelly surrounding them and immerses himself in the egg mass. The tadpoles wriggle into skin pouches on his side, where they develop until they metamorphose into juvenile frogs. The female gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus sp.) from Australia, now probably extinct, swallows her fertilized eggs, which then develop inside her stomach. She ceases to feed and stops secreting stomach acid. The tadpoles rely on the yolks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> for nourishment. After six or seven weeks, they are ready for metamorphosis. The mother regurgitates the tiny frogs, which hop away from her mouth. The female Darwin's frog (Rhinoderma darwinii) from Chile lays up to 40 eggs on the ground, where they are guarded by the male. When the tadpoles are about to hatch, they are engulfed by the male, which carries them around inside his much-enlarged vocal sac. Here they are immersed in a frothy, viscous liquid that contains some nourishment to supplement what they obtain from the yolks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eggs.</b> They remain in the sac for seven to ten weeks before undergoing metamorphosis, after which they move into the male's mouth and emerge.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of Chirocephalus diaphanus is {{extremely}} fast. The typical duration of a full life cycle is not known, but a figure of around 3 months has been suggested. The eggs are tolerant to drying out; when their habitat fills with water again, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> will hatch, while others remain dormant. This enables the species to continue to survive in an unpredictable habitat, since some eggs remain in case the habitat does not persist for {{long enough for the}} animals to mate and produce offspring.

40|$|Although {{activation}} {{of a sea}} urchin egg by sperm leads to three phases of membrane conductance increase in <b>the</b> <b>egg,</b> <b>the</b> mechanism by which the sperm causes these conductance changes is not known. We used the loose patch clamp technique to localize the conductance changes in voltage clamped <b>eggs.</b> A patch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg's</b> membrane was isolated from the bath by pressing the loose patch clamp pipette against <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> surface. Sperm added to the bath attached to <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> in a region other than at the isolated membrane patch. During phase 1 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> activation current, no changes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> membrane conductance were detected. At <b>the</b> time <b>of,</b> and subsequent to <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> phase 2, large currents recorded between <b>the</b> interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patch pipette and the bath were attributed to changes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seal resistance between <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> and <b>the</b> pipette. A local change of membrane conductance was observed during phase 2 despite <b>the</b> changes <b>of</b> seal resistance. During phase 2, the large amplitude and short duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local membrane conductance increase relative to the membrane, conductance increase for <b>the</b> whole <b>egg</b> during phase 2 indicated that the conductance increase occurred over <b>the</b> entire surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg,</b> but not simultaneously. The time when the peak conductance for the membrane patch occurred, relative to <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> onset for phase 2 in <b>the</b> whole <b>egg,</b> depended on <b>the</b> distance, measured in a straight line, between <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> sperm attachment and <b>the</b> tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pipette.

5|$|All beetle larvae {{go through}} several instars, {{which are the}} {{developmental}} stages between each moult. In many species, the larvae simply increase in size with each successive instar as more food is consumed. In some cases, however, more dramatic changes occur. Among certain beetle families or genera, particularly those that exhibit parasitic lifestyles, the first instar (the planidium) is highly mobile to search out a host, while the following instars are more sedentary and remain on or within their host. This is known as hypermetamorphosis; it occurs in the Meloidae, Micromalthidae, and Ripiphoridae. The blister beetle Epicauta vittata (Meloidae), for example, has three distinct larval stages. Its first stage, the triungulin, has longer legs to go in search <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> of grasshoppers. After feeding for a week it moults to the second stage, called the caraboid stage, which resembles the larva of a carabid beetle.

Its penultimate larval stage is the pseudo-pupa or the coarcate larva, which will overwinter and pupate until the next spring.|$|E

The worm was discovered in 1970 and formally described in 1987. Originally classified in the genus Capillaria, it was reclassified in Aonchotheca in 1999. A.forresteri is small and narrow-bodied, with a length of 13.8 to 19.4mm in females and 6.8 to 9.2mm in males.

5|$|Early on, paleontologists {{considered}} Macroolithus nests to {{have been}} buried. Mou 1992 noted the high gas conductance values in Macroolithus eggs and therefore concluded that they were laid in a very humid environment, buried underground or inside a mound. Deeming (2006) found a similar result. This seems to contradict evidence that oviraptorosaurids brooded bird-like on their eggs, but Deeming suggested that Oviraptor buried its eggs in a mound and then Oviraptor and its relatives sat atop a nest mound to incubate, rather than directly contacting the eggs. However, Tanaka et al. (2015) criticized these results for lack of statistical rigor. They found, based on comparisons to modern eggs, that Macroolithus was predicted to be laid in open or partially covered nests. Wiemann et al. (2017) also criticized Mou and Deeming because they had only measured eggshell porosity at the middle section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> and did {{not take into account}} the fact that the pore density is much lower near the poles.
