30|$|There are {{two ways}} to respond to <b>official</b> <b>channels</b> used to give a {{deceptive}} appearance of justice. One is to avoid or discredit the <b>official</b> <b>channels.</b> In the long term, discrediting the Nazi regime accomplished this, so much so that virtually any Nazi policy was discredited by association. The other response is to not rely on <b>official</b> <b>channels</b> for redress but instead to mobilise support among the public, for example by talking to individuals, publicising the issues, holding private or public meetings, forming networks and groups, and making public protests.|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the extent to}} which type and labeling of harassment have an impact on reporting through <b>official</b> <b>channels.</b> Reinforcing earlier analyses, type of harassment impacted whether individuals reported incidents officially. Environmental harassment was far more likely to be reported through <b>official</b> <b>channels.</b> We speculate that “individualized ” forms of harassment (personal, frequently directly physical in nature, leaving little room for misinterpretation by the victim or the perpetrator) may create a negative organizational image and therefore be more likely to be concealed. Since experiencing environmental harassment is strongly related to experiencing individualized harassment and {{is more likely to be}} reported through <b>official</b> <b>channels,</b> it may be the real key to creating zero-tolerance for any type of sexual harassment...|$|R

30|$|One {{value of}} this {{analysis}} is showing ways for challengers to increase outrage over practices they oppose. To do this, {{it is useful to}} expose the actions, validate those who are the targets, interpret the actions as unjust, mobilise support (and avoid or discredit <b>official</b> <b>channels),</b> and resist intimidation. Groups in the right-to-die movement have used most of these methods. It is noteworthy that many voluntary euthanasia groups put much of their energy into <b>official</b> <b>channels,</b> namely seeking law reform, which actually dampens outrage.|$|R

30|$|In this section, I have {{outlined}} the common tactics used by perpetrators to reduce outrage over euthanasia {{and some of}} the counter-tactics that can be used by those opposed to euthanasia. The Nazis, in killing {{hundreds of thousands of people}} with disabilities, used the full range of techniques for reducing outrage: cover-up, devaluation, reinterpretation, <b>official</b> <b>channels</b> and intimidation. On the other hand, individual doctors who practise euthanasia, where it is illegal, typically rely primarily on cover-up.
