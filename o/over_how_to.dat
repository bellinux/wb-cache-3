5|$|Japan's {{population}} {{is expected to}} drop to 95 million by 2050; demographers and government planners are currently in a heated debate <b>over</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> cope with this problem. Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested {{as a solution to}} provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population. Japan accepts an average flow of 9,500 new Japanese citizens by naturalization (帰化) per year. According to the UNHCR, in 2012 Japan accepted just 18 refugees for resettlement, while the United States took in 76,000.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{hold that}} Jesus lived in Galilee and Judea {{and did not}} preach or study elsewhere. They agree that Jesus debated with Jewish authorities {{on the subject of}} God, performed some healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. Jesus' Jewish critics considered his ministry to be scandalous because he feasted with sinners, fraternized with women, and allowed his followers to pluck grain on the Sabbath. According to Sanders, it is not plausible that disagreements <b>over</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> interpret the Law of Moses and the Sabbath would have led Jewish authorities to want Jesus killed.|$|E

5|$|A scout alerted Muhammad of the Meccan army's {{presence}} and numbers late on Thursday March 21. The next morning, a Muslim conference of war convened, {{and there was}} dispute <b>over</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> best repel the Meccans. Muhammad {{and many of the}} senior figures suggested that it would be safer to fight within Medina and take advantage of its heavily fortified strongholds. Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying their crops, and that huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to the wishes of the latter, and readied the Muslim force for battle.|$|E

5|$|Another {{design was}} {{requested}} of Brine, {{but this time}} for a smaller and less expensive building. In 1818, the Keys purchased the building {{in which they had}} formerly met, moving the library to the Grammar School. The new plans were agreed upon by all concerned, but there continued to be disagreements between the British Treasury department and the Keys <b>over</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> fund the project. The Treasury believed that the cost should be covered by Manx taxes, but the Keys argued that this tax would be excessive. The two parties eventually each agreed to pay some of the £1039-10-0d cost, and the project was approved on 31 May 1819, just under 30 years after the first discussions. The building was completed in less than two years, and the Keys started using the building in January 1821.|$|E
5|$|For the {{purposes}} of analysis, {{it is possible to}} separate efficiency (achieving a given objective at lowest cost) and equity (fairness). Economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full costs of their actions (that is, the full marginal social costs of their actions). Regulation of emissions that is applied only to one economic sector or region drastically reduces the efficiency of efforts to reduce global emissions. There is, however, no scientific consensus <b>over</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> share {{the costs and benefits of}} reducing future climate change (mitigation of climate change), or the costs and benefits of adapting to any future climate change (see also economics of global warming).|$|E

After Savimbi's death, the government {{came to a}} crossroads <b>over</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> proceed. After initially indicating the counter-insurgency might continue, the government announced it would halt all military operations on 13 March. Military commanders for UNITA and the MPLA met in Cassamba and agreed to a cease-fire. However, Carlos Morgado, UNITA's spokesman in Portugal, said the UNITA's Portugal wing had been under the impression General Kamorteiro, the UNITA general who agreed to the ceasefire, had been captured {{more than a week}} earlier. Morgado did say that he had not heard from Angola since Savimbi's death. The military commanders signed a Memorandum of Understanding as an addendum to the Lusaka Protocol in Luena on 4 April, with Santos and Lukambo observing.|$|E

While this overt military preparation was going on, covert stay-behind arrangements initially made by the Western European Union to continue resistance after a successful Soviet invasion, including Operation Gladio, were transferred to NATO control.

5|$|In {{the spring}} and summer of 1942, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin {{regularly}} toured villages in the Goražde, Kalinovik and Foča districts, encouraging the local civilians and Chetnik detachments to behave loyally towards the Italians. The Italians were unable to gain German support for their plan to use Chetnik groups as auxiliaries during the joint Italian-German anti-Partisan Operation Trio in April–May. In May, Jevđević met with German intelligence officers in Dubrovnik and was asked whether he would cooperate in the pacification of Bosnia. Mihailović was aware of and condoned the collaborationist arrangements entered into by Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin. Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin frequently met with Chetnik commander Momčilo Đujić in Split, and the three men quarrelled <b>over</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> divide the financial assistance they were receiving from the Italians.|$|E
5|$|Marx's {{ideas have}} had a {{profound}} impact on world politics and intellectual thought. Followers of Marx have frequently debated amongst themselves <b>over</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> interpret Marx's writings and apply his concepts to the modern world.

In the political realm, these tendencies include Leninism, Marxism–Leninism, Trotskyism, Maoism, Luxemburgism and libertarian Marxism. Various currents have also developed in academic Marxism, often under influence of other views, resulting in structuralist Marxism, historical Marxism, phenomenological Marxism, analytical Marxism and Hegelian Marxism.|$|E

That evening he held a meeting with his aides <b>over</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> get the attention of middle-class whites weary {{of the civil rights movement}} in order to relieve the racial tension in the country. Kennedy returned to Indiana and on April 10 delivered his third and final speech inspired by King's death.

Throughout the rest of the month, Kennedy toned down his campaign rhetoric and fixed on a theme of unity and reconciliation.|$|E

After considering the recommendations, the Dutch Government decided to acquire four battleships, and a bill seeking funding for them was introduced into the Dutch parliament in August 1914. However, this was withdrawn following the outbreak of the First World War that month. A new royal commission into Dutch defense needs held after the war did not recommend that battleships be procured and none were ever ordered.|$|E

A delay was also caused when Pryor {{suffered a heart attack}} in April 1991, and was replaced on the committee by Jeff Bingaman. Bingaman spent months learning the complex materials involved in the matter, only to resign in July due to a conflict of interest. Pryor was reassigned to the committee in August 1991, so as to not further delay its deliberations.|$|E

5|$|Tyrrell {{started making}} its own cars {{towards the end}} of 1970, and March's 1971 program in Formula One was much reduced, with no {{recognised}} front-running driver. The Firestone and STP sponsorship was insufficient and Mosley failed to attract a large backer for 1971. Motorsport author Mike Lawrence has suggested that the shortfall forced him into short-term deals, which maintained cashflow, but were not in the best long-term interests of the company. Mosley negotiated a deal for the team to use Alfa Romeo engines in a third car, bringing much needed funding. The engines proved uncompetitive, and his hopes of an ongoing partnership with the Italian automobile manufacturer were not met. Nonetheless, March again finished third in the constructors championship, and works driver Ronnie Peterson, in a Cosworth DFV-powered car, was second in the Drivers' Championship. March's financial woes continued: the company had lost £71,000 at the end of 1971. Mosley and Rees disagreed <b>over</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> rectify the situation and Rees left March early in 1972.|$|E
5|$|Until the Song dynasty took {{advantage}} of a large rebellion within the Liao Kingdom in 1125, the Song had to conduct cordial relations with the Liao. Skilled ambassadors were sent on missions to court the Liao and maintain peace, such as the renowned horologist, engineer, and state minister Su Song. The Song also prepared for armed conflict, increasing the overall size {{of the armed forces}} to a million soldiers by 1022. By that time, however, the military was consuming three-quarters of the tax revenues gathered by the state, compared to a mere 2 or 3 percent of state income that would be consumed by just providing the Liao with tribute. Due to these circumstances, intense political rivalries would later arise in the Song court <b>over</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> handle these issues.|$|E
5|$|After {{a decade}} out of politics, Willis was chosen without {{opposition}} as the Republican gubernatorial nominee in 1943. Infighting among the state's Democrats combined with Willis's popular proposal {{to eliminate the}} state income tax carried him to a narrow victory over J. Lyter Donaldson. Willis was opposed by Democratic majorities {{in both houses of}} the Kentucky General Assembly. The end of World War II in 1945 brought sizable budget surpluses to the state, and disagreements <b>over</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> spend the excess funds spilled over into special legislative sessions. Willis was not able to realize his campaign promise of eliminating the state income tax because the legislature expanded the budget far beyond what he proposed. Nevertheless, he was able to forge a record of modest accomplishments, including constructing five tuberculosis hospitals across the state and significantly increasing funding for education. Following his term as governor, he served on various state boards and commissions, but failed in his only attempt to return to elective officea 1952 campaign against Bert T. Combs to return to the Court of Appeals. Willis died on April 1, 1965, and is interred at Frankfort Cemetery in the capital city of Frankfort.|$|E
