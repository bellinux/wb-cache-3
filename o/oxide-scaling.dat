40|$|Both {{numerical}} analysis based on finite-element (FE) modeling and experimental evidence concerning the secondary <b>oxide-scale</b> failure at {{entry into the}} roll gap are presented and reviewed for {{a better understanding of}} events at the roll-workpiece interface, in turn, leading to better definition of the boundary conditions for process models. Attention is paid to the two limit modes leading to <b>oxide-scale</b> failure, which were observed earlier during tensile testing under rolling conditions. These are considered in relation to the temperature, the <b>oxide-scale</b> thickness, and other hot-rolling parameters. The mathematical model used for the analysis is composed of macro and micro parts, which allow for simulation of metal/scale flow, heat transfer, cracking of the oxide scale, as well as sliding along the oxide/metal interface and spallation of the scale from the metal surface. The different modes of <b>oxide-scale</b> failure were predicted, taking into account stress-directed diffusion, fracture and adhesion of the oxide scale, strain, strain rate, and temperature. Stalled hot-rolling tests under controlled conditions have been used to verify the types of <b>oxide-scale</b> failure and have shown good predictive capabilities of the model. The stock temperature and the <b>oxide-scale</b> thickness are important parameters, which, depending on other rolling conditions, may cause either through-thickness cracking of the scale at the entry or lead to entry of a nonfractured scale when the scale/metal interface is not strong enough to transmit the metal deformation...|$|R
40|$|The {{oxidation}} kinetics of high-purity nickel were studied between 500 and 1200 °C, in pure oxygen at atmospheric pressure, for aûerage <b>oxide-scale</b> thicknesses of 1, 5, 10, and 30 μm. In the oûerall temperature range studied, {{a decrease in}} the parabolic rate constant kp with increasing scale thickness was observed. Depending on temperature and <b>oxide-scale</b> thickness, growth kinetics can be interpreted as a mixture of parabolic- and cubic-growth kinetics. Possible correlations between growth kinetics and microstructures of the oxide scales were inûestigated. From this set of experimental data, oxidation-kinetics models were tested. In particular, the effect of grain-boundary diffusion on NiO-growth kinetics was discussed. The correlations between growth kinetics and oxide microstructures appear to be more complex than usually reported...|$|R
40|$|A ductile erosion model embodying the {{mechanisms}} of erosion involving cutting wear and repeated plastic deformation has been developed to predict erosion rates of boiler grade steels. The issue of erosion-oxidation interaction has also been addressed to further predict the mass loss resulted from this composite mechanism. A deterministic formalism for the kinetics of <b>oxide-scale</b> growth and a probabilistic approach to characterize the material loss are employed to describe simultaneous actions of high-temperature oxidation and mechanical erosion. The model predictions are in good agreement with the published data...|$|R
40|$|Oxidation {{characteristics}} of a microalloyed low carbon steel were investigated by a hot rolling mill combined with acceleration cooling system over the cooling rate range from 20 to 70 °C/s. The effects of cooling rate after hot rolling on microstructure and phase composition of oxide scale were examined. The {{results showed that the}} increase of the cooling rate has a significant influence on the decrease of the grain size and surface roughness of oxide scale. A higher cooling rate promotes the formation of retain wustite and primary magnetite precipitation while suppression of eutectoid α-iron precipitates. This provides the possibility to enhance potential contribution of magnetite precipitates with preferable ductility, and hence fabricates a desired <b>oxide-scale</b> structure under continuous post cooling conditions considering a suitable cooling rate...|$|R
40|$|The {{oxidation}} {{behavior of}} a Ferritic 10 %Cr steel in Ar-H 2 O mixtures was investigated at temperatures between 550 and 650 degrees C. The studies aimed at elucidating the effect of water-vapor content {{as well as the}} gas flow rate on the mechanisms of <b>oxide-scale</b> formation. It was found that, the oxide types and morphologies depend on time and exposure conditions. An important observation is that H- 2 produced by the reaction of water vapor with the steel can {{play a significant role in}} the oxidation process. First, it affects the possibility to form an external hematite layer and if the latter is not present, it tends to decrease the growth rate of the magnetite-base oxide scale. The extend by which the H- 2 affects the oxidation behavior depends on the gas-flow conditions, the water-vapor content and the exposure time...|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous {{deposition}} of Cr-Al and Cr-Si as diffusion coatings for ferritic steel (Fe- 12 Cr) substrate {{have been carried}} out using the pack cementation method. A computer-assisted thermodynamic study of the equilibrium vapor pressures of volatile halide species formed by the pack components was performed. The simultaneous co{{deposition of}} Cr with Al is thermodynamically possible for chloride-activated packs when the activity of Al is about three orders of magnitude lower than the chromium activity; for Si-Cr codeposition, the activity of Si must be approximately one order of magnitude lower than that for Cr. The experimental tests of the theory agree reasonably with the predictions, and the resulting coatings promise an improvement in resistance to oxidation and corrosion. The simultaneous addition of Ti as an active element to improve <b>oxide-scale</b> adhesion is demonstrated for a Ti-doped Cr-Al coating...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of internal stresses in oxide scales growing on polycrystalline Fe(3) Al alloy in atmospheric air at 700 degrees C was determined using in situ energy-dispersive synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Ex situ texture {{analyses were performed}} after 5 h of oxidation at 700 degrees C. Under these conditions, the <b>oxide-scale</b> thickness, as determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, lies between 80 and 100 nm. The main phase present in the oxide scales is alpha-Al(2) O(3), with minor quantities of metastable theta-Al(2) O(3) detected in the first minutes of oxidation, as well as alpha-Fe(2) O(3). alpha-Al(2) O(3) grows with a weak (0001) fiber texture in the normal direction. During {{the initial stages of}} oxidation the scale develops, increasing levels of compressive stresses which later evolve to a steady state condition situated around - 300 MPa.

40|$|The {{vaporization}} of Cr(VI) {{species and}} the greater electrical resistance caused by a growing oxide scale are probably the two most detrimental degradation mechanisms {{associated with the use}} of Cr 2 O 3 -forming alloys as the interconnect material in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC). High electrical efficiency, clean emissions and the possibility to utilize several types of fuels, such as hydrogen, alcohols and hydrocarbons are some of the great advantages of SOFC technology. However, the limited lifetime and high production costs of a SOFC have limited the commercialization of this technology. Therefore, improving the component materials and reducing production costs is of great importance. This thesis has examined both mechanisms; Cr vaporization and oxide scale growth. The possibility to pre-coat large amounts of steel and deform the material to allow for gas distribution as an alternative method for reducing production costs was also investigated. To achieve these objectives, nano coatings of Co and Ce were applied to Cr 2 O 3 -forming ferritic stainless steels to decrease Cr vaporization and improve the oxidation resistance of the interconnect material. All exposures were carried out in a simulated cathode-side environment consisting of air- 3 % H 2 O. Cr vaporization was measured using a denuder technique and <b>oxide-scale</b> growth was studied mainly gravimetrically. For chemical, structural and microstructural analysis, SEM/EDX, FIB and XRD techniques were used. The results presented in this thesis show that high quality coatings that mitigate Cr vaporization are necessary, even if the SOFC operating temperature is decreased to temperatures as low as 650 ºC. By coating a ferritic stainless steel with 600 nm Co, the Cr vaporization rate can be decreased by almost 90 %, and by adding an extra 10 nm layer of Ce, the high temperature corrosion resistance of the interconnect material can be significantly improved, and electrical <b>oxide-scale</b> resistance can be reduced. When the pre-coated steel was mechanically deformed to allow for gas distribution, large cracks formed in the coating. However, upon exposure, the cracks healed and formed a continuous surface oxide rich in Co and Mn. As an effect of this rapid healing, no increase in Cr vaporization was detected for the pre-coated material...|$|R
40|$|Rail car {{components}} {{recovered from}} the train involved in the July 18, 2001, Howard Street Tunnel, Baltimore, Maryland train derailment and fire were used to estimate the fire duration and temperatures achieved by the components. Steel samples including sections of the box car panels and a bolt from an air brake assembly were analyzed using standard metallurgical methods to determine oxide layer thickness {{and the amount of}} metal lost {{as a result of the}} elevated temperature exposure. Aluminum alloy air brake valve assemblies, which melted as a consequence of the fire, were analyzed using a heat transfer model. Analyses of the recovered components suggest the surface temperature of the steel reached 700 to 850 °C [1, 292 to 1, 562 °F] assuming an exposure time of 4 hours at the elevated temperatures. Independent assessment of fire duration could not be obtained from the steel components because the oxide scale thickness and metal loss are dependent on both time and temperature. Several limitations to the assessment of temperature were noted including the effects of <b>oxide-scale</b> spalling and post-fire atmospheric exposure for a period of more than 1 year. Thermal analysis of the aluminum air brake valve body located approximately 10 m [33 ft] fro...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{substrate}} composition on the oxidation {{behavior of the}} industrial NiPtAl coating RT 22 TM was investigated by studying the isothermal and cyclic-oxidation behavior of this coating deposited on three different Ni-base superalloys (CMSX- 4 TM, SCB TM and IN 792 TM). Isothermal tests were performed at 900, 1050 and 1150 °C for 100 h. Cyclic oxidation was studied at 900 °C with a holding time of 300 h for up to 52 cycles (i. e, 15, 600 h at 900 °C). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), microstructural and analytical investigations using scanning-electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission-electron microscopy (TEM), both equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were performed to characterize the oxidation behavior of the systems studied. An effect of the superalloy substrate was observed and related to the initial chemical composition of the coating surface which depends on the superalloy and the associated heat treatments. The effect of the substrate’s alloying elements is discussed. Particularly the influence of Ti and Ta that formed rutile-type oxides inducing <b>oxide-scale</b> cracking and spallation. The excellent resistance to cyclic oxidation of the coating systems studied at 900 °C was also demonstrated from very long duration tests of 15, 600 h...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlthough the {{road-map}} of the oxy-fuel process {{seems to}} be very advanced, there are still plenty of open questions. One of the significant ones is the corrosive behaviour of the heat exchanger surfaces. The Institute of Combustion and Power Plant Technology, University of Stuttgart, performs research on the fireside corrosion under oxy-fuel and conventional combustion conditions for the current and supercritical power plants considering the influence of combustion modus, gas atmosphere and fly ash deposits on the waterwall and superheater surfaces. Since the oxy-fuel-combustion atmosphere is composed of recirculated flue gases and pure oxygen, significantly higher concentrations of CO 2, SO 2 and H 2 O are present compared to the conventional combustion of coal with air as an oxidizer. In the here presented study the influence of an oxy-fuel combustion of a hard-coal on the surface of selected superheater materials is discussed and compared to the results obtained for lignite. Especially the interactions between the flue gas atmosphere, ash deposits and heat exchanger materials are studied in detail. The investigation encompassed in this paper has been focused on impacts of <b>oxide-scale</b> growth, carbon enrichment of the materials and sulphur-induced corrosion. Increased sulphur-induced corrosion has been observed in samples exposed to the oxy-combustion atmosphere. The noticed higher depth of corrosive attack of the oxy-fuel samples might be explained by a higher partial pressure of SO 2 which is characteristic for oxy-fuel process. Moreover in certain cases the sulphur might be released by the deposits. Beside that, the oxy-fuel samples were exposed to much higher partial pressures of carbon dioxide comparing to the air-case leading apparently to rapid and massive internal carbon enrichment in the oxide scale. Moreover dependence between the chromium content and oxidation ability of the austenitic materials surfaces was noticed under oxy-fuel conditions...|$|R
40|$|When high Al {{containing}} Fe alloys such as TRIP steels {{are exposed}} to atmospheres that contain N 2 during re-heating, sub-surface nitrides form and these can be detrimental to mechanical properties. Nitride precipitation can be controlled by minimizing the access of the gaseous atmosphere to the metal surface, which {{can be achieved by}} a rapid growth of a continuous and adherent surface scale. This investigation utilizes a Au-image furnace attached to a confocal scanning microscope to simulate the annealing temperature vs time while Fe-Al alloys (with Al contents varying from 1 to 8 wt pct) {{are exposed to}} a O 2 -N 2 atm with 10 − 6 atm O 2. The heating times of 1, 10, and 100 minutes to the isothermal temperature of 1558 K (1285 °C) were used. It was found that fewer sub-surface nitride precipitates formed when the heating time was lowered and when Al content in the samples was increased. In the 8 wt pct samples, no internal nitride precipitates were present regardless of heating time. In the 3 and 5 wt pct samples, internal nitride precipitates were nearly more or less absent at heating times less than 10 minutes. The decrease in internal precipitates was governed by the evolving structure of the external <b>oxide-scale.</b> At low heating rates and/or low Al contents, significant Fe-oxide patches formed and these appeared to allow for ingress of gaseous N 2. For the slow heating rates, ingress could have happened during the longer time spent in lower temperatures where non-protective alumina was present. As Al content in the alloy was increased, the external scale was Al 2 O 3 and/or FeAl 2 O 4 and more continuous and consequently hindered the N 2 from accessing the metal surface. Increasing the Al content in the alloy had the effect of promoting the outward diffusion of Al in the alloy and thereby assisting the formation of the continuous external layer of Al 2 O 3 and/or FeAl 2 O 4...|$|R
40|$|Materials for {{high-pressure}} turbine blades {{must be able}} to operate in the high-temperature gases (above 1000 °C) emerging from the combustion chamber. Accordingly, the development of nickel-based superalloys has been constantly motivated by the need to have improved engine efficiency, reliability and service lifetime under the harsh conditions imposed by the turbine environment. However, the melting point of nickel (1455 °C) provides a natural ceiling for the temperature capability of nickel-based superalloys. Thus, surface-engineered turbine components with modified diffusion coatings and overlay coatings are used. Theses coatings are capable of forming a compact and adherent oxide scale, which greatly impedes the further transport of reactants between the high-temperature gases and the underlying metal and thus reducing attack by the atmosphere. Typically, these coatings contain beta-NiAl as a principal constituent phase in order to have sufficient aluminum content to form an Al 2 O 3 scale at elevated temperatures. The drawbacks to the currently-used beta-based coatings, such as phase instabilities, associated stresses induced by such phase instabilities, and extensive coating/substrate interdiffusion, are major motivations in this study to seek next-generation coatings.;The high-temperature oxidation resistance of novel Pt+Hf-modified gamma-Ni+gamma 2 ̆ 7 -Ni 3 Al-based alloys and coatings were investigated in this study. Both early-stage and 4 -days isothermal oxidation behavior of single-phase gamma-Ni and gamma 2 ̆ 7 -Ni 3 Al alloys were assessed by examining the weight changes, <b>oxide-scale</b> structures, and elemental concentration profiles through the scales and subsurface alloy regions. It was found that Pt promotes Al 2 O 3 formation by suppressing the NiO growth on both gamma-Ni and gamma 2 ̆ 7 -Ni 3 Al single-phase alloys. This effect increases with increasing Pt content. Moreover, Pt exhibits this effect even at lower temperatures (∼ 970 °C) in the very early stage of oxidation. It was also inferred that Pt enhances the diffusive flux of aluminum from the substrate to the scale/alloy interface. Relatively low levels of hafnium addition to Pt-free gamma 2 ̆ 7 -Ni 3 Al increased the extent of external NiO formation due to non-protective HfO 2 formation. Accordingly, this effect intensified with increasing Hf content from 0. 2 to 0. 5 at. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{dislocation}} density-based {{constitutive model}} has been developed and implemented into a crystal plasticity quasi-static finite element framework. This approach captures the statistical evolution of dislocation structures and grain fragmentation at the bonding interface when sufficient boundary conditions pertaining to the Ultrasonic Consolidation (UC) process are prescribed. The hardening is incorporated using statistically stored and geometrically necessary dislocation densities (SSDs and GNDs), which are dislocation analogs of isotropic and kinematic hardening, respectively. Since the macroscopic global boundary conditions during UC involves cyclic sinosuidal simple shear loading along with constant normal pressure, the cross slip mechanism has {{been included in the}} evolution equation for SSDs. The inclusion of cross slip promotes slip irreversibility, dislocation storage, and hence, cyclic hardening during the UC. The GND considers strain-gradient and thus renders the model size-dependent. The model is calibrated using experimental data from published refereed literature for simple shear deformation of single crystalline pure aluminum alloy and uniaxial tension of polycrystalline Aluminum 3003 -H 18 alloy. The model also incorporates various local and global effects such as (1) friction, (2) thermal softening, (3) acoustic softening, (4) surface texture of the sonotrode and initial mating surfaces, and (6) presence of <b>oxide-scale</b> at the mating surfaces, which further contribute significantly specifically to the grain substructure evolution at the interface and to the anisotropic bulk deformation away from the interface during UC in general. The model results have been predicted for Al- 3003 alloy undergoing UC. A good agreement between the experimental and simulated results has been observed for the evolution of linear weld density and anisotropic global strengths macroscopically. Similarly, microscopic observations such as embrittlement due to grain substructure evolution at the UC interface have been also demonstrated by the simulation. In conclusion, the model was able to predict the effects of macroscopic global boundary conditions on bond quality. It has been found that the normal pressure enhances good bonding characteristics at the interface, though beyond a certain magnitude enhances dynamic failure. Similarly, lower oscillation amplitudes result in a lower rate of gap closure, whereas higher oscillation amplitude results in an enhanced rate of gap relaxation at the interface. Henceforth, good bonding characteristics between the constituent foils are found at an optimum oscillation amplitude. A similar analogy is also true for weld speed where the longitudinal locations behind the sonotrode rip open when higher weld speeds are implemented in the UC machine, leading to lower linear weld density and poor bonding characteristics...|$|R
