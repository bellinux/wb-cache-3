25|$|In Manila in {{the early}} hours of January 30, 1911, people were awakened out of their sleep by what they at first took for loud thunder. The {{illusion}} was heightened when great streaks of lightning were seen to illumine the southern sky. Those who investigated further, however, soon learned the truth. A huge, fan-shaped cloud <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> like black smoke rose to a great height. It was crossed and crisscrossed with a brilliant electrical display, which the people of Manila at first took for lightning. This cloud finally shot up in the air, spread, then dissipated, and this marked the culmination of the eruption, at about 2:30 a. m.|$|E
25|$|United Russia's {{predecessor}} was the Unity bloc, {{which was}} created {{three months before the}} December 1999 Duma elections to counter the advance of the Fatherland – All Russia (OVR) party led by Yuri Luzhkov. The creation of the party was heavily supported by Kremlin insiders, who were wary <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> like a certain OVR victory. They did not expect Unity to have much chance of success, since President Boris Yeltsin was very unpopular and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's ratings were still minuscule. The new party attempted to mimic OVR's formula of success, placing an emphasis on competence and pragmatism. Charismatic Minister of Emergency Situations Sergei Shoigu was appointed as the party leader.|$|E

This aroused the suspicions of both the drain inspector and his supervisor. Cattran discovered some scraps of flesh and four bones in a pipe leading from the drain which linked to the top flat of the house. To both Cattran and Wheeler, the bones {{looked as if they}} originated from a human hand. Both men immediately called the police who, upon closer inspection, discovered further small bones and scraps <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> to the naked eye like either human or animal flesh in the same pipe leading from the drain. These remains were taken to the mortuary at Hornsey, where pathologist Professor David Bowen advised police that the remains were indeed human, and that one particular piece of flesh he concluded had been from a human neck bore a ligature mark.|$|E

500|$|Stephen of Blois, a Crusade leader, was in Alexandretta when {{he learned}} of the {{situation}} in Antioch. It seemed like their situation was hopeless so he left the Middle East, warning Alexios and his army {{on his way back to}} France. Because <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> like a massive betrayal, the leaders at Antioch, most notably Bohemond, argued that Alexios had deserted the Crusade and thus invalidated all of their oaths to him. While Bohemond asserted his claim to Antioch, not everyone agreed (most notably Raymond of Toulouse), so the crusade was delayed for the rest of the year while the nobles argued amongst themselves. When discussing this period, a common historiographical viewpoint advanced by some scholars is that the Franks of northern France, the Provençals of southern France, and the Normans of southern Italy considered themselves separate [...] "nations", creating turmoil as each tried to increase its individual status. Others argue that while this may have had something to do with the disputes, personal ambition among the Crusader leaders might just be as easily blamed.|$|E
