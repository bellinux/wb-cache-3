40|$|<b>Olive</b> <b>tree</b> wood is an {{agricultural}} residue largely available in Portugal. It {{is estimated that}} the amount of material annually produced from <b>olive</b> <b>trees</b> pruning, can be up to 250 000 tonnes. This wood resulting from pruning is a material rich in cellulose and hemicelluloses which can be recovered for the production of 2 nd generation ethanol through its use as feedstock. Pretreatment is a crucial step in bioconversion of lignocellulosics to bioethanol, in order to improve the carbohydrates accessibility to enzymatic attack.

40|$|The genetic {{diversity}} of “Gama” and “Bico de Corvo”, local cultivars of <b>olive</b> <b>tree</b> (Olea europaea) from seven traditional orchards of Ficalho (Alentejo region, Portugal), was studied {{to characterize the}} local diversity and assess the level of on farm diversity. Two different analytical systems were used: endocarp morphological characteristics and genetic analysis by microsatellite markers (Simple Sequence Repeats or SSR). The seven screened loci were polymorphic and allowed the identification of 23 distinct SSR profiles within the 27 trees analyzed. A total of 52 different alleles were scored, {{with an average of}} 7. 43 alleles/SSR locus, and considerable {{genetic diversity}} was found. Neighbor-Joining algorithm cluster analysis and principal co-ordinate analysis (PCoA) allowed for the identification of the genetic relationships between several accessions. The 27 Olea accessions were clearly separated into three different groups. SSR analysis was more precise than endocarp characterization in the classification of genetic diversity among the <b>olive</b> <b>tree</b> cultivars. The <b>study</b> shows reasonable <b>olive</b> <b>tree</b> diversity in Ficalho, indicating that these traditional orchards are important reservoirs of old minor cultivars and incubators of new genotypes...|$|R
