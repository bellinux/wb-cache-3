5|$|The first {{decay of}} atoms of {{oganesson}} {{was observed in}} 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia, by a joint team of Russian and American scientists. Headed by Russian nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian, the team included American scientists of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, California. On 9 October 2006, the researchers announced that they had indirectly detected {{a total of three}} (possibly four) nuclei of oganesson-294 (one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> 2002 and two more in 2005) produced via collisions of californium-249 atoms and calcium-48 ions.|$|E
5|$|Often, all the mayflies in a {{population}} mature at once (a hatch), and for a day <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> the spring or autumn, mayflies are everywhere, dancing around each other in large groups, or resting on every available surface. In many species the emergence is synchronised with dawn or dusk, and light intensity {{seems to be an}} important cue for emergence, but other factors may also be involved. Baetis intercalaris, for example, usually emerges just after sunset in July and August, but in one year, a large hatch was observed at midday in June. The soft-bodied subimagos are very attractive to predators. Synchronous emergence is probably an adaptive strategy that reduces the individual's risk of being eaten. The lifespan of an adult mayfly is very short, varying with the species. The primary function of the adult is reproduction; adults do not feed, and have only vestigial (unusable) mouthparts, while their digestive systems are filled with air. Dolania americana has the shortest lifespan of any mayfly: the adult females of the species live for less than five minutes.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes the leads, {{which are}} small {{diameter}} wires, from the pacemaker to the implantation {{site in the}} heart muscle {{will need to be}} removed. The most common reason for lead removal is infection, however over time leads can degrade due to a number of reasons such as lead flexing. Changes to programming of the pacemaker may overcome lead degradation to some extent. However a patient who has several pacemaker replacements over a decade <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> which the leads were reused may require a lead replacement surgery.|$|E
25|$|Srivijaya, a {{maritime}} empire centered at Palembang on {{the island}} of Sumatra in Indonesia, adopted Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna Buddhism under a line of rulers named the Sailendras.

Yijing also testified to the importance of Buddhism as early as the year 671 and advised future Chinese pilgrims to spend a year <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> Palembang.

The last two were twin-engine aircraft of size, passenger capacity, and high wing loading comparable to the DC-4 and the first Constellations.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{unheard of}} {{for a student}} to go even a year <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> a {{residency}} and switching to a new program. However, even in relatively noncompetitive residencies, politics can come into play when considering a resident's transfer. A notable case has been that of Dr. Eugene Gu who has been subpoenaed by two separate Tennessee Congresswomen, Marsha Blackburn and Diane Black, while pursuing a general surgery residency at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. Dr. Gu has attempted {{for over a year}} to transfer into a general surgery program in California or on the West Coast but so far remains in Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|Dodd {{stayed with}} his aunt, Mrs. Susan Dodd, in Little Rock. Except for some Union soldiers, {{there were very}} few teenage boys in the city, and Dodd was popular with the city's younger girls. He even became popular with some of the younger {{servicemen}} at the arsenal, especially because he usually was accompanied by a local girl <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> <b>In</b> addition to his father's letters, he also delivered letters to several people he knew. Dodd attended some holiday dances with at least two girls, Mary Swindle and Minerva Cogburn. He also spent some time with 16-year-old Mary Dodge at her home, where Union officers were quartered. Mary supported the Southern cause; her father, R. L. Dodge, was a Vermont native on friendly terms with the Northern troops.|$|E

He might have had a match <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> <b>in</b> fact, as Zimbabwe suffered from injuries, and had he been available he might have played in the final Test against the West Indies instead of Hamilton Masakadza, who hit a century on debut.|$|E

San Francisco included the husband-and-wife team of Fred LaCosse and Terry Lowry (other ABC owned-and-operated stations produced their own A.M. programs in the 1980s; for example, A.M. Chicago at WLS-TV evolved into The Oprah Winfrey Show, and Live with Kelly and Ryan evolved from a similar A.M. program on WABC). For a week <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> the summer of 1988, A.M.

25|$|Because the pseudonymous authors write from {{perspectives}} {{which are}} not Kierkegaard's own, some of the philosophy {{mentioned in this article}} may or may not necessarily reflect Kierkegaard's own beliefs. Just as other philosophers bring up viewpoints in their essays to discuss and criticize them, Kierkegaard assigns pseudonyms to explore a particular viewpoint in-depth, which may take up a whole book <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> some instances, and Kierkegaard, or another pseudonym, critiques that position. For example, the author, Johannes Climacus is not a Christian and he argues from a non-Christian viewpoint. Anti-Climacus, as mentioned earlier, is a Christian to a high degree and he argues from a devout Christian viewpoint. Kierkegaard places his beliefs in-between these two authors.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, {{the farm}} equipment, {{construction}} equipment, and heavy electrical industries {{were not as}} profitable for Allis-Chalmers {{as they had been}} in the 1930s through 1950s. Reasonable prosperity continued in the farm equipment line, but the economics of all the industries shifted toward greater uncertainty and brittler success for firms that didn't become number one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> a field. Allis-Chalmers was often number three or four, as Deere and International Harvester led in farm machinery, Caterpillar and Case led in construction, and Westinghouse and General Electric led in heavy electric markets. In the late 1960s, a trend of conglomeration flared, as mega-conglomerates like Ling-Temco-Vought, Gulf+Western, and White Consolidated Industries went on buying sprees. Several takeover attempts by those firms were made on Allis-Chalmers. It was during the same era and business climate that Tenneco acquired Case.|$|E
25|$|After the Battle of Kosovo, Prince Lazar was interred in the Church of the Ascension in Priština, {{the capital}} of Vuk Branković's domain. After a year <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> <b>in</b> 1390 or 1391, Lazar's relics were {{transferred}} to the Ravanica Monastery, which the prince had built and intended as his burial place. The translation was organized by the Serbian Church and Lazar's family. The ceremonial interment of the relics in Ravanica was attended by the highest clergy of the Serbian Church, including Patriarch Danilo III. It is most likely at this time and place that Lazar was canonized, though no account of his canonization was written. He was included among the Christian martyrs, with his feast day being celebrated on 15June. According to writings by Patriarch Danilo and other contemporary authors, Prince Lazar was captured and beheaded by the Turks. His death could thus be likened to that of early Christian martyrs who were slain by pagans.|$|E
