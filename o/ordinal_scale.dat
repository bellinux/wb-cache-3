The film takes place after the anime series' second season, Sword Art Online II. It was then revealed at the Dengeki Bunko Haru no Saiten 2016 event on March 13, 2016 that the film is titled Sword Art Online The Movie: <b>Ordinal</b> <b>Scale.</b> The voice cast from the anime series returned to reprise their roles in the film.|$|E

25|$|Sword Art Online: Memory Defrag, {{launched}} by Bandai Namco Entertainment, was released outside of Japan on January 24, 2017. This RPG {{is available on}} iOS and Android devices. Featuring content from the anime series, <b>Ordinal</b> <b>Scale,</b> and some original shorts written for event characters, players are allowed to play solo and progress through the story, or join up with others online to farm special items, equipment, and materials. Common events include ranked challenges against other players, floor clearing, character introductions and seasonal events. Players have the choice of spending real money to speed-up their progress.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} {{recognize}} incorrect pitch (musical) is most often tested by using the Distorted Tunes Test (DTT). The DTT was originally developed in the 1940s and was used in large studies in the British population. The DTT measures musical pitch recognition ability on an <b>ordinal</b> <b>scale,</b> scored {{as the number of}} correctly classified tunes. More specifically the DTT is used to evaluate subjects on how well they judge whether simple popular melodies contain notes with incorrect pitch. Researchers have used this method to investigate genetic correlates of musical pitch recognition in both monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Drayna, Manichaikul, Lange, Snieder and Spector (2001) determined that the variation in musical pitch recognition is primarily due to highly heritable differences in auditory functions not tested by conventional audiologic methods. Therefore, the DTT method may provide a benefit to advancing research studies similar to this one.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore how weak scales, defined in the {{representational}} theory of measurement as nominal <b>scales</b> or <b>ordinal</b> <b>scales,</b> can be calibrated. Prior to this exploration, the definition of the calibration process is analysed then extended to a more general form compatible with weak scales. The opportunity to apply such process to nominal <b>scales</b> and <b>ordinal</b> <b>scales</b> is presented. Then the calibration of metrical scales is proposed. Finally an application to the calibration of a colour space is presented...|$|R
30|$|As {{described}} above, we use {{job satisfaction}} measured on an 11 -point satisfaction scale {{as a proxy}} for individual on-the-job utility. Since we cannot determine exact differences in utility between points on this scale, satisfaction is measured with <b>ordinal</b> <b>scaling.</b> Ordinary least squares regression models assume metric scaling of the dependent variable. Hence the use of a regression model which accounts for the <b>ordinal</b> <b>scaling</b> of satisfaction measures is required. Widespread models meeting this demand are latent variable models such as the ordered-logit or ordered-probit model (Long 1997; McKelvey and Zavoina 1975 and recently Greene and Hensher 2010).|$|R

2500|$|Spatial {{memory recall}} is built upon a {{hierarchical}} structure. That {{is to say}} that people remember the general layout of a particular space and then [...] "cue target locations" [...] located within that spatial set. This paradigm includes an <b>ordinal</b> <b>scale</b> of features that an individual must attend to in order to inform his or her cognitive map. Recollection of spatial details is a top-down procedure that requires an individual to recall the superordinate features of a cognitive map, followed by the ordinate and subordinate features. Thus, two spatial features are prominent in navigating a path: general layout and landmark orienting (Kahana et al., 2006).|$|E

The second review came from Cine Premier's Julio Vélez who scored it a 4.5/5 and stated: [...] "The second act falls a little in action by focusing more on defining the motives of the antagonists, but everything recovers in an exciting and prolonged climax".

40|$|This article studies {{aggregation}} {{operators in}} <b>ordinal</b> <b>scales</b> for their application to clustering (more specifically, to microaggregation for statistical disclosure risk). In particular, we consider these operators {{in the process}} of prototype construction. This study analyzes main aggregation operators for <b>ordinal</b> <b>scales</b> [plurality rule, medians, Sugeno integrals (SI), and ordinal weighted means (OWM), among others] and shows the difficulties for their application in this particular setting. Then, we propose two approaches to solve the drawbacks and we study their properties. Special emphasis is given to the study of monotonicity because the operator is proven nonsatisfactory for this property. Exhaustive empirical work shows that in most practical situations, this cannot be considered a problem. 2003 Wiley Periodicals, In...|$|R

In particular, this identification allows us to justify the continuity property for certain order invariant functions in a natural way...|$|R

40|$|Arguments {{for the use}} of {{sequential}} <b>ordinal</b> <b>scales</b> in {{the observation}} of infants and young children are based on the tendency of traditional psychometric assessment to distract investigators from discerning structural. and hierarchiCal aspects. of development. Norm-referenced testing focuses on interindividual comparisons rather than developmental patterns. Mental age and IQ scores are often considered to be fixed quantities, and interpreted inappropriately in educational practice. Sequential <b>ordinal</b> <b>scales,</b> as originally suggested by Piaget, invite investigation of structural details. Their advantages are (1) The hypothetical sequential order permits direct testing of hypotheses of the sequential organization of development, (2) They allow for the examination of relationships between-developmental patterns and environmental circumstances, (3) They provide means to test Piaget's hypothesis of six sensorimotor. stages, (4) They disentangle development. from the age variable,&apos...|$|R
40|$|Background: Historically, most acute stroke {{clinical}} trials were neutral statistically, with trials typically dichotomising <b>ordinal</b> <b>scales,</b> {{such as the}} modified Rankin Scale. Studies published before 2007 have shown that preserving the ordinal nature of these scales increased statistical power. A systematic review of trials published since 2007 was conducted to re-evaluate statistical methods used and to assess whether practice has changed. Methods: A search of electronic databases identified RCTs published between Jan 2007 and July 2014 in acute ischaemic stroke using an <b>ordinal</b> dependency <b>scale</b> as the primary outcome. Findings: Forty-two RCTs were identified. The majority used a dichotomous analysis (25, 59. 5...|$|R

40|$|The {{measurement}} of several concepts used in social sciences generates an ordinal variable, which {{is characterized by}} rawness of the output values and presents some much debated problems in data analysis. In fact, the need for effective analysis is easily satisfied with parametric models that deal with quantitative variables. However, the peculiarities of the <b>ordinal</b> <b>scales,</b> and the crude values produced by them, limit the use of parametric models, which has generated conflicting favourable and unfavourable views of the parametric approach. The main distinctive features of <b>ordinal</b> <b>scales,</b> {{some of which are}} critical points and nodal issues, are illustrated here along with the construction processes. Among the traditional procedures, the most common <b>ordinal</b> <b>scales</b> are described, including the Likert, semantic differential, feeling thermometers, and the Stapel scale. A relative new method, based on fuzzy sets, can be used to handle and generate ordinal variables. Therefore, the structure of a fuzzy inference system is exemplified in synthetic terms to show the treatment of ordinal variables to obtain one or more response variables. The nature of ordinal variables influences the interpretation and selection of many strategies used for their analysis. Four approaches are illustrated (nonparametric, parametric, latent variables, and fuzzy inference system), highlighting their potential and drawbacks. The modelling of an ordinal dependent variable (loglinear models, ordinary parametric models or logit and probit ordinal models, latent class models and hybrid models) is affected by the various approaches...|$|R
