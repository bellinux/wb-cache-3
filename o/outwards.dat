5|$|Rectrices {{are always}} {{numbered}} from the centermost pair <b>outwards</b> in both directions.|$|E
5|$|Appendages: Two {{pairs of}} wings {{normally}} present. The forewings are modified into short smooth, veinless tegmina. Hindwings are membranous and semicircular with veins radiating <b>outwards.</b>|$|E
5|$|Temple 20 (Structure 5D-20) {{is located}} upon the {{northwest}} corner of the basal platform and looks <b>outwards</b> to the north. It is estimated to date to approximately AD 550.|$|E
5|$|Temple 21 (Structure 5D-21) forms a {{pair with}} Temple 20; {{it is located}} upon the {{northeast}} corner of the basal platform and also looks <b>outwards</b> to the north; it is thought to date to around AD 550.|$|E
5|$|A polytree is a {{directed}} graph formed by orienting {{the edges of}} a free tree. Every polytree is a DAG. In particular, {{this is true of}} the arborescences formed by directing all edges <b>outwards</b> from the roots of a tree.|$|E
5|$|London {{had been}} a Roman {{settlement}} for four centuries and had become progressively more crowded inside its defensive city wall. It had also pushed <b>outwards</b> beyond the wall into squalid extramural slums such as Shoreditch, Holborn, and Southwark, and had reached far enough to include the independent City of Westminster.|$|E
5|$|Luongo {{plays in}} the {{butterfly}} style of goaltending, dropping to his knees with his skates pointing <b>outwards</b> and his pads meeting in the middle in order to cover the bottom portion of the net. Due to the style of play, groin injuries are common for butterfly goalies. Luongo suffered one during the 2008–09 season and missed 24 games.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{additions}} to the DRR occurred in March 1956 when new covered shelters were built on each end of Frontierland Station's depot building. The shelters were added after the DRR's track on {{the western edge of}} its route, and the depot building standing next to it, were moved <b>outwards.</b>|$|E
5|$|The long, rectilinear, two-storey building, had {{a double}} {{cantilevered}} frame supported {{on a single}} row of concrete columns. These columns tilted <b>outwards</b> from a vertical position. Floor to ceiling glazing on the second storey opened out onto a balcony running {{the length of the}} building. It included technical innovations from America including acoustic ceiling tiles, underfloor electricity ducts and fluorescent lighting.|$|E
5|$|The planets {{scattered}} {{the majority}} of the small icy bodies inwards, while themselves moving <b>outwards.</b> These planetesimals then scattered off the next planet they encountered in a similar manner, moving the planets' orbits <b>outwards</b> while they moved inwards. This process continued until the planetesimals interacted with Jupiter, whose immense gravity sent them into highly elliptical orbits or even ejected them outright from the Solar System. This caused Jupiter to move slightly inward. Those objects scattered by Jupiter into highly elliptical orbits formed the Oort cloud; those objects scattered to a lesser degree by the migrating Neptune formed the current Kuiper belt and scattered disc. This scenario explains the Kuiper belt's and scattered disc's present low mass. Some of the scattered objects, including Pluto, became gravitationally tied to Neptune's orbit, forcing them into mean-motion resonances. Eventually, friction within the planetesimal disc made the orbits of Uranus and Neptune circular again.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Thayer Mahan's book The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660–1783, {{published}} in 1890, was very influential in justifying the naval {{program to the}} civilian government and to the general public. With {{the closing of the}} frontier, some Americans began to look <b>outwards,</b> to the Caribbean, to Hawaii and the Pacific, and with the doctrine of Manifest Destiny as philosophical justification, many saw the Navy as an essential part of realizing that doctrine beyond the limits of the American continent.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} an apotropaic, mirrors {{have been used to}} ward off vampires when placed, facing <b>outwards,</b> on a door (in some cultures, vampires do not have a reflection and sometimes do not cast a shadow, perhaps as a manifestation of the vampire's lack of a soul). This attribute is not universal (the Greek vrykolakas/tympanios was capable of both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram Stoker in Dracula and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers.|$|E
5|$|As Queen Mary 2 is {{too large}} to dock in many ports, {{passengers}} are ferried {{to and from the}} ship in tenders, which can be used as lifeboats in an emergency. These are stored while at sea in davits alongside the lifeboats. To transport passengers to shore the tenders pull up to one of four loading stations, each of which has a large hull door that hydraulically opens <b>outwards</b> to form a boarding platform, complete with railings and decking.|$|E
5|$|Besides these unique characteristics, Sampson {{pointed out}} {{additional}} differences with two very closely related forms. The frill spikes of Achelousaurus are more <b>outwards</b> oriented than the spikes of Einiosaurus, which are medially curved; the spikes of Achelousaurus are nevertheless less {{directed to the}} outside than the comparable spikes of Pachyrhinosaurus. Achelousaurus also differs from Pachyrhinosaurus in its smaller nasal boss that does not reach the frontal bones at its rear. Apart from the skull, no features of the skeleton are known that distinguish Achelousaurus from {{other members of the}} Centrosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to earlier}} works of this type, Christ's body is more {{physically}} corporeal, {{depicted as a}} real object, and his anatomy more closely rendered. His hands and feet seem to extend beyond the pictorial space, which is delineated by the flat, coloured borders of the cross, in turn made up of at least six boards. Both Christ's body and his semi-circular nimbus are placed at angles which rise <b>outwards</b> and above {{the level of the}} cross.|$|E
5|$|Having assumed this {{formation}} {{upon the}} giving of a prearranged signal, the Allied ships moved suddenly <b>outwards</b> from this position {{at a second}} signal, rowing into the Persian ships and catching them off guard. Their superior seamanship negated, the Persians came off worst from the encounter with 30 of their ships captured or sunk. During the battle a Greek ship, captained by Antidorus of Lemnos, defected to the Allies. Nightfall then ended the battle, with the Allies having fared better than they possibly expected to.|$|E
5|$|Highway27 was {{designated}} as a two lane road travelling north from Highway2 (Lake Shore Boulevard) towards Barrie. As Toronto grew <b>outwards</b> following the annexation of various municipalities, the Ontario Department of Highways (DHO) began planning for a bypass of the city, aptly named the Toronto Bypass. A significant portion of this bypass {{was designed to be}} incorporated into the Transprovincial Highway, now Highway401. The remainder was designed to follow the existing right-of-way of Highway27 between the QEW and Richview Sideroad (now Eglinton Avenue).|$|E
5|$|Other sharks feed on squid or fish, {{which they}} swallow whole. The viper dogfish has teeth it can point <b>outwards</b> to strike and capture prey that it then {{swallows}} intact. The great white {{and other large}} predators either swallow small prey whole or take huge bites out of large animals. Thresher sharks use their long tails to stun shoaling fishes, and sawsharks either stir prey from the seabed or slash at swimming prey with their tooth-studded rostra.|$|E
5|$|Quad {{have now}} brought out five {{generations of the}} classic {{electrostatic}} design. Originally designed for monaural sound in a domestic context, the popularisation of stereophonic sound prompted the manufacturer to modify the electrostatic panels to improve their stereo dispersion. These speakers featured larger panels and a revolutionary stator design, made up of eight concentric rings fed from the centre <b>outwards</b> through analogue delay lines, so that the audio signal gives the illusion of radiating from a point source one foot behind the panel.|$|E
5|$|Stela 10 {{was found}} in Group 21 {{together}} with Altar 6. They are among the very few monuments that were placed outside of the ceremonial centre of the city. Stela 10 was carved with a frame containing a figure, now badly eroded. The figure is standing with feet separated and turned <b>outwards.</b> Small hieroglyphic panels accompany it. Stela 10 had been moved from its original location, which was probably somewhere nearby.|$|E
5|$|The Ingeborg, {{built in}} 1776, had an eight-12-pounder {{centerline}} armament which {{was open to}} the elements, but two heavy 18-pounders in the bow and two 6-pounder chase guns in the stern. The rowing benches with room for three men per bench were {{on either side of}} the centerline battery, but had to swing forwards and <b>outwards</b> to allow the guns to pivot to either side.|$|E
5|$|The core is {{the only}} region in the Sun that {{produces}} an appreciable amount of thermal energy through fusion; 99% of the power is generated within 24% of the Sun's radius, and by 30% of the radius, fusion has stopped nearly entirely. The remainder of the Sun is heated by this energy as it is transferred <b>outwards</b> through many successive layers, finally to the solar photosphere where it escapes into space as sunlight or the kinetic energy of particles.|$|E
5|$|The crucial factor which {{frustrated}} firefighting efforts was the narrowness of the streets. Even {{under normal}} circumstances, {{the mix of}} carts, wagons, and pedestrians in the undersized alleys was subject to frequent traffic jams and gridlock. During the fire, the passages were additionally blocked by refugees camping in them amongst their rescued belongings, or escaping <b>outwards,</b> away from the centre of destruction, as demolition teams and fire engine crews struggled in vain to move in towards it.|$|E
5|$|The first {{roads in}} the Peak were {{constructed}} by the Romans, although they may have followed existing tracks. The Roman network {{is thought to have}} linked the settlements and forts of Aquae Arnemetiae (Buxton), Chesterfield, Ardotalia (Glossop) and Navio (Brough and Shatton), and extended <b>outwards</b> to Danum (Doncaster), Mamucium (Manchester) and Derventio (Little Chester, near Derby). Parts of the modern A515 and A53 roads south of Buxton are believed to run along Roman roads.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum is}} {{constructed}} from bare reinforced concrete. The primary museum floor is lifted six metres {{above the ground}} on huge piloti and is accessible via a free-standing staircase. The rhythmical facade comprises vertical elements that repeat <b>outwards</b> from the centre. Like the exterior, the interior is finished with rough concrete; {{the idea was to}} keep the surfaces plain so that nothing could distract the visitor from the contents of the exhibits.|$|E
5|$|There {{had also}} been {{criticism}} of the proposed definition of double planet: at present the Moon {{is defined as a}} satellite of the Earth, but over time the Earth-Moon barycenter will drift <b>outwards</b> (see tidal acceleration) and could eventually become situated outside of both bodies. This development would then upgrade the Moon to planetary status at that time, according to the redefinition. The time taken for this to occur, however, would be billions of years, long after many astronomers expect the Sun to expand into a red giant and destroy both Earth and Moon.|$|E
5|$|To have {{sufficient}} {{space for the}} planned New Orleans Square section, the Disneyland Railroad's track on {{the western edge of}} its route was expanded <b>outwards</b> again in 1962, Frontierland Station's depot building in that same vicinity was moved across the DRR's track, and a covered platform with no station building was built on the opposite side to serve as the new Frontierland Station. Although the station was no longer in the Frontierland section, its name was not changed to New Orleans Square Station until September 1996.|$|E
5|$|Two {{or three}} feet of snow may turn into less than a foot of ice. The weight above makes deeper layers of ice thin and flow <b>outwards.</b> Ice is lost {{at the edges of}} the glacier to icebergs, or to summer melting, and the overall shape of the glacier does not change much with time. The outward flow can distort the layers, so it is {{desirable}} to drill deep ice cores at places where there is very little flow. These can be located using maps of the flow lines.|$|E
5|$|Two skull bones, the {{lacrimal}} and postorbital bones, projected {{into the}} eye socket {{from the front}} and back, nearly dividing it into two compartments. The eye would have been located in the upper compartment, which was tilted slightly <b>outwards</b> in Carnotaurus, perhaps providing some degree of binocular vision. The lacrimal and postorbital also met above the eye socket, to form a ridge or brow above the eye.|$|E
5|$|A {{feature of}} the wing, which contributed greatly to its success, was an {{innovative}} spar boom design, made up of five square tubes that fitted into each other. As the wing thinned out along its span the tubes were progressively cut away {{in a similar fashion}} to a leaf spring; two of these booms were linked together by an alloy web, creating a lightweight and very strong main spar. The undercarriage legs were attached to pivot points built into the inner, rear section of the main spar and retracted <b>outwards</b> and slightly backwards into wells in the non-load-carrying wing structure. The resultant narrow undercarriage track was considered to be an acceptable compromise as this reduced the bending loads on the main-spar during landing.|$|E
5|$|Blast Corps is a single-player action video game. The player {{controls}} {{vehicles to}} destroy buildings, farms, and other {{structures in the}} path of a runaway nuclear missile carrier. The player fails if the carrier collides with an object. The eight demolition vehicles vary in the way they clear structures: the bulldozer rams, the dump truck drifts, the lightweight buggy crashes from higher ground, the tricycle shoots missiles, another truck presses <b>outwards</b> from its sides, and robot mechs tumble and stomp from the land and the air. The player must transfer between vehicles and other machinery to solve puzzles. Objectives include transporting timed explosive crates and bridging gaps. The game's puzzles increase in difficulty as the player progresses through its 57 levels.|$|E
5|$|Chadderton's modern {{commercial}} centre lies {{close to}} the boundary with Oldham; the expansion of Oldham in the mid-19th century caused urbanisation along the eastern boundary of Chadderton, which spread <b>outwards</b> {{into the rest of}} the township. Continued growth in the late-19th and early-20th centuries gave rise to a densely populated, industrial landscape of factories and rows of terraced housing, typical of mill towns in Northern England. There is a mixture of high-density urban areas, suburbs and semi-rural locations in Chadderton, but overwhelmingly the land use in the town is urban. The soils of Chadderton are sand based, with subsoils of clay and gravel.|$|E
5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta is a crustose lichen, {{because it}} {{grows in the}} form of a surface crust. The thallus, or body of the lichen is spread out flat and can be either tightly to loosely {{attached}} to the growing surface. It is 0.15–0.30mm thick, and can be smooth, or have low radiating ridges. The older, central region of the lichen surface has many reproductive structures called isidia; they resemble granules that are 0.1–0.4 by 0.1mm. The species relies entirely on vegetative means to reproduce, and is not known to have any sexual structures. From the center <b>outwards,</b> three color zones can be differentiated in mature specimens; the first grayish-green, the second white, and finally a bright red cottony rim.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus olla bears a {{resemblance}} to a miniature bird's nest containing eggs, hence the common name bird's nest fungi. The fruiting body, or peridium, is roughly funnel-shaped, 10–18mm tall and 8–12mm wide. It is greyish yellow or greyish brown to fawn-colored {{and covered with}} even, fine-textured hairs on the outside surface. The inner surface is silver grey and smooth, often with faint transverse ridges. Cyathus olla is thick-walled, and flared <b>outwards</b> at the rim; the rim is typically wavy in outline. The 'eggs', or peridioles, typically number 8 to 10 in the cup, and they are white or grey in color, with a diameter of 2–4mm—conspicuously larger than other Cyathus species. They are covered with a thin membrane called a tunica.|$|E
5|$|Dinocephalosaurus {{may also}} have used its neck to capture its prey via suction feeding. After flexing its neck to the side (which would have been {{facilitated}} by the slenderness of the cervical ribs), the act of straightening the neck would have caused the cervical ribs to splay <b>outwards</b> due to {{the action of the}} neck muscles attached to the ribs. As the head lunged forward, the volume of the esophagus would have increased, creating suction. Once the prey was caught, the fang-like teeth would have secured the prey in the mouth. Like other aquatic amniotes, Dinocephalosaurus would have swallowed and digested its prey head-first, as evinced by the preservation of a perleidid fish in the abdominal region of LPV 30280 from Luoping.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{presence}} of valence 5f electrons, neptunium and its alloys exhibit very interesting magnetic behavior, like many other actinides. These can range from the itinerant band-like character characteristic of the transition metals to the local moment behavior typical of scandium, yttrium, and the lanthanides. This stems from 5f-orbital hybridization with the orbitals of the metal ligands, {{and the fact that the}} 5f orbital is relativistically destabilized and extends <b>outwards.</b> For example, pure neptunium is paramagnetic, NpAl3 is ferromagnetic, NpGe3 has no magnetic ordering, and NpSn3 behaves fermionically. Investigations are underway regarding alloys of neptunium with uranium, americium, plutonium, zirconium, and iron, so as to recycle long-lived waste isotopes such as neptunium-237 into shorter-lived isotopes more useful as nuclear fuel.|$|E
