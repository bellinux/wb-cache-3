5|$|As a {{description}} of the origin of the universe, the Big Bang has significant bearing on religion and philosophy. As a result, it {{has become one of the}} liveliest areas in the discourse between science and religion. Some believe the Big Bang implies a creator, and some see its mention in their holy books, while <b>others</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Big Bang cosmology makes the notion of a creator superfluous.|$|E
5|$|Hetch Hetchy {{represented}} {{the first great}} environmental controversy in the US, and debate over the dam and reservoir continues today. Preservationist {{groups such as the}} Sierra Club lobby for the restoration of the valley, while <b>others</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> leaving the dam in place would be the better economic and environmental decision.|$|E
5|$|<b>Others</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> {{there is}} no {{available}} evidence that demonstrates {{that any of these}} organisms are capable of causing aphthous stomatitis by themselves. Some people with aphthous stomatitis may show herpes virus within the epithelium of the mucosa, but without any productive infection. In some persons, attacks of ulceration occur {{at the same time as}} asymptomatic viral shedding and elevated viral titres. However, antiviral medication has no effect on aphthous stomatitis.|$|E
25|$|Lee and <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> snakes {{were the}} {{descendants}} of mosasaurs.|$|R
25|$|Schultz and <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{the type}} {{specimen}} of Apatomerus mirus was not actually a pterosaur fossils.|$|R
25|$|Hone and <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the crests of many {{pterosaur}} {{species were}} {{a result of}} mutual sexual selection.|$|R
5|$|Scholars also {{debate the}} exact {{influence}} of Jewish thought on Durkheim's work. The answer remains uncertain; {{some scholars have}} argued that Durkheim's thought {{is a form of}} secularized Jewish thought, while <b>others</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> proving the existence of a direct influence of Jewish thought on Durkheim's achievements is difficult or impossible.|$|E
5|$|Some {{put forth}} that this intermixing of species {{is against the}} teachings of the Talmud and thus against Jewish Law and nonkosher. <b>Others</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the one in sixty parts law of kashrut is of significance, and that the foreign gene {{accounts}} for the less than 1/60 of the animal and thus the modified salmon is kosher.|$|E
5|$|The {{degree to}} which the {{character}} of Alice can be identified as Alice Liddell is controversial. Some critics identify the character as Liddell, or write that she inspired the character. <b>Others</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Carroll considered his protagonist and Liddell to be separate. According to Carroll, his character was not based on any real child, but was entirely fictional.|$|E
25|$|Free Software Foundation and <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> no {{software}} {{should be}} patented unless it passes machine-or-transformation test, as this blocks both innovation and scientific collaboration.|$|R
50|$|Alternative {{currents}} {{in the mainstream}} and branches of heterodox economics argue differently, with some <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> budget deficits are always harmful, and <b>others</b> <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> budget deficits are not only beneficial, but also necessary.|$|R
40|$|During the Bush administration, as {{democracy}} assistance {{evolved from}} being a relatively uncontroversial U. S. policy with bipartisan support to a controversial policy associated with the neoconservative agenda, academics, journalists and others hastened to identify the political costs of doing democracy work. Critics of democracy assistance <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> encouraging elections too quickly in war torn countries could exacerbate ethnic tensions and ensure greater instability. <b>Others</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> more democracy would bring anti-American leaders to power, particularly in Muslim countries, while still <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> for poor unstable countries, stability, security and economic development should all be higher priorities than democracy...|$|R
5|$|The {{extent to}} which both Graffham and Fortitude North {{influenced}} German strategy in Scandinavia is disputed, with some historians arguing that very little of either deception reached the enemy. While <b>others</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the existence of fictional units in Scotland helped confirm German fears of a diversionary attack in the region.|$|E
5|$|There is {{continuing}} critical {{debate about the}} status of the poem as it is now available to us. While some scholars accept the texts of the Hymn as more or less accurate transmissions of Cædmon's original, <b>others</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> they originated as a back-translation from Bede's Latin, and that there is no surviving witness to the original text.|$|E
5|$|Free {{hydrochloric}} acid was first formally {{described in the}} 16th century by Libavius, who prepared it by heating salt in clay crucibles. Other authors claim that pure {{hydrochloric acid}} was first discovered by the German Benedictine monk Basil Valentine in the 15th century, when he heated common salt and green vitriol, whereas <b>others</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> {{there is no clear}} reference to the preparation of pure hydrochloric acid {{until the end of the}} 16th century.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s and 1970s Dr John X. W. P. Corcoran and <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{the group}} in fact {{consisted}} of three contemporary types, and later excavations have supported this.|$|R
5000|$|Freud, among <b>others,</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> neither {{predominantly}} different- nor same-sex sexuality {{were the}} norm, instead {{that what is}} called [...] "bisexuality" [...] is the normal human condition thwarted by society.|$|R
25|$|Milton Friedman and <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> a corporation's {{purpose is}} to {{maximize}} returns to its shareholders and that obeying {{the laws of the}} jurisdictions within which it operates constitutes socially responsible behavior.|$|R
5|$|However, <b>others</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the Sun is {{currently}} {{close to the}} galactic plane, and yet the last great extinction event was 15 million years ago. Therefore, the Sun's vertical position cannot alone explain such periodic extinctions, and that extinctions instead occur when the Sun passes through the galaxy's spiral arms. Spiral arms are home not only to larger numbers of molecular clouds, whose gravity may distort the Oort cloud, but also to higher concentrations of bright blue giants, which live for relatively short periods and then explode violently as supernovae.|$|E
5|$|In 1545, from Southsea Castle, he {{witnessed}} his flagship Mary Rose sink {{with the loss}} of about 500 lives, whilst going into action against the French fleet in the Battle of the Solent. Some historians believe that the Mary Rose turned too quickly and submerged her open gun ports, whereas <b>others</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> it sank due to its poor design. Over the years, Portsmouth's fortifications were rebuilt and improved by successive monarchs. In 1563, Portsmouth suffered from an outbreak of a plague, resulting in about 300 deaths out of the town's population of 2000.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} {{debate whether}} the Ming dynasty had sovereignty over Tibet. Some {{believe it was}} a relationship of loose suzerainty that was largely cut off when the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–67) persecuted Buddhism in favor of Daoism at court. <b>Others</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the significant religious nature of the relationship with Tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship. Others note the Ming need for Central Asian horses and the need to maintain the tea-horse trade.|$|E
2500|$|Alberto Gonzales and <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> detainees {{should be}} {{considered}} [...] "unlawful combatants" [...] and as such not be protected by the Geneva Conventions in multiple memoranda regarding these perceived legal gray areas.|$|R
2500|$|Coe and <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> ferns were {{probably}} a major food source for herbivorous dinosaurs like ceratopsids {{and may have}} grown in vast [...] "prairies" [...] that could feed large numbers of dinosaurs.|$|R
5000|$|Alberto Gonzales and <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> detainees {{should be}} {{considered}} [...] "unlawful combatants" [...] and as such not be protected by the Geneva Conventions in multiple memoranda regarding these perceived legal gray areas.|$|R
5|$|<b>Others</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> {{while the}} issues of {{increasing}} public costs are real, the importance of continued growth of OHSU for the city's economy must be factored in as well. Not only is it the largest employer in the city, but OHSU is an important and effective vehicle to attract both federal funding, totaling more than 168million dollars for 2005, and a highly skilled workforce to the area. The growth in the current campus on the Marquam Hill is limited by access roads and parking, an expansion of which would likely cause more dramatic harm to the surrounding communities.|$|E
5|$|Some {{critics and}} historians argue that one {{characteristic}} of the Silver Age was that science fiction and aliens replaced magic and gods. <b>Others</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> magic was {{an important element of}} both Golden Age and Silver Age characters. Many Golden Age writers and artists were science-fiction fans or professional science-fiction writers who incorporated SF elements into their comic-book stories. Science was a common explanation for the origin of heroes in the Silver Age.|$|E
5|$|These {{statutes}} {{have been}} upheld as exercises of Congress's Commerce Clause power, {{or in the}} case of the mail fraud and program bribery statutes, the Postal Clause and the Spending Clause, respectively. In the special case where a member of Congress is the defendant, the Speech or Debate Clause places certain restrictions on the actions that can be prosecuted and proved up. Some commentators have argued that prosecutions of state and local officials under these statutes pose substantial federalism questions, while <b>others</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the Guarantee Clause provides additional authority for such prosecutions.|$|E
50|$|Some {{felt that}} such {{resilience}} was desirable {{in the face}} of random errors (e.g., line noise), while <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> error correcting increased the scope for attackers to maliciously tamper with a message.|$|R
2500|$|Clark and <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> it was {{impossible}} to know whether or not Velociraptor was a predator of Protoceratops based on the famous [...] "fighting dinosaurs" [...] specimen, since this was only one specimen.|$|R
50|$|Xiong {{believed}} that it was unwise to defend Shenyang, which although a major city, was located on empty land and therefore more vulnerable to attack. <b>Others</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> it could not be lightly abandoned.|$|R
5|$|A {{cause and}} effect {{methodology}} led to a relatively value-free approach to economic science, in which Cantillon was uninterested in the merit of any particular economic action or phenomenon, focusing rather on the explanation of relationships. This led Cantillon to separate economic science from politics and ethics {{to a greater degree}} than previous mercantilist writers. This has led to disputes on whether Cantillon can justly be considered a mercantilist or one of the first anti-mercantilists, given that Cantillon often cited government-manipulated trade surpluses and specie accumulation as positive economic stimuli. <b>Others</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> in instances where Cantillon is thought to have supported certain mercantilist policies, he actually provided a more neutral analysis by explicitly stating possible limitations of mercantilist policies.|$|E
5|$|From 1911 to 1917, {{money was}} {{collected}} for interior furnishings, which were relatively sparse {{apart from the}} impressive main altar. (These original furnishings remained until the 1930s.) Parts of the draft plan were abandoned: the floor was not constructed from marble as intended, but poured from plain concrete; outside there were no pinnacles on the façade. Writings vary on when the pinnacles were built: some claim they were built in 1923, but <b>others</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> they were not completed until the renovation of the cathedral in 1999. Observers that argue for an earlier construction date state that they were damaged during World WarII and left dismantled for some time.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} logo, the upheld torch, {{is derived}} from the Statue of Liberty, signifying NYU's service to New York City. The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer Tom Geismar of the branding and design firm Chermayeff & Geismar. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, violet. Some believe that it may have been chosen because violets are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. <b>Others</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with Athens, the center of learning in ancient Greece.|$|E
50|$|Alberta, among <b>others,</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{there were}} no flaws in the present {{passport}} system {{that could not be}} fixed, and that the proposed Act contained nothing that could not be found in current provincial legislation.|$|R
50|$|This short work by Schaeffer is {{an answer}} to the work of B.F. Skinner and <b>others,</b> <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> the freedom and dignity of man are God-given and {{therefore}} can't be left aside without dire consequences.|$|R
50|$|Some in the {{industry}} blamed cinema's drain of talent from the vaudeville circuits for the medium's demise. <b>Others</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> vaudeville had allowed its performances to become too familiar to its famously loyal, now seemingly fickle audiences.|$|R
