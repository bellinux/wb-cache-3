50|$|Natural gas {{distributors}} {{were required}} to add thiols, originally ethanethiol, to natural gas (which is naturally odorless) after the deadly New London School explosion in New London, Texas, in 1937. Many gas distributors were odorizing gas prior to this event. Most gas odorants utilized currently contain mixtures of mercaptans and sulfides, with t-butyl mercaptan as the main odor constituent in natural gas and ethanethiol in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG, propane). In situations where thiols are used in commercial industry, such as liquid petroleum gas tankers and bulk handling systems, an <b>oxidizing</b> <b>catalyst</b> is used to destroy the odor. A copper-based oxidation catalyst neutralizes the volatile thiols and transforms them into inert products.|$|E
50|$|Au-Ag alloy {{nanoparticles}} {{have been}} shown to have a synergistic effect on the oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO). On its own, each pure-metal nanoparticle shows very poor catalytic activity for CO oxidation; together, the catalytic properties are greatly enhanced. It is proposed that the gold acts as a strong binding agent for the oxygen atom and the silver serves as a strong <b>oxidizing</b> <b>catalyst,</b> although the exact mechanism is still not completely understood. When synthesized in an Au/Ag ratio from 3:1 to 10:1, the alloyed nanoparticles showed complete conversion when 1% CO was fed in air at ambient temperature. Interestingly, the size of the alloyed particles did not play a big role in the catalytic ability. It is well known that gold nanoparticles only show catalytic properties for CO when they are ~3 nm in size, but alloyed particles up to 30 nm demonstrated excellent catalytic activity - catalytic activity better than that of gold nanoparticles on active support such as TiO2, Fe2O3, etc.|$|E
50|$|The radical {{mechanism}} {{was directly}} challenged {{in a short}} communication in 1995, when Olinga and François noted that thiophene could be polymerized by ferric chloride in acetonitrile, a solvent in which the catalyst is completely soluble. Their analysis of the kinetics of thiophene polymerization also seemed to contradict the predictions of the radical polymerization mechanism. Barbarella et al. studied the oligomerization of 3-(alkylsulfanyl)thiophenes, and concluded from their quantum mechanical calculations, and considerations of the enhanced stability of the radical cation when delocalized over a planar conjugated oligomer, that a radical cation mechanism analogous to that generally accepted for electrochemical polymerization was more likely (Figure 6, bottom). Given the difficulties of studying a system with a heterogeneous, strongly <b>oxidizing</b> <b>catalyst</b> that produces difficult to characterize rigid-rod polymers, the mechanism of oxidative polymerization {{is by no means}} decided. However, the radical cation mechanism shown in Figure 6 is generally accepted as the most likely route for PT synthesis.|$|E

40|$|The {{oxidative}} dehydrogenation of propane in {{the absence}} of O 2 over the vanadia-based EL 10 V 1 Eurocat catalyst is investigated in a Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP) reactor over a completely <b>oxidized</b> <b>catalyst</b> and at reduction degrees up to 0. 47. Only CO 2 and propene are detected as reaction products at temperatures from 723 to 823 K. The reduction of the catalyst with propane occurs through the formation of propene, the consecutive oxidation of propene to CO 2 and the parallel total oxidation of propane. Four elementary reactions are considered as kinetically relevant: (1) the methyl C–H bond dissociation in propane during the formation of propene, (2) the methylene C–H bond breaking in propane to form surface isopropoxide, which finally transforms into CO 2, (3) the CC double bond breaking in propene in the formation of surface formate species and (4) the oxidation of these surface formate species to CO 2. The formation of propene via (1) is favored at the investigated conditions, while CO 2 is largely produced by the sequential oxidation of propene (3 – 4), {{and to a lesser extent}} by the parallel route of the direct total oxidation of propane (2). Both the oxidative dehydrogenation and the direct total oxidation of propane reaction paths involve only one kinetically relevant step, (1) respectively (2), with an activation energy of 36 and 74 kJ mol− 1 over a completely <b>oxidized</b> <b>catalyst</b> and of 15 and 40 kJ mol− 1 over a partially reduced catalyst. The further oxidation of propene involves two kinetically relevant steps (3 – 4) of which only the double bond breaking (3) is slightly activated (5 kJ mol− 1) over the completely <b>oxidized</b> <b>catalyst,</b> while both steps are non-activated when the catalyst is partially reduced...|$|R

Participation of surface ceria, induced by the strong interaction with copper, to reduction/oxidation reactions in the temperature range explored (up to 430 *C) has been demonstrated.

The gratest difficulty encountered in the estination of sulfur seems to lie in the insufficient ashing of the substance.

One of these materials is cerium dioxide (ceria, CeO 2), which is used extensively as an integral component of 3 -way catalyst in automobiles. In order to exploit the synergy of a composite made up of the active carrier and the participating support, formulations consisting of two-phase mixtures of copper oxide, iron oxide and manganese oxide with pure or doped ceria were fabricated and evaluated for their reactivity in methane and syngas fuel streams. Relevant parameter of significance to CLC process, such as fuel conversion, oxygen release measurement, fluidization properties and, temperature variations during fuel and oxidation cycles, were examined. All the samples showed very good fluidization properties during tests without any agglomeration. Copper oxide-based oxygen carriers showed nearly full conversion of methane with high oxygen release and no sign of defluidization, while iron-based systems exhibited unusually high conversion of methane together with favourable reactivity during oxidation periods after the fuel cycles.

40|$|EFFECT OF ALTERNATIVE FUELS ON THE AFTERTREATMENT DEVICE. by BUNPREET SINGH Dec 2010 Advisor: 	Dr. Dinu Taraza Major:		Mechanical Engineering Degree:	Master of Science There is {{no doubt}} that globally, {{alternative}} fuels have attained the center of attention {{in order to reduce the}} dependency on fossil fuels. A lot of research has been conducted on the alternative fuels in the automotive industry pertaining to the sustainability, engine performance and the emission characteristics. The focus of this study is to investigate the effect of alternative fuels (JP 8, Soy-based B 20, and S 8) on the aftertreatment device. Different fuel properties (both physical and chemical properties) affect the in cylinder combustion and engine out emissions. The research is conducted on a multi-cylinder commercial diesel engine (MBE 926) and the aftertreatment device is comprised of a Diesel <b>Oxidizing</b> <b>Catalyst</b> (D. O.

40|$|A {{molecular}} system {{capable of}} photoinduced water splitting {{is an attractive}} approach to solar energy conversion. This thesis deals with the functional characterization of molecular building blocks for the three principal functions of such a molecular system: Photoinduced accumulative charge separation, catalytic water oxidation, and catalytic proton reduction. Systems combining a ruthenium-trisbipyridine photosensitizer with multi-electron donors in form of dinuclear ruthenium or manganese complexes were investigated {{in view of the}} rate constants of electron transfer and excited state quenching. The kinetics were studied in the different oxidation states of the donor unit by combination of electrochemistry and time resolved spectroscopy. The rapid excited state quenching by the multi-electron donors points to the importance of redox intermediates for efficient accumulative photooxidation of the terminal donor. The redox behavior of manganese complexes as mimics of the water <b>oxidizing</b> <b>catalyst</b> in the natural photosynthetic reaction center was studied by electrochemical and spectroscopic methods. For a dinuclear manganese complex ligand exchange reactions were studied in view of their importance for the accumulative oxidation of the complex and its reactivity towards water. With the binding of substrate water, multiple oxidation in a narrow potential range and concomitant deprotonation of the bound water it was demonstrated that the manganese complex is capable of mimicking multiple aspects of photosynthetic water oxidation. A dinuclear iron complex was investigated as biomimetic proton reduction catalyst. The complex structurally mimics the active site of the iron-only hydrogenase enzyme and was designed to hold a proton on the bridging ligand and a hydride on the iron centers.

40|$|The {{principles}} of natures own light-driven water splitting catalyst, Photosystem II (PSII), {{can in the}} future inspire us to use water as electron and proton source to generate light-driven H 2 production. To mimic this challenging step, {{it is important to}} understand how the enzyme system can oxidize water. The mechanism of light-driven water oxidation in PSII is in this thesis addressed by EPR spectroscopy. P 680 + is a strong oxidant formed by light-oxidation of the chlorophyll species P 680 positioned in the center of PSII. The redox active tyrosine-Z (YZ) can reduce P 680 + and the YZ• radical is formed. This transient radical is further reduced by the CaMn 4 -cluster, which is the binding site of the substrate water molecules. In a cyclic process called the S-cycle, this catalytic cluster accumulates four oxidizing equivalents to evolve one molecule of O 2 and to oxidize two molecules of water. We can induce the YZ• radical at cryogenic temperatures in the different oxidation states of the catalytic S-cycle and observe this in metalloradical EPR signals. These metalloradical EPR signals are here characterized and used to deduce mechanistic information from the intact PSII. The "double nature" of these spin-spin interaction signals, so called split EPR signals, makes them excellent probes to both YZ oxidation and, when YZ• is present, also to the S-states of the CaMn 4 -cluster. The metalloradical EPR signals presented here, form a way to study the transient YZ• radical in active PSII that has not been depleted of the catalytic metal cluster. This depleting method that has often been used in the past to study YZ is not representing studies of a mechanistically relevant material. The previously suggested disorder around YZ and accessibility to the bulk can be artifactual properties induced in the mechanistically defect PSII. On the contrary, our observation that proton coupled electron transfer from YZ to the light induced P 680 + can occur in a high yield at cryogenic temperatures, suggests a well ordered catalytic site in the protein positioned for optimal performance. The optimized positioning of the redox components found in PSII might be a feature also important to build in an efficient water <b>oxidizing</b> <b>catalyst...</b>|$|E
40|$|The current Spark Ignited (SI) engine {{equipped}} with three-way catalyst offers low emissions, but has low efficiency at part load, {{which results in}} unnecessarily high CO 2 emissions. The Compression Ignited (CI) engines have higher efficiency and hence lower CO 2 emissions, but suffer from higher Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) and Particulate Matter (PM) emissions, and no three-way catalyst can be used. Large efforts are made to reduce the emissions of the CI engine and raise {{the efficiency of the}} SI engine. A third internal combustion engine type, which combines the principles of the SI and CI engines, has the potential to meet demands from society in terms of current and foreseeable future emissions regulations. This engine type is called Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine. It utilizes a homogeneous premixed air fuel mixture like the SI engine, but the mixture is compressed to auto ignition like in the CI engine. Very dilute mixtures are used to slow down the combustion rate. This results in a low combustion temperature with extremely low NOx emissions. Due to the homogeneous charge the combustion produces no PM. The Carbon Monoxide (CO) and unburned Hydrocarbon (HC) emissions are, however, higher than for the other engine types due to the low combustion temperature, but an <b>oxidizing</b> <b>catalyst</b> can quite easily treat CO and HC emissions. Combustion control of the HCCI engine is a challenge since there is no direct means to control when combustion starts unlike the SI or CI engines. Combustion phasing in an HCCI engine can be achieved by affecting the time history of pressure and temperature in the cylinder. The most common way to do this in the lab has been to control the inlet air temperature and thereby the temperature in the cylinder {{at the end of the}} compression stroke. With an electrical heater this is a slow parameter to control. In the present study a multi cylinder engine {{equipped with}} Variable Compression Ratio (VCR) and a Fast Thermal Management (FTM) system is used to control the combustion phasing. Both the Closed-Loop Combustion Control (CLCC) using VCR and the CLCC using FTM are the first presented such systems on a multi cylinder engine in the literature. A system identification is made and a Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller is designed for the fast thermal management instead of the standard PID controller. CLCC performance of both PID and the state feedback based LQG controllers using fast thermal management are investigated by perfroming step response experiments. A CLCC strategy using variable compression ratio and a cylinder individual fast thermal management is presented and investigated experimentally by running a hot drive cycle test. To this date it is the first experimental drive cycle test using inlet air preheated HCCI, i. e. FTM. It is concluded that the proposed CLCC strategy in terms of fuel consumption is good enough, but in terms of emissions there is still some room for improvement. For a scaled engine to 3. 0 L an improvement in fuel consumption of 16 % is accomplished compared to an SI simulation using mean steady state data from the same engine, with an EC 2000 drive cycle calculated for a 1. 6 L Opel Astra. If doing an imagined mode transfer without scaling the engine a fuel consumption of 6. 8 L/ 100 km is achieved. Due to very high friction losses of this engine a simulation with lower friction losses of a modern engine is made, which result in a 15 % improvement in fuel consumption compared to an ?ideal? simulated HCCI drive cycle test with this engine. With an optimized controller and an optimized engine in terms of friction losses a fuel consumption of 5. 8 L/ 100 km is realistic for the HCCI-SI approach...|$|E

This {{study was}} to {{evaluate}} the modified Fenton reactions (RFM), through the addition of six complexing organic separately in each reaction, these being: ascorbic acid (AA), citric acid (CA), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), gluconic acid (AG), oxalic acid (OA) and tartaric acid (TA), the degradation of textile effluent under varying molar ratios between the total organic carbon, [Fe 2 +], complexing and [H 2 O 2]. In RFM and Fenton reactions (RF) reactor was used consisting of a borosilicate beaker with a maximum volume of 250 mL, in batch, open, without stirring under room temperature in the optimization phase of time aliquots were removed in the effluent times: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 h. The procedure consisted of addition of 250 mL of textile effluent to the reactor for RF and RFM, followed by the oxidant and a catalyst for the RF and <b>oxidizing</b> <b>catalyst</b> and complexing to RFM. RF best results in reduction of TOC was obtained in 12 h treatment under initial pH value of 3. 0 and a molar ratio [1 : 0, 9 : 27, 5]. Concerning the [COT:Fe 2 +:H 2 O 2] where noted a reduction of 91. 06 % of TOC, COD 94. 51 %, 99. 88 % and 99. 02 % of the turbidity of discoloration. The RFM showed the best results {{with the use of}} complexing GA at 15 h of treatment under molar ratio [1 : 1, 31 : 1, 12 : 27, 94], its [COT:Fe 2 +:AG:H 2 O 2] which promoted reduction of 82. 30 % of TOC, COD 90. 53 %, 99. 27 % and 99. 19 % of the turbidity of discoloration, TA had similar results in reduction of parameters when the effluent subjected to 12 h of treatment in a molar ratio [1 : 0, 76 : 0, 94 : 32, 13]. Concerning the [COT:Fe 2 +:AT:H 2 O 2] under these conditions was possible to reduce 75. 05 % TOC, 94. 89 % COD, 97. 84 % turbidity and discoloration of 96. 75 %. However, RF are effective in the treatment of textile effluents, though the RFM presented as a new possibility of the treatment without the necessity of adjusting the initial pH value...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of fatty acids by Fischer-Tropsch-type synthesis was investigated with ferric oxide, ammonium carbonate, potassium carbonate, powdered Pueblito de Allende carbonaceous chondrite, and filings from the Canyon Diablo meteorite used as catalysts. Products were separated and identified by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Iron oxide, Pueblito de Allende chondrite, and Canyon Diablo filings in an <b>oxidized</b> <b>catalyst</b> form yielded no fatty acids. Canyon Diablo filings heated overnight at 500 C while undergoing slow purging by deuterium produced fatty acids only when potassium carbonate was admixed; potassium carbonate alone also produced these compounds. The active catalytic combinations gave relatively high yields of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons; {{substantial amounts of}} n-alkenes were almost invariably observed when fatty acids were produced; the latter were in the range C 6 to C 18, with maximum yield in C 9 or 10...|$|R

40|$|The {{properties}} of K 2 CO 3 /MoS 2 oxidized {{at room temperature}} {{and the effects of}} thermal treatments of the sample on its catalytic activity and physicochemical properties were investigated by means of temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared, X-ray diffraction and electron spin resonance. The TPD exhibited four peaks of SO 2 evolution. Among them, three peaks originated from the decomposition of surface SO 42 - species with C- 2 v and T-d symmetries. The decomposition of sulfate by heat treatment resulted in the production of SO 2 and oxidized molybdenum species such as MoO 3 + which were converted to MoO 2 by further heat treatment. The thermal treatment of <b>oxidized</b> <b>catalyst</b> above 1013 K caused a solid-state reaction between potassium and molybdenum, producing K 2 MoO 4. The treated catalyst on which the surface SO 42 - species had been removed, recovered their selectivity to alcohol formation in CO-H- 2 reactions which had been lost when the catalysts were oxidizedclose 5...|$|R
40|$|The {{emission}} rate for ammonia from in-use vehicles {{is calculated based on}} measurements made inside a Los Angeles roadway tunnel. Using fleet distributions by vehicle age and type, known catalyst distributions, and fuel economy by model year and vehicle type and attributing all ammonia to {{vehicles equipped with}} three-way catalysts or three-way <b>catalysts</b> plus <b>oxidizing</b> <b>catalysts</b> (dual-bed catalysts), we estimate an average ammonia {{emission rate}} of 72 mg km^(- 1) for these vehicles, or 61 mg km^(- 1) driven by the vehicle fleet as a whole. These emissions can emanate from vehicles running under rich air−fuel conditions, with three-way catalytic converters designed to reduce NO_x to N_ 2 and O_ 2 in addition forming NH_ 3. Resulting calculations estimate ammonia emissions of 24 − 29 t of NH_ 3 day^(- 1) from the vehicle fleet for the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) that surrounds Los Angeles. This represents an increase in the daily emissions of ammonia attributable to motor vehicles in the SoCAB from 2 % of basin wide emissions before the introduction of catalyst-equipped automobiles to 15 % based on the current experiment. The air basin wide emission rate of ammonia from motor vehicles is compared to ammonia emissions from livestock waste decomposition at local dairies, and the implications for control of fine particle ammonium nitrate concentrations are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work high energy {{resolution}} off-resonant X-ray spectroscopy (HEROS) was employed at a synchrotron {{to study a}} silica supported Ta(V) bisalkyl catalyst activated in hydrogen. The Ta Lα 1 HEROS spectra were measured during oxidation of the starting complex and the relative species’ concentration was successfully retrieved {{as a function of}} time using the fingerprint HEROS spectra measured for the unoxidized and the <b>oxidized</b> <b>catalyst.</b> Based on the experimental data and theory- based calculations, it was shown that oxidation of the active Ta catalyst leads to the formation of mono- and di-meric species on the SiO 2 surface. The obtained results were compared to those of the previously reported time-resolved HEROS study on an inactive silica supported Ta(V) bisalkyl catalyst’s concentration evolution during its oxidation Błachucki et al. (2015). The study allowed observation of an immediate transition of the active Ta catalyst from its unoxidized form to the oxidized one. This finding is dissimilar to the result of the study on the inactive Ta catalyst, where the oxidation led through an intermediate step...|$|R
