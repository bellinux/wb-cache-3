5|$|In these applications, one forms a graph {{in which}} each vertex {{represents}} a matched pair of atoms, one from each of two molecules. Two vertices are connected by an edge if the matches that they represent are compatible with each other. Being compatible may mean, for instance, that the distances between the atoms within the two molecules are approximately equal, to within some given tolerance. A clique in this graph represents a set of matched pairs of atoms {{in which all the}} matches are compatible with each other. A special case of this method is the use of the modular product of graphs to reduce the problem <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> the maximum common induced subgraph of two graphs to the problem <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> a maximum clique in their product.|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{decision}} support systems necessitate a disease knowledge base, which comprises a set <b>of</b> clinical <b>findings</b> for each disease. To efficiently represent the findings, this paper explores {{the relationship between}} clinical vocabulary and findings in medical literature through quantitative and qualitative analysis of representative disease databases. Although the data volume and the analyzed features are limited, the observations suggested the following. First, there are sets <b>of</b> clinical <b>findings</b> that are essential for physicians, but the majority <b>of</b> <b>findings</b> in medical literature are not the essential ones. Second, deviation of term frequency for clinical findings vocabulary is minimal, and clinical findings require appropriate grammar for efficient representation <b>of</b> <b>findings.</b> Third, appropriate mapping <b>of</b> clinical <b>findings</b> with clinical vocabulary would allow the efficient expression <b>of</b> clinical <b>findings.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of bounded expansion, the subgraph isomorphism problem, <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> whether a pattern graph of bounded size exists as a subgraph of a larger graph, can be solved in linear time when the larger graph has bounded book thickness.

For the same reason, the problem of testing whether a graph of bounded book thickness obeys a given formula of first order logic is fixed-parameter tractable.|$|E
