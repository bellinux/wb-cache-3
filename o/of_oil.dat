40|$|This {{research}} report aims {{to identify the}} impact of production <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> towards economic growth in Malaysia. The increasing demand of production <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> has contributing to the economic growth in Malaysia. However, production <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> in Malaysia has to compete with Indonesia and production <b>of</b> soybeans <b>oil</b> that are capable in producing more products. Thus, factors that most influence the economic growth in Malaysia need to be identified. The objectives {{of this study are}} to study the production <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> in Malaysia, to study the production <b>of</b> soybean <b>oil</b> in Malaysia and to determine whether capital or labor is the most factors influence the economic growth in Malaysia. The study used descriptive research design. It focused on the production <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> in Malaysia scope. It involved the selection and analysis of secondary data, journals and related write-up that are relating to production <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> in Malaysia that includes the factors that affecting production <b>of</b> palm <b>oil,</b> production <b>of</b> soybeans <b>oil,</b> capital and labor of production <b>of</b> palm <b>oil.</b> From the analysis of production <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> {{it can be seen that}} the total production is increasing year by year. There are constant increase in the production <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> and thus concluded that there is positive growth in the palm oil industry and the production of soybean is one factors that have contributed to the increasing the economic growth in Malaysia. On the other hand, the regression analysis clearly shows that the production <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> has positive relationship with the economic growth in Malaysia, and also positive relationship between production <b>of</b> soybeans <b>oil,</b> capital and labor of production <b>of</b> palm <b>oil.</b> Among all the factors. Production <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> and capital <b>of</b> production <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> has been identified as the factors that contribute the most economic growth in Malaysia...|$|R

5|$|An oil tanker, {{also known}} as a {{petroleum}} tanker, is a merchant ship designed for the bulk transport <b>of</b> <b>oil.</b> There are two basic types <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> tankers: crude tankers and product tankers. Crude tankers move large quantities of unrefined crude oil from its point of extraction to refineries. For example, moving crude oil from oil wells in Nigeria to the refineries on the coast of the United States. Product tankers, generally much smaller, are designed to move refined products from refineries to points near consuming markets. For example, moving gasoline from refineries in Europe to consumer markets in Nigeria and other West African nations.|$|E
