25|$|Dilution {{of indoor}} {{pollutants}} with outdoor air is effective {{to the extent}} that outdoor air is free of harmful pollutants. Ozone in outdoor air occurs indoors at reduced concentrations because ozone is highly reactive with many chemicals found indoors. The products of the reactions between ozone and many common indoor pollutants include organic compounds that may be more odorous, irritating, or toxic than those from which they are formed. These products of ozone chemistry include formaldehyde, higher molecular weight aldehydes, acidic aerosols, and fine and ultrafine particles, among others. The higher the outdoor ventilation rate, the higher the indoor <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> and the more likely the reactions will occur, but even at low levels, the reactions will take place. This suggests that ozone should be removed from ventilation air, especially in areas where outdoor ozone levels are frequently high. Recent research has shown that mortality and morbidity increase in the general population during periods of higher outdoor ozone and that the threshold for this effect is around 20 parts per billion (ppb).|$|E

In total about 500 Mt were atmospherically detonated between 1945 and 1971, peaking in 1961–62, when 340 Mt were detonated in the atmosphere by the United States and Soviet Union.

40|$|AbstractWhile {{the ozone}} layer in the {{stratosphere}} is shielding the Earth's surface from radioactivity, high <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the troposphere have damaging effects on plants, animals and humans when they exceed certain critical levels. This {{is why it is}} necessary to resolve successfully three tasks: 1. (i) to determine in a sufficiently accurate way, the critical levels of the <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations,</b> 2. (ii) to reduce the <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> to the critical levels, and 3. (iii) to develop reliable and robust control strategies by which the <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> can be kept under the critical levels. Both the second task and the third task are very expensive. Therefore, the high <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> must be reduced to the critical levels, but no more. Furthermore, it is necessary to reduce (as much as possible) the economical costs of these actions. Mathematical models can be used in the search of an optimal solution of the tasks listed above. A mathematical model for studying air pollution levels in Europe (the Danish Eulerian Model) will be shortly discussed. The model consists of a system of 35 partial differential equations and leads to huge computational tasks, when it is handled numerically. Therefore, it is necessary to use big modern high-speed computers (with vector and/or parallel capabilities). The Danish Eulerian Model has been used to run various scenarios in order to study some of the relationships between emission sources in Europe and high <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Modern visualization techniques have been applied to illustrate better the effects of different emission reductions used in the scenarios on the <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> and to draw some conclusions...|$|R
