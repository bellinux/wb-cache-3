5000|$|Diospyros texana is {{a species}} of {{persimmon}} that is native to central, south and west Texas and southwest Oklahoma in the United States, and eastern Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Le√≥n, and Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico. Common names include Texas persimmon, Mexican persimmon and the more ambiguous [...] "black persimmon". It is known in Spanish as chapote, chapote manzano, or chapote prieto, {{all of which are}} derived from the Nahuatl word tzapotl. That word also refers to several <b>other</b> <b>fruit-bearing</b> trees.|$|R

60|$|I {{rushed to}} them, {{and this was}} what I saw. Beneath us was a steep slope quite bare of forest, which ceased at its crest. This slope {{stretched}} downwards for half a mile or more to the lip of a beautiful lake, of which the area was perhaps two hundred acres. Set in {{the centre of the}} deep blue water of this lake, which we discovered afterwards to be unfathomable, was an island not more than five and twenty or thirty acres in extent, that seemed to be cultivated, for on it we could see fields, palms and <b>other</b> <b>fruit-bearing</b> trees. In the middle of the island stood a small, near house thatched after the fashion of the country, but civilized in its appearance, for it was oblong, not round, and encircled by a verandah and a reed fence. At a distance from this house were a number of native huts, and in front of it a small enclosure surrounded by a high wall, on the top of which mats were fixed on poles as though to screen something from wind or sun.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Cucumber {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} vegetable crops for the local consumption and exportation. The use of grafted vegetable seedlings has been popular in many countries during recent years. Growing <b>fruit-bearing</b> <b>vegetables,</b> chiefly tomato, cucumber and watermelon through grafted seedlings become a widespread practice worldwide. Grafting is a valuable technique to avoid soil-borne diseases, provide biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, enhance nutrient uptake, optimize water use, and increase fruit yield and quality. Vegetable grafting is a new topic in Iran and there are a limited number of studies on grafted vegetable production. However, attention to grafting by researchers has recently increased. Suitable rootstocks should be identified and characterized for the effective utilization of grafting. The rootstock's vigorous root system increases the efficiency of water and nutrient absorption, and may also serve as a source of endogenous plant hormones, thus leading to increased growth and yield in addition to disease control. In the present study, we investigated the response of two Cucurbita sp. and an Iranian melon as rootstocks for cucumber. Materials and methods: In order to study the effect of cucurbit rootstocks and grafting method on growth, yield and fruit quality of cucumber (Cucumis sativus cv. Super Dominus), an experiment was conducted as a factorial design in the base of RCBD with three replications in the greenhouse and research farm, University of Zanjan. Treatments were included three rootstocks (Cucurbita moschata L., Lagenaria siceraria and Cucumis melo L.) and ungrafted plants (control) and two grafting method (hole insertion and splice grafting). Seeds were sown simultaneously in plastic pots. For obtaining the same stem diameter of scion and rootstocks, cucumber seeds were planted four days earlier than rootstocks seeds. The seedlings were grown in an environment-controlled greenhouse with 25 / 20 day/night temperatures. When seedlings reached the first true leaf stage (diameter of the leaf was about 2 cm) the grafting was performed. After grafting, grafted plants were transferred to a mist chamber for post-graft care (> 95...|$|R
50|$|Tiwi {{began as}} a barrio of Malinao before it was {{formally}} organized as a politically independent pueblo in 1696. As a pueblo, it was governed by a gobernadorcillo. As a Catholic parish, it was administered by a secular priest under the then Diocese of Nueva Caceres, now an archdiocese. In its primeval stages, it had some 1,105 houses, a parish church, a community-funded primary school, and a cemetery outside the town proper. The villagers ordinarily engaged in fishing, planting rice, corn, sugarcane, indigo, <b>fruit-bearing</b> trees, and <b>vegetables.</b> Aside from agriculture, they also busied themselves weaving cotton and abaca clothes, and in pottery.|$|R
60|$|I should {{premise that}} I {{use the term}} Struggle for Existence in a large and metaphorical sense, {{including}} dependence of one being on another, and including (which is more important) not only {{the life of the}} individual, but success in leaving progeny. Two canine animals in a time of dearth, may be truly said to struggle with each other which shall get food and live. But a plant {{on the edge of a}} desert is said to struggle for life against the drought, though more properly it should be said to be dependent on the moisture. A plant which annually produces a thousand seeds, of which on an average only one comes to maturity, may be more truly said to struggle with the plants of the same and other kinds which already clothe the ground. The missletoe is dependent on the apple and a few other trees, but can only in a far-fetched sense be said to struggle with these trees, for if too many of these parasites grow on the same tree, it will languish and die. But several seedling missletoes, growing close together on the same branch, may more truly be said to struggle with each other. As the missletoe is disseminated by birds, its existence depends on birds; and it may metaphorically be said to struggle with <b>other</b> <b>fruit-bearing</b> plants, in order to tempt birds to devour and thus disseminate its seeds rather than those of other plants. In these several senses, which pass into each other, I use for convenience sake the general term of struggle for existence.|$|R
