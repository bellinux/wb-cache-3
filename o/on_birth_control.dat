5|$|In 1967 activist Bill Baird {{was arrested}} for distributing a {{contraceptive}} foam and a condom to a student during a lecture <b>on</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> and abortion at Boston University. Baird's appeal of his conviction resulted in the United States Supreme Court case Eisenstadt v. Baird (1972), which extended the Griswold holding to unmarried couples, and thereby legalized birth control for all Americans.|$|E

5|$|Kim {{solidified}} his {{break with}} cinematic realism by following The Housemaid {{with two more}} films exploring styles and mixing genres, radically new for Korean cinema at the time. The Sea Knows (1961) transcended {{its roots in the}} standard anti-Japanese World War II film to become a distinctive examination of humanity, sadism, greed, lust for power and sexuality. The box-office success of this film enabled Kim to buy his first house, in the Namsan district of Seoul. Goryeojang (1963), dealt with a similar subject matter as The Ballad of Narayama (1983), directed by Shohei Imamura, a filmmaker with whom Kim has often been compared. Kim's version of the story is marked by his mixing of genres. For example, he frames the storywhich deals with an ancient tradition in which elders were abandoned to diewithin a modern lecture <b>on</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E

5|$|Many Western Catholics have voiced {{significant}} {{disagreement with}} the Church's teaching on contraception. Catholics for Choice, a political lobbyist group which is not associated with the Catholic Church, stated in 1998 that 96% of U.S. Catholic women had used contraceptives {{at some point in}} their lives and that 72% of Catholics believed that one could be a good Catholic without obeying the Church's teaching <b>on</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control.</b> Use of natural family planning methods among United States Catholics purportedly is low, although the number cannot be known with certainty. As Catholic health providers are among the largest providers of services to patients with HIV/AIDS worldwide, there is significant controversy within and outside the church regarding the use of condoms as a means of limiting new infections, as condom use ordinarily constitutes prohibited contraceptive use.|$|E

25|$|Many women's clubs were {{involved}} in the birth control movement and promoted sex education. Women's clubs promoted talks from experts <b>on</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control.</b> The Chicago Women's Club helped organize the Illinois Birth Control League, which later set up clinics around Chicago.

25|$|In France, the 1920 Birth Law {{contained}} a clause that criminalized dissemination of birth-control literature. That law, however, was annulled in 1967 by the Neuwirth Law, thus authorizing contraception, which was followed in 1975 with the Veil Law. Women fought for reproductive rights and they helped end the nation's ban <b>on</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> in 1965. In 1994, 5% of French women aged 20 to 49 {{who were at}} risk of unintended pregnancy did not use contraception.|$|E

25|$|Humanae vitae (Latin: Of Human Life) is an {{encyclical}} {{written by}} Pope Paul VI and dated 25 July 1968. The text was issued at a Vatican {{press conference on}} 29 July. Subtitled On the Regulation of Birth, it re-affirmed the orthodox teaching of the Catholic Church regarding married love, responsible parenthood, and the rejection of most forms of artificial contraception. In formulating his teaching he explained why he did not accept the conclusions of the Pontifical Commission <b>on</b> <b>Birth</b> <b>Control</b> established by his predecessor, Pope John XXIII, a commission he himself had expanded.|$|E

A survey conducted in 2015 by the Pew Research Center among 5,122 U.S. adults (including 1,016 self-identified Catholics) stated 76% of U.S. Catholics thought that the church should allow Catholics to use birth control.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 9th to early 10th century, the Persian {{physician}} Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi documented coitus interruptus, preventing ejaculation {{and the use}} of pessaries to block the cervix as birth control methods. He described a number of pessaries, including elephant dung, cabbages and pitch, used alone or in combination. During the same period Ali ibn Abbas al-Majusi documented the use of pessaries made of rock salt for women for whom pregnancy may be dangerous. In the early 10th century the Persian Polymath Abu Ali al-Hussain ibn Abdallah ibn Sina, known in Europe as Avicenna, included a chapter <b>on</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> in his medical encyclopedia The Canon of Medicine, listing 20 different methods of preventing conception.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1920s, Stopes {{and other}} feminist pioneers, {{including}} Dora Russell and Stella Browne, {{played a major}} role in breaking down taboos about sex and increasing knowledge, pleasure and improved reproductive health. Stopes was particularly influential in helping emerging birth control movements in a number of British colonies. In 1930 the National Birth Control Council was formed. Stella Browne's initial activism was limited to giving speaking tour across the country, providing information <b>on</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control,</b> women’s health problems, problems related to puberty and sex education. In 1929 began to openly call for the legalization of abortion, during her lecture in front of the World Sexual Reform Congress in London. In April 1930 the Birth Control Conference assembled 700 delegates and was successful in bringing birth control and abortion into the political sphere - three months later, HM Ministry of Health allowed local authorities to give birth control advice in welfare centres.|$|E
25|$|When he was 37, {{he married}} his 22-year-old backup singer and dancer Mayte Garcia, on Valentine's Day 1996. Mayte Garcia {{wrote in her}} memoir, The Most Beautiful: My Life with Prince that she was 16 when she first met Prince {{backstage}} at a concert in Germany after submitting a tape of her belly dancing. When Garcia turned 17 she moved to Prince's home, Paisley Park and he became her legal guardian. At 19, Prince {{told her it was}} time to go <b>on</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> and took her virginity just one week later. They had a son named Amiir Gregory Nelson on October 16, 1996; he was born with Pfeiffer syndrome and died a week later. In a later interview, she stated that she and Prince also lost a pregnancy early on to a miscarriage in late 1997. The couple eventually divorced in June 2000. Garcia said that all she wanted to take from the union was the urn with their son's ashes. She eventually learned from a friend that Prince had burned everything in their son's nursery, including the boy's crib and the urn with his ashes.|$|E

50|$|Some {{current and}} past issues in European {{demography}} have included religious emigration, ethnic relations, economic immigration, a declining birth rate and an ageing population. In some countries, such as Poland, access to abortion is currently limited and it is entirely illegal in the Mediterranean nation of Malta. In the past, such restrictions and also restrictions <b>on</b> artificial <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> were commonplace throughout Europe.|$|R
25|$|Because the Pill was so effective, {{and soon}} so widespread, it also {{heightened}} {{the debate about}} the moral and health consequences of pre-marital sex and promiscuity. Never before had sexual activity been so divorced from reproduction. For a couple using the Pill, intercourse became purely an expression of love, or a means of physical pleasure, or both; but it was no longer a means of reproduction. While this was true of previous contraceptives, their relatively high failure rates and their less widespread use failed to emphasize this distinction as clearly as did the Pill. The spread of oral contraceptive use thus led many religious figures and institutions to debate the proper role of sexuality and its relationship to procreation. The Roman Catholic Church in particular, after studying the phenomenon of oral contraceptives, re-emphasized the stated teaching <b>on</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> in the 1968 papal encyclical Humanae vitae. The encyclical reiterated the established Catholic teaching that artificial contraception distorts the nature and purpose of sex. On the other side Anglican and other Protestant churches, such as the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) accepted the combined oral contraceptive pill.|$|E
500|$|On July 3, 2014, six justices {{ordered an}} {{injunction}} that allowed Wheaton College of Illinois, a religiously affiliated university, an exemption from complying with Affordable Care Act's mandate on contraception. It {{came in the}} immediate wake of the Court's 5–4 decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, in which the conservative bloc had prevailed, and was opposed by the court's three female members: Sotomayor, Ginsburg and Kagan. [...] They suggested that the Hobby Lobby decision was not the Court's conclusive opinion <b>on</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control.</b> In her dissent to the injunction, Sotomayor wrote that, [...] "Those who are bound by our decisions usually believe they can take us at our word ... Not today." [...] Sotomayor stated further her opinion that the decision compromised [...] "hundreds of Wheaton's employees and students of their legal entitlement to contraceptive coverage." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{graduate}} of the [...] University of Melbourne, where she studied medicine and excelled at sports, Mary qualified as a general practitioner in 1921 and became a resident surgeon at Royal Melbourne Hospital. Her work was mainly with poor women, many of whom lived in unsanitary conditions and had inadequate diets. The social mores of the time often kept young women ignorant of matters dealing with sex and pregnancy. She recognised that pregnant women in particular needed more information {{about what was happening}} to them, and provided information <b>on</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> {{at a time when many}} doctors and a large segment of the community were opposed to it.
