40|$|Introduced as a {{biological}} control agent in North America and middle Europe the Harlequin Ladybird _Harmonia axyridis_ has spread all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>and</b> are capable to become an increasing problem for winegrowers and also households.

During harvests, the beetles feed on grapes and may get crushed with them during processing causing release of hemolymph into the must. The hemolymph of ladybirds contains specific substances which consist mainly of pyrazines like the 3 -isopropyl- 2 -methoxypyrazine.
