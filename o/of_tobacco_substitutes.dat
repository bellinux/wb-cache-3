40|$|Summary. -The topical {{carcinogenicity}} to mouse skin {{of smoke}} condensates ob-tained from a <b>tobacco</b> <b>substitute</b> (NSM), {{alone or in}} combination with tobacco, has been compared with condensate from tobacco and with acetone, the solvent used. Sixteen different types of cigarette were {{used to make the}} condensates, and the age-standardized results have been analysed according to the Weibull distribution model. The results show that NSM condensate has less than 25 % of the potency <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> condensate (37 0 at 95 0 upper confidence limit), and that condensates from blends <b>of</b> NSM and <b>tobacco</b> are similarly reduced in activity. General pathology analysis failed to reveal abnormalities due to NSM. THE chemical complexity of cigarette smoke precludes the precise attribution of the known carcinogenic effects to a single component or group of components, and animal models are therefore required to assay carcinogenic activity. A model commonly used is the topical application of smoke condensates to mouse skin, and measurement of the incidence of tumours which result. The method has been much used to monitor attempts at reduction of the carcinogenicity <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> smoke, and although there is as yet no evidence equating mouse skin response with the human lung response, it is assumed that a direct relationship exists between the ability to induce tumours in mouse skin and in the human bronchial tract. The experiments described were de-signed to determine the carcinogenic potential of smoke condensate from a substitute smoking material and from blends of this material with conventional tobacco.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tobacco use in India is {{characterized}} by a high prevalence of smoking and smokeless tobacco use, with dual use also contributing a noticeable proportion. In the context of such a high burden <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> use, this study examines the regional variations, and socioeconomic, demographic and other correlates <b>of</b> smoking, smokeless <b>tobacco</b> and dual use <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> in India. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed a cross sectional, nationally representative sample of individuals from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey in India (2009 - 10), which covered 69, 296 individuals aged 15 years and above. The current tobacco use in three forms, namely, smoking only, smokeless tobacco use only, and both smoking and smokeless tobacco use were considered as outcomes in this study. Descriptive statistics, cross tabulations and multinomial logistic regression analysis were adopted as analytical tools. Smokeless tobacco use was the major form <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> use in India followed by smoking and dual tobacco use. Tobacco use was higher among males, the less educated, the poor, and the rural population in India. Respondents lacking knowledge of health hazards <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> had higher prevalence <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> use in each form. The prevalence of different forms <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> use varies significantly by states. The prevalence <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> use increases concomitantly with age among females. Middle-aged adult males had higher prevalence <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> use. Age, education and region were found to be significant determinants of all forms <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> use. Adults from the poor household had significantly higher risk <b>of</b> consuming smokeless <b>tobacco.</b> Lack <b>of</b> awareness about the selected hazards <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> significantly affects tobacco use. CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need to curb the use <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> among the sub-groups of population with higher prevalence. Tobacco control policies in India should adopt a targeted, population-based approach to control and reduce tobacco consumption in the country...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} smoking {{cigarettes}} with 30 % <b>of</b> the <b>tobacco</b> replaced by NSM <b>tobacco</b> <b>substitute,</b> which lowered their tar and nicotine delivery, were studied by comparing {{them with the}} effects of conventional cigarettes in a controlled crossover trial lasting 20 months.

The test cigarettes were acceptable to {{all but one of the}} men. In a subsample of 35 men estimates of nicotine intake were obtained from monthly analyses of cigarette stubs. On changing from NSM to control cigarettes six of the 17 men, who were accustomed to low nicotine, kept their nicotine intake down by some change in smoking habit. Before the crossover and this change in smoking habit the men smoking NSM cigarettes had a small but significant reduction of cough. Cigarettes containing 30 % NSM and delivering only 1 mg of nicotine are likely to be acceptable to smokers and may reduce coughing.
