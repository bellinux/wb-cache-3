5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} sales <b>of</b> <b>hybrid</b> electric vehicles in several countries, {{some members of the}} blind community have raised concerns about the noise reduction when those vehicles operate in all-electric mode, as blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets and feel quiet hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard. Although a 2009 study found no statistically significant difference in pedestrian crashes involving quiet hybrid vehicles when compared to noisier vehicles when both types of vehicles were travelling in a straight line, it found a doubling <b>of</b> <b>hybrid</b> vehicle pedestrian crashes when reversing or parking etc. at slow speeds.|$|E

40|$|Where {{does the}} study <b>of</b> <b>hybrids</b> stand at present? Through {{a review of}} {{existing}} research, this paper provides a number of contributions to the literature on inter-organizational relations, or hybrids. For one, basing ourselves on the traditional theories used in the study <b>of</b> <b>hybrids,</b> we propose an integrative definition and classification <b>of</b> <b>hybrids.</b> We classify explanations of the formation, functioning and implications <b>of</b> <b>hybrids</b> using agency theory, property rights theory, transaction cost economics and the resource-based view. For another, based on a review of recent qualitative studies on hybrids, we extend our classification to include the more recent theories used in the study <b>of</b> <b>hybrids.</b> These recent studies combine the traditional theories on hybrids with network and evolutionary theories, and literature on strategy and trust. Our review also provides new insights on the dynamics and environment <b>of</b> <b>hybrids,</b> and suggests avenues for future research...|$|R

5|$|All North American Drosera species {{except for}} D. anglica have a {{chromosome}} count of 2n=20. In 1955, Wood noted that D. anglica had a chromosome count of 2n=40, and hypothesized {{that it was}} <b>of</b> <b>hybrid</b> amphidiploid origin. Since the leaf morphology of D. anglica is an intermediary between that of D. rotundifolia and D. linearis and the two occur sympatrically in several locations, Wood conjectured that D. anglica likely originated from a hybrid between these two.|$|E

5|$|Crossbred cows produce up to, and in {{some cases}} in excess of, 20% more weaned calf weight as a result of {{increased}} reproductive performance and maternal ability. Crossbred cow longevity is also increased by up to two years when compared with straightbred cows. However, the benefits <b>of</b> <b>hybrid</b> vigour in a crossbred cow decline in subsequent generations if progeny are mated to cattle of parentage similar to the cow, and increase if a new breed is introduced. Although studies acknowledge that the major production benefits <b>of</b> <b>hybrid</b> vigour occur in crossbred cow herds, the main use of Limousins outside of Europe continues to be as terminal sires in purebred British breed cow herds.|$|E

5|$|PEV is a {{subcategory}} {{of electric}} vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions <b>of</b> <b>hybrid</b> electric vehicles and conventional {{internal combustion engine}} vehicles.

5|$|A third form of progeny {{arises when}} F1 hybrids are bred with animals genetically {{dissimilar}} to their parents.

Maintenance of heterozygosity {{is the key to}} maintaining the highest levels <b>of</b> <b>hybrid</b> vigour. This requires complex breeding programmes and high levels of management. Simplified crossbreeding programmes have been developed using hybrid or composite bulls, which was the motivation behind the development of Lim-Flex hybrids.|$|E

5|$|Biotechnology in {{the general}} sense has been an {{important}} part of biology since the late 19th century. With the industrialization of brewing and agriculture, chemists and biologists became aware of the great potential of human-controlled biological processes. In particular, fermentation proved a great boon to chemical industries. By the early 1970s, a wide range of biotechnologies were being developed, from drugs like penicillin and steroids to foods like Chlorella and single-cell protein to gasohol—as well as a wide range <b>of</b> <b>hybrid</b> high-yield crops and agricultural technologies, the basis for the Green Revolution.|$|E

During this time, Linkin Park reunited with their original bassist, Dave “Phoenix” Farrell. The band kept an online journal on their official website throughout their 2001 and 2002 touring regime, in which each band member made a respective notation. Although the notes are no longer on their website, they are available on fansites. Linkin Park played 324 shows in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{transfer}} between species {{includes the}} formation <b>of</b> <b>hybrid</b> organisms and horizontal gene transfer. Horizontal gene transfer is {{the transfer of}} genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring; this is most common among bacteria. In medicine, this contributes {{to the spread of}} antibiotic resistance, as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species. Horizontal transfer of genes from bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the adzuki bean weevil Callosobruchus chinensis has occurred. An example of larger-scale transfers are the eukaryotic bdelloid rotifers, which have received a range of genes from bacteria, fungi and plants. Viruses can also carry DNA between organisms, allowing transfer of genes even across biological domains.|$|E

5|$|Loss <b>of</b> <b>hybrid</b> vigour occurs and {{phenotype}} varies {{greatly in}} subsequent generations if F1 hybrids are inter-bred or backcrossed with animals genetically {{similar to the}} F1 parent. Inter-bred F1 hybrids will produce progeny that can be either heterozygous for each gene variant, homozygous for one gene variant, or homozygous for the other gene variant. When one of the variants has a large effect on a trait, for example the effect of myostatin variants on muscularity, larger phenotypic variation will occur among the progeny. Backcross progeny will have less phenotypic variation and comprise animals that are either heterozygous for each gene variant or homozygous for the variant found in the original F1 backcross parent.|$|E
5|$|Species are reproductively {{isolated}} {{by strong}} barriers to hybridisation, which include morphological differences, differing times of fertility, mating behaviors and cues, and physiological rejection of sperm cells or the developing embryo. Some act before fertilization and others after it. Similar barriers exist in plants, with differences in flowering times, pollen vectors, inhibition of pollen tube growth, somatoplastic sterility, cytoplasmic-genic male sterility {{and the structure}} of the chromosomes. A few animal species and many plant species, however, are the result <b>of</b> <b>hybrid</b> speciation, including important crop plants such as wheat, where the number of chromosomes has been doubled.|$|E

With the exception of the South African species A. striata, these Aloe species are native to Socotra (Yemen), Somalia, and Sudan.
