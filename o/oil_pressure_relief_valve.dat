The research in this paper shows that the proportion of soft seat spring operated <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valves</b> failing is the same or less than that of hard seat valves, and that for failed valves, soft seat valves typically have failure ratios of proof test pressure to set pressure less than that of hard seat valves...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- <b>Pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} devices used on the security of pipelines, since it is responsible to guarantee the integrity of the installations. Generally, the response and behavior of a <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> during its transient is unknown by users, who employ simplified and static analysis to design the pipeline, further, the information provided by manufactures is limited. The flow-pressure, displacement-time and pressure –time relationships are an important external characteristic of the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> and the hydraulic circuit. So, many engineers have been put an effort on this topic for its significant impact on the overall hydraulic system. Most of them are focused on the influences of the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valves,</b> their selections and applications. It is very important to select, size, locate properly and maintain the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> systems to prevent or minimize the losses from major incidents. Detail of selection and sizing of <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> is shown the following sections of this study. In order to help the circuit operators, a few flow charts are also included. <b>Pressure</b> <b>relief</b> system is used to protect piping and equipment against excessive overpressure for equipment and personnel safety...|$|R

40|$|Spring related <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valves,</b> {{mounted at}} ambient temperature, are {{state of the}} art to protect {{cryogenic}} apparatuses and installations against excessive pressure. However experiences shows limitations in applications on cryogenic pressure vessels: Set pressure varies in a wide range, unauthorized increase of set pressure, seat not tight etc. Alternatively, in some applications, spring related <b>relief</b> <b>valves</b> with cold seating, so called “Quench Relief Valves” (QRV) are used. Beside their relief function further functionalities like tight seating for system isolation as well as shut-off function for bypass precooling may be requested. So QRV’s shall be used in parallel to a cold or warm bursts disc at higher set pressure because of its rules non-conformity. There are also <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valves</b> with warm seat available on which the set pressure is based on an adjustment of forces by permanent magnets.

Valve and its switching and control components used for such a smart relief design should fulfil similar reliability requests to qualify for use in SIL 3 applications.

Mechanical design and function of such <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valves</b> will be shown and discussed considering its limitations regarding applications of pressure vessel rules...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The {{function}} of a <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> is to protect pressure vessels, piping systems, and other equipment from pressures exceeding their design pressure {{by more than a}} fixed predetermined amount.

It is not the purpose of a <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> to control or regulate the pressure in the vessel or system that the valve protects, and it does not take the place of a control or regulating valve. The aim of safety systems in processing plants is to prevent damage to equipment, avoid injury to personnel and to eliminate any risks of compromising the welfare of the community at large and the environment.

50|$|The {{emergency}} <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> in {{the tank}} is called a hydrostatic <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valve.</b> It is designed to open if the pressure {{in the tank}} is dangerously high, thus releasing some vapour to the atmosphere to reduce the pressure in the tank. The release of a small quantity of vapour reduces the pressure in the tank, which causes some of the liquid in the tank to vaporise to re-establish equilibrium between liquid and vapour. The latent heat of vaporisation causes the tank to cool, which reduces pressure even further.|$|R
