5|$|In July 1452, Grubiša {{sought for}} his family and all {{residents}} of Krajina to become Venetian vassals. Venice accepted the request, confirmed their old customs, allowed the foundation of fort and port in Makar, and forgave older violence. Thus, the Kačićs and residents of Krajina fought at their <b>own</b> <b>expense</b> between Neretva and Cetina rivers, and gave taxes to Venice.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Agrippa in 12BC, a {{solution}} had {{to be found in}} maintaining Rome's water supply system. This came about because it was overseen by Agrippa when he served as aedile, and was even funded by him afterwards when he was a private citizen paying at his <b>own</b> <b>expense.</b> In that year, Augustus arranged a system where the Senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply and to ensure that Rome's aqueducts did not fall into disrepair.|$|E

5|$|Calvin's first {{published}} work was a commentary of Seneca the Younger's De Clementia. Published at his <b>own</b> <b>expense</b> in 1532, {{it showed that}} he was a humanist in the tradition of Erasmus with a thorough understanding of classical scholarship. His first theological work, the Psychopannychia, attempted to refute the doctrine of soul sleep as promulgated by the Anabaptists. Calvin probably wrote it during the period following Cop's speech, but it was not published until 1542 in Strasbourg.|$|E
5|$|In the English Civil War, Thomas Bushell held Lundy for King Charles I, {{rebuilding}} Marisco Castle and garrisoning {{the island}} at his <b>own</b> <b>expense.</b> He {{was a friend}} of Francis Bacon, a strong supporter of the Royalist cause and an expert on mining and coining. It was the last Royalist territory held {{between the first and second}} civil wars. After receiving permission from Charles I, Bushell surrendered the island on 24 February 1647 to Richard Fiennes, representing General Fairfax. In 1656, the island was acquired by Lord Saye and Sele.|$|E
5|$|Initially Göth's {{plan was}} that all the factories, {{including}} Schindler's, should be moved inside the camp gates. However, Schindler, {{with a combination of}} diplomacy, flattery, and bribery, not only prevented his factory from being moved, but convinced Göth to allow him to build (at his <b>own</b> <b>expense)</b> a subcamp at Emalia to house his workers plus 450 Jews from other nearby factories. There they were safe from the threat of random execution, were well fed and housed, and were even permitted to undertake religious observances.|$|E

5|$|Morris had {{continued}} to devote much time to writing poetry. In 1867 Bell and Dandy published Morris's epic poem, The Life and Death of Jason, at his <b>own</b> <b>expense.</b> The book was a retelling of the ancient Greek myth of the hero Jason and his quest to find the Golden Fleece. In contrast to Morris's former publication, The Life and Death of Jason was well received, resulting in the publishers paying Morris a fee for the second edition.|$|E
5|$|Sonnabend {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{physicians}} to notice among his gay male patients the immune deficiency that would later be named AIDS. His background in microbiology, virology, infectious diseases and prior experience of working with immunocompromised transplant patients helped him to conduct some of the earliest research into AIDS, independently of government agencies that were slow to react and often at his <b>own</b> <b>expense,</b> and in 1983 he was founding editor one of the first AIDS journals, AIDS Research (renamed AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses in 1986, after Sonnabend was fired from the journal).|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Kingdom of Bosnia into the Ottoman hands in 1463, the {{southern}} and central parts of the Kingdom of Croatia remained unprotected, the defense of which was left to Croatian gentry who kept smaller troops in the fortified border areas at their <b>own</b> <b>expense.</b> Decisive Ottoman victory at the Battle of Krbava field in 1493, shook all of Croatia. However, it did not dissuade the Croats from making more decisive and persistent attempts at defending themselves against the attacks of the much larger enemy. A new wave of Ottoman conquest began in 1521, after which a good portion of Croatia was conquered or pillaged.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Grinsell became a Pilot Officer in the Air Photographic Branch of the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1941. During he conflict, he was stationed in Egypt, where he spent time studying the archaeological remains of Ancient Egypt and visiting all of the pyramids near to Cairo. Based on these experiences, at his <b>own</b> <b>expense</b> he published Egyptian Pyramids in 1947. Designed as a guide to the sites, it was (as Grinsell acknowledged) heavily reliant on the earlier plans of Egyptologists but with additional aerial photographs that Grinsell had obtained through his involvement with the RAF. The book was largely ignored by Britain's Egyptological establishment.|$|E
5|$|Conwy Castle {{fell into}} {{disrepair}} {{again by the}} early 17th century. Charles I sold it to Edward Conway in 1627 for £100, and Edward's son, also called Edward, inherited the ruin in 1631. In 1642 the English Civil War broke out between the Charles' royalist supporters and Parliament. John Williams, the Archbishop of York, {{took charge of the}} castle on behalf of the king, and set about repairing and garrisoning it at his <b>own</b> <b>expense.</b> In 1645, Sir John Owen was appointed governor of the castle instead, however, leading to a bitter dispute between the two men. The Archbishop defected to Parliament, the town of Conwy fell in August 1646 and in November General Thomas Mytton finally took the castle itself after a substantial siege.|$|E
5|$|Despite this protest, {{two sets}} of {{illustrations}} for Candide were produced by the French artist Jean-Michel Moreau le Jeune. The first version was done, at Moreau's <b>own</b> <b>expense,</b> in 1787 and included in Kehl's publication of that year, Oeuvres Complètes de Voltaire. Four images were drawn by Moreau for this edition and were engraved by Pierre-Charles Baquoy. The second version, in 1803, consisted of seven drawings by Moreau which were transposed by multiple engravers. The twentieth-century modern artist Paul Klee stated that it was while reading Candide that he discovered his own artistic style. Klee illustrated the work, and his drawings were published in a 1920 version edited by Kurt Wolff.|$|E

5|$|In 1623, Kepler at last {{completed}} the Rudolphine Tables, {{which at the}} time was considered his major work. However, due to the publishing requirements of the emperor and negotiations with Tycho Brahe's heir, it would not be printed until 1627. In the meantime, religious tension — the root of the ongoing Thirty Years' War — once again put Kepler and his family in jeopardy. In 1625, agents of the Catholic Counter-Reformation placed most of Kepler's library under seal, and in 1626 the city of Linz was besieged. Kepler moved to Ulm, where he arranged for the printing of the Tables at his <b>own</b> <b>expense.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Potter revised a {{tale about}} a rabbit named Peter {{she had written}} for a child in 1893, and {{prepared}} a dummy book of it in imitation of Helen Bannerman's 1889 best-seller The Story of Little Black Sambo. Unable to find a buyer, she published the book {{for family and friends}} at her <b>own</b> <b>expense</b> in December 1901. Frederick Warne & Co. had earlier rejected the tale, but, anxious to compete in the booming small format children's book market, reconsidered and accepted it following the recommendation of their prominent children's book artist L. Leslie Brooke. Potter agreed to colour the pen and ink illustrations of the private edition, and chose the then-new Hentschel three-colour process for reproducing her watercolours. On 2 October 1902 The Tale of Peter Rabbit was released.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, {{with the}} option of nuclear weapons {{discarded}} {{and the likelihood of}} operations beyond the Swiss border severely restricted, the Federal Military Department (EMD) decided that the next generation of aircraft acquired by the Swiss Air Force would be for close air support.

5|$|In {{the early}} days of Dunedin, it was {{impossible}} for a dray to reach the Caversham Valley in wet weather unless it went by a circuitous route around the hills. Valpy solved this problem by hiring men at his <b>own</b> <b>expense</b> to build a crude road from the southern end of Princes Street to his farm at Forbury. This formed the basis for later roads into the suburb. The road curved {{around the edge of the}} hills at the Glen to avoid a large swamp, the site of which is currently occupied by Carisbrook sports ground.|$|E
5|$|Johnson left Washington, D.C. {{just before}} Congress adjourned. He raised one {{thousand}} men, nominally {{part of the}} militia brigade under Kentucky Governor Isaac Shelby, but largely operating independently. He disciplined his men, required that every man have arms in prime condition and ready to hand, and hired gunsmiths, blacksmiths, and doctors at his <b>own</b> <b>expense.</b> He devised a new tactical system: when any group of men encountered the enemy, they were to dismount, take cover, and hold the enemy in place. All groups not in contact were to ride {{to the sound of}} firing, and dismount, surrounding the enemy when they got there. Between May and September, Johnson raided throughout the Northwest, burning the war supply centers of Indian villages, surrounding Indian fighting units and scattering them, killing some Indian warriors each time.|$|E
5|$|Keen {{to follow}} up his {{interest}} in aviation, Johnson started taking flying lessons at his <b>own</b> <b>expense.</b> He applied to join the Auxiliary Air Force (AAF) but encountered some of the social problems that were rife in British society at the time. Johnson strongly felt he was rejected {{on the grounds of}} his class status. Johnson's fortunes were to improve. As the chances of war increased {{in the aftermath of the}} Munich Crisis, the standards of the RAF were relaxed, however, as the service expanded and brought in men from ordinary social backgrounds. Johnson re-applied to the AAF. He was informed that sufficient pilots were already available but there were some vacancies in the balloon squadrons. Johnson rejected the offer.|$|E
