500|$|Daniel Simpson Day – Landis {{remarks in}} a voiceover that D-Day {{has been the}} hardest to track down for the documentary, saying that rumors have flown around, with his {{whereabouts}} ranging from a Buddhist monastery in Nepal to the Yukon Territory. Landis eventually approaches a house in Modesto, California, where a man opens the door by a crack and claims, in a Hispanic accent, [...] "I don't know no D-Day person! I don't know him!" [...] He slams the door in Landis' face and then bursts <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> in a car. He pulls {{out onto the street}} to the strains of the William Tell Overture, gives a manic laugh exactly like D-Day's, and speeds off.|$|E
500|$|<b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> revival, a more {{aggressive}} form of garage rock known as garage punk emerged in the late 1980s. [...] It differed from the [...] "retro" [...] revival in that its acts {{did not attempt to}} replicate the exact look and sound of 1960s groups, and their approach tended to be louder, often infusing garage rock with elements of Stooges-era protopunk, 1970s punk rock, and other influences, creating a new hybrid. [...] Several notable garage punk bands were the Gories, thee Mighty Caesars, the Mummies and thee Headcoats. [...] Garage punk and revival acts persisted into the 1990s and the new millennium, with independent record labels releasing records by bands playing fast-paced, lo-fi music. [...] Some of the more prolific independent labels include Estrus, Get Hip, Bomp!, and Sympathy for the Record Industry.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler, who had previously directed Rihanna videos for [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] and [...] "Shut Up and Drive". The video was shot in Venice, Los Angeles on April 3, 2008. The video begins with Rihanna {{standing in front of}} a black backdrop for the opening of the song. As the first verse starts, the scene is intercut with another of Rihanna looking out the window at her boyfriend and standing behind the front door as he approaches and asks to come in. As Rihanna walks way from the door singing the lyrics [...] "Don't tell me you're sorry cos you're not", the viewer realizes that her boyfriend has perhaps done something wrong and been unfaithful. During the first chorus and second verse, Rihanna is shown in a different outfit, this time sitting in a silver Porsche in a garage. As Rihanna pulls <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> and onto the street, her ex-boyfriend walks alongside the car as she drives and begs her to forgive him; she pulls away. For the bridge, Rihanna is shown sitting on a bed as well as in front of the black backdrops as she reads a text message from her ex-boyfriend, who asks to meet her. During the last chorus, Rihanna appears in a different outfit and walks into a lounge, where she puts some clothes on a table and then sits on a sofa. As her ex-boyfriend walks in, the singer gets up and walks over to the clothes, where she withdraws some matches and strikes one, dropping it on what is made aware to be some of her ex-boyfriend's clothes. As the song comes to and end, Rihanna walks out of the room whilst he tries to put out the fire.|$|E
5000|$|The {{telephone}} {{was connected}} in 1907, and by 1949 the Toodyay (telephone) Exchange serviced about 120 local connections. At {{this time the}} staff comprised three postal assistants and four telephonists. Nine mails were despatched weekly to Perth and ten were received via a taxi service ("Miss Toodyay" [...] operating <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Toodyay <b>Garage)</b> or by rail.|$|R
25|$|Acid rock is a loosely defined type of {{rock music}} that evolved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mid-1960s <b>garage</b> punk {{movement}} and helped launch the psychedelic subculture. The style is generally defined by heavy, distorted guitars, lyrics with drug references, and long improvised jams. Distinguishing acid rock from other genres can be tenuous, as much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> style overlaps with 1960s punk, proto-metal, and heavy, blues-based hard rock.|$|R
50|$|Weider {{was born}} in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to Louis and Anna Weider, Polish-Jewish {{immigrants}} from <b>the</b> town <b>of</b> Kurów, Poland. He published <b>the</b> first issue <b>of</b> Your Physique magazine {{as a teenager in}} 1940, and built a set <b>of</b> barbells <b>out</b> <b>of</b> car wheels and axles <b>the</b> same year <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family <b>garage</b> on Coloniale Street in Montreal. He designed numerous training courses beginning in the 1950s, including <b>the</b> Weider System <b>of</b> Bodybuilding.|$|R
2500|$|Myles, Smart, and Alton {{constructed}} a reservoir {{in one of}} the shelves in Smart's cell, and Alton regularly filled that space with gasoline he smuggled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage.</b> [...] The trio waited until they had filled the container before enacting their plans.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next week}} at the STP 500, on lap 43, Busch {{collided}} with [...] Brad Keselowski on pit road during a caution, causing massive damage to Keselowski's car. There would be several instances of beating and banging between the two drivers after Keselowski's car was repaired and came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage.</b> By {{the end of the}} race, Busch was battling Jimmie Johnson for the lead in the final 27 laps. Busch took the lead with 11 laps remaining, and kept it to win his first race since 2011, and first at Martinsville since 2002.|$|E
2500|$|The Scotiabank Saddledome {{was one of}} many {{buildings}} impacted by the 2013 Alberta floods. [...] The flooding of the Elbow and Bow Rivers swamped many areas of the city, including Stampede Park where the Saddledome is located. [...] The event level of the arena was reported to be filled with water up to the 10th row of seating and the dressing rooms and control room for the video replay screen were under water. At a press conference held on June 22, 2013, team president Ken King stated that the arena had flooded up to the eighth row and that the event level of the facility was a [...] "total loss." [...] He added that the team's equipment and some memorabilia had also been destroyed, but expressed confidence that the facility would be repaired and ready in time for the October start to the season. Prospect Ben Hanowski was among the 100,000 people forced to evacuate by the floods. He described the situation as [...] "almost terrifying," [...] but praised the city's community spirit in the disaster: [...] "I didn’t know how I was going to get [...] I didn’t know if I could get a rental car <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> and through some water to get up here, and I had a person come up to me right away and ask if I had a place to go and if I had a way to get there and basically offered me a ride somewhere. I’d never met the person before. I think that example, right there, kind of speaks to what the city of Calgary is all about." ...|$|E
50|$|MEND {{was founded}} in 1971 {{by a group of}} volunteers led by Ed and Carolyn Rose. Working <b>out</b> <b>of</b> three <b>garages,</b> <b>the</b> volunteers {{collected}} food, clothing, and furniture for needy families in the area. It was incorporated as a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization in 1976.|$|R
50|$|In November 2009, Anna Bond and {{her husband}} Nathan, founded Rifle Paper Co. The company {{initially}} started as an online store based <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> couple's <b>garage</b> apartment while Bond created illustrated wedding invitations. Anthropologie became Rifle Paper Co.'s first account. Rifle Paper Co. released cocktail-themed coasters in July 2012. The company designed phone cases for the Apple iPhone in April 2013.

50|$|In another subplot, Ben (Adam Scott) and April (Aubrey Plaza) {{decide to}} make a {{surprise}} trip to Pawnee. However, {{they are unable to}} get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parking <b>garage</b> due to <b>the</b> presidential motorcade being nearby and security not letting any cars near the area. Ben and April remain in the car for hours and grow increasingly annoyed with each other. When the motorcade finally departs the area, Ben's car runs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> gas. They push it back into the parking spot and end up laughing about the experience, with Ben offering to pay for plane tickets to Pawnee the next weekend.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{put on the}} chains," [...] {{cried the}} chauffeur, and brought out the anti-skidding chains for the rear wheels. The boys got the colored man to assist him, and the chains were soon adjusted. Then the car was backed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> and the three Rovers leaped inside.|$|E
6000|$|This {{morning he}} was darkly {{prepared}} to find something wrong, and he felt belittled when the mixture exploded sweet and strong, and the car didn't even brush the door-jamb, gouged and splintery with many bruisings by fenders, as he backed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage.</b> He was confused. He shouted [...] "Morning!" [...] to Sam Doppelbrau with more cordiality than he had intended.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{came back}} and passing close enough to touch Foster, went up the steps and through a door. Foster put down the lamp and strolled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage.</b> He found dinner ready at his hotel and when he had {{finished}} went to the smoking-room, which was opposite the office. He left the door open and by and by heard a man enter the hall and stop at the counter.|$|E
5000|$|Charlie Wright's (Aidan Quinn) {{business}} empire {{is revealed}} to be a Ponzi scheme, having taken as much as eleven billion from his clients. Leaving his office after hearing about his punishment, Wright is intercepted by FBI Agent Hobbs (Mario Van Peebles), who is unable to arrest Wright as at the moment {{there is not a}} warrant. Stalling time, Hobbs gets his warrant and Hobbs' partner Jimmy (Jordan Belfi) intercepts Wright as he pulls <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> office <b>garage.</b> Looking inside <b>the</b> car, Hobbs is dismayed to find that Wright is gone. The ensuing investigation leaves few clues as to where Wright fled.|$|R
50|$|The Contemporary Art collection, {{housed in}} <b>the</b> {{galleries}} created <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> estate’s original <b>garage</b> and stables, is small but of high quality, including paintings by Larry Rivers, Andy Warhol, Robert Ryman, Red Grooms, and Marylyn Dintenfass.

50|$|After safely {{taking the}} President to <b>the</b> parking <b>garage,</b> Tanner checks {{up on him}} {{to see if he}} is okay. McKenzie, along with other police officers, enters <b>the</b> parking <b>garage</b> and congratulates Tanner on his {{outstanding}} work. He informs Tanner that Castaldi, Don Hancock and the FBI leak are behind bars, and offers Tanner his badge back. However, Tanner is infuriated that the FBI and police could be involved in the job, corrupted by bribes. He refuses to take his badge back and starts walking <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parking <b>garage,</b> with McKenzie yelling at Tanner that this is his last chance. Tanner ignores him completely and leaves.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did," [...] and Tom {{grinned at}} his younger brother. [...] "I {{took it for}} granted that you would make the trip." [...] And thus speaking, Tom leaped into the driver's seat of the new touring car. Then Sam took his place beside his brother, and in a moment more the car was gliding <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage,</b> and down the curving, gravel path leading to the highway running from Ashton past Brill College to Hope Seminary.|$|E
60|$|Lawrence {{had done}} wrong, but {{had paid for}} it and made good in Canada, and now the rogue who had learned his secret would drag him down, or, {{as the price of}} silence, bring his {{relatives}} to poverty. Foster felt that Daly was not the man to be merciful when there was an advantage to be got; one saw a sinister hint of cruelty in his coarsely-handsome face. It would have been a relief to provoke the fellow and throw him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage,</b> but Foster knew he must deny himself this satisfaction, since it would make things worse for those he meant to shield. He did not remember having felt so full of primitive savageness before, but he exercised his self-control.|$|E
60|$|He {{drove his}} Teal bug <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage.</b> At thirty-two minutes after twelve {{he was in}} his room, packing his wicker {{suitcase}} by the method of throwing things in and stamping on the case till it closed. In it he had absolutely all of his toilet refinements and wardrobe except the important portion already in use. They consisted, according to faithful detailed report, of four extra pairs of thick yellow and white cotton socks; two shirts, five collars, five handkerchiefs; a pair of surprisingly vain dancing pumps; high tan laced boots; three suits of cheap cotton underclothes; his Sunday suit, which was dead black in color, and unimaginative in cut; four ties; a fagged toothbrush, a comb and hairbrush, a razor, a strop, shaving soap in a mug; a not very clean towel; and nothing else whatever.|$|E
5000|$|Locking {{herself in}} a bedroom, Sara begs for Deckard to help her. The other party goers realize that the deaths have not been staged. With Deckard {{messaging}} her Myers' location, Sara escapes and is found by Freddie. Myers finds and attacks them. Freddie is injured and Sara makes {{her way to the}} tunnels. She finds an exit near Donna's body and emerges in <b>the</b> <b>garage,</b> where Myers finds her and starts an electrical fire in <b>the</b> <b>garage.</b> Freddie returns and begins fighting Myers hand-to-hand. When he is overpowered, Freddie instead electrocutes Myers, tangling him up in electrical wiring before carrying Sara <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> burning <b>garage.</b> <b>The</b> Myers house burns to the ground.|$|R
50|$|The Northern Virginia Anime Association first {{organized}} the convention. Anime USA {{moved from the}} Sheraton Premiere in Tyson's Corner to the Hyatt Regency Crystal City in 2007, a location previously used by Katsucon and Otakon, due to the conventions growth. Renovations and the Hyatt Regency Crystal City layout caused problems during the 2008 convention. In 2010, the video games room was located in a sectioned off part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parking <b>garage,</b> with at times a cap of 45 people, due to crowding and fire marshal concerns. In 2011 the video game room had to moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parking <b>garage</b> due to concerns from the fire marshal, causing board gaming to be cancelled. For 2012, Anime USA moved to the Washington Marriott Wardman Park in Washington, D.C.|$|R
50|$|DJ Slimzee co-founded Rinse FM in 1994. For {{a three-year}} period in <b>the</b> early days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station the Rinse studio was hosted in DJ Slimzee's house.

60|$|Foster {{thought the}} other waiter {{would have turned}} on more lights if he {{expected}} a customer, and as {{there was no need}} for hurry ate a good meal. Day was breaking when he finished and word was brought him that his car was ready. Going to the office, he paid his bill and asked if a letter or telegram had arrived. There was nothing for him and he went to a window that commanded a view of the street. His car stood close by with Pete inside, but it was some time before Daly's came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage.</b> Knowing that he could reach the door in a few moments, Foster waited until the two ladies who had arrived with Daly went down the steps alone. He could not understand this, but a waiter came up and said that Miss Huntley would like to see him. When Foster reached the pavement the girl had got into the car.|$|E

5000|$|TPG was an [...] "environmental theatre" [...] - {{meaning that}} each {{production}} {{took place in}} an entirely redesigned space. Most of TPG's productions were directed by Schechner, though others including Joan MacIntosh, Stephen Borst, James Griffiths, Leeny Sack, Elizabeth LeCompte, and Spalding Gray either directed their own works or works by others. TPG's designers included Jerry Rojo, Michael Kirby, and Jim Clayburgh. Some of TPG's productions were collages of various texts, other productions were radical deconstructions of classics, and some works were brand new. Schechner resigned as artistic director in 1980. At that time, Elizabeth LeCompte became <b>the</b> artistic director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company which was renamed The Wooster Group and continued to operate <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Performing <b>Garage.</b>|$|R

50|$|Breen {{cracks and}} makes a run for it, {{escaping}} the office in a private elevator. Stottlemeyer curses, knowing that if Breen manages to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building he will disappear forever. However, Monk has a plan. As Breen is about to drive <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parking <b>garage,</b> Monk grabs two bowls of clam chowder from the lobby restaurant and throws them at Breen’s windshield, blinding him, and causing him to lose control and crash. Breen, severely injured, and having lost several of his teeth in <b>the</b> crash, stumbles <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his car carrying a gun, wanting {{nothing more than to}} kill Monk before he goes to prison. Before Breen can pull the trigger, Randy suddenly appears and shoots <b>the</b> gun <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his hand. When Stottlemeyer and Natalie arrive downstairs, Randy tells them that he followed them because he thought they would need backup, though Stottlemeyer points out to him that he also violated a direct order.|$|R
60|$|Dr. Renard was a mild {{man with}} monstrous wealth; his rooms {{were like the}} Musee de Cluny, and he had three motor-cars. These, however, he seemed to use very sparingly, having <b>the</b> simple tastes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French middle class, and when his {{impatient}} friends came to examine them, it took them some time to assure themselves {{that one of them}} even could be made to work. This with some difficulty they brought round into the street before the Doctor's house. When they came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dim <b>garage</b> they were startled to find that twilight had already fallen with <b>the</b> abruptness <b>of</b> night in <b>the</b> tropics. Either they had been longer in the place than they imagined, or some unusual canopy of cloud had gathered over the town. They looked down the steep streets, and seemed to see a slight mist coming up from the sea.|$|R
2500|$|In December 1997, Drive-Thru {{released}} Riverfenix's thirteen-track full-length debut Riverfenix, {{produced by}} Jim Barnes. Within the following year, the album managed {{to sell out}} its first three print runs of 5,000 copies each, which was quite an achievement for an independent record label operating <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> owners' <b>garage.</b> <b>The</b> CD's lyrics and melodies caught <b>the</b> attention <b>of</b> Blink-182's Mark Hoppus, whose sister {{was at that time}} dating Riverfenix's DeLaPaz. Hoppus offered the band an opening slot on an upcoming Blink-182 tour, and eventually became their manager. However, due to <b>the</b> schedule <b>of</b> his own band and <b>the</b> popularity <b>of</b> Blink-182's 1999 album Enema <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State, Hoppus passed managing duties onto Blink-182 manager Rick DeVoe.
