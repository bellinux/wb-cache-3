5|$|Specific {{genes that}} have been linked with MS include {{differences}} in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system—a group of genes on chromosome 6 {{that serves as the}} major histocompatibility complex (MHC). That changes in the HLA region are related to susceptibility has been known since the 1980s, and additionally this same region has been implicated in the development of other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes type I and systemic lupus erythematosus. The most consistent finding is the association between multiple sclerosis and alleles of the MHC defined as DR15 and DQ6. <b>Other</b> <b>loci</b> have shown a protective effect, such as HLA-C554 and HLA-DRB1*11. Overall, {{it has been estimated that}} HLA changes account for between 20 and 60% of the genetic predisposition. Modern genetic methods (genome-wide association studies) have discovered at least twelve other genes outside the HLA locus that modestly increase the probability of MS.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interesting}} {{feature is}} that the carbonaria had noticeably darkened after about a century. This was seen quite clearly when specimens collected about 1880 were compared with specimens collected more recently: clearly the dark morph has been adjusted by the strong selection acting on the gene complex. This might happen if a more extreme allele was available at the same locus; or genes at <b>other</b> <b>loci</b> might act as modifiers. We do not, of course, {{know anything about the}} genetics of the original melanics from the nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} K {{controls}} {{the degree of}} epistasis in the NK model, or how much <b>other</b> <b>loci</b> affect the fitness contribution of a given locus. With K = 0, the fitness of a given string is a simple sum of individual contributions of loci: for nontrivial fitness functions, a global optimum is present and easy to locate (the genome of all 0s if f(0) > f(1), or all 1s if f(1) > f(0)). For nonzero K, the fitness of a string is a sum of fitnesses of substrings, which may interact to frustrate the system (consider how to achieve optimal fitness in the example above). Increasing K thus increases the ruggedness of the fitness landscape.|$|E
50|$|Transposon {{can be used}} as tag for a DNA with a know sequence. Transposon {{can appear}} at <b>other</b> <b>locus</b> through {{transcription}} or reverse transcription by the effect of nuclease. This appearance of transposon proved that genome is not statistical, but always changing the structure of itself.|$|R
40|$|A novel gene was {{identified}} in the Treponema denticola prcA-prtP protease operon. Strains with mutations in either the prcA-prtP or the msp region showed altered expression of a product(s) of the <b>other</b> <b>locus.</b> Together, these results provide information on the assembly of outer membrane complexes involved in T. denticola interaction with host cells and tissue...|$|R

Participants with higher internality locus-of-control scores and activity scores (personality) reported more favorable employment outcomes. Higher scores on chance and powerful <b>others</b> (<b>locus</b> of control), neuroticism, and aggression/hostility (personality) {{were associated with}} diminished employment outcomes...|$|R
25|$|The final known {{associated}} gene is EFHC1, {{which is}} poorly understood. EFHC1 has three DM10 domains (themselves of unknown function) and an EF hand motif, {{which is known}} to bind intracellular calcium. EFHC1 is expressed in many tissues, including the brain, where it is localized to the soma and dendrites of neurons, particularly the hippocampal CA1 region, pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex, and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. There are 5 mutations in EFHC1 associated with JME; D210N, F229L, D253Y, P77T and R221H. The last two mutations were originally detected as a pair in the same individual. EFHC1 seems {{to be involved in}} programmed cell death as EFHC1 transfected cells have a higher rate of apoptosis. This rate is decreased by the double mutations P77T + R221H. Wild-type EFHC1 increased the R-type calcium channel currents in transfected cells. This stimulation is decreased by JME associated mutations. Because of this, programmed cell death is decreased and the pruning of unwanted neurons may be hampered. As with some <b>other</b> <b>loci,</b> mutations in EFHC1 is not a common loci for JME. More recently, R221H has been found without P77T in one JME kindred.|$|E

In <b>other</b> <b>loci,</b> fragments were found of the books of Genesis, Leviticus, Psalms, and Sirach, {{as well as of the}} Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice.|$|E
40|$|A form of {{congenital}} hypotrichosis, {{commonly known}} as rat-tail, {{is characterized by the}} colored hair anywhere on the body being short, curly, malformed, and sometimes sparse and an abnormal tail switch.

50|$|First Hit: The {{first hit}} is classically {{thought of as}} a point mutation, but {{generally}} arises due to epigenetic events which inactivate one copy of a tumor suppressor gene (TSG), such as Rb1. In hereditary cancer syndromes, individuals are born with the first hit. The individual does not develop cancer at this point because the remaining TSG allele on the <b>other</b> <b>locus</b> is still functioning normally.|$|R

2500|$|Haplogroup H {{accounts}} for about half the gene lines in Europe, with many subgroups. The above mtDNA lineages or their precursors, {{are most likely to}} have arrived into Europe via the Middle East. This contrasts with Y DNA evidence, whereby some 50%-plus of male lineages are characterised by the R1 superfamily, which is of possible central Asian origin. Ornella Semino postulates that these differences [...] "may be {{due in part to the}} apparent more recent molecular age of Y chromosomes relative to <b>other</b> <b>loci,</b> suggesting more rapid replacement of previous Y chromosomes. Gender-based differential migratory demographic behaviors will also influence the observed patterns of mtDNA and Y variation".|$|E

50|$|If all {{genes are}} in linkage equilibrium, {{the effect of}} an allele at one locus can be {{averaged}} across the gene pool at <b>other</b> <b>loci.</b> In reality, one allele is frequently found in linkage disequilibrium with genes at <b>other</b> <b>loci,</b> especially with genes located nearby on the same chromosome. Recombination breaks up this linkage disequilibrium too slowly to avoid genetic hitchhiking, where an allele at one locus rises to high frequency because it is linked to an allele under selection at a nearby locus. Linkage also slows down the rate of adaptation, even in sexual populations. The effect of linkage disequilibrium in slowing down the rate of adaptive evolution arises {{from a combination of}} the Hill-Robertson effect (delays in bringing beneficial mutations together) and background selection (delays in separating beneficial mutations from deleterious hitchhikers).|$|E
40|$|Equilibria are {{determined}} for the two-locus model in a partially selfing population when one locus is neutral and the <b>other</b> <b>locus</b> is heterotic. At an equilibrium point, {{the frequency of}} heterozygotes at the neutral locus is greater than that expected from one-locus theory, even if the heterotic locus is on a different chromosome. Thus, the neutral locus {{also appears to be}} heterotic. The magnitude of this effect is determined for several different proportions of selfing and amounts of recombination...|$|R
5000|$|Debate {{has tended}} to centre round the question, could the {{component}} genes in a super-gene have started off on separate chromosomes, with subsequent reorganization, or is it necessary for them to start on the same chromosome? Many scientists today believe the latter, because some linkage disequilibrium is initially needed to select for tighter linkage, and linkage disequilibrium requires both the previous existence of polymorphisms via some other process, like natural selection, favouring gene combinations. If genes are weakly linked, {{it is probable that}} the rarer advantageous haplotype dies out, leading to the loss of polymorphism at the <b>other</b> <b>locus.</b>|$|R
50|$|There is a {{large number}} of <b>other</b> {{candidate}} <b>loci</b> which either should be looked at or {{have been shown to be}} promising. Several genome-wide scans have been performed identifying markers across many chromosomes.|$|R
5000|$|Molecular markers {{provide only}} a “sample” {{of the genetic}} {{information}} in which to compare individuals of populations, and can differ from actual genetic differentiation. For example, {{it is possible that}} two individual are identical at a given locus, having the same mutation even from its common ancestor, but could differ at <b>other</b> <b>loci</b> that were not observed (or sequenced).|$|E
50|$|Recent {{research}} efforts focus on new angiogenic treatment modalities and various (adult) stem-cell therapies. A region on chromosome 17 {{was confined to}} families with multiple cases of myocardial infarction. Other genome-wide studies have identified a firm risk variant on chromosome 9 (9p21.3). However these and <b>other</b> <b>loci</b> are found in intergenic segments and need further research in understanding how the phenotype is affected.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} speculated that in any {{particular}} population, relatively few genes would show observable paramutation since the high penetrance of paramutagenic alleles (like B’ at the r1 locus in maize) would drive either the paramutagenic or paramutable allele to fixation. Paramutation at <b>other</b> <b>loci</b> with paramutagenic alleles with lower penetrance may persist, however, which {{may need to be}} taken into account by plant breeders.|$|E

50|$|Selectionist {{hypotheses}} {{argue that}} selection {{is the driving}} force of molecular evolution. While acknowledging that many mutations are neutral, selectionists attribute changes in the frequencies of neutral alleles to linkage disequilibrium with <b>other</b> <b>loci</b> that are under selection, rather than to random genetic drift. Biases in codon usage are usually explained with reference to the ability of even weak selection to shape molecular evolution.|$|E
50|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} {{to determine if the}} mutation known for the PNKD locus on chromosome 2q33-35 was the cause of PED. In addition, <b>other</b> <b>loci</b> were observed such as the familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) locus on chromosome 19p, or the familial infantile convulsions and paroxysmal choreoathetosis (ICCA). All three of these suspected regions were found to not contain any mutations, and were therefore ruled out as possible candidates for a cause of PED.|$|E
5000|$|Epistasis {{means that}} the {{phenotypic}} and/or fitness effect of an allele at one locus depends on which alleles are present at <b>other</b> <b>loci.</b> Selection does not act on a single locus, but on a phenotype that arises through development from a complete genotype. However, many population genetics models of sexual species are [...] "single locus" [...] models, where the fitness of an individual is calculated {{as the product of}} the contributions from each of its loci—effectively assuming no epistasis.|$|E
