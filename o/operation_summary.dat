40|$|Background. Direct {{intra-articular}} {{injection of}} low doses of local anesthetic (IALA) after {{closure of the}} joint capsule remains controversial for pain control after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Methods. A retrospective study comparing patients receiving IALA with high doses (0. 5 % bupivacaine 60 [*]mL) of local anesthetics or FNB in addition to intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with opioids for pain management after TKA was conducted. The primary end point was to compare the analgesic efficacy and early ambulation between the two groups. Results. No {{significant differences between the}} two groups in pain intensity, cumulative opioid consumption, incidences of opioid-related side effects, the time interval from the end of operation to the first time the patient could walk assisted with a walker postoperatively, and postoperative hospital stay were identified.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{was to determine whether}} surgical enucleation of mucinous cystadenoma of the pancreas is a safe and adequate <b>operation.</b> <b>SUMMARY</b> BACKGROUND DATA: Mucinous cystadenomas of the pancreas are premalignant cystic lesions. Resection is the preferred treatment but often requires a pancreatoduodenectomy or a distal pancreatectomy with or without a splenectomy. Although these procedures can now be performed with a low mortality rate, substantial morbidity still occurs, especially in patients who have an otherwise normal pancreas. METHODS: Between January 1990 and June 1997, 36 mucinous cystadenomas of the pancreas were resected at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. Most of these patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy. However, 10 patients (28 %) underwent enucleation of their cystic tumor. These 10 patients had a mean age of 63 years, and 6 were men. The cystic lesion was demonstrated by computed tomography in all patients. Enucleation of the cyst was performed in each patient, and four underwent another concomitant abdominal procedure. These 10 patients were followed with periodic computed tomographic scans and clinical examinations. RESULTS: Enucleation took less time and was associated with less blood loss than resection. Pancreatic fistulas occurred more frequently after enucleation, but the incidence of major complications was similar between the two groups. Follow-up after enucleation averaged 43 months, and none of the patients developed late sequelae or recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: This experience suggests that enucleation of mucinous cystadenomas of the pancreas can be performed safely and that the recurrence rate is low after this procedure. The authors conclude that enucleation is an adequate procedure for benign cystic neoplasms of the pancreas...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to (1) correlate and sphincter defects, identified by endoanal ultrasound with operative findings, and (2) define the appearance of such sphincter defects as seen at <b>operation.</b> <b>SUMMARY</b> BACKGROUND DATA: Endoanal ultrasonography is a minimally invasive method of imaging the anal sphincter complex and enables identification of anal sphincter defects. Little {{is known about the}} accuracy and limitations of endoanal ultrasound in identifying such defects. Furthermore, there are no data about the appearances of these endosonic sphincter defects as seen at operation. METHODS: Forty-four patients (40 women; age range, 26 to 80 years; mean age, 56 years) with fecal incontinence, undergoing pelvic floor repair, were investigated by endoanal ultrasound before operation. Endosonic findings were correlated with the appearances of external anal sphincter, internal anal sphincter, and intersphincteric space, at operation. Diagnosis of the site and type of defect was made by macroscopic appearances. Uncertainty about the type of sphincter defect was resolved by obtaining muscle biopsies for histology. RESULTS: All external sphincter defects seen by endoanal ultrasound (n = 23) were confirmed at operation. Twenty-one of 22 internal sphincter defects identified by endosonography also were confirmed at operation. In ten patients with a neuropathic anal sphincter complex, the morphology was normal on endosonography, and this was confirmed at operation. (Sensitivity and specificity of 100 % for external anal sphincter; 100 % and 95. 5 %, respectively, for internal and sphincter) CONCLUSIONS: These data show that endoanal ultrasound is an accurate method of identifying anal sphincter defects...|$|E
40|$|A crucial {{challenge}} for the function of implantable blood pumps for long-term use is the hemocompatibility. Essentially, the mechanical damage of blood cells {{and the formation of}} blood clots have to be avoided. Therefore not only a well-guided blood flow alongside the pump has to be ensured, but also the rotor bearing has to be designed with special attention. In this thesis a concept of a contact-less rotor bearing for rotational blood pumps is developed. Following the standard engineering design processes, the boundary conditions for the use of miniature axial-flow pumps are defined and potential solutions are presented. After the evaluation of the principle solutions a hydrodynamic and/or magnetic bearing is proposed. The solution of a hybrid bearing implementing both principles is selected. However, the magnetic component is purely derived from the existing magnetic face coupling. Different embodiment variations of the hydrodynamic bearing are shown and discussed. The spiral groove bearing (SGB) yields the best results considering the given requirements. The theoretical background is outlined and a SGB is designed. Subsequently, the hydraulic performance of the bearing is assessed. Using flow visualisation techniques the flow within the grooves is analysed. Tracer particles show a fully developed velocity field. There is no acceleration of the flow within the grooves and the fluid moves evenly towards the centre. Computational fluid dynamics show pressure gradients, velocity vectors as well as shear stress distribution inside the SGB. A stationary vortex at the groove entrance is clearly visible. Hence, there is barely a fluid exchange between the bearing and its surroundings. A theoretical characterisation of the start-up behaviour on an ersatz-model provides information on the minimal gap width and the minimal rotational speed for a contact-less <b>operation.</b> <b>Summary</b> and discussion of the results conclude this thesis.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{addressed}} {{whether a}} repeat hepatic operation is warranted {{in patients with}} recurrent isolated hepatic metastases. Are the results as good after second operation as after first hepatic <b>operation?</b> <b>SUMMARY</b> BACKGROUND DATA: Five-year survival after initial hepatic operation for colorectal metastases is approximately 33 %. Because available alternative methods of treatment provide inferior results, hepatic resection for isolated colorectal metastasis currently is well accepted as the best treatment option. However, {{the main cause of}} death after liver resection for colorectal metastasis is tumor recurrence. METHODS: Records of 95 patients undergoing initial hepatic operation and 10 patients undergoing repeat operation for isolated hepatic metastases were reviewed for operative morbidity and mortality, survival, disease-free survival, and pattern of failure. The literature on repeat hepatic resection for colorectal metastases was reviewed. RESULTS: The mean interval between the initial colon operation and first hepatic resection was 14 months. The mean interval {{between the first and second}} hepatic operation was 17 months. Operative mortality was 0 %. At a mean follow-up of 33 +/- 27 months, survival in these ten patients was 100 % at 1 year and 88 % +/- 12 % at 2 years. Disease-free survival at 1 and 3 years was 60 % +/- 16 % and 45 % +/- 17 %, respectively. After second hepatic operation, recurrence has been identified in 60 % of patients at a mean of 24 +/- 30 months (median 9 months). Two of these ten patients had a third hepatic resection. Survival and disease-free survival for the 10 patients compared favorably with the 95 patients who underwent initial hepatic resection. CONCLUSIONS: Repeat hepatic operation for recurrent colorectal metastasis to the liver yields comparable results to first hepatic operations in terms of operative mortality and morbidity, survival, disease-free survival, and pattern of recurrence. This work helps to establish that repeat hepatic operation is the most successful form of treatment for isolated recurrent colorectal metastases...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{define the}} {{technical}} factors that {{might contribute to}} hospital mortality of recipients of right lobe live donor liver transplantation (LDLT) so as to perfect {{the design of the}} <b>operation.</b> <b>Summary</b> Background Data: Right lobe LDLT has been accepted as one of the treatments for patients with terminal hepatic failure, but the design and results of the reported series vary and the technical factors affecting hospital mortality have not been known. Methods: The data of 100 adult-to-adult right lobe LDLT performed between 1996 and 2002 were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. All grafts except one contained the middle hepatic vein, which was anastomosed to the recipient middle/left hepatic vein in the first 84 recipients and directly into the inferior vena cava (with the right hepatic vein in form of venoplasty) in the subsequent 15 patients. Venovenous bypass was used routinely in the first 29 patients but not subsequently. Results: Eight patients died within the same hospital admission for liver transplantation. There was no hospital mortality in the last 53 recipients. Comparison of data of patients with or without hospital mortality showed that graft weight/body weight ratio, graft weight/ estimated standard liver weight ratio, technical error resulting in occlusion/absence of the middle hepatic vein, use of venovenous bypass, the lowest body temperature recorded during surgery, the volume of intraoperative blood transfusion, fresh frozen plasma, and platelet infusion were significantly different between the two groups. However, the pretransplant intensive care unit status of the recipients, cold and warm ischemic time of the graft, and occurrence of biliary complications were not. By multivariate analysis, low body temperature recorded during operation, low graft weight/estimated standard liver weight ratio (≤ 0. 35), and the middle hepatic vein occlusion were independent significant factors in determining hospital mortality. Conclusions: To achieve a uniformly successful right lobe LDLT, the right lobe graft must contain a patent middle hepatic vein. With a completely patent middle hepatic vein, a graft size of > 35 % of the estimated standard graft weight may be sufficient for recipient survival. Hypothermia, which predisposes to coagulopathy and is enhanced by the use of venovenous bypass and massive blood, and blood product transfusion must be avoided. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: There is {{considerable}} {{debate about whether}} double parathyroid adenomas are a discrete entity or represent hyperplasia with parathyroid glands of varying sizes. This distinction {{is important because it}} impacts on the extent of parathyroid resection and the success of the parathyroid <b>operation.</b> <b>SUMMARY</b> BACKGROUND DATA: Double parathyroid adenomas have been reported to occur in 1. 7 % to 9 % of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT). It is important for surgeons to differentiate between double adenoma and hyperplasia with glands of varying sizes using gross examination during the initial procedure because microscopic findings of a small biopsy specimen at frozen-section examination may not be diagnostic. METHODS: From 1982 to 1992, 416 unselected patients (309 women and 107 men) with primary HPT without familial HPT or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) were treated by one surgeon at the University of California at San Francisco. Double adenoma occurred in 49 patients, solitary adenoma in 309 patients, and hyperplasia in 58 patients. The authors analyzed the clinical manifestations, the preoperative and postoperative serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone (PTH), and the success rate and outcome after parathyroidectomy and compared their results in 49 patients with double adenomas to the results for patients with solitary adenomas or hyperplasia. RESULTS: Ten of the patients with double adenomas (20. 4 %) were referred for persistent HPT after removal of one abnormal parathyroid gland. The ages of the patients with double adenoma, single adenoma, and hyperplasia were 61 +/- 14, 56 +/- 15, and 58 +/- 7 years, respectively. Fatigue, muscle weakness, and bone pain were common in patients with double adenomas, whereas nephrolithiasis occurred more frequently in patients with solitary adenoma (p = 0. 0001). Serum calcium and PTH levels (per cent of upper limit of normal) fell from 11. 5 +/- 1. 2 mg/dL and 487 % to 9. 5 +/- 0. 8 mg/dL and 61 % for patients with double adenomas; from 11. 9 +/- 0. 9 mg/dL and 378 % to 9. 3 +/- 1. 4 mg/dL and 101 % for patients with single adenoma; and from 10. 9 +/- 0. 5 mg/dL and 418 % to 9. 1 +/- 0. 7 mg/dL and 94 % for patients with hyperplasia, respectively. There was no recurrence in the patients with double adenomas with a mean follow-up time of 5. 8 years. CONCLUSIONS: Double adenomas are a discrete entity and occur more often in older patients.

40|$|Although the {{software}} industry is flourishing, and software-producing organizations strive for {{high levels of}} end-user satisfaction, these organizations do only limitedly recognize and use knowledge of the in-the-field operation of their software (e. g. software operation knowledge or SOK). Less than one-third of these organizations makes use of crash and usage feedback reports to acquire knowledge of the in-the-field behavior of their software and end-users. Furthermore, the concept of software operation knowledge has only been vaguely described, and is underexposed till date. For example, virtually no techniques or methods exist for structurally using such knowledge in processes implemented at software-producing organizations. Consequently, an emerging need is observed for a framework that guides software-producing organizations in improving their software processes through knowledge of the in-the-field behavior of their software and end-users. In this dissertation research, a framework is presented that provides and structures directions for identification, acquisition, integration, presentation and utilization of software operation knowledge. The framework, {{as well as the}} tools, techniques and methods that are presented in this dissertation, aid software-producing organizations in increasing the efficiency of their software processes. This dissertation is divided in four parts. After the introductory part, which describes research triggers, questions and methods, the SOK concept is defined. Also, the SOK framework is presented: a structure that describes parties, perspectives and life cycle processes related to knowledge of in-the-field software operation. The SOK concept is then further established by identification and classification of operational software operation knowledge practices of software-producing organizations in software ecosystems. The third part of this dissertation is focused on process improvement through knowledge of in-the-field software operation. A novel technique for generic recording and visualization of in-the-field software operation is presented. We show that this technique enables software vendors to obtain a uniform insight in the operation of their software in the field, and contributes to reduction of software maintenance efforts. Also, we present a template method for situational integration of software operation information in software processes. We show that by using the template method, software-producing organizations can improve their particular software processes with acquired software operation information. Another artifact that is presented in this dissertation is {{the software}} <b>operation</b> <b>summary</b> (SOS), a medium for presentation of software operation information. We show that the summary increases awareness of in-the-field software operation throughout software-producing organizations, and demonstrate that it contributes to reaching consensus on software maintenance task prioritization. Finally, service knowledge utilization (SKU) is introduced as an approach to increase a software vendor's flexibility, as well as its responsiveness to changes in performance and usage of its service-based, online software. The last part of this dissertation provides answers to the formulated research questions, as well as a reflection on the hermeneutic process we experienced throughout the construction of the artifacts that are presented in this dissertation...|$|E
