25|$|The Australian, New Zealand, and European Union {{national}} nutrition bodies note {{there have}} been no reports of choline deficiency in the general population. The USA joins these three in not publishing a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), due to lack of consensus evidence. They have, however, published Adequate Intake (AI) values. The US Institute of Medicine (IOM) notes that these figures are based on just one study and that there was little data and the choline made by the body (assuming a dietary intake of zero) may be enough for some groups. Australia, New Zealand and Canada use the figures published by the US IOM. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published its own Adequate Intake values, most recently in 2016. For U.S. dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent <b>of</b> <b>Daily</b> <b>Value</b> (%DV) <b>based</b> on the AI.

40|$|The use {{of digital}} {{technologies}} in livestock businesses {{can improve the}} efficiency of farmers managing welfare and productivity of their animals. One opportunity is to use high resolution livestock behaviour information to inform decision making. Livestock behaviour recorded by sensors such as GPS or accelerometers, can be analysed to capture activities that can inform farm management. In this paper, our focus was on livestock grazing behaviour {{in relation to the}} feed supply in extensive grazing systems. We investigated the use of a Deep Belief Network (DBN) to predict the Metabolizable Energy Intake (MEI) of sheep directly using sensors. With the complexity and the availability of more data forms especially in the sensor data, the use of DBN was evaluated as an analytical method that could be applied to improve farmer’s understanding of livestock grazing behaviour and feedbase management by the prediction <b>of</b> MEI <b>values</b> <b>daily.</b> <b>Based</b> on a field experiment, results generated from the DBN achieved with the MSE result of 5. 6 to the training dataset and the testing dataset of 11. 6. This demonstrated that the DBN method can be undertaken to predict the MEI for sheep using sensor data. Furthermore, by finding out which factors influenced grazing behaviour this study can be used to better interpret biological interactions in grazing systems, and potentially be extended to develop sensor technologies and new analytical methods in other agricultural domains...|$|R

30|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to study an {{extended}} spectrum of airborne pollen characteristics (19 plant taxa) for the Szeged region in Southern Hungary. A novel procedure is introduced in order to separate the current and past effects of the climate variables influencing the current pollen concentration.

This kind of separation has not been demonstrated in the literature.
