5|$|Analog {{computers}} {{work directly}} with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms {{depend on the}} form of the addends. A mechanical adder might represent two addends as the positions of sliding blocks, in which case they can be added with an averaging lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two shafts, they can be added with a differential. A hydraulic adder can add the pressures in two chambers by exploiting Newton's second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two voltages (referenced to ground); this can be accomplished roughly with a resistor network, but a better design exploits an <b>operational</b> <b>amplifier.</b>|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{current drawn}} into the <b>operational</b> <b>amplifier</b> from the power supply {{can be used as}} inputs to {{external}} circuitry that augment the capabilities of the <b>operational</b> <b>amplifier.</b> For example, an <b>operational</b> <b>amplifier</b> may not be fit for a particular high-gain application because its output would be required to generate signals outside of the safe range generated by the amplifier. In this case, an external pushpull amplifier can be controlled by the current {{into and out of the}} <b>operational</b> <b>amplifier.</b> Thus, the <b>operational</b> <b>amplifier</b> may itself operate within its factory specified bounds while still allowing the negative feedback path to include a large output signal well outside of those bounds.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. In this study, CMOS implementation of composite <b>operational</b> <b>amplifiers</b> onto a single chip is examined. Composite <b>operational</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are realized by interconnecting {{two or more}} single <b>operational</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{in any one of}} four high performance circuit topologies. These high performance topologies result in composite <b>operational</b> <b>amplifiers</b> having useful bandwidths that are significantly larger than those associated with their constituent <b>operational</b> <b>amplifiers</b> without sacrificing closed loop gain. Computer simulations using PSPICE are compared with experimental results for performance evaluation. As an application a multiple feedback bandpass filter implementation is examined.

25|$|Common-mode gain: A perfect <b>operational</b> <b>amplifier</b> amplifies {{only the}} voltage {{difference}} between its two inputs, completely rejecting all voltages {{that are common}} to both. However, the differential input stage of an <b>operational</b> <b>amplifier</b> is never perfect, leading to the amplification of these common voltages to some degree. The standard measure of this defect is called the common-mode rejection ratio (denoted CMRR). Minimization of common mode gain is usually important in non-inverting amplifiers (described below) that operate at high amplification.|$|E

40|$|<b>Operational</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are an {{integral}} part of many analog and mixed signal systems. As the demand for mixed mode integrated circuits increases, the design of analog circuits such as <b>operational</b> <b>amplifiers</b> in CMOS technology becomes more critical. <b>Operational</b> <b>amplifiers</b> with moderate DC gain, high output swing and reasonable open loop Gain Band Width product (GBW) are usually implemented with two stage structures.

25|$|Due to {{the strong}} (i.e., unity gain) {{feedback}} and certain non-ideal characteristics of real operational amplifiers, this feedback system is prone to have poor stability margins. Consequently, the system may be unstable when connected to sufficiently capacitive loads. In these cases, a lag compensation network (e.g., connecting the load to the voltage follower through a resistor) {{can be used to}} restore stability. The manufacturer data sheet for the <b>operational</b> <b>amplifier</b> may provide guidance for the selection of components in external compensation networks. Alternatively, another <b>operational</b> <b>amplifier</b> can be chosen that has more appropriate internal compensation.|$|E
25|$|Some devices (μA748, LM301, LM308) are not {{internally}} compensated (require {{an external}} capacitor from output to some point within the <b>operational</b> <b>amplifier,</b> if used in low closed-loop gain applications).|$|E

25|$|Finite gain: Open-loop gain is {{infinite}} in {{the ideal}} <b>operational</b> <b>amplifier</b> but finite in real operational amplifiers. Typical devices exhibit open-loop DC gain ranging from 100,000 to over 1 million. So {{long as the}} loop gain (i.e., the product of open-loop and feedback gains) is very large, the circuit gain will be determined entirely {{by the amount of}} negative feedback (i.e., it will be independent of open-loop gain). In cases where closed-loop gain must be very high, the feedback gain will be very low, and the low feedback gain causes low loop gain; in these cases, the <b>operational</b> <b>amplifier</b> will cease to behave ideally.|$|E

25|$|In this case, the <b>operational</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{drives the}} {{transistor}} with more current if the voltage at its inverting input drops below {{the output of}} the voltage reference at the non-inverting input.

25|$|An <b>operational</b> <b>amplifier</b> (often op-amp or opamp) is a DC-coupled high-gain {{electronic}} {{voltage amplifier}} with a differential input and, usually, a single-ended output. In this configuration, an op-amp produces an output potential (relative to circuit ground) that is typically {{hundreds of thousands}} of times larger than the potential difference between its input terminals.|$|E
25|$|Input current: Due to biasing {{requirements}} or leakage, a {{small amount}} of current (typically ~10 nanoamperes for bipolar op-amps, tens of picoamperes (pA) for JFET input stages, and only a few pA for MOSFET input stages) flows into the inputs. When large resistors or sources with high output impedances are used in the circuit, these small currents can produce large unmodeled voltage drops. If the input currents are matched, and the impedance looking out of both inputs are matched, then the voltages produced at each input will be equal. Because the <b>operational</b> <b>amplifier</b> operates on the difference between its inputs, these matched voltages will have no effect. It is more common for the input currents to be slightly mismatched. The difference is called input offset current, and even with matched resistances a small offset voltage (different from the input offset voltage below) can be produced. This offset voltage can create offsets or drifting in the <b>operational</b> <b>amplifier.</b>|$|E
