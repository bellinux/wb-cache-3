5|$|Most bogs {{exist in}} glaciated areas, but Black Moshannon State Park {{is on the}} Allegheny Plateau. This area was not covered by glaciers during the last ice age. The bogs formed here because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> of {{sandstone}} that lie flat, a short distance {{below the surface of}} the earth. The sandstone formations in the park do not absorb water very well, so any depression in them will collect water, as has happened here. The bogs extend the shores of the lake. Migratory shorebirds that visit here include greater and lesser yellowlegs, least sandpiper, solitary sandpiper, and the spotted sandpiper, which has been confirmed as using the IBA as a breeding grounds.|$|E
5|$|The debtors' {{prison at}} the castle {{came in for}} {{particular}} scrutiny. It emerged {{that out of the}} 402 cases brought before the court at St Briavels' Castle, 397 of them were for extremely small sums of debt of £5 or less (£373 in 2009 prices), increasingly unacceptable in Victorian eyes. A penalty of up to £7 (£522 in 2009 prices) was also being charged for each case, making the process extremely onerous for the local poor being prosecuted in this way. The investigation found that the keeper of the debtors' prison, which could hold up to six inmates at a time, was appointed by the constable, and made part of his income by charging each prisoner one shilling a week for the use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> in the prison; with no other public funding, prisoners depended on friends or relatives for food and other essentials, or from donations from their original parishes.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, oysters were cheap and mainly eaten by the working class. Throughout the 19th century, oyster beds in New York Harbor became the {{largest source of}} oysters worldwide. On any day in the late 19th century, six million oysters could be found on barges tied up along the city's waterfront. They were {{naturally}} quite popular in New York City, and helped initiate the city's restaurant trade. New York's oystermen became skilled cultivators of their beds, which provided employment for hundreds of workers and nutritious food for thousands. Eventually, rising demand exhausted many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds.</b> To increase production, they introduced foreign species, which brought disease; effluent and increasing sedimentation from erosion destroyed most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> by the early 20th century. Oysters' popularity has put ever-increasing demands on wild oyster stocks. This scarcity increased prices, converting them from their original role as working-class food to their current status as an expensive delicacy.|$|E

The longer {{axis of the}} basin trends towards the NNE, being flanked on the west by the Carboniferous rocks of north Wales and to the east by the Pennine Foothills.

25|$|Soil in {{the borough}} is principally of poor to {{moderate}} agricultural quality although high grade land {{is present in}} pockets. The south of the borough has acid soils and gravels, but poorly drained clays predominate in the north. Most of the borough is covered {{by a series of}} clays and marls, with sandy and lignitic beds, part of the Bracklesham Group of beds. As well as clay soils, the Bracklesham Beds result in some bands of sandy soil to the north of West End, and podzol soils around the M27 motorway west of Hedge End and on small areas of the gravels on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> themselves. However most of the soil over the beds is more fertile brown earth.|$|E

25|$|Acton Shale is a grey {{to black}} thinly {{laminated}} silceous shale containing graptolites. It is generally leached, and frequently silicified. The colour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> alternates between grey and black, but where weathered, it changes to whitish grey. The graptolites {{appear on the}} bedding planes as black films. In Canberra, the Acton Shale appears in several outcrops in Acton, in two bands through Aranda, through Bruce near the Calvary Hospital, on the Bruce Ridge behind Lyneham. Also another band starts under the University of Canberra in Belconnen, and heads north east through Lawson and Giralang and folded and faulted into several bands in Crace on Gungahlin Hill. Another band is found {{on the west side}} of Queanbeyan, extending north to Dundee, and south around the east side of Jerrabomberra Hill.|$|E
25|$|Overlying the Beacon Hill Formation, {{but found}} {{a little further}} down the {{hillside}} to the south, are the Bradgate Formation beds, the most notable {{of which is the}} Sliding Stone Slump Breccia rocks. Forming a line of crags below Old John, these are laminated mudstones, with layers of sandstone, mainly of volcanic origin. The beds are substantially warped, contorted and folded. Many of the more intricate folds and 'sag' patterns are thought to have occurred while the sediments were unconsolidated and water saturated. Suggested causes for these include slumping, earth tremors and fault-movements, trapped water or gases and volcanic bomb impacts. Outcrops of other rocks of the Bradgate Formation are found further down the slope. These are younger than and stratigraphically above the breccia, but the uplift from ancient mountain-building, the dip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> and erosion of overlying rocks mean that the younger rocks are encountered at progressively lower altitudes.|$|E
25|$|A signal {{event in}} the Roman medical {{community}} was {{the construction of the}} first Aesculapium in the city of Rome, on Tiber Island. In 293 BCE some officials consulted the Sibylline Books concerning measures to be taken against the plague and were advised to bring Aesculapius from Epidaurus to Rome. The sacred serpent from Epidaurus was conferred ritually on the new temple, or, in some accounts, the serpent escaped from the ship and swam to the island. Baths have been found there as well as votive offerings (donaria) in the shape of specific organs. In classical times the center covered the entire island and included a long-term recovery center. The emperor Claudius had a law passed granting freedom to slaves who had been sent to the institution for cure but were abandoned there. This law probably facilitated state disposition of the patients and recovery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> they occupied. The details are not available.|$|E

25|$|The National Medical Center of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) was {{considered}} the most important hospital complex in Latin America with over 2,300 beds and the largest medical library in the country. It had to be evacuated because all of its 25 buildings suffered severe damage. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> that it lost were dedicated to tertiary, high-technology care. The ISSSTE hospital for government workers lost 36 percent of its capacity. The 2,158 beds of the Ministry of Health (SSA) were lost, representing 43 percent of its capacity in the city. This included the 700 beds lost with the complete collapse of Juárez Hospital and the gynecology-obstetrics tower of the General Hospital of Mexico. In total, the city lost more than 4,000 public hospital beds in the earthquake, severely disrupting these institutions' ability to handle the crisis. In addition, five of the largest private hospitals had to be evacuated. More than 900 patients, physicians, nurses and paramedical workers died in the initial shock.|$|E
25|$|Sedimentary {{rocks are}} {{laid down in}} layers called beds or strata. A bed {{is defined as a}} layer of rock that has a uniform {{lithology}} and texture. Beds form by the deposition of layers of sediment on top of each other. The sequence of beds that characterizes sedimentary rocks is called bedding. Single beds can be a couple of centimetres to several meters thick. Finer, less pronounced layers are called laminae, and the structure it forms in a rock is called lamination. Laminae are usually less than a few centimetres thick. Though bedding and lamination are often originally horizontal in nature, this is not always the case. In some environments, beds are deposited at a (usually small) angle. Sometimes multiple sets of layers with different orientations exist in the same rock, a structure called cross-bedding. Cross-bedding forms when small-scale erosion occurs during deposition, cutting off part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds.</b> Newer beds then form at an angle to older ones.|$|E
