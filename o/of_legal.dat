5|$|During the 12th and 13th centuries, law {{was taught}} in the City of London, {{primarily}} by the clergy. During the 13th century, two events happened that destroyed this form <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> education; firstly, a decree by Henry III of England on 2 December 1234 that no institutes <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> education could exist in the City of London, and secondly a papal bull was issued in 1254 that prohibited the clergy from teaching the common law, rather than canon law. As a result, the existing system <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> education fell apart. The common lawyers migrated to the hamlet of Holborn, the nearest place to the law courts at Westminster Hall that was outside the City.|$|E

Theoretical interpretation is often supported by practical examples that are used to improve the intelligibility of the thesis and understandability of individual problems.

In relation with that there is explained the essence and purpose <b>of</b> this institution. <b>Legal</b> effect is conceived as the set of the specific properties (impacts), that the judgment acquires when the legal presumptions are fulfilled. There are defined the concepts of the formal and material legal effect including their mutual relation. Attention is also given to the individual impacts <b>of</b> the <b>legal</b> effect as the finality, the immutability and the obligation of the judgment.

5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First English Civil War led to a complete suspension <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> education, and from November 1642 until July 1644 no Pension meetings were held. Only 43 students were admitted during the four years of the war, and none were called to the Bar. Meetings of Pension resumed after the Battle of Marston Moor but the education system remained dormant. Although Readers were appointed, none read, and no moots were held. In 1646, {{after the end of}} the war, there was an attempt to restore the old system of readings and moots, and in 1647 an order was made that students were required to moot at least once a day. This failed to work, with Readers refusing to read, and the old system <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> education completely died out.|$|E

During the Elizabethan age readings were given regularly, moots took place daily and barristers who were called to the Bar were expected to play a part in teaching students, resulting in skilled and knowledgeable graduates from the Inn.|$|E
