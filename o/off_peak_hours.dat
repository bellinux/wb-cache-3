40|$|Although much {{research}} on road traffic noise {{has found that}} noise level increase are influenced by driver behaviour and source- receiver distance, {{little attention has been}} paid to the relationship between noise level and total number of vehicles on the road. In this study, five days measurement of noise level during <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> and <b>off</b> <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> has been carried out at two types of highways; high traffic flow highway (Sungai Besi Expressway) and low traffic flow highway(Duke Highway). Simultaneously, the number of vehicles passing the measurement point were recorded for every 15 minutes. Findings indicated that heavy traffic flow highway recorded higher noise level compared to low traffic flow highway. It was due to the higher number of vehicles on the heavy traffic flow highway than low traffic flow highway.

40|$|Demand {{response}} (DR) is changes {{created by}} customers according to accustomed electric patterns used {{in order to}} reduce or shift usage electrical load over time. Thus, it enable customer participation in reducing electricity consumption during <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> period and increasing electricity consumption during <b>off</b> <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> period This in turn will avoid an excessive utilization of generator during <b>peak</b> <b>hour.</b> This project was focusing on time based program which is consists of Time of Use (ToU) and Real Time Pricing (RTP). Time of Use (ToU) utilize in providing customer with different unit prices for uses in different block of times in 24 hour period while Real Time Pricing (RTP) work in offering the price that fluctuates hourly based on changes in market price. In order to implement time based program in Malaysia, a proper scheme pricing have been proposed. Generally, Malaysia is a monopolized electricity market in which wholesale market price does not existed. Referring on the current scenario, this project was developed to investigate a different pricing schemes demand response model and thus proposing a new pricing scheme to accommodate monopolized market. A comparison of pricing scheme utilize between three different industrial consumers will be discussed and stipulated as the outcome in this research...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{software}} defined {{wireless sensor network}} (SDWSN) based grid to vehicle (G 2 V) load management scheme to initiate <b>off</b> <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> valley filling of the daily power supply curve. In particular, this paper focuses on domestic Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) charging that adopts smart energy allocation technique to maximize the number of charging vehicles and uses a Software Defined Network (SDN) to enable adaptive energy supply. A novel energy scheduling algorithm is proposed based on a linear prediction algorithm that suits the network model built upon a SDN paradigm. To demonstrate the proof of concept, an SDN based Smart Grid Neighborhood Area network (SGNAN) operating onto Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is developed using Castalia. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed SDWSN network architecture can efficiently support the G 2 V load management scheme and enables smart valley filling of the daily load curve for maximum utilization of power generation capacity...|$|R
