25|$|Double-stacking {{containers}} {{greatly improved}} <b>operating</b> <b>efficiency</b> by reducing train length {{and the number}} of axles per container, thus saving fuel per ton-mile. Another benefit was created by permanently joining five cars in a set. This reduced the number of couplers, which reduced slack action. Slack is created in any train by the couplers between the cars being stretched and compressed, and in long, heavy trains this can be quite a powerful force. By reducing slack action, the damage caused to the freight transported in containers is also reduced.|$|E

As an aid to performing transition at the right time, the load meter (an indicator that shows the engine driver how much current is being drawn by the traction motors) was calibrated to indicate at which points forward or backward transition should take place. Automatic transition was subsequently developed to produce better <b>operating</b> <b>efficiency</b> and to protect the main generator and traction motors from overloading from improper transition.|$|E
25|$|Six-year {{graduation}} {{rates for the}} 2004 cohort at University Park was 85.3 percent. Graduation rates by race among this group are 86.6 percent white, 75.0 percent black, 81.9 percent Asian, 77.4 percent Hispanic, 57.1 percent Native American and 76.1 percent international students. According to a 2006 survey by USA Today, the university's flagship campus, University Park, has the highest in-state tuition rates among comparable institutions nationwide. While a task force formed in 2001 to study options for tuition projections determined that the university's <b>operating</b> <b>efficiency</b> is {{among the highest in}} postsecondary education, it found that tuition increases at Penn State still consistently outpaced increases at other Big Ten Conference institutions. Student leaders of The Council of Commonwealth Student Governments (CCSG) have led annual rallies to support lower rate hikes at each of the nineteen commonwealth campuses and at the Pennsylvania state capitol in Harrisburg. In 2005, the board of trustees proposed a tuition freeze at the commonwealth campus locations as part of its state appropriation request.|$|E

2500|$|The reform {{resulted}} in new generation facilities, which were built and {{financed by the}} private sector, and investment in distribution by the privatized companies. Thanks to the new investments, {{between the end of}} 2000 and mid-2003, effective capacity experienced a 43% increase, with the distribution network also showing improvement.

However, rising oil prices, the introduction of generalized subsidies and political interference negatively affected the sector's financial health.

2500|$|Many financially weak interurbans did {{not survive}} the 1920s; others went {{bankrupt}} during the Great Depression. A few struggling lines tried combining to form much larger systems {{in an attempt to}} gain <b>operating</b> <b>efficiency</b> and a broader customer base. This occurred in Ohio in year 1930 with the long Cincinnati & Lake Erie Railroad (C), and in Indiana with the very widespread Indiana Railroad. Both had limited success up to 1937–1938 primarily from growing revenues earned from freight. The [...] long Sacramento Northern Railway stopped carrying passengers in 1940 but continued hauling freight using heavy electric locomotives into the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|Some street trams (streetcars) used conduit third-rail current collection. The {{third rail}} was below street level. The tram {{picked up the}} current through a plough (U.S. [...] "plow") {{accessed}} through a narrow slot in the road. In the United States, much (though not all) of the former streetcar system in Washington, D.C. (discontinued in 1962) was operated in this manner to avoid the unsightly wires and poles associated with electric traction. The same was true with Manhattan's former streetcar system. The evidence of this mode of running can still {{be seen on the}} track down the slope on the northern access to the abandoned Kingsway Tramway Subway in central London, United Kingdom, where the slot between the running rails is clearly visible, and on P and Q Streets west of Wisconsin Avenue in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington DC, where the abandoned tracks have not been paved over. The slot can easily be confused with the similar looking slot for cable trams/cars (in some cases, the conduit slot was originally a cable slot). The disadvantage of conduit collection included much higher initial installation costs, higher maintenance costs, and problems with leaves and snow getting in the slot. For this reason, in Washington, D.C. cars on some lines converted to overhead wire on leaving the city center, a worker in a [...] "plough pit" [...] disconnecting the plough while another raised the trolley pole (hitherto hooked down to the roof) to the overhead wire. In New York City for the same reasons of cost and <b>operating</b> <b>efficiency</b> outside of Manhattan overhead wire was used. A similar system of changeover from conduit to overhead wire was also used on the London tramways, notably on the southern side; a typical changeover point was at Norwood, where the conduit snaked sideways from between the running rails, to provide a park for detached shoes or ploughs.|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{one or more}} {{receivers}} and a {{heat exchanger}} operate within a closed thermal loop. To maintain efficient overall operation and avoid damage from thermal runaway, the demand for heat from the secondary side of the exchanger must be consistently high. Under such optimal <b>operating</b> conditions, collection <b>efficiencies</b> exceeding 70% (up to ~35% electric, ~40% thermal for HCPVT) are anticipated. Net <b>operating</b> <b>efficiencies</b> may be substantially lower depending on how well a system is engineered to match {{the demands of the}} particular thermal application.|$|R
