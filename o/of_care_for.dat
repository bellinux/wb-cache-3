40|$|The {{difficulties}} <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> preterm {{infants and}} associated psychological stress incurred by parents of preterm infants admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) {{have been well}} established. However, much less is known about parents 2 ̆ 7 experiences <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> preterm infant at home after NICU discharge. This study synthesized qualitative studies on this phenomenon. Nine categories were obtained from 12 qualitative studies and grouped into three syntheses - (1) support improves confidence in care; (2) dealing with challenges <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> preterm infant; (3) overprotective parenting. Parents 2 ̆ 7 experiences <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> preterm infants post-NICU discharge is constructed as a process that requires support to improve caring confidence, a process that deals with the challenges <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> preterm infants after discharge and complicated by overprotective parenting. Thus, NICU nurses must endeavour to provide appropriate support for parents {{in order to increase}} their caring confidence after discharge...|$|R

40|$|Theoretical approaches: Neurosurgery is a {{wide and}} {{sophisticated}} field and given the variety of neurological issues, this thesis focuses on the brain (vascular issues and tumors). Goals: This thesis has two goals. 1. To single out the specifics <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> patients after brain surgery (of selected conditions). 2. To find out, whether the nurses know the specifics <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> a patient after brain surgery. Hypotheses and research questions: H 1 : Nurses with tertiary education have greater theoretical knowledge <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> patients after brain surgery than the nurses without tertiary education. H 2 : Nurses after getting the job <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> patients after brain surgery didn't have an instructor. H 3 : Nurses after getting the job <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> patients after brain surgery, most commonly struggle with an external ventricular drainage system. H 4 : Nurses most commonly gain the required knowledge to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> patients after brain surgery from literature. Research question 1 : What {{is the level of}} knowledge of novice nurses about the specifics <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> a patient with a brain condition? Methodology: The research was split in two parts. For the quantitative part of the research, the questionnaire method was selected. The questionnaire had 22 questions, 17 of them closed, 4 of them semi-open, 1 was an open question. The researchers handed out 300 questionnaires and received 246 (82 %) of them back. 49 questionnaires had to be discarded as invalid. The final research sample consisted of 197 (100 %) filled-out questionnaires. For the qualitative part of the research, the method of semi-structured interviews with open questions was selected. There were a total of 8 interviews conducted. Results: The goal of quantitative part of the research was to confirm or disprove the 4 hypotheses. H 1 : Nurses with tertiary education have greater theoretical knowledge <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> patients after brain surgery than the nurses without tertiary education. Based on the data, we can see that the knowledge of nurses with tertiary education is not different from the knowledge of nurses without tertiary education. H 1 was disproved. H 2 : Nurses after getting the job <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> patients after brain surgery didn't have an instructor. Based on the questionnaire data, nurses did have an instructor. H 2 was disproved. H 3 : Nurses after getting the job <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> patients after brain surgery, most commonly struggle with an external ventricular drainage system. Based on the research data, an external ventricular drainage system is indeed the most commonly quoted problematic procedure when <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> a patient after brain surgery. H 3 was confirmed. H 4 : Nurses most commonly gain the required knowledge to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> patients after brain surgery from literature. The research shows {{that this is not the}} case. Nurses most commonly learn the specifics <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> patients after brain surgery from their instructors. H 4 was disproved. For the qualitative part of the research, the method of semi-structured interviews with open questions was selected. The research question was: What is the level of knowledge of novice nurses about the specifics <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> a patient with a brain condition? The interviews have shown that the knowledge of novice nurses about the specifics <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> patients with a brain condition is on an appropriate level they know the specifics <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> patients after brain surgery. Conclusion:The conducted original research as well as secondary literature has led us to several questions and recommendations: Is the nurse who has just started at the neurosurgery division properly being instructed about the specifics of her new job and is the adaptation process being conducted in the proper fashion? The results of this thesis suggest that a "Caring for patients in neurosurgery" manuscript could be written <b>for</b> general <b>care</b> nurses just starting at neurosurgery. This option was mentioned by some of the respondents in the questionnaire researc...|$|R

Bodemeister {{finished}} a narrow second place in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes to I'll Have Another. Switching horses in the 2012 Belmont Stakes, Zayat's colt Paynter also finished second. Paynter went on to win the Grade I Haskell Invitational but shortly thereafter developed near-fatal complications from colitis and laminitis. Zayat authorized the highest quality <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> the horse, and following abdominal surgery and several months of rehabilitation, Paynter successfully returned to racing in 2013. After Zayat and his son Justin began making regular social media updates on Twitter with the hashtag #PowerUpPaynter, the horse developed a significant fan base, and received hundreds of get well cards, many from children. For his struggle to return to health, Paynter won NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award.|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores {{resilience}} in {{parents of}} adults with intellectual disability. It comprises two chapters. The first chapter is a systematic literature review which examines quantitative research reporting psychosocial outcomes <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> an adult child with intellectual disability. From the 23 identified papers, the {{findings show that}} parents of adults with intellectual disability have significantly poorer psychosocial outcomes when compared to non-caregiving populations. However, further longitudinal {{research is needed to}} establish predictors of poor psychosocial outcomes in parents of adults with intellectual disability. The second chapter is an empirical qualitative study which explores the experience <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> a child with Down syndrome across 50 years. Four main themes were discussed – early experiences and feelings of having child with Down syndrome, factors that enabled carers to cope with raising a child/sibling with Down syndrome, experience <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> an adult with Down syndrome and positive experiences <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> a child/sibling with Down syndrome. Overall, the study highlights the resilience <b>of</b> parents who <b>care</b> <b>for</b> a child with Down syndrome across their lifespan in their ability to adjust to the challenges of this role and draw on the positives of the experience...|$|R

5|$|Transvaginal {{ultrasound}} {{to examine}} the endometrial thickness in women with postmenopausal bleeding is increasingly being used {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of endometrial cancer in the United States. In the United Kingdom, both an endometrial biopsy and a transvaginal ultrasound used in conjunction are the standard <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> diagnosing endometrial cancer. The homogeneity of the tissue visible on transvaginal ultrasound can help to indicate whether the thickness is cancerous. Ultrasound findings alone are not conclusive in cases of endometrial cancer, so another screening method (for example endometrial biopsy) must be used in conjunction. Other imaging studies are of limited use. CT scans are used for preoperative imaging of tumors that appear advanced on physical exam or have a high-risk subtype (at high risk of metastasis). They {{can also be used to}} investigate extrapelvic disease. An MRI can be of some use in determining if the cancer has spread to the cervix or if it is an endocervical adenocarcinoma. MRI is also useful for examining the nearby lymph nodes.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess how}} {{families}} perceive {{the positive and}} negative impacts <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> a child with mental retardation. METHODS: The quantitative descriptive study was conducted from January to August 2007 and comprised 54 families attending a private day-care centre for children with special needs in Karachi, Pakistan. The Kansas Inventory of Parental Perceptions was used to assess mothers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions on the impact <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> a child with mental retardation. Positive contributions, social comparisons with others, understanding of disability and perception of control were assessed. SPSS 16 was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Mothers reported positive contribution to family life as a result <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> a child with mental retardation (Mean: 2. 95 +/- 0. 37). There was an acceptance of the situation and a trend towards upward favourable comparison with other families (Mean: 3. 13 +/- 0. 07).
