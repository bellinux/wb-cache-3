40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} force to failure of {{standard}} premolar brackets {{to that of}} gingivally offset brackets and evaluate the site of bond failure between the two bracket types {{through the use of}} the Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI). Design: An ex vivo study. Setting: Dental Materials Science Laboratory, Dundee Dental School, Dundee. Materials and methods: Forty extracted lower premolar teeth (caries free, extracted as part of orthodontic treatment, all donors living in a non-fluoridated area), divided into two equal size sample groups, as follows: Group 1 : Victory SeriesTM (3 M Unitek, Monrovia CA, USA) lower premolar brackets bonded to buccal surfaces with Transbond XT (3 M Unitek, Monrovia CA). Group 2 : Victory SeriesTM Gingivally Offset Bicuspid Brackets (3 M Unitek, Monrovia CA) bonded to buccal surfaces with Transbond XT (3 M Unitek, Monrovia CA). Force was applied in the occluso-gingival direction using an Instron Model 4469 Universal Testing Machine (Instron Ltd, High Wycombe, UK) operating at a cross-head speed of 0. 5 mm/min and its value at failure determined. Following debond, the site of bond failure and ARI were recorded. Outcome: Force to failure, site of bond failure and adhesive remnant index. Results: The Weibull analysis gave higher values for the force to failure at 5 % level (200 v. 159 N) and at all other levels of probability of failure for the gingivally <b>offset</b> <b>bracket.</b> The non-parametric survival analysis using Gehan–Wilcoxon tests with Breslow’s algorithm (p< 0. 0001) showed significant difference in force to failure between bracket types.

40|$|Utilizing three U. S. Senate {{votes on}} indexation, this article {{statistically}} examines {{the relationship between}} public spending tendencies of legislators and their votes on indexing the tax code. Heretofore, the public finance literature has argued that periodic discretionary tax cuts have offset past inflation-induced bracket creep. A problem with discerning whether discretionary tax cuts <b>offset</b> <b>bracket</b> creep, however, is that one’s conclusion is sensitive to the base year from which one indexes. Looking at public spending tendencies and voting patterns on indexation represents an alternative approach to the issue. If government naturally rebates inflation-induced revenue gains, support for or opposition to indexation would not be associated with senators ’ spending tendencies, since indexation per se would have {{no impact on the}} size of the funded budget. This study shows, however, that the more liberal are senatorial spending tendencies, the greater is the likelihood of opposition to indexation. During the last few years there have been votes in the U. S. ~~ ~ Senate on whether to index the federal income tax. This article uses three of these votes- 1976, 1978, and 1981 -to examine statistically the relationship between senators ’ votes and senators ’ public spending proclivities as measured by the sen-ators ’ scores on the National Taxpayer’s Union (NTU) spending index. This relationship is of interest to those in public finance because it sheds some light on the issue of whether inflation-induced bracket creep is a source of additional federal tax revenue. Although it is often asserted that the level of federal tax revenue is augmented by bracket creep, much of the public finance literature rejects this assertion, suggesting instead that periodic discretionary tax cuts offset inflation-induced bracket creep and obviate the relevance of formal indexation. ’...|$|E
25|$|In August of 1981, after {{negotiations}} with the Republican-controlled Senate and the Democratic-controlled House, Reagan signed the largest marginal tax cut in American history into law at his California ranch. However, the 1981 marginal cuts were partially <b>offset</b> by <b>bracket</b> creep and increased Social Security rates the following year.|$|R
50|$|Extent items {{contain a}} back-reference {{to the tree}} node or file occupying that extent. There may be {{multiple}} back-references if the extent is shared between snapshots. If {{there are too many}} back-references to fit in the item, they spill out into individual extent data reference items. Tree nodes, in turn, have back-references to their containing trees. This makes it possible to find which extents or tree nodes are in any region of space by doing a B-tree range lookup on a pair of <b>offsets</b> <b>bracketing</b> that region, then following the back-references. For relocating data, this allows an efficient upwards traversal from the relocated blocks to quickly find and fix all downwards references to those blocks, without having to walk the entire file system. This, in turn, allows the file system to efficiently shrink, migrate and defragment its storage online.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} year of his administration, Riley {{proposed}} [...] "Amendment One", which would have made swift changes to the state's tax system. The plan essentially consisted of income tax breaks for lower <b>brackets,</b> <b>offset</b> by various tax hikes on consumption, property and income from higher brackets. Part of the problem that this plan sought to address was the strong dependence the Alabama tax system placed upon sales tax, which makes the state budget dependent upon the economy in the state. The plan was estimated to yield an overall state revenue increase of $1.2 billion per year. [...] The plan also included accountability reforms, including changes to teacher tenure policies, accountability for school systems, and bans on pass-through pork. This plan also included provisions for a scholarship program for Alabama students to attend college and funding of other education initiatives.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors {{consider}} the possibility and provide specific solutions to create the automated system of track maintenance on the example of automation of technological operations to restore the equal elasticity of the undersleeper foundation. The relevance of the work {{stems from the fact}} that the modern and perspective requirements to the track maintenance in the conditions of the transition to high-speed, high-speed, high-tonnage traffic can be implemented only by switching to a new system of track maintenance based on the performance of work of specialized high-performance machines and on the new system with maximum opportunity for automation technology. More than half of the volume of works on the current maintenance of the tracks are the works on the removal of splashes, straightening and tamping of track, the technology of which can be divided into two components: calculation-evaluation and the generation of control actions on the railway track. Track machines are used extensively at the local bearing places of the occurrence of splashes on track sections or for continuous bearing plot ways to restore the equal elasticity of the undersleeper base and reduce the degree of non-uniformity deviations in rails’ position on level and in plan, as well as track subsidence. The bunker for filling the ballast may be mounted on additional frame or on <b>offset</b> <b>brackets</b> of the machine. The device for measuring the position of a railway track includes the means for measuring the deflections of the road, bending rise the track in the longitudinal profile and the position of the track on level (elevation of one rail in relation to another) and the adjacent block determining the actual position of a railway track in plan, in longitudinal profile and on level. The block of determining the amount of ballast consists of interconnected devices for determining the value of shifts and raise of the track and the block of comparing the track raise values with determining the amount necessary for filling of ballast. A device for determining the magnitudes of the shifts and the track raise consists of the interconnected unit for comparing the actual position of the track with a given (estimated) position of the track and a block determining the values of the track shifts and raise, which also provides the conversion of the recorded deflections of the track in the longitudinal profile in the track subsidence. The block comparing the track raise values with determining the amount necessary for filling the ballast, compares the magnitude of the track raise, determines changes in the transverse area of a prism in case of track raise and determines the amount needed for ballast filling. It also controls the control unit of the device for filling the ballast. The authors developed and tested the schemes of using the elements of technological processes automation during the operation of hopper dispenser with the track surfacing, which will allow reducing the duration of track possessions and will speed up the track maintenance...|$|R
40|$|In {{the short}} run, the Bush tax cuts {{were one of}} the largest and best-timed uses of fiscal policy in history, helping to prevent a much worse {{downturn}} (but it would have been better still if the tax rate cuts had been immediate and real spending controls enacted simultaneously to take effect well into the economic expansion). In the medium run of five-to-ten years, the CBO projects gradually declining deficits and a debt-GDP ratio that rises slightly to peak at about 40 % in two or three years, and then stabilizes for the rest of the decade through 2014 even as the tax cuts are made permanent, so long as the post- 1998 splurge in non-defense discretionary spending is slowed substantially. This is hardly a debt spiraling out of control. The deficits will reduce domestic investment, but less than dollar-for-dollar. The effect is important, but hardly a cause for hysteria. Of course, President Bushs tax cuts and Senator Kerrys spending increases have ramifications well beyond the next decade, when fiscal pressures will become even more pronounced. In the long run of decades, the deficits in Social Security and Medicare are projected to be much larger than the unified deficit in the next ten years. Standard projections exceed fifty trillion dollars in present value, but may overstate the problem by assuming quite modest long-run annual growth, increases in health care outlays far in excess of GDP growth for the better part of a century (the only way that will happen is if the health benefits are sufficient for citizens to want to spend that much), large real benefit increases in Social Security, and continuous tax cuts to <b>offset</b> real <b>bracket</b> creep and the AMT. But even with less stark projections, there would still be large deficits and large tax increases looming. To avoid them, continuously rigorous spending control and major program reform is essential. ...|$|R
