5|$|Apparently Constantine did not patronize Christianity alone. After gaining {{victory in}} the Battle of the Milvian Bridge (312), a triumphal arch—the Arch of Constantine—was built (315) to {{celebrate}} his triumph. The arch is decorated with images of the goddess Victoria. At {{the time of its}} dedication, sacrifices to gods like Apollo, Diana, and Hercules were made. Absent from the Arch are any depictions <b>of</b> <b>Christian</b> symbolism. However, as the Arch was commissioned by the Senate, the absence <b>of</b> <b>Christian</b> symbols may reflect the role of the Curia at the time as a pagan redoubt.|$|E

Without these truths, the letter said, meditation, which should be a flight from the self, can degenerate into a form of self-absorption.|$|E
