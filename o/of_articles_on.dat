5|$|Castillo Armas' army of 480 men was {{not large}} enough to defeat the Guatemalan military, even with U.S.-supplied aircraft. Therefore, the plans for Operation PBSUCCESS called for a {{campaign}} of psychological warfare, which would present Castillo Armas' victory as a fait accompli to the Guatemalan people, and would force Árbenz to resign. The propaganda campaign had begun well before the invasion, with the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) writing hundreds <b>of</b> <b>articles</b> <b>on</b> Guatemala based on CIA reports, and distributing {{tens of thousands of}} leaflets throughout Latin America. The CIA persuaded friendly governments to screen video footage of Guatemala that supported the U.S. version of events.|$|E
5|$|Fuad Muhammad Syafruddin (18 February 1963– 16 August 1996), {{best known}} by his pen name Udin, was an Indonesian {{journalist}} who {{was murdered in}} 1996. A reporter at the Yogyakarta, Java, daily newspaper Bernas, he published a series <b>of</b> <b>articles</b> <b>on</b> corruption in the Bantul Regency {{in the months before}} his death. On 13 August, he was attacked at his house by two unidentified assailants using a metal rod and taken to the hospital. He died three days later without regaining consciousness.|$|E
5|$|His {{increasing}} interest in mineralogy {{at this time}} is also apparent from the titles of two books he authored between 1803 and 1809. The first was a two volume work that appeared in 1804 entitled A Practical Essay on the Analysis of Minerals, which was reissued in 1808 as A Manual of Analytical Mineralogy. In 1809 he published Analysis of a Course of Lectures on Mineralogy. Beginning in 1808, while at the Surrey Institution, Accum also published, a series <b>of</b> <b>articles</b> <b>on</b> the chemical properties and composition of mineral water in Alexander Tilloch's Philosophical Journal.|$|E

5|$|Bennett {{later became}} an orchardist, {{purchasing}} a property and living at Glenorie in the Hills district on Sydney's North Western fringe, until 1955 when, due to deteriorating health following a coronary occlusion, {{he sold his}} orchard and moved to Dural, New South Wales. He travelled to Singapore in 1957 with his wife to attend {{the opening of the}} Kranji War Memorial and then in 1960, travelled to Japan to meet with officers who had fought in Malaya. He wrote a number <b>of</b> <b>articles</b> <b>on</b> military topics and served on the board of a number of companies. From 1960 to 1962, he was Chairman of Directors of MMI Insurance. He died on 1 August 1962 at Dural, survived by his wife and daughter. After a state funeral at St Andrew's Cathedral, his body was cremated. The diary that Bennett kept while serving in Malaya is held at the State Library of New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland regressed in {{the ensuing}} season, {{finishing}} with a 4–12 record. Edwards and tight end Kellen Winslow Jr., who the Browns had drafted in 2004, put up respectable numbers, but the Browns were close {{to the bottom of}} the league in points scored and offensive yards gained. Frye injured his wrist toward the end of the season and shared starts with quarterback Derek Anderson, who showed promise in the five games he played in. During the season, the team produced a series <b>of</b> <b>articles</b> <b>on</b> its website called 60th Moments. The series commemorated the establishment of the Browns 60 years before in 1946, recapturing the 60 greatest moments in franchise history. Beginning on September 6, 2006, the Browns' site ran articles covering those 60 moments; the final article ran on December 31, 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Grant befriended {{the occult}} artist Austin Osman Spare, and in ensuing years helped to {{publicise}} Spare's artwork {{through a series}} of publications. During the 1950s he also came to be increasingly interested in Hinduism, exploring the teachings of the Hindu guru Ramana Maharshi and publishing a range <b>of</b> <b>articles</b> <b>on</b> the topic. He was particularly interested in the Hindu tantra, incorporating ideas from it into the Thelemic practices of sex magic. On Germer's death in 1969, Grant proclaimed himself Outer Head of the O.T.O.; this title was disputed by the American Grady McMurtry, who took control of the O.T.O. Grant's Order became known as the Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis, operating from his Golders Green home. In 1959 he began publishing on the subject of occultism, and proceeded to author the Typhonian Trilogies, {{as well as a number}} of novels, books of poetry, and publications devoted to propagating the work of Crowley and Spare.|$|E

5|$|In 1971, the Pentagon Papers, {{a secret}} United States Department of Defense {{history of the}} United States' {{political}} and military involvement in the Vietnam War from 1945 to 1967, were given ("leaked") to Neil Sheehan of The New York Times by former State Department official Daniel Ellsberg, with his friend Anthony Russo assisting in copying them. The New York Times began publishing excerpts as a series <b>of</b> <b>articles</b> <b>on</b> June 13. Controversy and lawsuits followed. The papers revealed, among other things, {{that the government had}} deliberately expanded its role in the war by conducting air strikes over Laos, raids along the coast of North Vietnam, and offensive actions taken by U.S. Marines well before the public was told about the actions, all while President Lyndon B. Johnson had been promising not to expand the war. The document increased the credibility gap for the U.S. government, and hurt efforts by the Nixon administration to fight the ongoing war.|$|E
5|$|John Stuart Mill was {{impressed}} by remarks criticising English society that Wallace had included in The Malay Archipelago. Mill asked him to join the general committee of his Land Tenure Reform Association, but the association dissolved after Mill's death in 1873. Wallace had written only a handful <b>of</b> <b>articles</b> <b>on</b> political and social issues between 1873 and 1879 when, {{at the age of}} 56, he entered the debates over trade policy and land reform in earnest. He believed that rural land should be owned by the state and leased to people who would make whatever use of it that would benefit the largest number of people, thus breaking the often-abused power of wealthy landowners in British society.|$|E
5|$|Voluntary {{censorship}} of atomic information began before the Manhattan Project. After {{the start of}} the European war in 1939 American scientists began avoiding publishing military-related research, and in 1940 scientific journals began asking the National Academy of Sciences to clear articles. William L. Laurence of The New York Times, who wrote an article for The Saturday Evening Post in September 1940 on atomic fission, later learned that government officials asked librarians nationwide in 1943 to withdraw the issue. The Soviets noticed the silence, however. In April 1942 nuclear physicist Georgy Flyorov wrote to Josef Stalin on the absence <b>of</b> <b>articles</b> <b>on</b> nuclear fission in American journals; this resulted in the Soviet Union establishing its own atomic bomb project.|$|E

5|$|Explorer Samuel de Champlain was {{the first}} European to record an {{encounter}} with Ottawa speakers when he met a party of three hundred Ottawas in 1615 {{on the north shore}} of Georgian Bay. French missionaries, particularly members of the Society of Jesus and the Récollets order, documented several dialects of Ojibwe in the 17th and 18th centuries, including unpublished manuscript Ottawa grammatical notes, word lists, and a dictionary. In the 19th century, Ottawa speaker Andrew Blackbird wrote a history of the Ottawa people that included a description of Ottawa grammatical features. The first linguistically accurate work was Bloomfield's description of Ottawa as spoken at Walpole Island, Ontario. The Odawa Language Project at the University of Toronto, led by Kaye and Piggott, conducted field work in Ottawa communities on Manitoulin Island in the late 1960s and early 1970s, resulting in a series of reports on Ottawa linguistics. Piggott also prepared a comprehensive description of Ottawa phonology. Rhodes produced a study of Ottawa syntax, a dictionary, and a series <b>of</b> <b>articles</b> <b>on</b> Ottawa grammar. Valentine has published a comprehensive descriptive grammar, a volume of texts including detailed analysis, as well as a survey of Ojibwe dialects that includes extensive description and analysis of Ottawa dialect features.|$|E
