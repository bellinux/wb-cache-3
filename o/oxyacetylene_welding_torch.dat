50|$|A flint spark lighter (sometimes {{just called}} a spark lighter, striker, or flint lighter) {{is a type}} of lighter used in many {{applications}} to safely light a gaseous fuel to start a flame.

25|$|Since {{the melted}} metal flows {{out of the}} workpiece, there must be room on the {{opposite}} side of the workpiece for the spray to exit. When possible, pieces of metal are cut on a grate that lets the melted metal fall freely to the ground. The same equipment can be used for <b>oxyacetylene</b> blowtorches and <b>welding</b> <b>torches,</b> by exchanging the part of the torch in front of the torch valves.|$|R
25|$|Welding lead or 'lead burning' {{was much}} {{more common in the}} 19th century to make some pipe {{connections}} and tanks. Great skill is required but can be quickly learned. In building construction today some lead flashing is welded but soldered copper flashing is much more common in America. In the automotive body collision industry before the 1980s, <b>oxyacetylene</b> gas <b>torch</b> <b>welding</b> was seldom used to weld sheetmetal, since warpage was a byproduct besides the excess heat. Automotive body repair methods at the time were crude and yielded improprieties until MIG welding became the industry standard. Since the 1970s, when high strength steel became the standard for automotive manufacturing, electric welding became the preferred method. After the 1980s, the oxyacetylene torch fell out of use for sheetmetal welding in the industrialized world.|$|R

The results of this study suggests that there appears to be little impact, in terms of gas metal arc welding skills, associated with removing <b>oxyacetylene</b> <b>welding</b> from the curriculum. Because the gas metal arc welding industry is growing globally and industrial technology curricula are under time constraints that often limit the amount of time devoted to welding, faculty should consider suspending oxy-fuel welding to allow more time in gas metal arc welding instruction...|$|R
