5|$|Laurence succeeded Augustine to the see of Canterbury {{in about}} 604, and ruled {{until his death}} on 2February 619. To secure the succession, Augustine had consecrated Laurence before he died, even though that was {{prohibited}} by canon law. Augustine was afraid though that if someone did not step into the office immediately, it would damage the missionary efforts in Britain. However, Laurence never received a pallium from Rome, so {{he may have been}} considered uncanonical by the papacy. Bede makes a point <b>of</b> <b>comparing</b> Augustine's action in consecrating Laurence to Saint Peter's action of consecrating Clement as Bishop of Rome during Peter's lifetime, which the theologian J. Robert Wright believes may be Bede's way of criticising the practices of the church in his day.|$|E

5|$|There is an inherent, {{systemic}} {{problem with}} any metric based on comparing {{with one or}} a few reference translations: in real life, sentences can be translated in many different ways, sometimes with no overlap. Therefore, the approach <b>of</b> <b>comparing</b> by how much any given translation result by a computer differs from just a few human translations is flawed. HyTER is another automated MT metric that compares to very many translations in a reference grammar defined by human translators; the drawback is then that the human effort involved in correctly defining the combinatorially many ways to render the meaning of the translation in practice means HyTER also is only an approximation.|$|E
5|$|The NTFS {{file system}} used by recent {{versions}} of Windows stores the file with a UTC time stamp, but displays it corrected to local—or seasonal—time. However, the FAT filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time. Consequently, when a file is copied {{from the hard}} disk onto separate media, its time will be set to the current local time. If the time adjustment is changed, the timestamps of the original file and the copy will be different. The same effect can be observed when compressing and uncompressing files with some file archivers. It is the NTFS file that changes seen time. This effect {{should be kept in}} mind when trying to determine if a file is a duplicate of another, although there are other methods <b>of</b> <b>comparing</b> files for equality (such as using a checksum algorithm).|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} R. A. Markus {{suggests that}} the reason for the conflicting advice is that the letter to Æthelberht was written first, and sent off with the returning missionaries. Markus argues that the pope, after thinking further about the circumstances of the mission in Britain, then sent a follow-up letter, the Epistolae ad Mellitum, to Mellitus, then en route to Canterbury, which contained new instructions. Markus sees this as a turning point in missionary history, in that forcible conversion gave way to persuasion. This traditional view that the Epistola represents a contradiction of the letter to Æthelberht has been challenged by George Demacopoulos who argues that the letter to Æthelberht was mainly meant to encourage the king in spiritual matters, while the Epistola was sent to deal with purely practical matters, and thus the two do not contradict each other. Flora Spiegel, a writer on Anglo-Saxon literature, {{suggests that the}} theme <b>of</b> <b>comparing</b> the Anglo-Saxons to the Israelites was part of a conversion strategy involving gradual steps, including an explicitly proto-Jewish one between paganism and Christianity. Spiegel sees this as an extension of Gregory's view of Judaism as halfway between Christianity and paganism. Thus, Gregory felt that first the Anglo-Saxons must be brought up to the equivalent of Jewish practices, then after that stage was reached they could be brought completely up to Christian practices.|$|E

5|$|The plan of Salisbury Cathedral is {{that most}} often {{reproduced}} in architectural histories for the purpose <b>of</b> <b>comparing</b> English Gothic architecture with that of France, Italy and other countries. It has many features that, on paper at least, are typical. The plan of Worcester Cathedral, for example, closely resembles that of Salisbury. Both have two transepts, a large central tower, a large porch to {{the north side of}} the nave, a cloister to the south, off which opens a polygonal chapter house. Internally, there are also strong visual similarities in the simple lancet windows of the east end and the contrasting profusion of Purbeck marble shafts. But the histories of the two buildings are very different. Salisbury Cathedral took 160 years to complete, from its foundations in 1220 to the top of its massive spire in 1380. Worcester took 420 years from its Norman crypt of 1084 to its chapel in memory of Prince Arthur in 1504. The history of Worcester is much more representative of the history of most of England’s medieval cathedrals than is that of Salisbury.|$|E

The psychological process of cost-benefit comparisons helps the person to assess and justify the feasibility (spending money) of an economic decision, and is the basis for determining if the benefit outweighs the cost, and to what extent.

25|$|Jung {{was fond}} <b>of</b> <b>comparing</b> {{the form of}} the {{archetype}} to the axial system of a crystal, which preforms the crystalline structure of the mother liquid, although it has no material existence of its own. This first appears according to the specific way in which the ions and molecules aggregate. The archetype in itself is empty and purely formal: a possibility of representation which is given a priori. The representations themselves are not inherited, only the forms, and in that respect they correspond to the instincts. The existence of the instincts can no more be proved than the existence of the archetypes, so long as they do not manifest themselves concretely.|$|E
25|$|The {{comparative}} method, {{the staple}} method of reconstructing a proto-language or ancestor {{of a group}} of languages apparently related because of similarities in the tree model of historical linguistics, has been enhanced by the application of the phylogenetic method.

In biology, the goal <b>of</b> <b>comparing</b> genetic sequences is to determine the percentage of similarity between the chromosomes of two species; they may then be hypothesized to have branched from each other on the tree at a time consistent with the rate of change of each. In linguistic phylogenetic comparisons, the desired result is a percentage of similarity between languages from which a tree structure may be reconstructed. Each branch, or level, represents a proto-language.|$|E

Bomhard recognized {{the necessity to}} explore morphological comparisons and has since published extensive {{work in this area}} (see especially Bomhard 2008:1.273–386). According to him the breakthrough came with the publication of the first volume of Joseph Greenberg's Eurasiatic work, which provided a massive list of possible morphemic correspondences that has proved fruitful to explore. Other important contributions on Nostratic morphology have been published by John C. Kerns and Vladimir Dybo.|$|E
25|$|Fingerprint identification, {{known as}} dactyloscopy, or hand print identification, {{is the process}} <b>of</b> <b>comparing</b> two {{instances}} of friction ridge skin impressions (see Minutiae), from human fingers or toes, or even the palm of the hand or sole of the foot, to determine whether these impressions {{could have come from}} the same individual. The flexibility of friction ridge skin means that no two finger or palm prints are ever exactly alike in every detail; even two impressions recorded immediately after each other from the same hand may be slightly different. Fingerprint identification, also referred to as individualization, involves an expert, or an expert computer system operating under threshold scoring rules, determining whether two friction ridge impressions are likely to have originated from the same finger or palm (or toe or sole).|$|E
25|$|The human OFC {{is among}} the least-understood regions of the human brain; {{but it has been}} {{proposed}} that the OFC is involved in sensory integration, in representing the affective value of reinforcers, and in decision-making and expectation. In particular, the OFC seems to be important in signaling the expected rewards/punishments of an action given the particular details of a situation. In doing this, the brain is capable <b>of</b> <b>comparing</b> the expected reward/punishment with the actual delivery of reward/punishment, thus, making the OFC critical for adaptive learning. This is supported by research in humans, non-human primates, and rodents. Human research has focused on neuroimaging research in healthy participants and neuropsychology research in patients with damage to discrete parts of the OFC. Research at the University of Leipzig shows that the human OFC is activated during intuitive coherence judgements.|$|E
