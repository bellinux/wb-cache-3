60|$|They soon {{hit upon}} an ingenious device, however--but not {{altogether}} new among seamen--to allay {{the severity of}} the depression under which they languished. Ropes were unstranded, and the yarns picked apart; and, cut up into small bits, were used as a substitute for the weed. <b>Old</b> <b>ropes</b> were preferred; especially those which had long lain in the hold, and had contracted an epicurean dampness, making still richer their ancient, cheese-like flavor.|$|E

In front lay the brown leaves of last year, and upon them some yellowish-green ones of this season that had been prematurely blown down by the gale. Above stretched an old beech, with vast armpits, and great pocket-holes in its sides where branches had been amputated in past times; a black slug was trying to climb it. Dead boughs were scattered about like ichthyosauri in a museum, and beyond them were perishing woodbine stems resembling <b>old</b> <b>ropes.</b>|$|E

[...] So I groped my way down into the forecastle, which smelt so bad of <b>old</b> <b>ropes</b> and tar, that it almost made me sick. After waiting patiently, I began to see a little; and looking round, at last perceived I was in a smoky looking place, with twelve wooden boxes stuck round the sides. In some of these boxes were large chests, which I at once supposed {{to belong to the}} sailors, who must have taken that method of appropriating their [...] "Trunks," [...] as I afterward found these boxes were called. And so it turned out.|$|E
60|$|By {{reason of}} his incessant watchfulness and unaccountable {{bachelor}} oddities, {{it was very}} difficult for him to retain in his employment the various sailors who, from time to time, were billeted with him to do the duty of subalterns. In particular, he was always desirous of having at least one steady, faultless young man, of a literary taste, to keep an eye to his account-books, and swab out the armoury every morning. It was an odious business this, to be immured all day in such a bottomless hole, among tarry <b>old</b> <b>ropes</b> and villainous guns and pistols. It was with peculiar dread that I one day noticed the goggle-eyes of Old Revolver, as they called him, fastened upon me with a fatal glance of good-will and approbation. He had somehow heard of my being a very learned person, who could both read and write with extraordinary facility; and moreover that I was a rather reserved youth, who kept his modest, unassuming merits in the background. But though, from the keen sense of my situation as a man-of-war's-man all this about my keeping myself in the back ground was true enough, yet I had no idea of hiding my diffident merits under ground. I became alarmed at the old Yeoman's goggling glances, lest he should drag me down into tarry perdition in his hideous store-rooms. But this fate was providentially averted, owing to mysterious causes which I never could fathom.|$|E

50|$|The new route {{provided}} a better route from Leeds and Wakefield to Hull, {{although it was}} a similar length to the route via the lower Aire, but considerably reduced the distance from Leeds to York. The port at Airmyn on the lower Aire closed in early 1779, and 8 acre of land were leased at Selby, on which to build port facilities and warehouses. Staithes were built in 1781 and 1782, and 1782 also saw the construction of a counting house, a warehouse, a rigging house, a tarring house, a sailmaker's shop, a crane and a repository for <b>old</b> <b>ropes.</b> Two cranes were erected in 1787, one on the canal and the other on the river, while an extra lock-keeper had to be employed in 1788 because of the volume of trade. Ten years later, John Foster built a private dry dock at Selby, where many of the boats of the Aire and Calder were repaired.|$|E
50|$|The {{admiralty}} rope-works {{was established}} at Oostenburg and was approximately 300 meters in length.

50|$|Ballinger has led clients up Everest, Manaslu, Lhotse, Ama Dablam, Cho Oyu, and Makalu. During the 2010 {{climbing}} {{season on}} Mt. Everest, Ballinger summited the mountain twice in 3 weeks, first on May 5 {{and then again}} on May 22. On his May 5 summit, Ballinger was the first non-sherpa of the season to summit as he fixed ropes, replaced anchors, and removed <b>old</b> <b>ropes</b> from the mountain in partnership with 9 sherpa. Also in 2010, Ballinger led an Alpenglow Expeditions Clean Up Expedition on Ama Dablam. This team, along with summitting the mountain, removed thousands of feet of old fixed rope from the route, along with hundreds of pounds of trash from the camps. They also provided outreach to sherpa and members of other climbing teams to teach the use of human waste disposal kits while on the mountain, and donated human waste disposal bags to many of those teams. In 2011, he repeated his feat of summiting Everest twice (May 5 and May 20) {{in only a few}} weeks and added his first summit of Lhotse (May 26) to that schedule as well. Ballinger has led successful expeditions to more than 25 Himalayan summits over 6000 meters, including twelve ascents of Ama Dablam, which is a highly technical 6800m peak next to Everest. Since 2007, he has guided clients to the summit of Everest 6 times, Manaslu 4 times, and Cho Oyu and Lhotse once each. He has also led an expedition to Makalu, the world's fifth tallest peak.|$|E

5000|$|Robert Benjamin Lewis held three United States patents, {{making him}} one of the few nineteenth century African American inventors who were able to patent their inventions or {{improvements}} to existing manufacturing processes. In his application for a United States Patent dated April 11, 1836, Lewis stated that “I, Robert Benjamin Lewis of Hallowell, in the county of Kennebec, and state of Maine, have invented a new and useful machine for the picking of oakum and hair.” “Oakum” is defined as “loosely twisted hemp or jute fiber impregnated with tar or a tar derivative.” During the days of the sailing ship, hemp ropes were used as rigging on board. Although coated with pine tar and varnish, the coating would eventually wear out and the rigging would have to be replaced. Since little was wasted, the <b>old</b> <b>rope</b> would be recycled by unraveling the strands until the rope itself was reduced to single threads and then loosely rewound, resulting in “oakum,” which was used to caulk the seams of wooden ships in order to make them watertight. “Picking oakum”—the actual business in unraveling the strands of rope so that they could be prepared for caulking—was a tedious, sticky job generally delegated to those workers lowest in the pecking order. The machine would do the work of the picker—essentially teeth on a cylinder turned by a crank would separate the strands of the <b>old</b> <b>rope</b> to produce oakum. The patent was awarded on June 25, 1836 [...] The “hair picker” became a mainstay of Maine shipyards, the original design being reworked and refined over the years.|$|R

5000|$|The ends of {{the rope}} are first wrapped in tape or heated with a flame to prevent each end from fraying completely. The rope is unlayed for a {{distance}} equal to three times the diameter for each [...] "tuck", e.g., for five tucks in half inch rope, undo about 7.5 inches. Wrap the rope at that point to prevent it unwinding further. Form the loop and plait the three ends back against the twist of the rope. Practice is required to keep each end to retain its twist and lie neatly. In stiff <b>old</b> <b>rope</b> or in new rope which has been tightly wound, a marlinspike or fid can facilitate opening up the strands and threading each end.|$|R
