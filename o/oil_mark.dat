40|$|The Third Workshop on Geothermal Reservoir Engineering convened at Stanford University on December 14, 1977, with 104 {{attendees}} {{from six}} nations. In {{keeping with the}} recommendations expressed by the participants at the Second Workshop, {{the format of the}} Workshop was retained, with three days of technical sessions devoted to reservoir physics, well and reservoir testing, field development, and mathematical modeling of geothermal reservoirs. The program presented 33 technical papers, summaries of which are included in these Proceedings. Although the format of the Workshop has remained constant, it is clear from a perusal of the Table of Contents that considerable advances have occurred in all phases of geothermal reservoir engineering over the past three years. Greater understanding of reservoir physics and mathematical representations of vapor-dominated and liquid-dominated reservoirs are evident; new techniques for their analysis are being developed, and significant field data from a number of newer reservoirs are analyzed. The objectives of these workshops have been to bring together researchers active in the various physical and mathematical disciplines comprising the field of geothermal reservoir engineering, to give the participants a forum for review of progress and exchange of new ideas in this rapidly developing field, and to summarize the effective state of the art of geothermal reservoir engineering in a form readily useful to the many government and private agencies involved in the development of geothermal energy. To these objectives, the Third Workshop and these Proceedings have been successfully directed. Several important events in this field have occurred since the Second Workshop in December 1976. The first among these was the incorporation of the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) into the newly formed Department of Energy (DOE) which continues as the leading Federal agency in geothermal reservoir engineering research. The Third Workshop under the Stanford Geothermal Program was {{supported by a grant from}} DOE through a subcontract with the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory of the University of California. A second significant event was the first conference under the ERDA (DOE) -ENEL cooperative program where many of the results of well testing in both nations were discussed. The Proceedings of that conference should be an important contribution to the literature. These Proceedings of the Third Workshop should also make an important contribution to the literature on geothermal reservoir engineering. Much of the data presented at the Workshop were given for the first time, and full technical papers on these subjects will appear in the professional journals. The results of these studies will assist markedly in developing the research programs to be supported by the Federal agencies, and in reducing the costs of research for individual developers and utilities. It is expected that future workshops of the Stanford Geothermal Program will be as successful as this third one. Planning and execution of the Workshop [...] . [see file; ljd, 10 / 3 / 2005] The Program Committee recommended two novel sessions for the Third Workshop, both of which were included in the program. The first was the three overviews given at the Workshop by George Pinder (Princeton) on the Academic aspect, James Bresee (DOE-DGE) on the Government aspect, and Charles Morris (Phillips Petroleum) on the Industry aspect. These constituted the invited slate of presentations from the several sectors of the geothermal community. The Program Committee acknowledges their contributions with gratitude. Recognition of the importance of reservoir assurance in opting for geothermal resources as an alternate energy source for electric energy generation resulted in a Panel Session on Various Definitions of Geothermal Reservoirs. Special acknowledgments are offered to Jack Howard and Werner Schwarz (LBL) and to Jack Howard as moderator; to the panelists: James Leigh (Lloyd's Bank of California), Stephen Lipman (Union <b>Oil),</b> <b>Mark</b> Mathisen (PG&E), Patrick Muffler (USGS-MP), and Mark Silverman (DOE-SAN); and to the rapporteurs: George Frye (Aminoil), Vasel Roberts (Electrical Power Research Institute), and Alexander Graf (LBL), whose Valuable summaries are included in the Proceedings. Special thanks are also due Roland Horne, Visiting Professor from New Zealand and Program Manager of the Stanford Geothermal Program, for his efforts with the Program graduate students in conducting the Workshop. Further thanks go to Marion Wachtel, who in spite of tremendous personal hardship, administered the Workshop and prepared the Proceedings in a timely and professional manner. Professor Ramey and I also express our appreciation to the Department of Energy, whose financial support of the Workshop made possible the program and these Proceedings.

40|$|Pathohistologic {{changes in}} various organs of eels kept for 14 days in water tanks {{containing}} crude oil {{with and without}} various oil detergents were studied. The results were: 1. Eels kept in water containing crude <b>oil</b> showed <b>marked</b> degeneration of proximal renal tubules. There was some regeneration of tubular epithelial cells {{and an increase in}} hemosiderin-like substance in the interstitial tissue of the kidney and spleen, suggesting accelerated hemolysis. The increased deposition of hemosiderin-like substance seemed to be due to hemolytic activity of the benzine, toluene and xylene contained in crude <b>oil.</b> No <b>marked</b> changes were seen in the liver, gills, muscle, intestine or other organs examined. 2. Eels exposed to oil detergents also showed kidney damage, tubular necrosis and regeneration. Increased deposition of hemosiderin-like granules was evident. The activated hemolysis seemed to be due to cytolytic activity of the surface active agents. 3. In the cases where crude oil was given with oil detergents pathologic changes were most marked. Severe degeneration of the proximal renal tubules was observed with poor regeneration of the epithelial cells. These severe changes may be due to accelerated migration of crude oil components into the fish body by oil detergents rather than to synergistic effects of the agents and crude oil. 4. Of the substances contained in crude oil those that are known to penetrate into the living body are, in the mammal, all liver-damaging but not kidney damaging.

40|$|The paper {{includes}} {{an assessment of}} the tribological properties of mineral and synthetic Lotos <b>oil</b> <b>marked</b> SAE 15 W/ 40 and SAE 5 W/ 40 at ambient temperature and 100 ̊C. The evaluation was based on the analysis of the tribological properties of friction couple consumables. Tribological tests were performed using the Anton Paar THT 1000 high temperature tribotester according to ASTM G 133. Tribological properties were investigated using the “ball on disc” method. The change of friction coefficient, friction couple temperature, volume wear of samples and counter-samples and Hertz stresses were evaluated. In addition, hardness tests of the friction couple materials as well as surface roughness before and after friction were performed. On the basis of tribological studies, it was noted that Lotos Synthetic 5 W/ 40 oil has better cooling properties compared. For both oils the coefficient of friction was lower at ambient temperature than at 100 ̊C. The highest value of volume wear of the sample was noted for the combination lubricated with Mineral Oil 15 W/ 40 at 100 ̊C (0. 0143 mm 3) while for counter-sample lubricated with synthetic oil at ambient temperature (0. 0039 mm 3). The highest sample wear coefficient was recorded for the mineral oil lubricated at temperature of 100 ̊C (3. 585 * 10 - 7 mm 3 /N/m) while for counter-sample lubricated with synthetic oil at ambient temperature (9. 8768 * 10 - 8 mm 3 /N/m).
