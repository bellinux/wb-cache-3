Public Enemy responded to this and other deep-rooted problems <b>of</b> <b>Black</b> <b>America</b> on their following album, Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black (1991), which featured more critical assessments of African-Americans, denouncing Black drug dealers who donned Afrocentric merchandise, hip hop artists who promoted malt liquor, black radio stations for lacking significant airplay to hip hop, and even the Africans {{at the onset of}} the Atlantic slave trade for lacking unity.|$|E

25|$|On May 24, 1963, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy invited African-American novelist James Baldwin, {{along with}} {{a large group of}} {{cultural}} leaders, to a meeting in New York to discuss race relations. However, the meeting became antagonistic, as black delegates felt that Kennedy did not have a full understanding of the race problem in the nation. The public failure of the meeting, which {{came to be known as}} the Baldwin–Kennedy meeting, underscored the divide between the needs <b>of</b> <b>Black</b> <b>America</b> and the understanding of Washington politicians. However, the meeting also provoked the Kennedy administration to take action on the civil rights for African-Americans. On June 11, 1963, President John F. Kennedy gave his famous civil rights address on national television and radio, announcing that he would begin to push for civil rights legislation—the law which eventually became the Civil Rights Act of 1964. That night, Mississippi activist Medgar Evers was murdered in his own driveway, further escalating national tension around the issue of racial inequality.|$|E

Pomerantz (2005), who used Chamberlain {{as a metaphor for}} the uprising <b>of</b> <b>Black</b> <b>America.</b> In addition to Chamberlain's regular-season accomplishments, he scored 42 points in the 1962 NBA All-Star Game, still the all-time record. In the 1962 NBA Playoffs, the Warriors met the Boston Celtics again in the Eastern Division Finals, a team which Bob Cousy and Bill Russell called the greatest Celtics team of all time. Each team won their home games, so the series was split at three after six games. In a closely contested Game 7, Chamberlain tied the game at 107 with 16 seconds to go, but Celtics shooting guard Sam Jones hit a clutch shot with two seconds left to win the series for Boston. In later years, Chamberlain was criticized for averaging 50 points, but not winning a title. In his defense, Warriors coach Frank McGuire said [...] "Wilt has been simply super-human", and pointed out that the Warriors lacked a consistent second scorer, a playmaker, and a second big man to take pressure off Chamberlain.|$|E

2500|$|When McKenzie {{arrived at}} Fisk in 1915, {{nearly half the}} student body was {{enrolled}} in pre-college courses, and while that population decreased throughout his tenure, Fisk still taught high school classes well into the 1920s.

Blacks from racially progressive cities in the North lived with counterparts from staunchly racist communities in the South, where racial violence was a constant threat.

[...] Students arriving at Fisk were [...] "sifted" [...] based on their scholastic aptitude, and placed in classes commensurate with their ability. At the end of each quarter they were reclassified based on their performance. By minimizing the bi-modal distribution of academic ability within classes, course instructors could more effectively target the learning needs of students and help ensure that Fisk graduates could [...] "compete on an even basis in the most rigid colleges of the land." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} churches hold {{interfaith}} Seders where Jews and non-Jews alike {{are invited to}} share in the story and discuss common themes of peace, freedom, and religious tolerance. [...] It should be noted these themes are only peripherally referenced in a traditional Jewish Seder. During the American civil rights movement of the 1960s, interfaith Seders energized and inspired leaders from various communities who came together to march for equal protection for all. The first of these, the Freedom Seder, was written by Arthur Waskow, published in Ramparts magazine and in a small booklet by the Micah Press and in a later edition (1970) by Holt-Rinehart-Winston, and was actually performed on April 4, 1969, {{the first anniversary of the}} death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.and the third night of Passover, at Lincoln Memorial Temple in Washington, DC. It celebrated the liberation struggle <b>of</b> <b>Black</b> <b>America</b> alongside that of ancient Israel from Pharaoh, and was the first Haggadah to go beyond the original Biblical story. It sparked a large number of Haggadahs celebrating various other forms of liberation—feminism, vegetarianism, the liberation movements in Latin America in the 1970s, ecological healing, etc.. [...] Today, many Unitarian Universalist congregations (a liberal religion that encompasses many faith traditions) hold annual interfaith community Seders. A number of Interfaith Passover Seder Haggadahs have been written especially for this purpose.|$|E
2500|$|The Black Belt of Chicago was {{the chain}} of neighborhoods on the South Side of Chicago where three-quarters of the city's African American {{population}} lived by the mid-20th century. [...] In the early 1940's whites within residential blocks formed [...] "restrictive covenants" [...] which served as legal contracts restricting individual owners from renting or selling to black people. The contracts limited the housing available to black tenants, leading to the accumulation of black residents within The Black Belt, {{one of the few}} neighborhoods open to black tenants. The Black Belt was an area that stretched 30 blocks along State Street on the South Side and was rarely more than seven blocks wide. With such a large population within this confined area, overcrowding often lead to numerous families living in old and dilapidated buildings. The South Side's [...] "black belt" [...] also contained zones related to economic status. The poorest residents lived in the northernmost, oldest section of the black belt, while the elite resided in the southernmost section. In the mid-20th century, as African Americans across the United States struggled against the economic confines created by segregation, black residents within the Black Belt sought to create more economic opportunity in their community through the encouragement of local black businesses and entrepreneurs. During this time, Chicago was the capital <b>of</b> <b>Black</b> <b>America.</b> Many African Americans who moved to the Black Belt area of Chicago were from the Black Belt in the Southeastern region of the United States.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1920s, the New Negro Movement {{represented}} a [...] "race-conscious, assertive, race-proud" [...] generation of Black Americans who rejected White paternalism and White run Black colleges. The growing prominence of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association, and the Niagara Movement helped foment Black discontent with prevailing social conditions. Black soldiers, after fighting {{for democracy in}} World War I, returned home and resented the lack of democratic processes afforded them. Increased Black geographic mobility, especially to the North, and better economic opportunities furthered feelings of Black empowerment. Social changes in broader U.S. society also contributed to growing Black self-determination. Throughout the 1920s, the United States experienced what one historian characterized as a, [...] "revolution in morals and manners," [...] especially among both White and Black youth. The religious piety that had long served {{as a basis for}} personal and social customs gave way to motivations for pleasure, wealth, and the nouveau. Emerging technologies such as the automobile, motion pictures, and musical recordings combined with bold new expressions in women's fashion and behavior that seeded growing antagonism toward outdated and overly conservative aspects of life. Improvements in dissemination of news and culture provided many Blacks views of the world outside the South. The rise of Harlem, New York, as the capital <b>of</b> <b>Black</b> <b>America</b> and the flowering of Negro arts, including music and literature, attracted considerable attention among Blacks and Whites. Black advancement on so many different fronts encouraged Black youth to throw off the shackles of compromise and accommodation and boldly assert the rights and privileges promised them as citizens of the United States. There was a White backlash to New Negro movement. Influenced by the proponents of scientific racism and eugenics, many Americans considered Blacks intellectually inferior and resented their growing self-determination and empowerment.|$|E
