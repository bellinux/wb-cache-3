5|$|A handful <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> the Sugar Bowl, Tech wide {{receiver}} Ricky Hall broke a {{bone in his}} foot during practice and was considered unlikely to play. Hall was Tech's second-leading receiver, having caught 25passes for 398yards and three touchdowns. In addition, Hall was the Hokies' starting punt returner, and had returned 40kicks for 510yards and one touchdown, setting a school record for punt return yardage.|$|E
5|$|A couple <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> the Varsity Match, talk in {{the press}} had been of Geen's likely {{selection}} for England for the forthcoming Home Nations Championship. Geen and Poulton, who together were considered the scoring force of the Oxford team, were both selected to play for England in the second trial match against The North in Leeds. Although Geen scored a try in the game, his form was lacking and he was outshone by Poulton. So for {{the third and final}} trial, England versus The Rest on 7 January 1911, Geen was not selected.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{strategic}} importance, the castle and the defences of the Thames and Medway were badly neglected during the 17th century. The Dutch Republic mounted an unexpected naval raid in June 1667, and the Dutch fleet {{was able to}} breach the defences, capturing two warships and burning others at anchor in the river at Chatham, {{in one of the}} worst defeats suffered by the Royal Navy. Upnor Castle acquitted itself better than many of the other defensive sites along the upper Medway, despite its lack of provisioning. Gun fire from the fort and from adjoining emplacements forced a Dutch retreat after a couple <b>of</b> <b>days,</b> <b>before</b> they were able to burn the dockyard itself.|$|E

5|$|Primarily nocturnal, nursehounds {{spend the}} day inside small holes in rocks and swim into deeper water at night to hunt. Sometimes two sharks will squeeze into the same hole, and several {{individuals}} will seek out refuges within the same local area. In one tracking study, a single immature nursehound was observed to use five different refuges in succession {{over a period of}} 168 days, consistently returning to each one over a number <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> moving on. Nursehounds may occupy refuges to hide from predators, avoid harassment by mature conspecifics, and/or to facilitate thermoregulation. In captivity, these sharks are gregarious and tend to rest in groups, though the individuals comprising any particular group changes frequently. This species is less common than the small-spotted catshark.|$|E
5|$|A list of {{necessary}} equipment was compiled by 1 August and included, among other things, massive cables, capstans, pulleys, and 40 pounds of tallow for lubrication. The proposed salvage team comprised 30 Venetian mariners and a Venetian carpenter with 60 English sailors to serve them. The two ships {{to be used}} as hulks were Jesus of Lübeck and Samson, each of 700tons burthen and similar in size to the Mary Rose. Brandon was so confident of success that he reassured the king that it would only be a matter <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> they could raise the Mary Rose. The optimism proved unfounded. Since the ship had settled at a 60-degree angle to starboard much of it was stuck deep into the clay of the seabed. This made it virtually impossible to pass cables under the hull and required far more lifting power than if the ship had settled on a hard seabed. An attempt to secure cables to the main mast appears only to have resulted in its being snapped off.|$|E
5|$|The combat that peasant men {{had engaged}} in prior to the revolt was {{restricted}} to the vicinity in which they lived. During armed conflicts, they would often fight for a short amount <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> returning to cultivate their lands, which remained their main preoccupation. When their service was needed, they were commanded by a local chief who in turn was subordinate to a regional leader. Most armed conflict revolved around the chiefs' bids for local influence and control or protection of villages from Bedouin plundering. There were also instances where peasant fighters would be assembled to back Ottoman authority {{in the face of}} local or external challengers, such as during the 1799 Napoleonic invasion, or against Ottoman authority when it interfered in the unofficial local autonomy that was enjoyed in the mountain regions. In most of the conflicts in which the peasant fighters participated, they fought alongside their kinsmen or neighbors.|$|E

5|$|The period did {{lead to some}} {{reform of}} {{internal}} Society statutes, such as in 1823 and 1831. The most important change there was the requirement that the Treasurer publish an annual report, along {{with a copy of}} the total income and expenditure of the Society. These were to be sent to Fellows at least 14 days before the general meeting, with the intent being to ensure the election of competent Officers by making it readily apparent what existing Officers were doing. This was accompanied by a full list of Fellows standing for Council positions, where previously the names had only been announced a couple <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before.</b> As with the other reforms, this helped ensure that Fellows had a chance to vet and properly consider candidates. The Society's financial troubles were finally resolved in 1850, when a government grant-in-aid of £1,000 a year was accepted. This was increased to £4,000 in 1876, with the Society officially acting merely as the trustee for these funds, doling them out to individual scientists. This grant has now grown to over £47million, some £37million of which is to support around 370 fellowships and professorships.|$|E

25|$|Licinius encamped {{his army}} at Adrianople (Hadrianopolis), the major city of inland Thrace.

Licinius arranged his battle line, of 200 stades in length, in a strong position between a height overlooking the town and the confluence of the Hebrus with a tributary. The two armies remained in position for a number <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> battle was joined, as both sides were reluctant to chance the crossing of the river against a well-prepared and battle-arrayed enemy.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} Red Guard fighters in Länkipohja is unknown, but most likely {{there was about}} 1,000 Reds.

The Red Guards came from the nearby villages of Längelmäki, Jämsä and Orivesi, and from the southern Finland from Urjala, Hämeenlinna, Tuusula, Kerava, Mäntsälä, Espoo and Helsinki. The Helsinki Red Guard had sent its famous A-komppania (the ″A Company″). It {{was one of the}} Red elite units, composed of strength sports athletes and gymnasts.|$|E

25|$|With {{one point}} in hand, Lyon {{traveled}} to Munich to take on group leaders Bayern, who defeated Steaua București 1–0 on the opening matchday. With both teams coming off unimpressive matches a couple <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> (Lyon an unspectacular 2–1 victory over Nancy and Bayern, a 0–1 loss away to Hannover 96), the match showed why with Lyon's only goal coming off the head of Bayern defender Martín Demichelis in the 25th minute from one of Juninho's spot-kicks. Bayern later equalised through Zé Roberto in the second half. Though Lyon had decent chances, including one where Karim Benzema {{had a chance to}} capitalize on a Bayern mistake late in the second half, the match remained 1–1 with Lyon leaving Munich with just two points through two matches.|$|E
25|$|After {{arriving}} in India on 8 July 1947, Radcliffe was given just five weeks {{to decide on}} a border. He soon met with his fellow college alumnus Mountbatten and travelled to Lahore and Calcutta to meet with commission members, chiefly Nehru from the Congress and Jinnah, president of the Muslim League. He objected to the short time frame, but all parties were insistent that the line be finished by the 15 August British withdrawal from India. Mountbatten had accepted the post as Viceroy {{on the condition of}} an early deadline. The decision was completed just a couple <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> the withdrawal, but due to political manoeuvring, not published until 17 August 1947, two days after the grant of independence to India and Pakistan.|$|E

After a very volatile marriage to Illeana, during which Stan dug a grave with the intention of burying his wife in it, he and Illeana separated in 1939 and divorced in 1940, with Illeana surrendering all claim to the Laurel surname on 1 February 1940, in exchange for $6,500.

25|$|Wynter {{embarked}} from Melbourne on 15 May 1940 {{with the}} advance party of I Corps with orders {{to establish a}} base organisation in the Middle East but the convoy he was travelling with was diverted to the United Kingdom. Up until a couple <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> it arrived, the convoy had been {{under the command of}} Brigadier Leslie Morshead of the 18th Infantry Brigade but on 18 April, Wynter discovered that the Military Board back in Australia had promoted him to major general and appointed him to command the AIF in the United Kingdom. Wynter decided that, given the immediate danger of a German invasion of the United Kingdom, his force had to be ready to fight. He therefore reorganised the troops available to form a second infantry brigade. The 18th Infantry Brigade became the Southern Command Striking Force, with {{a key role in the}} defence of southern England. However, the anticipated invasion did not eventuate.|$|E
25|$|She {{was sold}} in 1890 to W. A. Ritchie, of Sydney, and was {{converted}} to a four masted barque by removing her boilers and engines. In 1895 the barque was sold onto G J Robertson of Sydney.

In 1912 the vessel caught fire and burnt for a number <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> flames could be extinguished. The burnt hulk of the vessel was then purchased in 1915, by George Butler, {{the son of the}} first European resident of Magnetic Island. Butler had the hull stripped, and an attempt was made to float the vessel to Magnetic Island′s Picnic Bay, where she would be scuttled to provide a breakwater for a jetty.
