5|$|Rural non-Interstate {{highways}} {{are particularly}} risky. Most are two-lane non-divided highways built to lower standards than Interstate highways.

5|$|Frank, {{the eldest}} of four children, was raised in an Italian-American {{household}} where Italian was often spoken by his grandparents. The family moved often because his father, a chemist and mathematician, worked in the defense industry. After a time in Florida in the 1940s, the family returned to Maryland, where Zappa's father worked at the Edgewood Arsenal chemical warfare facility of the Aberdeen Proving Ground. Due to their home's proximity to the arsenal, which stored mustard gas, gas masks were kept in the home in case <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident.</b> This {{had a profound effect}} on Zappa, and references to germs, germ warfare and the defense industry occur throughout his work.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Rindt {{switched}} to Formula Junior {{with the assistance}} of Kurt Bardi-Barry, a wealthy owner of a travel agency and one of Austria's leading drivers at the time; Barry gave him his one-year-old Cooper T67 and the two men formed a partnership, driving to races together. Rindt was fastest in practice for his first race in Vallelunga, a race won by Barry, and took victory in his second at Cesenatico. In the race, Rindt had taken advantage <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> in the early stages. While most drivers slowed for the incoming ambulance, he raced ahead between the straw barriers and the parked medical vehicle to take the lead. At the time, he was notorious for his dangerous style, almost crashing into the spectators at a race in the streets of Budapest.|$|E

5|$|She, Charlie (Kirk Acevedo), and Lincoln (Seth Gabel) {{are called}} to the scene <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> where a {{pedestrian}} has been {{run over by a}} bus, nearly duplicating events of a similar bus accident the day before, a statistical impossibility according to Astrid (Jasika Nicole). Olivia finds a ball-point pen at the scene, a rarity in the parallel universe because of the adoption of digital interfaces. Evidence suggests that the discovery of the pen by a bystander created a sequence of reactions that led to the victim's death. The next day, another pedestrian is wounded in a bus accident. As the Fringe team investigates the scene, finding another pen, a bystander is struck and killed by an ambulance. Olivia spots a suspicious man in the crowds, but he uses a seemingly random series of happenstance events to get away.|$|E
5|$|Ted Kennedy was 30 {{years old}} when he first entered the Senate {{following}} a November 1962 special election to fill the vacant seat previously held by his brother, John, who was now the President. He was elected to a full six-year term in 1964 and was later re-elected seven more times. The Chappaquiddick incident in 1969 resulted in the death of his automobile passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne. Kennedy pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving the scene <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> and later received a two-month suspended sentence. The incident and its aftermath hindered his chances of ever becoming President. His only attempt, in the 1980 election, resulted in a Democratic primary campaign loss to incumbent President Jimmy Carter, who later lost the general election to Republican candidate Ronald Reagan.|$|E
5|$|The National Safety Council, {{a nonprofit}} safety {{advocacy}} group, estimates U.S. motor vehicle deaths in 2016 were 40,200, a 14 {{percent increase from}} its 2014 estimate. The National Safety Council measures roadside deaths differently than U.S. government agencies. The National Safety Council counts traffic and non-traffic deaths within one year <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> while the government counts only traffic deaths occurring within 30 days of a crash. The National Safety Council's statistics show {{that the increase in}} 2016 was due only in part to increased miles driven (due to population growth, low gasoline prices, and a strengthening economy.) The National Safety Council suggests the increase in deaths not explained by increased vehicle miles is attributable to complacency about impaired driving and increased driver distraction.|$|E

5|$|Viktor Pugachyov, {{piloting}} {{the second}} Su-27K, {{became the first}} Russian to conventionally land aboard an aircraft carrier on 1 November 1989. It {{was found that the}} carrier's jet blast deflectors were too close to the engine nozzles when raised at an angle of 60°; thus an improvised solution held the deflectors at 45°. However, when the aircraft was in front of it for longer than the maximum six seconds, the shield's water pipes exploded. The pilot, Pugachyov, reduced engine throttle, accidentally causing the detents (blocks used to restrain aircraft from accelerating) to retract and the fighter to move forwards. The aircraft was quickly stopped; Pugachyov later took off without the use of blast deflectors or detents. Since then, a Kamov Ka-27PS search-and-rescue helicopter was flown close to the carrier in case <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{the primary}} focus is on driver safety near {{railroad}} crossings, other basic driving safety rules are reinforced, such as not passing on hills or curves, not driving or pulling over when fatigued or sleepy and not being a distracted driver. Alan is also shown a police report <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> where an acquaintance of his had died in an accident due to his reckless driving. Filling out the film is a nostalgic {{look back at the}} early 1900s, when such things as horseless carriages were parts of everyday life and four-lane superhighways—in the late 1950s still a relatively new concept—weren't even thought of, and slower and less congested roadways meant fewer dangers in driving; however, Hal cautions that his point is that the human body hasn't changed and that even more attention to safety must be heeded.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Taylor {{started having}} {{troubles}} {{in his personal}} life again. On November 8, {{he was arrested in}} Miami-Dade County, Florida for leaving the scene <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> after striking another vehicle with his Cadillac Escalade. He had already committed the same offense in 1996 when he totaled his Lexus in a one-car accident and left the scene, saying he did not think the law required the reporting of a single driver incident. He was released on a $500 bond, and the other driver later sued him, seeking $15,000. He was arrested six months later for having sex with a 16-year-old girl at a Holiday Inn located in Montebello, New York. He was charged with felony third-degree statutory rape, for allegedly engaging in sexual intercourse with someone under 17. He was also charged with third-degree patronization for allegedly paying the underage girl $300 to have sex with him. The girl was represented by celebrity attorney Gloria Allred when Taylor pleaded guilty on March 22, 2011 and was sentenced to six years probation as part of a plea agreement, in which he pleaded guilty to the misdemeanors of sexual misconduct and patronizing a prostitute. He will also have to register as a low-risk level one sex offender. On October 26, 2012, a court rejected the victim's claims that Taylor assaulted her.|$|E

By the 48th lap, Gordon had moved up 15 positions {{since the beginning of}} the race. On the 50th lap, the third caution was given after Bayne collided with the wall, sustaining major damage. Most drivers made pit stops during the caution. At the lap 55 restart, Kurt Busch was the leader, while Edwards fell to 15th. On lap 56, Matt Kenseth up moved to second, as Tony Stewart up moved to the third position. On {{the following}} lap, Marcos Ambrose moved up to the fifth position. On the 67th lap, the caution was given because <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> involving 13 drivers. Afterward, the red flag was waved to help the officials to continue removing debris. At the lap 72 restart, Hamlin was the leader, ahead of Newman, and Menard. Dale Earnhardt, Jr. had to restart last, after getting a penalty for excessive speed on pit row. Three laps later, Newman overtook the lead after passing Hamlin, as Gordon moved up to second. On the 77th lap, Gordon passed Newman to become the leader, as his team-mate Johnson passed Kyle Busch to move the 11th position. On the following lap, Hamlin fell to third.

5|$|Solomon was born, {{probably}} circa 480/490, in {{the fortress}} of Idriphthon {{in the district}} of Solachon, near Dara in the province of Mesopotamia. He was a eunuch as a result <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> during his infancy, not from deliberate castration. Solomon had a brother, Bacchus, who became a priest. Bacchus fathered three sons, Cyrus, Sergius and Solomon, who later became military officers in Africa under their uncle; Sergius also succeeded Solomon as governor of Africa after the latter's death. Little is known of Solomon's early career, except that he served under the dux Mesopotamiae Felicissimus, perhaps as early as the latter's installment to the post in 505/506. Certainly by 527, {{when he came to the}} service of General Belisarius, Solomon was considered an experienced officer. It is perhaps at this time that he was named Belisarius's domesticus, or chief-of-staff, the post with which he is mentioned by the historian Procopius in 533, before the onset of the campaign against the Vandal Kingdom of North Africa.|$|E
5|$|The first {{qualifying}} session began {{under the}} threat of rain, {{so most of the}} teams tried to set a good lap time before the conditions deteriorated.

The No. 33 Barazi-Epsilon Zytek led LMP2, after an earlier misfiring problem had been repaired. Oreca's Saleens were the fastest two GT1 cars, while Ferrari and Porsche were close to one another in GT2. The session was red flagged about halfway through because <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> in which the No. 53 JLOC Lamborghini Murciélago, driven by Marco Apicella, hit the wall at the first Mulsanne chicane. The No. 25 Ray Mallock Ltd. Lola and No. 81 LNT Panoz were the only cars not to set a lap time before the session briefly returned to green as rain began.
