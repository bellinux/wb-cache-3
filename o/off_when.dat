5|$|In June 1915, {{passengers}} on Batavier II witnessed {{an attack by}} two German airplanes against a British steamship between the Galloper and the North Hinder Lightships.

5|$|A {{small wooden}} {{platform}} was built at Hellingly railway station, opposite {{the main line}} platform. This had no connection to the station buildings and was used only for the transfer of passengers between main-line and hospital trains, and kept chained <b>off</b> <b>when</b> not in use. Coal yards and sidings were also built at Hellingly station. The hospital opened to patients, and the railway to passengers, on 20 July 1903.|$|E

A repeat the next day resulted in a classic dogfight with F-100 Super Sabres and F-105s fighting with more MiG-17s. In total, the USAF lost eleven aircraft to air and ground forces, while the VPAF lost three of their fighters.|$|E

5|$|Many adult dragonflies have {{brilliant}} iridescent or metallic colours {{produced by}} structural coloration, making them conspicuous in flight. Their overall coloration {{is often a}} combination of yellow, red, brown, and black pigments, with structural colours. Blues are typically created by microstructures in the cuticle that reflect blue light. Greens often combine a structural blue with a yellow pigment. Freshly emerged adults, known as tenerals, are often pale-coloured and obtain their typical colours after a few days, some have their bodies covered with a pale blue, waxy powderiness called pruinosity; it wears <b>off</b> <b>when</b> scraped during mating, leaving darker areas.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{scholars}} {{debate whether}} the Ming dynasty had sovereignty over Tibet. Some {{believe it was}} a relationship of loose suzerainty that was largely cut <b>off</b> <b>when</b> the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–67) persecuted Buddhism in favor of Daoism at court. Others argue that the significant religious nature of the relationship with Tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship. Others note the Ming need for Central Asian horses and the need to maintain the tea-horse trade.|$|E

5|$|The NGS deemed {{this gun}} {{obsolete}} {{shortly after the}} first ships were laid down, but the gun that it wanted to use, the Canon de 138 mm modèle 1923, was not yet available, so they planned to replace the 130mm guns later. The guns and their larger hoists were ordered well before any of the ships were completed {{and had to be}} written <b>off</b> <b>when</b> it became apparent that the ships' stability was too marginal to tolerate the additional top weight.|$|E

He was assigned to officiate his first playoff game in 1986.|$|E
5|$|After the {{standoff}} entered its fourth hour, Valencia {{succeeded in getting}} Saldívar to confess that she had intended to shoot herself. Saldívar said when she placed the gun to her own head, Selena {{tried to tell her}} not to kill herself. When Selena opened the door to leave, Saldívar said she told her to close it. She also said the gun went <b>off</b> <b>when</b> Selena left. During the sixth hour, Saldívar agreed to give herself up, but when she saw a police officer pointing a rifle at her, she panicked, ran back to her truck, picked up the revolver, and pointed it at her head again. Saldívar surrendered after more than nine hours. By then, hundreds of Selena's fans had gathered at the scene; many wept as police took Saldívar away. A press conference was called within hours of Selena's murder; Saldívar had not yet been named in media reports. Assistant Police Chief Ken Bung and Quintanilla, Jr. told the press the possible motive was Selena's intention to terminate Saldívar's employment.|$|E
