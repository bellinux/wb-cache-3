The tank had been captured and used by retreating German troops, who dumped it in the swamp when it ran out of fuel. The anaerobic environment of the bog preserved the tank and ensured there were no signs of <b>oil</b> <b>leakage,</b> rust, or other significant water damage.

25|$|Qantas Flight 32: an Airbus A380 {{flying from}} London Heathrow to Sydney (via Singapore) in 2010 had an {{uncontained}} failure in a Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine. The failure {{was found to}} have been caused by a misaligned counter bore within a stub oil pipe leading to a fatigue fracture. This in turn led to an <b>oil</b> <b>leakage</b> followed by an oil fire in the engine. The fire led to the release of the Intermediate Pressure Turbine (IPT) disc. The airplane, however, landed safely. This led to the grounding of the entire Qantas A380 fleet.|$|E

2500|$|The {{investigation}} by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) indicated that [...] "fatigue cracking" [...] in a stub pipe within the engine resulted in <b>oil</b> <b>leakage</b> followed by an oil fire in the engine. The fire led {{to the release of}} the Intermediate Pressure Turbine (IPT) disc. It also said the issue is specific to the Trent 900.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 December 2010, the ATSB {{issued a}} {{preliminary}} report which contained a key finding of a manufacturing flaw: An area of fatigue cracking was found within a stub pipe that feeds oil to the engine HP/IP bearing structure. Bearing lubricating oil leaked from the crack, causing the subsequent engine fire and failure of the IPT disc. The fatigue fracture {{was a result of}} the misalignment of the stub pipe during the counter-boring process. That inaccurate alignment resulted in one side of the same stub pipe becoming too thin to resist fatigue fracturing. This [...] "could lead to an elevated risk of fatigue crack initiation and growth, <b>oil</b> <b>leakage</b> and potential catastrophic engine failure from a resulting oil fire," [...] according to the agency.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} feasibility {{and convenience}} of transition from conventional oleodynamic power drives onboard liner/military ships to all-electric drives (AEDs). Classical hydrostatic transmission drives (HTDs) are cumbersome, heavy, complex, low efficiency systems and need intensive maintenance for <b>oil</b> <b>leakages</b> and filters, but feature high torque/thrust density and reliability. Alternative AEDs feature compactness, high efficiency, modularity, and better electronic control by inverter, but advantages and limits must be evaluated. High torque/redundancy requirements need special designs. Two plant types are analyzed: mooring/anchor capstans and rudder steering gears. Commercial AEDs are considered, besides a new permanent-magnet linear motor under development suitable for rudder/fin direct drive application. HTDs and AEDs are compared {{on the basis}} of encumbrance, weight, efficiency, redundancy, maintenance, complexity, modularity, reliability. Advantages of using AEDs are outlined...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a novel fault {{tolerant}} control is proposed to accommodate damper faults (<b>oil</b> <b>leakages)</b> in a semi-active suspension {{system based on}} a quarter-car vehicle model. The fault accommodation {{is based on the}} Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) control strategy and involved in 2 steps. At first, a fast time-varying fault is estimated by using the fast adaptive fault estimation (FAFE) algorithm and based on an unknown input adaptive observer. Thanks to information about the estimated fault, the dissipativity domain of the semi-active suspension is adapted according to the fault. Then a single LPV {{fault tolerant}} controller is developed to manage the system performances. The controller solution, derived in the LPV/H ∞ framework, is based on the LMI solution for polytopic systems. Some simulation results are presented that show the effectiveness of this approach...|$|R
40|$|Permeable {{pavements}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} commonly-used sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) in urban areas for managing stormwater runoff problems. Porous asphalt is widely used in surface layers of permeable pavement systems, where it can suffer from accidental oil spills from vehicles. Oil spills affect bituminous mixes through the solvent action of the hydrocarbons on the bitumen, reducing the raveling resistance of asphalt pavements. In order to assess the raveling resistance in porous asphalt pavements, the Cantabro abrasion test was performed on 200 test samples after applying controlled oil spills. Three different types of binders were used: conventional bitumen, polymer-modified bitumen and special fuel-resistant bitumen. After analyzing the results, it was concluded that the most suitable bitumen to protect against <b>oil</b> <b>leakages</b> is the polymer-modified one, which is far better than the other two types of bitumen tested...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAbstract [...] A novel fault {{tolerant}} strategy to compensate multiplicative actuator faults (damper <b>oil</b> <b>leakages)</b> in a semiactive suspension system is proposed. The compensation {{of the lack}} of damping force caused by a faulty damper is carried on by the remainder three healthy semi-active dampers. Once a faulty damper is detected and isolated by a Fault Detection and Isolation strategy based on parity-space, an estimator is activated to compute the missing damping force to compensate. In order to fulfill the semi-active damper constraints, the fault accommodation is based on the Linear-Parameter Varying (LPV) control strategy. Thus, each corner has a fault estimator and an LPV controller oriented to comfort and road holding. Simulation results show that the proposed {{fault tolerant}} semiactive suspension improves the vehicle comfort up to 60 % with respect to a controlled suspension without fault-tolerant strategy and 82 % with respect to a passive suspension...|$|R

40|$|Crude <b>oil</b> <b>leakages</b> often {{give rise}} to in situ {{contamination}} with both oil and salt. In this study, the biodegradation of model alkanes and of saturated hydrocarbons in whole crude oil by hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria was investigated at different salt (NaCl, KCl, Na 2 SO 4) concentrations. Changes in cell surface hydrophobicity at different NaCl concentrations were also investigated. The results show that with increasing NaCl concentration, the lag phase for strain growth on hydrocarbons was prolonged; however, the total degradation efficiency was not influenced greatly. The formation of different sizes of cell aggregates at different salt concentrations indicated that salt could indirectly influence mass transfer of hydrocarbons from the medium to {{the interior of the}} cells. The results also showed that KCl had a less inhibitory effect on biodegradation than NaCl, and changes of Na 2 SO 4 concentration did not greatly affect biodegradation.

50|$|The Caspian Sea, {{including}} Baku Bay, {{has been}} polluted by <b>oil</b> <b>leakages</b> and the dumping of raw or inadequately treated sewage, reducing the yield of caviar and fish.

The continued regular use of the pesticide DDT in the 1970s and 1980s was an egregious lapse, although that chemical was officially banned in the Soviet Union because of its toxicity to humans. Excessive application of pesticides and chemical fertilizers has caused extensive groundwater pollution and has been linked by Azerbaijani scientists to birth defects and illnesses. Rising water levels in the Caspian Sea, mainly caused by natural factors exacerbated by man-made structures, have reversed the decades-long drying trend and now threaten coastal areas; the average level rose 1.5 meters between 1978 and 1993.

5000|$|Several {{wind turbine}} design and {{manufacturing}} companies experiment with alternative yaw breaking methods {{in order to}} eliminate the drawbacks of the existing systems and {{to reduce the cost}} of the system. One of these alternatives involves the use of air pressure in order to achieve the necessary yaw braking moment. In this case, some of the gliding surface (usually the axial, due to higher available surface) is utilized in order to accommodate the yaw brake pads and the pneumatic brake mechanism. The pneumatic actuator can be a conventional pneumatic cylinder or even a flexible air chamber which inflates when supplied with pressurized air. Such a device is able to exert very high braking forces due to the high active surface. This is achieved with a simple industrial air pressure compression system (...) which is a reliable and low cost solution. Furthermore, in the even of leakage, the environmental impact is practically zero compared to hydraulic <b>oil</b> <b>leakages.</b> Finally brake actuators can be produced with very low cost from lightweight plastic materials thus significantly reducing the overall cost of the system.|$|R
