5|$|Scholars have {{suggested}} that <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> in general and poetry in particular was well placed to {{play a part in}} cultural resistance to apartheid. Music and poetry were more accessible to a large number of South Africans than written material (partly due to the restrictions placed by apartheid). Music, poetry, and storytelling also formed part of the everyday life of a number of South Africans, and protest songs emerged from these traditions. In addition, poetry was traditionally seen by some South Africans as a legitimate means of criticising authority, with poetic licence allowing artists to say things that would otherwise not be acceptable.|$|E

The missionaries {{introduced}} him to European literature, including the works of Dutch writers such as Anna Louisa Geertruida Bosboom-Toussaint and Jacob van Lennep, as well as works by French authors like Jules Verne, Alexandre Dumas, and Pierre Alexis Ponson du Terrail. In his doctoral thesis, J. Francisco B.

This paper therefore examined <b>oral</b> <b>tradition</b> as {{a reliable}} source of historical writing: arguments {{for and against}} and implications for historical writing in education. To do this, {{efforts were made to}} define the concept of <b>oral</b> <b>tradition,</b> arguments for the use of <b>oral</b> <b>tradition</b> as a reliable source of historical writing, arguments against and implications for historical writing in education. It was therefore concluded that <b>oral</b> <b>tradition</b> can be used in historical writing in education.

More often, however, slow lorises are used in traditional medicine or to ward off evil.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on {{the third}} day, ukukus grouped by {{moieties}} climb the glaciers on Qullqipunku to retrieve crosses set on top. Some ukukus traditionally spent the night on the glacier to combat spirits. They also cut and bring back blocks of the ice, which {{is believed to have}} sacred medicinal qualities. The ukukus are considered to be the only ones capable of dealing with condenados, the cursed souls said to inhabit the snowfields. According to <b>oral</b> <b>traditions,</b> ukukus from different moieties used to engage in ritual battles on the glaciers, but this practice was banned by the Catholic Church. After a mass celebrated later this day, most pilgrims leave the sanctuary. One group carries the Lord of Quyllurit'i in procession to Tayankani before taking it back to Mawallani.|$|E
5|$|By {{relying on}} the written works of both Christian and Muslim authors, <b>oral</b> <b>traditions,</b> and modern methods of anthropology, archaeology, and linguistics, Mohammed Hassen, Associate Professor of History at Georgia State University, asserts that the largely non-Christian Oromo people have interacted and lived among the Semitic-speaking Christian Amhara people {{since at least the}} 14th century, not the 16th century as is {{commonly}} accepted in both traditional and recent Ethiopian historiography.

40|$|The {{contention}} in {{this article}} is that African <b>oral</b> <b>tradition</b> should be reexamined in view of its perceived new importance in the work of African novelists. This article investigates the nature and definition of <b>oral</b> <b>tradition,</b> as well as the use of <b>oral</b> <b>tradition</b> as a cultural tool. The increasing inclusion of oral literature as part of the African literature component within university and school curricula is discussed. Finally, the pronounced role of <b>oral</b> <b>tradition</b> in fiction is examined, using as exemplars some seminal works of Bessie Head (1978, 1990 and 1995) and Ngugi wa Thiong’o (1965, 1977, 1981, and 1982) ...|$|R

5|$|Early modern Europe saw the {{emergence}} {{for the first}} time of a distinctive elite culture: while the Reformation encouraged new skepticism and opposition to traditional beliefs, subsequent Romanticism encouraged the fetishisation of such beliefs by intellectual elites. The effects of this on writing about elves are most apparent in England and Germany, with developments in each country influencing the other. In Scandinavia, the Romantic movement was also prominent, and literary writing was the main context for continued use of the word elf, except in fossilised words for illnesses. However, <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> about beings like elves remained prominent in Scandinavia into the early twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|In 1903–04 Vaughan Williams started {{collecting}} folk-songs. He {{had always}} been interested in them, and now followed the example of a recent generation of enthusiasts such as Cecil Sharp and Lucy Broadwood in going into the English countryside noting down and transcribing songs traditionally sung in various locations. Collections of the songs were published, preserving many that could otherwise have vanished as <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> died out. Vaughan Williams incorporated some into his own compositions, and more generally was influenced by their prevailing modal forms. This, together with his love of Tudor and Stuart music, helped shape his compositional style {{for the rest of his}} career.|$|E

And finally, academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure.

40|$|Coming {{from the}} field of {{folklore}} studies, I understand by <b>oral</b> <b>tradition</b> the <b>oral</b> transmission and communication of knowledge, conceptions, beliefs, and ideas, and especially the formalization and formulation of these into reports, practices, and representations that foreground elements that favor their replication.

5|$|Indigenous peoples {{living in}} northeastern North America {{were the first}} groups known to have {{produced}} maple syrup and maple sugar. According to aboriginal <b>oral</b> <b>traditions,</b> as well as archaeological evidence, maple tree sap was being processed into syrup long before Europeans arrived in the region. There are no authenticated accounts of how maple syrup production and consumption began, but various legends exist; {{one of the most}} popular involves maple sap being used in place of water to cook venison served to a chief. Other stories credit the development of maple syrup production to Nanabozho, Glooskap, or the squirrel. Aboriginal tribes developed rituals around sugar-making, celebrating the Sugar Moon (the first full moon of spring) with a Maple Dance. Many aboriginal dishes replaced the salt traditional in European cuisine with maple sugar or syrup.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda {{does not}} {{have a long history of}} written literature, but there is a strong oral {{tradition}} ranging from poetry to folk stories. Many of the country's moral values and details of history have been passed down through the generations. The most famous Rwandan literary figure was Alexis Kagame (1912–1981), who carried out and published research into <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> as well as writing his own poetry. The Rwandan Genocide resulted in the emergence of a literature of witness accounts, essays and fiction by a new generation of writers such as Benjamin Sehene. A number of films have been produced about the Rwandan Genocide, including the Golden Globe-nominated Hotel Rwanda, Shake Hands with the Devil, Sometimes in April, and Shooting Dogs, the last two having been filmed in Rwanda and having featured survivors as cast members.|$|E
5|$|Several other <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> {{about the}} castle survive. One of these {{involves}} a child prisoner within the castle, who escaped, throwing {{the key to}} her dungeon into a nearby field, sometimes argued to be an outcrop of land north-west of the castle, which from then onwards was infertile. Another centres on a man called Gallon who was left {{in charge of the}} castle by Margaret of Anjou and entrusted with a set of valuables; captured by the Yorkists, he escaped and later returned to reclaim six Venetian glasses. The historian Katrina Porteous has noted that in the 14th century there are records of receivers and bailiffs at the castle called Galoun, potentially linked to the origins of the Gallon of this story.|$|E

Owing largely to the conflict between Zahir and the Druze emirs of Mount Lebanon, he Druze of Galilee did not fare well under Zahir and his Zaydani clan. In the <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> of Galilee's Druze inhabitants, Zahir's reign was synonymous with oppression.

5|$|Although no fossil {{evidence}} has been dated within the last 1,000 years, the hippopotamus has been surprisingly common in the oral legends of the Malagasy. In 1648, Étienne de Flacourt became the French governor of Madagascar and {{he wrote in his}} Histoire de la grande isle de Madagascar about hearing stories from the Malagasy about an animal called the mangarsahoc which closely resembled the hippopotamus. In different regions of Madagascar, stories were recorded of the tsy-aomby-aomby, the omby-rano, and the laloumena, all animals that resembled hippopotami, but few other animals on the island. In 1902, a colonial administrator named Raybaud asserted that stories he heard in the highlands could only be about Malagasy hippos still living as late as 1878. The strength of these <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> led the IUCN to classify the Malagasy hippopotami as recent extinctions.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} half of the period is largely prehistoric, {{archaeology}} plays an important part in studies of early Medieval Scotland. There are no significant contemporary internal sources for the Picts, although evidence has been gleaned from lists of kings, annals preserved in Wales and Ireland and from sources written down much later, which may draw on <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> or earlier sources. From the 7th century there is documentary evidence from Latin sources including the lives of saints, such as Adomnán's Life of St. Columba, and Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People. Archaeological sources include settlements, art, and surviving everyday objects. Other aids to understanding in this period include onomastics (the study of names) – divided into toponymy (place-names), showing the movement of languages, and the sequence in which different languages were spoken in an area, and anthroponymy (personal names), which can offer clues to relationships and origins.|$|E

5|$|Bicycle kicks first {{occurred}} in the Pacific ports of Chile and Peru. While their ships were docked, British mariners played football among themselves and with locals {{as a form of}} leisure; the sport's practice was embraced at the ports because its simple rules and equipment made it accessible to the general public. Peru's chief seaport of Callao, where football became a working-class sport, is possibly where the bicycle kick originates as news reports and <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> indicate that the local Afro-Peruvians performed the bicycle kick or tiro de chalaca ("chalaca shot", as spectators called it in reference to the local demonym) in the late 19th century, during matches with British sailors and railroad employees. Chile's important seaport of Talcahuano also holds a bicycle kick tradition dating to the 1910s, when Ramón Unzaga, a Basque athlete born in Spain and a naturalized Chilean, allegedly invented the manoeuvre locally known as chorera (also alluding the local demonym).|$|E
5|$|Rudimentary botanical science {{began with}} empirically-based plant lore passed from {{generation}} to generation in the <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> of paleolithic hunter-gatherers. The first written records of plants were made in the Neolithic Revolution about 10,000 years ago as writing was developed in the settled agricultural communities where plants and animals were first domesticated. The first writings that show human curiosity about plants themselves, rather than the uses that could be made of them, appears in the teachings of Aristotle's student Theophrastus at the Lyceum in ancient Athens in about 350 BC; this is considered the starting point for modern botany. In Europe, this early botanical science was soon overshadowed by a medieval preoccupation with the medicinal properties of plants that lasted more than 1000 years. During this time, the medicinal works of classical antiquity were reproduced in manuscripts and books called herbals. In China and the Arab world, the Greco-Roman work on medicinal plants was preserved and extended.|$|E
5|$|Scientists have {{estimated}} {{that there have been}} at least 13significant earthquakes along the Cascadia subduction zone in the last 6,000years. The most recent, the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, was recorded in the <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> of the First Nations people on Vancouver Island. It caused considerable tremors and a massive tsunami that traveled across the Pacific Ocean. The significant shaking associated with this earthquake demolished houses of the Cowichan Tribes on Vancouver Island and caused several landslides. Shaking due to this earthquake made it too difficult for the Cowichan people to stand, and the tremors were so lengthy that they were sickened. The tsunami created by the earthquake ultimately devastated a winter village at Pachena Bay, killing all the people that lived there. The 1700 Cascadia earthquake caused near-shore subsidence, submerging marshes and forests on the coast that were later buried under more recent debris.|$|E
