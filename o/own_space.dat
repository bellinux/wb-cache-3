5|$|Póvoa's {{theatrical}} tradition can {{be traced}} to 1793 when Italian operas and Portuguese comedies were presented in a theatre built in Campo das Cobras. It developed with Teatro Garrett (1873) and Teatro Sá da Bandeira (1876). The Varazim Teatro is a cultural and youth group of amateur theatre that has encouraged local drama with its <b>own</b> <b>space</b> known as Espaço D'Mente. Póvoa de Varzim Auditorium houses the local school of music and the Póvoa de Varzim Symphony Orchestra, which is the resident orchestra during the Festival Internacional de Música da Póvoa de Varzim, an event established in 1978. Póvoa de Varzim Music Hall is the residence of Banda Musical da Póvoa de Varzim (1864) and its pops orchestra.|$|E
5|$|With closer {{proximity}} to schools, more parking, and double {{the availability of}} shelf space, the village purchased the former station for $12,500 ($ today) and leased the building and its acre of land to the library. The library required $20,500 ($ today) for purchasing and renovating the building; it raised $14,000 ($ today) from village residents, with the remainder funded by the village board. On April 19, 1959, the refurbished building was dedicated and the village board named the street {{that led to the}} library Library Road. With its <b>own</b> <b>space,</b> the library increased its collection, hired more staff, and doubled its operating hours. Also in 1959, the library received its absolute charter, and transferred the charter in 1964 from a free library association to a fully tax-supported public library and thus changed its name from the Briarcliff Free Library to the Briarcliff Manor Public Library.|$|E
40|$|Privately <b>owned</b> public <b>spaces</b> are {{frequently}} criticized for diminishing the publicness of public space by restricting social interaction, constraining individual liberties, and excluding undesirable populations. This study empirically determines whether, as is commonly believed, privately <b>owned</b> public <b>spaces</b> are more controlled than publicly <b>owned</b> <b>spaces.</b> To frame our empirical work, we propose a conceptual model that identifies publicness as {{the interaction between}} the ownership, management, and uses/users of a space. We then examine the management dimension using an observation-based index to assess spatial management paradigms in publicly and privately <b>owned</b> <b>spaces.</b> We find that the use of the private sector to provide publicly accessible space leads to increased control over use, behavior, and access. Furthermore, while both publicly and privately <b>owned</b> public <b>spaces</b> tend equally to encourage public use and access, managers of privately <b>owned</b> <b>spaces</b> tend to employ more features that control behavior within those spaces. More specifically, spatial control in privately <b>owned</b> <b>spaces</b> is normally achieved through the use of surveillance and policing techniques as well as design measures that ‘code’ spaces as private. Important findings are presented for planners, policy makers, and others concerned with the future of publicly accessible spaces. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{country has}} {{developed}} into a centre of Islamic banking, and is {{the country with the}} highest numbers of female workers in that industry. Knowledge-based services are also expanding. To create a self-reliant defensive ability and support national development, Malaysia privatised some of its military facilities in the 1970s. The privatisation has created defence industry, which in 1999 was brought under the Malaysia Defence Industry Council. The government continues to promote this sector and its competitiveness, actively marketing the defence industry. Science policies in Malaysia are regulated by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation. The country is one of the world's largest exporters of semiconductor devices, electrical devices, and IT and communication products. Malaysia began developing its <b>own</b> <b>space</b> programme in 2002, and in 2006, Russia agreed to transport one Malaysian to the International Space Station as part of a multibillion-dollar purchase of 18 Russian Sukhoi Su-30MKM fighter jets by the Royal Malaysian Air Force.

The space agency has expressed a desire to put Indonesian satellites in orbit with native launch vehicles by 2040.|$|E

25|$|Riot grrrl {{culture is}} often {{associated}} with third wave feminism, which also grew rapidly during the same early nineties timeframe. The movement of third-wave feminism focused less on laws and the political process and more on individual identity. The movement of third-wave feminism is said to have arisen out of the realization that women are of many colors, ethnicities, nationalities, religions and cultural backgrounds. The riot grrrl movement allowed women their <b>own</b> <b>space</b> to create music and make political statements about the issues they were facing in the punk rock community and in society.

50|$|Privately <b>owned</b> public <b>space</b> (POPS), or alternatively, privately <b>owned</b> public open <b>spaces</b> (POPOS), are terms used to {{describe}} a type of public space that, although privately owned, is legally required {{to be open to}} the public under a city's zoning ordinance or other land-use law. The acronym POPOS is preferentially used over POPS on the west coast of the US. Both terms can be used to represent either a singular or plural space or spaces. These spaces are usually the product of a deal between cities and private real estate developers in which cities grant valuable zoning concessions and developers provide in return privately <b>owned</b> public <b>spaces</b> in or near their buildings. Privately <b>owned</b> public <b>spaces</b> commonly include plazas, arcades, small parks, and atriums. Many cities worldwide, including Auckland, New York City, San Francisco, Seattle, Seoul, and Toronto, have privately <b>owned</b> public <b>spaces.</b> Some cities and advocacy groups have created websites about these spaces (see, for example, apops.mas.org).|$|R
