5|$|In June 2011, Pre-Trial Chamber II {{requested}} that the Prosecutor, defendants, and victims comment on the possibility <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> the confirmation of charges hearings in Kenya rather than in The Hague. This move was supported by Amnesty International, which claimed that holding the hearings in Kenya would bring the justice process closer to victims. The idea <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> the hearings in Kenya was also supported by the defendants Francis Muthaura and Henry Kosgey, with Mathaura suggesting holding the hearings in a military barracks for enhanced security as well as suggesting the possibility <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> the hearings in Arusha, Tanzania, which is {{the location of the}} International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The move was opposed by the Prosecution, who cited security concerns as an obstacle, and also by Ali, Kenyatta, Ruto, and Sang who cited the possibility that a change of venue would lead to delays in the trial process in submissions made to the Court. On 29 June Judge Trendafilova ruled that the hearings will take place at the seat of the Court in The Hague.|$|E

5|$|Edinburgh was {{formally}} {{established as a}} royal burgh by King David I of Scotland around 1125. This gave the town the privilege <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> a market, {{and the ability to}} raise money by taxing goods coming into the burgh for sale. It is probable, therefore, that some form of boundary was constructed around this time, although {{it may have been a}} timber palisade or ditch, rather than a stone wall.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} a {{quantitative}} analysis <b>of</b> weak hand <b>holds</b> based on corpus data. We include both a cross-linguistic analysis <b>of</b> these <b>holds</b> in narrative data from Russian Sign Language (RSL) and Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT), and a language-internal, cross-genre analysis comparing NGT narrative and conversational data. We classified the functions <b>of</b> all <b>holds</b> found in two corpora of RSL and NGT, and analyzed their formal characteristics. We found that holds in RSL and NGT have similar functions. However, holds are significantly more frequent in RSL than in NGT. In addition, {{we found that}} the distribution <b>of</b> <b>holds</b> across different functions varies between different genres in NGT. The similarities between RSL and NGT in the domain <b>of</b> <b>holds</b> may be attributed to modality effects. The differences in frequency <b>of</b> <b>holds</b> ask for a language-specific explanation, and we discuss several possible scenarios...|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} {{measures}} {{have not been}} confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers. There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> one's urine, tampon use, and douching. In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm {{as a method of}} contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods. In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.|$|E

5|$|After Houston {{received}} word that Santa Anna was leading a large force to San Antonio, Bowie offered to lead volunteers {{to defend the}} Alamo from the expected attack. He arrived with 30men on January 19, where they found a force of 104men with a few weapons and a few cannons, but not many supplies and little gunpowder. Houston {{knew that there were}} not enough men to hold the fort in an attack and had given Bowie authority to remove the artillery and blow up the fortification. Bowie and the Alamo commander, James C. Neill, decided they did not have enough oxen to move the artillery, and {{they did not want to}} destroy the fortress. On January 26, one of Bowie's men, James Bonham, organized a rally which passed a resolution in favor <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> the Alamo. Bonham signed the resolution first, with Bowie's signature second.|$|E

Other ECW related wrestlers were later added to the pay-per-view. The event was publicly confirmed by WWE through a Dish Network magazine in March 2005. In an interview with SLAM!
