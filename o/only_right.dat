5|$|According to an IAU draft resolution, the {{roundness}} condition generally {{results in}} {{the need for a}} mass of at least 5 kg, or diameter of at least 800km. However, Mike Brown claims that these numbers are <b>only</b> <b>right</b> for rocky bodies like asteroids, and that icy bodies like Kuiper Belt objects reach hydrostatic equilibrium at much smaller sizes, probably somewhere between 200 and 400km in diameter. It all depends on the rigidity of the material that makes up the body, which is in turn strongly influenced by its internal temperature. Assuming that Methone's shape reflects the balance between the tidal force exerted by Saturn and the moon's gravity, its tiny 3km diameter suggests Methone is composed of icy fluff.|$|E
5|$|Whoever {{looks in}} the past and thinks about the time of 1919 to 1932 will be {{overpowered}} by great pain {{in the face of the}} mistakes that have been made. When Hitler published his book Mein Kampf, it was time to begin the most stringent battle against the theories proposed in that book. Hitler proposed to do away with all present parties and institutions, even those brought about after centuries of sacrifices and great exertion. What would a man do if a thief announced a proposed break-in? Anybody would make security arrangements. And what did the government and the representatives of the people do? As much as nothing. A tired, weak and sick population, as well as a weak government, let a charlatan of the worst sort promise them healing. For every problem this quack had the <b>only</b> <b>right</b> medicine.

5|$|Cofresí {{received}} a council of war trial, with {{no possibility of}} a civil trial. The <b>only</b> <b>right</b> granted the pirates was to choose their lawyers; the arguments the attorneys could make were limited, and their role was a formality. José Madrazo was again the prosecutor. The case was hurried—an oddity, since other cases as serious (or more so) sometimes took months or years. Cofresí was reportedly tried as an insurgent corsair (and listed as such in a subsequent explanatory action in Spain), in accordance with measures enacted by governor Miguel de la Torre the year before. It is thought {{that the reason for}} the irregularities was that the Spanish government was under international scrutiny, with several neutral countries filing complaints about pirate and privateer attacks in Puerto Rican waters; there was additional pressure due to the start of David Porter's court-martial in the United States for invading the municipality of Fajardo. The ministry rushed the Cofresí trial, denying him and his crew defense witnesses or testimony (required by trial protocol). The trial was based on the pirates' confessions, with their legitimacy or circumstances not established.|$|E

25|$|People {{started to}} feel that the police were taking sides with the city council and Faderhuset. Tensions boiled over when a {{demonstration}} on 24 September was attacked by the police. The reason for the police attack apparently was a bottle being thrown at a police van. The police responded with a full frontal baton-charge on the demonstration. This led to several hours of street fighting between police and demonstrators. During the street fighting, three hundred people were arrested, many of which had not been involved with the fighting. A lot of these later claimed to have been brutally treated while in police custody. This sparked anger amongst the supporters of Ungdomshuset and many stated that violent resistance was now not only necessary and justified but the <b>only</b> <b>right</b> course of action that they could choose.|$|E
25|$|Although now obsolete, CRT {{computer}} displays {{suffered from}} reflection {{by the glass}} envelope, causing glare from room lights and consequently poor contrast. Several anti-reflection solutions were employed to ameliorate this problem. One solution utilized the principle of reflection of circularly polarized light. A circular polarizing filter {{in front of the}} screen allows for the transmission of (say) <b>only</b> <b>right</b> circularly polarized room light. Now, right circularly polarized light (depending on the convention used) has its electric (and magnetic) field direction rotating clockwise while propagating in the +z direction. Upon reflection, the field still has the same direction of rotation, but now propagation is in the −z direction making the reflected wave left circularly polarized. With the right circular polarization filter placed in front of the reflecting glass, the unwanted light reflected from the glass will thus be in very polarization state that is blocked by that filter, eliminating the reflection problem. The reversal of circular polarization on reflection and elimination of reflections in this manner can be easily observed by looking in a mirror while wearing 3-D movie glasses which employ left- and right-handed circular polarization in the two lenses. Closing one eye, the other eye will see a reflection in which it cannot see itself; that lens appears black. However the other lens (of the closed eye) will have the correct circular polarization allowing the closed eye to be easily seen by the open one.|$|E

25|$|The {{argument}} of centuries of social injustice through the caste system (see below, {{in the next}} Section) is not accepted by those who {{point out that the}} caste system, although differently known and practised in different societies, is a tribal hangover from the past, which had some merit in that it ensured, or 'reserved', specified jobs to be done castes which had a preference to do so. They have no sanction in the Vedas (the Upanishads Section) in which only speak of four broad 'Varnas' or divisions according to the temperament of people and of inter-Varna switch, or mobility, based on individual efforts when he/she happens to be borne to a man of a particular Varna. This process, called 'Samskara' is, approximately, conscious individual refinement. In a true sense, therefore, the talk of deliberate subjugation of or discrimination of upper castes against lower castes has no basis, even though distortions of the principle has happened historically, without sanction of the Vedas. Hence reservation, the anti-reservationists seem to say, is just a mask for demanding reservations under the cloak of casteism over-riding merit and blissfully ignoring that Vedas do not sanction this. At any rate, after several decades of Varna reservation for the lowest social strata comprising certain classes constitutionally enshrined as 'scheduled castes' and 'scheduled tribes', and otherwise open competition to all people irrespective of any criteria other than merit and aptitude, there is no justification for the political parties to demand extend reservation of educational admission and job opportunities to more classes ('other backward castes'). It is pointed out that more opportunities in keeping with the uncontrolled growth in population, in all spheres of economic activity as well as education, will be the <b>only</b> <b>right</b> answer and not reservation. However, since proportional representation is the basis of modern democracy as it is practised, these anti-reservationists point out, this, in India, has led to its most abominable abuse, resulting in a democracy which is of and by Indians but against their own interests, since a disunited country oblivious of equality of opportunity because of prohibitive reservation levels, can never compete successfully in the global context, nor achieve much in its own management of internal economy.(Already due to politicisation of trade unions, India's labour productivity remains among the lowest in the world, as a UK study had pointed out a few years ago.) The abuse of political power to demand reservation for all other than the so-called 'forward ' communities is, according to the contesters, just a vote bank politics to woo the majority represented by the beneficiary communities to cast their votes in their favour. Since, however, there are no opponents among political parties to educational and job reservations, in view of their universal vote bank politics, such reservation in themselves cannot favour any particular parties at the elections.|$|E

500|$|Although some architects {{designed}} the earlier Commissioners' churches in neoclassical style, most were in Gothic Revival style.

[...] Others were in a [...] "stilted Perpendicular" [...] style,. with [...] "thin west towers, thin buttresses, fat pinnacles, and interiors with three galleries and plaster vaults". [...] These features were only loosely derived from medieval Gothic architecture, and were not true representations of it. [...] A major influence on the subsequent development of the Gothic Revival was AWNPugin (1812–52) and, influenced by him, the Cambridge Camden Society (later named the Ecclesiological Society). [...] Among other things, they argued that not only should Gothic be the <b>only</b> <b>right</b> and proper style for churches, but that their features should be accurate representations of that style; they should be [...] "correct" [...] Gothic features, rather than being loosely derived from the style. [...] The term [...] "pre-archaeological" [...] was used to describe churches designed using features only loosely derived from true Gothic.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in mid–1960, but greatly {{accelerating}} in {{the summer}} of 1961, great numbers of Cuban anarchists migrated to the United States. That summer, in New York, the Movimiento Libertario Cubano en el Exilio (Cuban Libertarian Movement in Exile [...] ) was formed by some of these exiles, making contact with Spanish anarchists exiled following the Spanish Civil War, who were also living in New York. They also made contact with Sam Dolgoff and the New York-based Libertarian League. [...] "A Clarification and a Declaration of the Cuban Libertarians", a document by Gaona and signed by several other prominent anarchists, excoriated the libertarian press and advocated for the adoption of Castroism. In response to the widespread effect of the manifesto, the MLCE issued the Boletín de Información Libertaria with support from the Libertarian League, and the paper of the Federación Libertaria Argentina (FLA). Among many others, the FLA printed an essay by Abelardo Iglesias titled Revolución y Contrarevolución which stated the differences the Cuban anarchists saw between Marxist and anarchist revolution: [...] "To expropriate capitalist enterprises, handing them over to the workers and technicians, THIS IS REVOLUTION. But to convert them into state monopolies in which the <b>only</b> <b>right</b> of the producer is to obey, THIS IS COUNTER-REVOLUTION." ...|$|E
