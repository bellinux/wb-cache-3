Historically, seed treatment with <b>organomercury</b> <b>fungicides</b> reduced common bunt to manageable levels. Systemic seed treatment fungicides include carboxin, difenoconazole, triadimenol and others and are highly effective. However,in Australia and Greece, strains of T. laevis have developed resistance to polychlorobenzene fungicides.|$|E
40|$|The Wildlife and Pollution {{contract}} {{covers a}} long-term monitoring programme {{to examine the}} levels of pollutants in selected wildlife species in Britain. The programme was started when there were serious concerns over the effects of organochlorine insecticides and <b>organomercury</b> <b>fungicides</b> on several birds and mammals. This early work demonstrated {{the effects of the}} organochlorines, and eventually contributed to the ban on their use in this country and abroad. The programme has measured levels of these compounds in predatory and fish-eating birds since then. Investigations have also been made into the levels of industrial polychlorinated biphenys (PCBs), following their identification as pollutants in 1966. Mercury levels, derived from both agricultural and industrial sources, have also been tracked. In addition, the contract supports a wildlife incident investigation service, which can examine the causes of unexpected mortality incidents (that are not obviously related to oil pollution or to agricultural pesticides). In recent years, investigations have been made into the effects of the newest generation of rodenticides on barn owls. Gannet eggs are regularly collected biennially from two colonies and, when available, from other sites; eggs were collected from only one site in 1997. No major incidents were investigated in 1997. As this programme is now the longest running of its kind anywhere in the world, the findings stimulate considerable interest internationally, as well as in Britain. Annual reports give an interim summary of results. Every three years these annual results are gathered together into a more substantial report (like the present one) in which they are integrated with previous findings. In addition, results are published periodically in the scientific literature. Recent key papers are listed in this report under sub-project summaries. ...|$|E

In recent years, investigations have been made into the effects of the latest generation of rodenticides on barn owls Tyto alba. Northern gannet Morus bassanus eggs are also collected approximately biennially from two colonies and, when available, from other sites; eggs were collected from one site in 2000. This programme is now the longest-running of its kind anywhere {{in the world and the}} findings stimulate considerable interest internationally, as well as in Britain. Annual reports give an interim summary of results. This current report presents the results of analyses carried out on material collected in 2000. Every three years these annual results are gathered together into a more substantial report in which they are integrated with previous findings. The last report of this type covered the period up to and including 1997 (Newton et al. 1998) and is updated here. The present report summarises the long-term trends in all contaminants (except rodenticides, analysed in Shore et al. 2005) that occurred during the monitoring period up to and including the year 2000. Results are published periodically in the scientific literature, and recent key papers are listed in the references to the present report. The Wildlife and Pollution contract was the subject of scientific assessment within JNCC's rolling programme of peer review in autumn 1993 and was further assessed in 1996. As a result of the last two assessments, some monitoring was curtailed. Specifically, common kestrels Falco tinnunculus were no longer monitored for organochlorines, although from 2001 this species will be monitored annually for second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides. The Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) still collects specimens for studying other contaminants as part of its core research programme. Similarly, other species (peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus, common buzzard Buteo buteo, long-eared owl Asio otus, little owl Athene noctua, common kingfisher Alcedo atthis, great crested grebe Podiceps cristatus, and great bittern Botaurus stellaris) that were received in small numbers in occasional years were also not analysed routinely, although some were analysed in specific one-off studies and tissues from all birds received at CEH in 2000 are archived in deep-freeze for future potential analyses. Each section within the Wildlife and Pollution contract is summarised below. Each is dependent on the provision of material from amateur naturalists and other interested parties, and it is not always possible to obtain desired material for analysis, especially from remote areas. ...|$|E
40|$|Respiratory {{methods to}} {{estimate}} the amount of C in the soil microbial biomass and the relative contributions of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in the biomass were {{used to evaluate the}} influence of pesticides on the soil microflora. Experiments were conducted with 5 and 50 micrograms per gram of three fungicides, captan, thiram and verdesan. At 5 micrograms per gram they caused significant decreases (40 %) in the biomass; the <b>organomercury</b> <b>fungicide</b> verdesan also caused a shift from fungal to bacterial dominance. Within 8 days, biomass in captan- and thiram-amended soils had recovered to that of controls. Although the fungal to bacterial balance was restored in verdesan-amended soils, biomass recovery was not complete. At 50 micrograms per gram the fungicides caused long-term decreases in the biomass and altered the relative proportions of the bacterial and fungal populations. Verdesan had the greatest effect on soil microbial biomass and competition...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{pesticides}} to manage pest problems for crop protection is common practice around the world, and their accumulation in soils and contamination of water bodies is a global environmental problem. In Australia, an <b>organomercury</b> (Hg) -based <b>fungicide</b> {{is the most popular}} for control of pineapple disease of sugarcane. However, the presence of Hg is of great concern because of potential adverse effects in the environment. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the residual levels of Hg in soils of sugarcane cultivation from a catchment in North Queensland (Australia). Mercury was surveyed in soils close to the Tully River at 3 different depths (100, 200 and 300 mm). Additionally, total Hg (THg) and the labile fraction of Hg in water (measured by the diffusive gradient in thin film technique) were determined in the Tully River. A pristine site, the Tully Gorge National Park upstream of sugarcane fields, was selected for background Hg concentration estimation. In soils, Hg levels ranged from 18 to 264 μgkg- 1, with one of the soil samples being almost 10 times higher than at other sites at the surface level (199 μgkg- 1). Total and labile concentrations of Hg in water increased from the Hg-elevated soil sampling sites (0. 085 μgL- 1 and 0. 061 μgL- 1) to downstream sites (0. 082 μgL- 1 and 0. 066 μgL- 1), which is likely due to agricultural runoff. Indeed, except for the upstream control site, the THg concentration in water is over the limit permitted by the Australian freshwater quality guideline for protection of 99 % species (0. 06 μgL- 1). These findings point to the need to perform further research to reveal the mechanisms for release of Hg from soil and whether this might be causing important adverse effects to the Great Barrier Reef located in front of this river catchment...|$|R

The programme was started in the early 1960 s, when there were serious concerns over the effects of organochlorine insecticides and <b>organomercury</b> <b>fungicides</b> on various species of birds and mammals. This early work demonstrated {{the effects of the}} organochlorines and eventually contributed to the ban on their use in the UK and abroad. The programme has subsequently assessed the success of these bans by measuring whether there has been a decline in the concentrations of organochlorine pesticides in the livers and eggs of predatory and freshwater fish-eating birds. Investigations have also been made into the levels of industrial polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), following their identification as pollutants in 1966. Mercury levels, derived from both agricultural and industrial sources, have also been tracked, although mercury concentrations were not measured in birds collected in 2001.

This current report presents the results of analyses carried out on material collected in 2001. It also includes a review of long-term trends in second-generation anticoagulant rodenticide residues in barn owls that occurred during the monitoring period up to and including the year 2001. The Wildlife and Pollution contract was the subject of scientific assessment within JNCC's rolling programme of peer review in autumn 1993 and was further assessed in 1996. As a result of the last two assessments, some monitoring was curtailed. Most notably, common kestrels Falco tinnunculus are no longer monitored for organochlorines. However, from 2001 onwards, kestrels will be monitored for second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides following the results from an individual study, carried out as part of the PBMS activities, which demonstrated that this species may be particularly vulnerable to exposure to these compounds (Shore et al. 2001). Carcasses and eggs of predatory bird species (such as peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus, common buzzard Buteo buteo, long-eared owl Asio otus, little owl Athene noctua, common kingfisher Alcedo atthis, great crested grebe Podiceps cristatus, and great bittern Botaurus stellaris) which do not form the core part of the PBMS, but are sent to the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) by volunteers, are not analysed chemically. However, post-mortem examinations are carried out the carcasses, relevant information is recorded and the cause of death is determined (and reported back to the volunteer who submitted the carcass). Samples of the egg contents and body organs for these species, and samples for the species that do form part of the core monitoring, are all archived at - 20 °C as part of CEH's unique long-term tissue bank, and are often used in specific targeted research studies in subsequent years.
