5|$|Ale were {{believed}} {{to be able to make}} men insane; in eastern Serbia there is a special term for such a man: alosan.

Ale are also responsible for dogs’ rabies, although indirectly: a skylark that reaches the clouds and encounters an ala there goes mad (alosan), plunges to the ground, and so kills itself; a dog that finds and eats the bird goes mad too.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{attended}} Lafayette High School in Lexington, {{where he}} was a seventeen-time letterman in various sports. During one summer, his father expressed disappointment that he had decided to spend the summer selling vacuum cleaners instead of working <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>road</b> construction crew {{with the rest of his}} football teammates. Motivated by his father's disapproval, Brown averaged $1,000 in monthly commissions from vacuum cleaner sales. After high school, Brown matriculated to the University of Kentucky, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1957 and a law degree in 1960. While in law school, he made as much as $25,000 a year selling Encyclopædia Britannica sets, and employed a sales crew made up of classmates to increase his profits.|$|E
