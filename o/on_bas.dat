The growth rates of Nocardia spp. <b>on</b> <b>BA,</b> PA, PU, and PG were similar; but 3 -day-old colonies were larger <b>on</b> <b>BA</b> for 20 (45 %) isolates. After longer incubations (7 to 14 days), some Nocardia colonies were larger on PA, PG and PU than they were <b>on</b> <b>BA.</b> Despite variable morphologies <b>on</b> <b>BA,</b> colonies <b>on</b> PA, PG, and PU were consistently smooth, creamy, and raised.

The growth of Streptomyces spp. was greatly enhanced on GA, PG, UA, and PU and was poorest on PA.

40|$|AbstractAffect and {{motivation}} influence the error-related negativity (ERN) elicited by full errors; however, {{it is unknown}} whether they also influence ERNs to correct responses accompanied by covert incorrect response activation (partial errors). Here we compared a neutral condition with conditions, where correct responses were rewarded or where incorrect responses were punished with gains and losses of small amounts of money, respectively. Data analysis distinguished ERNs elicited by full and partial errors. In the reward and punishment conditions, ERN amplitudes to both full and partial errors were larger than in the neutral condition, confirming participants’ sensitivity to the significance of errors. We also investigated the relationships between ERN amplitudes and the behavioral inhibition and activation systems (BIS/BAS). Regardless of reward/punishment condition, participants scoring higher <b>on</b> <b>BAS</b> showed smaller ERN amplitudes in full error trials. These findings provide further evidence that the ERN is related to motivational valence and that similar relationships hold for both full and partial errors...|$|E
