5|$|In the United Kingdom, The Scout Association {{had been}} criticised for its {{insistence on the}} use of a {{religious}} promise, leading to the introduction of an alternative in January 2014 for those not wanting to mention a god in their promise. This change making the organisation entirely non-discriminatory on the grounds of race, gender, sexuality, and religion (<b>or</b> <b>lack</b> <b>thereof).</b>|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s, {{molecular}} biology was increasingly {{seen as a}} threat to the traditional core of evolutionary biology. Established evolutionary biologists—particularly Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, and George Gaylord Simpson, three of the architects of the modern synthesis—were extremely skeptical of molecular approaches, especially when it came to the connection (<b>or</b> <b>lack</b> <b>thereof)</b> to natural selection. The molecular-clock hypothesis and the neutral theory were particularly controversial, spawning the neutralist-selectionist debate over the relative importance of mutation, drift and selection, which continued into the 1980s without a clear resolution.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the severe agricultural damage, the government initiated a food ration. By {{two months after the}} storm, assistance pledges amounted to over $37 million (1979 US$) from various groups around the world. Similar to the aftermath of other natural disasters, the distribution of the aid raised concerns and accusations over the amount of food and material, <b>or</b> <b>lack</b> <b>thereof,</b> for the affected citizens. The Hurricane destroyed some important landmarks, including {{a significant part of the}} ruins of the Fort Young which had stood since the 1770s.|$|E

He was sentenced to forfeit $1,500 of salary a month for five months and received a written reprimand. The USAF did not reveal whether any other officer involved in the chain of events leading to the crash received any type of administrative or disciplinary action. Critics of USAF's safety record stated that this crash was an example of a pattern of problems related to enforcement of safety procedures within USAF.|$|E
5|$|The book {{begins by}} {{describing}} conditions aboard Iowa before the explosion. Thompson depicts Moosally, the ship's captain, as an inept seaman who gained {{command of the}} battleship through political connections. Under Moosally's leadership, <b>or</b> <b>lack</b> <b>thereof,</b> Iowa operated with severe training and safety deficiencies, {{especially with regard to}} operations with the ship's 16-inch guns. The book details how the ship's Master Chief Fire Controlman, Stephen Skelley, conducted illegal gunnery experiments with the 16-inch guns. Moosally apparently did not check to ensure that the experiments were authorized, or in some cases, appears not to have been aware that they were being carried out.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from a first-person {{perspective}} and allows the player to undertake a series of assassination missions {{in a variety of}} ways, with an emphasis on player choice. Missions can be completed through stealth, combat, or a combination of both. Exploring each level opens new paths and alternatives for accomplishing mission goals, and it is possible to complete all missions, eliminating all of Corvo's targets, in a non-lethal manner. The story and missions are changed in response to the player's violent actions <b>or</b> <b>lack</b> <b>thereof.</b> Magical abilities and equipment are designed to be combined to create new and varied effects.|$|E

5|$|Nearly {{every action}} (<b>or</b> <b>lack</b> <b>thereof)</b> affects how the player is judged by their followers: the player {{may be seen}} as a good god, an evil one, or {{in-between}} the two. The land, interface (including the hand), and music change according to that alignment. A good god's temple is brightly coloured, while an evil god's is designed to look intimidating. It is not necessary to consistently perform acts of either alignment and a mixture of the two can be used to stay neutral. The player has two advisors, one good and the other evil, who try to persuade the player to do things their according to their alignment.|$|E
5|$|Thomas C. Thayer, {{chief of}} the Advanced Research Projects Agency for four years during the war, {{believed}} that only about one-twentieth of the cargo imported into the north moved southward on the Ho Chi Minh Trail and that more than two-thirds eventually reached the battlefields in the south. More recently however, {{a new study by}} Air Force historian Eduard Mark has attempted to rehabilitate the Air Force's original claims by finding a rough correlation between trucks imported into North Vietnam during the war and those that were claimed by the American pilots as destroyed. Only the opening of the Vietnamese archives to scholarly research will reveal the true effectiveness (<b>or</b> <b>lack</b> <b>thereof)</b> of the American electronic and aerial effort.|$|E
5|$|While the dinosaur-bird {{connection}} (<b>or</b> <b>lack</b> <b>thereof)</b> {{was being}} pursued in paleontology, {{the problem of}} the evolution of flight was under scrutiny as well. It was observed that a number of animals with moderate flying or gliding ability, such as bats, flying lizards and flying squirrels have arboreal lifestyles. This led to the idea that the ancestors of birds must have gradually acquired the ability to fly from leaping among branches in the tops of trees. The Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa proposed an alternate hypothesis in 1907, arguing that the ancestors of birds were fast-running, bipedal animals related to theropod dinosaurs. When Heilmann came onto the paleontology scene, these two sets of conflicting theories provided the framework for his research and eventual conclusions.|$|E

50|$|Most macroeconomists {{replace the}} {{equation}} of exchange with equations for the demand for money which describe more regular and predictable economic behavior. However, predictability (<b>or</b> the <b>lack</b> <b>thereof)</b> of the velocity of money is equivalent to predictability (<b>or</b> the <b>lack</b> <b>thereof)</b> of the demand for money (since in equilibrium real money demand is simply Q/V). Either way, this unpredictability made policy-makers at the Federal Reserve rely less on the money supply in steering the U.S.economy. Instead, the policy focus has shifted to interest rates such as the fed funds rate.|$|R

5|$|White {{missed the}} opening of NBA camp on Monday October 1, due to a desire to have a {{contractual}} plan put in place with the Rockets and the NBA that addressed the league wide mental health policy <b>or</b> <b>lack</b> <b>thereof.</b> After sessions with his own long-time doctor, White requested permission to travel by bus when {{necessary in order to}} limit his flight schedule. The Rockets and White came to an agreement regarding travel, including allowing White travel by personal bus rather than flying (which has been an anxiety trigger in the past for white). White missed the first week of training camp before this agreement was put in place.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{opened a}} file on Oppenheimer in March 1941. It {{recorded}} that {{he attended a}} meeting in December 1940 at Chevalier's home that was also attended by the Communist Party's California state secretary William Schneiderman, and its treasurer Isaac Folkoff. The FBI noted that Oppenheimer was on the Executive Committee of the American Civil Liberties Union, which it considered a Communist front organization. Shortly thereafter, the FBI added Oppenheimer to its Custodial Detention Index, for arrest in case of national emergency. Debates over Oppenheimer's Party membership <b>or</b> <b>lack</b> <b>thereof</b> have turned on very fine points; almost all historians agree he had strong left-wing sympathies during this time and interacted with Party members, though there is considerable dispute over whether he was officially {{a member of the}} Party. At his 1954 security clearance hearings, he denied {{being a member of the}} Communist Party, but identified himself as a fellow traveler, which he defined as someone who agrees with many of the goals of Communism, but without being willing to blindly follow orders from any Communist party apparatus.|$|E
