6000|$|... "Seems we don't either <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>get</b> the dog," [...] Daughtry commented resignedly, when Captain Duncan had {{explained}} the situation.|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall neither <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>get</b> on by complaining;--shall we, Mr. Finn? You can {{let me have}} {{an answer}} perhaps by this time to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Both <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>get</b> a bath for one ticket, theater {{seat for}} one ticket, pew-rent {{is on the}} same basis, but at peep-shows we pay double." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (Three) That we conduct {{ourselves}} with Dignity and Discretion, {{and if one}} <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>gets</b> into trouble the other will stay by him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps it's best {{he should}} come," [...] Jack said. [...] "There {{will be no}} fear of being lost then, and if one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>gets</b> capsized, he can help him up again." ...|$|R
6000|$|Tony’s face relaxed, and he laughed. “That’s devilishly complimentary— but I’m coming. I’ve {{never been}} in a fight, and the {{sensation}} will be a pleasant novelty, but there’s something else. You see, it may happen that one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>gets</b> hurt.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Partly, I suppose, {{because a}} good many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>get</b> into scrapes before we enlist, and don't care for our friends {{to be able to}} trace us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{get nothing}} for your pains," [...] {{retorted}} Friche roughly. [...] "If {{you wait for}} her friends we may all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>get</b> as much as twenty francs each to hold our tongues." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Princess and Jeanne are here," [...] Cecil said. [...] "I don't {{suppose we}} shall either <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>get</b> near them. People {{are getting to}} know about Jeanne's little dot, and they are fairly mobbed everywhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|There's {{always this}} risk, mister, in being the Andy type of feller {{what must have}} his own way and goes {{straight}} ahead and has it; {{and that is that}} when trouble does come to him, it comes with a rush. It sometimes seems to me that in this life we've all got to have trouble sooner or later, and some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>gets</b> it bit by bit, spread out thin, so to speak, and a few <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>gets</b> it in a lump--biff! And that was what happened to Andy, and what I knew was going to happen when I showed him that letter. I nearly says to him, 'Brace up, young feller, because this is where you get it.' ...|$|R
60|$|This was so absurd that I {{tried to}} haggle a little; but I never succeeded in that line, so my attempt ended in both <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>getting</b> angry, {{when the little}} man tore the watch from my hands, and I left the shop as precipitately as I entered it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{remember}} all this, Margery, {{and see the}} necessity for all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>getting</b> back to the settlements {{as fast as we}} can. I don't half like this Peter; his name is a bad one in the garrisons, and it makes me miserable to think that you may be in his power." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{like to go}} myself," [...] added Dick, [...] "even if I had to stay ashore all night. Remember, the Josephine {{is on the way}} here, and {{the sooner}} some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>get</b> to land and locate that cave the better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that's so, but I guess most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>get</b> rusty. We {{land in a}} rut of {{obstetrics}} and typhoid and busted legs. What we need is women like you to jump on us. It'd be you that would transform the town." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Heythorp, we here {{represent}} about L14,000. When we had {{the pleasure}} of meeting you last July, you will recollect that you held out a prospect of some more satisfactory arrangement by Christmas. We are now in January, and I am bound to say we none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>get</b> younger." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Our {{grandmother}} {{came down}} from Detroit when our father died, and after mother passed, she kept all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> together at the house there -- instead <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>getting</b> separated," [...] Donald Stitch, the oldest child, remembered. [...] "She took us to church, worked day work, got Social Security, and we never wanted for anything. The lights were never turned out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you do, do you?" [...] snarled Ezra, {{taking a}} step forward, with a devilish gleam in his eyes. [...] "Your love may do him very little good. We shall see which <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>gets</b> the best <b>of</b> it in the long run. We'll--" [...] His passion was so furious that he stopped, fairly unable to {{articulate}} another word.|$|R
5000|$|.....scenes of sacristy, convents, monks, schools, {{of scenes}} where the {{penumbra}} {{of the church}} choir enlivened by flashes of red light from candles and lamps; he is a master at gathering the ecclesiastical countenance in people and things, and <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>getting</b> <b>us</b> to gather {{the sense of the}} sacred place which spreads with the smell of incense and light governed by the large hanging lamps." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen to me," [...] he said steadily, vainly {{striving to}} shake the vision of Joy Gastell's face from his brain. [...] "I sent that knife up {{for you to get}} out with. Get that? I'm going to chop loose with the jack-knife. It's one or both <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> <b>Get</b> that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Down, down! The {{cuttings}} {{were becoming}} precipitous cliffs, the drag made dismal groans; Aubrey, after a great slip forward, looking injured, anchored himself, {{with his feet}} against the seat, by Ethel; and Dr. Spencer was effectually wakened by an involuntary forward plunge of his opposite neighbour. 'Can this be safe?' quoth Ethel; 'should not some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>get</b> out?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Eliza {{eyed her}} curiously. [...] "Don't {{you go to}} countin' on this 'chivalry of the West' which story-writers put into books. These men out here will eat you up if you don't watch out. I wouldn't dare to leave you here alone. No, what I'll do is sell the place, if I can, and both <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>get</b> out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you do it, Zog!" [...] cried Trot indignantly, {{and turning}} to Cap'n Bill, she added, [...] "I'm not goin' to leave you down here in all this mess, Cap'n, and don't you think it. If one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>gets</b> out <b>of</b> the muddle we're in, we'll both get out, so don't you make any bargains with Zog to die twice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No use in all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>getting</b> wet," [...] he said. [...] "I don't {{think the}} damage amounts to much. A mud-guard is bent and the hood is {{scratched}} {{and the glass}} broken, but I guess that is all. But we'll {{have to get the}} limb from under the car before we can go ahead again," [...] he added, after an inspection.|$|R
6000|$|... "I lost my two {{greatest}} friends," [...] Desmond said. [...] "At least, I {{fear that}} both are dead. They {{were the two}} who escaped with me from the English prison. They, with Monsieur d'Eyncourt, another of Berwick's aides-de-camp, started with me to carry orders to the troops, who were all but surrounded by the enemy. We went by different roads, to increase the chances <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>getting</b> there.|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{the simple}} reason that you never get into a fast one, that you do not wear her fairly out, before you give her up. The Plantagenet, Sir Wycherly, is the fastest two-decker in His Majesty's service, and the vice-admiral knows it too well to let any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>get</b> foot in her, while her timbers will hang together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Egad," [...] said Colonel Clark, [...] "most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>get</b> by hard knocks {{what you}} seem to have been born with." [...] He fell to musing, a worried look coming on his face that was no {{stranger}} to me later, and his hand fell heavily on the loose pile of paper before him. [...] "Davy," [...] says he, [...] "I need a commissary-general." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{of us do}} it sometimes. All <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>get</b> jostled out of {{the line}} of {{profitable}} talk now and then. Mame put on that little lemon /glace/ smile that runs between ice and sugar, and says, much too pleasant: 'You're short on credentials for asking that question, Mr. Peters. Suppose you do a forty-nine day fast, just to give you ground to stand on, and then maybe I'll answer it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I enjoy it, or I shouldn't do it," [...] she retorted. [...] "It isn't {{the real}} thing, as I told you once. But none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>gets</b> the real thing. It's power.... Just as you enjoy what you're doing--sorting out the unfit. It's a game, it keeps us from {{brooding}} over things we can't help. And after all, {{when we have}} good appetites and are fairly happy, why should we complain?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let it be understood," [...] Philip continued, [...] "that if, {{when one}} <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>gets</b> round {{to the other}} side of the town, he should not meet the other party, and can hear no tidings of it, he shall gallop on till he meets it; for it is just possible, {{although}} I think it unlikely, that one or other <b>of</b> <b>us</b> may meet with so strong a party of the enemy as to be forced to stand on the defensive, until the other arrives." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We care," [...] {{said the}} captain, giving a shudder, {{as he looked}} upon the strangers. [...] "Their swords are sharp, and some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> would <b>get</b> hurt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I may alter {{this later}} on,' he said, 'but {{for the present}} I desire chiefly to place them beyond my son's reach. Please draw up the {{document}} at once, for {{no one can say}} what half an hour may bring forth to either <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> <b>Get</b> the document in form by this evening, when some friends will be here to witness it. Pray bring your two clerks also!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the loft}} of the mill. The officer is havin' a right sociable time with Essek Harland, an' if the miller's bottle holds out, I reckon them two won't be in shape {{to make much}} trouble. Jim is to say which of his party shall stay aboard, an' the sooner the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>get</b> to work the better, for I want to begin the {{scrimmage}} {{in a couple of}} hours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{the love}} that it can satisfy a woman either to receive or to give, {{especially}} the latter, for in this we are more blessed in giving than in receiving. It is but very rarely that the most fortunate <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>get</b> a chance of accepting such love as I mean, and we can only give it once in our lives. But you have not told me your reasons against my marrying Lord Minster." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'There,' {{he shouted}} in my ear. 'If either <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>gets</b> chucked well up, and the natives {{get a hold}} of him, the other must come up, too. Now mind, Ben, keep {{broadside}} on to the wave if you can, and let it roll you up as far as it will take you. Then, when you feel that its force is spent, stick your fingers and toes into the sand, and hold on like grim death.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess I'll {{let it go}} as you say, 'cause {{it would}} be hard luck for both <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to <b>get</b> 'rested and sent up to the Island." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bring him below," [...] Captain Seccombe commanded. [...] "And you, Mr. What's-your-name, {{lead the}} way. It's {{one or the}} other <b>of</b> <b>us</b> will <b>get</b> the hang of this affair." ...|$|R
