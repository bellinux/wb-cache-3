25|$|There are {{two main}} types of rock tumbling: barrel (rotary) tumbling, and {{vibratory}} tumbling. Rotary tumbling is more common, simpler, quieter and less expensive than vibratory tumblers. There are two differentiating factors, however, that may lead one to use a vibratory tumbler. First, vibratory tumbler retain the overall shape of the rough rock, whereas <b>rotary</b> <b>tumblers</b> tend to make rocks round. Thus, {{it is important to}} use vibratory tumbler to make faceted shapes and tear drop forms. Second, vibratory tumblers tend to process much faster than <b>rotary</b> <b>tumblers,</b> generally reducing the process time to half.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In 5 -axis NC machining, if the {{worktable}} rotary {{center or}} {{the cutting tool}} swivel center offset, in program blocks, the cutting tool position will also change and the compensation is needed. The author studies the mathematic relationship among the <b>rotary</b> center <b>offset</b> values, <b>rotary</b> angle A, B and C and the cutting tool position compensation values and designs the computer automatic processing algorithm which can rapidly and accurately calculate the compensation values for position change of the cutting tool and amend the cutting tool position in program blocks so as to obtain a practical NC program...|$|R
50|$|The first <b>rotary</b> <b>offset</b> lithographic {{printing}} press {{was created in}} England and patented in 1875 by Robert Barclay. This development combined mid-19th century transfer printing technologies and Richard March Hoe's 1843 rotary printing press—a press that used a metal cylinder instead of a flat stone. The offset cylinder was covered with specially treated cardboard that transferred the printed image from the stone {{to the surface of}} the metal. Later, the cardboard covering of the offset cylinder was changed to rubber, which is still the most commonly used material.|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{factors which}} the author {{believes}} could contribute to {{the determination of the}} aesthetic and economic viability of producing original fine art prints and artists books on a <b>rotary</b> <b>offset</b> press using direct imaged, uncoated lithographic plates. It also introduces a new medium for the creation and production of these works which was developed during this study. This investigation has been accomplished in the following ways: First, answers were sought to ten questions the author believed any artist considering the use of a <b>rotary</b> <b>offset</b> press as a means of producing these works would want to know. The answers were obtained through direct experimentation with a variety of plates which were processed by different procedures and then printed on a <b>rotary</b> <b>offset</b> press. The author concludes {{on the basis of this}} experimentation that when the artist 2 ̆ 7 s intentions for a specific work coincide with the capabilities of this production process as described in the answers, then this process can be considered aesthetically viable. Second, five-hundred copies of a sixteen page artists book were produced by the author to determine the aesthetic and economic viability of this production process for a specific work. The results indicated that a substantial saving in labor, time, and expense was obtained when this process was employed. There were also substantial savings to the integrity of the work. The author concludes that this process is aesthetically and economically viable for the production of this type of artists book. Third, a survey of commercial printers was undertaken to determine the aesthetic and economic viability of this process in cases where the artist does not have access to a suitable offset press. All the people interviewed indicated that their firms would be willing to accept for production plates imaged and processed by the artists. They also indicated that they would be willing to meet the artist 2 ̆ 7 s specifications for the work when these were obtainable, and that the total cost would be based principally on the hourly rate for the specific press being used. On the basis of these and other results of this survey, the author concludes that the production of original fine art prints and artists books by commercial lithographers can be aesthetically and economically viable for the production of certain works. Fourth, people professionally involved in the creation, printing, publishing, selling and collecting of these works were surveyed to assess their usage, awareness, and attitudes regarding their offset press production. The response data to one question in the survey allowed calculations to be made of the acceptability of this process to the total population of the types of people surveyed. As a result of these calculations, conclusions were made that seventy-six percent believe this process is acceptable for the production of original fine art prints. Similarly, one-hundred percent believe it is acceptable for the production of artists books. And fifth, the origins, principles, processing procedures, advantages, and disadvantages of a new medium for the creation and production of original prints and artists books are presented. This medium utilizes direct imaging techniques and light sensitive coated lithographic plates. It is presented for the first time in this study. Any artist wishing to learn about this new medium and any artist considering <b>rotary</b> <b>offset</b> production of original fine art prints or artists books, will find much useful in formation in this study. A portfolio of thirty prints accompanies this study to provide the reader with a firsthand view of the results of the experimentation...|$|R
40|$|During the Apollo program, {{the space}} suit outer layer fabrics were badly abraded {{after just a}} few Extravehicular Activities (EVAs). For example, the Apollo 12 {{commander}} reported abrasive wear on the boots, which penetrated the outer layer fabric into the thermal protection layers after less than eight hours of surface operations. Current plans for the Constellation Space Suit Element require the space suits to support hundreds of hours of EVA on the Lunar surface, creating a challenge for space suit designers to utilize materials advances made over the last forty years and improve upon the space suit fabrics used in the Apollo program. A test methodology has been developed by the NASA Johnson Space Center Crew and Thermal Systems Division for establishing comparative abrasion wear characteristics between various candidate space suit outer layer fabrics. The abrasion test method incorporates a large <b>rotary</b> drum <b>tumbler</b> with rocks and loose lunar simulant material to induce abrasion in fabric test cylinder elements, representative of what might occur during long term planetary surface EVAs. Preliminary materials screening activities were conducted to determine the degree of wear on representative space suit outer layer materials and the corresponding dust permeation encountered between subsequent sub -layers of thermal protective materials when exposed to a simulated worst case eight hour EVA. The test method was used to provide a preliminary evaluation of four candidate outer layer fabrics for future planetary surface space suit applications. This Paper provides a review of previous abrasion studies on space suit fabrics, details the methodologies used for abrasion testing in this particular study, and shares the results and conclusions of the testing...|$|R
5000|$|Two years earlier, in 1871, the two {{engineers}} Louis Faber and Adolf Schleicher {{founded the}} company Faber & Schleicher as an “Association for Production of Automatic Lithographic Presses” in Offenbach am Main. This city {{has played a}} very important part in the history of lithography because it was here that Alois Senefelder built his first lithographic stone presses for the André music publishing company. Faber & Schleicher built their first automatic litho stone press in 1879, the “Albatros”, which had an output of 600 to 700 sheets per hour. Along with the experience and know-how gained from lithography as well as printing on zinc and other metal plates, the real breakthrough came with the emergence of offset printing {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century. The inventors Ira Washington Rubel and Caspar Herrmann took over the indirect printing principle known from printing on metal plate and developed this new process between 1904 and 1907. Faber & Schleicher’s specialization in offset printing began in 1911 with the model “Roland”, the world’s first sheetfed <b>rotary</b> <b>offset</b> press, which was awarded a gold medal at the World Fair in Turin.The name Roland was chosen because [...] "Faber & Schleicher" [...] can hardly be pronounced in English-speaking regions.|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} {{printing}} {{is dominated by}} studies of mechanical typography. In this thesis the role of lithography in modernising printing is presented as an alternative path. The conventional explanation of how different printing processes work is generally made by dividing them into relief, intaglio and planographic processes. This explanation is of questionable value now, {{in a world where}} digital pre-press and offset printing hold sway. It is an outmoded idea to think that different ways of delivering ink under pressure {{is at the core of}} printing. Instead, it is more useful to focus our attention on the role played by direct and indirect image transfer. The similarities between the uses made by Gutenberg and Senefelder of direct and indirect image transfer has a greater importance than has the simplified division of printing processes into classes based upon depth of impression which is, essentially, a mechanical idea grounded in the typographic tradition. The idea presented here is that Gutenberg's application of indirect image transfer in his invention of moveable type provoked changes of greater importance than did the alternative invention of printing illustrations directly from metal plates or wooden blocks. Similarly, direct lithography was transformed by Senefelder into a vehicle for indirect image transfer by the invention of lithographic transfer paper. This invention had important ramifications for the future of lithography and for the preservation of photographic images. The combination of chemical printing and indirect image transfer made the capture of photographic images possible for the first time. In the nineteenth century, lithography also provided the first means by which photographs could be reproduced with printing ink in books - typography following here rather than leading the way. These issues have not been clearly recognised by many. The widely acknowledged superiority of typography to print economically, sharply, and at speed, was not surpassed by lithographers (who tended to concentrate on technical illustration and decorative printing) for many years. It was not until indirect image transfer was applied to the lithographic press that this barrier to progress was overcome, and, at last, text and image were efficiently transferred photographically to the <b>rotary</b> <b>offset</b> press...|$|R
