5|$|A comet may be {{discovered}} photographically using a wide-field telescope or visually with binoculars. However, even {{without access to}} <b>optical</b> <b>equipment,</b> {{it is still possible}} for the amateur astronomer to discover a sungrazing comet online by downloading images accumulated by some satellite observatories such as SOHO. SOHO's 2000th comet was discovered by Polish amateur astronomer Michał Kusiak on 26 December 2010 and both discoverers of Hale-Bopp used amateur equipment (although Hale was not an amateur).|$|E
5|$|Because {{germanium}} is transparent in {{the infrared}} wavelengths, {{it is an important}} infrared optical material that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14micron range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile night vision, and fire fighting applications. It is used in infrared spectroscopes and other <b>optical</b> <b>equipment</b> that require extremely sensitive infrared detectors. It has a very high refractive index (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of diamond-like carbon (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse.|$|E

25|$|Although {{technology}} such as electronics have improved, <b>optical</b> <b>equipment</b> such as rangefinders and ballistic calculators {{have eliminated}} manual mathematical calculations to determine elevation and windage, {{the fundamentals of}} accurate and precise long-range shooting {{are the same as}} throughout the history of shooting, and the skill and training of the shooter and his spotter where applicable are the primary factors.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, stock market speculators, hoping that Nortel would reap {{increasingly}} lucrative {{profits from the}} sale of fibre optic network gear, began pushing up the company's share price to unheard-of levels despite the company's repeated failure to turn a profit. Under the leadership of CEO John Roth, sales of <b>optical</b> <b>equipment</b> had been robust in the late 1990s, but the market was soon saturated.

Some of them struck Israeli minefields. The Israeli forces did not have adequate <b>optical</b> <b>equipment</b> for night fighting, and had to gauge the position of the Syrian forces by their noise and artillery flares. Nafshi's battalion kept changing positions to avoid tank hunters. The fortifications were under heavy attack by tanks and infantry and were calling for help. Nafshi told them to go underground and provided them with supporting artillery fire.|$|E
25|$|Birefringence {{is used in}} many optical devices. Liquid-crystal displays, {{the most}} common sort of flat panel display, cause their pixels to become lighter or darker through {{rotation}} of the polarization (circular birefringence) of linearly polarized light as viewed through a sheet polarizer at the screen's surface. Similarly, light modulators modulate the intensity of light through electrically induced birefringence of polarized light followed by a polarizer. The Lyot filter is a specialized narrowband spectral filter employing the wavelength dependence of birefringence. Wave plates are thin birefringent sheets widely used in certain <b>optical</b> <b>equipment</b> for modifying the polarization state of light passing through it.|$|E
500|$|The Olympus scandal was precipitated on 14 October 2011 when British-born Michael Woodford was {{suddenly}} ousted {{as chief executive}} of international <b>optical</b> <b>equipment</b> manufacturer Olympus Corporation.

500|$|The {{powerful}} central {{light source}} creates a chiaroscuro effect. The light illuminating the scene {{has been described}} as [...] "so brilliant it could only be the light of revelation". The single source of light is obscured behind the bowl on the table; some hint of a lamp glass can be seen {{around the side of the}} bowl, but David Hockney has suggested that the bowl itself may contain sulphur, giving a powerful single light source that a candle or oil lamp would not. In the earlier study a candle holder is visible, and the flame is reflected in the bowl. Hockney believes that many of the Old Masters used <b>optical</b> <b>equipment</b> to assist in their painting, and suggests that Wright may have used lenses to transfer the image to paper rather than painting directly from the scene, as he believes the pattern of shadows thrown by the lighting could have been too complicated for Wright to have captured so accurately without assistance. It may be observed, however, that the stand on which the pump is situated casts no shadow on the body of the philosopher, as it could be expected to do.|$|E

2500|$|PT-76E - This is {{the most}} recent PT-76 {{modernization}} program. It increases the vehicle's battle efficiency by including a radical growth in firepower, which required a new turret AU-220M and other weapons. This variant is armed with a 57mm autocannon (which is a modification of the 57mm L/76.6 S-60 AA gun. It was developed by CB Burevestnik (Nizhniy Novgorod). Its armor-piercing tracer rounds fired from 1,120 m can penetrate 100mm of steel armor. The new weapon can destroy most modern APCs and IFVs. It can also engage aerial targets out to 6km. The autocannon uses two types of ammunition, splinter-tracer and armor-piercing-tracer. However, {{it is possible to}} fire a special zenith shell. The gun can fire single shots, short bursts (2 to 5 rounds), or long bursts (up to 20 rounds). It can also fire continuously up to 120 rounds per minute. This system functions by using the energy generated by each round, not by using an external power source. Firepower is improved 5.5 times in the PT-76E over the PT-76B. The PT-76E is fitted with a more powerful UTD-20 6-cylinder 4-stroke V-shaped airless-injection water-cooled multifuel 15.8 litre diesel engine. It develops 300hp (224kW) at 2,600rpm and is taken from the BMP-1 as is the transmission. The power-to-weight ratio has been improved to [...] per ton. This also increases the maximum road speed from 44km/h to 60km/h, with an average cross country speed from 32km/h to 42km/h. Other engine options are the UTD-23 or V-6BF. The vehicle has new tracks. Driver fatigue has been reduced. The vehicle's survivability on the battlefield is improved with the introduction of a new fast-acting firefighting system. The vehicle also has improvements in fire control and <b>optical</b> <b>equipment,</b> for instance the new sights 1P67 and [...] "Liga-S". This modernization program increases the PT-76's performance by 2.7 times, which is still comparatively low. The vehicle was accepted by the Russian marines in 2006 and about 40 or 50 vehicles were ordered.|$|E
