5|$|HD is one {{of several}} trinucleotide repeat {{disorders}} which are caused by the length of a repeated section of a gene exceeding a normal range. The HTT gene is located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> arm of chromosome 4 at 4p16.3. HTT contains a sequence of three DNA bases—cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG)—repeated multiple times (i.e.... CAGCAGCAG...), known as a trinucleotide repeat. CAG is the 3-letter genetic code (codon) for the amino acid glutamine, so a series of them results in the production of a chain of glutamine known as a polyglutamine tract (or polyQ tract), and the repeated part of the gene, the PolyQ region.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, King {{appeared}} {{with a small}} role as Heather in the comedy The Alibi and a starring role in the thriller True True Lie.

Neil Graf was tasked with coloring, Julian Narino was the background designer, and Adam Muto drew the props. Graf and Narino later got jobs with other series and studios—King of the Hill and Laika studio, respectively—but Muto continued working with Ward and eventually became Adventure Times co-executive producer and showrunner. The finished short ran for seven minutes, and production {{wrapped up in the}} spring of 2006.|$|E
5|$|An {{association}} with the folliculin (FLCN) gene was first reported in 2002. This 14-exon gene is located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> arm of chromosome 17 (17p11.2) and has a cytosine-rich region in exon 11 particularly susceptible to mutation. The most common mutation in this region is the insertion or deletion of a cytosine residue, found in 53% of Birt–Hogg–Dubé families. There is {{no significant difference in}} the symptoms experienced by families with an insertion at that location compared to those who have a deletion. However, mutations in FLCN associated with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are heterogeneous, and are often nonsense mutations or frameshift mutations that cause early truncation of the protein product at the carboxy-terminus. Very rarely, missense mutations are observed. Mutations are often passed from one generation to the next in an autosomal dominant fashion but can occur as a new mutation in an individual with no prior family history (a de novo mutation). The children of an affected parent each have a 50% chance of having the disease. Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome has very high penetrance. A correlation between different FLCN genotypes and phenotypes has not been discovered.|$|E
5|$|In November 1791, a French convoy sailed from Mahé <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> {{journey to}} Mangalore. The convoy {{included}} two merchant vessels and the frigate Résolue, a 36-gun warship under Captain Callamand. Passing northwards, the convoy soon passed Tellicherry and Cornwallis sent Strachan with Phoenix and Perseverance {{to stop and}} inspect the French ships to ensure they were not carrying military supplies. As Smith halted the merchant ships and sent boats to inspect them, Strachan did the same to Résolue, hailing the French captain and placing an officer in a small boat to board the frigate. The French captain was outraged at this violation of his neutrality, and responded by opening fire: British sources suggest that his initial target was the small boat, although Phoenix was the ship most immediately damaged.|$|E

5|$|On 13 June 1905, a {{passenger}} service began <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> branch to South Acton. A short fifth {{platform for the}} single car train of the South Acton branch was provided {{to the north of}} the eastbound island platform. At first the service ran to Hounslow West and to Uxbridge but it was later reduced to a shuttle between Acton Town and South Acton on 15 February 1932. The South Acton branch was closed on 28 February 1959 due to low usage; its platform at Acton Town has not been removed and is still visible. The platform is hidden behind advertising hoardings and not obvious to the casual observer. Much of the branch remains including a bridge support on the south side of Bollo Lane. In the picture, the area behind the hoarding in the background is the location of the former branch platform (Platform 5) which was only ever very short, two carriages at most.|$|E
5|$|Other {{candidates}} {{being considered}} for the position included National League president Ford Frick, Democratic National Committee chairman Robert E. Hannegan, former Postmaster General James Farley, US Senator John W. Bricker, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, former federal judge Fred M. Vinson, Ohio Governor Frank Lausche, and Undersecretary of War Robert P. Patterson. After Cincinnati Reds owner Warren Giles and Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley raised strong opposition to Frick, formerly the front runner, New York Yankees co-owner Larry MacPhail began to advocate for Chandler. When the owners met in Cleveland, Ohio on April 24, 1945 {{to vote for a}} new commissioner, Chandler's name was not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> list; the candidates were Frick, Farley, Hannegan, Vinson, Lausche, and Patterson. None of the candidates received the required two-thirds majority, and after lobbying by MacPhail and New York Giants owner Horace Stoneham, the owners took an informal vote to see if anyone had the potential to be elected. Chandler's name appeared in the top three on each of the sixteen ballots. Encouraged, the owners then held another formal vote. After two ballots, Chandler received the necessary majority; a third vote was taken to make the choice unanimous.|$|E
5|$|The LDL {{receptor}} gene {{is located}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> arm of chromosome 19 (19p13.1-13.3). It comprises 18 exons and spans 45 kb, and the protein gene product contains 839 amino acids in mature form. A single abnormal copy (heterozygote) of FH causes cardiovascular disease {{by the age}} of 50 in about 40% of cases. Having two abnormal copies (homozygote) causes accelerated atherosclerosis in childhood, including its complications. The plasma LDL levels are inversely related to the activity of LDL receptor (LDLR). Homozygotes have LDLR activity of less than 2%, while heterozygotes have defective LDL processing with receptor activity being 2–25%, depending {{on the nature of the}} mutation. Over 1000 different mutations are known.|$|E

5|$|The Syriac, Jonah, who {{had helped}} Khalid enter the city by the East Gate, showed him a {{short-cut}} to Antioch. Leading a cavalry regiment, Khalid caught up with a convoy of Byzantine refugees from Damascus at the sea, near Antioch. The three-day truce had passed; Khalid's cavalry attacked the convoy during a heavy rain. In the subsequent battle, Khalid reportedly killed both Thomas and Harbees in a duel. After the Battle, known as the Battle of Marj-ud-Deebaj (Battle of Brocade Meadow), the Muslims took {{a great amount of}} brocade as booty. In addition, Thomas' wife, the daughter of Heraclius, was captured. According to chronicles, the Greek man Jonah, who guided Khalid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> cut to Antioch, got his fiance, but she committed suicide. Khalid offered Jonah the daughter of Emperor Heraclius, whom he refused. Khalid sent her back to her father. Jonah died two years later in the Battle of Yarmuk.|$|E
5|$|The advent in {{the mid-1990s}} of ’no-frills’ carriers, such as easyJet, has had a {{significant}} impact on air travel in the UK. In 2005 these airlines carried 77.5million passengers, up from just 4.3million in 1996. They are responsible for the growth of regional airports, operating from 35 airports in 2006 compared to 10 in 1996, and increasing the choice of international destinations, serving 150 in 2006, compared to 12 a decade earlier. The annual rate of growth in the overall demand for air travel has remained stable since 1975, averaging 5.8 per cent annually. Recent growth is being serviced by the no-frills airlines at the expense of traditional carriers which, since 2000, have experienced flat or declining traffic levels. In response, traditional carriers have lowered costs to compete more effectively on price, leading to lower prices <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> haul routes serviced by this sector, especially in business fares. They have also limited or reduced capacity and in some cases launched no-frills subsidiaries of their own.|$|E

Of particular focus are the romantic relationships between Nagisa and Shizuma Hanazono and between Hikari and Amane Ōtori. The series culminates in {{the election of the}} new Etoile pairing, although this aspect of the story is downplayed compared to the manga. Fan service, or giving appealing visuals of the girls nude or in provocative situations, is seen in the anime, but only briefly.|$|E
