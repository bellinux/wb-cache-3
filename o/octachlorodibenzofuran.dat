40|$|A median {{mortality}} of 120 ± 30 days occurred among juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), fed dry fish food containing 2. 7, 5. 7, 2. 8, and 9. 1 uMg/g wet weight of 2, 8 di-, tri-, tetra-, and <b>octachlorodibenzofuran,</b> respectively (1). Only octachlorodibenzofuranx was {{detected in the}} dead fish, and the level was 0. 03 ug/g in the muscle and 0. 21,Ag/g in the gut (both values on wet weight basis). The fate of the lower chlorinated dibenzofurans was not known and additional experiments, described in this paper, were carried out with immature brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), fed relatively high levels of 2, 8 -dichlorodibenzofuran. Experimental The preparation of 2, 8 -dichlorodibenzofuran was carried out as described (2). Three crystallizations were necessary to remove tri- and tetrachlorodibenzofuran from the product...|$|E
40|$|The {{procedure}} used {{to determine}} polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated terphenyls (PCTs), chlorinated dibenzodioxins, and chlorinated dibenzofurans is outlined in Table 1. It {{is based on the}} cleanup-chromatography of Holden and Marsden (1), modified as described (2). Most PCBs are eluted in fraction I. Fraction II contains some PCBs, p, p'-DDE, and PCTs, whereas heptachlor exposide, dieldrin, endrin, p,p'-DDD, and p, p'-DDT are eluted in fraction III. Fractions I and II are further chromatographed on alumina, essentially according to Porter and Burke (3), to determine chlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans. PCTs, hexa- and octachlorodibenzodioxin, and <b>octachlorodibenzofuran</b> were quantified by gas chromatography on 3 % OV- 210 on Chromosorb WAW 60 / 80 in a 6 ft X 4 mm column at 200 °C. A 4 % SE- 30 column was used to quantify PCBs, chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides, 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, di-, tri-, and tetrachlorodibenzofuran. Recovery of PCBs and chlorinated hydrocarbo...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} thermal {{decomposition}} of technical endosulfan under oxidative {{conditions and the}} subsequent formation of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/F, dioxins), and their precursors. Both quantum chemical calculations and laboratory experiments were employed to investigate the pathways of oxidation of endosulfan. The laboratory scale apparatus used consists of a tubular reactor and product collection system and analysis train. The results report the effect of temperature (523 – 923 K) and O₂ concentration on PCDD/F formation in a N₂ bath gas at a residence time of 5 s. The decomposition of endosulfan produces two types of PCDD/F precursors, involving all chlorinated benzenes (CBz) and chlorinated phenols (CPh). Oxidation of endosulfan favors the formation of PCDF over PCDD. <b>Octachlorodibenzofuran</b> is the most abundant homologue group detected in all experiments. The maximum emission factor for PCDD/F was observed at 923 K and O₂ content of 6 % and corresponds to 64 ng TEQ-WHO 2005 per mg of endosulfan and a total dioxin concentration of 1131 ng/mg of endosulfan...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{degradation}} of dioxins by white rot fungi was developed. Degradation of a mixture of 10 kinds of tetra- to octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins [PCDDs]) and tetra- to <b>octachlorodibenzofurans</b> (polychlorinated dibenzofurans [PCDFs]), which were chlorinated at 2 -, 3 -, 7 -, and 8 -positions of the molecules, by the white rot fungus Phanerochaete sordida YK- 624 was studied in a stationary low-nitrogen medium. The percent degradation values of PCDDs and PCDFs were approximately 40 (tetra-chloro-) to 76 % (hexachloro-) and 45 (tetrachloro-) to 70 % (hexachloro-), respectively. Metabolites of 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetra- and octaCDD formed by P. sordida YK- 624 included 4, 5 -dichlorocatechol and tetrachlorocatechol, respectively. These results suggest that white rot fungus is able to substantially degrade both PCDDs and PCDFs. This is the first report of {{the degradation of}} highly chlorinated PCDDs and PCDFs by a microorganism...|$|R
40|$|A deeper {{understanding}} of the microbial community structure is very important in bioremediation for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). However, this has been insufficiently addressed in previous studies. To obtain more information, we pyrosequenced the V 4 /V 5 regions of the 16 S rRNA genes of bacterial communities transited from polluted soil to batch microcosms that rapidly degraded high concentrations of <b>octachlorodibenzofuran</b> (OCDF). The analysis results contained an average of 11, 842 reads per sample, providing the first detailed description of bacterial communities associated with PCDD/Fs. The community composition markedly changed to be concomitant with the degradation of OCDF, indicating that a distinctive population structure developed rapidly in the microcosm. Although oxygen gas was provided weekly to the microcosm, the growth of potential degraders, Sphingomonas, Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus, and Clostridium, was observed, but in consistently low quantities. While anaerobic Sedimentibacter initially emerged as an abundant pioneer, several aerobic participants, such as the genera Brevundimonas, Pseudoxanthomonas, and Lysobacter, exhibited a large increase in their 16 S rRNA gene copies within the timeframe, which showed a temporal population dynamic, and indicated their collaborative contributions to the degradation of OCDF under hypoxic conditions. These results have provided a deeper insight into the microbial community structure and population dynamics of the OCDF-degrading microcosm...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] The {{production}} of magnesium {{is a well}} known source of both aliphatic and aromatic chlorinated compounds, among others the polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs). The {{aim of this study}} was to establish whether increased concentrations of PCDDs and PCDFs could be found in the blood of workers in a magnesium plant. METHODS [...] Blood plasma from 10 workers, employed at a magnesium plant for 10 to 36 years, and from a control group consisting of nine people who had no direct contact with the production were studied. Isomer specific analyses of PCDDs and PCDFs by means of high resolution gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS) techniques were performed. RESULTS [...] A significant increase was found in the concentrations of some of the congeners, mainly PCDFs, in the workers compared with the control group. <b>Octachlorodibenzofuran</b> (OCDF) is the congener that most strongly correlates with occupational exposure in the magnesium plant. Low concentrations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 -heptachlorodibenzofuran were found in seven of the workers. Such isomers [...] that is, not 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted [...] are rarely found in human samples. CONCLUSION [...] Due to the long biological half lives and lipid solubility of PCDDs and PCDFs, blood analyses may serve as an index of past cumulative occupational exposure and a means of assessing a person's exposure situation...|$|E
40|$|Secondary copper {{smelting}} (SeCu) {{is widely}} {{considered to be an}} important source of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDDs and PCDFs; PCDD/Fs). Laboratory experiments were performed using SeCu fly ash as a matrix for thermochemical reactions to investigate the effects of fly ash on the formation of PCDD/Fs and the potential mechanisms. Thermochemical reactions on SeCu fly ash over a temperature range of 250 - 450 A degrees C and reaction times of 10 - 120 min caused the PCDD/F concentrations in the fly ash to increase significantly. The PCDD/F concentrations formed in the thermal reactions were about 99 - 139 times higher than the PCDD/F concentrations in the original fly ash, clearly indicating that fly ash promoted the formation of PCDD/Fs. The PCDFs dominated the PCDDs, and the PCDF/PCDD concentration ratio was about 30 - 40. <b>Octachlorodibenzofuran</b> (OCDF), octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, and the heptachlorodibenzofurans were the most dominant homologs that were formed. A comparison of the PCDD/F patterns produced in the thermochemical reactions and the patterns in the original fly ash suggested that the chlorination of less chlorinated PCDFs might be an important pathway in the formation of higher chlorinated furans. The results of this study indicated that SeCu fly ash has a high PCDD/F formation potential. It is crucial to have the fly ash filter at low temperature and that fly ash in the cooling system should be minimized...|$|E
40|$|In June 2005, a World Health Organization (WHO) -International Programme on Chemical Safety expert {{meeting was}} held in Geneva during which the toxic {{equivalency}} factors (TEFs) for dioxin-like compounds, including some polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), were reevaluated. For this reevaluation process, the refined TEF database recently published by Haws et al. (2006, Toxicol. Sci. 89, 4 - 30) {{was used as a}} starting point. Decisions about a TEF value were made based on a combination of unweighted relative effect potency (REP) distributions from this database, expert judgment, and point estimates. Previous TEFs were assigned in increments of 0. 01, 0. 05, 0. 1, etc., but for this reevaluation, it was decided to use half order of magnitude increments on a logarithmic scale of 0. 03, 0. 1, 0. 3, etc. Changes were decided by the expert panel for 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 -pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF) (TEF = 0. 3), 1, 2, 3, 7, 8 -pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF) (TEF = 0. 03), octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and <b>octachlorodibenzofuran</b> (TEFs = 0. 0003), 3, 4, 4 ′, 5 -tetrachlorbiphenyl (PCB 81) (TEF = 0. 0003), 3, 3 ′, 4, 4 ′, 5, 5 ′-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB 169) (TEF = 0. 03), and a single TEF value (0. 00003) for all relevant mono-ortho-substituted PCBs. Additivity, an important prerequisite of the TEF concept was again confirmed by results from recent in vivo mixture studies. Some experimental evidence shows that non-dioxin-like aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonists/antagonists are able to impact the overall toxic potency of 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and related compounds, and this needs to be investigated further. Certain individual and groups of compounds were identified for possible future inclusion in the TEF concept, including 3, 4, 4 ′-TCB (PCB 37), polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, mixed polyhalogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, polyhalogenated naphthalenes, and polybrominated biphenyls. Concern was expressed about direct application of the TEF/total toxic equivalency (TEQ) approach to abiotic matrices, such as soil, sediment, etc., for direct application in human risk assessment. This is problematic as the present TEF scheme and TEQ methodology are primarily intended for estimating exposure and risks via oral ingestion (e. g., by dietary intake). A number of future approaches to determine alternative or additional TEFs were also identified. These included the use of a probabilistic methodology to determine TEFs that better describe the associated levels of uncertainty and "systemic” TEFs for blood and adipose tissue and TEQ for body burde...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES—To find whether {{concentrations}} of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) in serum increased in workers at municipal incinerators that burn continuously.  METHODS— 30 Workers employed at three municipal {{waste incineration plants}} (incinerator workers) and 30  control workers were studied. The incinerator workers had worn dust masks or airline masks during the periodic repair work inside the incinerators. Previous job, dietary habit, smoking habit, distance from residence to the incineration plant, and body weight and height were obtained from a questionnaire survey. Concentrations of PCDDs/PCDFs were measured in the serum of the workers and the dust deposited in the plants. The influence of various factors on serum {{concentrations of}} PCDDs/PCDFs was examined by multiple regression analysis.  RESULTS—Dust analysis showed {{the greatest amount of}} octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD), followed by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (HpCDD), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -heptachlorodibenzofuran (HpCDF), and <b>octachlorodibenzofuran</b> (OCDF). The toxicity equivalents (TEQs) of PCDDs and PCDFs in the deposited dust were 4. 8,  1. 0, and 6. 4  ng TEQs/g, respectively, for plants A, B, and C.  The mean serum TEQs of PCDDs and PCDFs in the incinerator workers and control workers were 19. 2  and 22. 9  pg TEQs/g lipid, respectively, for area A, 28. 8  and 24. 5  pg TEQs/g lipid for area B, and 23. 4  and 23. 6  pg TEQs/g lipid for area C.  No {{significant differences were found between}} the incinerator workers and the controls for TEQs of PCDDs and PCDFs separately, and TEQs of PCDDs and PCDFs together. However, the serum 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -HpCDF concentration was significantly higher in the incinerator workers than in the controls for all the three areas. When the exposure index to 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -HpCDF is defined as the product of the concentration of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -HpCDF in the deposited dust and duration of employment, the concentration of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -HpCDF in serum increased as the exposure index increased. Multivariate analysis suggested that the serum concentration of HpCDF increased with duration of employment at the incineration plants and OCDF increased with employment of ⩾ 21 years. The other significant variables (p< 0. 01 or p< 0. 001) were area for hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (HxCDD) and tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF), Brinkman index for HpCDD, and body mass index (BMI) for tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), HpCDD, and TEQs of PCDDs.  CONCLUSION—The serum TEQs of PCDDs and PCDFs was not significantly higher among the incinerator workers, but the serum concentration of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -HpCDF was. This suggests that the incinerator workers had inhaled dust containing PCDDs and PCDFs while working in plants equipped with incinerators that burn continuously.    Keywords: serum dioxins; municipal waste incinerators; continuous burning; heptachlorodibenzofura...|$|E
