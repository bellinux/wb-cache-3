40|$|The use of {{information}} <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> has increased in the society, and {{can be useful in}} nursing care. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe district nurses' attitudes regarding the implementation {{of information}} <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> in home nursing. The first and third authors performed five focus group discussions with 19 district nurses' from five primary healthcare centres in northern Sweden. During the focus group discussions, the following topics were discussed: the current and future {{use of information}} <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> in home nursing; expectations, advantages, disadvantages and hindrances in the use of information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> in home nursing; and the use of information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> from an ethical perspective. The transcribed focus group discussions were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The results showed that district nurses' attitudes were positive regarding the use of information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> in their work. They also asked for possibilities to influence the design and its introduction. However, the use of information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> in home nursing can be described as a complement to communication that could not replace human physical encounters. Improvements and risks, as well as the importance of physical presence in home nursing were considered vital. The results revealed that the use of information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> requires changes in the district nurses' work situation.

Followed by a short historical overview of the application of information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> in educational processes. In the empirical part the results of the research are presented, which I conducted in the elementary school with pupils from sixth grade in home economics class. Pedagogical experiment lasted fourteen days, pupils were split into two groups – the control and the experimental group. In the control group they were repeating the home economics subject matter using the worksheet, and in the experimental group they were solving a quiz, which was accessible on the internet. My purpose was to find out what students think about the usage of information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> for teaching, <b>and</b> whether they consider classes more interesting, if we put it in the teaching process. I also tried to determine whether the pupils repeating the subject matter with the help of information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> will better remember the subject matter. I found that pupils, who repeated the subject matter in home economics with the use of information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology,</b> achieved a better result in the examination, and also remembered the subject matter better. In integrating information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> in home economics class it is necessary to be aware that the pupils wish to use information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> more frequently, <b>and</b> that they find teaching with the help of computer in home economics class more interesting than frontal methods of teaching. Therefore, the integration of information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> in home economics class makes sense. ...|$|R

The Federal State Educational Standards for elementary education calls for developing pupils’ motivation sphere at every lesson and in each school subject. There is a system of means of developing pupils’ learning motivation which were elaborated in pedagogy and psychology but modern education places special emphasis on information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technologies.</b> The purpose of the research is to define pedagogical and psychological conditions of using information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technologies</b> {{as a means of}} develop a pupil's learning motivation in elementary school. We supposed that there were three main conditions: the first one is to use information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technologies</b> at different stages of a lesson; the second one is to teach pupils to make use of these technologies; the third is to have pupils use information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technologies</b> in educational activity without assistance. We made our research with the primary goal to examine conditions during complex experimental work in elementary school. According to the results, we made a system of lessons using information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technologies</b> at different stages of lessons and teach pupils how to use these technologies on their own.

40|$|Aim: This paper {{profiles}} a {{study that}} explored nursing students’ information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> competence <b>and</b> confidence. It presents selected findings that focus on students’ attitudes towards information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> as an educational methodology and their perceptions of its relevance to clinical practice. Background: Information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> is integral to contemporary nursing practice. Development of these skills is important to ensure that graduates are ‘work ready’ and adequately prepared to practice in increasingly technological healthcare environments. Methods: This was a mixed methods study. Students (n = 971) from three Australian universities were surveyed using an instrument designed specifically for the study, and 24 students participated in focus groups. Findings: The focus group data revealed {{that a number of}} students were resistant to the use of information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> as an educational methodology and lacked the requisite skills and confidence to engage successfully with this educational approach. Survey results indicated that 26 per cent of students were unsure about the relevance of information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> to clinical practice and only 50 per cent felt ’very confident’ using a computer. Conclusion: While the importance of information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> to student’s learning and to their preparedness for practice has been established, it is evident that students’ motivation is influenced by their level of confidence and competence, and their understanding of the relevance of information <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> to their future careers...|$|R
