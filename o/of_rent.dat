5|$|In 1851, the Liberals gained {{office on}} Prince Edward Island. They {{immediately}} went about putting in place measures to gradually dismantle the proprietor/tenant system, although their efforts generally had limited effect largely because Samuel Cunard, who owned one-sixth of the Island, refused to sell {{any of his}} land. In 1864, the tenants organised into the Tenant League, and vowed to resist the collection <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> by their proprietors. Efforts by law enforcement to quell this rebellion had little effect, so {{the government of the}} island requested the assistance of British troops to enforce the collection <b>of</b> <b>rent.</b> In 1865, British troops arrived in the colony and successfully enforced the collection of the unpaid rent, and the Tenant League crumbled. It appeared that the operation of the Tenant League was a matter of principle rather than practical necessity; the rent paid by tenants to the proprietors was to the amount of one shilling per acre, and the proprietors allowed rent to go unpaid for years at a time.|$|E
40|$|This Article {{explores the}} {{problems}} {{arising from the}} use of the absolute assignment <b>of</b> <b>rents</b> in mortgage loan transactions, which have continued for over a century, as well as possible solutions. Rents are {{a significant part of the}} security for loans secured by income-producing properties such as office buildings, shopping centers, and apartments. Under present law in many states, the absolute assignment <b>of</b> <b>rents</b> is the only means by which lenders can create an effective security interest in <b>rents</b> <b>of</b> mortgaged property. An absolute assignment <b>of</b> <b>rents</b> purports to transfer title to rents to the mortgage lender although in substance it creates a security interest in rents. The Article explores the historical development of the absolute assignment <b>of</b> <b>rents</b> and discusses the confusion, unnecessary litigation, and even injustice that it causes under state law and in bankruptcy. The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws has recently approved the new Uniform Assignment <b>of</b> <b>Rents</b> Act, which removes the necessity for absolute assignments <b>of</b> <b>rents</b> by creating a workable and comprehensive scheme for the creation of security interests in rents. The Article concludes by discussing the Act and recommending its adoption...|$|R

5|$|In 1979, two Michigan businessmen, John Rudzewicz and Brian MacShara, {{entered into}} a {{franchise}} agreement with Burger King to run a restaurant in Detroit, Michigan. After MacShara attended four months of training courses at the regional Burger King training facilities in Michigan and in the Florida headquarters on how to operate and administer a Burger King franchise, {{it was agreed that}} the partners would take over operation of an existing Burger King location in Drayton Plains, Michigan. However, during this time disagreements arose between the partners and Burger King over issues <b>of</b> <b>rent,</b> construction fees, building designs and the assignment of legal liabilities. MacShara and Ruzewicz finally signed their franchise agreement after gaining limited concessions over the issues, with Rudzewicz assuming a 20-year, $1,000,000 financial obligation {{over the life of the}} contract.|$|E
5|$|Kouao and Climbié {{left the}} Ivory Coast {{possibly}} in November 1998 and flew to Paris, France, where Climbié enrolled at school. By December 1998, however, Kouao began to receive warnings about Climbié's absenteeism, and in February 1999, the school issued a child-at-risk notification {{and a social}} worker became involved. The school observed how Climbié tended to fall asleep in class, and the headteacher later recalled Kouao's mentioning Climbié suffering from some form of dermatological condition and that, on her last visit to the school on 25 March 1999, Climbié had a shaven head and was wearing a wig. When they left France, Kouao owed the authorities £2,000, after being wrongly paid in child benefit, and it is claimed that Kouao viewed Climbié as {{a useful tool for}} claiming benefits. Kouao had also been evicted from her home in France because <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> arrears.|$|E

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>rents</b> has {{a venerable}} history in {{economic}} theory. In his fundamental {{work on the}} Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith defined the concept {{making it clear that}} rents were distinct from profits. Ricardo, building on the foundation laid by Adam Smith, similarly distinguished between profits and rents in his theory about land <b>rents.</b> In spite <b>of</b> this, in fisheries economics the word rents is often carelessly used as synonymous with profits. To further confound the issue, some authors refer to this concept <b>of</b> <b>rents</b> as resource rents apparently suggested that the fisheries profits are somehow generated by the resource. This paper attempts to clarify these issues. It provides a definition <b>of</b> <b>rents</b> which makes theoretical sense and is in accordance with the traditional use of the term in economic theory. It then shows that there is no particular quantitative relation between rents and profits; rents may be larger, smaller or equal to profits. It further argues that while the the resource has an impact on the size <b>of</b> <b>rents,</b> many other factors also affect rents and there is no theoretical or quantitative basis for attributing part or the whole <b>of</b> <b>rents</b> to the resource...|$|R

40|$|This paper numerically {{investigates the}} {{significance}} <b>of</b> <b>rents</b> {{for both the}} welfare costs and the optimal design of commodity taxes using a general-equilibrium model calibrated to 1986 Canadian data. In the data we use, Ricardian rents are concentrated in agriculture and utilities, with market structure rents concentrated in manufacturing. Different types <b>of</b> <b>rents</b> have different implications for the welfare cost of taxes, and hence also for appropriate tax design. Ricardian rents lower the cost <b>of</b> taxes; <b>rents</b> supported by imperfect competition (with no free entry) raise the cost <b>of</b> taxes; <b>rents</b> supported by regulation generate rent-seeking costs, and if taxed improve resource allocation. Model results show a markedly nonuniform optimal tax structure, and a substantial influence of the treatment <b>of</b> <b>rents</b> on the pattern of optimal tax rates by commodity. © 1998 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|R

6000|$|But though {{cultivation}} {{cannot be}} extended, and the produce {{of the country}} increased, but {{in such a state}} of things as would allow of a rise <b>of</b> <b>rents,</b> yet it is of importance to remark, that this rise <b>of</b> <b>rents</b> will be by no means in proportion to the extension of cultivation, or the increase of produce.
