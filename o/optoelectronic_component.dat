5000|$|The {{charge-coupled}} device (CCD) is the image-capturing <b>optoelectronic</b> <b>component</b> in first-generation digital cameras. It {{was invented in}} 1969 by Willard Boyle and George E. Smith at AT&T Bell Labs as a memory device. The lab {{was working on the}} Picturephone and on the development of semiconductor bubble memory. Merging these two initiatives, Boyle and Smith conceived of the design of what they termed [...] "Charge 'Bubble' Devices". The essence of the design was the ability to transfer charge along the surface of a semiconductor. It was Dr. Michael Tompsett from Bell Labs however, who discovered that the CCD could be used as an imaging sensor. The CCD has increasingly been replaced by the active pixel sensor (APS), commonly used in cell phone cameras. These mobile phone cameras are used by billions of people worldwide, dramatically increasing photographic activity and material and also fueling citizen journalism.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of the impact of manufacturing offshore on technology competitiveness in the optoelectronics industry. It examines a critical design/facility location decision being faced by <b>optoelectronic</b> <b>component</b> manufacturers. This paper uses a combination of simulation modeling and empirical data to demonstrate the economic constraints facing these firms. The results show that production location changes the relative production economics of the two competing designs [...] one emerging, one prevailing [...] that are currently perfect substitutes for each other on the telecom market, but not necessarily perfect substitutes in other markets in the long term. Specifically, if <b>optoelectronic</b> <b>component</b> firms shift production from the United States to countries in developing East Asia, the emerging designs that were developed in the United States no longer pay. Production characteristics are different abroad, and the prevailing design can be more cost effective in developing country production environments. The emerging designs, however, have performance characteristics that may be valuable in the long term to the larger computing market and to pushing forward Moore's law.

We explore in particular whether (1) due to different offshore production economics, firms who move manufacturing offshore slow U. S. -based R 2 ̆ 6 D activities in an emerging technology and (2) the inventors originally within these offshoring firms, leave, and continue innovating in the emerging technology at different institutions. We focus on the 28 leading U. S. <b>optoelectronic</b> <b>component</b> manufactures for telecommunications and the inventors who patent at these firms. We triangulate hand-classified USPTO patents, SEC filings, inventor resumes, survey data, and select interviews of key inventors. We find that, in the case of U.

While the majority of inventors depart to firms outside the industry and stop work in the emerging technology, an important minority of emerging technology inventors at the offshoring firms depart to a single onshore firm in the same industry (which gains from others’ losses and subsequently dominates this space).
