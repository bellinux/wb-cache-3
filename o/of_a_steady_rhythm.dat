5000|$|... "Every Breath You Take," [...] {{which begins}} side {{two of the}} record, is {{possibly}} The Police's best-known song, with Sting's vocals on top <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm</b> featuring picked guitar, strong bass, and controlled drumming. Originally, the song was what Summers called a [...] "Hammond organ thing that sounded like Billy Preston." [...] The guitarist {{came up with a}} more interesting guitar riff which became a distinctive part of the piece. The song, released before the album, went to number 1 on both the US and UK charts, aided by a black and white video directed by Godley & Creme.|$|E
40|$|Wearable technologies, in {{the form}} of small, light and {{inconspicuous}} devices, can be designed to help individuals suffering from neurological conditions carry out regular rehabilitation exercises. Current research has shown that walking to a rhythm can lead to significant improvements in various aspects of gait. Our primary aim is to provide a suitable, technology based intervention to enhance gait rehabilitation of people with chronic and degenerative neurological health conditions (such as stroke). This intervention will be {{in the form}} of small, lightweight, wireless, wearable devices the user can take out of the clinic, extending their rehabilitation to their own home setting. The devices can deliver <b>a</b> series <b>of</b> vibrations at <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm</b> giving the patient a more stable and symmetric pace of walking. The simplest version of this approach typically comprise <b>of</b> <b>a</b> very small network of just two nodes and a central controller. The existing prototypes (called the Haptic Bracelets) capture and analyse motion data in real time to provide adaptive haptic (through vibrations) cueing. In the future and after more refinement, the system could allow a single therapist to monitor and advise groups of stroke survivors undergoing therapy sessions...|$|R
5000|$|Beharrungstendenz: <b>a</b> {{tendency}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> oscillator {{to maintain}} <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm.</b> This would include movements such as breathing, chewing and running, which Holst called states of absolute coordination.|$|R

50|$|Spitz’s musical {{style is}} {{influenced}} by Donovan, using electric guitar played with arpeggio, and <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm.</b> Their simple melodies are influenced by popular songs and use Kusano’s soft voice.|$|R
50|$|In the ball-room the gavotte {{was often}} {{paired with a}} {{preceding}} triple-time minuet: both dances are stately, and the gavotte's lifted step contrasted with the shuffling minuet step. It had <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm,</b> not broken up into faster notes.|$|R
50|$|The call of {{the tiny}} hawk is a shrill, high-pitched, {{somewhat}} quavery series of 20 - 30 notes of uneven pitch. After an initial few accelerating notes, the call settles into <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm,</b> variously transcribed as caucau-ca-ca-ca, keer-keer-keer or kree-ree-ree-ree.|$|R
5000|$|The steamed rice is mashed {{and pounded}} with wooden mallets (kine) in a {{traditional}} mortar (usu). The work involves two people, one pounding and the other turning and wetting the substance [...] the mochi. They must keep <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm</b> or they may accidentally injure each other with the heavy kine.|$|R
50|$|Children {{with autism}} are also prone to more bouts of anxiety {{than the average}} child. Short {{sessions}} (15-20 minutes) of listening to percussive music or classical music with <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm</b> {{have been shown to}} alleviate symptoms of anxiety and temporarily decrease anxiety-related behaviour. Music with <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> 4/4 beat is thought to work best due to the predictability of the beat.|$|R
5000|$|Author John Stevens, in his book, The Marathon Monks of Mount Hiei, {{describes}} the long distance walking style which dates back {{over a thousand}} years: [...] "Eyes focused about 100 feet ahead while moving in <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm,</b> keeping the head level, the shoulders relaxed, the back straight, and the nose aligned with the navel." ...|$|R

5000|$|In some genres, such as folk or country, {{the player}} can [...] "lock in" [...] to a picking pattern {{for the whole}} song, or even the whole performance, since these forms of music are based on {{maintaining}} <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm.</b> [...] However, in other genres—such as classical, flamenco or fingerstyle jazz—it becomes necessary to switch fluently between patterns.|$|R
25|$|The next {{improvement}} was the Baudot code of 1874. French engineer Émile Baudot patented a printing telegraph {{in which the}} signals were translated automatically into typographic characters. Each character was assigned a unique code based on the sequence of just five contacts. Operators had to maintain <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm,</b> and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.|$|R
5000|$|... "Peace" [...] {{provides}} {{the first time}} is the track when Max Roach plays <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm</b> behind Lincoln, whose vocal part transitions from scatting into a guttural tone and finishes with an exhaustive exhale. [...] "It this is Peace, it is peace with gothic undertones, as if ghosts of the past might be appeased for a moment but never exorcised in their entirety." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>As</b> <b>an</b> example <b>of</b> {{deterministic}} compositions through mathematical models, the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences {{provides an}} option to play an integer sequence as 12-tone equal temperament music. (It is initially set to convert each integer to a note on an 88-key musical keyboard by computing the integer modulo 88, at <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm.</b> Thus 123456, the natural numbers, equals half <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chromatic scale.) ...|$|R
500|$|Umpire Ronnie Howard said [...] "It was a {{damaging}} race, and I {{was looking}} for possible breakages". [...] Oxford's stroke Richard Thorp explained [...] "We expect it [...] but Ali [...] has so much more experience of the Tideway".

50|$|The {{horse is}} usually ridden on {{contact with the}} rein, and the horse is penalized if it must be ridden on strong contact, gapes its mouth, does not respond willingly to light aids, or does not travel in balance. The horse should move straight, with <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm</b> and <b>a</b> free and flowing stride. The horse should not come behind the bit, or travel too fast.|$|R

5000|$|True Master's [...] "Y'all Been Warned" [...] is {{a simple}} one-bar {{composition}} with a funky guitar riff over <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm</b> and <b>a</b> deeply buried piano sample. The advance copy of Iron Flag featured a slightly different version of this song which featured a synthesizer line {{over the top of}} the guitar riff. It is not known why this was changed for the final release.|$|R
50|$|An {{individual}} with this condition has an especially difficult time maintaining <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> beat, and even has difficulty following along to <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm.</b> Before {{it was a}} known disorder, {{it was thought that}} these individuals were just severely uncoordinated, and therefore were unable to follow along with the music. It has been discovered recently that problems with rhythm in Schizophrenia, Parkinson's, and Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder are also found to have a correlation to rhythm deficiencies.|$|R
50|$|Carman's musical {{abilities}} {{were rather}} limited, consisting of simple single-note runs repeated with little {{attention given to}} <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm</b> or conventional time keeping. Carman's sloppiness was made worse by his heavy drinking and he often {{did not bother to}} tune his guitar. His singing voice was similarly ragged, having a nasal twang and limited range. In spite of his musical limitations Carman remained popular with audiences due to his distinctive sound, easy going charm and humor.|$|R
50|$|The mower {{swings the}} scythe {{steadily}} in long, left handed arcs ending {{in front of}} the mower and depositing the cut grass neatly to the left. The mower takes a small step forward and repeats the motion, proceeding with <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm,</b> stopping at frequent intervals to hone the blade. The correct technique has a slicing action on the grass, cutting a narrow strip, leaving a uniform stubble on the ground and forming a regular windrow on the left.|$|R
60|$|The {{congregation}} {{faced the}} heat with informality. Men with highly plastered hair, so painfully shaved that their faces looked sore, removed their coats, sighed, and unbuttoned two buttons of their uncreased Sunday vests. Large-bosomed, white-bloused, hot-necked, spectacled matrons--the Mothers in Israel, pioneers {{and friends of}} Mrs. Champ Perry--waved their palm-leaf fans in <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm.</b> Abashed boys slunk into the rear pews and giggled, while milky little girls, up front with their mothers, self-consciously kept from turning around.|$|R
50|$|This {{composition}} {{is in one}} movement and takes three minutes to perform. It is scored for a normal SATB mixed choir, but it requires SAATBB in some segments. The text is extracted from a traditional Hungarian ballad by Sándor Weöres, and has been translated into English by collaborator Desmond Clayton. The composition has <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm,</b> marked Andante moderato (♩ = 88), and only changes its tempo towards the end, to a Meno mosso (♩ = 68) (Andante poco sostenuto).|$|R
500|$|Despite this, fatigue {{began to}} set in to the Oxford crew and Cambridge came back into contention. [...] With <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm,</b> the Light Blues were level at the Bathing Place of Athens and held a clear water {{advantage}} by The Bull's Head pub. [...] A length ahead by Barnes Bridge, Cambridge pulled further ahead to win by three-and-a-half lengths in <b>a</b> time <b>of</b> 22 minutes 35 seconds. [...] It was Cambridge's fifth consecutive victory and took the overall record to 1615 in favour of Oxford.|$|R
40|$|What sensory feedback, tactile or auditory, is {{the more}} {{important}} for a musician when playing? In an attempt to answer this question, {{subjects were asked to}} play along with a metronome while the auditory feedback from their playing was manipulated. The preliminary results showed a tendency for matching sound with sound, i. e. players initiated strokes earlier as the delay increased. Increase in timing errors indicate a possible breakpoint around 55 ms. As the feedback was delayed even more subjects showed increased difficulties in maintaining <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm.</b> 1...|$|R
50|$|Bilateral {{sound is}} <b>a</b> type <b>of</b> {{bilateral}} stimulation used in eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) {{in the same}} manner as eye movement. It has been reported to enhance visualization and hypnosis, but this has received little attention in research. Essentially, the sound moves back and forth across the stereo field at <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm.</b> In this regard, bilateral sound has been used in commercial recordings, and has been applied manually with the use <b>of</b> <b>an</b> electronic metronome or other means. Controversies regarding this and other forms of bilateral stimulation are discussed in the article on EMDR.|$|R
5000|$|The third {{movement}} {{tries to}} resemble [...] "the atmosphere <b>of</b> <b>a</b> massive nightclub with people dancing and taking drugs". It has <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm</b> {{which has been}} compared to Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring. The music here is much more insistent than in the previous movements and is much more vivid and lively. After reaching a climax echoed by the strings, the fourth movement becomes calmer at the beginning, and suddenly turns violent when a tutti chord initiated by the horns bursts {{towards the end of the}} piece. Asyla ends in a quiet but trembling manner.|$|R
5000|$|The piece shown above, the Prelude no. 1 in C major [...] (BWV 846) from J. S. Bachs Well-Tempered Clavier, {{illustrates}} <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> harmonic <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> one chord change per measure, {{although the}} melodic rhythm is much faster.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1983 inaugural World Athletics Championships, he {{was among}} the favourites to win the 5,000-metre title, but for some reasonhe could not {{accelerate}} enough when it mattered the most - during the final lap - despite running at <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm</b> earlier in the race. Accordingly, he dropped from third to sixth during the last lap, and lost to the winner, Ireland's Eamonn Coghlan, by almost four seconds (see, for example, [...] "World Athletics Championships 1983" [...] / Yleisurheilun MM-kisat 1983, written by the [...] "Runner" [...] / Juoksija magazine's journalists and published in Finland in 1983).|$|R
50|$|The main {{sections}} of the system were constructed between 1744 and 1752, under the patronage of Archbishop D. José de Bragança (1741-1756), although {{it is known that}} his predecessor D. Rodrigo de Moura Telles (1704-1728) already completed portions of the network: first deposit dates to 1752. D. José became interested in this issue immediately after arrive in Braga, starting in August 1741, and continuing at <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm</b> until 1744. For his part, D. Rodrigo de Moura Telles supplied water to the Hospital of São Marcos and substituted this fountain with another (the Fountain of Castelos).|$|R
5000|$|Music website AllMusic awarded Volume 1: Instrumental Driving Music for Felons {{three out}} of five stars. In <b>a</b> four-star review <b>of</b> Volumes 1 & 2 for the website, Tom Schulte said the {{following}} about the albums: [...] "Propelled by <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm</b> section, guitars or keyboards creep in to contribute mostly spectral wails decaying with tremolo or reverb. The picture you get is very much that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> desert, a wasteland divided by <b>a</b> stark streak <b>of</b> asphalt." [...] He summarised the album as a [...] "soundtrack for a running reckless in a land where the only visible things are the dash panel, the headlights, and the stars".|$|R
500|$|On Monday, November 28, 1887, Gray's {{hand and}} arm became paralyzed {{while he was}} coming down the stairs for breakfast. Even though the {{paralysis}} worsened, {{he was able to}} address two letters. On Thursday he lost the ability to speak in <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm.</b> He lay speechless and quiet for two months, and died on January30, 1888. He was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery. He did not want anything fancy on his gravestone, so his wife had it engraved with a cross and [...] "Asa Gray 1810–1888".

2500|$|Education and {{training}} {{can be obtained}} through certificate or diploma programs, distance learning, and/or on-the-job training offered in some hospitals, although there are countries currently employing transcriptionists that require 18 months to 2 years of specialized MT training. Working in medical transcription leads to a mastery in medical terminology and editing, ability to listen and type simultaneously, utilization of playback controls on the transcriber (machine), and use of foot [...] to play and adjust dictations – all while maintaining <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> execution. Medical transcription training normally includes coursework in medical terminology, anatomy, editing, grammar and punctuation, typing, medical record types and formats, and healthcare documentation.|$|R
