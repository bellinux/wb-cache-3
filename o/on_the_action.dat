5|$|Drowned God uses a point-and-click {{interface}} {{and first}} person perspective typical of games similar to Myst of the mid- to late-1990s. The player navigates and {{interacts with the}} game world by clicking the mouse on {{different parts of the}} screen. The mouse cursor changes shape depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> clicking will perform: an arrow for moving to another location, a face with an arrow to pick up or place Tarot cards, and an Eye of Providence for activating or interacting with objects in the environment. Frequent cutscenes provide background information and advance the storyline.|$|E
5|$|In Giants: Citizen Kabuto, players take on {{the roles}} of three {{humanoid}} races: gun-toting Meccaryns, magic-wielding Sea Reapers, and the gigantic Kabuto. Each player is assigned direct control of a single character. The game's developers, Planet Moon Studios, created this design to encourage players to focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> {{and not to be}} burdened with micromanagement. Players can customize the controls, which are largely the same for each race, with slight differences for abilities.|$|E

5|$|The concept {{work for}} Muramasa began {{during the middle}} of {{development}} on Odin Sphere. Along with improving <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> gameplay over Odin Sphere, a great deal of effort was put into making the game's setting authentic to the period. Kamitani created the story based on kabuki theatre, incorporating Japanese folklore and Buddhist theology. When the game released in the West, it retained its Japanese voicetrack to preserve its atmosphere. It released to moderate sales and positive reviews. The Vita port, released in the West as Muramasa Rebirth, released to strong sales and similar reception to its original version.|$|E
5|$|Two mini-series {{were also}} produced. The first, G.I. Joe: Order of Battle, was a 4-issue mini-series running from December 1986 to March 1987, reprinting the data found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> figures' file cards with some edits. Written by Hama, with all-new artwork by Trimpe, {{the first two}} issues {{featured}} G.I. Joe members, while the third issue focused on the members of Cobra Command, and the fourth highlighted the vehicles and equipment used by both organizations. A trade-paperback edition, which included material from all four issues, was published in 1987.|$|E

5|$|Dungeon Siege was {{the first}} title by Gas Powered Games, which was founded by in May 1998 by Chris Taylor, then known for the 1997 {{real-time}} strategy game Total Annihilation. Joined by several of his coworkers from Cavedog Entertainment, Taylor {{wanted to create a}} different type of game, and after trying several concepts they decided to make an action role-playing game as their first title. Taylor also served as one of the designers for the game, joined by Jacob McMahon as the other lead designer and producer and Neal Hallford as the lead story and dialogue writer. The music was composed by Jeremy Soule, who had also worked on Total Annihilation. Gas Powered Games concentrated on making a role-playing game that was stripped of the typical genre elements they found slow or frustrating, to keep the player focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>action.</b> Development took over four years, though it was initially planned to take only two; completing the game within even four years required the team to work 12- to 14-hour days and weekends for most of the time.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix {{was joined}} {{soon after the}} {{surrender}} of Argo by the 74gun ship of the line HMS Powerful under Captain William O'Bryen Drury and together the ships took possession of the frigate while the chase of {{the remainder of the}} Batavian squadron continued. At 10:00 two of the brigs turned towards the Batavian coastline to seek shelter and two of the leading British ships, Pegasus and the 50gun HMS Leander under Captain Maurice Delgarno, turned in chase. Donnelly sought to interpose his ships between the brigs and the coast, but found that this would have slowed his vessels so much that the Batavian brigs would have an opportunity to escape. He therefore maintained pursuit and watched the Batavian ships, Gier and Echo driven ashore at the Batavian village of Bosch. Sailing as close to the shore line as safely possible, Delgarno detached cutters to investigate the state of the grounded ships, determining that one had been damaged beyond repair while the other, having initially grounded, had been driven over the shoal into deeper water on the far side. In his report <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>action,</b> Duncan considered that a storm which swept the area on the day following the action probably drove the brig back onto the shoal and destroyed it.|$|E
5|$|Warren Davis, a {{programmer}} hired to work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> game Protector, noticed Lee's ideas, {{and asked if}} he could use them to practice programming randomness and gravity as game mechanic. Thus, he added balls that bounced from the pyramid's top to bottom. Because Davis was still learning how to program game mechanics, he wanted to keep the design simple. He also felt games with complex control schemes were frustrating and wanted something that could be played with one hand. To accomplish this, Davis removed the shooting and changed the objective to saving the protagonist from danger. As Davis worked on the game one night, Gottlieb's vice president of engineering, Ron Waxman, noticed him and suggested to change the color of the cubes after the game's character has landed on them. Davis implemented a unique control scheme; a four-way joystick was rotated 45° to match the directions of Q*bert's jumping. Staff members at Gottlieb urged for a more conventional orientation, but Davis stuck to his decision. Davis remembered to have started programming in April 1982, but the project was only put on schedule as an actual product several months later.|$|E

25|$|The Wnt {{signaling}} pathways are complex, involving {{many different}} elements, and therefore have many targets for misregulation.
