40|$|Futures {{exchanges and}} <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> assume {{counterparty}} risks and demand in return guarantees that these counterparties will deliver on their promises. It is often argued that to attract volume, <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> would settle for excessively low contractual guarantees. In Tano Santos and José Scheinkman (2001) we model financial intermediation {{in an environment}} where traders may choose to default, and we examine the characteristics of the equilibrium. In particular, we investigate whether competition implies excessively low standards. We show that in fact, when society punishes default and intermediaries can impose collateral requirements to effectively limit the size of positions, competition leads to a (constrained) optimal amount of contractual guarantees. In Santos and Scheinkman (2001) we assume that exchanges cannot control the size of the positions taken by individuals, but we preclude investors from participating in more than one exchange. This ignores the effect that trading with one <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> may have on the risks faced by <b>other</b> <b>intermediaries.</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> typically cannot control the amount of risk that counterparties will take with other intermediaries. In this paper we examine the effect of dropping this exclusivity assumption. We show that the constrained optimum can no longer be implemented as a standard Nash equilibrium with free entry. Nonetheless this allocation {{is the only one that}} can be sustained as an anticipatory equilibrium (Charles Wilson (1977)). To break a candidate anticipator...|$|R

Near the steady state, these intermediaries can raise equity finance at no cost through retained earnings. However, even moderately large shocks cause their borrowing constraints to bind, leading to contractions in credit offered to firms, and requiring the intermediaries to raise further funds by paying the cost to issue equity. This leads to the occasional sharp increases in interest spreads and the counter-cyclical, positively skewed equity issuance that are characteristic of the credit crunches observed in the data...|$|R

Studies that do not address endogeneity tend to overstate the effect of finance on growth. The effect seems to be weaker in poor countries, but it decreases worldwide after the 1980 s.

40|$|Diversity across {{banks and}} <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> firms {{promotes}} a resilient financial system because differing risk profiles {{reduce the likelihood}} of systemic crises caused by shared economic shocks. Consolidation and uniformity among banks and <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> do the opposite.; Yet some have suggested that any policy steps to reverse the financial system’s dramatic consolidation might yield little stability benefit because herd-like behavior among financial firms could still reduce diversity and mitigate any strengthening. If these firms moved in concert, the argument goes, they would make themselves susceptible to common shocks as if they had adopted a more consolidated structure.; Countering this concern are indications that financial firms, when allowed to flourish, display stability-enhancing diversity. We find that hedge funds—despite a reputation for high-risk strategies and correlated behavior—recently have exhibited significant strategic dissimilarities, to the benefit of system stability.

40|$|This article {{studies the}} {{differences}} between traditional <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> (commercial banks, savings banks and cooperative banks) and ethical banks based on property rights, in which the owner decides the ideology, principles, standards and objectives of the organisation.

This is the Radical Affinity Index (RAI), which groups banks together in terms of their stance on ethical commitment, concentrating on ethical ideology and principles (information transparency, placement of assets, guarantees and participation) and using a sample of 114 European banks. The evidence shows that transparency of information and placement of assets are factors that differentiate ethical banks from <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries.</b> Guarantees and participation are characteristics specific to ethical banks; these variables, however, do not offer clear evidence to our analysis...|$|R

This network financing model is based on Web 2.0 technology. Its core is a lending web site, which is a platform between borrowers and lenders.

40|$|Given the {{frequent}} assertion that commissions paid to brokers and <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> lead to unsuitable advice, it is puzzling that {{this practice is}} pervasive. We offer two rationales for why advice may be compensated indirectly through (disclosed or undisclosed) commissions or other payments made by product providers, rather than directly through a flat fee paid by the customer. Indirect compensation may allow product providers and their agents to maximally exploit customers who are naive about the true conflict of interest at the advice stage. Commissions also arise under efficient contracting with wary customers, even though advice will then be biased. Policy intervention that is directed towards making customers pay directly for advice would thus be bene…cial for channels populated (or for products purchased) mainly by naive customers, {{but it may be}} counterproductive otherwise...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{clear evidence}} that the yield spread between long-term taxable and tax-exempt bonds responds to changes in expected individual tax rates, a finding that refutes theories of municipal bond pricing that focus exclusively on commercial banks or <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries.</b> The results support the conclusion that in the two decades prior to 1986, the municipal bond market was segmented, with different investor clienteles at short and long maturities. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 is likely to affect this market, however, since it has restricted tax benefits from tax-exempt bond investment by commercial banks. Individual investors are increasingly important suppliers of capital to states and localities, and their tax rates {{are likely to be}} the primary determinant of the yield spread between taxable and tax-exempt interest rates in the future. ...|$|R

Moreover, I show that the problem gets worse with increased integration and puts an endogenous limit on the amount of value-enhancing redistribution that can be achieved in an integrated firm. I then argue that the control rights that come with asset ownership enable a firm to set “the rules of the game ” and mitigate negative managerial behavior through organizational processes such as rigid capital budgets, job rotation, centralization and hierarchies. These results point to a comparative advantage that a firm has over <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> in allocating resources...|$|R
