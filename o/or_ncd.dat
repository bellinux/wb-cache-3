40|$|International audienceAutophagic or {{necrotic}} {{cell death}} (ACD and NCD, respectively), {{studied in the}} model organism Dictyostelium which offers unique advantages, require triggering by the same differentiation-inducing factor DIF- 1. To initiate {{these two types of}} cell death, does DIF- 1 act through only one or through two distinct recognition structures? Such distinct structures may recognize distinct motifs of DIF- 1. To test this albeit indirectly, DIF- 1 was modified at one or two of several positions, and the corresponding derivatives were tested for their abilities to induce ACD <b>or</b> <b>NCD.</b> The results strongly indicated that distinct biochemical motifs of DIF- 1 were required to trigger ACD <b>or</b> <b>NCD,</b> and that these motifs were separately recognized at the onset of ACD <b>or</b> <b>NCD.</b> In addition, both ACD and NCD were induced more efficiently by DIF- 1 than by either its precursors or its immediate catabolite. These results showed an unexpected relation between a differentiation factor, the cellular structures that recognize it, the cell death types it can trigger and the metabolic state of the cell. The latter seems to guide the choice of the signaling pathway to cell death, which in turn imposes the cell death type and the recognition pattern of the differentiation factor...|$|E

We derive various lower bounds of NCD and propose pruning policies to further reduce computational complexity. We evaluate SigNCD on both English and Chinese datasets and show an increase in F 1 score compared with the original NCD method and a significant reduction in runtime.

In this article we investigate the benefit of DFP for speaker identification. Previous applications of DFP to speaker recognition have not clearly separated the performance advantages due to DFP and MCT, or demonstrated clearly improved performance except for DFP, MCT and MSC in combination. In this article we investigate the application of DFP and MCT to noise robust speaker identification, both alone and in combination. We also compare these to two stage processing in which noise condition detection (NCD) permits the subsequent use of noise matched models. We show that DFP by multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) can indeed improve incremental-set speaker identification on its own, provided that a suitable MLP is trained with data from a sufficient number of different speakers. Further improvements are then obtained by combining DFP with MCT <b>or</b> <b>NCD.</b> As previously, the MLP is trained to recognise a closed (i. e. fixed) set of speakers, but it is not used as a classifier.

OBJECTIVE: PaCO 2 affects cerebral blood flow (CBF) and its regulatory mechanisms, but the effects of CO 2 measurement technique on cerebrovascular parameters are unknown. In order to determine if the two most commonly used approaches, face mask (FM) <b>or</b> nasal cannulae (<b>NC),</b> are interchangeable <b>or</b> not, we tested the hypothesis that the use of FM versus NC does not lead to significant differences in CO 2 -related systemic and cerebrovascular parameters. APPROACH: Recordings of CBF velocity (CBFV), blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and end-tidal CO 2 (EtCO 2) were performed in 42 subjects during normocapnia (FM <b>or</b> <b>NC)</b> and 5 % CO 2 inhalation (FM) <b>or</b> hyperventilation (<b>NC).</b> Dynamic cerebral autoregulation was assessed with the autoregulation index (ARI), derived by transfer function analysis from the CBFV response to a hypothetical step change in BP. MAIN RESULTS: Significant differences in physiological parameters were seen between FM and NC: EtCO 2 (37. 40 versus 35. 26 mmHg, p[*][*]=[*][*] 0. 001) and heart rate (69. 6 versus 66. 7 bpm, p[*][*]=[*][*] 0. 001) respectively.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} study, the long-duration {{frictional}} and wear {{performance of the}} MCD/DLC (Micro-crystalline Diamond / Diamond-like Carbon) bilayered film are investigated under water-lubricating conditions. All friction tests are carried out on a rotation “ball-on-plate ” tribotester where the MCD/DLC is slid against with a Φ 6. 0 mm Si 3 N 4 ball and the whole sliding contact is immersed in deionized water during the sliding process. A full factorial experimental plan is conducted with four sliding velocities ranging from 0. 126 to 0. 503 m/s and four normal loads from 2 to 8 N. The duration of each sliding process is 24 h. For the sake of comparability, conventional MCD and NCD (Nano-crystalline Diamond) films are also adopted under each sliding condition. The {{results show that the}} stable coefficient of friction (COF) of MCD/DLC film is ranging from 0. 025 to 0. 12 under the water-lubricating condition, comparable with the NCD film but much lower than that of single-layered MCD film; in contrast, the top-layered DLC film does not show beneficial effect on enhancing the sliding stability of single-layered diamond films. Moreover, its specific wear rate is estimated at the level of 10 - 8 mm 3 N- 1 m- 1, higher than that of MCD <b>or</b> <b>NCD</b> films. The sliding interface is under boundary lubrication condition, high normal load causes more prominent mechanical interactions between two contacted surfaces and thus produces a smoother and cleaner equilibrium sliding interface, which finally results in the decreasing tendency of stable COF as the load rises.

Aim: To compile a profile of treatment-seeking obese patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) <b>or</b> <b>NCD</b> risk factors and to compare patients who choose group-based (facility-based therapeutic group [FBTG]) versus usual care (individual consultations) treatment. Setting: A primary healthcare facility in Cape Town, South Africa. Methods: One hundred and ninety-three patients were recruited in this cross-sectional study. Ninety six chose FBTG while 97 chose usual care. A questionnaire, the hospital database and patients’ folders were used to collect data. Weight, height and waist circumference were measured. STATA 11. 0 was used for descriptive statistics and to compare the two groups. Results: The subjects’ mean age was 50. 4 years, 78 % were women and of low education levels and income, and 41. 5 % had type 2 diabetes, 83. 4 % hypertension and 69. 5 % high cholesterol. Mean (s. d.) HbA 1 c was 9. 1 (2. 0) %, systolic BP 145. 6 (21. 0) mmHg, diastolic BP 84. 5 (12. 0) mmHg, cholesterol 5. 4 (1. 2) mmol/L), body mass indicator (BMI) 39. 3 (7. 3) kg/m 2 and waist circumference 117 (12. 6) cm). These figures were undesirable although pharmacological treatment for diabetes and hypertension was in place. Only 14 % were physically active, while TV viewing was > 2 h/day. Mean daily intake of fruit and vegetables (2. 2 portions/day) was low while added sugar (5 teaspoons) and sugar-sweetened beverages (1. 3 glasses) were high. Usual care patients had a higher smoking prevalence, HbA 1 c, number of NCD risk factors and refined carbohydrate intake, and a lower fruit and vegetable intake. Conclusion: Treatment seekers were typically middle-aged, low income women with various modifiable and intermediate risk factors for NCDs. Patients choosing usual care could have more NCD risks.

40|$|Abstract Background Similarity of {{sequences}} {{is a key}} mathematical notion for Classification and Phylogenetic {{studies in}} Biology. It is currently primarily handled using alignments. However, the alignment methods seem inadequate for post-genomic studies since they do not scale well with data set size {{and they seem to}} be confined only to genomic and proteomic sequences. Therefore, alignment-free similarity measures are actively pursued. Among those, USM (Universal Similarity Metric) has gained prominence. It is based on the deep theory of Kolmogorov Complexity and universality is its most novel striking feature. Since it can only be approximated via data compression, USM is a methodology rather than a formula quantifying the similarity of two strings. Three approximations of USM are available, namely UCD (Universal Compression Dissimilarity), NCD (Normalized Compression Dissimilarity) and CD (Compression Dissimilarity). Their applicability and robustness is tested on various data sets yielding a first massive quantitative estimate that the USM methodology and its approximations are of value. Despite the rich theory developed around USM, its experimental assessment has limitations: only a few data compressors have been tested in conjunction with USM and mostly at a qualitative level, no comparison among UCD, NCD and CD is available and no comparison of USM with existing methods, both based on alignments and not, seems to be available. Results We experimentally test the USM methodology by using 25 compressors, all three of its known approximations and six data sets of relevance to Molecular Biology. This offers the first systematic and quantitative experimental assessment of this methodology, that naturally complements the many theoretical and the preliminary experimental results available. Moreover, we compare the USM methodology both with methods based on alignments and not. We may group our experiments into two sets. The first one, performed via ROC (Receiver Operating Curve) analysis, aims at assessing the intrinsic ability of the methodology to discriminate and classify biological sequences and structures. A second set of experiments aims at assessing how well two commonly available classification algorithms, UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) and NJ (Neighbor Joining), can use the methodology to perform their task, their performance being evaluated against gold standards and with the use of well known statistical indexes, i. e., the F-measure and the partition distance. Based on the experiments, several conclusions can be drawn and, from them, novel valuable guidelines for the use of USM on biological data. The main ones are reported next. Conclusion UCD and NCD are indistinguishable, i. e., they yield nearly the same values of the statistical indexes we have used, accross experiments and data sets, while CD is almost always worse than both. UPGMA seems to yield better classification results with respect to NJ, i. e., better values of the statistical indexes (10 % difference or above), on a substantial fraction of experiments, compressors and USM approximation choices. The compression program PPMd, based on PPM (Prediction by Partial Matching), for generic data and Gencompress for DNA, are the best performers among the compression algorithms we have used, although the difference in performance, as measured by statistical indexes, between them and the other algorithms depends critically on the data set and may not be as large as expected. PPMd used with UCD <b>or</b> <b>NCD</b> and UPGMA, on sequence data is very close, although worse, in performance with the alignment methods (less than 2 % difference on the F-measure). Yet, it scales well with data set size and it can work on data other than sequences. In summary, our quantitative analysis naturally complements the rich theory behind USM and supports the conclusion that the methodology is worth using because of its robustness, flexibility, scalability, and competitiveness with existing techniques. In particular, the methodology applies to all biological data in textual format. The software and data sets are available under the GNU GPL at the supplementary material web page. </p...|$|E
