The economies of China, India and other emerging countries slowed in 2014 and 2015. In 2014 alone, 23,722,890 motor vehicles were produced in China, excluding motorbikes.

30|$|Various {{researchers}} {{have investigated the}} relationship between <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> <b>and</b> inflation in Turkey.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{evaluate}} the effect of crude <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> on global fertilizer prices in both the mean and volatility. The endogenous structural breakpoint unit root test, the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model, and alternative volatility models, including the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model, Exponential GARCH (EGARCH) model, and GJR model, are used to investigate the relationship between crude <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> <b>and</b> six global fertilizer prices. Weekly data for 2003 - 2008 for the seven price series are analyzed. The empirical results from ARDL show that most fertilizer prices are significantly affected by the crude <b>oil</b> <b>price,</b> which explains why global fertilizer prices reached a peak in 2008. We also find that that the volatility of global fertilizer <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> crude <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> from March to December 2008 are higher than in other periods, and that the peak crude <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> caused greater volatility in the crude <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> <b>and</b> global fertilizer <b>prices.</b> As volatility invokes financial risk, the relationship between <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> <b>and</b> global fertilizer <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> their associated volatility is important for public polic...|$|R

5|$|The {{formation}} of OPEC marked {{a turning point}} toward national sovereignty over natural resources, and OPEC decisions have come to play {{a prominent role in}} the global oil market and international relations. The effect can be particularly strong when wars or civil disorders lead to extended interruptions in supply. In the 1970s, restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> OPEC's revenue and wealth, with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the global economy. In the 1980s, OPEC started setting production targets for its member nations; and generally when the production targets are reduced, oil prices increase, most recently from the organization's 2008 and 2016 decisions to trim oversupply.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest postâ€“World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring <b>oil</b> <b>prices,</b> <b>and</b> a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E
5|$|In October 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC, {{consisting}} of the Arab majority of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria) declared significant production cuts and an oil embargo against the United States and other industrialized nations that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War. A previous embargo attempt was largely ineffective {{in response to the}} Six-Day War in 1967. However, in 1973, the result was a sharp rise in <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> OPEC revenues, from US$3/bbl to US$12/bbl, and an emergency period of energy rationing, intensified by panic reactions, a declining trend in US oil production, currency devaluations, and a lengthy UK coal-miners dispute. For a time, the UK imposed an emergency three-day workweek. Seven European nations banned non-essential Sunday driving. US gas stations limited the amount of gasoline that could be dispensed, closed on Sundays, and restricted the days when gasoline could be purchased, based on license plate numbers. Even after the embargo ended in March 1974 following intense diplomatic activity, prices continued to rise. The world experienced a global economic recession, with unemployment and inflation surging simultaneously, steep declines in stock and bond prices, major shifts in trade balances and petrodollar flows, and a dramatic end to the post-WWII economic boom.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} the oil price-industrial production nexus in Thailand by using multivariate cointegration test. In addition, Granger causality {{is also used}} to examine the impact of <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> uncertainty on industrial production growth. The main focus of this paper is on one sector of the economy, i. e., manufacturing sector. Monthly data from 1993 to 2015 are utilized. Empirical results reveal that there is a long-run relationship between industrial production <b>and</b> real <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> <b>and</b> other variables. Industrial production adjusts rapidly to shocks to lending rate, <b>price</b> level <b>and</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price.</b> Furthermore, there exists long-run causality running from lending rate, <b>price</b> level <b>and</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> to industrial production. However, industrial production growth does not respond to <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> shock <b>and</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> uncertainty. Asymmetric <b>and</b> nonlinear relationship between <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> shock <b>and</b> industrial output growth is not found. These findings give some policy implications. Keywords.
