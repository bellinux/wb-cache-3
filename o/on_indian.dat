5|$|An older Khan {{returns to}} Bombay to kill Rawal (Mahesh Manjrekar), who opposed his {{ambition}} {{to take the}} reins in Bombay. Although the city was his first love, rising starlet Jasmine (Sonakshi Sinha) wins his heart. Khan advances Jasmine's career by rigging awards, and showers her with gifts; he becomes obsessed with her. He sends Aslam and another trustworthy aide, Jimmy, to kill Rawal. Jimmy fails, accidentally killing his girlfriend, Mona, and flees. He is soon captured by the police, hot on Khan's trail after learning about his arrival in Bombay. Jimmy, loyal to Khan, does not crack during his interrogation and is freed {{due to lack of}} evidence. The police intend to draw Khan out from hiding; he has eluded them for twelve years, and this is their last chance to take him <b>on</b> <b>Indian</b> soil.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} thirty-eight, Metcalfe {{was elected}} to the Sixteenth Congress, {{defeating}} Joshua Desha. During his tenure in the House, which lasted five terms, he was the chairman of the Committee <b>on</b> <b>Indian</b> Affairs and the Committee on Militia. He opposed the Second Bank of the United States, but favored extension of credit to purchasers of public land. In 1821, he proposed granting preemption rights to squatters. He also opposed restrictions on slavery in Missouri and the Louisiana Purchase.|$|E
5|$|At this point, McCain's {{politics}} were mainly {{in line with}} President Ronald Reagan; this included support for Reaganomics, and he was active <b>on</b> <b>Indian</b> Affairs bills. He supported most aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including its hardline stance against the Soviet Union and policy towards Central American conflicts, such as backing the Contras in Nicaragua. McCain opposed keeping U.S. Marines deployed in Lebanon citing unattainable objectives, and subsequently criticized President Reagan for pulling out the troops too late; in the interim, the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing killed hundreds. McCain won re-election to the House easily in 1984, and gained {{a spot on the}} House Foreign Affairs Committee. In 1985, he made his first return trip to Vietnam, and also traveled to Chile where he met with its military junta ruler, General Augusto Pinochet.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{morphological}} features, the Alexandrine parakeet (Psittacula eupatria) {{has been}} proposed as the founder population for all Psittacula species <b>on</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean islands, with new populations settling during the species' southwards colonisation from its native South Asia. Features of that species gradually disappear in species further away from its range. Subfossil remains of Newton's parakeet show that it differed from other Mascarene Psittacula species in some osteological features, but also had similarities, such as a reduced sternum, which suggests a close relationship. Skeletal features indicate an especially {{close relationship with the}} Alexandrine parakeet and the rose-ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameri), but the many derived features of Newton's parakeet indicates it had long been isolated on Rodrigues.|$|E

Features of that species gradually disappear in species further away from its range. Many endemic Mascarene birds, including the dodo, are descended from South Asian ancestors, and Hume has proposed that this {{may also be the}} case for all the parrots there. Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene, so it was possible for species to colonise some of these less isolated islands.|$|E
5|$|Both commanders were {{a product}} of the {{environment}} of European warfare, which generally took place in open fields with relatively easy mobility, and were thus uncomfortable with woodland warfare. Neither liked the irregular warfare practiced by the Indians and British counterparts like Rogers' Rangers, but saw them as a necessary evil, given the operating environment. Although the French depended <b>on</b> <b>Indian</b> support to increase their comparatively small numbers throughout the war, Indian forces were quite low in this battle, and Montcalm generally disliked them and their practices.|$|E

5|$|Clark {{was just}} {{thirty years old}} when the Revolutionary War ended, but his {{greatest}} military achievements were already behind him. After Clark's victories in the Illinois country, settlers continued to pour into Kentucky and live illegally <b>on</b> <b>Indian</b> land north of the Ohio River. From 1784 to 1788 Clark served as the superintendent-surveyor for Virginia's war veterans, surveying lands granted to them for their service in the war. The position brought Clark a small income, but he devoted very little time to the enterprise.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Bankhead was {{replaced}} by Lieutenant Colonel William S. Harney in 1839. Colonel Harney had two earlier encounters with Seminoles, the first a battle in which Chief Arpeika eluded capture, and a second in which Harney escaped in only his shirt and drawers from an early morning attack (the Harney Massacre) on his camp led by Chief Chakaika. In light of these experiences, Harney instituted an intensive training program in swamp and jungle warfare for his men. After Chakaika led the raid <b>on</b> <b>Indian</b> Key in August 1840, Harney set out into the Everglades after Chakaika, and killed him in his own camp. The war quieted down after that, with active pursuit of the Seminoles ending in 1842, {{although some of the}} Seminoles remained hidden in the Everglades.|$|E
5|$|Following the conquests of Alexander the Great in the east, Hellenistic {{influence}} <b>on</b> <b>Indian</b> art was far-ranging. In {{the area}} of architecture, {{a few examples of}} the Ionic order can be found as far as Pakistan with the Jandial temple near Taxila. Several examples of capitals displaying Ionic influences can be seen as far as Patna, especially with the Pataliputra capital, dated to the 3rd century BC. The Corinthian order is also heavily represented in the art of Gandhara, especially through Indo-Corinthian capitals.|$|E

5|$|From 1820 to 1850, Jacksonian {{democracy}} began a set {{of reforms}} which included wider white male suffrage; {{it led to the}} rise of the Second Party System of Democrats and Whigs as the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854. The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that resettled Indians into the west <b>on</b> <b>Indian</b> reservations. The U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist Manifest destiny. The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest. Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest.|$|E
5|$|Gillard {{made her}} prime-ministerial visit to India on 16 October 2012, for a three-day {{bilateral}} meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, where they negotiated the safeguards required {{prior to the}} commencement of uranium trading between India and Australia. The prospect of a quick trading arrangement was downplayed by both leaders in 2012; nevertheless, Gillard's efforts in brokering the deal was a precursor of the agreement being finalised between Prime Minister Tony Abbott and his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, in 2014. This was her second trip to India whilst in Government; on 31 August 2009, Gillard, then–deputy prime minister, met in India with Minister of Human Resource Development Kapil Sibal {{for the purpose of}} discussing the Australian Government's response to the string of attacks <b>on</b> <b>Indian</b> people living in Australia and attending Australian educational institutions.|$|E
5|$|In James Monroe's annual {{address to}} the {{legislature}} in December 1822, he called on Congress to report on how to best deal with the Seminoles that inhabited the recently acquired territory of Florida. As chair of the Committee <b>on</b> <b>Indian</b> Affairs, Metcalfe delivered the report on February 21, 1823. His committee found that, {{under the terms of}} the Adams-Onis Treaty that transferred control of Florida to the United States from Spain, the Seminoles were to be accorded the same privileges as U.S. citizens. Accordingly, the committee recommended that each Seminole family be given a land grant. They hoped that this would help break the tribal loyalties of the Seminoles and expedite their amalgamation into white society. The committee's report was largely ignored.|$|E
