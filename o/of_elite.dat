5|$|The {{development}} of a PlayStation 2 version <b>of</b> <b>Elite</b> Force was announced in late 2000. Whereas the original version <b>of</b> <b>Elite</b> Force had been published by Activision and developed by Raven Software, the PlayStation 2 version was published by Majesco Entertainment and developed by their in-house studio, Pipe Dream Interactive. Elite Force {{was to be the}} second PlayStation 2 project undertaken by Majesco. The PlayStation 2 version of the game includes most of the same content as the computer version of the game, albeit that the game's graphics were simplified slightly for the console. Due to the lack of online support for the PlayStation 2, the port only allows for four players to compete in a multiplayer game. Pipe Dream paid particular attention to adjusting the controls of the game to suit the PlayStation 2's gamepad, introducing an auto-aim feature to assist the player. The first screenshots of the game were released in March 2001, and the game was released on December 11, 2001.|$|E

The sociological theory of elits, with its roots in the analysis of parliamentary democracy, may also be applied to analysing totalitarian systems.

40|$|The article {{points to}} the {{significance}} of Pareto's conception of ideology and his {{distinction between the two}} interpretations of historical materialism (populaire — savante) for modern social sciencies. The author questions the view that Pareto constructs a juxtaposition of theory of classes and class struggle with the theory <b>of</b> <b>elites</b> and the law of the circulation <b>of</b> <b>elites.</b> The author indicates that Pareto's theory <b>of</b> <b>elites</b> assumes the defence of Marx's theory of classes and his theory of class struggle against recurrent criticism, such as: glorification of violence in social life, discrepancy between the class struggle and humanism, law, religious values. Pareto's conception of class struggle, his distinction between „la violence" and „la force" shed new light on his theory <b>of</b> <b>elites.</b> Pareto's theory <b>of</b> <b>elites</b> may than be rid of naturalistic determinism, ahistorism and antidemocratism and may no longer be treated as the expression of the attitude of contempt towards the masses. It reveals its antielitist consequences and is in agreement with liberal values accepted by Pareto.

5|$|According to {{historian}} Charles Coulson {{the accumulation}} of wealth and resources, such as food, led {{to the need for}} defensive structures. The earliest fortifications originated in the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, Egypt, and China where settlements were protected by large walls. Northern Europe was slower than the East to develop defensive structures and {{it was not until the}} Bronze Age that hill forts developed and began to spread across Europe. In the medieval period castles were influenced by earlier forms <b>of</b> <b>elite</b> architecture, contributing to regional variations. Importantly, while castles had military aspects, they contained a recognisable household structure within their walls, reflecting the multi-functional use of these buildings.|$|E

At the same time, the skeptical turn of the Classical age became even more pronounced.

5|$|Meanwhile, {{new types}} of burials and more {{imposing}} ones have been unearthed, which display {{a great variety of}} luxurious objects. Among the various burial types, the shaft grave became the most common form <b>of</b> <b>elite</b> burial, a feature that gave the name to the early period of Mycenaean Greece. Among the Mycenaean elite, deceased men were usually laid to rest in gold masks and funerary armor, and women in gold crowns and clothes gleaming with gold ornaments. The royal shaft graves next to the acropolis of Mycenae, in particular the Grave Circles A and B signified the elevation of a native Greek-speaking royal dynasty whose economic power depended on long-distance sea trade.|$|E
5|$|Since {{before the}} start of the American Revolution, Boston and New York City have shared an intense rivalry as cities.

During this time period, New York was often looked down upon as the upstart, over-populated, dirty cousin to aristocratic and clean Boston.|$|E

40|$|This study aims at {{understanding}} the behavior <b>of</b> economic <b>elites.</b> To do so, the paper presents a theoretical model <b>of</b> economic <b>elites,</b> which assumes a different behavior <b>of</b> <b>elites</b> for the First World and the First World economies. The paper then examines the empirical data of Peru {{to see whether}} they are consistent with the predictions of the theory and, indeed, finds consistency. At this stage of research, the theory <b>of</b> economic <b>elites</b> seems promising for explaining certain facts of the Third World: economic elites do not circulate endogenously; in addition, reforms in the market/state mix of the economy do not induce this circulation. If economic growth depends on the competitiveness of the economy, which in turn depends on more entrepreneurial capitalists, the latter depends, as suggested by the findings of this paper, on the circulation <b>of</b> <b>elites</b> (on the competition in this sphere, a kind of meta-competition). ...|$|R
5|$|The {{domestic}} dwellings <b>of</b> <b>elite</b> {{and ordinary}} Egyptians alike were constructed from perishable {{materials such as}} mud bricks and wood, and have not survived. Peasants lived in simple homes, while the palaces of the elite and the pharaoh were more elaborate structures.

Important structures such as temples and tombs that were intended to last forever were constructed of stone instead of mud bricks. The architectural elements used in the world's first large-scale stone building, Djoser's mortuary complex, include post and lintel supports in the papyrus and lotus motif.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} occupations could be chosen or {{inherited}} from a father's line of work. This would include – {{but was not}} limited to – coffinmakers, ironworkers and blacksmiths, tailors, cooks and noodle-makers, retail merchants, tavern, teahouse, or winehouse managers, shoemakers, seal cutters, pawnshop owners, brothel heads, and merchant bankers engaging in a proto-banking system involving notes of exchange. Virtually every town had a brothel where female and male prostitutes could be had. Male catamites fetched a higher price than female concubines since pederasty with a teenage boy was seen as a mark <b>of</b> <b>elite</b> status, regardless of sodomy being repugnant to sexual norms. Public bathing became much more common than in earlier periods. Urban shops and retailers sold a variety of goods such as special paper money to burn at ancestral sacrifices, specialized luxury goods, headgear, fine cloth, teas, and others. Smaller communities and townships too poor or scattered to support shops and artisans obtained their goods from periodic market fairs and traveling peddlers. A small township also provided a place for simple schooling, news and gossip, matchmaking, religious festivals, traveling theater groups, tax collection, and bases of famine relief distribution.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{original}} PC version <b>of</b> <b>Elite</b> Force gained critical acclaim, the 2001 PlayStation 2 port received a more negative reception. Majesco's port {{of the game}} garnered mediocre reviews, holding scores of 54 percent and 52 percent on Game Rankings and Metacritic respectively. While the level design, story and atmosphere were praised, critics were negative towards what was seen to be a poorly performed port, with complaints focused on difficult controls, graphical problems and frame rate issues. In addition, the artificial intelligence was deemed to be significantly worse than the earlier PC incarnation of the game. Several reviews suggested that Majesco had simply not put effort into the port, resulting in a level of quality behind that which was expected of PlayStation 2 games at the time.|$|E

Such was his notoriety that the French falsely claimed to have killed him during the fighting. He commanded a 2,400-man brigade at the Battle of Borghetto on 30 May and during the Siege of Mantua.

During the second attempt to relieve the Siege of Mantua, he joined Paul Davidovich's Tyrol Corps. He was badly injured in a fall the night before the Battle of Rovereto, which occurred on 4 September. Nevertheless, he led his brigade during the day's fighting. His troops bravely tried to stop Masséna's advance, but they were finally routed by superior numbers.|$|E
