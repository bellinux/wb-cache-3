5|$|The {{storming}} of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, {{had been}} celebrated annually since 1790, initially through quasi-religious rituals, {{and then later}} during the Revolution with grand, secular events including the burning of replica Bastilles. Under Napoleon the events became less revolutionary, focusing instead on military parades and national unity {{in the face of}} foreign threats. During the 1870s, the 14 July celebrations became a rallying point for Republicans opposed to the early monarchist leadership of the Third Republic; when the moderate Republican Jules Grévy became president in 1879, his new government turned the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille into a national holiday. The anniversary remained contentious, with hard-line Republicans continuing to use the occasion to protest against the new political order and right-wing conservatives protesting about the imposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holiday.</b> The July Column itself remained contentious and Republican radicals unsuccessfully tried to blow it up in 1871.|$|E

5|$|Skopje has {{a diverse}} nightlife. There {{is a large}} {{emphasis}} on casinos, {{many of which are}} associated with hotels, such as that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holiday</b> Inn.

Among young people the most popular destinations are bars, discos, and nightclubs which {{can be found in the}} center and the City Park. Among the most popular nightclubs are Midnight, Hard Rock, Maracana, B2, Havana and Colosseum where world-famous disc jockeys and idiosyncratic local performances are frequent.

Nighttime concerts in local, regional and global music are often held at the Philip II National Arena and Boris Trajkovski Sports Center. For middle-aged people, places for having fun are also the kafeanas where traditional Macedonian food is served and traditional Macedonian Music (Starogradska muzika) is played, but music from all the Balkans, particularly Serbian folk music is also popular.

25|$|At first, {{observers}} of Kwanzaa avoided the mixing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holiday</b> or its symbols, values, and practice with other holidays, as {{doing so would}} violate the principle of kujichagulia (self-determination) and thus violate the integrity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holiday,</b> which is partially intended as a reclamation of important African values. Today, many African American families celebrate Kwanzaa along with Christmas and New Year's. Frequently, both Christmas trees and kinaras, the traditional candle holder symbolic of African American roots, share space in Kwanzaa-celebrating households.
