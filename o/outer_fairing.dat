Aims The first genetic screen of the North-east Atlantic island subspecies of (Winter) Wren Troglodytes troglodytes was performed to resolve their relationship to mainland Eurasian and Nearctic populations. Methods The ND 2 gene was sequenced from 15 wrens from Iceland, Faroe Islands, St Kilda, <b>Outer</b> Hebrides, <b>Fair</b> Isle and Shetland (2 – 3 individuals of each subspecies) and compared with Eurasian Wrens from mainland Britain and Europe, and Winter Wrens from North America. Results All island subspecies were shown to originate from European rather than Nearctic founders. Genetic divergence from mainland British and European populations was small (0. 1 – 0. 3...|$|R
40|$|Instability of {{deepwater}} riser with fairings is {{investigated in}} this study. Despite the advantages over other devices for suppressing vortex-induced-vibration (VIV), fairings may be susceptible to flutter type instability. A two-body mathematical model is {{established for the}} coupled transverse-torsion motion of a top tensioned riser with fairings. The inner part (riser) can only move transversely while the <b>outer</b> part (<b>fairing)</b> has transverse-torsion motion. The effect of the transverse velocity on the angle of attack is taken into account and damping is considered for both degrees of freedom. An eigenvalue analysis is employed to examine the issue of stability. The emphasis is on identifying the critical current speed for a given riser and fairing configuration. The effects of key parameters are investigated and {{the results indicate that}} the section hydrodynamic characteristics of the fairings {{have a significant impact on}} the instability...|$|R
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical depression, the cyclone maintained <b>outer</b> rainbands and <b>fair</b> outflow. It tracked southeastward around the northeastern periphery of an anticyclone over Florida. By August 6, the convection had diminished as outflow became restricted due to northeasterly wind shear; {{with a relatively}} dry environment, most of the convection was confined to the southern semicircle of the depression. Despite the circulation becoming elongated in the southwesterly flow of a southward moving cold front, a Hurricane Hunters flight late on August 6 reported that the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Cristobal about 315miles (505km) east of Jacksonville, Florida.|$|R
5000|$|The {{park was}} built on a {{rectangular}} block bounded by North 7th, 8th, Chambers, and Burleigh Streets. Home plate was positioned {{at the south end}} (Chambers) with the outfield bounded by the <b>outer</b> fence, making <b>fair</b> territory itself home-plate shaped, with short fields in left and right and very deep power alleys. This was a design used by a number of ballparks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when they were confined to a block that was too narrow to allow the foul lines to parallel the streets. The best-known example of this [...] "bathtub" [...] design is likely the Polo Grounds in New York City, home of the New York Giants through 1957.|$|R
40|$|A new infra red camera (IR) {{for high}} {{resolution}} infra red studies for the outer divertor target plate in JET has been installed. Shot integrated energy balance between tile embedded thermocouples and IR based estimation of deposited energy on the <b>outer</b> tile gives <b>fair</b> {{agreement in the}} range of 80 - 120 %. The assumptions of the temporal evolution of type-I ELMs power load as made for ITER define a lower, conservative boundary within the observed variation of the data. The broadening of the ELM induced power profiles are, in contrast to earlier results based on a lower resolution IR system at JET, found to be {{in the range of}} 1. 4 - 4. 3 when compared to the inter-ELM wetted area.

40|$|To further {{validate}} a stochastic {{particle deposition}} model, three-dimensional deposition patterns predicted by that model {{were compared with}} corresponding spatial particle deposition data obtained from SPECT measurements. In the in vivo inhalation experiments, two different polydisperse aerosols with mass median aerodynamic diameters of 1. 6 ? m and 6. 8 ? m were inhaled by 12 test subjects, using different nebulizers. Predicted and measured deposition data were compared on three different levels: (1) total lung deposition, (2) deposition per hemispherical shell, and (3) deposition per airway generation. First, experimental and theoretical total lung deposition data showed good agreement for both the fine (65 ± 9 % vs. 55 ± 21 %) and the coarse aerosols (55 ± 8 % vs. 46 ± 4 %). Second, predicted deposition per hemispherical shell also corresponded well with the experimental data, both exhibiting small deposition fractions in the inner shells and a roughly quadratic increase in the <b>outer</b> shells. Third, <b>fair</b> agreement was observed for the deposition fractions per airway generation, both experimental data and modelling predictions exhibiting relatively small deposition fractions in central bronchial airway generations, followed by a steep increase in the peripheral respiratory airways. While the overall agreement between measured SPECT data and computed deposition fractions demonstrates that SPECT data can indeed be used for model validation, the current spatial resolution of the SPECT method allows only a limited validation of model predictions at the single airway generation level...|$|R
40|$|The {{copyright}} {{fair use}} caselaw is more coherent and more predictable than many commentators seem to believe. Fair use cases tend {{to fall into}} common patterns, or what this Article calls policy-relevant clusters. The policies underlying modern fair use law include promoting {{freedom of speech and}} of expression, the ongoing progress of authorship, learning, access to information, truth telling or truth seeking, competition, technological innovation, and the privacy and autonomy interests of users. If one analyzes putative fair uses in light of cases previously decided in the same policy cluster, it is generally possible to predict whether a use is likely to be fair or unfair. Policy-relevant clustering is not a substitute for appropriate consideration of the statutory fair use factors, but it provides another dimension to fair use analysis that complements the four-factor analysis and sharpens awareness about how the statutory factors, sometimes supplemented by other factors, should be analyzed in particular contexts. Parts I through V mainly provide a positive account of how fair use has been adjudicated in a variety of contexts and suggestions about factors that should be given greater or lesser weight in certain fair use policy clusters. Its articulation of the policy-relevant clusters into which the fair use cases typically fall should not, however, be understood as attempting to limn the <b>outer</b> bounds of <b>fair</b> use or to foreclose the development of new policy-relevant clusters. This Article concludes by offering a more normative account of fair use as an integral and essential part of U. S. copyright law that can, in fact, encompass the wide range of fair uses discussed, by recapping the key lessons from this Article’s qualitative assessment of the fair use caselaw, and by pointing to some encouraging trends in recent cases...|$|R
60|$|It is {{commonly}} the loose and latitudinarian Christians who pay quite indefensible compliments to Christianity. They talk {{as if there}} had never been any piety or pity until Christianity came, a point on which any mediaeval would have been eager to correct them. They represent that the remarkable thing about Christianity was that it was the first to preach simplicity or self-restraint, or inwardness and sincerity. They will think me very narrow (whatever that means) if I say that the remarkable thing about Christianity was that it was the first to preach Christianity. Its peculiarity was that it was peculiar, and simplicity and sincerity are not peculiar, but obvious ideals for all mankind. Christianity was the answer to a riddle, not the last truism uttered after a long talk. Only the other day I saw in an excellent weekly paper of Puritan tone this remark, that Christianity when stripped of its armour of dogma (as who should speak of a man stripped of his armour of bones), turned out to be nothing but the Quaker doctrine of the Inner Light. Now, if I were to say that Christianity came into the world specially to destroy the doctrine of the Inner Light, that would be an exaggeration. But it would be very much nearer to the truth. The last Stoics, like Marcus Aurelius, were exactly the people who did believe in the Inner Light. Their dignity, their weariness, their sad external care for others, their incurable internal care for themselves, were all due to the Inner Light, and existed only by that dismal illumination. Notice that Marcus Aurelius insists, as such introspective moralists always do, upon small things done or undone; it is because he has not hate or love enough to make a moral revolution. He gets up early in the morning, just as our own aristocrats living the Simple Life get up early in the morning; because such altruism is much easier than stopping the games of the amphitheatre or giving the English people back their land. Marcus Aurelius is the most intolerable of human types. He is an unselfish egoist. An unselfish egoist {{is a man who has}} pride without the excuse of passion. Of all conceivable forms of enlightenment the worst is what these people call the Inner Light. Of all horrible religions the most horrible is the worship of the god within. Any one who knows any body knows how it would work; any one who knows any one from the Higher Thought Centre knows how it does work. That Jones shall worship the god within him turns out ultimately to mean that Jones shall worship Jones. Let Jones worship the sun or moon, anything rather than the Inner Light; let Jones worship cats or crocodiles, if he can find any in his street, but not the god within. Christianity came into the world firstly in order to assert with violence that a man had not only to look inwards, but to look outwards, to behold with astonishment and enthusiasm a divine company and a divine captain. The only fun of being a Christian was that a man was not left alone with the Inner Light, but definitely recognized an <b>outer</b> light, <b>fair</b> as the sun, clear as the moon, terrible as an army with banners.|$|R
40|$|Fair use {{has been}} invoked {{as a defense}} to claims of {{copyright}} infringement in {{a wide array of}} cases over the past thirty years, as when someone has drawn expression from an earlier work in order to parody it, quoted from an earlier work in preparing a new work on the same subject, published a photograph as part of a news story, made a time-shift copy of television programming, photocopied a document for submission as evidence in a litigation, reverse engineered a computer program to get access to interface information, cached websites to facilitate faster access to them, or provided links to images available on the Internet, just to name a few. The wide array of fair use cases has led many commentators to complain that fair use is unpredictable. This Article argues that fair use law is both more coherent and more predictable than many commentators have perceived once one recognizes that fair use cases tend to fall into common patterns, or what this Article will call policy-relevant clusters. The policies underlie modern fair use law include promoting freedom of speech and of expression, the ongoing progress of authorship, learning, access to information, truth-telling or truth-seeking, competition, technological innovation, and privacy and autonomy interests of users.
