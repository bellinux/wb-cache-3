Drugstore beetles often enter a home in bulk items like bird seed, grass seed, or dry pet food, where several generations of beetles can develop unnoticed until some of the adults eventually leave to infest new locations. Telltale signs of infested items are shot-like holes puncturing the <b>outside</b> <b>packaging</b> of food items and pockmarking solid items like crackers and pasta, as well as loose powder at the bottom of storage bags.

40|$|Chronic {{suffering}} {{plays an}} important role in the current concerns of health professionals. The recent narrative medicine trend indicates the relevance of a new rapport between providers of services and the persons and the families involved. We investigate a possible analogy between models of relationship, as described by fictional texts analyzed by Umberto Eco in his "Six Walks in the Fictional Woods", and stories developed by the narrative therapist and the person whose story is in the center. The analogy applies to the relationship therapist-person in narrative therapy and the relationship author - reader in a fictional text. We indicate a metaphoric presentation of this relationship, as it is depicted in the science fiction novel “Roadside Picnic” by brothers Arkady and Boris Strugatski. The resulting thematic categories are: speed and completeness of the unfolding story, examples of metaphors in the story: the guide and the means of transportation, the audience of the story, the relationship between <b>outside</b> (<b>packaging)</b> and inside (core) of the story, the search for a particular meaning for each listener/reader, the usage of story, the story final destination, etc. The analogy underlines aspects of the narrative competence required for the mental health professional or caretaker, so that he or she can create a space of story enrichment and meaning-making in cooperation with the patient...|$|E

40|$|Purpose of review: The present review {{provides}} an overview of insect pest species associated with packaged-food products, potential mechanisms leading to infestation of packaged products, and strategies to prevent such infestation. Findings: There are two possible reasons that may explain the presence of insects in packaged products: (1) insects are present in the product before packaging, or (2) insects invaded the product after packaging from already existing openings or from insects creating an entry point. Control strategies include the correct identification of the species found in the packaged product, mechanical or thermal methods for eliminating infestations in raw and processed products, use of repellents or insecticides <b>outside</b> <b>packages,</b> and application of modified or controlled atmospheres inside packages. Directions for future research: Further research is required on the above topics focusing on all stages of food manufacture and distribution for successful prevention of insect presence in packaged products. © 2011 Stewart Postharvest Solutions (UK) Ltd...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the inclusion of}} a linearized state-space small-signal stability (SSS) module to the transient simulation program PSCAD/EMTDC. It combines small-signal stability assessment, with the proven user interface capabilities of PSCAD. The motivation for developing the package is to provide small-signal stability assessment of case studies on PSCAD, and an adaptable simulation background for users to carry out conventional controller design without the need for an <b>outside</b> <b>package.</b> The SSS module, once fully developed, will be capable of incorporating all the system models available on PSCAD. The parameters necessary for the SSS analysis are self generated using a Software program. SSS is capable of carrying out Eigenvalue analysis. In addition it can plot step and pulse responses on the PSCAD output windows together with the EMT results. The capabilities of SSS are illustrated using the benchmark 12 -bus system. Validation of the development has been checked by comparison of the Eigen variables with those of SSAT, and pulse responses with PSCAD. The system is further analysed to show how Eigenvalues obtained from SSS analysis of an unstable system may be made use of to stabilize the system before EMT simulation.

The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) {{have been widely used}} to better understand food thermal process, one of the safest and most frequently used methods for food preservation. However, no consistency in mathematical models has been observed, especially on the boundary conditions definition. The present study has evaluated four methodologies for the definition of boundary conditions for heating water in two commercial bottles: (M 1) temperature profile of heating water (T infinity) and convective heat transfer coefficient (h), (M 2) T infinity as boundary condition for the <b>outside</b> <b>package</b> wall, (M 3) T infinity as boundary condition for the outside heated liquid edge, and (M 4) internal temperature profile (T=T(x,y,z,t)), previously measured in the inner package wall, as boundary condition for the outside heated liquid edge. Models that considered the measured value of h e T infinity as boundary condition showed good agreement with experimental values, compared by thermal history and sterilization value (F). The models that considered the temperature profile of the heating water or the inner package wall as boundary conditions, showed faster heating. By over-estimating the product heating rate, those models are not appropriated for thermal process modelling, as it compromises the safety and preservation of food products...|$|R
