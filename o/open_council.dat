2500|$|It is {{considered}} the [...] "First Independent City of Peru" [...] for three reasons: it proclaimed independence from Spain on December 24, 1820 at the historical [...] "Casa de la Emancipación" [...] (House of Emancipation). Its leaders signed {{the declaration of independence}} at the Seminario de San Carlos y San Marcelo and proclaimed independence to an <b>open</b> <b>council</b> meeting in the Plaza de Armas, on December 29, 1820. Finally, on January 6, 1821 its leaders ratified the agreement and the proclamation of the independence of this city, as stated in the document called Libro rojo (the Red Book) of the Trujillo council.|$|E
2500|$|In 1953, Bloomington {{changed from}} a {{township}} to a village form of government. [...] This more professional approach to government was accompanied by <b>open</b> <b>council</b> meetings, land use plans, and published budgets. [...] The effects of this new form of government began immediately, first {{with the formation of}} the city police department (at a cost of $2 per taxpayer) and secondly with the first park land acquisition. [...] Both Bush Lake Beach and Moir Park were established at a cost of one dollar to each residence. Today, about 1/3 of the city's land area is devoted to city and regional parks, playgrounds, and open space. In 1956, the first city land-use plan was initiated with the construction of Interstate 35W and Metropolitan Stadium.|$|E
2500|$|Law 7/1985, {{passed by}} the former Spanish President Felipe González Márquez (socialist), lays down the {{procedure}} of the Local Government. Every city in Spain used this Law until 2003. This year, the former Spanish President José María Aznar López (conservative), passed a Law (57/2003) to modernize organic rules of those cities which had more than 250,000 inhabitants, and other important cities (like capital cities of provinces with at least 175,000 inhabitants). Also, it exists two other important Laws for specifically Madrid (Law 22/2006) and Barcelona (Law 1/2006). The main governing body in most municipalities is called Ayuntamiento (in the less populated municipalities an alternative local organization system called <b>open</b> <b>council,</b> [...] "concejo abierto", is used). The Ayuntamiento in turn is formed by the Plenary (el Pleno, the collective formed by the city councillors) and the Mayor. The number of members that compose The Plenary varies depending on city's population (for example, since 2007 Valencia has 33 members and Pamplona has 27). The name given {{to the members of}} the Plenary is councillor (concejal). Those councillors are elected between city's inhabitants every four years by direct vote. After being elected, councillors meet in a special Plenary session to determine who will be elected, between them, as city's Mayor. In the next days after the election, the mayor chooses some councillors to set up the executive governing body (Junta de Gobierno or Comisión de Gobierno). After that, and for the next four years, city's mayor and the Junta de Gobierno will govern over the city according to their competences (urbanism, some taxes, local police, licenses for specific activities, cleaning services, etc.). Meanwhile, councillors in the Plenary but not part of the Junta de Gobierno (the opposition) will oversee Mayor's rule.|$|E

5000|$|The {{elections}} were direct in towns and municipalities, but indirect in rural areas, where members were elected by 613 [...] "shirs" [...] (<b>open</b> <b>councils)</b> between November 1955 and January 1956. The electoral laws were not applied {{entirely to the}} shirs, where voters could be as young as 15.|$|R
60|$|All {{this changed}} {{for a few}} hours the current of Mrs Dale's thoughts: but in the evening {{she went back to the}} subject of her morning conversation, and before the three ladies went to bed, they held {{together}} an <b>open</b> <b>council</b> of war upon the subject. Dr Crofts had been found to be away from Guestwick, and word had been sent on his behalf that he would be over at Allington early on the following morning. Mrs Dale had almost made up her mind that the malady of her favourite maid was not scarlatina, but had not on that account relaxed her order as to the absence of her daughters from the maid's bedside.|$|E
60|$|So fixed was Clarence in this {{resolution}} to retain all the property himself, and so resolute was Richard, {{on the other}} hand, in his determination to have his share, that the quarrel very soon assumed a very serious character. The lords and nobles of the court {{took part in the}} controversy on one side and on the other, until, at length, there was imminent danger of open war. Finally Edward himself interposed, and summoned the brothers to appear before him in <b>open</b> <b>council,</b> when, after a full hearing of the dispute, he said that he himself would decide the question. Accordingly, the two brothers appeared before the king, and each strenuously argued his own cause. The king, after hearing them, decided how the property should be divided. He gave to Richard and Anne a large share, but not all that Richard claimed. Richard was, however, compelled to submit.|$|E
6000|$|All Europe stood aghast: {{but rather}} with astonishment at English audacity, than with horror at English wickedness. Mary's own French kinsfolk had openly given her up as too bad to be excused, much less assisted. Her own son blustered {{a little to}} the English ambassador; for the majesty of kings was invaded: whereon Walsingham said in <b>open</b> <b>council,</b> that [...] "the queen should send him a couple of hounds, and that would set all right." [...] Which sage advice (being acted on, and some deer sent over and above) was so {{successful}} that the pious mourner, having run off (Randolph says, like a baby to see the deer in their cart), returned for answer that he would [...] "thereafter depend wholly upon her majesty, and serve her fortune against all the world; and that he only wanted now two of her majesty's yeoman prickers, and a couple of her grooms of the deer." [...] The Spaniard was not sorry on the whole for the catastrophe; for all that had kept him from conquering England long ago was the fear lest, after it was done, he might have had to put the crown thereof on Mary's head, instead of his own. But Mary's death was as convenient a stalking-horse to him as to the pope; and now the Armada was coming in earnest.|$|E
