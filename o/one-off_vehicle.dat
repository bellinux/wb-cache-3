5000|$|The SSZ Stradale is an {{automobile}} developed of Tom Zatloukal, an Alfa Romeo racer and restorer. SSZ stands for Sprint Speciale Zatloukal. Based on the Giulietta SS {{the concept was}} to produce a high performance version with a lightweight and wider body than the standard production SS. The original intent was to produce a <b>one-off</b> <b>vehicle</b> for personal use. The car was well received at Alfa club events. Alfa historian Pat Braden nicknamed the car [...] "The Zatmobile" [...] and published photos in Alfa Owner magazine. A second car was built for Joe Benson, author of the Alfa Romeo Buyers Guide. After several other people expressed interest in purchasing a car, SSZ Motorcars was born.|$|E
5000|$|The Egger-Lohner was a carriage-like car {{driven by}} two {{electric}} motors within {{the front wheel}} hubs, powered by batteries. This drive train construction was easily expanded to four-wheel drive, by mounting two more electric motors to the rear wheels, and a four-motor example was ordered by Englishman E. W. Hart in 1900. In December that year, the car was displayed at the Paris World Exhibition under the name Toujours-Contente. Even though this <b>one-off</b> <b>vehicle</b> had been commissioned {{for the purposes of}} racing and record-breaking, its 1,800 kg of lead-acid batteries was a severe shortcoming [...] Though it [...] "showed wonderful speed when it was allowed to sprint", the weight of the batteries rendered it slow to climb hills. It also suffered from limited range due to limited battery life.|$|E

The project began with a problem statement: Build a human powered vehicle that utilizes streamlining to achieve a minimum speed of sixty miles-per-hour. After researching similar vehicles, objectives were formulated as follows. Objectives for the vehicle: • Preserve ergonomic functionality in this unorthodox, <b>one-off</b> <b>vehicle</b> • Provide outstanding mechanical quality, appreciated by serious cyclists • Utilize an existing high-quality frame, readily available • Optimize design for aerodynamic advantage Objectives for the engineering process: • Use advanced CAD/CAM technique...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the research on}} the vehicle dynamics modelling and suspension design for a to be built <b>one-off</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The vehicle is called the Dutch Innovator vehicle, and is designed for travelling around the globe while minimizing the ecological footprint. To accomplish this, the vehicle is propelled by either a full electric or hybrid drivetrain. Combining this with the heavy cabin mounted on top off the chassis to enclose the passengers, the resulting designs are heavy (up to 3500 [kg]) and have a high center of gravity (0 : 95 [m]). The goal of this internship {{is to improve the}} driving behavior of the Dutch Innovator vehicle. This will be done by creating a model to simulate the dynamic behavior of the vehicle under various circumstances. From these simulations, conclusions will be drawn regarding ride and handling of the vehicle and the amount of energy dissipated in the suspension. Furthermore, these results will be used to determine whether the suspension should be adjusted and if it is feasible to improve the driving range by recuperating energy from the suspension. Conclusively it is stated that the Dutch Innovator vehicle combines a not uncomfortable ride with a safe handling. Unfortunately, the energy dissipated in the suspension can not be recuperated to increase the driving range...|$|E

40|$|Using {{registration}} plate analysis, this paper investigates 1) {{the proportions of}} ‘unique’ vehicles, 2) the proportions of vehicles re-appearing from day-to-day and their individual arrival variances and 3) the numbers of locally registered vehicles among those seen during the morning commute period on three roads in Southampton. During incidents, a traffic controller would hope to divert the more familiar drivers onto less congested parts of the network using VMS and other media. Knowing the proportions of regular and unique drivers which make up the peak commuting periods would help in the timely dissemination of this traffic information. The proportions of unique vehicles varied significantly with road and time. Vehicles appearing {{on more than one}} day formed 80 % of the traffic before 08 : 15 but only 60 % between the 08 : 45 and 09 : 00 peak period during the 1996 Bassett Avenue survey (F(4, 20) = 60. 1, p< 0. 001, Mse = 6. 2). Although the proportions of vehicles re-appearing from day to day varied significantly with road, (? 2 (3) = 1501, P< 0. 001), their arrival variances were found to be very similar. On average, 65 % of the returning vehicles re-appeared within +/- 5 minutes of their previous day’s time implying that this frequency of arrival could be part of an habitual behaviour pattern. The results suggest that for occasions where congestion can be anticipated in advance, such as prior to emergency roadworks or special events, warning messages would be most effective before 08 : 30 a. m. when the largest proportion of regular vehicles would be using the roads. If regular users are more familiar with the local road network than <b>one-off</b> ‘unique’ <b>vehicles,</b> and {{would be more likely to}} divert on receiving incident information relevant to their route, then later in the morning, the proportion of knowledgeable local drivers falls substantially...|$|R
40|$|The X- 33 Advantage Technology Demonstrator {{offers a}} rare and {{exciting}} opportunity in Thermal Protection System development. The experimental program incorporates the latest design innovation in re-useable, low life cycle cost, and highly dependable Thermal Protection materials and constructions into both ground based and flight test vehicle validations. The unique attributes of the X- 33 demonstrator for design application validation for the full scale Reusable Launch Vehicle, (RLV), are represented by both {{the configuration of the}} stand-off aeroshell, and the extreme exposures of sub-orbital hypersonic re-entry simulation. There are several challenges of producing a sub-orbital prototype demonstrator of Single Stage to Orbit/Reusable Launch Vehicle (SSTO/RLV) operations. An aggressive schedule with budgetary constraints precludes the opportunity for an extensive verification and qualification program of vehicle flight hardware. However, taking advantage of off the shelf components with proven technologies reduces some of the requirements for additional testing. The effects of scale on thermal heating rates must also be taken into account during trajectory design and analysis. Described in this document are the unique Thermal Protection System (TPS) design opportunities that are available with the lifting body configuration of the X- 33. The two principal objectives for the TPS are to shield the primary airframe structure from excessive thermal loads and to provide an aerodynamic mold line surface. With the relatively benign aeroheating capability of the lifting body, an integrated stand-off aeroshell design with minimal weight and reduced procurement and operational costs is allowed. This paper summarizes the design objectives of the X- 33 TPS, the flight test requirements driven configuration, and design benefits. Comparisons are made of the X- 33 flight profiles and Space Shuttle Orbiter, and lifting body Reusable Launch Vehicle aerothermal environments. The X- 33 TPS is based on a design to cost configuration concept. Only RLV critical technologies are verified to conform to cost and schedule restrictions. The <b>one-off</b> prototype <b>vehicle</b> configuration has evolved to minimize the tooling costs by reducing the number of unique components. Low cost approaches such as a composite/blanket leeward aeroshell and the use of Shuttle technology are implemented where applicable. The success of the X- 33 will overcome the ballistic re-entry TPS mindset. The X- 33 TPS is tailored to an aircraft type mission while maintaining sufficient operational margins. The flight test program for the X- 33 will demonstrate that TPS for the RLV is not simply a surface insulation but rather an integrated aeroshell system...|$|R
40|$|Organizations {{that are}} {{successful}} and competitive long-term {{have learned to}} efficiently utilize their resources, such as money, people, facilities, and time. Over the last half-century, {{there have been a}} variety of theories and techniques put forth on how to do this. One recent theory applied in the aerospace industry is Lean Management (LM), which emphasizes a customer focus and a rigorous elimination of activities that do not add value from the customer’s perspective. LM has not, until now, been evaluated for small, nonprofit, one-off production organizations (NOPOs). Previous research on LM focused on for-profit companies and large-scale production organizations, producing relatively similar products repetitively (e. g. automobiles, commercial satellites, aircraft, and launch <b>vehicles).</b> <b>One-off</b> production organizations typically create one-of-a-kind products. The purpose of this research is to examine the applicability of LM to a NOPO. LM will improve resource utilization and thereby competitiveness, as well as exploring a new area of knowledge and research. The research methodology consists of conducting case studies, formal and informal interviews, observation and analysis in order to assess whether and how LM may be beneficial. The research focuses on one particular NOPO, BioServe Space Technologies (BST) : a nonprofit, payload development organization. Additional NOPOs were interviewed in order to draw more generalized conclusions about LM benefits. The research demonstrates that LM is applicable to NOPOs, thus providing a tool to improve efficiency and competitiveness. Results from this research are guidelines for payload development organizations to implement LM, and highlighting potential LM weaknesses. A major conclusion is that LM needs some minor modifications to be applicable and useful to NOPOs, particularly in terms of value stream mapping. The LM implementation roadmap developed for NOPOs introduces customized metrics, as well as including standard LM ideas. The metrics address efficiency; customer and stakeholder satisfaction; research value; and employee education. LM will improve resource utilization, while retaining the NOPO 2 ̆ 7 s hallmarks of adaptability and flexibility...|$|R
