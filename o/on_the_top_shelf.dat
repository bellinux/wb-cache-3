For the buying behavior analysis, the camera is placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of <b>the</b> <b>shelves,</b> above the customers.

We introduce a new 3 D model that are fitted to these data in a particle filter framework. First the head and shoulders position is tracked in the 2 D space of the acquisition images. Then the arms poses are tracked in the 3 D space. Finally, we demonstrate that an efficient implementation provides a real-time system...|$|R

The Beowulf manuscript {{is known as the}} Nowell Codex, gaining its name from 16th-century scholar Laurence Nowell. The official designation is [...] "British Library, Cotton Vitellius A.XV" [...] because it was one of Sir Robert Bruce Cotton's holdings in the Cotton library {{in the middle of the}} 17th century. Many private antiquarians and book collectors, such as Sir Robert Cotton, used their own library classification systems.
