Firstly, the concept of intuitionistic fuzzy <b>ordered</b> <b>information</b> systems is {{proposed}} by intro-ducing an intuitionistic fuzzy relation to <b>ordered</b> <b>information</b> systems. Meanwhile, two approximation operators are defined and a rough set approach is established in intu-itionistic fuzzy <b>ordered</b> <b>information</b> systems. Secondly, a ranking approach for all ob-jects is constructed in this system. Thirdly, approximation reduction is addressed in intuitionistic fuzzy <b>ordered</b> decision <b>information</b> system.

Visualising higher <b>order</b> <b>information</b> for moving objects is a challenging task due to the marriage between higher order complexity and dynamic nature of moving objects. Treemap {{is a popular}} visualisation method to display hierarchical information {{as a set of}} nested rectangles, and it is a solid candidate for visualising higher <b>order</b> <b>information.</b> Previous researchers have got less attention to build up treemap with higher <b>order</b> <b>information.</b> This study presents a robust way to represent higher <b>order</b> <b>information</b> for moving objects through treemaps.

40|$|We aim to {{investigate}} intuitionistic fuzzy <b>ordered</b> <b>information</b> systems. The concept of intuitionistic fuzzy <b>ordered</b> <b>information</b> systems is proposed firstly by introducing an intuitionistic fuzzy relation to <b>ordered</b> <b>information</b> systems.

Theories of rough set are investigated in intuitionistic fuzzy <b>ordered</b> <b>information</b> systems by defining two approximation operators. Moreover, judgement theorems and methods of attribute reduction are discussed based on discernibility matrix in the systems, and an illustrative example is employed to show its validity.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} was {{to characterize}} different types of order representations in memory {{as well as the}} processes involved in accessing this <b>order</b> <b>information.</b> Study 1 was conducted to investigate the representation of <b>order</b> <b>information</b> for everyday routines, like ‘going to a restaurant’ and ‘shopping for groceries’. Participants decided whether actions from a given routine were in the correct order. By manipulating the distance between actions it was shown that variables, such as routine familiarity, influenced the processes involved in accessing this <b>order</b> <b>information.</b> Study 2 focused on <b>order</b> <b>information</b> for well-learned sequences, using numbers and months as stimuli. Participants decided whether three numbers, or months, were in the correct. It was shown that the processes involved in accessing this <b>order</b> <b>information</b> differ from those known to be involved in typical magnitude comparison tasks. Study 3 was an fMRI version of the order task with numbers taken from the 2 nd study. The goal of this third study was to compare a magnitude task showing distance effects with an order-judgment task that yields reverse-distance effects. Taken together, these studies reveal that different processes are involved in accessing <b>order</b> <b>information</b> in memory; specifically, scanning, estimation, and long-term memory checking mechanisms. Additionally, this work reveals that the intraparietal sulcus, which has typically been implicated in the processing of magnitude information for numbers, is similarly activated by a task that focuses on <b>order</b> <b>information</b> for numbers...|$|R
40|$|<b>Information</b> {{about the}} <b>order</b> of items in a {{sequence}} can be conveyed either spatially or temporally. The current investigation examines whether these different modes of presentation map onto compatible mental representations of serial order. We examined this issue in three immediate serial recall experiments, in which participants recalled lists of letters in the temporal order they appeared. Each letter in a to-be-remembered sequence was presented in a unique spatial position, with the order of these spatial positions progressing from either left-to-right or from right-to-left. In this way, the visually presented lists contained both temporal and spatial <b>order</b> <b>information.</b> Recall of temporal <b>order</b> <b>information</b> was more accurate with congruent spatial <b>order</b> <b>information</b> ﾖ when the letters progressed from left-to-right, following the typical reading direction of English [...] compared to when the spatial <b>order</b> <b>information</b> was incongruent. These results suggest compatible representations of serial order when sequences are conveyed spatially and temporally...|$|R

40|$|Early reading {{acquisition}} {{skills have}} been linked to verbal short-term memory (STM) capacity. However, the nature of this relationship remains controversial, since verbal STM, like reading acquisition, depends upon the complexity of underlying phonological processing skills. This longitudinal study addressed the relation between STM and reading decoding acquisition by distinguishing between STM for item and STM for <b>order</b> <b>information,</b> based on recent studies showing that STM for item information recruits underlying phonological representations, but not STM for <b>order</b> <b>information.</b> If there is a specific link between STM and reading decoding acquisition, STM for <b>order</b> <b>information</b> should be an independent predictor of reading decoding acquisition. Tasks maximizing STM for serial <b>order</b> or item <b>information,</b> measures of phonological abilities and reading tests were administered to children followed from kindergarten through 1 st grade. We observed that order STM capacity but not item STM capacity predicted independent variance in reading decoding abilities one year later. These results highlight the specific role of STM for order in reading decoding acquisition, and argue for a causal role of order STM capacity in reading acquisition. Mechanisms relating STM for <b>order</b> <b>information</b> and reading acquisition will be discussed. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Set-valued {{information}} systems are generalized models of single-valued {{information systems}}. Its semantic interpretation {{can be classified}} into two categories: disjunctive and conjunctive. We focus on the former in this paper. By introducing four types of dominance relations to the disjunctive set-valued information systems, we establish a dominance-based rough sets approach, which is mainly based on the substitution of the indiscernibility relation by the dominance relations. Furthermore, we develop {{a new approach to}} sorting for objects in disjunctive set-valued <b>ordered</b> <b>information</b> systems, which is based on the dominance class of an object induced by a dominance relation. Finally, we propose criterion reductions of disjunctive set-valued <b>ordered</b> <b>information</b> systems that eliminate only those information that are not essential from the ordering of objects.

Throughout this paper, we establish in detail the interrelationships among the four types of dominance relations, which include corresponding dominance classes, rough sets approaches, sorting for objects and criterion reductions.

In Experiment 3, merely implied temporal <b>order</b> <b>information</b> was inferred from narratives, affecting comprehension of later sentences like explicitly stated <b>order</b> <b>information.</b> Moreover, inconsistent temporal <b>order</b> <b>information</b> prevented the creation and storage in memory of an integrated situation model.
