The large-scale, quasihorizontal eddy processes were parameterized in terms of time-zonal mean temperature and ozone mixing ratio using the generalized diffusion formulation on a sloping surface. The computed distributions of temperature and ozone mixing ratio in the meridional plane show satisfactory agreement with the observations in different seasons, thus accounting for the considerable discrepancies between the radintive-photochemical equilibrium state and observations. The significant jetlike features such as westerlies in winter and tropical easterlies in summer are wellreproduced in the upper stratosphere.

40|$|The {{road traffic}} sector is an {{important}} anthropogenic source for emissions of NOx, CO and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) which act as precursors {{for the formation of}} tropospheric ozone. The formation of ozone is highly non-linear. This means that the contribution of the road traffic sector can not directly derived from the amount of emitted species, because they are also determined by local emissions of other anthropogenic and natural sources. In addition long range transport of precursors and ozone can {{play an important role in}} determining the local <b>ozone</b> <b>budget.</b> For a complete assessment of the impact of road traffic emissions it is therefore important to resolve both, local emissions and long range transport. This can be archived by the use of the newly developed MECO(n) model system, which on-line couples the global chemistry-climate-model EMAC with the regional chemistry-climate-model COSMO-CLM/MESSy. As both models use the same chemical speciation the boundary conditions are as consistent as possible. This allows a highly consistent model chain from the global to the local scale. To quantify the contribution of the road traffic emissions to the tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>budget</b> in Europe we use an accounting system of the relevant reaction pathways of the different species from different sources (called tagging method). This tagging scheme is implemented consistently on all scales, allowing a direct comparison of the contributions.

An area covering China and most of East Asia is chosen as the study area. Because of the very nevenly distributed emissions and population in China, the budget study has been done by splitting China into three sub-areas, according to the emission distribution and topography of the country. The model results indicate that in Western China (Area 1) dynamic processes are dominating, and the contribution from photochemical ozone production is small. Central and South-East China (Area 2) has on average 65 % of the photochemical ozone production in China, since more than 80 % of the anthropogenic emissions come from this area. Northeast China (Area 3) is influenced both by natural and* 9 nthropogenic emissions. The seasonal variation of <b>ozone</b> <b>budgets</b> was calculated in order to understand how different processes vary with the seasons. The strongest influences of emissions from the continent over the West Pacific region are found in spring, because of the large eastward transport and increased photochemical activities.

Chlorine chemistry becomes especially relevant in the tropospheric MBL and in coastal regions due to the existence of elevated concentrations of chlorine generated from sea-salt aerosols. In this thesis, the kinetic study of the reactions of seven tropospherically important hydrocarbons with chlorine atoms was done at atmospheric pressure and 298 < T < 358 K using a Gas Chromatograph with Flame Ionization Detection. This data set not only compares well with available literature values but also provides a first report on several systems for which no temperature dependent kinetic data existed. Some of these reactions were found to be fast enough to compete with HO radical chemistry in the MBL.

40|$|We {{present a}} case study of {{interleaving}} in the free troposphere of 4 layers of non-tropospheric origin, with emphasis on their residence time in the troposphere. Two layers are stratospheric intrusions at 4. 7 and 2. 2 km altitude with residence times of about 2 and 6. 5 days, respectively. The two other layers at 7 and 3 km altitude were extracted from the maritime planetary boundary layer by warm conveyor belts associated with two extratropical lows and have residence times of about 2 and 5. 75 days, respectively. The event took place over Frankfurt (Germany) in February 2002 and was observed by a commercial airliner from the MOZAIC programme with measurements of ozone, carbon monoxide and water vapour. Origins and residence times in the troposphere of these layers are documented with a trajectory and particle dispersion model. The combination of forward and backward simulations of the Lagrangian model allows the period of time during which the residence time can be assessed to be longer, as shown by the capture of the stratospheric-origin signature of the lowest tropopause fold just about to be completely mixed above the planetary boundary layer. This case study is of interest for atmospheric chemistry because it emphasizes the importance of coherent airstreams that produce laminae in the free troposphere and that contribute to the average tropospheric ozone. The interleaving of these 4 layers also provides the conditions for a valuable case study for the validation of global chemistry transport models used to perform tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>budgets...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{coupling}} {{of chemistry}} with atmospheric transport processes provides {{a mechanism for}} local and regional pollution from heavily populated continental regions to influence tropospheric composition at hemispheric and global scales. In this study we use the FRSGC/UCI 3 -D chemical transport model to quantify the impact of ozone precursors from anthropogenic sources in the United States, Europe and East Asia on regional and global <b>ozone</b> <b>budgets</b> and to identify the key controlling processes. We find that the East Asian region has the greatest potential to affect tropospheric ozone due principally to efficient vertical transport, but that Europe experiences the greatest intercontinental effects due to rapid, short-distance transport from North America. In addition to significant boundary layer ozone production in each region, we find that 25 - 40 % of the total net regional production occurs above 730 hPa in the free troposphere, and that on a hemispheric scale 70 - 85 % of ozone from anthropogenic sources in the upper troposphere, above 400 hPa, is due to in-situ chemistry rather than direct vertical transport. Increased surface ozone concentrations over remote continents are largest in spring and autumn at northern mid-latitudes; while this seasonality is driven by horizontal transport in the free troposphere followed by subsidence, boundary layer and upper tropospheric chemical production make a substantial contribution. Although the effects are greatest in periodic episodes when meteorological conditions are favourable, there is significant enhancement in background ozone concentrations. We suggest that increasing emissions will significantly impact the oxidizing capacity of the troposphere by leading to greater polarization between ozone production and destruction environments...|$|R

The global calculations are discussed in light of other published estimates. Regional budgets are calculated for continental regions, including the American Mid-West, Sahara, and central Europe. These are compared with regional budgets for oceanic regions, including the Azores High and the Tropical Pacific Warm Pool. Furthermore, the coastal region of the UK and Ireland is also considered. The validity of these regional budgets from TOMCAT are discussed by comparing TOMCAT with measurements from a number of aircraft campaigns. The budgets for central Europe and the American Mid-West indicate that continental regions dominate the <b>ozone</b> <b>budget</b> of the northern extratropics. This is in spite of the remote oceanic regions being photochemical sinks for ozone. The regional budget calculations for the UK and Ireland exhibit net photochemical production of ozone in the boundary layer but this is not consistent with available aircraft measurements. This is attributed to the coarse horizontal resolution of the TOMCAT model which results in the model's photochemical budget being more typical of a polluted continental region than a relatively remote one. On the other hand, the ozone photochemical rates calculated for the Azores High and the Tropical Pacific Warm Pool agree rather well with other estimates...|$|E

Recent {{observations of}} reactive bromine species in the tropical MBL showed unexpectedly high levels that could potentially {{have an impact on}} the <b>ozone</b> <b>budget.</b> Uncertainties in the <b>ozone</b> <b>budget</b> are amplified by our poor understanding of the fate of NOx (= NO + NO 2), particularly the importance of nighttime chemical NOx sinks.

The results also suggest that the N 2 O 5 pathway is a negligible NOx sink in this environment. Observations further indicate a possible link between the NO 2 /NOx ratio and the nitrogen isotopic content of nitrate in this low NOx environment, possibly reflecting the seasonal change in the photochemical equilibrium among NOx species. This study demonstrates the relevance of using the stable isotopes of oxygen and nitrogen of atmospheric nitrate in association with concentration measurements to identify and constrain chemical processes occurring in the MBL...|$|E

The measurements were complimentary to similar ones made in the Austral summer during January–February 1995 and both sets of data are used to make a comparison of photochemistry in the remote marine boundary layer in summer and winter. Seasonal measurements of peroxy radicals are compared to both a steady-state analysis and a full model in order to elucidate their relationships to measured O 3, Full-size image (< 1 K) and H 2 O. Calculations of the seasonal concentrations and relationships of OH are consistent with both model and measurements. From a detailed analysis of the <b>ozone</b> <b>budgets</b> accounting for the contributions of photochemistry, deposition and entrainment processes, it is clear that on a seasonal basis there are two major controlling factors working in opposition. The net effect of photochemistry in the remote marine boundary layer is to destroy ozone; this is balanced by entrainment of ozone into the marine boundary layer from the lower free troposphere. Using the measured data, photochemistry represents the dominant loss process for ozone on a seasonal basis varying from 1. 2 ppbv d− 1 in summer (87 % of the ozone loss) to 0. 6 ppbv d− 1 in the winter (64 % of the ozone loss).

Vertical profiles of ozone were measured daily using an instrument known as an ozonesonde, which {{is attached to a}} weather balloon and launch to altitudes in excess of 30 km. These ozone profiles were measured over coastal Las Tablas, Panama (7. 8 N, 80 W) and several times per week at Alajuela, Costa Rica (ION, 84 W). Meteorological systems in the form of waves, detected most prominently in 100 - 300 in thick ozone layer in the tropical tropopause layer, occurred in 50 % (Las Tablas) and 40 % (Alajuela) of the soundings. These layers, associated with vertical displacements and classified as gravity waves ("GW," possibly Kelvin waves), occur with similar stricture and frequency over the Paramaribo (5. 8 N, 55 W) and San Cristobal (0. 925, 90 W) sites of the Southern Hemisphere Additional Ozonesondes (SHADOZ) network. The gravity wave labeled layers in individual soundings correspond to cloud outflow as indicated by the tracers measured from the NASA DC- 8 and other aircraft data, confirming convective initiation of equatorial waves. Layers representing quasi-horizontal displacements, referred to as Rossby waves, are robust features in soundings from 23 July to 5 August.

First, we compare column-ozone amounts from the Beltsville and Edgewood sondes with data from overpassing satellites. Second, processes influencing ozone profile structure are analyzed using Laminar Identification and tracers: sonde water vapor, aircraft CO and NOy. Third, Beltsville ozone profiles and meteorological influences in July 2011 are compared to those from the summers of 2006 - 2010. Sonde-satellite offsets in total ozone during July 2011 at Edgewood and Beltsville, compared to the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), were 3 percent mean absolute error, not statistically significant. The disagreement between an OMIMicrowave Limb Sounder-based tropospheric ozone column and the sonde averaged 10 percent at both sites, with the sonde usually greater than the satellite. Laminar Identification (LID), that distinguishes ozone segments influenced by convective and advective transport, reveals that on days when both stations launched ozonesondes, vertical mixing was stronger at Edgewood. Approximately half the lower free troposphere sonde profiles have very dry laminae, with coincident aircraft spirals displaying low CO (80 - 110 ppbv), suggesting stratospheric influence. <b>Ozone</b> <b>budgets</b> at Beltsville in July 2011, determined with LID, as well as standard meteorological indicators, resemble those of 4 of the previous 5 summers.

The photochemical point model reproduces the observed NO 2 /NO concentration ratio to within 30 %, and has similar success in simulating observed concentrations of peroxides (H 2 O 2, CH 3 OOH), lending confidence in its use to investigate ozone chemistry. It is found that chemical production of ozone balances only half of chemical loss in the tropospheric column over the tropical South Pacific. The net loss is 1. 810 11 molec. /cm 2 /s.

40|$|What are {{the largest}} {{uncertainties}} in modelling ozone in the troposphere, {{and how do they}} affect the calculated <b>ozone</b> <b>budget?</b> Published chemistry-transport model studies of tropospheric ozone differ significantly in their conclusions regarding the importance of the key processes controlling the ozone budget: influx from the stratosphere, chemical processing and surface deposition. This study surveys ozone budgets from previous studies and demonstrates that about two thirds of the increase in ozone production seen between early assessments and more recent model intercomparisons can be accounted for by increased precursor emissions. Model studies using recent estimates of emissions compare better with ozonesonde measurements than studies using older data, and the tropospheric burden of ozone is closer to that derived here from measurement climatologies, 335 &plusmn; 10 Tg. However, differences between individual model studies remain large and cannot be explained by surface precursor emissions alone; cross-tropopause transport, wet and dry deposition, humidity, and lightning make large contributions to the differences seen between models. The importance of these processes is examined here using a chemistry-transport model to investigate the sensitivity of the calculated <b>ozone</b> <b>budget</b> to different assumptions about emissions, physical processes, meteorology and model resolution. The budget is particularly sensitive to the magnitude and location of lightning NOx emissions, which remain poorly constrained; the 3 &ndash; 8 TgN/yr range in recent model studies may account for a 10 % difference in tropospheric ozone burden and a 1. 4 year difference in CH 4 lifetime. Differences in humidity and dry deposition account for some of the variability in ozone abundance and loss seen in previous studies, with smaller contributions from wet deposition and stratospheric influx. At coarse model resolutions stratospheric influx is systematically overestimated and dry deposition is underestimated; these differences are 5 &ndash; 8 % at the 300 &ndash; 600 km grid-scales investigated here, similar in magnitude to the changes induced by interannual variability in meteorology. However, {{a large proportion of the}} variability between models remains unexplained, suggesting that differences in model chemistry and dynamics have a large impact on the calculated <b>ozone</b> <b>budget,</b> and these should be the target of future model intercomparisons...|$|E
40|$|Emissions of {{atmospheric}} species from the engines of subsonic aircraft at cruise altitude (roughly, above seven kilometers) are {{of concern to}} scientists, the aviation industry and policymakers for two reasons. First, water vapor, soot and sulfur oxides, and related heterogeneous processes, may modify clouds and aerosols enough to perturb radiative forcing in the UT/LS (upper troposphere/lower stratosphere). A discussion of these phenomena appears in Chapter 3 of the IPCC Aviation Assessment (1999). An airborne campaign conducted to evaluate aviation effects on contrail, cirrus and cloud formation, is described in Geophysical Research Letters. The second concern arises from subsonic aircraft emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO + NO 2 = NO(sub x)), CO, and hydrocarbons. These species may add to the background mixture of photochemically reactive species that form ozone. In the UT/LS, ozone is a highly effective greenhouse gas. The impacts of subsonic aircraft emissions on tropospheric NO(sub x) and <b>ozone</b> <b>budgets</b> have been studied with models that focus on UT chemistry [e. g. see discussions of individual models in Brasseur et al., 1998; Friedl et al., 1997; IPCC, 1999]. Depending on the model used, projected increases in the global subsonic aircraft fleet from 1992 to 2015 {{will lead to a}} 50 - 100 pptv increase in UT/LS NO. at 12 km (compared to 50 - 150 pptv background) in northern hemisphere midlatitudes. The corresponding 12 -km ozone increase is 7 - 11 ppbv, or 5 - 10 % (Chapter 4 in IPCC, 1999). Two major sources of uncertainties in model estimates of aviation effects are: (1) the often limited degree to which global models - the scale required to evaluate aircraft emissions - realistically simulate atmospheric transport and other physical processes; (2) limited UT/LS observations of trace gases with which to evaluate model performance. In response to the latter deficiency, a number of airborne campaigns aimed at elucidating the effect of aircraft on atmospheric nitrogen oxides and ozone were performed between 1990 and 1996 (see descriptions in Friedl et al., 1997; Brasseur et al., 1998) ...|$|R
40|$|Transport of {{long-lived}} tracers (such as O, CO, and N O) in {{the lower}} stratosphere largely determines {{the composition of the}} entire stratosphere. Stratospheric transport includes the mean residual circulation (with air rising in the tropics and sinking in the polar and middle latitudes), plus two-way isentropic (quasi-horizontal) mixing by eddies. However, the relative importance of two transport components remains uncertain. Previous studies quantified the relative role of these processes based on tropics-wide average characteristics under common assumption of well-mixed tropics. However, multiple instruments provide us with evidence that show significant differences in the seasonal cycle of ozone between the Northern (0 - 20 N) and Southern (0 - 20 S) tropical (NT and ST respectively) lower stratosphere. In this study we investigate these differences in tracer seasonality and quantify transport processes affecting tracers annual cycle amplitude using simulations from Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry Climate Model (GEOSCCM) and Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) and compare them to observations from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on the Aura satellite. We detect the observed contrast between the ST and NT in GEOSCCM and WACCM: annual cycle in ozone and other chemical tracers is larger in the NT than in the ST but opposite is true for the annual cycle in vertical advection. <b>Ozone</b> <b>budgets</b> in the models, analyzed based on the Transformed Eulerian Mean (TEM) framework, demonstrate a major role of quasi-horizontal mixing vertical advection in determining the NTST ozone distribution and behavior. Analysis of zonal variations in the NT and ST ozone annual cycles further suggests important role of North American and Asian Summer Monsoons (associated with strong isentropic mixing) on the lower stratospheric ozone in the NT. Furthermore, multi model comparison shows that most CCMs reproduce the observed characteristic of ozone annual cycle quite well. Thus, latitudinal variations within the tropics have to be considered {{in order to understand the}} balance between upwelling and quasi- horizontal mixing in the tropical lower stratosphere and the paradigm of well mixed tropics has to be reconsidered...|$|R
40|$|Turbulent fluxes of {{sensible}} and latent heat and ozone were measured aboard a German Aerospace Research Establishment motorglider over the Swiss Plateau {{during the first}} field experiment of the Swiss air pollution experiment POLLUMET. In {{the lower part of}} the boundary layer, the ozone fluxes are negative (downward) throughout the day as a result of deposition and photochemical destruction at the surface. In the upper part of the boundary layer, the ozone fluxes tend to be negative until mid-afternoon and then become positive. The change in sign occurs after the ozone concentration in the boundary layer exceeds that in the reservoir above the inversion. Downdrafts bringing air parcels with ozone deficits across the inversion then become major contributors to the flux. The positive fluxes at upper levels result in an increase in flux divergence in mid-afternoon that is balanced by a relatively large source term in the <b>ozone</b> concentration <b>budget.</b> (orig.)

The HALOE data comprise measurements of major source gases and key chemical species involved in the ozone destruction cycles. In comparison to earlier calculations using version 17 of the HALOE data, the calculated ozone destruction rate increases when the updated data version 18 is used. However, as with the previous study using version 17 of the HALOE data, no evidence for a significant model ozone deficit is found...|$|E

Polluted air masses in the boundary layer may be ingested by thunderstorms, rapidly uplifted, and emitted within the anvil outflow in the upper troposphere.

40|$|The present work {{aims for}} a better {{understanding}} of the reactive nitrogen and <b>ozone</b> <b>budgets</b> of the Arctic summer atmosphere. Special focus is paid to the organic nitrogen compound PAN (Peroxyacetyl nitrate), which as temporary reservoir species plays a key role especially during longrange transport of pollutants. For the first time, a chemical ionization - ion trap mass spectrometer (CI-ITMS) was equipped with an I- ion source for the detection of PAN. The new FASTPEX (Fast Measurement of Peroxyacyl nitrates) instrument successfully was deployed aboard the research aircraft Falcon during POLARCAT - GRACE campaign (Polar Study using Aircraft, Remote Sensing, Surface Measurements and Models, of Climate, Chemistry, Aerosols, and Transport - Greenland Aerosol and Chemistry Experiment) in summer 2008, which was conducted within the framework of the International Polar Year (IPY) 2007 - 2009. Continuous in-flight calibrations were performed using a newly set-up isotopic PAN calibration source. An in-flight intercomparison during GRACE showed very good agreement between the PAN measurements of the new FASTPEX instrument and the PAN measurements aboard the research aircraft NASA DC 8. The GRACE measurements revealed that the Arctic free troposphere in summer is heavily perturbed by aged inflow from the boreal fire regions of Canada and Siberia. PAN was found to be the dominant reactive nitrogen species at altitudes between ca. 4 and 9 km. While nitrogen oxide (NO) in the free troposphere was close to the detection limit of several pmol/mol, PAN was abundant at median mixing ratios of ca. 300 pmol/mol. Low photochemical ozone formation was observed in imported pollution plumes. This is the result of fast conversion of NOx (NOx =NO+NO 2) to PAN in young fire emissions, in combination with the high thermal stability of PAN during subsequent transport towards Greenland. A detailed case study provided first observational evidence of an efficient transport pathway for surface emissions into the lowermost stratosphere, which was previously suggested by model simulations. The anthropogenic pollution was detected by enhanced mixing ratios of PAN and CO above the tropopause. Air mass trajectory calculations showed that the Asian emissions were lifted within a warm conveyor belt (WCB) and reached the lowermost stratosphere within a few days after emission...|$|R
