The mass of beetles are able to overcome the chemical defenses of the tree. After the tree's defenses have been exhausted, the beetles emit an anti-aggregation pheromone. The species can stridulate to communicate.|$|E

40|$|Ethiopia has a {{high road}} crash rate in the world. Among the crashes, more than 60 % occur in the capital city, Addis Ababa. The main aim of this {{research}} was to inform policymakers and researchers about the current situations of road crashes in the city to tackle the current unacceptable costs of the road crashes. We analysed road crash data between the years 2010 and 2014. The results showed 14, 263 persons sustained different levels of injuries in which 1, 911 were fatal whereas the rest were serious and minor injuries. Majority of the fatal (79 %) and serious (76 %) injuries were males, and pedestrians (87 %). Most of these crashes were due to the drivers’ not yielding right <b>of</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> pedestrians. On the other hand, an estimated 19 million US dollars cost of property damage was due to the drivers not yielding right <b>of</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> other vehicles. Generally, among other risk factors we assessed including road conditions and asphalt pavement, drivers’ not yielding right <b>of</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> pedestrians and not yielding right <b>of</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> other vehicles were the leading risk factors for road crashes in the city.

5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the Blades of Chaos: {{a pair of}} blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. As the game progresses, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Sun Shield and Gauntlet of Zeus—offering alternative combat options. Kratos only learns three magical abilities, as opposed to four in previous installments, including the Efreet, the Light of Dawn, and Charon's Wrath, giving him a variety <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> attack and kill enemies. He acquires the relic Triton's Lance—similar to Poseidon's Trident in God of War— which allows him to breathe underwater; a necessary ability as parts of the game require {{long periods of time}} there.|$|E

5|$|The game {{takes place}} in the fictional city of Karnaca. After Empress Emily Kaldwin is deposed by the witch Delilah Copperspoon, the player may choose between playing as either Emily or her Royal Protector and father Corvo Attano as they attempt to reclaim the throne. Both Emily and Corvo employ their own array of supernatural abilities, though the player can {{alternatively}} decide to forfeit these abilities altogether. There is a multitude <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> complete missions, from stealth to purposeful violent conflict, navigated through a sandbox environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{permutations}} of B1 are {{the number}} <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> relabel the 9 digits, 9! = 362880. Counting the permutations for B2 is more complicated, because the choices for B2 {{depend on the}} values in B1. (This is a visual representation of the expression given above.) The conditional calculation needs a branch (sub-calculation) for each alternative. Fortunately, there are just 4 cases for the top B2 triplet (r21): it contains either 0, 1, 2, or 3 of the digits from the B1 middle row triplet(r12). Once this B2 top row choice is made, {{the rest of the}} B2 combinations are fixed. The Band1 row triplet labels are shown on the right.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} a pair of blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms. Called Athena's Blades (also known as the Blades of Athena) in this game, they can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. As the game progresses, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Barbarian Hammer, the Spear of Destiny, and periodically, the Blade of Olympus—offering alternative combat options. Although Kratos begins the game with Athena's Blades and the magic ability Poseidon's Rage (both at maximum power), the blade's power is reduced and the magic is relinquished after an encounter with Zeus (Poseidon's Rage can be regained by obtaining a certain urn). As with previous games, Kratos learns to use up to four magical abilities, such as Typhon's Bane that acts as a bow and arrow for distant targets, giving him a variety <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> attack and kill enemies. Other new magical abilities include Cronos' Rage, Head of Euryale, and Atlas Quake. The special ability Rage of the Gods, featured in the previous game is replaced by Rage of the Titans; unlike the previous game, the Rage meter—which allows usage of the ability—does not have to be full in order to use the ability, and can be switched on and off at will.|$|E

5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the Blades of Athena, {{a pair of}} blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. Later in the game, Kratos acquires a new weapon, the Arms of Sparta—a spear and shield offering alternative combat options (e.g., Kratos can use the shield for defense and the spear for offense, such as throwing it at distant targets). Kratos gains a special ability, Thera's Bane, that infuses his blades with fire, and {{is similar to the}} Rage ability in previous games, providing increased attack damage that is strong enough to pierce through enemy armor. As with the Items in God of War III, this ability automatically replenishes itself (represented by the Fire meter), allowing further usage. Both the Arms of Sparta and Thera's Bane are used to overcome environmental obstacles (e.g., certain doors require the use of Thera's Bane to open). Kratos learns to use up to three magical abilities, including the Eye of Atlantis, Scourge of Erinys, and the Horn of Boreas, giving him a variety <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> attack and kill enemies. The relic Poseidon's Trident is retained from the prior installment, which allows him to breathe underwater, a necessary ability as parts of the game require long periods of time there.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> {{classify}} low back pain with no consensus that any one method is best. There are three general types of low back pain by cause: mechanical back pain (including nonspecific musculoskeletal strains, herniated discs, compressed nerve roots, degenerative discs or joint disease, and broken vertebra), non-mechanical back pain (tumors, inflammatory conditions such as spondyloarthritis, and infections), and referred pain from internal organs (gallbladder disease, kidney stones, kidney infections, and aortic aneurysm, among others). Mechanical or musculoskeletal problems underlie most cases (around 90% or more), and of those, most (around 75%) {{do not have a}} specific cause identified, but are thought to be due to muscle strain or injury to ligaments. Rarely, complaints of low back pain result from systemic or psychological problems, such as fibromyalgia and somatoform disorders.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> {{approach}} the game's situations: players can use a violent approach and shoot their way through environments while using cover to hide from enemy fire. Alternately, Adam can take a stealthy approach, avoiding guards and security devices, again using cover to avoid enemy sight lines. Adam can move between cover elements and around corners while staying hidden. The melee takedown system offers lethal and non-lethal options, {{in addition to an}} assortment of lethal and non-lethal weapons. Adam can also move the bodies of enemies into hiding places, preventing them from being seen and raising an alarm. A key part of Adam's abilities are augmentations, which can be acquired and upgraded using Praxis Kits either bought from special vendors, found in the game environments, or are automatically unlocked by leveling up: higher-level augmentations require more Praxis Kits to unlock. Augmentation functions can range from passive enhancements to Adam's vision or damage resistance, to active upgrades such as allowing Adam to fall from great heights without being injured or increase his strength. Some augmentations are dependent on Adam's energy level, deactivating after an amount of energy has been drained.|$|E

5|$|Unlike in {{previous}} games, magical abilities are learned with {{the acquisition of}} a new weapon, giving each weapon its own magic attack; for example, the Army of Sparta may only be used with the Blades of Exile. Magic gives Kratos a variety <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> attack and kill enemies, such as the Claws of Hades' Soul Summon ability, which conjures souls to attack enemies. Other magic includes the Nemean Cestus' Nemean Roar and the Nemesis Whip's Nemesis Rage. In addition to four primary weapons, three secondary ones, known as Items, are acquired: the Bow of Apollo, the Head of Helios, and the Boots of Hermes. All three are required to advance in certain stages of the game; for example, the Head of Helios {{can be used as}} a lantern in dark areas and to reveal hidden doorways.|$|E
5|$|Shelley, {{who visited}} the toddler Allegra while she was being boarded with a family chosen by Byron, objected to the child's living {{arrangements}} over the years, though he had initially approved of Clairmont's plan to relinquish her to her father. During the summer of 1819, Allegra stayed with four different families and was abandoned by her nursemaid. Byron sent her to stay for long periods with his friend, British consul Richard Belgrave Hoppner, but Hoppner's wife didn't like Allegra and sent her to stay with three other families in as many months. Though he'd originally agreed to permit Clairmont to visit their daughter, Byron reneged on the agreement. Shelley often tried to persuade Byron to let Clairmont see her daughter and they thought <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> regain custody of her. Clairmont was alarmed by reports in 1820 that her daughter had suffered a malarial-type fever and that Byron had moved her to warm Ravenna {{at the height of}} the summer. Clairmont wrote that Allegra must be moved to a more healthy climate if she was to survive and pleaded with Byron to send their daughter to her in Bagni di Lucca, a town with a cool mountain climate. However, Byron didn't want to send Allegra back to be raised in the Shelley household, where he was sure she'd grow ill from eating a vegetarian diet and would be taught atheism. He pointed out that all of the other children in the Shelley household had died: the Shelleys' first three children had all died young and their fourth child, Elena Adelaide Shelley, died in a foster home in 1820 at age seventeen months.|$|E
