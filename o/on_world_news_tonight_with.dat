40|$|From {{climate change}} {{to the war on}} terror, from {{financial}} meltdowns to forced migrations, from pandemics to world poverty and from humanitarian disasters to the denial of human rights, these and other global crises represent the dark side of our global age. They are spawned by it. When represented within today’s <b>world</b> <b>news</b> ecology such ‘global crises’ can also shape processes of globalization — deepening our sense of globality and, possibly, contributing to what Ulrich Beck’s discerns as a ‘cosmopolitan outlook’ (Beck, 2006). With too few exceptions, however, researchers have yet to theorize and examine today’s endemic, interpenetrating and proliferating global crises or their complex dependencies <b>on</b> the <b>world’s</b> <b>news</b> media and emergent forms of global journalism.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present an}} {{evolutionary}} multi-branch tree clustering method to model hierarchical topics and their evolutionary patterns over time. The method builds evolutionary trees in a Bayesian online filtering framework. The tree construction is formulated as an online posterior estimation problem, which well balances both the fitness {{of the current}} tree and the smoothness between trees. The state-of-the-art multi-branch clustering method, Bayesian rose trees, is employed to generate a topic tree with a high fitness value. A constraint model is also introduced to preserve the smoothness between trees. A set of comprehensive experiments <b>on</b> real <b>world</b> <b>news</b> data demonstrates that the proposed method better incorporates historical tree information and is more efficient and effective than the traditional evolutionary hierarchical clustering algorithm. In contrast to our previous method [32], we implement two additional baseline algorithms to compare them with our algorithm. We also evaluate {{the performance of the}} clus-tering algorithm based on multiple constraint trees. Furthermore, two case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our algorithm in helping users understand the major hierarchical topic evolutionary patterns in text data.
