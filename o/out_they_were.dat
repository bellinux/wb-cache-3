5|$|The Allied {{casualties}} at the landings {{were very}} light, with only 95killed and 385 wounded. 40 of those casualties {{were caused by}} a rocket-boosted Henschel Hs 293 guided gliding bomb launched from a Do-217 bomber aircraft by a rare appearance of the bomber wing KG 100, which sank the tank landing ship USS LST-282. In conjunction with the sea landing, airborne and glider landings (Mission Albatross followed by Mission Dove, Mission Bluebird, and Mission Canary) around the area of Le Muy were carried <b>out.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> as successful as the beach landings, with only 104 dead, 24 of which were caused by glider accidents and 18 by parachute accidents.|$|E
5|$|Much more {{is known}} of the {{hundreds}} of unique cleitean that decorate the archipelago. These dome-shaped structures are constructed of flat boulders with a cap of turf on the top. This enables the wind to pass through the cavities in the wall but keeps the rain <b>out.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> used for storing peat, nets, grain, preserved flesh and eggs, manure, and hay, and as a shelter for lambs in winter. The date of origin of this St Kildan invention is unknown, but they were in continuous use from prehistoric times until the 1930 evacuation. More than 1,200 ruined or intact cleitean remain on Hirta and a further 170 on the neighbouring islands. House no. 16 in the modern village has an early Christian stone cross built into the front wall, which may date from the 7th century.|$|E

Eventually they did marry but have since split as Abi has decided to become a nun. He's now a part-time policeman as well a dentist.|$|E

According to himself, Edgar was born in Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, and he started using explosives at a young age. He later enlisted in the Army and was dishonourably discharged after only three weeks, when he blew up the mess hall ("turns <b>out</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> only thinking of building a new one").|$|E

25|$|The plot is {{centered}} on a bachelor man called Asker, who wants to see and choose his bride before marriage. His wife quest, however, is difficult because in that time (in the 19th century) based on traditions women were kept at home and when allowed <b>out</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> heavily covered in hijab and because actually you {{were not allowed to}} know who {{you were going to get}} married with in the 19th century.

25|$|It is {{essential}} {{that there is some}} connection between a misrepresentation and a claimant's entry into the contract.

But the House of Lords held that Mr Attwood could not escape the contract, since he did not rely on Mr Small. He relied on his agents.|$|E
25|$|Just {{before midnight}} on 9 February, the troops clambered into boats, {{and they were}} rowed across the Boca Grande Channel to a beach on the {{southern}} end of La Caleta. A few hours later of the next day almost 1,000 English soldiers and sailors were landed safely after Spanish sentries were surprised and killed. They also avoided the poisoned tip stakes which the Spanish had put up. The English troops formed themselves up into attack columns and by wading through the surf as the tide was <b>out</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> able to bypass the outer defences; Drake meanwhile organized a naval diversion.|$|E

This prison ceased operating sometime in the 1980s. Another abandoned landmark is the mansion located {{on the corner of}} Rosas Moreno and Antonio Caso, which used to be the Russian embassy. In the 1980s, it was abandoned then suffered a fire. Today it is a shell with much of its roof caved in. All that remains intact is the pink stone decorative features on its facade.|$|E
25|$|Roman hypocaust {{heating systems}} made {{extensive}} use of fired clay elements: The space beneath {{the floor of a}} room to be heated was supported on robust pillars (pilae), usually made of small, square bricks mortared together, so that the heat from the adjacent furnace could circulate freely. In public and private bath-houses (essential to the Roman way of life), heat was also carried up through the walls in flues made of interlocking box-tiles. Though these were covered up by wall facings both inside and <b>out,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> sometimes manufactured with quite elaborate geometric and even figural decoration. Pipes for water and drainage were also often made of fired clay.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the success}} of the Captain America character, Simon felt Goodman was not paying the pair the promised {{percentage}} of profits, and so sought work {{for the two of them}} at National Comics, (later named DC Comics).

Fearing that Goodman would not pay them if he found <b>out</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> moving to National, the pair kept the deal a secret while they continued producing work for the company. At some point during this time, the duo also produced Fawcett Comics' Captain Marvel Adventures #1 (1941), the first complete comic book starring Captain Marvel following the character's run as star of the superhero anthology Whiz Comics.|$|E
25|$|On 20 February 1965, Perkins and {{his party}} tried to enter the {{swimming}} pool at Moree, where the local council had barred Aboriginal people from swimming since its opening 40 years earlier. In response to this action the riders faced physical opposition from several hundred local white Australians, including community leaders, and were pelted with eggs and tomatoes. These events were broadcast across Australia, and under pressure from public opinion, the council eventually reversed the ban on Aboriginal swimmers. The Freedom Ride then moved on, but on the way <b>out</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> followed by a line of cars, one of which collided with the rear of their bus forcing them to return to Moree where {{they found that the}} council had reneged on their previous decision.

5000|$|The {{physical}} {{risks for}} getting {{this kind of}} genetic testing done are very minimal. The most common requirement is a blood sample. [...] The emotional risks {{on the other hand}} are great. When a person finds <b>out</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a carrier for a specific genetic disorder, dealing with that can be very difficult. In many cases, people who find <b>out</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> carries can become angered or even enraged that they carry a genetic defect that could be passed on to their child. These results can play a role in determining if a couple will have a child together. If both parents are carriers for the same genetic disorder, there is a twenty-five percent chance that any child <b>they</b> have could <b>be</b> affected. When a person finds <b>out</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a carrier, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> always encouraged to talk to a genetic counselor.
