5|$|One notable {{feature of}} string theory and M-theory {{is that these}} {{theories}} require extra dimensions of spacetime for their mathematical consistency.

In order to describe real physical phenomena using these theories, one must therefore imagine scenarios in which these extra dimensions would not be observed in experiments.|$|E
