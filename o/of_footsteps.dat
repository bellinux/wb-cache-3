25|$|In the Argonautica, a 3rd-century BCE Alexandrian epic {{based on}} early material, Jason placates Hecate in a ritual {{prescribed}} by Medea, her priestess: bathed at midnight {{in a stream}} of flowing water, and dressed in dark robes, Jason is to dig a round pit and over it cut the throat of an ewe, sacrificing it and then burning it whole on a pyre next to the pit as a holocaust. He is told to sweeten the offering with a libation of honey, then to retreat from the site without looking back, even if he hears the sound <b>of</b> <b>footsteps</b> or barking dogs. All these elements betoken the rites owed to a chthonic deity.|$|E
500|$|Before {{entering}} service, the batch {{was attached}} to [...] tenders to increase operational range over the Southern Railway's long Western section routes. Despite this advantage, tenders fitted to the eight left-hand drive examples were intended for use with right-hand drive locomotives. This resulted in {{the location of the}} fireman's fittings on the [...] "wrong" [...] side of the cab. The design also necessitated the addition of a step to the footplate, as the boiler backhead was lower than the fall-plate that connected the tender and cab floors. The new batch incorporated a new set <b>of</b> <b>footsteps</b> beneath the front buffer beam, modified slide-bars and the dome was redesigned to incorporate the regulator to ease access during routine maintenance.|$|E
500|$|The new {{locomotives}} {{were completed}} between March and November 1930. They were noticeably {{different from the}} prototype because the Holcroft conjugation mechanism above the outside cylinders was omitted, although the slab-front and angled profile of the outside cylinders was retained. Other variations included a set <b>of</b> <b>footsteps</b> beneath the front buffer beam, reversion to the Nclass cast chimney design and a revised dome that incorporated the regulator to ease access during routine maintenance. Once complete, Nos. A876A880 were attached to flat-sided [...] tenders to increase operational range over the Southern Railway's longer Eastern section routes. No further N1 locomotives were ordered {{after the completion of}} No.A880 as the mechanically similar U1class was capable of undertaking a broader range of tasks. Although intended for intermediate passenger work, the latter's [...] driving wheels were of little disadvantage when used on slower freight duties.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} online {{algorithm}} for planning sequences <b>of</b> <b>footstep</b> locations that encode goal-directed navigation strategies for humanoid robots. Planning footsteps is more general than most existing navigation methods designed for wheeled robots, since the options of stepping over or upon obstacles in a cluttered terrain are available. Given a discrete set <b>of</b> plausible <b>footstep</b> locations, a forward dynamic programming approach {{is used to}} compute a footstep sequence to a specified goal location in the environment. Heuristics designed to minimize the number {{and complexity of the}} step motions are used to encode cost functions used for searching a footstep transition graph. If successful, the planner returns an optimal sequence <b>of</b> <b>footstep</b> locations according to the cost functions and plausible sets <b>of</b> <b>footstep</b> locations defined. We show results from an experimental implementation of the algorithm running on the H 7 humanoid robot. Using a stereo vision system to sense obstacles in the immediate environment and identify a target goal location, the robot updates the current optimal footstep sequence to the goal from its present location...|$|R

2500|$|Deminers may {{be issued}} {{personal}} protective equipment (PPE) such as helmets, visors, armoured gloves, vests and boots, {{in an attempt to}} protect them if a mine is set off by accident. IMAS specifies standards for such equipment but draws attention to its limitations and states that at close quarters, antipersonnel fragmentation mines and antitank mines overmatch PPE currently available. PPE can afford significant protection against antipersonnel blast mines, and these are more common. Related technologies that have been developed to improve safety include large, pillow-like pads strapped to the bottoms of shoes that distribute weight and dull the impact <b>of</b> <b>footsteps,</b> as very slight disturbances of the ground can tip off old, unstable, or intentionally sensitive mine triggers. [...] First developed in 1954 by the British as overshoes that are first inflated by the combat soldier, this specialized footwear has become a needed item for some demining operations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{landscape}} {{has been}} described as [...] "Kahn's most elegant built example of landscape planning" [...] by Philadelphia landscape architect George Patton. Approaching the main entrance past a lawn edged by pools with running water, the visitor enters a courtyard through a grove of Yaupon Holly trees. The sound <b>of</b> <b>footsteps</b> on the gravel walkway echoes from the walls {{on either side of the}} courtyard and is magnified under the curved ceiling of the entry porch. [...] After that subtle preparation, the visitor enters the hushed museum with silvery light spread across its ceiling. Harriet Pattison played the lead role in the landscape design and is also the person who suggested that open porches flanking the entrance would create a good transition from the lawn and courtyard to the galleries inside. [...] Pattison, who had also worked with Kahn on other projects, was an employee of Patton. She is the mother of film director Nathaniel Kahn, Louis Kahn's son who made the film [...] "My Architect" [...] about his father.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} new biped walking pattern {{generator}} based on “half-steps”. Its key features are a) a 3 -dimensional parametrization of the input space, and b) a simple homotopy that efficiently smooths the walking trajectory corresponding to a fixed sequence of steps. We show how these features can be ideally combined {{in the framework}} <b>of</b> sampling-based <b>footstep</b> planning. We apply our approach to the robot HRP- 2 {{and are able to}} quickly produce smooth and dynamically stable trajectories that are solutions to a difficult problem <b>of</b> <b>footstep</b> planning...|$|R

We present a footstep planner for the Honda ASIMO humanoid robot that plans a sequence <b>of</b> <b>footstep</b> positions to navigate toward a goal location while avoiding obstacles. The possible future foot placement positions are dependent on {{the current state of the}} robot. Using a finite set of state-dependent actions, we use an A* search to compute optimal sequences <b>of</b> <b>footstep</b> locations up to a time-limited planning horizon. We present experimental results demonstrating the robot navigating through both static and dynamic known environments that include obstacles moving on predictable trajectories...|$|R
2500|$|The use of {{piezoelectric}} {{materials to}} harvest power has already become popular. Piezoelectric materials {{have the ability}} to transform mechanical strain energy into electrical charge. Piezo elements are being embedded in walkways to recover the [...] "people energy" [...] <b>of</b> <b>footsteps.</b> They can also be embedded in shoes to recover [...] "walking energy". Researchers at MIT developed the first micro-scale piezoelectric energy harvester using thin film PZT in 2005. Arman Hajati and Sang-Gook Kim invented the Ultra Wide-Bandwidth micro-scale piezoelectric energy harvesting device by exploiting the nonlinear stiffness of a doubly clamped microelectromechanical systems (MEMSs) resonator. The stretching strain in a doubly clamped beam shows a nonlinear stiffness, which provides a passive feedback and results in amplitude-stiffened Duffing mode resonance. [...] Typically, piezoelectric cantilevers are adopted for the above-mentioned energy harvesting system. [...] One drawback is that the piezoelectric cantilever has gradient strain distribution, i.e., the piezoelectric transducer is not fully utilized. [...] To address this issue, triangle shaped and L-shaped cantilever are proposed for uniform strain distribution.|$|E
