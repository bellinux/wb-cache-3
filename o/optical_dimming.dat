40|$|The {{development}} of the large-scale aquatic seed production system which is provided with {{a large amount of}} natural microalgae as the initial food organisms is indispensable for the advancement of aquaculture. In the present study, a food microalgae culture system was developed and tested for the {{development of}} oyster seed production plant. To achieve an effective microalgal photosynthesis, high frequency three-band fluorescent lamps were installed {{on both sides of the}} 500 l culture tank. The luminaire has the <b>optical</b> <b>dimmer</b> function, and an average vertical side surface PPFD of 300 µmol m- 2 s- 1 was obtained on the sides of the culture tank though the luminaire was on 100 % output. A moderate optical radiant environment in the culture tank was secured by using inverter lighting method for the microalgae in culture stage, according to the optical penetration change with the growth of the microalgae population,and it succeeded in power consumption because of a great improvement in shortening the culture period and increasing the culture capacity. A daily output of 2000 l(8 x 106 cells ml- 1) microalgae can be produced in this culture system, which is composes of thirty two 500 l culture tanks. Thus an annual production capacity of 12 million oyster seedlings(shell height : 3 mm) can be achieved...|$|R

40|$|Most X-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) {{observed}} by the Swift satellite have a shallow decay phase ∝ t − 1 / 2 {{in the first}} thousands of seconds. We discuss that the shallow decay requires an unreasonably high gamma-ray efficiency, � 75 – 90 %, within current models, which is difficult to be produced by internal shocks. Such a crisis may be avoided if a weak relativistic explosion occurs ∼ 10 3 – 10 6 s prior to the main burst or if the energy fraction that goes into electrons increases during the shallow decay, ǫe ∝ t 1 / 2. The former model predicts a very long precursor while either model would prefer <b>dim</b> <b>optical</b> flashes from the reverse shock as recently reported...|$|R
40|$|We present multiwavelength {{observations}} of a gamma-ray burst detected by INTEGRAL (GRB 030227) between 5. 3 hours and ~ 1. 7 {{days after the}} event. Here we report {{the discovery of a}} <b>dim</b> <b>optical</b> afterglow (OA) {{that would not have been}} detected by many previous searches due to its faintess (R ~ 23). This OA was seen to decline following a power law decay with index αR = − 0. 95 +- 0. 16. The spectral index βopt/NIR yielded − 1. 25 +- 0. 14. These values may be explained by a relativistic expansion of a fireball (with p = 2. 0) in the cooling regime. We also find evidence for inverse Compton scattering in X-rays.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} the clustering of afterglow light curves observed at X-ray and optical wavelengths. We have constructed {{a sample of}} 61 bursts with known distance and X-ray afterglow. GRB sources can be divided in three classes, namely optical and X-ray bright afterglows, <b>optical</b> and X-ray <b>dim</b> ones, and optically bright-X-ray dim ones. We argue that this clustering {{is related to the}} fireball total energy, the external medium density, the fraction of fireball energy going in relativistic electrons and magnetic fields. We propose a method for the estimation of the GRB source redshift based on the observed X-ray flux one day after the burst and optical properties. We tested this method on three recently detected SWIFT GRBs with known redshift, and found it in good agreement with the reported distance from optical spectroscopy. ...|$|R

After combining our images into a master image, a major initial task was determining which sources were detected and identifying them with previously cataloged <b>optical</b> sources.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an active}} <b>optical</b> sensor, 3 <b>dim,</b> for capturing three-dimensional (3 D) scene structure. 3 dim {{is an active}} time-of-flight (TOF) technique, {{which is based on}} parametric modeling and processing of scene impulse responses. As opposed to estimating one depth value per pixel in a conventional TOF sensor, 3 dim operates by estimating multiple object depths at each of the baseline-separated photodetectors. 3 dim offers simple hardware construction, high frame rates, small size, insensitivity to ambient light, and low power consumption. Unlike existing depth sensors, it does not provide a depth map with full spatial resolution for general scenes, but rather high 3 D object localization accuracy in application-specific scenarios. Our 3 dim prototype is built using standard, commercially-available components. We demonstrate centimeter range resolution for gesture tracking applications on mobile platforms, a resolution that is very fine relative to the system bandwidth and optical power. Overview In the post-PC era, 3 D sensing is being increasingly integrated in consumer electronic devices to enable gesture-based user interfaces. The demand for accurate, low power and compact dept...|$|R
40|$|Since its {{launch in}} October 2002, the INTEGRAL {{observatory}} has improved {{our knowledge of}} the hard X-ray sky above 20 keV, carrying out more than ten years of observations in the energy range from 5 keV to 8 MeV. The most recently published INTEGRAL /IBIS surveys listed more than seven hundred sources in the 20 - 100 keV band. Most of these objects are either Active Galaxies (AGNs) or X-ray binaries; a fraction of both classes is made of highly absorbed sources, often associated with <b>dim</b> <b>optical</b> counterparts. Despite the big eort in the identication process, a large part of these IBIS objects (~ 25 % of them) still remains unclassied. Cross-correlation with archival catalogues and/or multiwaveband follow-up observations are of invaluable help to identify and properly classify this unknown objects, but only optical or IR spectroscopy with ground based telescopes in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere can reveal the real nature of these objects. In this work we report on source types that we nd among the unidentied objects in the most recent INTEGRAL surveys...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGRB 100418 A was an {{intermediate}} duration GRB detected by Swift. It showed an initially <b>dim</b> <b>optical</b> afterglow {{that had a}} late increase in brightness, reaching its maximum several hours after the burst onset, unlike typical afterglows that peak tens of seconds after. It also displayed a bright X-ray and radio counterpart. In this paper we present the observations of the afterglow obtained with X-shooter. Three epochs were obtained, 0. 4, 1. 4, and 2. 4 days after the burst. In these spectra, each covering the range from 3000 to 24800 Å, we detect abundant absorption features with 4 velocity components, and emission lines from the host galaxy with 2 additional velocity components. In one single velocity component, we detect a Fe II* 2396 Å fine structure feature which disappears from the first to the second epoch indicating that it {{is due to the}} effect of the GRB radiation on its environment. We consider it to be the closest absorption component to the GRB itself, for which we determine a redshift of z= 0. 6239 ± 0. 0002. From the Hα to [N II] ratio we determine a host galaxy metallicity of 0. 5 solar...|$|R
40|$|The accretion-induced {{collapse}} (AIC) of a {{white dwarf}} to a neutron star has long been suggested as a natural theoretical outcome in stellar evolution, but {{there has never been}} a direct detection of such an event. This is not surprising since the small amount of radioactive nickel synthesized (~ 10 ^(− 3) [*]M_☉) implies a relatively <b>dim</b> <b>optical</b> transient. Here we argue that a particularly strong signature of an AIC would occur for an oxygen–neon–magnesium (ONeMg) white dwarf accreting from a star that is experiencing Roche-lobe overflow as it becomes a red giant. In such cases, the ~ 10 ^(50) [*]erg explosion from the AIC collides with and shock-heats the surface of the extended companion, creating an X-ray flash lasting ~ 1 [*]hr followed by an optical signature that peaks at an absolute magnitude of ~ − 16 to − 18 and lasts for a few days to a week. These events would be especially striking in old stellar environments where hydrogen-rich supernova-like transients would not normally be expected. Although the rate of such events is not currently known, we describe observing strategies that could be utilized with high cadence surveys that should either detect these events or place strong constraints on their rates...|$|R
