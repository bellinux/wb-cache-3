50|$|An <b>oscillating</b> <b>jump</b> {{can occur}} when 2.5 < Fr1 < 4.5. During this jump, the {{jet of water}} at the {{entrance}} of the jump (supercritical) fluctuates {{from the bottom of the}} channel to the top of the channel at an irregular period. Turbulence created from this jet can be near the channel bottom at one instant and then suddenly transition to the water surface. This oscillation of the jet causes irregular waves to form, which can propagate for long distances downstream of the jump, potentially causing damage and degradation of the channel banks.|$|E
40|$|To date, smooth pursuit eye {{movement}} in schizophrenia {{has only been}} investigated using a target stimulus in continuous motion. However, smooth pursuit can also be evoked by an <b>oscillating</b> <b>jumping</b> dot {{that appears to be}} in apparent motion and although there is no continuous motion on the retinal surface this apparently moving stimulus can eVortlessly elicit smooth-pursuit {{eye movement}}. In the Wrst of two experiments smooth pursuit eye movement was evoked by target stimuli in continuous (real) motion at seven target velocities from 5. 0 to 35. 0 deg/s, and in a second experiment it was measured in response to an <b>oscillating</b> <b>jumping</b> dot in apparent motion at eight target velocities from 5. 0 to 25. 0 deg/s in a group with mixed-symptoms in schizophrenia and in a control group. The results of Experiment 1 provided no evidence for a dysfunction in continuous motion evoked smooth pursuit eye movement in the group with schizophrenia. However, following the removal of saccadic eye movements in smooth pursuit, the group with schizophrenia showed signiWcantly lower smooth pursuit eye velocity at target velocities from 20. 0 to 35. 0 deg/s. The results of Experiment 2 revealed that apparent motion evoked smooth pursuit eye velocity in the group with schizophrenia was signiWcantly lower in comparison with normal observers at all target velocities up to 25. 0 deg/s with the inclusion or exclusion of saccadic eye movements. The Wndings demonstrate that overall smooth pursuit eye movement evoked in response to a continuous (real) motion target in the group with schizophrenia may nevertheless contain a hidden temporal resolution and integration dysfunction that is revealed when smooth pursuit eye movement is evoked in response to an <b>oscillating</b> <b>jumping</b> dot in apparent motion. The Wndings also demonstrate that normal smooth pursuit eye movement in normal observers can be made to resemble the dysfunctional smooth pursuit eye movement that is naturally found in some people with schizophrenia by using a target stimulus in apparent motion...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we present}} a neutron {{scattering}} study of superionic conductivity in glassy AgI 0 5 AgPO 3 0 5 and AgI 0 33 Ag 2 S 0 33 AgPO 3 0 34 using the TOF spectrometer NEAT at BENSC, Berlin. We observe the onset of quasielastic scattering in the sub meV energy range in the doped samples below room temperature, that is absent in the undoped one. The analysis of the Q dependence of the quasielastic scattering gives the evidence that this scattering is originated from localized back and forth <b>oscillating</b> <b>jumps</b> of the Ag ions leading to the superionic conductivity within the solid glass matri...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposed}} a numerical modelling framework aiming to couple both Volume-Of-Fluid (VOF) model and MUltiple-SIze-Group (MUSIG) model {{to handle the}} formation of large-scale free surface, bubble entrainment and bubble dispersion in hydraulic <b>oscillating</b> <b>jumps.</b> To consider all essential physics, the modelling framework resolves and couples the flow structure of three different fluids (i. e. continuous air and water and dispersed air bubbles) using the Eulerian-Eulerian multi-fluid approach. To model the air entrainment at the jump toe, a sub-grid scale air entrainment model was also implemented within the framework. To evaluate the capability of the proposed model, model predictions were validated against experimental data of (Chachereau and Chanson, 2010). Comparisons between predicted and measured results are in satisfactory agreement demonstrating {{the potential of the}} proposed methodology. Discussions on the drawbacks and deficiencies of the current model are also included...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{homogenization}} of a diffusion process with jumps, that is, Feller process generated by an integro-differential operator. This problem {{is closely related}} to the problem of homogenization of boundary value problems arising in studying the behavior of heterogeneous media. Under the assumptions that the corresponding generator has vanishing drift coefficient, rapidly periodically <b>oscillating</b> diffusion and <b>jump</b> coefficients, that it admits only "small jumps" (that is, the jump kernel has finite second moment) and under certain additional regularity conditions, we prove that the homogenized process is a Brownian motion. The presented results generalize the classical and well-known results related to the homogenization of a diffusion process. Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1502. 0444...|$|R
