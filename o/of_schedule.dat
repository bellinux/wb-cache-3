40|$|This paper {{argues for}} {{reviving}} a more mechanistic view <b>of</b> CPM <b>scheduling.</b> It first reviews {{the clarity of}} displaying both the time and logic information <b>of</b> <b>schedules</b> in the graphics outputs <b>of</b> <b>scheduling</b> software used in construction practice. While such software offers an abundance of features, the true nature <b>of</b> <b>schedules</b> may remain hidden behind graphics defaults. Two methods introduced in the literature, fenced bar charts and a mechanical model, are then brought forth as examples of techniques supporting an intuitive structural understanding <b>of</b> <b>schedules.</b> Both stress the equal importance of activities and logic links for displaying schedules. Comparisons between these mechanistic methods and scheduling software are drawn and recommendations for achieving optimum graphical representations <b>of</b> <b>schedules</b> are provided. Eventually, a revised approach that acknowledges the complexity <b>of</b> <b>schedules</b> {{and the need for}} their unambiguous display can contribute to reducing errors and to an overall improved use <b>of</b> CPM <b>scheduling.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we propose a generic library <b>of</b> <b>scheduling</b> {{problem-solving}} methods. As a first approximation, scheduling {{can be defined}} as an assignment of jobs and activities to resources and time ranges in accordance with a number of constraints and requirements. In some cases optimisation criteria may also be included in the problem specification. Although, several attempts {{have been made in the}} past at developing the libraries <b>of</b> <b>scheduling</b> problem-solvers, these only provide limited coverage. Many lack generality, as they subscribe to a particular scheduling domain. Others simply implement a particular problem-solving technique, which may be applicable only to a subset of the space <b>of</b> <b>scheduling</b> problems. In addition, most of these libraries fail to provide the required degree of depth and precision, which is needed both to obtain a formal account <b>of</b> <b>scheduling</b> problem solving and to provide effective support for development <b>of</b> <b>scheduling</b> applications by reuse. Our library subscribes to the Task-Method-Domain-Application (TMDA) knowledge modelling framework, which provides a structured organisation for the different components of the library. In line with the organisation proposed by TMDA, we first developed a generic scheduling task ontology, which formalises the space <b>of</b> <b>scheduling</b> problems independently <b>of</b> any particular application domain, or problem solving method. Then we constructed a task-specific, but domain independent model <b>of</b> <b>scheduling</b> problem-solving, which generalises from the variety <b>of</b> approaches to <b>scheduling</b> problem-solving, which can be found in literature. The generic nature of this model was demonstrated by constructing seven methods for scheduling, as alternative specialisation of the model. Finally, we validated our library on a number of applications to demonstrate its generic nature and effective support for the analysis and development <b>of</b> <b>scheduling</b> applications. i To the memories of my father [...] ...|$|R
