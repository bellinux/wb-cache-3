50|$|<b>Oilfish</b> is pleasantly rich in {{taste and}} can be {{substantially}} cheaper than some other fish species, leading to some fish sellers intentionally mislabelling it as butterfish or even codfish, despite the utter lack of relation. This leads the consumer to often eat large servings, as they assume it is a fish {{with which they are}} familiar, and then some may experience a laxative effect. Because of this, Japan and Italy have imposed an import ban on <b>oilfish.</b> Australia does not ban <b>oilfish</b> from being sold but recommends retailers and caterers to inform consumers about the potential risk associated with <b>oilfish</b> consumption. The US FDA has warned consumers about potential mislabeling of <b>oilfish,</b> but has concluded any laxative side effects that occur are uncomfortable at worst and pose no health risk. Escolar, a relative of <b>oilfish,</b> also has high concentrations of wax esters and is mislabeled similarly.|$|R
40|$|Large, mesopelagic teleost fishes have a {{potentially}} keystone {{position in the}} ecology of the pelagic water column, yet remain relatively unstudied when compared with large, commercially important, epipelagic fishes. Here, the ecological roles of four, large, vertically migrating teleosts were examined. Stomach content analyses were performed on 48 <b>oilfish</b> (Ruvettus pretiosis), 35 escolar (Lepidocybium flavobrunneum), 32 snake mackerel (Gempylus serpens) and seven lancetfish (Alepisaurus spp.) collected from pelagic longline gear in the Western North Atlantic Ocean from 2007 to 2010. Of these specimens, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses were also performed on white dorsal muscle tissue from 33 <b>oilfish,</b> 16 escolar, 27 snake mackerel and seven lancetfish. Based on literature length-at-maturity values, all escolar, snake mackerel and lancetfish specimens were mature, while 13 of the 33 <b>oilfish</b> were juveniles. Crustaceans, annelids, salps, cephalopods and teleosts were present in the stomachs and were presumed to be prey items. A Kruskal–Wallis test showed the four species to be isotopically segregated in both δ 13 C and δ 15 N. Escolar were the most depleted in δ 13 C, followed by adult <b>oilfish,</b> juvenile <b>oilfish</b> and lancetfish, with snake mackerel the most enriched. The depletion in δ 13 C of adult <b>oilfish</b> and escolar may have been attributable to high C/N values, which were strongly correlated with length in <b>oilfish,</b> weakly correlated with length in escolar and moderately correlated with length in snake mackerel and lancetfish. The high C/N was likely due to the high lipid concentration of these fishes. Other factors that {{may have contributed to the}} depletion in δ 13 C may include spawning or a change in carbon source within the ecosystem. Large escolar occupied the highest trophic level (δ 15 N = 10. 20), followed by snake mackerel (δ 15 N = 9. 66), adult <b>oilfish</b> (δ 15 N = 9. 32), lancetfish (δ 15 N = 9. 05) and juvenile <b>oilfish</b> (δ 15 N = 7. 83).

50|$|Currently, {{the major}} threat towards the {{coelacanth}} is the accidental capture by fishing operations. Coelacanths usually are caught when local fishermen are fishing for <b>oilfish.</b> Fishermen sometimes snag a coelacanth {{instead of an}} <b>oilfish</b> because they traditionally fish at night, when <b>oilfish</b> (and coelacanths) feed.Before scientists became interested in coelacanths, they were thrown {{back into the water}} if caught. Now that there is an interest in them, fishermen trade them in to scientists or other officials once they have been caught. Before the 1980s, this was a problem for coelacanth populations. In the 1980s, international aid gave fiberglass boats to the local fishermen, which resulted in fishing beyond the coelacanth territories into more fish-productive waters. Since then, most of the motors on the boats have broken down so the local fishermen are now back in the coelacanth territory, putting the species at risk again.|$|R
40|$|Stomach content {{analysis}} and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis used in combination {{can provide a}} robust analysis of the diet and ecological role of organisms not possible for either technique used alone. This combined analysis methodology was applied to four mesopelagic teleost fishes (snake mackerel Gempylus serpens, lancetfish Alepisaurus spp., <b>oilfish</b> Ruvettus pretiosus, and escolar Lepidocybium flavobrunneum) collected from the South Atlantic Bight and Gulf of Mexico {{over a period of}} two years. These species are diel vertical migrators and the differences in the diets of these organisms is presently unknown. However, understanding their trophic role within the pelagic ecosystem is vital for on-going pelagic fisheries ecosystem modeling. Combined stomach content and stable isotope analyses were performed on these fishes and compared with species, length, weight, sex, location, and maturity. The results from the stomach content analyses show snake mackerel as having the most diverse diet and escolar having the least diverse diet.

Orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) is an attractive food fish with 5,5% fat, where 90% of the fat comes as wax esters.

The results of morphological study and quantitative analysis of functionally active mitochondria in cells of the olfactory epithelium of closely related deep-water fish species with different modes of life provide evidence that tolerance of the olfactory apparatus to hypobaric hypoxia is different in pelagic and benthic species.

Presently, 29 species of fishes and two invertebrates are fished (along {{with a group of}} species reported as "non-identified"), primarily from the 10 main fishing grounds within 5 nm from the shore. Sporadic fishing trips reach areas up to 25 nm offshore. Statistics about the artisan fleet and number of operative fishers is spotty and unreliable.
