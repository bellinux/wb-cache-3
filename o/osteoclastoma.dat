40|$|Calcitonin {{inhibits}} both osteoclast {{formation and}} bone resorption, {{and is a}} primary treatment for patients with hypercalcemia and increased bone turnover. However, the clinical utility of calcitonin is limited because patients become refractory to calcitonin after several days (the calcitonin "escape phenomenon"). The molecular basis for calcitonin "escape" is unclear. To determine the regulatory mechanisms controlling calcitonin receptor (CTR) expression in osteoclasts and their precursors, we treated immature mononuclear precursors for human osteoclast-like multinucleated cells (MNC) formed in vitro with 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3, to induce their differentiation to committed mononuclear precursors, and mature multinucleated osteoclasts, and used reverse transcriptase (RT) -PCR to assess expression of CTR mRNA in both committed mononuclear precursors and MNC. The PCR fragment produced was cloned and sequenced to confirm that it was derived from CTR mRNA. CTR mRNA expression was detected in mononuclear MNC precursors after 7 d of 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 treatment. It was also present in osteoclast-like MNC and highly purified giant cells from <b>osteoclastomas,</b> but not in monocytes or macrophage polykaryons formed in vitro. Calcitonin markedly decreased CTR but not actin mRNA expression in giant cells and MNC after 12 h, and removal of calcitonin restored CTR mRNA expression. Similarly, calcitonin decreased calcitonin-induced adenylate cyclase activity. These data suggest: (a) downregulation of CTR gene expression by calcitonin may in part explain the calcitonin "escape phenomenon"; and (b) expression of CTR mRNA occurs in mononuclear osteoclast precursors within 7 d after exposure to 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which primary tumors of the bone cause bone destruction have not been elucidated. Unlike most other lytic bone tumors, <b>osteoclastomas,</b> otherwise known as giant cell tumors (GCT), contain osteoclast-like cells within the tumor stroma. A new member of the TNF-ligand superfamily member, osteoclast differentiation factor (ODF/OPGL/RANKL/TRANCE), was recently identified. ODF was shown to directly stimulate osteoclastogenesis, {{in the presence of}} M-CSF. In this study, the expression of ODF was examined in a number of tumor samples associated with bone lysis in vivo. In addition, we investigated expression of the ODF receptor on osteoclast precursors, RANK, as well as the ODF inhibitor osteoprotegerin (OPG), and another TNF-ligand superfamily member, TRAIL, previously shown to abrogate the inhibitory effects of OPG. We report here the novel finding that GCT stromal cells contain abundant ODF mRNA, whereas the giant cell population exclusively expresses RANK mRNA. These results are consistent with the osteoclast-mediated bone destruction by these tumors. We also report the expression of OPG and TRAIL mRNA in GCT samples. A comparison with other lytic and nonlytic tumors of bone showed that GCT express more ODF and TRAIL mRNA relative to OPG mRNA. In addition, GCT were found to express a number of cytokines previously reported to play central roles in osteoclastogenesis, namely, IL- 1, - 6, - 11, - 17, as well as TNF-alpha. Importantly, GCT were also found to express high levels of M-CSF mRNA, a cytokine shown to be an essential cofactor of ODF, and a survival factor for mature and developing osteoclasts. Furthermore, expression of these molecules by stromal cells isolated from GCT continued in vitro. Thus GCT constitutively express all of the signals that are currently understood to be necessary for the differentiation of osteoclasts from precursor cells...|$|R

The purification over the original tumour extract was about 2000 -fold, with a yield of 10 %. The enzyme appeared to be homogeneous when assessed by SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Both gel filtration and SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis indicated an Mr of about 30, 000. The reduced and alkylated enzyme consists of two subunits with Mrs of 15, 000 and 17, 500.

40|$|Owing to {{striking}} {{features of}} numerous multinucleated cells and bone destruction, giant cell tumor (GCT) of bone, often called as <b>osteoclastoma,</b> has drawn major attractions from orthopaedic surgeons, pathologists, and radiologists. The name GCT or <b>osteoclastoma</b> gives a false {{impression of a}} tumor comprising of proliferating osteoclasts or osteoclast precursors. The underlying mechanisms for excessive osteoclastogenesis are intriguing and GCT has served as an exciting disease model representing a paradigm of osteoclastogenesis for bone biologists. The modern interpretation of GCT is predominantly osteoclastogenic stromal cell tumors of mesenchymal origin. A diverse array of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines disrupts osteoblastic differentiation and promotes the formation of excessive multi-nucleated osteoclastic cells. Pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines such as receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), interleukin (IL) - 6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) as well as monocyte-recruiting chemokines such as stromal cell-derived factor- 1 (SDF- 1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) - 1 participate in unfavorable osteoclastogenesis and bone destruction. This model represents a self-sufficient osteoclastogenic paracrine loop in a localized area. Consistent with this paradigm, a recombinant RANK-Fc protein and bisphosphonates are currently being tried for GCT treatment in addition to surgical excision and conventional topical adjuvant therapies...|$|E
40|$|Many {{apparently}} promising {{lines of}} work in orthopaedic radiology have proved disappointing.

HO 57 is represented by three species of mRNA of 1. 6, 2. 6 and 2. 8 kb and is expressed at low levels {{in a range of}} human tissues, but at significantly higher levels in brain, kidney and <b>osteoclastoma,</b> and is probably an ubiquitously expressed isoform.

40|$|Osteoclastomata {{arise in}} the metaphyses of long bones, but when there is fusion of epiphyses the tumours may extend {{as far as the}} {{articular}} cartilage. They occur also in the bones of the face, skull and spine. In the skull, the tumour follows the distribution of cartilaginous centres of ossification and this has been held to support the view that it is attributable to “ persisting developmental processes occurring in pre-cartilaginous and pre-osseous connective tissues “ (Geschickter and Copeland 1931). Willis (1948) considered that osteoclasts, osteoblasts, fibroblasts and chondroblasts were intermutable and that enzyme changes probably determined the function, and therefore the histological appearances, of the cells. Geschickter and Copeland said that “ in <b>osteoclastoma</b> and osteitis fibrosa giant cells can be seen on the outside of new blood vessels and vascular spaces, showing that the giant cells in these lesions retain the same histological function as the osteoclasts seen in human and other mammalian embryos. ” They suggested that there was a growth of blood vessels with osteoclasts from the marrow towards part of the cortex, the blood supply of which had suffered in some cases from trauma; and that an <b>osteoclastoma</b> might result from persistence of the excess of of osteoclasts.

SB 242784 completely prevented retinoid-induced hypercalcemia in thyroparathyroidectomized (TPTX) rats when administered orally at 10 mg/kg. SB 242784 was highly efficacious {{in the prevention}} of ovariectomy-induced bone loss in the rat when administered orally for 6 months at 10 mg/kg/d and was partially effective at 5 mg/kg/d. Its activity was demonstrated by measurement of bone mineral density (BMD), biochemical markers of bone resorption, and histomorphometry. SB 242784 was at least as effective in preventing bone loss as an optimal dose of estrogen. There were no adverse effects of compound administration and no effects on kidney function or urinary acidity. Selectivity of the inhibitor was further studied using an in situ cytochemical assay for bafilomycin-sensitive V-H+-ATPase using sections of <b>osteoclastoma</b> and numerous other tissues. SB 242784 inhibited the osteoclast enzyme at 1, 000 -fold lower concentrations than enzymes in any of the other tissues evaluated. SB 242784 demonstrates the utility of selective inhibition of the osteoclast V-H+-ATPase as a novel approach to the prevention of bone loss in humans...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To review {{cases of}} giant cell tumour of bone or <b>osteoclastoma</b> managed at the University Malaya Medical Center, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, from January 1990 to December 1999. METHODS: Medical records of all {{patients}} with musculoskeletal tumours were reviewed. Demographic data, clinical presentation, surgical management, and clinical outcomes were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Most of the 31 {{patients who were}} treated for giant cell tumour of bone presented late {{on the basis of}} the duration of their symptoms and radiological features. Five of the patients had been referred for local recurrences. 26 patients were treated for primary tumours: 18 needed wide excision, 7 curettage, and one amputation. The joint could not be preserved and arthrodesis was performed for 11 patients. Three (12 %) of the 26 patients had local recurrence during a mean follow-up of 60 months, including one (6 %) who had recurrence after wide excision and 2 (29 %) after curettage. Pulmonary metastasis was noted in 4 cases, 2 of which were confirmed histologically. CONCLUSION: Even in an advanced stage of disease, good clinical outcomes can be achieved with adequate excision and appropriate reconstruction. For lesions around the knee, autologous rotational grafting is a good alternative method of reconstruction...|$|E
