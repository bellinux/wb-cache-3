5000|$|Maclura tinctoria, the <b>old</b> <b>fustic,</b> {{a medium}} to large tree species found from Mexico to Argentina ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Old</b> <b>fustic</b> {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with young fustic (Rhus cotinus) from southern Europe and Asia, which provides a more fugitive colour.|$|E
5000|$|Maclura tinctoria, {{commonly}} known as <b>old</b> <b>fustic</b> or dyer's mulberry [...] is a medium to large tree of the Neotropics, from Mexico to Argentina. It produces a yellow dye called fustic primarily known for coloring khaki fabric for U.S. military apparel during World War I. This dye contains the flavonoid morin.|$|E
5000|$|Morin is {{a yellow}} {{chemical}} compound {{that can be}} isolated from Maclura pomifera (Osage orange), Maclura tinctoria (<b>old</b> <b>fustic)</b> and from leaves of Psidium guajava (common guava). In a preclinical in vitro study, morin {{was found to be}} a weak inhibitor of fatty acid synthase with an IC50 of 2.33 μM. [...] Morin was also found to inhibit amyloid formation by islet amyloid polypeptide (or amylin) and disaggregate amyloid fibers.|$|E
30|$|The {{presence}} of copper {{in relation to}} green textiles where morin was identified matches historical information that points {{to the use of}} copper mordants with <b>old</b> <b>fustic</b> to create olive tones [64]. Morin was identified on samples from patterns 367, 368, 370 and 377, which indeed points to the use of <b>old</b> <b>fustic,</b> a ‘New World’ dyestuff. Besides morin, we also identified quercetin in pattern 377, which strongly suggests a compound recipe.|$|E
30|$|In {{contrast}} {{to most of}} the yellow-coloured samples, the one from pattern 447 showed morin, suggesting the use of <b>old</b> <b>fustic</b> (Maclura tinctoria), a strong yellow dye originally found in Central and South America and the Caribbean [32]. We were able to do SEM–EDX on this sample by carbon-coating the textile fibre. False colour maps (Fig.  3) show the presence of aluminium, calcium and potassium, strongly suggesting <b>old</b> <b>fustic</b> mordanted wool using calcium tartar possibly mixed with alum. Ponting notes yellows could be obtained using <b>old</b> <b>fustic,</b> aluminium and tin, although the resulting colours were not light fast [39]. Given the light sensitivity of flavonols such as morin, the vibrancy of the yellow hues in the pattern book examined gives additional weight to the view that the textile swatches have been rarely exposed to ultraviolet radiation [23, 29].|$|E
30|$|XRF {{revealed}} pattern 442 is copper- (and not iron-) rich; no yellow {{components were}} identified, albeit indigotin was present. Perhaps the yellow components’ concentration {{fell out of}} the instrument’s detection limits, but given the trend we observed, it seems reasonable to associate this green 442 with <b>old</b> <b>fustic</b> greens.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an analytical procedure based on GC-MS to identify in textiles {{the most common}} flavonoid yellow dyes used in Europe since ancient times, extracted from weld, young fustic, dyer's broom, sawwort and the berries of some species of Rhamnus. Later on, <b>old</b> <b>fustic</b> and quercitron bark were introduced as sources of yellow colours. The method {{is based on the}} solvent extraction of flavonoids from raw plant materials (weld, dyer's broom and <b>old</b> <b>fustic),</b> aged and not aged alum-mordanted wool dyed specimens; subsequently, flavonoids are derivatised with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide and analysed by GC-MS. The method easily allows the identification of a dyestuff by the detection of the molecular markers apigenin, luteolin, genistein, morin, maclurin, together with 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid, 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid, 2, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid, 2, 4, 6 - trihydroxybenzoic acid, which survive in aged textiles. Two photo-oxidative degradation pathways for colour fading, one involving the mordant metallic ion and the other the light as a catalyst, are suggeste...|$|E
30|$|Natural {{flavonoid}} compounds {{were detected}} in sample P. 9, containing {{as the main}} components 3, 4 -dihyxroxybenzoic acid, morin and maclurin, molecular markers of <b>old</b> <b>fustic,</b> and traces of rhamnetin and emodin, molecular markers of buckthorn berries. Interestingly, the jar containing the powdered samples was labelled as “Stil de grain Brun employable surfin”, which is usually obtained by treating unripe buckthorn berries [40]. Thus, a mixture of different natural sources can be hypothesised {{for the production of}} this material.|$|E
30|$|We limited {{our case}} study to 47 out of 685 samples for ethical considerations, {{and used a}} {{combination}} of spectroscopic, microscopic and chromatographic techniques to identify dyes and infer the presence of mordants. In conjunction with archival research, these scientific results were successfully cross-referenced with documentary sources. Weld, young and <b>old</b> <b>fustic,</b> quercitron, cochineal, madder, indigo plants and orchil dyes were all found in the samples (weft) in repetitive combinations that suggested well-defined recipes. In turn, these results advanced {{our knowledge of the}} substances used to produce primary and compound colours. Furthermore, we found scientific evidence that points the presence of a water-soluble glaze material, likely a natural gum.|$|E
30|$|Newspaper {{advertisements}} recorded {{about two-thirds}} of the number of available dyestuffs indicated by Edmonds (some used as mordants as well): Spanish annatto, red sulphuret of arsenic (orpiment), indigo (East India, Spanish and paste), chemic (indigo in sulphuric acid), lac spirits (possibly Indian or other lac extract), madder, munjeet (Bengal madder), plum spirits (logwood mixed with tin mordant), citron bark (quercitron), safflower, woad, turmeric, sumac (Sicily and Malaga), the wood dyes barwood or camwood (African sandalwood), <b>old</b> <b>fustic,</b> logwood, peach wood and sanders (red sandalwood) [26, 27]. It was anticipated that the historical and experimental evidence would inform each other, thereby enhance, and expand our understanding of the dyestuffs used in Norwich to produce primary—reds, yellows, blues—and compound colours [7].|$|E
30|$|Lichen {{components}} {{related to}} orcein {{were identified in}} all purple-coloured samples except in patterns 374 and 439 where no dye components were detected. Samples from patterns 4, 435, 437, and 446 also contain indigotin, present in indigo plants or woad. In addition, possibly due to cross contamination, the sample from pattern 435 contained traces of morin, present in <b>old</b> <b>fustic.</b> Since we confirmed the presence of morin in numerous green samples, we believe its presence in purple 435 may {{be a result of}} contamination by handling of the pattern book after manufacture (for example, the yellow in pattern 447 on the same page contains morin). Finding indigo and/or lichen components, such as orcein was expected: during the eighteenth century English dyers obtained their purples either by using blue and red dyes like indigo and madder, or from less colourfast lichens.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: {{the purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} whether natural dyes facilitate posterior hyaloid detachment (posterior vitreous detachment [PVD]) and retinal internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling in human eyes. Methods: Open-sky vitrectomy with posterior hyaloid and ILM removal was performed in 86 human cadaveric eyes. After core vitrectomy, 11 different dyes were injected into the vitreous cavity to aid hyaloid detachment and ILM removal. the dyes were allowed to settle on the macula for 5 minutes after PVD and were removed by mechanical aspiration. Intraocular forceps were used for ILM peeling, which was confirmed by light microscopy of the peeled tissue. Acai fruit (Euterpe oleracea) extract and 10 additional dyes from plants or animal sources were tested: pomegranate (Punica granatum), logwood (Haematoxylum campechianum), chlorophyll extract from alfalfa (Medicago sativa), cochineal (Dactylopius coccus), hibiscus (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis), indigo (Indigofera tinctoria), paprika (Capiscum annuum), turmeric (Curcuma longa), <b>old</b> <b>fustic</b> (Maclura tinctoria), and grape (Vitis vinifera). Results: the dyes facilitated PVD and ILM peeling. Acai fruit (E. oleracea) extract, logwood (H. campechianum), cochineal (D. coccus), and <b>old</b> <b>fustic</b> (M. tinctoria) facilitated PVD in all cases; dye-assisted PVD was compared with triamcinolone-assisted PVD performed previously in a comparative model. Acai fruit (E. oleracea) extract, cochineal (D. coccus), and chlorophyll extract from alfalfa (M. sativa) showed the best capability for ILM staining; dye-assisted ILM removal was compared with the ILM peeling guided by indocyanine green staining performed previously in a comparative model. Light microscopy confirmed the ILM removal in all cases. Conclusion: Anthocyanin dye of the acai fruit (E. oleracea) and the dyes from cochineal (D. coccus) and chlorophyll extract from alfalfa (M. sativa) resulted in the best capability for posterior hyaloid and ILM staining in human cadaveric eyes and may be a useful tool for vitreoretinal surgery.

40|$|The goal of {{the study}} is to compare the dyes used in ecclesiastical post-Byzantine (sixteenth to early twentieth century) {{textiles}} of Mount Athos, Greece, with the corresponding organic colourants used in Ottoman (16 th – 18 th c.) [Σ 1] textiles which are preserved in the Topkapi Palace Museum, Istanbul, Turkey. During the historical period of interest, Mount Athos, which has been the spiritual centre of Byzantine culture for centuries, was within the borders of the Ottoman Empire (period of Ottoman rule) and Constantinople was its capital. The comparison of the colouring materials that have been used during the period of the Ottoman rule in textiles from the two different, Byzantine and Ottoman, cultures is of great interest. Samples extracted from forty-six and fifty post-Byzantine and Ottoman textiles respectively, were analysed using high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC–DAD). The analysis of a silk velvet (inventory no: 13 / 1679, Topkapi Palace Museum), is presented in detail and serves as an example to describe the methodology that was applied throughout the investigation. More similarities than differences are observed in the results reported for the two textile collections of different cultural identity. The following materials were found in both post-Byzantine and Ottoman textiles: cochineal, madder (Rubia tinctorum L.), lac (Kerria lacca, Kerr), young fustic (Cotinus coggygria Scop.), weld (Reseda luteola L.), dyer’s broom (Genista tinctoria L.), buckthorn berries (Rhamnus trees), indigoid dyes, either indigo (Indigofera species and others) or woad (Isatis tinctoria L.) and tannins. On the other hand, soluble redwood (Caesalpinia trees), <b>old</b> <b>fustic</b> (Chlorophora tinctoria L.) and logwood (Haematoxylum campechianum L.) were found only in post-Byzantine textiles while dyer’s chamomile (Anthemis species) and Rumex species were detected only in few objects from the Topkapi Palace Museum...|$|E
30|$|During {{this initial}} stage {{of an ongoing}} {{research}} project, we have also made progress {{in one of our}} main goals: contributing to the understanding of these materials as an avenue to ensuring their preservation. While destructive analysis such as HPLC–PDA–MS is often conclusive and commonly used to assess collections, it is not sustainable in a museum or archival environment, where instrumental analysis is often limited, if available at all. By studying dated and well-preserved textiles, such as those presented in our case study, we are providing evidence that we anticipate will help in the management and care of collections. For instance, the presence of light sensitive dyes such as flavonoid- containing yellow and green (quercitron, weld, young and <b>old</b> <b>fustic),</b> and especially purple (orchil) textiles, needs to be taken into consideration when deciding display and storage conditions where light levels should be kept at their lowest. Our findings showed J. Tuthill & Sons dyers used recipes/combinations consistently and repetitively. This poses a question of whether the lack of recipe books is indeed due to the ‘secrecy’ Mellor and Cardwell suggest [5], or if it is related to the ‘slow start of publications’ that Kirby, et. al. attribute to the English wool having been dyed for so long in Flanders and Holland [69]. Because of the consistent and repetitive use of combinations, certain colours and patterns likely contain a dye combination, which can be translated into informed guesses of the presence of certain chromophores therein. These informed guesses, in turn, could allow for collections’ assessment {{even in the absence of}} scientific dye analysis. Further, the presence of what seems to be water-sensitive materials such as a gum used for surface glazing imposes the need for stable and mid-level relative humidity conditions, to avoid either the drying or softening of the coating. In presenting our earliest results, we trust our findings can contribute to the care of these beautiful and important textiles in both swatch form and in costumes and furnishing collections.|$|E
