5|$|An {{alternative}} video surfaced {{online in}} late May 2010, explaining why Beyoncé's character was remembering her love {{interest in the}} <b>original</b> <b>version.</b> It begins {{with a view of}} the night sky and many trees, as Beyoncé drives a car and Ealy's character is chased by the police through a forest. As the video progresses, she parks her car on the side of the road and scenes from the <b>original</b> <b>version</b> are shown. Police dogs eventually catch Ealy's character and attack him savagely. An open bag reveals stolen money, which is dispersed by the wind. At the end of the video, in the forest, Beyoncé finds Ealy lying lifelessly on the ground.|$|E

5|$|The {{inclusion}} of a television in the <b>original</b> <b>version</b> would have surprised many readers. The BBC had only introduced television to Britain in the late 1930s (suspended entirely until 1946) and Belgium would not have television until 1955.|$|E
5|$|This {{movement}} {{was not part}} of Rossini's <b>original</b> <b>version</b> for two pianos and harmonium, but he inserted it in his version for orchestra. He transposed an earlier composition. It became customary to include it even in performances and editions with piano(s).|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of Uyarndha Manithan, AVM Productions was keen to remake it in Hindi and {{approached}} Dilip Kumar. After watching the film, Kumar was hesitant to play the lead role as he felt he would not match Ganesan's performance in the <b>original</b> <b>version.</b> K. Balachander was signed {{up to be the}} director of the remake, which led to Kumar being initially convinced that he could be successful.|$|E
5|$|Another {{narrative}} on the constellations, three paragraphs long, {{is from a}} Latin writer whose brief notes {{have come}} down to us {{under the name of}} Hyginus. It begins with the oxhide story of Orion's birth, which this source ascribes to Callimachus and Aristomachus, and sets the location at Thebes or Chios. Hyginus has two versions. In one of them he omits Poseidon; a modern critic suggests this is the <b>original</b> <b>version.</b>|$|E

5|$|Captain Archibald Haddock (Capitaine Haddock in Hergé's <b>original</b> <b>version)</b> is a Merchant Marine sea {{captain and}} Tintin's best friend. Introduced in The Crab with the Golden Claws, Haddock is {{initially}} {{depicted as a}} weak and alcoholic character, but later evolves to become genuinely heroic and even a socialite after he finds a treasure from his ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock (Chevalier François de Hadoque in the <b>original</b> <b>version).</b> The Captain's coarse humanity and sarcasm act as a counterpoint to Tintin's often-implausible heroism; he is always quick with a dry comment whenever the boy reporter seems too idealistic. After he and Tintin find Red Rackham's treasure, Captain Haddock lives in the luxurious mansion Marlinspike Hall (Le château de Moulinsart in the original French).|$|E
5|$|Due to the show's {{habit of}} repeating cliffhanger footage, {{sometimes}} missing episode material {{can be found}} in surviving neighbor episodes. Episode 2 of The Daleks uses a prefilmed reprise from the original recording of Episode 1, which later had to be remounted; the <b>original</b> <b>version</b> of Episode 1 is presumed to have been destroyed.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, a very {{different}} version of the film was released; much of the live-action sequences were replaced by animation, and dialogue was heavily rewritten and reedited. It was given a limited release in the United States and went largely unnoticed; it performed respectably in foreign markets, and developed a cult following. The <b>original</b> <b>version</b> of the film remains unreleased.|$|E
