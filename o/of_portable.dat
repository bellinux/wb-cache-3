The application of the spiral balance spring for watches ushered {{in a new era}} of accuracy for portable timekeepers, similar to that which the pendulum had introduced for clocks. From its invention in 1675 by Christiaan Huygens, the spiral hairspring (balance spring) system for portable timekeepers, still used in mechanical watchmaking industry today.|$|E

5|$|Production of the No. 20 resumed around 1947, {{at which}} time the company began to license the Oliver name to several European {{manufacturing}} companies. The standard desktop machine was eventually discontinued in favor <b>of</b> <b>portable</b> models; the company began to sell a German design, the Siemag Standard, as the Oliver standard. In 1958, Oliver purchased the Byron Typewriter Company, previously the Barlock Typewriter Company, of Nottingham. The licensing ventures were ultimately unsuccessful, and the company's machine tools were transferred to a factory in Germany. Production of all Oliver typewriters ended in May 1959.|$|E
5|$|The micro {{format is}} the most durable {{from the point of}} view of {{designed}} insertion lifetime. The standard and mini connectors have a design lifetime of 1,500 insertion-removal cycles, the improved Mini-B connectors increased this to 5,000. The micro connectors were designed with frequent charging <b>of</b> <b>portable</b> devices in mind, so have a design life of 10,000 cycles and also place the flexible contacts, which wear out sooner, on the easily replaced cable, while the more durable rigid contacts are located in the receptacles. Likewise, the springy component of the retention mechanism, parts that provide required gripping force, were also moved into plugs on the cable side.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{unveiled}} the PowerBook100 on October 21, 1991, at the Comdex computer expo in Las Vegas, {{with two other}} models, the PowerBook 140 and PowerBook 170. The advertisement and the product were both successful. Apple projected US sales of more than 200,000 PowerBooks in the first year, with peak demand {{in the first three}} months of release. By January 1992, Apple had sold more than 100,000 PowerBooks, by which time they were in short supply. Apple soon solved the supply problems, and the proceeds from PowerBook sales reached $1billion in the first year after launch. Apple surpassed Toshiba and Compaq as the market leader in worldwide share <b>of</b> <b>portable</b> computer shipments. The PowerBook100, 140, and 170 contributed greatly to Apple's financial success in 1992. At the end of the financial year, Apple announced its highest figures yet, $7.1billion in revenues and an increase in global market share from 8% to 8.5%, the highest it had been in four years.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, many colleges and school districts across Florida remained closed. President George W. Bush declared all of Florida a federal disaster area. Kennedy Space Center did not restore its complete work force until September 13 due to relief operations, as well as a lack of gasoline, ice, and water in the area. A total of 8000 members of the National Guard helped out with recovery efforts soon after the storm left the Florida peninsula. Residents in the areas of impact after the storm were under a boil water order, {{because of the lack of}} electricity to area water systems. Churches prepared meals for those without power and food themselves. Federal employees were granted excused absences if they helped with law enforcement and the cleanup. Thousands <b>of</b> <b>portable</b> generators were sent to the state by Home Depot and Lowe's home improvement stores. The United States Army Corps of Engineers installed blue tarpaulins on 41,556 damaged roofs statewide. Damage to the Florida citrus crop caused orange futures to rise four cents a pound due to Frances.|$|E
5|$|The main site, {{known as}} H1, was {{established}} on Hermite Island. This was {{the location of}} the control room from which the bomb would be detonated, along with the equipment to monitor the firing circuits and telemetry. It was also {{the location of the}} generators that provided electric power, and recharged the batteries <b>of</b> <b>portable</b> devices, and ultra-high-speed cameras operating at up to 8,000 frames per second. Other camera equipment was set up on Alpha Island and Northwest Island. Most of the monitoring equipment was positioned on Trimouille Island, closer to the explosion. Here, there were a plethora of blast, pressure and seismographic gauges. There were also some 200 empty petrol tins for measuring the blast, a technique that Penney had employed on Operation Crossroads. There were thermometers and calorimeters for measuring the flash, and samples of paints and fabrics for determining the effect on them. Plants would be studied to measure their uptake of fission products, particularly radioactive iodine and strontium. Stores were unloaded at beachhead H2 on Hermite Island, from whence the RAAF had built a road to H1. A stores compound was established at Gladstone Beach on Trimouille Island, known as T3.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} type is the live bootleg, or {{audience}} recording, which is created with sound recording equipment smuggled into a live concert. Many artists and live venues prohibit this form of recording, but from the 1970s onwards the increased availability <b>of</b> <b>portable</b> technology made such bootlegging easier, and the general quality of these recordings has improved over time as consumer equipment becomes sophisticated. A number of bootlegs originated with FM radio broadcasts of live or previously recorded live performances. Other bootlegs may be soundboard recordings taken directly from a multi-track mixing console used to feed the public address system at a live performance. Artists may record their own shows for private review, but engineers may surreptitiously take a copy of this, which ends up being shared. As a soundboard recording is intended to supplement the natural acoustics of a gig, a bootleg may have an inappropriate mix of instruments, unless the gig is so large that everything needs to be amplified {{and sent to the}} desk.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years there has been rapid growth in the demand for mobile {{communications}} that has led to intensive research and development of complex PCS (personal communication service) networks. Capacity planning and performance modeling are necessary to maintain a high quality of service to the PCS subscriber while minimizing costs. Effective and practical performance models for large-scale PCS networks are currently available. Two new performance models are presented in this paper which can be solved using analytical techniques. The first model is the so-called the portable population model which is based on the the flow equivalent assumption (the rate <b>of</b> <b>portables</b> into a cell equals the rate <b>of</b> <b>portables</b> move out <b>of</b> the cell).

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the main findings of the Pupils' Learning and Access to Information Technology (PLAIT) project, a project designed to investigate the impact <b>of</b> using <b>portable</b> computers on pupils' learning. The research was undertaken in nine schools with 235 pupils each having full-time ownership <b>of</b> a personal <b>portable</b> computer over one school year. The evaluation involved quantitative and qualitative methods and the findings are reported under two main headings: the potential <b>of</b> <b>portables</b> for enhancing learning and issues related to operationalizing their use. The results suggest that U. K. curriculum design encourages separation of process-based learning from content-based learning and is militating against the potential for information technology to impact on pupils' learning...|$|R
