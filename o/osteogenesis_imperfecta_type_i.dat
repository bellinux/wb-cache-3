40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to achieve more detailed information regarding the age and sequence {{in the development of}} motor milestones in the different <b>types</b> of <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> (OI). The parents of 98 patients with a diagnosis of OI were sent a questionnaire regarding the age at which patients achieved motor milestones. All patients were attending the outpatient clinic for children with OI at the Wilhelmina Children's Hospital. The motor milestones were classified into static motor milestones and dynamic motor milestones and all data were checked with health care records. The age of development of motor milestones was compared to reference values of the healthy population. The severity of the disease was classified according to Sillence based on clinical, genetic and radiological data. The age of intramedullary redding of the first nail in the lower and upper extremity and the localisation was noted. A total of 76 parents responded to the 98 questionnaires (78 %). In OI <b>type</b> <b>I,</b> a delay exists in achieving motor milestones, comparable to the 95 th percentile of the normal population. In type III, the development of all motor milestones was significantly delayed compared to <b>types</b> <b>I</b> and IV with a discrepancy between static and dynamic milestones. In OI type IV, a retardation in motor development developed after the milestone 'sitting without support' was achieved. Motor development in <b>types</b> <b>I</b> and IV was not influenced by intramedullary redding of the lower extremities, since redding was rarely performed before the milestone 'unsupported standing' was achieved. In type III, the influence of intramedullary redding on the age of achieving motor milestones remains questionable. Conclusion The severity of <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> has a large influence on the age and sequence in the development of motor milestones. No influence of intramedullary redding of the lower extremities on motor development was found in <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> <b>types</b> <b>I</b> and IV, whereas the influence in type III remains questionable...|$|R

40|$|<b>Osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> (OI) <b>type</b> <b>I</b> is the mildest form of {{heritable}} bone fragility {{resulting from}} mutations within the COL 1 A 1 gene. We studied fibroblasts established {{from a child}} with OI <b>type</b> <b>I</b> and demonstrated underproduction of alpha 1 (I) collagen chains and alpha 1 (I) mRNA. Indirect RNase protection suggested two species of alpha 1 (I) mRNA, {{one of which was}} not collinear with fully spliced alpha 1 (I) mRNA. The noncollinear population was confined to the nuclear compartment of the cell, and contained the entire sequence of intron 26 and a G [...] >A transition in the first position of the intron donor site. The G [...] >A transition was also identified in the genomic DNA. The retained intron contained an in-frame stop codon and introduced an out-of-frame insertion within the collagen mRNA producing stop codons downstream of the insertion. These changes probably account for the failure of the mutant RNA to appear in the cytoplasm. Unlike other splice site mutations within collagen mRNA that resulted in exon skipping and a truncated but inframe RNA transcript, this mutation did not result in production of a defective collagen pro alpha 1 (I) chain.

40|$|Dermal {{fibroblasts}} {{from most}} individuals with <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> (OI) <b>type</b> <b>I</b> produce {{about half the}} normal amount of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> procollagen, {{as a result of}} decreased synthesis of one of its constituent chains, pro alpha 1 (I). To test the hypothesis that decreased synthesis of pro alpha (I) chains results from mutations in the COL 1 A 1 gene, we used primer extension with nucleotide-specific chain termination to measure the contribution of individual COL 1 A 1 alleles to the mRNA pool in fibroblasts from affected individuals. A polymorphic MnlI restriction endonuclease site in the 3 '-untranslated region of COL 1 A 1 was used to distinguish the transcripts of the two alleles in heterozygous individuals. Twenty-three individuals from 21 unrelated families were studied. In each case there was marked diminution in steady-state mRNA levels from one COL 1 A 1 allele. Loss of an allele through deletion or rearrangement was not the cause of the diminished COL 1 A 1 mRNA levels. Primer extension with nucleotide-specific chain termination allows identification of the mutant COL 1 A 1 allele in cell strains that are heterozygous for an expressed polymorphism. It is applicable to sporadic cases, to small families, and to large families in whom key individuals are uninformative at the polymorphic sites used in linkage analysis, making it a useful adjunct to the biochemical screening of collagenous proteins for OI...|$|R

Natural collagen is a fibrous protein with challenging properties, such as solubility, {{which makes it}} difficult to study through analytical methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Collagen mimetic peptides are a flexible and controlled model system that imitates natural <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen structure, a triple helix, on a smaller scale, from over 1000 amino acids to around 30 amino acids. Chapter one will explore the development of collagen mimetic peptides and review the current design principle to form composition and register specific triple helices. Chapter two will illustrate the power of charge pairing in the triple helix with the creation of a triple helix with an extended offset through axial charge pairing. This is the first triple helix with an extended offset, proving that the offset triple helix is possible, even when it is not incorporated into a fiber. Chapters three and four will model mutations from <b>Osteogenesis</b> <b>Imperfecta,</b> a <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen disease, in collagen mimetic peptides. <b>Osteogenesis</b> <b>Imperfecta</b> results from mutations of the requisite glycines in the Xaa-Yaa-Gly repeat of collagen.

The results of those experiments will be used to create molecular models of the mutated triple helices. This series of studies gives insight into the forces in the triple helix: the destabilizing force of a mutation, the stabilizing force of hydrogen bonds, and the stabilizing, yet constricting, force of axial charge pairs. In these model systems, the mutation was able to direct the composition and register of the triple helix, where the triple helix with the lowest number of mutations would fold, even if it is not the most stabilized via charge pairing...|$|R

Assay of thermal {{stability of the}} triple helix by proteinase digestion demonstrated a decreased temperature for thermal unfolding of the protein. Of special importance was the observation that assays of thermal stability by proteinase digestion revealed two bands present in a 2 : 1 ratio of about 140 and 70 kDa; the 140 kDa band was reducible to a 70 kDa band. Further analysis of the fragments demonstrated that the cysteine mutation produced a local unfolding of the triple helix around residue 700 and apparently exposed the arginine residue at position 704 in both the alpha 1 (I) and alpha 2 (I) chains. Analysis of cDNAs and genomic DNAs demonstrated a single-base mutation that changed the GGT codon for glycine- 691 of the alpha 1 (I) chain to a TGT codon for cysteine.

For vertebral fracture diagnosis, plain radiographs were used as "gold standard" and VFA and morphometric X-ray absorptiometry (MXA) were performed. The visualized vertebrae were 738 (97. 9 %) by radiographs and 685 (90. 9 %) by DXA of a total of 754 vertebrae from T 4 to L 4. VFA and MXA identified, respectively, 129 (74 %) and 116 (66 %) of the 175 vertebral fractures detected by radiographs. Radiographs identified 36 patients with vertebral fractures, VFA 35 and MXA 41 (6 false positives). On a per vertebra basis, radiographs and VFA had elevated agreement (93. 9 %; k score 0. 81, 95 % CI 0. 76 - 0. 86), that resulted slightly lower for MXA (90. 6 %; k score 0. 72, 95 % CI 0. 65 - 0. 78). VFA and MXA demonstrated high sensitivity (95. 6 and 94. 1 %, respectively) while specificity was 100 % for VFA and 90. 6 % for MXA on a per patient basis; the agreement was excellent for VFA (98. 3 %; k score 0. 96, 95 % CI 0. 89 - 1. 03) and good for MXA (87. 9 %; k score 0. 73, 95 % CI 0. 55 - 0. 91). The diagnostic performance parameters resulted better for VFA (sensitivity 95. 6 %; specificity 100 %; PPV 100 %; NPV 97. 2 %), than for MXA (sensitivity 94. 1 %; specificity 85. 4 %; PPV 72. 7 %; NPV 97. 2 %). The results of our study demonstrate the reliability of VFA for diagnosis of vertebral fractures in children with OI suggesting its use as a more safe and practical alternative to conventional radiography...|$|R
40|$|To {{identify}} a molecular genetic cause {{in patients with}} a clinical diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type I/IV. The authors performed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis of the COL 1 A 1 gene {{in a group of}} 106 index patients. In four families with mild osteogenesis imperfecta and no other phenotypic abnormalities, a deletion of the complete COL 1 A 1 gene on one allele was detected, a molecular finding that to our knowledge has not been described before, apart from a larger chromosomal deletion detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization encompassing the COL 1 A 1 gene in a patient with mild osteogenesis imperfecta and other phenotypic abnormalities. Microarray analysis in three of the four families showed that it did not concern a founder mutation. The clinical picture of complete COL 1 A 1 allele deletions is a comparatively mild type of osteogenesis imperfecta. As such, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis of the COL 1 A 1 gene is a useful additional approach to defining the mutation in cases of suspected <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> with no detectable mutatio...|$|E

40|$|Standing height, sitting height, armspan, subischial leg length, head circumference, {{and growth}} hormone-insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) axis were {{determined}} in 86 patients with osteogenesis imperfecta. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine standing height and body proportions and their variability among osteogenesis imperfecta types and collagen defects. Mean standing height was reduced in all groups of patients, to the greatest extent and variability in osteogenesis imperfecta type III/IV and in those with qualitative collagen defects. The mean standing height of patients with osteogenesis imperfecta was lower than that of their unaffected first degree family members. Truncal height of patients with osteogenesis imperfecta was reduced; head size was increased, and this was more pronounced in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta type III/IV and qualitative collagen defects than in patients with <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> and quantitative collagen defects. Mean concentrations of IGF-I and IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP- 3) were low, but most values were within age specific reference values. The reduction of standing height appears to correlate with osteogenesis imperfecta type and the type of collagen defect. A relatively short trunk is typical and head circumference and body length are disproportionate. ...|$|E
