He has said that he created a 'fairy tale quality' to the film in which the audience can sympathize with all of the people featured in it. He stated that [...] "I wanted to populate this film with a lot of faces and give each character their <b>own</b> <b>moment</b> of grace, even when, on the surface, it's one of the 'bad guys,' so to speak...

The lead track on Bartoks Crisis, “The Romanians”, a German-English-Croatian-French rock epic, is one that they rarely play live, because the middle part contains a rock piano concerto that Philippe can only play on a Bösendorfer grand piano, and such pianos are only seldom to be seen on a rock stage.|$|E

While episodes like this can often be meh, this one wasn’t, simply because the information that we did get was so juicy and the acting was rock solid across the board.

Yet in present day network societies this task is particularly urgent. This paper first identifies two positions that tend to monopolize and deadlock debates. Next it examines two decades {{of research in the}} Large Technical System (LTS) research field for alternative approaches to this issue, before finally suggesting distinguishing between the four increasingly indirect moments of (co-) construction of infrastructures and societies. These may be related causally, but also add their <b>own</b> <b>moments</b> of contingency, agency, and choice...|$|R

Anders pulls a gun but Leoben says if he dies, Starbuck's dream dies with him and explains there won't be a resurrection this time. Leoben informs him of the war among the Cylons, between those who embrace their nature and those who fear it. He proposes an alliance between his faction and the fleet. The hybrid can lead Starbuck to righteousness and together they can find the promised land. Anders scoffs at the notion and leaves.|$|E
50|$|Game one {{featured}} {{the first ever}} Golden point decision in State of Origin football {{in the very first}} game where the ruling became available. With scores locked at 8-all and three minutes of extra time played, St George Illawarra Dragons player Shaun Timmins, who had returned to top-class and representative football against unlikely odds after two career-threatening knee injuries and operations, stepped up and kicked a 37-metre left-foot field goal to steal victory for New South Wales. Blues halfback Craig Gower had already missed three earlier field goal attempts, was struggling with a knee injury and was closely marked by Queensland at every kick opportunity so it was left to Timmins to create his <b>own</b> <b>moment</b> of Origin folklore.|$|E

50|$|The most {{important}} Peloponnesian city after Sparta was Argos. The two chief men, Aristippus and Aristeas, were keen rivals. As Aristippus was {{an ally of}} Antigonus, Aristeas invited Pyrrhus to come to Argos to help him take over the city. Antigonus, aware that Pyrrhus was advancing on Argos, marched his army there as well, taking up a strong position on some high ground near the city. When Pyrrhus learned this, he encamped about Nauplia {{and the next day}} dispatched a herald to Antigonus, calling him a coward and challenging him to come down and fight on the plain. Antigonus replied that he would choose his <b>own</b> <b>moment</b> to fight and that if Pyrrhus was weary of life, he could find many ways to die.|$|E
50|$|Other {{precedents}} from America’s newspaper supplements were occasional experiments by Frank King in his Gasoline Alley Sunday pages {{where he}} would turn the whole page into one continuous landscape. For example, on 24 May 1931, King uses an unrealistic, almost isometric perspective to turn the page into a single image, like a diagram viewed from above, of the neighborhood and its assorted residents. This angled aerial view he divides into 12 equal panels, each containing at least one fresh character to contribute their <b>own</b> <b>moment</b> of comedy. In more of an ensemble of jokes than a strictly linear narrative, no characters appear here more than once. King went further, however, in 1934 when over three consecutive weeks he used the whole page as one image to portray a house being built, from bare site to construction to finishing touches. The first of these, dated 25 March 1934, presents repeated images of Skeezix and his pal Whimpy as they play around the foundations dug out of their favorite baseball diamond and meet a local girl. Here the threesome move around 12 identical square panels and time unfolds in sequence, although jumping ahead sometimes by a considerable period {{from one to the}} next.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his writings on marine life, Ricketts wrote three philosophical essays; he continued to revise them over the years, integrating new ideas in response to feedback from Campbell, Miller, and other friends. The first essay lays out his idea of [...] "nonteleological thinking" [...] a way of viewing things as they are, rather than seeking explanations for them. In his second essay, [...] "The Spiritual Morphology of Poetry," [...] he proposed four progressive classes of poetry, from naive to transcendent, and assigned famous poets from Keats to Whitman to these categories. The third essay, [...] "The Philosophy of 'Breaking Through'," [...] explores transcendence throughout the arts and describes his <b>own</b> <b>moments</b> of 'breaking through', such as his first hearing of Madame Butterfly.|$|R

40|$|This essay {{describes}} a classroom role-playing activity that incorporates both modern social {{media and the}} tools of eighteenth-century composition.

Furthermore, it can illuminate {{the ways in which the}} medium influences not only the message, but also the messenger, thus revealing potentially surprising connections between material modes of communication, embodied behavior, and intellectual output. ...|$|E
