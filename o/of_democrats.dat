5|$|In an {{interview}} with GQ ahead of the Michigan primary in February 2012, McCotter expressed concern that Republicans were underestimating the strength <b>of</b> <b>Democrats,</b> and that winning in the Midwest would be difficult because of the Republicans' position on manufacturing and the Wall Street bailout. He maintained that though he disagreed with Romney on the auto industry bailout, Romney had {{the best chance to}} overcome the obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{elements}} were popular {{across the political}} spectrum, while others, such as the mandate to purchase insurance, were widely disliked. In a 2012 poll 44% supported the law, with 56% against. By party affiliation, 75% <b>of</b> <b>Democrats,</b> 27% of Independents and 14% of Republicans favored the law overall. 82% favored banning insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, 61% favored allowing children to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26, 72% supported requiring companies with more than 50 employees to provide insurance for their employees, and 39% supported the individual mandate to own insurance or pay a penalty. By party affiliation, 19% of Republicans, 27% of Independents, and 59% <b>of</b> <b>Democrats</b> favored the mandate. Other polls showed additional provisions receiving majority support, including the creation of insurance exchanges, pooling small businesses and the uninsured with other consumers so that more people {{can take advantage of}} large group pricing benefits and providing subsidies to individuals and families to make health insurance more affordable.|$|E

5|$|When the 38th Congress {{convened in}} December 1863, the Civil War was {{approaching}} its end. Randall was a War Democrat, sometimes siding with his Republican colleagues to support measures {{in pursuit of}} victory over the Confederates. When a bill was proposed to allow President Abraham Lincoln to promote Ulysses S. Grant to lieutenant general, Randall voted in favor, unlike most in his party. He voted with the majority <b>of</b> <b>Democrats,</b> however, to oppose allowing black men {{to serve in the}} Union Army.|$|E
5|$|From 1820 to 1850, Jacksonian {{democracy}} began a set {{of reforms}} which included wider white male suffrage; {{it led to the}} rise of the Second Party System <b>of</b> <b>Democrats</b> and Whigs as the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854. The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that resettled Indians into the west on Indian reservations. The U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist Manifest destiny. The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest. Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest.|$|E

5|$|Lamont won {{the primary}} with 51.79 {{percent of the}} vote as opposed to Lieberman's 48.21 percent; it was the only Senate race in 2006 where an {{incumbent}} lost re-nomination. In his concession speech, Lieberman announced that he would stand by his prior statements that he'd run as an independent if he lost the Democratic primary. Lieberman won the general election with approximately 50 {{percent of the vote}}; exit polls showed that Lieberman won the vote of 33 percent <b>of</b> <b>Democrats,</b> 54 percent of independents, and 70 percent of Republicans.|$|E
5|$|There {{were four}} Saxbe fixes for appointees of presidents prior to Barack Obama. The first two rollbacks {{concerned}} appointees of Republicans William Howard Taft and Richard Nixon, {{and the last}} two were implemented for appointees <b>of</b> <b>Democrats</b> Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. Congress approved two more in the weeks preceding Obama's presidency in preparation for his designated Cabinet nominees. Since the 1980s, Saxbe fixes have only been temporary, extending to {{the conclusion of the}} term for which the sitting member of Congress was elected. The Clause has received relatively little scholarly or judicial attention; the sparse extant debate centers on whether the reduction of salary satisfies the Ineligibility Clause, or whether affected members of Congress are ineligible for appointment in spite of the reduction.|$|E
5|$|After the gubernatorial {{election}} in 1999, Louisville senator Dan Seum {{announced he would}} change his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, citing his conservative voting history, including opposition to the state lottery, KERA, and abortion. This switch, which Patton learned of too late to intervene, equalized the number <b>of</b> <b>Democrats</b> and Republicans in the Senate. Six weeks later, Paducah senator Bob Leeper announced he would also change his party affiliation. Patton traveled to Paducah and met with Leeper, {{but was unable to}} convince him to remain a Democrat. Leeper had a history of conflict with Democratic Senate President Larry Saunders, but he insisted his party switch, like Seum's, was based on political philosophy. Leeper's switch gave Republicans a majority in the Senate {{for the first time in}} the state's history. David Williams was elected President of the Senate, and held the Republican majority together effectively. Consequently, Patton faced a difficult task in maneuvering his agenda through a divided General Assembly.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{majority}} of those advocating a name change are Democrats, {{there is no indication that}} the issue is of any real significance in electoral decisions given that Native Americans are such a small percentage of the electorate and are not likely to influence the outcome of any election. There are only eight states where Natives make up greater than 2 percent of the population: Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming. However, polls show a definite political difference in the opinion of the general public, with only 58% <b>of</b> <b>Democrats</b> opposing a name change versus 89% of Republicans. Statements by political figures have generally been expressions of personal opinion rather than recommendations for government action. There have also been non-binding resolutions advocating name change proposed in New Jersey and passed in Minneapolis, New York State and California.|$|E
5|$|By 1824, New Hampshire was {{a hotbed}} of partisanship, with figures such as Woodbury and Isaac Hill {{laying the groundwork for}} a party <b>of</b> <b>Democrats</b> in support of General Andrew Jackson. They opposed the {{established}} Federalists (and their successors, the National Republicans), who were led by sitting President John Quincy Adams. The work of the New Hampshire Democratic Party came to fruition in March 1827, when their pro-Jackson nominee, Benjamin Pierce, won the support of the pro-Adams faction and was elected governor of New Hampshire essentially unopposed. While the younger Pierce had set out to build a career as an attorney, he was fully drawn into the realm of politics as the 1828 presidential election between Adams and Jackson approached. In the state elections held in March 1828, the Adams faction withdrew their support of Benjamin Pierce, voting him out of office, but Franklin Pierce won his first election: Hillsborough town moderator, a position to which he would be elected for six consecutive years.|$|E
5|$|Clinton joined friend Bruce Lindsey's Little Rock {{law firm}} of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings. In 1982, he was elected {{governor}} a second time and kept the office for ten years. Effective with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years. During his term, he helped transform Arkansas's economy and improved the state's educational system. For senior citizens, he removed the sales tax from medications and increased the home property-tax exemption. He became a leading figure among the New Democrats, a group <b>of</b> <b>Democrats</b> who advocated welfare reform, smaller government, and other policies not supported by liberals. Formally organized as the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the New Democrats argued that in light of President Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1984, the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to succeed at the national level. Clinton delivered the Democratic response to Reagan's 1985 State of the Union Address and served {{as chair of the}} National Governors Association from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.|$|E

5|$|For all {{the claims}} about the {{potential}} for violence, election day, November 7, remained mostly calm across the state. Fewer than a dozen people were arrested statewide. Voting returns were slow, and on election night, the race was still too close to call. When the official tally was announced, Taylor had won by a vote of 193,714 to 191,331. Former governor John Y. Brown, nominated by a dissident group <b>of</b> <b>Democrats,</b> had garnered 12,040 votes, and Populist candidate John G. Blair had captured 2,936. Though the Board of Elections was thought to be controlled by Goebel, it rendered a surprise 2–1 decision to certify the election results. The board's majority opinion claimed {{that they did not have}} any judicial power and were thus unable to hear proof or swear witnesses, leaving them without grounds to invalidate any votes. Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Gravel was {{challenged}} for the Democratic Party's nomination by State Representative Clark Gruening, {{the grandson of}} the man Gravel had defeated in a primary 12 years earlier. Several factors made Gravel vulnerable. As an insurgent candidate in 1968, Gravel had never established a firm party base. Not liking to hunt or fish, he was also always culturally suspect in the state. A group <b>of</b> <b>Democrats,</b> including future governor Steve Cowper, led the campaign against Gravel, with Gravel's actions in respect to the 1978 and 1980 Alaskan lands bills a major issue, especially given that the latter's dénouement happened but {{a week before the}} primary. The sources of Gravel's campaign funds, some of which came from political action committees outside the state, also became an issue in the contest. Another factor may have been Alaska's blanket primary system of the time, which allowed unlimited voting across party lines and from its many independents; Republicans believed Gruening would be an easier candidate to defeat in the general election.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer {{found himself}} {{at odds with}} the Democratic {{organization}} on some occasions, most prominently on amendments to the city charter. In 1956, charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections were proposed. Sawyer had campaigned against the idea and refused to go along with them. Even without his support, the amendments found the required two-thirds vote in Council to make it on to the ballot for popular approval. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down some of the amendments, and the rest failed in a referendum that April. Such disagreements led the Democratic City Committee to withhold their endorsement of Sawyer for a second term in 1959, and he retired from elected office to return to his law practice. In 1965, while serving as president of the southeastern Pennsylvania chapter of the Americans for Democratic Action, Sawyer led a group <b>of</b> <b>Democrats</b> who endorsed Republican Arlen Specter for district attorney of Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|Willis {{faced the}} {{challenge}} of having Democratic majorities {{in both houses of}} the General Assembly and strong Democratic leadership in each. In the House, Democrats held a 56–44 majority, and Harry Lee Waterfield served as Speaker of the House. In the Senate, Democrats held a 23–15 majority, and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate was Earle C. Clements. Both Waterfield and Clements were preparing to make gubernatorial runs in 1947. Willis did not make wholesale dismissals <b>of</b> <b>Democrats</b> in the state government, owing in part to shortages of experienced people during the war. This cost him some Republican support, and both his lieutenant governor and attorney general began to oppose him on many matters. However, his refusal to make wholesale dismissals may have been responsible the legislature not stripping the bulk of his gubernatorial powers as it had done to Flem D. Sampson, the last Republican governor.|$|E
