25|$|A {{commemorative}} inscription to {{mark the}} remodelling works on the castle, incised into granite that integrates a coat of arms, <b>oval</b> <b>frame</b> and gargoyles, over {{the door of the}} parade grounds, with the modern epigram O QUARTO CONDE DA FEIRA DOM DIOGO FORJAZ MANDOU FAZER ESTA E O RELÓGIO DAQUELA TORRE NA ERA DE 1562 (The 4th Count of Feira Dom Diogo Forjaz ordered this and the clock of that tower in the era of 1562).|$|E
500|$|Between 1907 and 1916, Sinn Féin, {{one of the}} {{nationalist}} organisations of the time, issued propaganda labels symbolising Irish nationhood. Their use as stamps was forbidden by Post Office regulations. The first design was a Celtic Cross, similar to one later adopted for two definitive stamps of 1923, and the second depicts a female figure and harp in an <b>oval</b> <b>frame.</b> In 1912, labels inscribed [...] "Imperial Union" [...] appeared, with a design of a larger harp and female figure. These labels, expressing unionist sentiments, {{are believed to have}} been printed in Manchester as a counter to the Sinn Féin labels. After the Home Rule Bill for Ireland was passed in parliament, an Irish Republican body issued labels in 1916 with the portraits of three nationalist heroes known as The Manchester Martyrs against an Irish tricolour background. Forgeries of these labels are common. Following the Easter Rising of 1916, American sympathisers printed eight ERIE PUIST labels showing portraits of seven prominent leaders and a harp and shamrock label. The misspelling ERIE for ÉIRE could have been because of hasty preparation.|$|E
50|$|While most mats are {{generally}} rectangular in shape, with a rectangular opening, {{in addition to}} fairly common oval, oval-apertured mats designed to go with <b>oval</b> <b>frames,</b> there are also very unusual examples of mats in other shapes.|$|R

2500|$|Johnson painted many {{portraits of}} {{emerging}} new English gentry.

60|$|So {{every day}} the little trail had some new {{surprise}} for you,--owl, or hare, or prickly porcupine rattling his quills, like a quiver of arrows, and proclaiming his Indian name, Unk-wunk! Unk-wunk! as he loafed along. When you had followed far, and were sure that the loitering trail had certainly lost itself, it crept at last under a dark hemlock; and there, through an <b>oval</b> <b>frame</b> of rustling, whispering green, was the loneliest, loveliest little deer-haunted beaver pond in the world, where Quoskh lived with his mate and his little ones.|$|E
60|$|Two portraits {{were hanging}} there--one {{that of a}} young man of the good old times, smiling with red lips and brown eyes, a pastel in an <b>oval</b> <b>frame.</b> Another {{medallion}} held the portrait of his wife, gay, piquante, in a bodice with ribbons fluttering, and with a bird perched on her finger. It was the old aunt in her youth, and further search discovered her ancient festal-gown, of stiff brocade. Sylvie arrayed herself in this splendour; patches were found in a box of tarnished gold, a fan, a necklace of amber.|$|E

50|$|Picture {{frames are}} {{generally}} square or rectangular, though circular and <b>oval</b> <b>frames</b> are not uncommon. Frames in more unusual shapes such as football shapes, stars, hearts can be hand carved {{by a professional}} wood carver or carpenter. There are also picture frames designed to go around corners. A popular design is the scoop, an indent in the frame adding depth.|$|R

60|$|The {{first time}} I {{came down the}} trail and peeked through the <b>oval</b> <b>frame</b> of bushes, I saw him; and the very first glimpse made me jump {{at the thought of}} what a {{wonderful}} discovery I had made, namely, that little herons play with dolls, as children do. But I was mistaken. Quoskh had been catching frogs and hiding them, one by one, as I came along. He heard me before I knew he was there, and jumped for his last frog, a big fat one, with which he slanted up heavily on broad vans--with a hump on his back and a crook in his neck and his long legs trailing below and behind--towards his nest in the hemlock, beyond the beaver pond. When I saw him plainly he was just crossing the <b>oval</b> <b>frame</b> through which I looked. He had gripped the frog across the middle in his long beak, much as one would hold it with a pair of blunt shears, swelling it out at either side, like a string tied tight about a pillow. The head and short arms were forced up at one side, the limp legs dangled down on the other, looking {{for all the world like}} a stuffed rag doll that Quoskh was carrying home for his babies to play with.|$|E
60|$|Jack assented; a {{few paces}} farther {{brought them to the}} corner of a narrow street, where they {{presently}} turned into a broader thoroughfare and stopped before the window of a photographer. Sophy pointed to an <b>oval</b> <b>frame,</b> containing a portrait painted on porcelain. Mr. Hamlin was startled. Inexperienced as he was, a certain artistic inclination told him it was good, although it is to be feared he would have been astonished even if it had been worse. The mere fact that this headstrong country girl, who had run away with a cur like Stratton, {{should be able to do}} anything else took him by surprise.|$|E
60|$|One morning, about eleven, Dorothea {{was seated}} in her boudoir with {{a map of the}} land {{attached}} to the manor and other papers before her, which were to help her in making an exact statement for herself of her income and affairs. She had not yet applied herself to her work, but was seated with her hands folded on her lap, looking out along the avenue of limes to the distant fields. Every leaf was at rest in the sunshine, the familiar scene was changeless, and seemed to represent the prospect of her life, full of motiveless ease--motiveless, if her own energy could not seek out reasons for ardent action. The widow's cap of those times made an <b>oval</b> <b>frame</b> for the face, and had a crown standing up; the dress was an experiment in the utmost laying on of crape; but this heavy solemnity of clothing made her face look all the younger, with its recovered bloom, and the sweet, inquiring candor of her eyes.|$|E

60|$|Before Hunilla's eyes they sank. The real woe of {{this event}} passed before her sight as some sham tragedy on the stage. She was seated on a rude bower among the {{withered}} thickets, crowning a lofty cliff, a little back from the beach. The thickets were so disposed, that in looking upon the sea at large she peered out from among the branches as from the lattice of a high balcony. But upon the day we speak of here, the better to watch the adventure of those two hearts she loved, Hunilla had withdrawn the branches to one side, and held them so. They formed an <b>oval</b> <b>frame,</b> through which the bluely boundless sea rolled like a painted one. And there, the invisible painter painted to her view the wave-tossed and disjointed raft, its once level logs slantingly upheaved, as raking masts, and the four struggling arms indistinguishable among them; and then all subsided into smooth-flowing creamy waters, slowly drifting the splintered wreck; while first and last, no sound of any sort was heard. Death in a silent picture; a dream of the eye; such vanishing shapes as the mirage shows.|$|E
60|$|In {{the cabinet}} of the Essex Historical Society, old portraits.--Governor Leverett; a dark mustachioed face, the figure two-thirds length, clothed {{in a sort}} of frock-coat, buttoned, and a broad {{sword-belt}} girded round the waist, and fastened with a large steel buckle; the hilt of the sword steel,--altogether very striking. Sir William Pepperell, in English regimentals, coat, waistcoat, and breeches, all of red broadcloth, richly gold-embroidered; he holds a general's truncheon in his right hand, and extends the left towards the batteries erected against Louisbourg, in the country near which he is standing. Endicott, Pyncheon, and others, in scarlet robes, bands, etc. Half a dozen or more family portraits of the Olivers, some in plain dresses brown, crimson, or claret; others with gorgeous gold-embroidered waistcoats, descending almost to the knees, so as to form the most conspicuous article of dress. Ladies, with lace ruffles, the painting of which, in one of the pictures, cost five guineas. Peter Oliver, who was crazy, used to fight with these family pictures in the old Mansion House; and the face and breast of one lady bear cuts and stabs inflicted by him. Miniatures in oil, with the paint peeling off, of stern, old, yellow faces. Oliver Cromwell, apparently an old picture, half length, or one third, in an <b>oval</b> <b>frame,</b> probably painted for some New England partisan. Some pictures that had been partly obliterated by scrubbing with sand. The dresses, embroidery, laces of the Oliver family are generally better done than the faces. Governor Leverett's gloves,--the glove part of coarse leather, but round the wrist a deep, three or four inch border of spangles and silver embroidery. Old drinking-glasses, with tall stalks. A black glass bottle, stamped with the name of Philip English, with a broad bottom. The baby-linen, etc., of Governor Bradford of Plymouth County. Old manuscript sermons, some written in short-hand, others in a hand that seems learnt from print.|$|E

2500|$|Johnson's early portraits were panel {{paintings}} with [...] "fictive" [...] <b>oval</b> <b>frames</b> – {{they appear}} to have a wooden or marble oval surround, but this is actually painted on to the panel.

40|$|Clay’s "Untitled" {{series is}} an {{installation}} comprising three photographs illuminated in light boxes, two small <b>framed</b> <b>oval</b> images of photography and text, and black vinyl text installed at intervals across the gallery walls and spaced between the photographs. While the installation includes photography it nevertheless refers to painting. The composition, color and {{subject of the}} illuminated photographs recall Jacques-Louis David’s portrait of Juliette Récamier. Unlike Madame Récamier, the woman in Clay’s photographs, who is the artist herself, denies the viewer her gaze: her back and head are turned, and then {{she gets up and}} exits the frame. The images in the <b>oval</b> <b>frames</b> are similarly elusive by being fragmentary. Correspondingly, the wall text does not explain the photos and instead signals dreaming, daily life, and poetic reverie. Photographic clarity and meaning in language, especially in the gallery context, yield to private, inner experience.  ...|$|R
