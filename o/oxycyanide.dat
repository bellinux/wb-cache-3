40|$|Background: Although cyanide {{poisoning}} can {{be serious}} or fatal, it is typically described as mild when the cyanide is ingested {{in the form}} of either mercuric cyanide or mercury <b>oxycyanide.</b> Methods: We studied two patients with acute cyanide poisoning following ingestion of one of these two agents in each case. Results: Both patients demonstrated features of life-threatening cyanide poisoning, including hemodynamic instability, severe lactic acidosis, and high blood cyanide concentration. One of the patients died, while the second demonstrated signs of mercury intoxication (acute renal failure and severe gastrointestinal symptoms), in addition to cyanide intoxication. Conclusion: Ingestion of either mercuric cyanide or mercury <b>oxycyanide</b> can result in life-threatening cyanide intoxication...|$|E
40|$|Case report: A 53 -year old {{pharmacist}} {{is admitted}} to hospital after poisoning with a magistral formulation containing mercuric <b>oxycyanide.</b> The initial treatment {{consists of the}} administration of hydroxocobalamine and dimercaprol (BAL), followed by a blood purifying treatment, hemodialysis, then dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and hemoperfusion. Material and methods: Mercury is quantified using cold vapor - atomic absorption spectrometry (CV-AAS) in blood and ICP-MS in urine. The mercury concentrations, determined in blood and urine 24 hours after ingestion were respectively 3087 $mu$g/L (reference value < 5 $mu$g/L) and 9573 $mu$g/g creatinin (reference value < 3 $mu$g/g). Mercury was quantified in blood and urine during 52 days of hospitalisation to follow its excretion and treatments efficiency. A mercury quantification is carried out using ICP-MS on two locks of hair collected two months after ingestion. Hair specimen (6 cm) was cut into six equal lengths. Results and discussion: Mercury concentrations range from 4. 6 to 41. 2 ng/mg (reference value < 1 ng/mg). These high concentrations {{could be explained by}} a contamination of the hair by sebum...|$|E
