5|$|The League and {{the ideas}} of {{collective}} security {{and the rule of}} law were defeated; partly because of indifference and of sympathy with the aggressor, but partly because the League powers were unprepared, preoccupied with <b>other</b> <b>matters,</b> and too slow to perceive the scale of Japanese ambitions.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{differences}} on <b>other</b> <b>matters,</b> discussed at length in Carl von Clausewitz's {{study of the}} Campaign of 1815 and Wellington's famous 1842 essay in reply to it, the Prussian Clausewitz agreed with Wellington on this assessment. Indeed, Clausewitz viewed the battle prior to the Prussian intervention more as a mutually exhausting stalemate than as an impending French victory, with the advantage, if any, leaning towards Wellington.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Luxembourg {{was allowed}} to retain its own {{government}} and political system, but all proceedings were overshadowed by the German army's presence. Despite the overbearing distraction of the occupation, the Luxembourgish people attempted to lead their lives as normally as possible. The political parties attempted to focus on <b>other</b> <b>matters,</b> such as the economy, education, and constitutional reform.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1913 Installation it was {{necessary}} to adapt the chapel to accommodate the larger number of members.

5|$|Sergeant's {{books and}} David Lawson's Paul Morphy The Pride and Sorrow of Chess (New York, 1976) make {{extensive}} use of Edge's book, but note Edge's strong anti-Staunton bias. Lawson also suggests that Morphy had seen the manuscript of Edge's book, disliked its treatment of the Staunton affair {{so much that he}} disavowed it, and objected to Edge's treatment of <b>other</b> <b>matters.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several <b>other</b> <b>matters</b> {{were also}} raised, {{relating}} to particular {{parts of the}} evidence (specifically, relating to the witness testimony of Yahya Goba, one of the Buffalo Six), but these matters had little bearing on the final outcome of the case, and were dealt with only briefly by the court. The central argument raised was that, with regard to all the circumstances, Thomas did not actually have a practical choice whether to speak or not.|$|E

5|$|Surviving {{sources for}} Medieval Scotland {{are much more}} limited than for {{contemporaneous}} England. The only burgh for which there are sources pre-dating 1400 is Aberdeen. The only large body of sources to survive from before 1400 are the cartularies of monasteries.

5|$|Another committee, led by Oddvar Halvorsen, was {{established}} in 1960 {{to look at the}} matter again. Also it recommended a tunnel and a central station. However, it felt that the tunnel should be longer and intersect with the Drammen Line at a point between Skarpsno and Skøyen, and build a second station at Frogner. The proposal was presented to the Parliament of Norway on 4 November 1961, along with several <b>other</b> <b>matters</b> related to rail transport investments. Construction of the Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station was passed unanimously.|$|E
5|$|Donnchadh's {{career is}} not well {{documented}} in the surviving sources. Charters provide a little information about some of his activities, but overall their usefulness is limited; this is because no charter-collections (called cartularies) from the Gaelic south-west have survived the Middle Ages, and the only surviving charters relevant to Donnchadh's career come from the heavily Normanised English-speaking area to the east. Principally, the relevant charters record his acts of patronage towards religious houses, but incidental details mentioned {{in the body of}} these texts and the witness lists subscribed to them are useful for <b>other</b> <b>matters.</b>|$|E
5|$|Foliot {{attended}} the Second Lateran Council, called by Pope Innocent II.

Matilda was the daughter and only surviving legitimate child of King Henry I, but following her father's death in late 1135 her cousin Stephen, the son of Henry's sister, had seized the crown. By 1139 Matilda had gathered supporters and was contesting Stephen's right to the throne.|$|E

5|$|Gregory also {{instructed}} Augustine on <b>other</b> <b>matters.</b> Temples {{were to be}} consecrated for Christian use, and feasts, if possible, {{moved to}} days celebrating Christian martyrs. One religious site was revealed to be a shrine of a local St Sixtus, whose worshippers were unaware of details of the martyr's life or death. They may have been native Christians, but Augustine did not treat them as such. When Gregory was informed, he told Augustine to stop the cult and use the shrine for the Roman St Sixtus.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, {{while working}} long hours on his {{definitive}} book on gear cutting machinery, his energy gave {{out and he}} suffered a “nervous breakdown.” He had {{to take time off}} to recover.
