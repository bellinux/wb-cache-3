While usually a computer controls this with Pulse Position Indicators, any belt not controlled must be monitored to ensure accuracy and reduce the likelihood of problems.

Power consumptions, electromagnetic emissions, and <b>operation</b> <b>timing</b> of cryptographic hardware are examples of measurable parameters (analysis) effected by internal confident data. To prevent such attacks, SCA countermeasures are implemented. Misaligned power tracks is a considerable countermeasure which directly affect the effectiveness of SCA.

40|$|Concurrent systems, either {{hardware}} or software, {{are notoriously}} difficult to design correctly {{in large part}} due to the complexities of nondeterministic execution. A concurrent system can perform many different correct computations for a given input sequence because the absolute order of execution is dependent on factors which cannot be known at design/compile time. Synchronization constructs are used to restrict the set of possible computations to only correct computations, but insertion of synchronization constructs is a manual and error-prone task. The detection of synchronization errors is made difficult because the manifestation of an error can depend on <b>operation</b> <b>timing</b> which can change between executions. We define a class of synchronization errors and define the timing requirements to ensure the detection of these errors. We provide a coverage metric which can be used {{to determine whether or not}} a given test execution is sufficient to detect the defined class of synchronization errors. ...|$|E

We also illustrate the different ways in which flexible technology and flexible capacity affect a firm's profit under demand fluctuations.

The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the indications for the completion thyroidectomy and the effect of the <b>operation</b> <b>timing</b> on morbidity. Materials and Methods: Thirty-one consecutive patients (26 females and 5 males) with a mean age of 36. 5 ± 7. 7 years (range, 23 - 55 yrs) that underwent completion thyroidectomy were investigated. The patients, who needed re-operation for recurrence with diagnosis of histopathologically proven malignancy or re-operated for recurrence, were included. Results: Seventeen patients had the second operation performed within 10 days or more than 90 days after initial operation (group 1). Fourteen patients had re-operation between 10 and 90 days after the first procedure (group 2). Histopathological examination after the completion thyroidectomy revealed remnant tumour in 7 patients (23 %), two of them in the contralateral lobe. One patient suffered from a permanent hypoparathyroidism in group 1 and a permanent vocal cord paralysis in group 2. Conclusion: Our results suggest that other treatment modalities except total thyroidectomy are insufficient, since remnant tumour was seen over 20 % of the histopathological specimens of the completion thyroidectomy. Timing of completion thyroidectomy had no effect on the thyroid cancer development. Total thyroidectomy can be preferred in the surgical management of tiroid cancers or benign nodular goiter...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{characterization}} and {{the study}} of the radiations on their interaction with or-ganic matter is of great interest in view of the human exploration on Mars. The Ionizing RAdiation Sensor (IRAS) selected in the frame of the ExoMars/Pasteur ESA mission is a lightweight particle spectrometer combining various techniques of radiation detection in space. It characterizes the first time the radiation environment on the Mars surface, and provide dose and dose equivalent rates as precursor information absolutely necessary to develop ways to mitigate the radiation risks for future human exploration on Mars. The Martian radiation levels are much higher than those found on Earth and they are relatively low for space. Measurements on the surface will show if they are similar or not to those seen in orbit (modified by the presence of “albedo ” neutrons produced in the regolith and by the thin Martian atmosphere). IRAS consists of a telescope based on segmented silicon detectors of about 40 mm diameter and 300 m thickness, a segmented organic scintillator, and of a thermoluminescence dosimeter. The telescope will continuously monitor temporal variation of the particle count rate, the dose rate, particle and LET (Linear Energy Transfer) spectra. Tissue equivalent BC 430 scintillator material will be used to measure the neutron dose. Neutrons are selected by a criteria requiring no signal in the anti-coincidence.
