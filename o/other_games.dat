Lasker was also a research mathematician who was known for his {{contributions to}} commutative algebra, which included proving the primary decomposition of the ideals of polynomial rings. On the other hand, his philosophical works and a drama that he co-wrote received little attention.|$|E

Though the graphics were not well received, the character animations were very well received. The lack of audio dialog, which forced the player to read text for the story mode, was also a negative when many <b>other</b> <b>games</b> on the PS2 {{at the time were}} adding in voice overs. GamePro rated the overall sound a 3 out of 5. Other reviews rated the audio better, particularly the music and sound effects during the fights.|$|E

5|$|Despite being a {{game that}} used a {{graphical}} display, the cathode-ray tube amusement device is generally not considered under most definitions to {{be a candidate for}} the first video game, as it used purely analog hardware and did not run on a computing device; some loose definitions may still consider it a video game, but it is still usually disqualified as the device was never manufactured. Nevertheless, it is the earliest known interactive electronic game as well as the first to incorporate an electronic display, thus making it a forerunner to <b>other</b> <b>games</b> in the early history of video games. As the device was never manufactured or widely shown, however, it did not directly inspire any <b>other</b> <b>games</b> and had no impact on the future video game industry.|$|E

5|$|Kojima {{designed}} boss {{battles of}} Snake Eater {{to be totally}} different from those in previous Metal Gear games, or any <b>other</b> <b>games.</b> He said that the boss battle with sniper The End best represented free, open gameplay in the game. The battle takes place over a large area of dense jungle, and the player must search extensively for The End, who attacks over long range from an unknown position. This battle of attrition can last for hours, and contrasts with other boss fights in which the enemy is {{right in front of}} the player and in view the whole time. In addition, the player has the ability to both avoid this boss battle altogether by killing The End earlier in the game; or save and quit during the fight, wait a week, and reload the game to find The End having died of old age. Kojima commented that features like this do not appear in <b>other</b> <b>games.</b>|$|E
