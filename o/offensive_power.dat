5|$|In both games, {{there are}} many {{circumstances}} when a previous item can be upgraded into a more useful form. The latter three dungeons in both games will hold a more powerful version of an item received earlier in the game. Both the sword's <b>offensive</b> <b>power</b> and the shield's defensive abilities can be upgraded twice, once through passwords and again through side quests. If Link swings an enhanced sword at full health, a sword-shaped beam will escape from the sword as a ranged attack. The number of bombs and Mystical Seeds that can be held can also be increased through the same ways as the shield and sword. Roc's Feather and the Power Bracelet are special cases, as, while the two are in both games, the former can only be upgraded in Oracle of Seasons while the latter only in Oracle of Ages.|$|E
5|$|In this installment, Link gains {{experience}} {{points to}} upgrade his attack, magic, and life by defeating enemies. This feature is exclusive to Zelda II {{in the game}} series. He can raise each of these attributes {{to a maximum of}} eight levels. Raising a life level will decrease the damage Link receives when hit, raising a magic level will decrease the magic points (MP) cost of spells, and raising an attack level will strengthen his sword's <b>offensive</b> <b>power.</b> Each attribute requires a different amount of experience to level up, with the life level requiring the least number of points to level and attack requiring the most. When enough points are acquired to raise an attribute, the player may choose to level up that attribute or to cancel and continue gaining experience points towards the next level in another attribute. Once Link has raised an attribute to the maximum level of eight, further advances in that attribute will earn Link an extra life, without advancing the attribute itself. Link begins the game with four Heart Containers and four Magic Containers and can acquire up to four more of each, permanently increasing his life points and magic points respectively. Other games in The Legend of Zelda series only allow Link to increase his strength through new weapons, items, and Heart Containers. Certain enemies drain Link's experience when they attack, but he will never lose a level once raised. When a game ends or is saved, the cartridge records Link's current ability levels and the number of experience points required for the next increase, but resets his accumulated points to zero.|$|E
50|$|Rion {{has several}} types of psychic powers at his disposal. His <b>offensive</b> <b>powers</b> are enabled via drugs (which are known in the English version as PPECs Power Enhancement Chemicals). Because the number of vials of these drugs present in the game is finite, {{conservation}} is important. Rion's <b>offensive</b> <b>powers</b> have a 1-2 second charge time, making it important to find a safe interval before launching an attack. Enemies do not leave items and Rion does not gain experience for fighting them, encouraging the player to avoid combat where possible.|$|R

25|$|After Lee Lue's funeral, the Hmong guerrillas withdrew to Long Tieng. The Royalist 101 Bataillon de Parachutistes were helilifted to a {{defensive}} position at Ban Na. On 10 August 1969, PAVN troops overran Xieng Dat, scattering the Neutralists. After {{the remnants of}} the Neutralist unit were regathered at Muong Kassy, they were airlifted to Thailand for retraining. The communists still controlled the Plain of Jars. They had escalated their <b>offensive</b> <b>power</b> with tanks; to that they added seven fresh infantry battalions.|$|E
25|$|Tigres {{brought in}} {{experienced}} Argentine striker Emanuel Villa while Danilinho {{returned from his}} loan to Brazil, giving the team a highly <b>offensive</b> <b>power</b> for the Clausura 2013 season. The regular season ended with Tigres as the leader with 35 points and only two defeats. Querétaro was the eighth-placed and meant to be the rival of Tigres, but was relegated to Ascenso MX, so Monterrey was dragged to postseason. In the away leg of quarter-finals, Monterrey defeated Tigres 1–0 in a game where Monterrey had less ball possession and offensive plays. In the second game, Tigres had to win by 1–0 or by a two-goal advantage because of the away goals rule (3–1, 4–2, 5–3). Tigres came out aggressive and Danilinho scored a goal early in the game. Minutes later, with a game totally handled by Tigres, Israel Jiménez scored an own goal that tied the game at 1–1, and Tigres lost with an aggregate score of 2–1.|$|E
25|$|The German {{defensive}} {{strategy on}} the Western Front in 1917, succeeded in resisting {{the increase in}} the <b>offensive</b> <b>power</b> of the Entente, without the loss of vital territory but the attrition of German manpower was slowed rather than reversed. Unrestricted submarine warfare caused the United States to declare war on 6 April and failed to isolate Britain from its overseas sources of supply. The bombing offensive against Britain, acted to divert Anglo-French air defence resources, which slowed {{the rate at which the}} German air service was outnumbered in France. By the end of the Third Battle of Ypres in November 1917, the effectiveness of the methods of defence introduced in 1917 had been eroded and continuation of a defensive strategy in the west was made impossible. The defeat of Russia gave the German leadership a final opportunity to avoid defeat, rather than the attempts to compete with Allied numerical and industrial superiority, through economic warfare in the Atlantic and the domestic initiatives of the Hindenburg Programme, the Auxiliary Service Law and temporary demobilisation of skilled workers from the army.|$|E

25|$|Mongol invaders {{were still}} causing many {{problems}} for the Ming Empire. The Yongle Emperor prepared to eliminate this threat. He mounted five military expeditions into the Mongol steppes and crushed {{the remnants of the}} Yuan dynasty that had fled north after being defeated by the Hongwu Emperor. He repaired the northern defences and forged buffer alliances to keep the Mongols at bay in order to build an army. His strategy was to force the Mongols into economic dependence on the Chinese and to launch periodic initiatives into Mongolia to cripple their <b>offensive</b> <b>power.</b> He attempted to compel Mongolia to become a Chinese tributary, with all the tribes submitting and proclaiming themselves vassals of the Ming Empire, and wanted to contain and isolate the Mongols. Through fighting, the Yongle Emperor learned to appreciate the importance of cavalry in battle and eventually began spending much of his resources to keep horses in good supply. The emperor spent his entire life fighting the Mongols. Failures and successes came and went, but {{it should be noted that}} after the emperor's second personal campaign against the Mongols, the Ming Empire was at peace for over seven years.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of the jungle divisions proved significant for the Australian Army in that it represented {{the first time in}} its history it had adopted an organisation specifically for the conditions in which the bulk of its forces would fight, rather than just following accepted British doctrine. Previously force structure had been heavily influenced by the British Army, and the decision to adopt an organisation to suit local conditions reflected a growing maturity and independence from the imperial authorities in London. Yet it also resulted in the adoption of a two-tier force structure, with formations not designated for jungle warfare remaining on the previous scales of equipment and manning. Ultimately, while this meant that their structure was better suited to operations in Australia, they were no longer able to be used against the Japanese. As a result, the burden of the fighting increasingly fell on those formations that had been re-organised, while the remainder of the Army was relegated to garrison duties. This had largely been inevitable due to the limited manpower available though, and the Army had been forced to concentrate its <b>offensive</b> <b>power</b> in the jungle divisions, while the forces remaining in Australia were manned by troops not fit for service overseas.|$|E

500|$|Another {{attempt was}} started in February 1944 by the DNC to {{incorporate}} wartime lessons and create a cutting edge design, but he soon concluded that [...] "the power of modern weapons had increased so much that ever-increasing armour and torpedo protection was required until it became incompatible with the limited <b>offensive</b> <b>power</b> of the ship."

500|$|The delay enabled Spain to take {{advantage}} of experience gained by Britain with the world's first commissioned all-big-gun battleship, , and by the United States with its own new battleship, [...] The Spanish Navy was principally concerned with defending its three main naval bases: Ferrol, Cádiz, and Cartagena. Of secondary importance was the need to keep the new battleship design tightly constrained due to the frail Spanish economy and industrial sector. A third constraint was the need to build ships small enough to fit in existing dockyard facilities, since there were insufficient funds to both build larger battleships and to enlarge the navy's dockyards. As a result, the design requirements called for relatively heavy <b>offensive</b> <b>power</b> with minimal range and armor protection. The Navy began discussing the design requirements with Armstrong Whitworth and Vickers in 1907 well before the law was actually passed. On 5 September 1907, Vickers provided a proposed design for a 15,000-ton battleship armed with eight 12-inch guns. This design was the basis for the requirements for the design competition, which was issued on 21 April 1908.|$|E
500|$|The ship's primary <b>offensive</b> <b>power</b> {{would have}} been its {{aircraft}} complement. Graf Zeppelin would have carried 42 aircraft as designed: 12 navalized Junkers Ju 87 [...] "Stuka" [...] dive bombers, 10 Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters, and 20 Fieseler Fi 167 torpedo bombers. Later during the construction process, the aerial complement was reworked to consist of thirty Ju 87s and twelve Bf 109s, and the Fi 167s were removed altogether. As designed, Graf Zeppelin was to be fitted with eight 15 cm SK C/28 guns for defense against surface warships. This number was later increased to sixteen. Her anti-aircraft battery consisted of ten 10.5 cm SK C/33 gunslater increased to twelvetwenty-two 3.7 cm SK C/30 guns, and twenty-eight 2 cm guns. The ship's flight deck was protected with up to [...] of Wotan Weich steel armor. A [...] thick armored deck was located under the deck to protect the ship's vitals from aerial attacks.

500|$|To {{combat the}} German Panzerschiffe, the French built two small s {{in the early}} 1930s. This in turn {{prompted}} the German navy to begin plans for a more powerful battlecruiser design. Since 1933, Erich Raeder, {{the head of the}} German Navy, had argued to increase the defensive qualities of the Panzerschiffe, and to increase the <b>offensive</b> <b>power</b> of the main battery {{with the addition of a}} third triple turret. This was also the view of the Kriegsmarine, which saw the 19,000-ton design as being unbalanced. Hitler agreed to increased armour protection and internal subdivision, but refused to permit an increase in armament. Finally, by February 1934, Hitler acquiesced over the addition of the third turret. The new ship would displace [...] and be armed with nine 28.3cm guns in three triple turrets. To secure political freedom to build the new ships, Hitler concluded the 1935Anglo-German Naval Agreement, which guaranteed Great Britain a 3to 1superiority in capital ships, and, more importantly, removed the limitations of the Treaty of Versailles for the German navy.|$|E

500|$|In {{front of}} this Main Defence Line was the IJssel-Maaslinie, a {{covering}} line along the rivers IJssel and Maas, connected by positions in the Betuwe, again with pillboxes and lightly occupied by a screen of fourteen [...] "border battalions". Late in 1939 General Van Voorst tot Voorst, reviving plans he had already worked out in 1937, proposed {{to make use of}} the excellent defensive opportunities these rivers offered. He proposed a shift to a more mobile strategy by fighting a delaying battle at the plausible crossing sites near Arnhem and Gennep to force the German divisions to spend much of their <b>offensive</b> <b>power</b> before they had reached the MDL, and ideally even defeat them. This was deemed too risky by the Dutch government and General Reijnders. The latter wanted the army to first offer heavy resistance at the Grebbe Line and Peel Raam Position, and then fall back to the Fortress Holland. This also was considered too dangerous by the government, especially in light of German air supremacy, and had the disadvantage of having to fully prepare two lines. Reijnders had already been denied full military authority in the defence zones; the conflict about strategy further undermined his political position. On 5 February 1940 he was forced to offer his resignation because of these disagreements with his superiors. He was replaced by General Henry G. Winkelman who decided that in the north the Grebbe Line would be the main defence line where the decisive battle was to be waged, partly because it would there be easier to break out with a counteroffensive if the conditions were favourable.
