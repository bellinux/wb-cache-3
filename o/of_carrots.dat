40|$|In {{the present}} experiment, the {{significance}} of cultivar (convention-al and coloured) and of {{the application of the}} soil fertility enhancer UGmax on health-promoting properties <b>of</b> <b>carrot</b> roots subjected to the freezing process <b>of</b> <b>carrot</b> cubes after water blanching was investigated. The selection of cultivar turned out to be highly signif-icant with respect to the development of health-promoting properties <b>of</b> <b>carrot</b> roots. The highest antioxidant properties were found in the purple cultivar ‘Deep Purple’. Its mean antioxidant capacity accounted for 5. 31 mmol Fe+ 2 · kg– 1 f. m. Essential for health-promoting properties were the contents of anthocyanins (R 2 = 0. 83), chlorogenic acid (R 2 = 0. 81) and total polyphenolics (R 2 = 0. 71). The application of the biological agent UGmax improved the qual-ity <b>of</b> <b>carrot</b> significantly, increasing the content of total carotenoids and reducing the losses of ascorbic acid during processing. The freezing process negatively influenced the antioxidative properties <b>of</b> <b>carrot</b> irrespective <b>of</b> cultivar and applied agro-technique (use of UGmax), {{especially in the case of}} water-soluble antioxidants such as anthocyanins and ascorbic acid...|$|R

5|$|The {{provitamin}} A beta-carotene from carrots {{does not}} actually help {{people to see}} in the dark unless they suffer from a deficiency of vitamin A. This myth was propaganda used by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War to explain why their pilots had improved success during night air battles, but was actually used to disguise advances in radar technology and the use of red lights on instrument panels. Nevertheless, the consumption <b>of</b> <b>carrots</b> was advocated in Britain at the time as part of a Dig for Victory campaign. A radio programme called The Kitchen Front encouraged people to grow, store and use carrots in various novel ways, including making carrot jam and Woolton pie, named after the Lord Woolton, the Minister for Food. The British public during WWII generally believed that eating carrots would help them see better at night and in 1942 there was a 100,000 ton surplus <b>of</b> <b>carrots</b> from the extra production.|$|E

Carrot juice is also widely marketed, especially as a health drink, either stand-alone or blended with juices extracted from fruits and other vegetables.|$|E
5|$|Several {{ingredient}} variations {{exist in}} carrot soup preparations. Some carrot soups are prepared using coconut milk, coconut water, coconut cream, coconut butter or coconut pieces. Some versions include ginger as an ingredient, and some include curry. Green carrot leaves (greens) {{from the top}} <b>of</b> <b>carrots</b> {{can be used as}} an ingredient in the dish. Chopped mint leaves are used in some versions. It can be served hot or chilled. Salt and pepper can be used to season the dish, and nutmeg is sometimes used as a seasoning.

5|$|There {{are several}} {{diseases}} that {{can reduce the}} yield and market value <b>of</b> <b>carrots.</b> The most devastating carrot disease is Alternaria leaf blight, which {{has been known to}} eradicate entire crops. A bacterial leaf blight caused by Xanthomonas campestris can also be destructive in warm, humid areas. Root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne species) can cause stubby or forked roots, or galls. Cavity spot, caused by the oomycetes Pythium violae and Pythium sulcatum, results in irregularly shaped, depressed lesions on the taproots.|$|E

40|$|Exogenous {{gibberellin}} altered morphology, anatomic and transcriptional regulatory networks <b>of</b> hormones in <b>carrot</b> {{root and}} shoot Guang-Long Wang, Feng Que, Zhi-Sheng Xu, Feng Wang and Ai-Sheng Xiong* Background: Gibberellins stimulate cell elongation and expansion during plant growth and development. Carrot is a root plant with great value and undergoes obvious alteration in organ size {{over the period}} of plant growth. However, the roles <b>of</b> gibberellins in <b>carrot</b> remain unclear. Results: To investigate the effects of gibberelliins on the growth <b>of</b> <b>carrot,</b> we treated carrot plants with gibberellic acid 3 (GA 3) or paclobutrazol (a gibberellin inhibitor). The results found that GA 3 dramatically reduced the root growth but stimulated the shoot growth <b>of</b> <b>carrot.</b> It also significantly promoted xylem development in the tuberous root <b>of</b> <b>carrot.</b> In addition, transcript levels of genes related to gibberellins, auxin, cytokinins, abscisic acid and brassinolides were altered in response to increased or reduced gibberellins. Conclusions: The inhibited tuberous root growth but enhanced shoot growth in plants treated with GA 3 can be principally attributed to {{the changes in the}} xylem development <b>of</b> <b>carrot</b> roots. Negative feedback regulation mechanism of gibberellin biosynthesis also occurred in response to altered gibberellin accumulation. Gibberellins may interact with other hormones to regulate carrot plant growth through crosstalk mechanisms. This study provided novel insights into the functions of gibberellins in the growth and development <b>of</b> <b>carrot...</b>|$|R

Working in the hospital's clinic, House's first patient {{is a man who}} is orange because of an over-consumption <b>of</b> <b>carrots</b> and mega-dose vitamins (niacin). House also treats a ten-year-old boy whose mother allows him to use his asthmatic inhaler only intermittently instead of daily as prescribed. House criticises the mother for making such a drastic medical decision without first learning more about asthma. During his monologue, House stumbles on an idea and leaves quickly to treat Adler; he diagnoses her with cerebral vasculitis, despite having no proof. House treats Adler with steroids, which improves her condition greatly for a time, until she starts seizing and has heart failure. The team brings her back with a defibrillator.|$|E

Carrot commodity is then taken into consideration in the implementation of agropolitan program, in the form of provision of infrastructure and community development programs. The objectives of the research study are to investigate the value chain <b>of</b> <b>carrot</b> in Suthomadansih, as well as to analyze how the implementation of agropolitan program supports the value chain <b>of</b> <b>carrot.</b> Meanwhile, in order to investigate how the implementation of agropolitan program in suthomadansih supports to value chain <b>of</b> <b>carrot,</b> there are three indicators that will be identified; the development of supporting infrastructure, agribusiness system, and development of human resource (Iqbal and Iwan, 2009). Both of qualitative and quantitative analysis has been applied into the study with the performance table of the implementation of agropolitan program and value chain analysis as tool to conduct the analysis. Based on the value chain <b>of</b> <b>carrot</b> in Suthomadansih, some development programs from Local Government through the agropolitan program has been conducted from upstream to downstream <b>of</b> <b>carrot</b> commodity. However, some programs are failed to support the value chain <b>of</b> <b>carrot</b> so that the improvement of value chain <b>of</b> <b>carrot</b> could not be optimized. Those programs are Agribusiness Sub Terminal, Worta Cluster, Vitmaka, and Farm Road Improvement Program. The implementation of agropolitan program is not sustainable because of the absence of the budgets of local governments. The program is only implemented for 3 years (2007 - 2009) so that there are no significant effects of the program on the agricultural sector, especially for carrot commodity...|$|R
