40|$|While {{influenza}} viruses are {{a common}} respiratory pathogen, sporadic reports of conjunctivitis following human infection demonstrates the ability of this virus to cause disease outside of the respiratory tract. The ocular surface represents both a potential site of virus replication and a portal of entry for establishment of a respiratory infection. However, the properties which govern ocular tropism of influenza viruses, the mechanisms of virus spread from ocular to respiratory tissue, and the potential differences in respiratory disease initiated from different exposure routes are poorly understood. Here, we established a ferret model of ocular inoculation to explore the development of virus pathogenicity and transmissibility following influenza virus exposure by the <b>ocular</b> <b>route.</b> We found that multiple subtypes of human and avian influenza viruses mounted a productive virus infection in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets following ocular inoculation, and were additionally detected in ocular tissue during the acute phase of infection. H 5 N 1 viruses maintained their ability for systemic spread and lethal infection following inoculation by the <b>ocular</b> <b>route.</b> Replication-independent deposition of virus inoculum from ocular to respiratory tissue {{was limited to the}} nares and upper trachea, unlike traditional intranasal inoculation which results in virus deposition in both upper and lower respiratory tract tissues.

Guinea pigs immunized with viable antigen were more likely to develop resistance to challenge infection and, in general, had a significantly greater degree of protection than animals immunized with inactivated antigen. No one route seemed superior in producing a protective response. Animals in all groups demonstrating protection developed serum and secretion immunoglobulin G antibody responses to chlamydiae.

40|$|Abstract: Animal {{studies have}} been carried out to {{evaluate}} the safety use of kajal, a universal eye cosmetic, in order to confirm or contradict the previous data, which is insufficient and confusing for its limitation to use as cosmetic and to assess its exposure, susceptibility and risk. Hashmi kajal tube (net weight 4. 5 g), an eye cosmetic manufactured by M/s A. Q. and company international Pakistan was used as source for study. The elemental analysis of Kajal was carried out on atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The safety profile studies were carried out in rats (both male and female) by oral route and in rabbits by <b>ocular</b> <b>route</b> according to the standard method. The biochemical and elemental analysis of blood samples was carried out at 0, 45 and 90 days. Kajal was analyzed chemically using standard method of AOAC and found to contain Zinc (18. 91 %), Total Ash (37. 23 %) and does not contain sulfur, lead, cadmium, antimony, mercury and arsenic. All the animals exhibited normal physiological activities and an increase in body weights of both test and control groups. Zinc levels remained constant throughout the experimental period in all test and control rabbits. There was no mortality and all animals remained healthy and active throughout the experimental period. Long term application (90 days) of kajal in single and double doses showed no effect on body weight, health and normal behavior of the experimental animals group as compared to the control group and there was no mortality during the experimental period. Furthermore, liver and kidney function tests were normal, indicating non-toxic effect of the kajal on vital organs. Key words: Kajal Toxicity Elemental analysis Safety profil...|$|E
40|$|Avian H 7 {{influenza}} viruses {{have been}} responsible for poultry outbreaks worldwide and have resulted in numerous cases of human infection in recent years. The high rate of conjunctivitis associated with avian H 7 subtype virus infections may represent a portal of entry for avian influenza viruses and highlights the need to better understand the apparent ocular tropism observed in humans. To study this, mice were inoculated by the <b>ocular</b> <b>route</b> with viruses of multiple subtypes and degrees of virulence. We found that in contrast to human (H 3 N 2 and H 1 N 1) viruses, H 7 N 7 viruses isolated from The Netherlands in 2003 and H 7 N 3 viruses isolated from British Columbia, Canada, in 2004, two subtypes that were highly virulent for poultry, replicated to a significant titer in the mouse eye. Remarkably, an H 7 N 7 virus, as well as some avian H 5 N 1 viruses, spread systemically following ocular inoculation, including to the brain, resulting in morbidity and mortality of mice. This correlated with efficient replication of highly pathogenic H 7 and H 5 subtypes in murine corneal epithelial sheets (ex vivo) and primary human corneal epithelial cells (in vitro). Influenza viruses were labeled to identify the virus attachment site in the mouse cornea. Although we found abundant H 7 virus attachment to corneal epithelial tissue, this did not account for the differences in virus replication as multiple subtypes were able to attach to these cells. These findings demonstrate that avian influenza viruses within H 7 and H 5 subtypes are capable of using the eye as a portal of entry...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} Newcastle disease (ND) in South Africa has proved {{difficult}} since 2002 following {{the introduction of}} lineage 5 d/VIId Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strain (‘‘goose paramyxovirus’’ – GPMV) to which commercially available ND vaccines appeared less effective. Most of the ND infections, even in fully vaccinated hens were characterized consistently by a drop in egg production. In this study, commercial and SPF hens-in-lay were vaccinated with La Sota vaccine and challenged with a GPMV isolate. Immunohistochemical labeling {{was used to determine}} the distribution of viral antigen in the oviduct of the hens. Following reports that cloacal vaccination offered better protection against egg production losses than the oro-nasal route, the efficacy of cloacal and <b>ocular</b> <b>routes</b> of vaccination against challenge were compared. Results showed that La Sota vaccine offered birds 100 % protection against the virulent ND (GPMV) virus challenge from clinical disease and death, but not against infection and replication of the GPMV, as birds showed varying degrees of macropathology. Histopathology of the oviduct of infected birds revealed multifocal lymphocytic inflammation in the interstitium as well as mild glandular ectasia and mild edema. Finely granular NDV-specific immunolabeling was demonstrated in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells and mononuclear (lymphohistiocytic) cells in the interstitium of the oviduct. Both vaccine and virulent GPMV showed greatest tropism for the uterus (versus the magnum and isthmus). There was no clear difference in the protection of the oviduct and in the distribution of oviductal GPMV antigens between the two routes of vaccination.

40|$|Background: The use of e-cigarettes has {{increased}} {{during the past}} few years. Exposure to e-cigarette liquids, whether intentional or accidental, may lead to adverse events our aim was to assess factors associated with e-cigarette exposures across European Union Member States (EU MS). Methods: A retrospective analysis of exposures associated with e-cigarettes reported to national poison centers was performed covering incidents from 2012 to March 2015 from 10 EU MS. De-identified and anonymous raw data was acquired. Results: In total, 277 incidents were reported. Unintentional exposure was the most frequently cited type of exposure (71. 3 %), while e-cigarette refill vials were responsible {{for the majority of the}} reported incidents (87. 3 %). Two-thirds of all exposures (67. 5 %) occurred as ingestion of e-liquids, which was more frequent among children (≤ 5 years, 6 – 18 years) compared to adults (87. 0 % vs. 59. 3 % vs. 57. 6 %, p < 0. 001 respectively), exposure via the respiratory (5. 4 % vs. 22. 2 % vs. 22. 2 %, p < 0. 001) were more frequent among paediatric patients while <b>ocular</b> <b>routes</b> (2. 2 % vs. 3. 7 % vs. 11. 4 %, p = 0. 021) were more frequent among adults. Logistic regression analyses indicated that paediatric incidents (≤ 5 years) were more likely to be through ingestion (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] = 4. 36, 95 % Confidence Interval [C. I. ]: 1. 87 – 10. 18), but less likely to have a reported clinical effect (aOR = 0. 41, 95 % C. I. : 0. 21 – 0. 82). Conclusions: Our study highlighted parameters related to e-cigarette exposure incidents in 10 EU MS, the results of which indicate that consideration should be given to the design features which may mitigate risks, thereby protecting users, non-users and especially children...|$|R
40|$|Open {{reading frame}} (ORF) O and ORF P {{partially}} overlap and are located antisense to the γ 134. 5 gene within the domain transcribed during latency. In wild-type virus-infected cells, ORF O and ORF P are completely repressed during productive infection by ICP 4, the major viral transcriptional activator/repressor. In cells infected with a mutant in which ORF P was derepressed {{there was a}} significant delay in the appearance of the viral α-regulatory proteins ICP 0 and ICP 22. The ORF O protein binds to and inhibits ICP 4 binding to its cognate DNA site in vitro. These characteristics suggested a role for ORF O and ORF P in the establishment of latency. To test this hypothesis, two recombinant viruses were constructed. In the first, R 7538 (P−/O−), the ORF P initiator methionine codon, which also serves as the initiator methionine codon for ORF O, was replaced and a diagnostic restriction endonuclease was introduced upstream. In the second, R 7543 (P−/O−) R, the mutations were repaired to restore the wild-type virus sequences. We report the following. (i) The R 7538 (P−/O−) mutant failed to express ORF O and ORF P proteins but expressed a wild-type γ 134. 5 protein. (ii) R 7538 (P−/O−) yields were {{similar to that of the}} wild type following infection of cell culture or following infection of mice by intracerebral or <b>ocular</b> <b>routes.</b> (iii) R 7538 (P−/O−) virus reactivated from latency following explanation and cocultivation of murine trigeminal ganglia with Vero cells at a frequency similar to that of the wild type, herpes simplex virus 1 (F). (iv) The amount of latent R 7538 (P−/O−) virus as assayed by quantitative PCR is eightfold less than that of the repair virus. The repaired virus could not be differentiated from the wild-type parent in any of the assays done in this study. We conclude that ORF O and ORF P are not essential for the establishment of latency in mice but may play a role in determining the quantity of latent virus maintained in sensory neurons...|$|R
