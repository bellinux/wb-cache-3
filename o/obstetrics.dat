5|$|Paul {{earned a}} Doctor of Medicine degree from Duke University's School of Medicine in 1961, and {{completed}} his medical internship at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit and his residency in <b>obstetrics</b> and gynecology at Magee-Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh. Paul {{served as a}} flight surgeon in the United States Air Force from 1963 to 1965 {{and then in the}} United States Air National Guard from 1965 to 1968. Paul and his wife then relocated to Texas, where he began a private practice in <b>obstetrics</b> and gynecology.|$|E
5|$|William S. Kroger, who DeLee {{successfully}} revived as {{a newborn}} in 1906, graduated from {{medical school in}} 1930 and served a residency under DeLee in <b>obstetrics,</b> gynecology and neuroendocrinology. Since his childhood, Kroger had been urged by his mother {{to follow in the}} footsteps of the doctor who had saved his life. Kroger became a well-known authority on the use of hypnosis in <b>obstetrics</b> and other medical specialties.|$|E
5|$|DeLee {{was one of}} {{the pioneers}} of filmmaking for the purpose of medical teaching. He {{authored}} a paper in the mid-1930s, Sound Motion Pictures in <b>Obstetrics,</b> which described the necessary components of a medical film, including scripts, props, lighting, sound and expert staff members.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Puerto Rico, Betances and Ruiz proposed {{the establishment of}} a municipal hospital {{to take care of the}} city's poor. The hospital, named Hospital San Antonio, opened on January 18, 1865, with subscription funds and an assignment from the Spanish local government. The Hospital San Antonio is now an <b>obstetrics</b> and pediatrics hospital in the city.|$|E
5|$|Despite his father's {{wishes that}} DeLee become a rabbi, DeLee {{attended}} Chicago Medical College. Of particular influence on DeLee was <b>obstetrics</b> professor W. W. Jaggard. He graduated in 1891. Author Charlotte Borst noted {{that most women}} delivered {{at home in the}} 1870s through 1890s; medical students at Northwestern only witnessed deliveries at that time if they could bribe women into having their babies at the hospital's amphitheatre. DeLee felt fortunate to have observed two such births while he was a student.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the loss}} of the 1984 senate race, Paul {{returned}} to his <b>obstetrics</b> practice and took part {{in a number of other}} business ventures. Along with his former congressional chief of staff, Lew Rockwell, Paul founded a for-profit enterprise, Ron Paul & Associates, Inc. (RP) in 1984, with Paul serving as president, Rockwell as vice president, Paul's wife Carol as secretary, and daughter Lori Pyeatt as treasurer.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, a mothers aid {{group from}} the Chicago Maternity Center raised $30,000 to endow a {{professorship}} in <b>obstetrics</b> in DeLee's name at the University of Chicago. The board of directors for the Chicago Lying-in Hospital awards the Joseph Bolivar DeLee Humanitarian Award annually to an individual who has {{made significant contributions to}} the care of women and children. DeLee's nephew, Sol DeLee, was a Las Vegas obstetrician who wrote several editions of the book Safeguarding Motherhood from the 1940s to 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Bolivar DeLee (October 28, 1869 – April 2, 1942) was an American {{physician}} who {{became known as}} the father of modern <b>obstetrics.</b> DeLee founded the Chicago Lying-in Hospital, where he introduced the first portable infant incubator. Early in his career, he was associated with the medical school at Northwestern University. After 1929, he was employed by the medical school at the University of Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Madeleine's {{parents are}} both {{physicians}} and practising Roman Catholics. Kate Marie McCann, née Healy (born 1968, Huyton, near Liverpool) attended All Saints School in Anfield, then Notre Dame High School in Everton Valley, graduating in 1992 {{with a degree}} in medicine from the University of Dundee. She moved briefly into <b>obstetrics</b> and gynaecology, then anaesthetics, and finally general practice.|$|E
5|$|Mickal was {{the first}} player from LSU to ever be drafted into the NFL, {{selected}} in the sixth round of the 1936 NFL Draft by the Detroit Lions. However, he did not play in the NFL. He instead chose to complete his medical degree at the Louisiana State University School of Medicine, where he graduated from in 1940. He served as a major in the U.S. Army Medical Corps during World War II. After the war, he worked in <b>obstetrics</b> and gynecology at New Orleans Charity Hospital from 1946 to 1949, shortly after which he was hired to the LSU medical faculty. In 1959, he became the head professor of the LSU Medical School, a position he served in {{until his retirement in}} 1980. He was {{a founding member of the}} Society of Gynecologic Oncology and the Infectious Disease Society for <b>Obstetrics</b> and Gynecology, and served as president of the Society of Gynecologic Surgeons from 1981 to 1982. From 1985 until his death in 2001 he was vice president for medical affairs at Kenner Regional Medical Center.|$|E

5|$|Weston Education Centre Library: Situated at the Denmark Hill Campus, {{the library}} has {{particular}} strengths {{in the areas}} of gastroenterology, liver disease, diabetes, <b>obstetrics,</b> gynaecology, paediatrics and the history of medicine. The collection supports the teaching and research of the GKT School of Medicine and the Dental Institute, and also the clinical work of the King's College Hospital and the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, at {{the annual}} meeting of the American Association for the Study and Prevention of Infant Mortality, DeLee spoke out against the use of {{midwives}} for childbirth. DeLee said that midwives stunted the progress of the obsetrical profession and said that he refused to take part in the education of a provider that lowered the standards of the profession. If <b>obstetrics</b> were seen as dignified work that could draw more than the menial fees charged by midwives, DeLee said, many young physicians would be willing to deliver the patients that were then under the care of midwives.|$|E
5|$|The first {{manslaughter}} {{charge was}} in March 1888, when Abby H. Corner, a practitioner in Medford, Massachusetts, attended {{to her daughter}} during childbirth; the daughter bled to death and the baby did not survive. The defense argued {{that they might have}} died even with medical attention, and Corner was acquitted. To the dismay of the Christian Scientists' Association (the secretary resigned), Eddy distanced herself from Corner, telling the Boston Globe that Corner had only attended the college for one term and had never entered the <b>obstetrics</b> class.|$|E
5|$|A {{key feature}} of the Cadet Nurse Corps program was its {{accelerated}} training curricula. Participating schools of nursing were required to compress the traditional nursing program of 36 months to 30 months. They were also bound to provide the students with the four clinical experiences of medical, surgical, <b>obstetrics,</b> and pediatrics. The students became senior cadets {{in the last six}} months before graduation, requiring them to serve in a federal or civilian hospital. They rendered full-time service equivalent to that of a graduate nurse. During their first nine months of service, the cadets were protected by regulation from working on the wards for more than 24 hours each week. Junior cadets typically worked between 40 and 48 hours each week, including classes. Senior cadets were free of classes. All State Boards of Nursing modified their regulations to agree with the accelerated program.|$|E
5|$|Adewole has {{received}} several fellowship awards, {{such as the}} fellowship of the Nigerian Academy of Science, the National Postgraduate Medical College of Nigeria, and fellowship of the West African College of Surgeons. He {{is a member of}} several academic organisations such as the American Society of Clinical Oncology, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Nigerian Medical Association, International AIDS Society, International AIDS Society, International Society for Infectious Diseases, and the Society of Gynaecology and <b>Obstetrics</b> of Nigeria. In 2013, he became the only Nigerian professor appointed to serve as member of council of the Association of Commonwealth Universities. The association represents 535 universities from 37 Commonwealth countries. He was also appointed {{as a member of the}} international advisory board of the African Cancer Institute, a comprehensive cancer centre in sub-Saharan black Africa.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, {{the same}} year he {{graduated}} from the University of Ibadan, he joined the University College Hospital, Ibadan. In 1979, he left the hospital for Sokoto for a compulsory year of service in the National Youth Service Corps. On completion of his service, he worked for a year as a medical officer at Adeoyo Maternity Hospital, Ibadan, before returning to the college hospital as a senior house officer of the department of <b>obstetrics</b> and gynaecology. He held the position for one year before he was appointed registrar in 1982. In 1985, he left Nigeria for a research fellowship in the department of medical oncology at Charing Cross Hospital in London. Following completion of the fellowship programme, he returned to Nigeria to join the Royal Crown Specialist Hospital, Ibadan, where he spent four years before returning to the University College Hospital as Consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist.|$|E
5|$|In the interim, {{rather than}} await a decision, Ferrari {{continued}} her studies. Between 1921 and 1923 she visited many clinics in Europe, including facilities in Austria, Belgium, England, France, Germany and Italy. She {{assisted in the}} clinic of Marie Curie in Paris {{as well as in}} the Columbia Hospital for Women and Lying-In Asylum in Washington, DC. The Faculty of Medicine of Paris awarded her the first diploma ever given to a woman for studies in urinary tract monitoring. In 1924, she designed a vaginoscope, which was much easier to sterilize and was more adaptable to multiple specula than previous models. The device significantly improved services which were available to women in Brazil, and was featured in the articles of the Journal of Gynecology and <b>Obstetrics</b> of Rio de Janeiro. The innovation won the Grand Prize at the 1924 Congreso Hispano Lusitano Americano de Ciencias Médicas held in Seville, Spain.|$|E
5|$|Miri Hospital started {{operation}} on 6 May 1995, located 2.5km away from Miri city centre {{and with an}} area of 87.11 hectares. The hospital has 339 beds, and it provides specialist services such as surgery, ophthalmology, <b>obstetrics</b> and gynaecology (ONG), and radiology. It is also the secondary referral hospital in the northern region of Sarawak. There are also 2 polyclinics in Miri namely Miri polyclinic and Tudan polyclinic. Miri City Medical Centre is a private hospital that started its operation in 2002 and has 30 beds. It is located at Hokkien Road, Miri. Columbia Asia Medical Centre was formerly known as Selesa Medical Centre. It was acquired in 1998, located 4km downtown Miri. It serves the communities from Miri, Limbang, Marudi, and Brunei. Shell employees make up the largest customer base for this private hospital.|$|E
5|$|Ovine <b>obstetrics</b> can be problematic. By {{selectively}} breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with high productivity {{is one of}} the dilemmas of sheep breeding. In the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs. After the birth, ewes ideally break the amniotic sac (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb. Most lambs will begin standing within an hour of birth. In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital colostrum milk. Lambs that either fail to nurse or are rejected by the ewe require help to survive, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.|$|E
5|$|A patient, Jillian Miller (Jessica Stroup), is {{admitted}} in <b>obstetrics</b> and gynaecology, and is revealed {{to suffer from}} advanced cervical cancer, which leads to her contacting her parents, from whom she ran away from years ago, along with her best friend Rachel Meyer (Rachel Boston). Stevens quickly becomes emotionally involved in the patient's situation and encourages her to return home, after learning that the two girls were Amish, shunned from their natal village. Torres and Yang operate on a runner who {{is admitted}} in orthopedics, coping {{with the news that}} he {{will never be able to}} compete in races after the extensive surgical procedure. Sloan announces his plans of returning to New York City, but abruptly decides to stay in Seattle, following Grey accidentally revealing Webber's retirement plans. Shepherd is displeased with Sloan's decision, which results in an argument between him and Grey, which threatens putting damage on their relationship. Webber returns to his wife, Adele (Loretta Devine), seeking forgiveness, but is left devastated at the realization that she has been spending the night with another man. Bailey ultimately finds support in Stevens, who proves enthusiastic to spend her entire US$8 million inheritance, for the opening of the free clinic. At the conclusion of the episode, Yang confides in Burke, who unexpectedly proposes to her, whereas O'Malley, who finally admits how affected he was by the death of his father, proposes to Torres.|$|E
5|$|He {{began his}} {{academic}} career as lecturer grade I at the College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, {{where he became}} a senior lecturer in 1992. On 1 October 1997, he was appointed {{a professor of medicine}} at the University of Ibadan, the same year he was appointed as a member of the University Senate. In 1999, he was appointed as acting head of the department of <b>obstetrics</b> and gynaecology. He served in that capacity for one year. On 1 August 2000, he was appointed as the Dean, Faculty of Clinical Sciences and Dentistry, a position he held until 31 July 2002. On 1 August 2002 he was appointed as Provost, college of medicine and was succeeded by Professor Akinyinka Omigbodun. While serving in this capacity, he was member of the committee of provost and deans as well as chairman, university campus committee on AIDS. He also served as Chairman of the committee on evaluation of academic staff in 2004. On 1 May 2010, he became an adjunct professor at Northwestern University in Chicago. In December 2010, he was appointed as the 11th substantive vice-chancellor of the University of Ibadan, succeeding Olufemi Bamiro, a mechanical engineering professor and member of the Nigerian Academy of Engineering.|$|E
5|$|Ovine <b>obstetrics</b> can be problematic. By {{selectively}} breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing. However, it {{is a myth}} that sheep cannot lamb without human assistance; many ewes give birth directly in pasture without aid. This can be proven {{by the fact that}} they give birth in the wild. Balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding. While the majority of births are relatively normal and do not require intervention, many complications may arise. A lamb may present in the normal fashion (with both legs and head forward), but may simply be too large to slide out of the birth canal. This often happens when large rams are crossed with diminutive ewes (this is related to breed, rams are naturally larger than ewes by comparison). Lambs may also present themselves with one shoulder to the side, completely backward, or with only some of their limbs protruding. Lambs may also be spontaneously aborted or stillborn. Reproductive failure is a common consequence of infections such as toxoplasmosis and foot-and-mouth disease. Some types of abortion in sheep are preventable by vaccinations against these infections.|$|E
5|$|Yang expresses {{difficulty}} {{connecting with}} the children on pediatrics, to Robbins' disappointment. Tom becomes frightened when he notices Lexie is not wearing a name tag, so she attacks her and runs away. His mother is subsequently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm, for which requires surgery, and Tom falls down the stairs, for which also requires surgery. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) returns to the hospital, and informs Robbins that Yang is just sucking up. The Crawley's are uneasy about agreeing to surgery, but Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) convinces them {{that it is the}} right thing to do. An <b>obstetrics</b> and gynecology resident accidentally cuts off a baby's arm during a caesarian section, but it is healed by plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), Robbins, and Yang. Stevens assists Shepherd with a five-hour craniotomy, and Karev is fearful that she cannot handle it, although she is ultimately able to complete the surgery. At the conclusion of the episode, human resources sends out an email notifying Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback) and Dr. Steve Mostow (Mark Saul)'s wife Megan (Molly Kidder), that they have been fired.|$|E
25|$|<b>Obstetrics</b> is {{the field}} of study {{concentrated}} on pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. As a medical specialty, <b>obstetrics</b> is combined with gynaecology under the discipline known as <b>obstetrics</b> and gynaecology (OB/GYN) which is a surgical field.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, {{he assumed}} a {{teaching}} position (1967–1972) {{as an assistant}} professor of <b>Obstetrics</b> and Gynecology with the State University of New York, Brooklyn. He also became the Director of the <b>Obstetrics</b> and Gynecology Department (1967–1981) at the Methodist Hospital of Brooklyn, New York. In addition (1972–1981), he served as a professor in the Department of <b>Obstetrics</b> and Gynecology at the Downstate Medical Center of the State University of New York, Brooklyn, New York.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{doctors who}} {{practice}} <b>obstetrics</b> include categorically specialized obstetricians, family practitioners and general practitioners whose training, skills and practices include <b>obstetrics,</b> {{and in some}} contexts general surgeons. These physicians and surgeons variously provide care across the whole spectrum of normal and abnormal births and pathological labour conditions. Categorically specialized obstetricians are qualified surgeons, so they can undertake surgical procedures relating to childbirth. Some family practitioners or general practitioners also perform obstetrical surgery. Obstetrical procedures include cesarean sections, episiotomies, and assisted delivery. Categorical specialists in <b>obstetrics</b> are commonly dually trained in <b>obstetrics</b> and gynecology (OB/GYN), and may provide other medical and surgical gynecological care, and may incorporate more general, well-woman, primary care elements in their practices. Maternal-fetal medicine specialists are obstetrician/gynecologists subspecialized in managing and treating high-risk pregnancy and delivery.|$|E
25|$|Clemetson {{moved to}} New Orleans, Louisiana in 1981, {{and became a}} {{professor}} of <b>Obstetrics</b> and Gynecology at Tulane University School of Medicine, and the Director of <b>Obstetrics</b> and Gynecology at the Huey P. Long Medical Center, Pineville, Louisiana. He also became a consultant in Gynecology for the Department of Surgery, Veterans Administration Hospital, Pineville, Louisiana.|$|E
25|$|After graduation, {{he became}} a Royal Air Force medical officer for two years, and then {{returned}} to Oxford University in 1950 for a MA degree. In 1950, as a research assistant in <b>Obstetrics,</b> he started to pursue research into preeclamptic toxaemia and started to publish medical papers in 1953. In 1952, he was named a Nichols Research Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine. From 1952 through 1956, he served at various hospitals in England as the House Surgeon of either <b>Obstetrics</b> or Gynecology and, in 1956, became a lecturer in <b>Obstetrics</b> and Gynecology at London University.|$|E
25|$|Even 18th century {{physicians}} {{expected that}} <b>obstetrics</b> {{would continue to}} grow, the opposite happened. <b>Obstetrics</b> entered a stage of stagnation in the 19th century, which lasted until about the 1880s. The central explanation {{for the lack of}} advancement during this time was substantially due to the rejection of <b>obstetrics</b> by the medical community. The 19th century marked an era of medical reform in Europe and increased regulation over the medical profession. Major European institutions such as The College of Physicians and Surgeons considered delivering babies ungentlemanly work and refused {{to have anything to do}} with childbirth as a whole. Even when Medical Act 1858 was introduced, which stated that medical students could qualify as doctors, midwifery was entirely ignored. This made it nearly impossible to pursue an education in midwifery and also have the recognition of being a doctor or surgeon. <b>Obstetrics</b> was pushed to the side.|$|E
