5|$|A small {{offering}} chapel is adjoining {{the eastern}} side of the main pyramid and is barely visible today. It consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> two pillared room with a large quartzite false door and two narrow chambers on the sides. Like the mortuary temple, the chapel was floored with black basalt. Its walls however were made of Tura limestone and granite and were adorned with fine reliefs of offering scenes.|$|E
5|$|A special but unusual {{consideration}} is cardiogenic shock, where {{the blood pressure}} is decreased not due to dehydration but due to inability of the heart to pump blood through the blood vessels. This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the central venous pressure (which requires the insertion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> venous catheter in a large upper body vein), and the administration of medication that increases the heart pumping action and blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Medical procedures, {{such as the}} {{insertion}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> venous catheter {{into one of the}} chest veins or the taking of biopsy samples from lung tissue, may lead to pneumothorax. The administration of positive pressure ventilation, either mechanical ventilation or non-invasive ventilation, can result in barotrauma (pressure-related injury) leading to a pneumothorax.|$|E

5|$|A round Norman-style apse {{was added}} to the church in 1868, the architects being the Lancaster {{partnership}} of Paley and Austin. The incumbent, the Rev. Thomas Clarke, paid for this addition, but died before its construction was complete. Architect J.S.Crowther oversaw further alterations in 1881–83; a baptistery was built, the organ was moved and choir stalls were built in the chancel. Some work was done to the interior of the tower in 1908. Renovations in 1955 included the addition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> aisle and the removal of some of the church furnishings. The Victorian pulpit was replaced. A small extension was added north of the tower in 2005.|$|E

5|$|A {{settlement}} and cemetery of the Lengyel-Polgár cultural zone, dated around or after 4600 BCE, {{was discovered in}} Ślęza, Wrocław County. It consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> long trapezoidal house accompanied by several post-built supporting structures. Among the large explored settlements of the Lengyel culture from the 4400-4000 BCE period, there is one in Brześć Kujawski, and another one in Osłonki, solidly fortified about 4200 BCE after an assault incident involving arson and murder, both located in the Kujawy region. At the Osłonki settlement nearly 30 trapezoidal houses and over 80 graves were located, some of them with many copper ornaments. The agricultural and construction activities of the communities centered on the two large settlements (hunting and fishing were also practiced) caused very likely an accumulation of environmental damage, which eventually forced them to abandon the area. 4th millennium BC constructions reinforced with ditches and palisades and ceramics molded into figural representations of the Lengyel-Polgár culture were located in Podłęże, Wieliczka County.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on June 3. It tracked westward across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean, and on June 15 it crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean. The system continued westward, and late on June 16 a low pressure area developed about 300miles (480km) southwest of San José, Costa Rica. At around 1200UTC on June 17, Dvorak classifications began on the disturbance, though initially its convection was broadly distributed and disorganized. The next day, however, an area of concentrated convection developed just south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Ships in the vicinity confirmed the development of a surface circulation within the system, while satellite imagery showed the development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> dense overcast. Based on its organization, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Three-E late on June 18 while located about 270miles (470km) southeast of Puerto Angel, Oaxaca in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Aintree-Eglinton Reserve, a {{grassed area}} {{covering}} , contains a cricket pitch, several practice runs and night lights for Australian rules football, which are utilised by local amateur and junior clubs. Within the reserve is the Hamersley Community Recreation Centre, first {{built in the}} 1970s as a community hall and opened {{in its present form}} on 22 April 1990. The centre is a small village area consisting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> pergola crossed with walking paths, flanked by four buildings: a sports hall with basketball courts and kiosk, an arts and crafts building, a community hall and function building hosting discos and other social events, and a purpose-built children's centre.

5|$|Along {{with the}} rising {{importance}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> administration arose {{a new class of}} educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh, and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration. As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh. This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150BC, is assumed to have caused the country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{importance}} of 'joint' warfare had been highlighted during Second World War when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands, the absence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> authority continued to result in poor co-ordination between the services in the post-war era, with each organising and operating {{on the basis of}} a different military doctrine. The need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the Australian military's experiences in the Vietnam War. In 1973, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Arthur Tange, submitted a report to the Government that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single department and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff.|$|E
5|$|Ambondro mahabo is a mammal {{from the}} middle Jurassic (about 167 million years ago) of Madagascar. The only species of the genus Ambondro, it is known from a fragmentary lower jaw with three teeth, {{interpreted}} as the last premolar and the first two molars. The premolar consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> cusp {{with one or two}} smaller cusps and a cingulum (shelf) on the inner, or lingual, side of the tooth. The molars also have such a lingual cingulum. They consist of two groups of cusps: a trigonid of three cusps at the front and a talonid with a main cusp, a smaller cusp, and a crest at the back. Features of the talonid suggest that Ambondro had tribosphenic molars, the basic arrangement of molar features also present in marsupial and placental mammals. It is the oldest known mammal with putatively tribosphenic teeth; {{at the time of its}} discovery it antedated the second oldest example by about 25 million years.|$|E

5|$|Balzac {{began using}} {{characters}} from earlier works in his 1835 novel Le Père Goriot, {{and made the}} technique a hallmark of his fiction. In the case of Z. Marcas, the narrator– Charles Rabourdin, whose identity is only revealed {{at the end of}} the story– is in fact the son <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> character from Balzac's 1837 tale La Femme supérieure. The title character of that story is married to Xavier Rabourdin, who is unjustly ignored for a promotion to the head of his civil service department. At the end of the La Femme supérieure, Rabourdin pledges to his wife that they will enjoy success in the world of business. His son's poverty in Z. Marcas is evidence of his failure.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1780s, a {{large number}} of {{prominent}} Americans called for the establishment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> mint to supply the United States with official coinage; all such proposals failed {{due in large part to}} lack of funds and opposition from individuals and groups who preferred that coins be struck by the individual states. Since there were no federal coins issued, the needs of the states were fulfilled by a variety of domestic and foreign coins and tokens, including Spanish eight-real coins (popularly known as Spanish dollars or pieces of eight).|$|E
5|$|Catherine's {{earliest}} {{building project}} was the château of Montceaux-en-Brie, near Paris, which Henry II gave her in 1556, {{three years before}} his death. The building consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> pavilion housing a straight staircase, and two wings with a pavilion at each end. Catherine wanted to cover the alley in the garden where Henry played pall mall, an early form of croquet. For this commission, Philibert de l'Orme built her a grotto. He set it on a base {{made to look like}} natural rock, from which guests could watch the games while taking refreshments. The work was completed in 1558 but has not survived. The château ceased {{to be used as a}} royal residence after 1640, and had fallen into ruin by the time it was demolished by revolutionary decree in 1798.|$|E
