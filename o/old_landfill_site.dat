40|$|ABSTRACT: Geosynthetic Products offer owners, engineers, and {{contractors}} {{a safe and}} economical solution to everyday engineering challenges and construction requirements. Used as replacements to natural materials, geosynthetic products include {{a wide range of}} functions such as filtration, drainage, separation and reinforcement requirements. During the summer of 2001 and 2002, the City of Hamilton and its engineers, Dillon Consulting Ltd., tendered a construction project to cover, collect leachate, and stabilize slopes on an <b>old</b> <b>landfill</b> <b>site,</b> which had been constructed adjacent to a creek. The challenge involved designing a veneer slope with geosynthetic products at slopes of 35 degrees while maintaining a natural landscape along the creek. The use of numerous geosynthetic products such as a Geosynthetic Clay Liner, Geomembranes, Geogrids, textiles, and erosion control blankets, were used to collect leachates, stabilize the slope along the existing creek, and to restrict the penetration of rainfall into the landfill to reduce further infiltration into the system. Used together, the geosynthetic products gave the owner and engineer a safe and economical solution to a contaminated site. This paper summarizes the design, construction, and performance to date of over a dozen geosynthetic products installed for the project. An update of the 2003 Construction season will be presented. 1...|$|E
30|$|For several years, the {{occurrence}} of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the aquatic environment has been {{recognized as one of}} the emerging issues in environmental risk assessment [1 - 4]. Pharmaceuticals used in human medical care are not completely eliminated in the human body and can enter the municipal sewage sludge system both as the parent compound and as their biologically active metabolites. These compounds have a large potential for unwanted effects on nontarget organisms in the environment. Several investigators have examined the removal of pharmaceutical compounds during the passage through municipal sewage treatment systems [5 - 8]. Effluent concentrations and elimination rates for different compounds vary significantly. Various pharmaceutical compounds have been detected in concentrations up to μg L− 1 in sewage effluents, downstream of sewage treatment plants and in surface and groundwater [2, 9, 10]. In addition to sewage treatment plants, <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> where unused drugs and different personal care products have been disposed may release these compounds into the environment. There are several <b>old</b> <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> that were established when the disposal of such compounds through garbage was tolerated, and drugs have been detected in leachates from such municipal landfills [11]. Leachates from <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> are also known to penetrate down to the groundwater causing pollution [12].|$|R

40|$|Landfills {{have been}} {{the most common form of}} waste disposal, and old {{landfills}} are present or in close proximity to most communities. Many old landfills, built before the environmental laws could properly regulating waste disposal, often not lined, are now considered potentially contaminated sites and can represent a severe environmental issue posing a long-term risk to health and the environment. In this paper a risk analysis procedure aimed at investigating the long-term risk of groundwater contamination posed by old Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) landfills was applied in combination with LandSim (Landfill Performance Simulation) model with the aim of obtaining an integrate tool to assist decision makers establishing priorities for remediation action. A case study was carried out at an <b>old</b> <b>landfill</b> <b>site</b> filled with MSW, the oldest of which dated back to 1970. Risk analysis was carried out according to international and Italian guidelines. The risk for groundwater was considered by comparing the concentration at the compliance point with the Italian regulatory limits (CSC contamination concentration threshold), whereas the risk for humans was based on maximum chronic population exposure. The adopted risk analysis approach, for old landfills, appears to be a key tool to assist decision makers in establishing priorities for remediation action.

40|$|In {{the frame}} of an {{environmental}} reorganisation plan of an <b>old</b> <b>landfill</b> <b>site</b> (northern Sardinia, Italy), an integrated geophysical survey was carried out to delineate the landfill borders, to determine the nature and physical characteristics of the host materials with special emphasis on outlining {{the distribution of the}} leachate and biogas, and to define the pattern of the bedrock. Landfills are amenable to geophysical investigations because they usually contain waste materials characterised by high electrical conductivities, high magnetic susceptibility, and low seismic velocities. Moreover, the relatively high resistivity values of the bedrock allow to delineate the landfill boundaries. Due to the complexity of the phenomena linked to waste disposals, a multi-methodological geophysical approach (Cossu et al., 1997, 2001; Green et al., 1999; De Iaco et al., 2000) proved to be the best procedure and probably the only one capable of giving a highly meaningful answer to the general characterisation of a waste body. It is worth stressing that when a multidisciplinary strategy is used, the ambiguities inherent in each method are greatly reduced. In particular, in the cited area a very detailed exploration was carried out with several geophysical techniques: frequency and time domain electromagnetism, very low frequency, geoelectrical and induced polarisation tomography, seismic refraction and tomography. An integrated analysis of the data from the entire exploration plan provided a very accurate physical an...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a novel resistivity method called Multi-Electrode resistivity technique (MERIT) {{that is used}} for high resolution imaging of complex geologic features at depth and near the edges of survey lines. The MERIT electrodes are especially shaped and designed to be self-driven using a robust-direct push technique. Measurements are taken using optimized arrays that are generated using {{a modified version of}} the “Compare-R” optimization algorithm. This work focused on both two-dimensional (MERIT 2 D) and three-dimensional (MERIT 3 D) applications of the buried array and show the relevance of the additional information gained by the addition of deep electrodes especially in sites with limited survey area. Numerical and laboratory studies are used to test and develop the technique and are later applied to image complex subsurface geologic structures on the field. The configuration of MERIT arrays brings some additional problems in terms the sensitivity of the deep MERIT arrays to a problem of non-uniqueness, mis-information, geometric error and resolution break between the two layers of electrodes. Multiple vertical resolution characteristic curves (RC curves) are analyzed to study the effect of array type, resistivity contrast, target resistivity and implant depth on the above-mentioned problems. Results show that MERIT measurements taken using standard dipole -dipole and wenner arrays along the surface and deep electrodes will strongly suffer from the problem of non-uniqueness or ambiguity while measurements taken using optimized arrays is suitable for MERIT configuration and will not suffer from any problem of ambiguity or non-uniqueness. Based on our result, a procedural guideline is developed to determine optimal MERIT implant depth and resolution cutoff that can be used for successful field implementation and for controlling misinformation during data interpretation. Numerical studies involving simple shapes and complex geometries mostly based on actual geological cross-sections from karst environments were used to compare the effectiveness of MERIT 2 D in terms its high depth resolution and is compared in detail with traditional 2 D and 3 D surface resistivity methods of equal foot prints. Similar comparison was made between MERIT 3 D technique and 3 D surface resistivity measurements. Results show that both methods achieve high depth resolution compared to their equivalent traditional resistivity methods. Laboratory experiment conducted using a complex analogue model mimicking actual sinkhole structure is used to test MERIT 2 D. Also laboratory experiment involving a 3 D printed plastic cave model mimicking an actual cave was conducted using MERIT 3 D approach. Both results show the promise of MERIT approach to image and solve complex geological structures or problems. Finally, the method is applied to collect field data in three case study sites involving complex karst related sinkhole structures and an <b>old</b> <b>landfill</b> <b>site.</b> The result shows the promising capability of the MERIT technique to study challenging geologic conditions with high depth resolution...|$|E

40|$|Eutrophication {{has become}} a {{considerable}} issue for managers of water bodies across Australia. Rapid urbanisation in the south-west of Western Australia is causing the eutrophication of many wetlands within the region. Lake Joondalup is a eutrophic, urban lake, located approximately 20 km north of Perth city. It comprises part of the Yellagonga Regional Park, having a high conservation value. The {{aim of this study}} was to provide managers of Lake Joondalup with information on the relative importance of different nutrient sources into the lake, thus enabling the development of appropriate management strategies. Additionally, a historical examination of available water quality data was conducted to determine the lake 2 ̆ 7 s current trajectory in relation to nutrients. The long-term trends occurring in Lake Joondalup were inferred with the use of information collected between 1973 - 2001 for total phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations. Relative importance of stormwater, groundwater and surface flow from adjoining swamps was investigated through sampling that occurred between May and August of 2004. A nutrient budget was then extrapolated based on the recent sampling and the use of literature. This budget was compared to a nutrient budget constructed in the mid 1980 s to determine changes. Long-term trends suggest that significant variation has occurred over the years, with nutrient concentrations increasing in the main section of the Jake and decreasing in the southern section. This was particularly prevalent for total phosphorus. However, whilst the two sections of the lake seem to be acting differently, the concentrations in the two regions are now quite similar, with both being equally polluted. This is in contrast to the 1980 s, when only the southern section showed significant levels of pollution. Surface flow from Beenyup Swamp was considered the major contributor of nutrients to the Lake, as has been identified in several prior studies. Contrary to previous beliefs stormwater was not found to have a significant effect on the nutrient status of Lake Joondalup, while the complexity of groundwater movement made quantification of sub-surface impacts difficult. Nonetheless this study indicates that an <b>old</b> <b>landfill</b> <b>site</b> east of the Lake appears to contaminate groundwater entering the lake, yet on aggregate a net loss of nutrients from the lake was identified through groundwater flow. It is recommended that the most appropriate management strategy for Lake Joondalup is to reduce nutrient contributions through surface flows from Beenyup Swamp. Considering the importance of Beenyup Swamp to the hydrology of Lake Joondalup it would be undesirable to restrict the flow from this source. Harvesting of macrophytes may be beneficial, though a study to better understand the sources of nutrients to the swamp is required. In addition, an investigation of the relative importance of groundwater is desirable to determine the net impact of this parameter. Thus, it was concluded that whilst effects of groundwater need further investigation, reductions in nutrient input from Beenyup Swamp should be the priority and would ultimately help to ensure the conservation of Lake Joondalup...|$|E
