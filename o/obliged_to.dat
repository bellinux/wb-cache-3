5|$|It {{is perhaps}} no {{accident}} that the factuality of the Italian Renaissance has been most vigorously questioned by those who are not <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> take a professional interest in the aesthetic aspects of civilization—historians of economic and social developments, political and religious situations, and, most particularly, natural science—but only exceptionally by students of literature and hardly ever by historians of Art.|$|E

5|$|The {{station at}} Chalfont Road was built with almost all {{facilities}} {{on the up}} side (the London-bound platform). As Chalfont St Giles, the largest nearby settlement, {{was on the other}} side of the tracks, most passengers travelling to and from the station were <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> take a lengthy detour from the single exit. A footpath across the tracks was added in 1925, but an approach road giving access to the station from the southern side of the railway line was not built until 1933. The station had three platforms; one platform in each direction on the London–Aylesbury line, and a bay platform alongside the up platform for trains to Chesham. A run-around loop was built to allow locomotives reversing in the bay platform always to be at the front of their trains. It was built outside the station, meaning locomotives reversing on the Chesham line were <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> push their trains out of the station before performing the manoeuvre.|$|E

5|$|Tähtinen {{concludes that}} Hindus have no misgivings about death penalty; their {{position}} is that evil-doers who deserve death should be killed, and that a king in particular is <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> punish criminals and should not hesitate to kill them, even if {{they happen to be}} his own brothers and sons.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli {{believed}} that the state governed with divine sanction. He {{believed that}} both {{the church and the}} state are placed under the sovereign rule of God.

He described a preference for an aristocracy over monarchic or democratic rule.|$|E
5|$|A {{by-election}} {{need not}} be held to fill a vacancy in any GRC triggered by the death or resignation of an MP, {{even if there are}} no other minority candidates in that GRC, or any other reason.

Assuming that such a situation does arise, the Prime Minister would be <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> call a by-election within a reasonable time, unless he intends to call a general election in the near future.|$|E

5|$|A large workhouse such as Whitechapel, {{accommodating}} {{several thousand}} paupers, employed {{a staff of}} almost 200; the smallest may only have had a porter and perhaps an assistant nurse {{in addition to the}} master and matron. A typical workhouse accommodating 225 inmates had a staff of five, which included a part-time chaplain and a part-time medical officer. The low pay meant that many medical officers were young and inexperienced. To add to their difficulties, in most unions they were <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> pay out of their own pockets for any drugs, dressings or other medical supplies needed to treat their patients.|$|E
5|$|A second auction was held, with {{bids for}} natural gas given equal weight to those wishing to {{transfer}} crude oil, although any natural gas bidder would be <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> maintain the oil pumping stations {{for use in a}} national emergency.

Its bid of $143,127,000 would make the disposal the largest sale of war-surplus property to the private sector following World War II.|$|E
5|$|A {{system of}} single weights and {{measures}} was introduced and in 1850 the Swiss franc became the Swiss single currency.
