5|$|Various beetles in the Bostrichoidea {{superfamily}} {{attack the}} dry, seasoned wood used as structural timber in houses {{and to make}} furniture. In most cases, it is the larvae that do the damage; these are invisible from {{the outside of the}} timber, but are chewing away at the wood in the interior of the item. Examples of these are the powderpost beetles, which attack the sapwood of hardwoods, and the furniture beetles, which attacks softwoods, including plywood. The damage has already been done by the time the adult beetles bore their way out, leaving neat round holes behind them. The first that a householder knows about the beetle damage is often when a chair leg breaks off <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> structural timber caves in. Prevention is through chemical treatment of the timber prior to its use in construction or in furniture manufacture.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry of mutualistic {{species is}} seen in coral reef fish, where the models, certain cleaner fish, are greatly {{disadvantaged}} {{by the presence of}} the mimic. Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin in a mutually beneficial cleaning symbiosis. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their mouths and gill cavities to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus). This wrasse, shown in the image cleaning a grouper of the genus Epinephelus, resides in coral reefs in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and is recognized by other fishes who then allow it to clean them. Its imposter, a species of blenny, lives in the Indian Ocean and not only looks like it in terms of size and coloration, but even mimics the cleaner's 'dance'. Having fooled its prey into letting its guard down, it then bites it, tearing off scales <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> fin before fleeing the scene. Fish grazed upon in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close between the two they become much more cautious of the model as well, such that both are affected. Due to victims' ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.|$|E

25|$|To {{achieve the}} inside-out configuration, the pipette is {{attached}} to the cell membrane as in the cell-attached mode, forming a gigaseal, and is then retracted to break off a patch of membrane {{from the rest of the}} cell. Pulling off a membrane patch often results initially in the formation of a vesicle of membrane in the pipette tip, because the ends of the patch membrane fuse together quickly after excision. The outer face of the vesicle must then be broken open to enter into inside-out mode; this may be done by briefly taking the membrane through the bath solution/air interface, by exposure to a low Ca2+ solution, or by momentarily making contact with a droplet of paraffin <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> cured silicone polymer.|$|E

25|$|Dry socket {{typically}} causes pain on {{the second}} to fourth day following a dental extraction. Other causes of post extraction pain usually occur immediately after the anesthesia/analgesia has worn off, (e.g., normal pain from surgical trauma or mandibular fracture) or has a more delayed onset (e.g., osteomyelitis, which typically causes pain several weeks following an extraction). Examination typically involves gentle irrigation with warm saline and probing of the socket to establish the diagnosis. Sometimes part of {{the root of the}} tooth <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> bone fractures off and is retained in the socket. This can be another cause of pain in a socket, and causes delayed healing. A dental radiograph (x-ray) may be indicated to demonstrate such a suspected fragment.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{main dish}} has been cooked, spices such as minced ginger and various pungent herbs may be added as a garnish, called tsuma.

25|$|Regardless of the {{controversy}} and the delay in relieving Bee, Jackson's brigade, which would thenceforth {{be known as the}} Stonewall Brigade, stopped the Union assault and suffered more casualties than any other Southern brigade that day; Jackson has since then been generally known as Stonewall Jackson.

His hand was struck by a bullet <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> shrapnel and he suffered a small loss of bone in his middle finger. He refused medical advice to have the finger amputated.

25|$|The name Glossop {{is thought}} to be of Anglo-Saxon origin, named during the Angles' {{settlement}} in the 7th century, and derived from Glott's Hop – where hop could mean a valley, a small valley in a larger valley system, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> land enclosed by marshes and Glott was probably a chieftain's name. Because of its size and location, Glossop had many definitions. The village of Glossop is now called Old Glossop. Howard Town and Milltown gained importance. They were named New Town and then Glossop. Local government reorganisations had caused the Glossopdale villages to be promoted to a municipal borough and then have that status removed. Land has been added to Glossop and other lands removed. From a small settlement it became an ancient parish, a manor, a borough, and a township. Currently, two county divisions in High Peak Borough, Derbyshire, have Glossop as part of their names.|$|E
25|$|Koledari {{prepared}} themselves during {{several days}} {{before the start of}} the koleda: they practiced the koleda songs, and made their masks and costumes. The masks could be classified into three types according to the characters they represented: the anthropomorphic, the zoomorphic (representing bear, cow, stag, goat, sheep, ox, wolf, stork, etc.), and the anthropo-zoomorphic. The main material from which they were produced was hide. The face, however, could be made separately out of a dried gourd shell <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> wood, and then sewn to hide so that the mask could cover all the head. The moustache, beard, and eyebrows were made with black wool, horsehair, or hemp fibers, and the teeth with beans. Zoomorphic and anthropo-zoomorphic masks might have white, black, or red painted horns attached to them. The costumes were prepared from ragged clothes, sheepskins with the wool turned outside, and calf hides. An ox tail with a bell fixed at its end was sometimes attached at the back of them.|$|E
25|$|When workers {{hunt for}} arthropods, they fly {{from side to}} side about half a meter off of the ground. Visual cues are used to {{determine}} where to search for prey, whereas olfactory cues are used to determine that prey is near, and elicit landing. Green and brown caterpillars are the most common prey for P. sericea. Once a caterpillar or other insect has been found, workers bite the insect behind the head. They will then drag the prey up onto a twig <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> grass, or will sometimes fly the insect to a different location; they do this in order to keep ants or other insects from stealing their prey. Once the insect is in a safe location, the wasp will malaxate the prey, or soften it by mixing it with a thinner substance, presumably saliva. The worker will then bring what it can back to the nest to feed other individuals. If prey is too large to bring back to the nest, foragers will leave the prey, and fly in side to side arcs back to the nest to recruit other workers to help carry the load.|$|E

25|$|Consequently, modernism in English {{remained}} {{in the role of}} an avant garde movement, depending on little presses and magazines and a small but dedicated readership. The key group to emerge during this time were the Objectivist poets, consisting of Louis Zukofsky, George Oppen, Charles Reznikoff, Carl Rakosi, Basil Bunting and Lorine Niedecker. The Objectivists were admirers of Stein, Pound and Williams and Pound actively promoted their work. Thanks to his influence, Zukofsky was asked to edit a special Objectivist issue of the Chicago-based journal Poetry in 1931 to launch the group. The basic tenets of Objectivist poetics were to treat the poem as an object and to emphasise sincerity, intelligence, and the poet's ability to look clearly at the world, and in this they can be viewed as direct descendants of the Imagists. Continuing a tradition established in Paris, Zukofsky, Reznikoff, and Oppen went on to form the Objectivist Press to publish books by themselves and by Williams. In his later work, Zukofsky developed his view of the poem as object to include experimenting with mathematical models for creating poems, producing effects similar {{to the creation of a}} Bach fugue <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> serial music.|$|E
