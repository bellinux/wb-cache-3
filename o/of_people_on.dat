5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in late 2009 by the National Addiction Centre (UK) found 41.3% of readers of Mixmag had used mephedrone {{in the last}} month, making it the fourth-most popular drug amongst clubbers. Of those, two thirds snorted the drug and the average dosage per session was 0.9g; the length of sessions increased as the dosage increased. Users who snorted the drug reported using more per session than those who took it orally (0.97g compared to 0.74g) and also reported using it more often (five days per month compared to three days per month). An Irish study <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> a methadone treatment program for heroin addicts found 29 of 209 patients tested positive for mephedrone usage.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{population}} density of Varanasi and {{the increasing number of}} tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for the pollution and pressures on infrastructure in the city, mainly the sewage, sanitation, and drainage components. Pollution of the Ganges is a particular source of worry because of the religious significance of the river, the dependence <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> it as a source of drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself. The sewage problem is exacerbated by the role of the Ganges in bathing and in river traffic, which is very difficult to control. Because of the sewage, people using local untreated water have higher risk of contracting a range of water-borne stomach diseases.|$|E

5|$|In 121 BC, Han forces {{expelled}} the Xiongnu from a vast territory {{spanning the}} Hexi Corridor to Lop Nur. They repelled a joint Xiongnu-Qiang invasion of this northwestern territory in 111 BC. In that year, the Han court established four new frontier commanderies in this region: Jiuquan, Zhangyi, Dunhuang, and Wuwei. The majority <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> the frontier were soldiers. On occasion, the court forcibly moved peasant farmers to new frontier settlements, along with government-owned slaves and convicts who performed hard labor. The court also encouraged commoners, such as farmers, merchants, landowners, and hired laborers, to voluntarily {{migrate to the}} frontier.|$|E
5|$|In February 1999, David Protess, a Northwestern University journalism professor, and his {{students}} were studying cases <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> death row. They discovered evidence related to Death Row inmate Anthony Porter that might help exonerate him. The students produced four affidavits and a videotaped statement that attributed guilt for the crime to another suspect. They obtained recantations by some witnesses of their testimony at trial. One witness claimed that he named Anthony Porter as a suspect only after police officers threatened, harassed and intimidated him into doing so.|$|E
5|$|There is a race {{prejudice}} {{that exists}} between the white and Negro races wherever the Negroes are found in large numbers.... Just this week the announcement comes {{as a shock to}} the people of Oklahoma that the Secretary of the Interior... has appointed a Negro from Kansas to come to Oklahoma and take charge of the supervision of the Indian schools of this State. There is no race <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> earth that has more antipathy for the Negro race than the Indian race, and yet these people, numbering many of the best citizens of this State and nation, are to be humbled and their prejudices and passions are to be increased by having this outrage imposed upon them... If your organization would interest itself to the extent of seeing that such outrages as this are not perpetrated against our people, there would be fewer lynchings in the South than at this time...|$|E

5|$|The video {{starts with}} Madonna {{coming to a}} ballet studio {{carrying}} a boombox. She switches it on as the clock ticking sound of the music starts. Wearing a pink leotard, Madonna starts gyrating to the music while doing warm up exercises. The scene interchanges with a group <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> the street who start dancing to the music while listening to a similar boombox. They also display aspects of the physical discipline Parkour, while climbing over buildings and jumping from staircases. As the song starts, Madonna dances to the music in the ballet studio. The second verse shows her continuing dancing while {{the people from the}} street take their boombox and board a taxi. Scenes are interspersed with people dancing in a Chinese restaurant and Parisian streets. In the meantime, Madonna finishes her workout in the ballet studio, drops her towel, changes her clothes and comes out on the street. The people on the taxi, leave it and take the Underground instead. After another round of dancing in the train, the intermediate music starts. Madonna is shown mingling with some dancers on a dance floor and riding on a boombox. As the song starts again, Madonna and the people from the street, who act as her background dancers, all dance on a Dance Dance Revolution machine in a gaming parlor. The video ends showing Madonna lying on the ballet studio floor. The video was nominated for five awards at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards including Best Female Video, Dance Video, Pop Video, Best Choreography and the Video of the Year award although it did not win any of them.|$|E
5|$|Titanic had a {{total of}} 20 lifeboats, {{comprising}} 16wooden boats on davits, 8 {{on either side of}} the ship, and 4 collapsible boats with wooden bottoms and canvas sides. The collapsibles were stored upside down with the sides folded in, and would have to be erected and moved to the davits for launching. Two were stored under the wooden boats and the other two were lashed atop the officers' quarters. The position of the latter would make them extremely difficult to launch, as they weighed several tons each and had to be manhandled down to the boat deck. On average, the lifeboats could take up to 68 people each, and collectively they could accommodate 1,178– barely half the number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> board and a third of the number the ship was licensed to carry. The shortage of lifeboats was not because of a lack of space nor because of cost. Titanic had been designed to accommodate up to 68lifeboats– enough for everyone on board– and the price of an extra 32lifeboats would only have been some , a tiny fraction of the $7.5 million that the company had spent on Titanic. In an emergency, lifeboats at the time were intended to be used to transfer passengers off the distressed ship and onto a nearby vessel. It was therefore commonplace for liners to have far fewer lifeboats than needed to accommodate all their passengers and crew, and of the 39British liners of the time of over , 33 had too few lifeboat places to accommodate everyone on board. The White Star Line desired the ship to have a wide promenade deck with uninterrupted views of the sea, which would have been obstructed by a continuous row of lifeboats.|$|E
