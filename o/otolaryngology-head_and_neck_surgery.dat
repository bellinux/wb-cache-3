40|$|Pulmonary embolus (PE) {{and deep}} venous {{thrombosis}} (DVT) are significant causes of morbidity and mortali-ty in patients after surgical procedures. It is estimated that 2. 5 million cases of DVT, 600, 000 cases of PE, and 200, 000 deaths caused by thromboembolic disease occur annually in the United States. 1 Between 5 % and 15 % of all deaths in acute-care hospitals are attributed to pulmonary embolism. 2, 3 The topic of DVT and PE has received little atten-tion in the otolaryngologyÐhead <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> <b>surgery</b> lit-erature.

40|$|Objective To {{summarize}} the developments of otorhinolaryngology head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> <b>surgery</b> locally <b>and</b> abroad {{in the recent}} five years,and to provide references for determining the development and research direction of otorhinolaryngology head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> <b>surgery</b> in the army in the future. Methods The method of intelligence survey was adopted in the current study. Information on the current development of otorhinolaryngology head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> <b>surgery</b> were collected <b>and</b> analyzed. The advancements of the above discipline and its basic application in studies,clinical examination,diagnosis,and treatment in China and its army were also summarized. Results Otorhinolaryngology head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> <b>surgery</b> has achieved rapid progress in China and has attained an advanced level in the world during the last five years. The army also attained great achievements in the basic application and clinical studies of otorhinolaryngology head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> <b>surgery.</b> Gene screening for military noise-induced deafness leads to good results. New advancements {{have been made in}} curing hair cell damage and nerve damage by stem cells,tissue engineering,and gene therapy. Operations of otology,neuro-otology,rhinology,and laryngopharyngeal head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> <b>surgery</b> have been geared toward minimal invasiveness and precision. The technology of cochlear implant has become mature and has been extensively adopted,which has lead to extremely positive significance to the recovery of those injured with severe deafness during and after the war. The treatment of malignant tumors in the head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> has also become single-case,from comprehensive treatment to individualized treatment. Conclusions Otorhinolaryngology head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> <b>surgery</b> in the army has taken the lead in the medical field in China. Some items are now in use worldwide. The army has kept track of the development of otorhinolaryngology head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> <b>surgery</b> during the 12 th five year period. Otorhinolaryngology head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> <b>surgery</b> has been combined with military features to develop advantageous disciplines and to focus on battle injury,military medication,regeneration of injured auditory nerves and hair cells,and genetic diagnosis and therapy of military noise-induced deafness,along with neuro-otology,rhinology,and laryngopharyngeal head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> <b>surgery</b> to develop minimally invasive and precise operations. Knowledge and experiences obtained from peacetime and wartime,as well as those from basic and clinical studies,have been combined to develop key disciplines with military features to attain internationally recognized advancement...|$|R
