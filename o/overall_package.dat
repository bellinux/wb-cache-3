25|$|One of the {{elements}} of the package will be the software package. The software package is a package in itself, because it consists of the different software components that together form the product. In contrast with the <b>overall</b> <b>package,</b> the software package is always a technical package in which all the files needed are combined in order to run the software product. Another concept of the software package is the version. This keeps track of the modifications made to the software product. By relating it to the software package the vendor and the customer are able {{to keep track of the}} functionality and properties of the product the customer is using.|$|E
500|$|Cauldron II {{was first}} {{released}} on the Commodore 64. [...] It {{was released in}} the following years on other systems and as re-releases. The game received praise, mainly for its audio-visuals, in video game magazines. Difficulty in handling the bouncing pumpkin's movement was a common complaint, although reviewers felt the <b>overall</b> <b>package</b> was of good value.|$|E
500|$|The SnapMap mode {{was also}} {{positively}} received with Hardcore Gamer Jordan Helm's noting the possibilities yet simplicity with its use, calling it an [...] "admirable feat". Matt Peckham of Time {{thought that the}} mode added further value to the <b>overall</b> <b>package</b> of the game. Matt Bertz of Game Informer commented upon the accessibility but criticized the lack of diverse settings and possible limitations when compared to a traditional community-based mod. James Davenport of PC Gamer compared it to the modification in the original games, which he views {{as one of the}} primary reasons why Doom is still a recognizable title. He was disappointed by the lack of mod support, though he nevertheless noted SnapMap for its simple use and variety of ideas already created by players.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the state}} of frame design and <b>overall</b> <b>packaging</b> was poor, Bimota {{concentrated}} initially on building high-quality motorcycles around existing engines. From the beginning they customised the top models of Suzuki, Honda and Kawasaki. During the late 1970s, Bimota also helped develop and build motorcycles branded as Lamborghinis. In the 1980s they also customised Yamaha and Ducati motorcycles.|$|R

500|$|Critics {{had mixed}} {{opinions}} regarding the <b>overall</b> <b>package.</b> Timothy J. Seppala from Engadget considered it [...] "a legitimate reason {{to buy an}} Xbox One", and Loveridge and Gies thought that Remedy had set a foundation for future storytelling by blending the two mediums together, making this game a unique title. Reeves thought that the game had the best gameplay and storytelling of all other Remedy games. Totilo added that the game innovates with the TV show, and that it makes the title something [...] "extraordinary". Martin Robinson from Eurogamer concluded that the game has more style than substance, but recognized the title's uniqueness. Both Houghton and Gerstmann agreed {{that it is an}} ambitious project, However, Gerstmann was disappointed that the elements did not connect well enough and Houghton felt that the complicated format dragged down the game as they were never combined together cohesively.|$|E
500|$|Publications {{dedicated}} to the ZX Spectrum platform considered the inclusion of The Evil Dead with the ZX Spectrum release a positive aspect that added value to the <b>overall</b> <b>package.</b> The game's difficulty was a common complaint. Computer Gamer, Crash, and ZX Computing commented that playing the game with limited lives was very challenging. Retro Gamers Craig Grannell described the game as [...] "unforgiving", citing difficulty landing and excessive precision required in the flying and platforming segments respectively. Following the success of Cauldron, Palace released a direct sequel, , in 1986. The game is set after {{the events of the}} first game, and features a bouncing pumpkin that survived the witch's ascension to power. Players navigate the pumpkin around a castle in search of the Witch Queen to enact revenge. Cauldron was later re-released along with its sequel as a compilation title on Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum computers. The commercial success of the two Cauldron games prompted Palace to give Brown more creative freedom for his following project, [...]|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{generally}} had {{a positive}} opinion on the package. Bertz thought that the game's multiplayer design had laid a great foundation for the game, {{but it was not}} taken advantage of due to the small number of game modes. Leack felt that Sieges tight focus on tactical gameplay had [...] "provided something unlike any other game on the market". Butterworth found the game very unique and that there was [...] "nothing else like it" [...] when he put aside the game's minor annoyances. Griffin wrote that the title felt very fresh, as most games in the market did not value tactics. Davenport similarly praised the game for being very concentrated and making no compromises on gameplay design, which in turn make the title one of the best tactical multiplayer shooters on the market. Gies recognized the game's potential but thought that they were overshadowed by the game's numerous technical annoyances, frustrating progression system and its lack of content. Robinson was impressed by the game's multiplayer mode, and that the <b>overall</b> <b>package</b> could be considered as the year's best multiplayer game. However, he questioned Ubisoft for releasing the game with so little content while still selling it at full-price.|$|E
5|$|Upon its release, The Albums 2000-2010 {{received}} positive reception {{from most}} of the reviewers, who complimented the <b>overall</b> <b>packaging</b> of the box set and her releases through Parlophone.

The box set charted on the UK Albums Chart at number 37, and on the Scottish Albums Chart at number 40.|$|R
5000|$|The Music Corporation of America (MCA), under Lew Wasserman, was the [...] "packager" [...] of the series, {{providing}} {{stars who}} would not ordinarily appear on American television, such as Alec Guinness and Rex Harrison at reduced rates, in exchange for an <b>overall</b> <b>packaging</b> fee for the entire series paid to MCA. Wasserman was also the agent for Alfred Hitchcock, who directed one Startime episode, [...] "Incident at a Corner" [...] (aired April 5, 1960).|$|R
50|$|The {{album cover}} is a {{component}} of the <b>overall</b> <b>packaging</b> of an album. Especially in the case of vinyl records with cardboard sleeves, these packages are prone to wear and tear, although wear and tear does often take place to some degree on covers contained within plastic cases. A variety of treatments could be applied to improve both their appearance and durability, such as clear plastic wrap. Many products have been available for the storage of vinyl albums, often clear plastic sleeves.|$|R
500|$|Senator Henry Clay, a Whig, {{hoped to}} put the slavery {{question}} to rest with {{what became known as}} the Compromise of 1850, which would give some victories to both slaveholders and abolitionists, and gained the support of his fellow Whig, Webster. With the proposal stalled in the Senate, Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas led an effort to split it into separate bills so that each legislator could vote against the parts his state opposed without endangering the <b>overall</b> <b>package.</b> This was done, and the bills passed, to be signed by President Millard Fillmore (who had succeeded Taylor after the president's death earlier in 1850). Pierce strongly supported the compromise, giving a well-received speech in December 1850 pledging himself to [...] "The Union! Eternal Union!" [...] The same month, the Democratic candidate for governor, John Atwood, issued a letter opposing the Compromise, and Pierce helped to recall the state convention and remove Atwood from the ticket. The fiasco would compromise the election for the Democrats, who lost several races. Still, Pierce's party retained its control over the state, and was well positioned for the upcoming presidential election.|$|E
500|$|GameSpot {{commented that}} the concept of mixing the serious {{elements}} of Final Fantasy with the lighter elements of Disney seemed impossible, but was pulled off quite well. Because of that they awarded Kingdom Hearts [...] "Best Crossover Since Capcom vs. SNK" [...] in their 2002 Best and Worst of the Year awards. GameSpy noted that the periodic departure from the main plot into the Disney side stories was disappointing, and when the original plot builds to a climax, [...] "the story fails to gel thanks to a confusing mish-mash of vague terms and symbolism that probably made more sense in the director's head than in this final product." [...] Aside from the plot, they stated that the <b>overall</b> <b>package</b> was worth playing through to the end. G4TV awarded it [...] "Best Story" [...] at their 2003 G-Phoria awards show. Fan response was also positive; Kingdom Hearts was voted as the 19th best game of all-time by readers of the Japanese magazine Famitsu, 16th by the users of website GameFAQs, and 92nd by IGN users. Kingdom Hearts ranked ninth on IGN's most recent [...] "Top 25 PS2 Games of All Time" [...] list. It was also a nominee for the Best Game Award from the [...] for 2001-2002. In the making of the 2004 video game Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel the developers, Racjin, looked at other titles for inspiration, particularly Kingdom Hearts when making the game.|$|E
500|$|After its cancellation, Publishers Weeklys Heidi MacDonald {{reported}} that the common response she saw from fans was that [...] "everyone liked it but nobody paid for it". She noted that many fans expressed sorrow over the magazine's demise while indicating {{that they did not}} subscribe to it. Katherine Dacey, the former senior manga editor for PopCultureShock, remarked that the magazine had offered [...] "just the right mixture of new stories, continuing series, and articles" [...] and praised it for having a [...] "funky, DIY vibe". The staff of the School Library Journal called the magazine [...] "one of a kind" [...] and felt that its loss would leave a void for female fans, a generally under-acknowledged group of comic and manga readers. Staff member Brigid Alverson felt Shojo Beat was a great <b>overall</b> <b>package</b> that [...] "featured intelligent articles that allowed the reader to be enthusiastic about Japanese pop culture without being geeky" [...] making it distinct from other magazines for girls that were normally [...] "filled with brainless celebrity stories or service articles tied to commercial products". Other participants praised the magazine's fashion articles for its educational articles on Japanese culture and for featuring girls of a variety of body types wearing affordable fashions. Two staffers questioned Viz's decision to drop the magazine and wondered if the company had unrealistically expected the magazine to have the same circulation numbers as Shonen Jump.|$|E
5|$|After its release, The Complete Studio Albums (1983–2008) {{received}} mixed reception from reviewers, who complimented the <b>overall</b> <b>packaging</b> {{of the box}} set, but {{hoped that}} the record label would have included Madonna's other popular songs {{that had not been}} on the original studio albums. The box set charted in multiple nations including Croatia, Finland, France, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom. It entered the top-ten of the Japanese Oricon album chart. The same week, MDNA was also present in the top-ten, making Madonna the first female artist from a Western country to have two albums in the chart's top-ten.|$|R

500|$|Guitar Hero III Mobile {{was well}} {{received}} upon its release. IGN considered {{it to be}} a [...] "successful adaptation" [...] of the Guitar Hero games to the cellphone keypad. They commented that while it may be tricky to download the songs for the game, requiring the user to be persistent during the download, the sound quality was excellent and the simplification down to three buttons from five makes the game [...] "accessible to anybody with even a passing curiosity." [...] CNET praised the quality of the sound and animations, as well as the ease of play. Cell Play referred to the game as [...] "the true mobile port of rock," [...] and praised the level of difficulty accomplished with the three button setup. They considered the shortened song length a negligible downside compared to the <b>overall</b> <b>package.</b> 1UPs review criticized the compact layout that led to hand cramps, and that the limited space on the mobile version only allowed two songs to be stored at a time. 1UP also lamented the shorted versions of the songs given the outstanding audio quality achieved on the mobile platform; their review summarized their experience as [...] "As a literal interpretation of the Guitar Hero formula, there was apparently no room to alter the game to emphasize the strengths of the mobile platform." [...] Guitar Hero III Mobile won two awards at the Qualcomm 2008 BREW Developers Conference for [...] "Best Game" [...] and [...] "People's Choice Award". The game has been downloaded by users 2.5 million times, with both Verizon and Hands-On Mobile claiming that over 250,000 songs are played a day on the platform.|$|E

In January 2016, it {{was reported}} that the NFL was considering splitting the Thursday Night Football package across multiple broadcasters in tandem with the possibility of expanding the <b>overall</b> <b>package</b> to 17 games. It was also reported that ESPN and Turner Sports were not interested in the package due to its short-term nature, and that Fox was attempting to outbid CBS.|$|E
5000|$|The Dugu museum models' {{packaging}} {{is intriguing}} and apparently done to mimic other 1:43 scale modelers, {{but also to}} be appropriate for museum sales. The Cisitalia's box panels alternate in blue and yellow {{with the name of}} the museum on the blue sides. The round seal of the museum appears on the end flaps with a representation of the 1899 'first' FIAT. The flat yellow sides of the box show the Cisistalia in profile and the opposite side names the car with bookman-like type font in blue.

2500|$|GameSpot's Jeff Gertsmann {{scored the}} console {{versions}} 7.2 out of 10, writing [...] "the game's strong production values aren't {{backed up by}} an equally compelling story or game." [...] He called Nicholas Kang [...] "completely unlikeable" [...] and [...] "an unnecessarily cocky jerk." [...] However, he also wrote, [...] "in terms of its presentation, True Crime delivers quite well. The graphics are very sharp and are most impressive when you're out on the road. Los Angeles looks startlingly realistic, {{right down to the}} maze of freeway on- and off-ramps." [...] He concluded [...] "True Crime is a game that simply lacks polish and, in some cases, feels unfinished. It makes decent attempts with its different styles of gameplay, but none of them are particularly well done." [...] He scored the PC version 6.3 out of 10, writing [...] "the game's transition from console to PC wasn't handled as smoothly as you might have expected, thus leaving a game that was already a little uneven feeling a little broken in some spots." [...] He called the controls [...] "pretty terrible" [...] and argued [...] "the fact that the PC version doesn't have any sort of gamepad support certainly doesn't help." [...] He was also critical of the graphics, writing [...] "True Crime looks like a PlayStation 2 game that's been ported up, touched up a little bit, and shipped." [...] He called the multiplayer mode [...] "ill-conceived," [...] arguing [...] "the online mode actually detracts from the <b>overall</b> <b>package</b> rather than enhancing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the album}} {{attracted}} criticism {{for the production}} and certain material, alongside Minogue's lack of innovation. Chris Bosnan from Consequence of Sound graded it C+, and exclaimed that the <b>overall</b> <b>package</b> represented [...] "chameleonic" [...] qualities and ended [...] "This eclecticism yields a booming, fun pop record that is refreshing by not attempting to be anything other, though that same inessentialism keeps the record from reaching transcendence." [...] However, he criticized the second half for its [...] "boisterous" [...] production and felt it [...] "lost momentum", apart fromm the track [...] "Fine". Annie Zalenski from The A.V. Club was less enthusiastic, who gave it C–. She felt the material [...] "drain" [...] Minogue's original pop sound, and said [...] "Kiss Me Once is a disappointing record that tries too hard to mold Minogue into something she’s not." [...] Lydia Jenkins from New Zealand Herald awarded the record three stars, and felt majority of the content was unoriginal but highlighted [...] "Into the Blue" [...] as [...] "half-decent", [...] "Million Miles" [...] and [...] "Fine" [...] as [...] "club fillers", and [...] "Sexy Love" [...] as a rip-off from the song [...] "California Gurls" [...] by American singer Katy Perry. Kevin Ritchie from Now Toronto gave it two marks out of five, and labelled it [...] "bad". He criticized {{the second half of}} the album, and felt majority of the songs like [...] "Sexercize" [...] were [...] "dated" [...] yet [...] "overproduced" [...] and the sound was [...] "murky". Philip Matusavage from MusicOMH gave it two stars, and wrote scathingly [...] "It’s crushingly disappointing, then, to find that Kiss Me Once is perhaps her most anonymous offering to date."

2500|$|The eighteenth {{conference of}} the parties held in Doha, Qatar, 2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference, yielded minor to modest results. [...] At the 2012 Doha climate change talks, Parties to the Kyoto Protocol agreed to an {{extension}} of the Kyoto Protocol to 2020. Participants in the extension to the Kyoto Protocol have taken on targets for the period 20132020, and include Australia, the European Union, {{and a number of other}} developed countries. Canada, which withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol in 2011, and the United States—which never ratified the Kyoto Protocol—have been joined by New Zealand, Japan, Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine who have stated that they would not sign up to a second Kyoto Protocol commitment period or extension due lack of commitments from the developing world which today include the world's largest carbon dioxide emitters. [...] Japan and New Zealand also added that their country's CO2 emissions are minor when compared to the emissions of China, The United States, and the European Union. These defections place significant pressures on the UNFCCC process which to date has not been able to curtail carbon dioxide emissions, whose latest Kyoto Protocol extension only accounts for 15% of greenhouse gas emissions, and whose process is seen by some as slow, cumbersome, expensive and an inefficient use of taxpayer money: in the UK alone the climate change department has taken over 3,000 flights over the course of two years at a cost to the taxpayer of over ₤1,500,000. The outcome of the Doha talks has received a mixed response, with small island states critical of the <b>overall</b> <b>package.</b> Other results of the conference include a timetable for a global agreement to be adopted by 2015 which includes all countries.|$|E
