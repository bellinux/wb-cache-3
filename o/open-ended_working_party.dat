40|$|Two <b>working</b> <b>parties,</b> the Working Party on Tuna Tagging in the Pacific and Indian Oceans and the Working Party on Tuna Tagging in the Atlantic and Adjacent Seas, {{were formed}} by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAD) of the United Nations in 1966 (Anonymous, 1966 c). The conveners of these <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> were Dr. James Joseph of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) and Mr. FrankJ. Mather, III, of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). In 1969 it was {{recommended}} that the <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> direct their attention toward billfishes, as well as tunas (Anonymous, 1969 h: 5). One report (Joseph and <b>working</b> <b>party,</b> 1969) was published by the Pacific and Indian Oceans group and two (Mather and <b>working</b> <b>party,</b> 1969 and 1972) were published by the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas group. Each of the three <b>working</b> <b>party</b> reports included a bibliography of tuna and billfish tagging. The compiler of this bibliography, beginning in 1970, prepared numerous memoranda {{to the members of}} the <b>working</b> <b>party,</b> most of which included lists of papers on tuna and billfish tagging which had come to his attention, either directly or through members of the <b>working</b> <b>party.</b> The bibliographies in the three <b>working</b> <b>party</b> reports and the lists of references in the memoranda form the basis for the present bibliography...|$|R

50|$|Work of {{the canal}} was {{undertaken}} by weekend <b>working</b> <b>parties,</b> including members of the S&WCS, the Dudley Tunnel Society and the Coventry Canal Society. A progress report issued by the IWA in April 1965 ultimately {{led to the formation}} of a publication called Navvies Notebook, which informed people about what was happening. It allowed volunteers to be drawn from a wider area, and in 1967, a record 45 people participated in a weekend <b>working</b> <b>party</b> on the canal. The canal was opened to through navigation again in May 1967. Following that success British Waterways went on to accept similar restoration <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> across the canal system.|$|R

40|$|In {{the summer}} of 1982, the ICLCUA CAFS Special Interest Group defined three subject areas for <b>working</b> <b>party</b> activity. These were: 1) {{interfaces}} with compilers and databases, 2) end-user language facilities and display methods, and 3) text-handling and office automation. The CAFS SIG convened one <b>working</b> <b>party</b> to address the first subject with the following terms of reference: 1) review facilities and map requirements onto them, 2) "Database or CAFS" or "Database on CAFS", 3) training needs for users to bridge to new techniques, and 4) repair specifications to cover gaps in software. The <b>working</b> <b>party</b> interpreted the topic broadly as the data processing professional's, rather than the end-user's, view of and relationship with CAFS. This report {{is the result of}} the <b>working</b> <b>party's</b> activities. The report content for good reasons exceeds the terms of reference in their strictest sense. For example, we examine QUERYMASTER, which is deemed to be an end-user tool by ICL, from both the DP and end-user perspectives. First, this is the only interface to CAFS in the current SV 201. Secondly, it is necessary for the DP department to understand the end-user's interface to CAFS. Thirdly, the other subjects have not yet been addressed by other active <b>working</b> <b>parties...</b>|$|R

A <b>working</b> <b>party</b> was set up in 1973 and several senior Fellows of the Institute of Marketing subsequently helped gain the support of the Court of Aldermen in the City of London for establishment of a Guild. Reginald Bowden, chairman of the <b>working</b> <b>party,</b> became Founder Master, serving from 1975 to 1978. On 14 April 1978 letters patent were presented to the Guild of Marketors and it became a livery company.

The <b>working</b> <b>party</b> then developed consensus on a standard set of properties for instruments to measure these attributes. Existing instruments in the field of rheumatology were ascertained by literature review and by contact with experts in the field.
