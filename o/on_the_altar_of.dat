Rain dissolves some of the iron oxide and thus streaks Zion's cliffs red (the red streak seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Altar</b> <b>of</b> Sacrifice is a famous example).

5|$|In {{order to}} protect {{themselves}} and their livestock against malevolent elves, Scandinavians could use a so-called Elf cross (Alfkors, Älvkors or Ellakors), which was carved into buildings or other objects. It existed in two shapes, one was a pentagram {{and it was still}} frequently used in early 20th-century Sweden as painted or carved onto doors, walls and household utensils in {{order to protect}} against elves. The second form was an ordinary cross carved onto a round or oblong silver plate. This second kind of elf cross was worn as a pendant in a necklace and in order to have sufficient magic it had to be forged during three evenings with silver, from nine different sources of inherited silver. In some locations it also had to be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> a church for three consecutive Sundays.|$|E

5|$|After {{the western}} {{portion of the}} Cuchumatanes fell to the Spanish, the Ixil and Uspantek Maya were {{sufficiently}} isolated to evade immediate Spanish attention. The Uspantek and the Ixil were allies and in 1529, {{four years after the}} conquest of Huehuetenango, Uspantek warriors were harassing Spanish forces and Uspantán was trying to foment rebellion among the K'iche'. Uspantek activity became sufficiently troublesome that the Spanish decided that military action was necessary. Gaspar Arias, magistrate of Guatemala, penetrated the eastern Cuchumatanes with sixty Spanish infantry and three hundred allied indigenous warriors. By early September he had imposed temporary Spanish authority over the Ixil towns of Chajul and Nebaj. The Spanish army then marched east toward Uspantán itself; Arias then received notice that the acting governor of Guatemala, Francisco de Orduña, had deposed him as magistrate. Arias handed command over to the inexperienced Pedro de Olmos and returned to confront de Orduña. Although his officers advised against it, Olmos launched a disastrous full-scale frontal assault on the city. As soon as the Spanish began their assault they were ambushed from the rear by more than two thousand Uspantek warriors. The Spanish forces were routed with heavy losses; many of their indigenous allies were slain, and many more were captured alive by the Uspantek warriors only to be sacrificed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> their deity Exbalamquen. The survivors who managed to evade capture fought their way back to the Spanish garrison at Q'umarkaj.|$|E

In 1919, an Annual Mass and Solemn Outdoor Procession of the Relics was held at St Chad's Cathedral in Birmingham. This observance continues to the present, on the Saturday nearest to his Feast Day, 2 March.|$|E
25|$|The Cross of Sacrifice is {{considered}} one of the great pieces of war-related art. Its enduring popularity, historian Allen Frantzen says, is because it is both simple and expressive, its abstraction reflecting the modernity people valued after the war. Fabian Ware argued that its greatness was because its symbolism is so purposefully vague: To some, it is a Christian cross; to others, the stone is irrelevant and the sword itself is the cross; and to others, the artwork symbolizes those who sacrificed their lives to the sword. The theme of sacrifice is commonly seen in the piece. Jeroen Geurst points out that Lutyens' War Stone unsettlingly brings to mind images of soldiers sacrificed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> war, while Blomfield's cross speaks about self-sacrifice and the saving grace of Jesus Christ's sacrifice.|$|E

25|$|By 1633, {{housing to}} the rear of the sacristy had been constructed, using wood and {{recycled}} elements from Furnas; they built a corridor and five cells that accommodated the brothers and two priests. The house of the original hermit and other dependencies were transformed into a pantry and refectory. Meanwhile, towards the coast they built a kitchen and other spaces. When completed, on 17 November 1633, the blessed sacrament from Furnas, which was saved from the fires, was placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> Nossa Senhora da Conceição; flanking the tabernacle, the clergy placed the images of Nossa Senhora da Conceição (from the hermitage) and Nossa Senhora da Consolação (also brought from the Furnas Valley). Meanwhile, the brothers constructed two niches over the altar, and placed images of Saint Peter and Mary Magadalene, while in smaller niches other saints and crucifixes were placed. The following year the body of Father Diogo da Madre de Deus of Furnas was brought from the Vale de Cabaços, and buried in a tomb within the chancel. But, by the end of December, the chamber was reopened and the bones were deposited in a stone box and placed to the right of the altar's credenza. In 1635, an image of Nossa Senhora das Dores was already located in the presbytery.|$|E

25|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19th century Pan-Slavic {{language}} projects were mostly the domain of Slovenes and Croats. In this era of awakening national consciousness, the Russians were the only Slavs who had their own state; other Slavic peoples inhabited large, mostly non-Slavic states, and clear borders between the various nations were mostly lacking. Among the numerous efforts at creating written standards for the South Slavic languages there were also efforts at establishing a common South Slavic language, Illyrian, that might also serve as a literary language for all Slavs in the future. Of special importance is the work of Matija Majar (1809–1892), a Slovenian Austroslavist who later converted to Pan-Slavism. In 1865 he published Uzajemni Pravopis Slavjanski ("Mutual Slavic Orthography"). In this work, he postulated that the best way for Slavs to communicate with other Slavs was taking own language as a starting point and then modifying it in steps. First, he proposed changing the orthography of each individual language into a generic ("mutual") Pan-Slavic orthography, subsequently he described a grammar that was based on comparing the five major Slavic languages of his days: Old Church Slavonic, Russian, Polish, Czech and Serbian. Apart from a book about the language itself, Majar also used it for a biography of Cyril and Methodius and for a magazine he published in the years 1873–1875, Slavjan. A fragment in the language can still be seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> Majar's church in Görtschach. Other Pan-Slavic language projects were published in the same period by the Croatian Matija Ban, the Slovenes Radoslav Razlag and Božidar Raič, as well as the Bulgarian from Macedonia Grigor Parlichev – all based on the idea of combining Old Church Slavonic with elements from the modern South Slavic languages.|$|E

Reconstruction of the choir area began in 1979 using the same materials as existed before the fire.

500|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{identified}} {{elements within}} the story that he believed reflected recurring themes within The Adventures of Tintin. He thought that the appearance of Rascar Capac's jewels reflected Hergé's use of jewellery as a theme throughout the series, and that the scene in which Tintin commands the sun god to do his bidding reflects a wider theme throughout the series in which [...] "sacred authority" [...] manifests through voice. The scene in which Haddock causes an avalanche of snow by sneezing reflected what McCarthy considered a wider theme {{of the danger of}} sound, while Zorrino's decision to stay among the Inca was interpreted as a reflection of a wider theme of adoption. Commenting on the execution scene, McCarthy believed that it represented Haddock being [...] "sacrificed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> his own illegitimacy", a concept that he felt had been echoed throughout the series.|$|E
