Using conceptual analysis to investigate the meanings of multicultural education, the study found that the concept as developed in North America includes such elements as intercultural education, multiethnic education, minority education, human rights education, anti-racist education, democratic education, political education, education for social justice and peace education. These supporting meanings were found to have both distinctiveness yet also <b>overlapping</b> <b>value</b> associations.

30|$|Compute inheritance: The {{goal is to}} {{determine}} inheritance relationships between namespaces. An ABAC model is said {{to meet the requirements}} of full inheritance if the inheritance relation holds between every two namespaces in the system. Guo et al. have referred to this property as completeness in the context of RBAC (Guo et al. 2008). On the basis of the property of full inheritance, we define an isAncestor(ns 1,ns 2) function. This function compares two namespaces ns 1 and ns 2 with respect to their attributes; ns 1 is an ancestor of ns 2 if the attributes of ns 1 is a subset of the attributes of ns 2. The intuition is to define a parent-child relation between elements, i.e., namespace, such that a parent namespace contains attributes common between its children. Here, attributes comparison is done according to their short names and values. For strict inheritance, attributes a 1 and a 2 are considered equivalent if they have identical name and value set. On the other hand, under simple inheritance, a 1 and a 2 are considered as equivalent if they have a common name and <b>overlapping</b> <b>value</b> set. To generate a graph-like ABAC structure, each namespace is mapped to its parents using the function, isAncestor, as shown in Algorithm 4 lines 16 - 25. The predefined element, i.e. “subject” (or “object” in the case of object groups) is referred to as main namespace and is assigned as a parent of namespaces that have no parents, lines 24 - 25 in Algorithm 4. All other elements —e.g., nurse, lab technician, employee etc. in this example— are descendants of this element. In the special case where two elements are equivalent, i.e., have similar sets of attributes, the elements are consolidated on one namepace, lines 8 - 12 Algorithm 4. The assigned name of the new namepace is the least common Hypernym 2 of the two underlying elements, obtained using WordNet (Miller 1995).|$|E
40|$|Thermokarst lakes are {{characteristic}} landscape features in Arctic permafrost regions and are relevant emitters {{of the greenhouse}} gas methane (Walter et al., 2006). A major pathway for methane emissions from these lakes is through bubbling (ebullition) from discrete seeps. An accurate assessment of the actual emission rates of CH 4 from thawed organic-rich talik sediments under thermokarst lakes is challenging due to poor accessibility and monitoring complexities concerning the spatially and temporally variable behavior of ebullition. In early winter, when lake surfaces start to freeze, or alternatively in late winter, the days before thawing sets in, a snow free ice cover reveals trapped gas-pockets and open hotspots of methane seeps. The detection and characterization of distinct ice-trapped CH 4 bubbles and bubble clusters, which depend on differing methane emission rates, is possible by field and remote sensing surveys of the lake ice cover during a short time window for image acquisition with ideal ice and snow conditions (Lindgren et al., 2015). In this work we aim to generate spatially very high resolution orthophoto mosaics using low altitude aerial imagery from multiple years to provide a set of high quality baseline imagery for characterization of ebullition features in thermokarst lake ice cover in the Fairbanks region, Interior Alaska. For our image processing, we relied on photogrammetric Structure-from-Motion (SfM) technology, which builds on image-based three-dimensional surface reconstruction algorithms. We applied this technique to large sets of overlapping aerial images using the workflow presented in Fig 1 and the software Agisoft PhotoScan Professional™. In a first step, the software analyzes input photos and detects features that are stable under variable viewpoint and lighting conditions. As a result, a descriptor for each point based on its local neighborhood is obtained and serves for detecting identical tie points across photos. Automated feature detection and matching are then performed using software-internal algorithms comparable to the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) approach. Internal and external camera positions are estimated on basis of bundle- adjustment algorithms. For dense point cloud and mesh construction the software provides several processing methods depending on the final product (orthophoto, pointcloud, digital surface model – DSM), data size (number of photos and resolution), and image acquisition mode (terrestrial vs. airborne, horizontal vs. oblique). For texturing, the reconstructed surface is divided into fragments and blending is applied to generate a texture atlas. We applied this full processing chain to a large set of 2601 images acquired during airborne flight campaigns with unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) and small aircrafts over several thermokarst lakes in the Fairbanks region in April 2012 and October of 2008, 2013 and 2014. In addition, aerial imagery of lakes in an abandoned gravel pit were gathered for comparison to thermokarst lakes and processed the same way. The 2601 aerial images were acquired at mean flight altitudes of 42 m. a. s. l. (UAV) and 327 - 606 m. a. s. l. (airplane). The images were grouped into seven regions covering sets of target lakes and {{provided the basis for}} 23 orthophoto mosaics. The number of images per mosaic ranged between 9 and 585. About 15 ground control points (GCPs) were equally distributed over the covered area for georeferencing. We achieved a ground resolution of 0. 02 m/pixel to 0. 12 m/pixel, a DSM resolution of 0. 03 m/pixel to 0. 24 m/pixel, and a point density of about 19 to 1849 points per m², depending strongly on actual flight height and photo resolution. Furthermore, the accuracy for surface reproduction is augmented by increasing image overlap with best results achieved when at least nine photos overlap. In one specific case, when image acquisition was conducted within a low flight altitude of 42 m. a. s. l. the SfM-method failed to align five overlapping images {{in the center of a}} thermokarst lake (Goldstream Lake) due to the absence of detectable ice surface features (such as bubbles or cracks) underneath the ice cover. The placement of temporary markers in the misaligned images still did not result in a sufficient matching quality; hence these unaligned photos were not taken into account for further processing. Future field campaigns with UAVs at low flight altitudes over lake ice should therefore include installation of ground control points across very homogeneous surfaces. Inhomogeneous or changing illumination conditions during a flight campaign could also lead to poorer photo alignment due to false corner and edge detection. Orthomosaics consisting of images taken under changing illumination situations (e. g. sunrise, sunset) may result in irregular color parametrization. The final orthomosaics are of high quality and can be used in further studies aiming at the identification, mapping, and quantification of methane ebullition features in the lake ice. In particular, the detection and characterization of different methane bubble cluster types is enhanced by the very high resolution of the orthophotos. In a further step, the estimation of whole-lake ebullition seep fluxes and the year-to-year development of ebullition seep features seem feasible. Additionally, it would be of major interest to test the practicability and accuracy of SfM generated high resolution repeat DSMs for detecting and quantifying thermoerosion at lake margins. For this, filtering vegetation, assigning an <b>overlapping</b> <b>value</b> to the point cloud, and evaluating the error of photogrammetric data is essential. Direct cloud-to-cloud or cloud-tomesh distance measurements and horizontal displacement fields from tracking features could be applied for broader analysis. The presented investigations show, that using SfM within Agisoft PhotoScan Professional™ for processing aerial imagery is a suitable method to generate high resolution orthophoto mosaics that subsequently can be used to characterize ice-trapped ebullition bubbles and bubble clusters on thermokarst lake ice cover. The new dimension of information gain due to the very high resolution within centimeter range in orthophotos, point clouds, and DSMs using SfM offers new insights for better understanding biogeochemical and geomorphological processes in periglacial environments, in particular processes related to thermokarst dynamics such as lake methane ebullition or shore erosion.

40|$|Long {{before the}} {{existence}} of today’s computer, information and communication technologies, the design of current energy grids has been set. Nowadays, ‘conventional’ energy grids – including electricity, gas and thermal grids – are being transformed into smart grids, which consist of various technological components such as smart meters, energy storage, distributed generation and smart homes. In the transition towards smart grids, the EU aims to replace 80 % of all energy meters with smart meters by 2020 and the national Dutch rollout of smart meters has started at the first of January 2015. There have been – and still are – challenges, controversies, public resistance, consternation and concerns based on values during the design process of smart meters, legislative procedure of requiring smart meters in households, and rollout of smart meters. Academic literature is written regarding the importance of values {{in the design and}} development of technologies and its influence on public acceptance, resistance and consternation. Still, there are challenges concerning the incorporation of values into smart grid components, especially smart meters, since consumer perceptions and other social interest are excluded from the design process. The rollout of smart meters and successful operation of smart grids gets threatened if smart meters and other smart grid components are socially rejected. In order stimulate the incorporation of values into smart grid components, this research has the objective “to provide input for the design for values in smart grid components by uncovering stakeholder interpretations of the values that are at stake for smart grid components”. The values that are affected by smart grid components are identified where after value descriptions and stakeholder interpretations of the values at stake are analysed to understand these values and their background. The perspective of two of the most important stakeholders – production chain organizations and end-users – is highlighted. Values are differentiated per smart grid component, stakeholder category, distinguished into supporting- or final values, and (potential) inter-value or intra-value conflicts are identified. This provides input to answer the main research question: “Which values are at stake for smart grid components according to academic literature, how are these values interpreted by Dutch stakeholders according to national newspapers and how are these values related?”. After gaining a theoretical background regarding values in ethics of technology and smart grid components, an initial list of values, including their conceptualizations, is created. This has served as input for a literature review and content analysis which are done to identify and analyse values within smart grid components literature and within The Netherlands. The initial list of values is based on values that are often mentioned in value sensitive design literature. The literature review is done on academic literature articles that pay attention to the acceptance and acceptability of smart grid components and showed which values out of the initial list are actually affected by smart grid components and whether new values emerged. In total, twenty-five literature articles are reviewed and value-laden perceptions, barriers, motivators or factors for acceptance are uncovered, causing the initial list of values to be enriched with new values. In order to uncover stakeholder interpretations of the values at stake within The Netherlands, 56 Dutch newspaper articles have been analysed by means of a qualitative content analysis. Value-laden statements and citations are distracted, recorded and coded into values while using the list of values, their conceptualizations and coding principles that have been set in the methodology chapter. A distinction has been made between positive, negative or ambiguous attitudinal directions in which stakeholders have expressed value-laden statements towards smart grid components. Values are coded in a positive attitudinal direction when they are being enhanced or the stakeholder is in favour of using a smart grid component according to how the statement is being presented or cited. On the other hand, values are coded in a negative attitudinal direction when they are being hindered or the stakeholder is against the use of a smart grid component according to how the statement is being presented or cited. This provides insights on how these values are supported or hindered from the perspective of different stakeholders. Within the literature review and content analysis results, values are differentiated per smart grid component, stakeholder category, and attitudinal direction. Barriers, motivator, factors or values-laden statements are explained in order to understand value descriptions and stakeholder interpretations. The literature review has shown that values are primarily expressed in a negative attitudinal direction within academic articles, meaning they are related to concerns based on values that are causing barriers for the design, development, and acceptance of smart grid components. This means {{that the majority of the}} values are being hindered due to the implementation of smart grid technologies, taking into account that the academic literature is merely representing the perspective of end-users. Values that have been most frequently recorded out the academic literature are economic development, privacy, autonomy, trust, environmental sustainability, and information cyber security. The content analysis does not only represent Dutch end-users but also stakeholders out of the production chain, research and consultancy, policy-maker and regulators, and the media, which can be considered as a stakeholder itself. Therefore, the values that are identified during the content analysis appeared to be more ambiguous, since both pros and cons were discussed and more stakeholder perspectives are represented within the newspaper articles. This means that for individual values, often, value-laden statements or interpretations are expressed in both positive and negative attitudinal directions, meaning values are supported or hindered depending on the stakeholder perspective that is taken. In general, production chain organizations report on values in a more positive attitudinal direction and end-users in a more negative attitudinal direction. Values that have been recorded most frequent within the content analysis are economic development, environmental sustainability, transparency, privacy, information cyber security, autonomy, and distributive justice. The academic literature includes the values security of supply, universal usability, and safety and health which are not mentioned in Dutch newspapers (yet), while the value of flexibility is mentioned in newspaper articles but not within the literature. This suggest that no events, incidents, or upfront concerns occurred or have been raised within The Netherlands concerning security of supply, universal usability, and safety and health. However, these values might become relevant in the nearby future within The Netherlands as well. Therefore, all values out of the literature review and content analysis are combined in order to identify supporting relationships or (potential) values conflicts. Using the literature review and content analysis results, a network of related values is mapped that is based on <b>overlapping</b> <b>value</b> descriptions, stakeholder interpretations and interpretations of the results. The purpose of this network is to provide an overall overview of which values are connected through which descriptions or interpretations and it has helped to analyse the nature of some relationships after zooming in on these value connections. Depending on the stakeholder perspective that is being taken, final values have various supporting values, which are depicted in separated figures. The production chain and end-users are represented best within the content analysis and the most frequently mentioned final values include: economic development, environmental sustainability, reliability, privacy, distributive justice and security of supply. Three inter-value conflicts have been identified between: transparency and information cyber security, transparency and privacy, and economic development and autarky. Potential intra-value conflicts are identified based on controversies and concerns stated in the Dutch newspapers regarding the values of distributive justice, autonomy, privacy, and information cyber security. Since supporting relationships and value conflicts depend on the stakeholder perspective that is being taken, the overall network of related values can be used in future research and practical implications to identify more supporting and conflicting relationships from the perspective of other stakeholders, who may have different thoughts on which values are considered to be important or when new stakeholder interpretation for the values at stake arise. This research contributes in shaping design for values within the energy domain as well as delivering a method to map related values by means of overlapping descriptions and interpretations and to analyse the nature of these relationships thereafter. Stakeholders, especially policy-makers and production chain organizations are recommended to use this knowledge in the design- and governance of smart grid components in order to enhance the acceptance, implementation and deployment of smart grids and their components.

We found that in the undisturbed sites, pygmy nuthatches were more frequently seen foraging on the thin branches, while white-breasted nuthatches and brown creepers were seen foraging mostly in the thick branches and lower trunk, respectively. Conversely, in the disturbed sites, the three bird species were more homogeneous with respect {{to the site of the}} tree in which they foraged. This pattern caused their niche breadth and <b>overlap</b> <b>values</b> to be similar.|$|R

The present study concerns the situations of slight overlapping between primary particles and small to moderate necking. The effects of overlapping, necking, and coating on the aggregate volume equivalent radius were presented. To show the overlapping effect, the radiative properties of aggregates consisting of N D 200 particles were evaluated with and without coating at refractive indices of m = 1. 60 + 0. 60 i for the soot core and m = 1. 46 for the coating material at four different wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared. The radiative properties of coated soot aggregates with three <b>overlapping</b> <b>values</b> of 0. 05, 0. 1, and 0. 2 were calculated. In addition, the relationship between absorption cross-section and wavelength was illustrated at <b>overlapping</b> <b>values</b> of 0. 05, 0. 1, and 0. 2 for uncoated and 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 % coated aggregates. As overlapping and necking increased, the calculated extinction, absorption, and scattering properties also increased in the visible and near-infrared regions. It {{was found that the}} volume equivalent radii of coated aggregates increased linearly with coating thickness when the necking values were 0. 40 - 0. 50...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{asymptotic}} Gibbs {{measures in the}} diluted p-spin models in the so called 1 -RSB case, when the <b>overlap</b> takes two <b>values</b> q_*, q^*∈ [0, 1]. When the external field is not present and the overlap is not equal to zero, we prove that such asymptotic Gibbs measures are described by the Mézard-Parisi ansatz conjectured in [MP]. When the external field is present, we prove that the overlap can not be equal to zero and all 1 -RSB asymptotic Gibbs measures are described by the Mézard-Parisi ansatz. Finally, we give a characterization of the exceptional case {{when there is no}} external field and the smallest <b>overlap</b> <b>value</b> is equal to zero, although it does not go as far as the Mézard-Parisi ansatz. Our approach is based on the cavity computations combined with the hierarchical exchangeability of pure states...|$|R

The model explained 91.7  % of the total variance. For the single main effects, most of the variance was explained by the time window length (effect size =  0.039), followed by the arithmetic mean of the average sizes of all connected components containing more than one node (Mean size, see Table  1; effect size =  0.004) and Mean active-first (effect size =  0.004).|$|R

40|$|Significant {{reductions}} in the water volume of shallow lakes impose a restriction on species segregation promoting more interactions in the trophic relationships. The diets of three closely related zooplanktivorous silversides belonging to the Atherinopsidae species flock of lake Chapala, Mexico, were analyzed at two sites (Chirostoma jordani, C. labarcae, and C. consocium). Diets were described in critical shallow (August 2000) and volume recovery conditions (August 2005). Diets included mainly cladocerans (Bosmina, Ceriodaphnia, and Daphnia) and copepods (Cyclops). A significant difference in diets was detected when comparing years (MRPP analysis, A = 0. 22, p < 0. 0001) and sites at different years (MRPP analysis, A = 0. 17, p = 0. 004). According to niche breadth mean values, species were classified as specialized and intermediate feeders. In shallow conditions, the small range of niche breadth (1. 72 to 3. 64) and high diet <b>overlap</b> <b>values</b> (D = 0. 64, L = 8. 62) indicated a high potential for interspecific exploitative interaction. When the lake volume recovered, {{an increase in the}} niche breadth range (1. 04 to 4. 96) and low niche <b>overlap</b> <b>values</b> (D = 0. 53, L = 2. 32) indicated a reduction of the species interaction. The Mann-Whitney U-test supported this pattern by showing a significant difference between years for niche overlap (p = 0. 006). The increased interaction during the low volume suggests alternative segregation in life-history variations and other niche dimensions such as spatial or temporal distribution...|$|R
