5|$|M-theory is {{a theory}} in physics that unifies all {{consistent}} versions of superstring theory. The existence <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> theory was first conjectured by Edward Witten at a string theory conference at the University of Southern California {{in the spring of}} 1995.

5|$|A long, straight-bladed dagger (pugio) was the gladiator's final weapon. A {{tombstone}} {{found in}} Romania shows a retiarius holding a dagger with four spikes (known as a quadrenseach spike {{at the corner}} of a square guard) instead of the usual bladed dagger. This was previously thought to be an artistic invention or perhaps a ceremonial weapon but a recently excavated femur bone from a gladiator graveyard in Ephesus has wounds consistent with the use <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> weapon.|$|E

5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{with regard}} to punitive psychiatry, the nature of psychiatry is <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> sort that using psychiatrists against opponents of authorities is always tempting for the authorities, because it is seemingly possible not {{to take into account}} an opinion by the person who received a diagnosis. Therefore, the issue will always remain relevant. While we do not have government policy of using psychiatry for repression, psychiatrists and former psychiatric nomenklatura retained the same on-the-spot reflexes.|$|E
5|$|Another way enzyme {{malfunctions}} {{can cause}} disease comes from germline mutations in genes coding for DNA repair enzymes. Defects in these enzymes cause cancer because cells are {{less able to}} repair mutations in their genomes. This causes a slow accumulation of mutations and results {{in the development of}} cancers. An example <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> hereditary cancer syndrome is xeroderma pigmentosum, which causes the development of skin cancers in response to even minimal exposure to ultraviolet light.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are often}} {{designed}} {{to mimic the}} transition state or intermediate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. This ensures that the inhibitor exploits the transition state stabilising effect of the enzyme, resulting in a better binding affinity (lower Ki) than substrate-based designs. An example <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> transition state inhibitor is the antiviral drug oseltamivir; this drug mimics the planar nature of the ring oxonium ion in {{the reaction of the}} viral enzyme neuraminidase.|$|E

5|$|In the 13th century, Newcastle upon Tyne had a {{population}} of around 4,000; and {{it was difficult for}} the four parish churches to care for the needs <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> large population.

Therefore, in 1291 land was donated by William Baron of Wark on Tweed to found an Augustinian friary on the land on which the museum now stands.|$|E
