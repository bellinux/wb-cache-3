5|$|Forensic {{profiler}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), {{a member}} of the private investigative organisation Millennium Group, chases a serial killer who targets clerics and holy men due to his frustration with his <b>own</b> <b>faith.</b>|$|E
5|$|At a church, {{the killer}} is searching through files {{when he is}} interrupted, and flees, leaving bloodied {{fingerprints}} at the scene. Black constructs {{a profile of the}} man, and deduces that his actions are attacks on faith, believing that the killer has suffered a devastating loss which has caused him to lose his <b>own</b> <b>faith.</b> As the manhunt for the killer tightens, another cleric is tortured and killed; however, Black senses that the killer has returned to where his life fell apart. He and the police are able to identify the killer as Galen Calloway (Michael Zelniker), whose wife and daughter had been killed in a house fire several years earlier. Black knows the killer's next target will be the church that held the family's funeral.|$|E
5|$|What then is {{the spirit}} of liberty? I cannot define it; I {{can only tell you}} my <b>own</b> <b>faith.</b> The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to {{understand}} the minds of other men and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; {{that there may be a}} kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest.|$|E

When she asked him to recommend books that would answer her questions, he told her she had read too many already. Besant returned to Frank to make a last unsuccessful effort to repair the marriage. She finally left for London.|$|E
25|$|ACLU of N.C. & Syidah Mateen v. State of North Carolina is a {{court case}} {{in the state of}} North Carolina within the United States of America. One of the main plaintiffs was Syidah Mateen an American-Muslim of Greensboro, North Carolina. She and the North Carolina chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union called for the state courts of North Carolina to rule that it is {{acceptable}} under the laws of the state for non-Christians to swear on religious texts of their <b>own</b> <b>faith</b> rather than the Bible of Christianity.|$|E
25|$|Private {{writings}} by both Evans and Cheevers {{indicate that}} their dedication did not preclude or {{interfere with their}} duties as a wife or mother. It was not unusual {{for women in the}} mid-seventeenth Century to show a deep devotion to religion, and mothers were often responsible for teaching and raising children according to the basic tenets of their religion. Because of this, some scholars believe it is possible that Evans and Cheevers viewed their journey as an extension as their accepted roles as devoted Christian wives. Quaker marriages were exceptional for the seventeenth century for viewing spouses as “spiritual equals,” and for allowing each marriage partner to explore and advocate for their <b>own</b> <b>faith.</b>|$|E

50|$|Theology is {{necessary}} if religion {{wants to avoid}} the pitfalls of irrationality and narrow fundamentalism. It is important to study our <b>own</b> <b>faiths</b> by using the gifts of reason and understanding, {{and the sense of}} the higher values, which nature, or rather God, has given us. Theology is not a rationalization of religion or of faith. Rather it helps faith be truly human, flourish and be fruitful within the complexities of life.|$|R
25|$|Romney opposes a rule {{issued by}} the Obama Administration's Department of Health and Human Services, in its {{implementation}} of the Affordable Care Act, which requires that nearly all health insurance plans offer free contraceptive services as part of preventive care for women. Health plans sponsored by religious employers (such as churches) that are non-profit organizations primarily employing and serving members of their <b>own</b> <b>faith</b> are exempt; but the rule does apply to institutions such as church-affiliated hospitals and schools that do not primarily employ and serve members of the faith. Romney supported a legislative measure (the Blunt amendment) {{that would have allowed}} employers and health insurance companies to deny coverage for contraceptives and other services that they object to on religious or moral grounds; the amendment failed passage in the Senate. Romney subsequently said that if elected president, he would rescind the contraception coverage requirement.|$|E
25|$|Senior {{officers}} {{attempted to}} halt the exodus of Catholics, allowing battalion commanders to appear on television (not usually permitted for the rank of lieutenant colonel in those days). Appeals were made to religious and political leaders and extra personal security measures were introduced. Brigadier Scott-Bowden's successor in 1972 was Brigadier Denis Ormerod, a Catholic whose mother's family came from the Republic of Ireland. His second-in-command (Deputy Commander UDR), Colonel Kevin Hill, was also Catholic, as was his successor Colonel Paddy Ryan. It was generally felt that these appointments were to appeal to Catholics. Ormerod admitted in his memoirs that his religion and appointment as the senior Catholic Army officer in Northern Ireland helped him considerably in his rapport with religious leaders of his <b>own</b> <b>faith</b> but that these appointments created unease with Protestants leading to meetings with concerned unionist politicians including, notably, Ian Paisley.|$|E
500|$|The first [...] "error" [...] {{was their}} denial [...] "that children, {{before the age}} of understanding, can be saved by the baptism...According to the Petrobrusians not another’s, but one’s <b>own</b> <b>faith,</b> {{together}} with baptism, saves, as the Lord says, 'He who will believe and be baptised will be saved, but he who will not believe will be condemned.'" [...] This idea ran counter to the medieval Church's teaching, particularly in the Latin West where, following the theology of Augustine, the baptism of infants and children played an essential role in their salvation from the ancestral guilt of original sin.|$|E

He ordained more than 180 apostles worldwide. In 1986, he declared that every New Apostolic Christian had personal responsibility for his <b>own</b> <b>faith's</b> existence, and he proved love, helpfulness and sympathy toward believers whose lifestyle outside the currently acceptable limits of the church (e.g. homosexuality, concubinage and divorce) and arranged their permit for the Holy Communion.|$|R

The contribution of Bangladeshi people to British life was recognised in 1998, when Pola Uddin, Baroness Uddin of Bethnal Green became the first Bangladeshi-born Briton to enter the House of Lords, and the first Muslim peer to swear her oath of allegiance {{in the name of}} her <b>own</b> <b>faith.</b> Her glory was short-lived as she was investigated and suspended from the House of Lords for an expenses scandal where she was found guilty of offences.|$|E
500|$|DeHavilland {{was raised}} in the Episcopal Church and has {{remained}} an Episcopalian throughout her life. After moving to France, she {{became one of the first}} women lectors at the American Cathedral in Paris, where she was on the regular rota for Scripture readings. As recently as 2012, she was doing readings on major feast days, including Christmas and Easter. [...] "It's a task I love", she once said. In describing her preparation for her readings, she once observed, [...] "You have to convey the deep meaning, you see, and it has to start with your <b>own</b> <b>faith.</b> But first I always pray. I pray before I start to prepare, as well. In fact, I would always say a prayer before shooting a scene, so this is not so different, in a way." [...] DeHavilland prefers to use the Revised English Bible for its poetic style. She raised her son Benjamin in the Episcopal Church and her daughter Gisèle in the Roman Catholic Church, the faith of each child's father.|$|E
500|$|Although Priestley {{was busy}} {{defending}} phlogiston theory from the [...] "new chemists", {{most of what}} he published in Birmingham was theological. In 1782 he published the fourth volume of his Institutes, An History of the Corruptions of Christianity, describing how he thought {{the teachings of the}} early Christian church had been [...] "corrupted" [...] or distorted. Schofield describes the work as [...] "derivative, disorganized, wordy, and repetitive, detailed, exhaustive, and devastatingly argued". The text addresses issues ranging from the divinity of Christ to the proper form for the Lord's Supper. Priestley followed up in 1786 with the provocatively titled book, An History of Early Opinions concerning Jesus Christ, compiled from Original Writers, proving that the Christian Church was at first Unitarian. Thomas Jefferson would later write of the profound effect that these two books had on him: [...] "I have read his Corruptions of Christianity, and Early Opinions of Jesus, over and over again; and I rest on them... as the basis of my <b>own</b> <b>faith.</b> These writings have never been answered." [...] Although a few readers such as Jefferson and other Rational Dissenters approved of the work, it was harshly reviewed because of its extreme theological positions, particularly its rejection of the Trinity.|$|E

The government beat and tortured him, {{trying to get him}} to deny his faith. He refused many times over. In 1840, he paid for his conviction when he was strangled to death.|$|R

500|$|In Public Prosecutor v. Ong Kian Cheong (2009), the District Court {{said that}} the above statement, which {{referred}} to opinions on race, applied with equal force to insensitive and denigrating opinions about religious beliefs. The case involved two accused persons who were convicted under the Sedition Act and the Undesirable Publications Act for distributing religious literature that was considered seditious and objectionable to Muslims. Section 3(1)(e) of the Sedition Act defines a seditious tendency as including a tendency to [...] "promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes {{of the population of}} Singapore". In the course of spreading their <b>own</b> <b>faith,</b> the accused persons had offended public order by distributing religious materials that were objectionable to Muslims, and the Court regarded this to be beyond the bounds of the constitutional right to propagate religion. The Court was of the view that although a person is free to choose his or her own religion and to practise it, religious fervour to spread faith must be constrained by considerations of sensitivity, tolerance and mutual respect for the faith and religious beliefs of another. Individuals cannot claim to be ignorant of the sensitivity of race and religion in Singapore's multi-racial and multi-religious society.|$|E
500|$|Johnson was a devout, {{conservative}} Anglican and {{a compassionate}} man who supported {{a number of}} poor friends under his own roof, even when unable to fully provide for himself. Johnson's Christian morality permeated his works, and he would write on moral topics with such authority and in such a trusting manner that, Walter Jackson Bate claims, [...] "no other moralist in history excels or even begins to rival him". However, Johnson's moral writings do not contain, as Donald Greene points out, [...] "a predetermined and authorized pattern of 'good behavior, even though Johnson does emphasise certain kinds of conduct. He did not let his <b>own</b> <b>faith</b> prejudice him against others, and had respect for those of other denominations who demonstrated a commitment to Christ's teachings. Although Johnson respected John Milton's poetry, he could not tolerate Milton's Puritan and Republican beliefs, feeling that they were contrary to England and Christianity. He was an opponent of slavery on moral grounds, and once proposed a toast to the [...] "next rebellion of the negroes in the West Indies". Beside his beliefs concerning humanity, Johnson is also known for his love of cats, especially his own two cats, Hodge and Lily. Boswell wrote, [...] "I never shall forget the indulgence with which he treated Hodge, his cat: for whom he himself {{used to go out}} and buy oysters, lest the servants having that trouble should take a dislike to the poor creature." [...] It is a common error to think that these oysters were expensive, since they are so in modern Britain. However, in Johnson's time they were very cheap and eaten by the poor. [...] He thought that his servant, Frank, might resent Hodge if he had to go buy the oysters for him.|$|E
