5|$|By early afternoon, the strong-point {{guarding}} the D-1 draw at Vierville was silenced by the navy. But without enough force <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> mop up the remaining defenders, the exit {{could not be}} opened. Traffic was eventually able to use this route by nightfall, and the surviving tanks of the 743rd tank battalion spent the night near Vierville.|$|E
5|$|Most boulderers use {{gymnastics}} chalk {{on their}} hands to absorb sweat. It is stored in a small chalkbag which can be tied around the waist, allowing the climber to reapply chalk during the climb. Brushes are used to remove excess chalk and other debris from boulders in between climbs; they are often attached {{to the end of}} a stick, pipe, or other straight object in order to reach higher holds. Crash pads, also referred to as bouldering mats, are foam cushions placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> protect climbers from falls.|$|E
5|$|Three PASDE canisters, located {{throughout}} the cargo bay, also photogrammetrically recorded structural response {{data of the}} Mir solar arrays during the docked phase of the mission. This data was later analyzed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> verify the use of photogrammetric techniques to characterize the structural dynamics of the array, thus demonstrating that this technology would result in cost and risk reduction for the International Space Station.|$|E

5|$|After England {{lost the}} first three Tests (which {{included}} a 46 all out in the second innings of the third Test) {{there was talk of}} another blackwash series. England secured a victory in the fourth Test however, with Stewart’s two centuries and Fraser’s eight wickets being the main contributors to the win. This {{was the first time in}} 59 years that a visiting nation had won at the Kensington Oval. The main highlight of the series was to come in the final Test at Antigua, where Brian Lara broke Sobers' Test world record score of 365 not out, set 36 years earlier, by scoring 375. Lara was congratulated by Sobers, who was present <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> see his record broken.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Ben Serotta helped {{redesign}} {{the bicycle}} {{to include a}} new seat, a simpler gear shifting mechanism, fewer and brighter lights, and a European-style center kickstand. All of Citi Bike's bicycles were to be renovated to include this new design. However, in 2016, a thousand of the newly redesigned Citi Bikes were taken out of service due to {{a part in the}} front wheel degrading faster than expected. In early 2017, as part of a pilot program with a firm named Blaze, 250 bikes received anterior laser lights that project a teal silhouette <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> warn drivers and pedestrians in their path.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes are preyed on by a {{wide range}} of animals, {{including}} various reptiles, amphibians, birds, mammals, and insects. Mammalian predators such as coatis and meerkats roll captured millipedes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> deplete and rub off their defensive secretions before consuming their prey, and certain poison dart frogs are believed to incorporate the toxic compounds of millipedes into their own defences. Several invertebrates have specialised behaviours or structures to feed on millipedes, including larval glowworm beetles, Probolomyrmex ants, chlamydephorid slugs, and predaceous dung beetles of the genera Sceliages and Deltochilum. A large subfamily of assassin bugs, the Ectrichodiinae with over 600 species, has specialized in preying upon millipedes. Parasites of millipedes include nematodes, phaeomyiid flies, and acanthocephalans.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{was added to}} the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Shortly after, the property was converted into apartments, known as Lafayette Place. Several new buildings were added <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west of the historic convent.|$|R
50|$|In 1899, {{a mental}} health facility, the Dannemora State Hospital, was built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>to</b> house prisoners who became insane while serving their sentence.

5|$|Other {{institutions}} were also formed {{with the purpose}} of providing feedback and monitoring activities <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>To</b> enhance the protection of its crown colony further from internal skirmishes and attacks, in August 1915, the legislative council passed the Reserve Force and Civil Guard Ordinance. This was the first Act passed in a British colony which imposed compulsory military service on all male subjects between the ages 15 to 55 who were not in the armed forces, volunteers, or police. Additionally, a Reserve force in the Volunteer Corps was created for fit men over the age 40. From the slew of new initiatives enforced, {{it was clear that the}} British had taken the debacle of the mutiny as a serious lesson to learn from and to prevent from happening again.|$|E
5|$|The Ilyushin Il-20 was a Soviet {{prototype}} for a heavily armored ground-attack aircraft {{to replace the}} Ilyushin Il-10. It featured a number of innovative concepts including a cockpit mounted {{on top of the}} engine, directly behind the propeller, and wing-mounted autocannon that could be adjusted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> fire level or depressed 23° to allow the aircraft to strafe ground targets while remaining in level flight. However it was slower than the Il-10, and its M-47 engine was problematic in flight tests in 1948–49. It was not placed into production. The test pilots called the aircraft the Gorbach (Hunchback).|$|E
5|$|The crew filmed several {{exterior}} {{scenes in}} the countryside near Madrid; the Cimmerian village was built in a forest near the Valsaín ski resort, south of Segovia. About onemillion pesetas ($12,084) worth of marble shavings were scattered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> simulate snow. The Wheel of Pain scene {{took place in the}} province of Ávila. Conan's encounter with the witch and Subotai was shot among the Ciudad Encantada rock formations in the province of Cuenca. Most outdoor scenes were shot in the province of Almería, which offered a semiarid climate, diverse terrain (deserts, beaches, mountains), and Roman and Moorish structures that could be adapted for many settings.|$|E

5|$|Filming moved {{once again}} in January 2011 to the Druid Hills {{quadrant}} of Atlanta, which contains {{the headquarters of the}} Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The restricted nature of the CDC campus meant that producers were only allowed to shoot exterior scenes of the area, as well as within the parking garage and reception area for the CDC's museum onsite. Principal photography then proceeded into Atlanta's central business district and Decatur, before advancing to London, Geneva, and lastly San Francisco, California, in the ensuing month. The San Francisco Film Commission charged filmmakers $300 per day for production within the city limits. In the North Beach and Potrero Hill sections of the city, production designer Howard Cummings scattered trash and discarded clothing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> depict the rapid decline of civilization. For the Civic Center set, over 2,000 extras were sought for in background roles; actors who were a part of the Screen Actors Guild were paid $139 per day, while nonunion workers received $64 per day for their work. Other filming locations were established at Golden Gate Park, Chinatown, and Candlestick Park; it cost $60,000 to rent the football stadium for six days.|$|E
5|$|In his prime, Buffon was a talented, complete, aggressive, {{and often}} instinctive goalkeeper, who was {{recognised}} for his speed, prowess, and anticipation when coming off his line in {{one on one}} situations, {{as well as his}} confidence, goalkeeping technique, reactions, and ability to get to ground quickly to collect, parry, or even challenge for the ball with his feet; when playing in teams that relied upon high defensive lines, he often functioned as a sweeper-keeper, frequently rushing out of his area to clear the ball or face opponents who had beaten the offside trap. He was also highly regarded for his handling, aerial ability, and command of the area; however, throughout his career, Buffon has occasionally been accused by pundits of being overly cautious on high balls and of not always coming out to collect crosses, and has also drawn criticism for preferring to punch the ball out to his team-mates at times rather than holding on to it. Although not as adept with the ball at his feet as the newer generation of goalkeepers that emerged in his later career, Buffon also possesses good footwork, as well as reliable distribution, which allows him to play the ball out from the back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> his defenders and start swift counter-attacks, or find his teammates further up the pitch or out on the wing with deeper kicks with his right foot; in his youth, his ball skills occasionally led him to take on opponents, whenever he was put under pressure by on-running strikers.|$|E
5|$|The ground {{originally}} had {{a capacity of}} about 12,000, but club officials decided that {{was not enough to}} give them any hope of joining the Football League. Some expansion took place in 1887, but in 1891 Newton Heath used what little financial reserves they had to purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000spectators. However, this transaction put the club at odds with the railway company, who refused to contribute any finance to the deal. The two organisations began to drift apart from then onwards, and in 1892 the club attempted to raise £2,000 in share capital to pay off the debts incurred by the expansion of the ground. The split also led the railway company to stop paying the rent due <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> the cathedral, who {{at about the same time}} decided to increase the rent. Under increasing financial pressure, especially as the cathedral authorities felt it inappropriate for the club to charge admission to the ground, an eviction notice was served on the club in June 1893. The club's management had been searching for a new stadium since the first eviction attempt in May the previous year, and they were able to move to a new ground on Bank Street, three miles away in Clayton. It proved impossible though to take the two grandstands to the new ground, and they were sold for £100.|$|E

5|$|Wes grabs {{a can of}} {{gasoline}} and pours a trail from the Jeep to the woods. They lure the Grizzly Bear to it and then set the gasoline on fire. The Jeep explodes, but the bear is unharmed. They decide to try another plan and split up. Wes climbs a tree, leaving his blood covered clothes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> fool the Bear. While the Bear is sniffing at the clothes, Wes accidentally drops a tire iron, calling the bear's attention up. The bear shakes {{him out of the}} tree but he escapes and goes to the shack where Lauren has built a trap. They lure the bear into the shack, and use a trigger to close the front door behind it, locking it in. They celebrate and start to leave but the bear breaks out of the shack and they both try to escape. Unfortunately, Wes stumbles and Lauren tries to get him back up, refusing to leave him behind despite his desperate insistence that she should run. The Bear catches up to them and presumably kills them both.|$|E
