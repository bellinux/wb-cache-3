5|$|Additional live {{specimens}} {{recovered in}} 2010 and 2011 from Oregon were all found deep inside caves. Except {{for a single}} juvenile specimen recovered from the understory debris of <b>old</b> <b>growth</b> redwood forests of northwest California, none have been found outside the caves. This specimen has different markings than T. marchingtoni and may represent a new undescribed species.|$|E
5|$|In North America, C.violaceus favours conifers, and, though rare {{over much}} of the continent, is {{relatively}} common in certain areas, including Mount Rainier National Park and Olympic National Park. It is more common in <b>old</b> <b>growth</b> forest in the Pacific Northwest, though has sprung up in regrowth areas populated with fir, pine, aspen and alder in the Great Lakes region. Fruit bodies occur singly or in small groups, often near rotting wood, and can grow in fairy rings. Closely related species that look like C.violaceus can be found in Central and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|Over the centuries, {{the tree}} grows thicker and taller as {{successive}} rings develop around its trunk and new buds grow on the branches. The tree {{becomes part of}} an <b>old</b> <b>growth</b> forest with a shaded and damp understory of broadleaf trees, shrubs, and ferns. In the canopy, a mat of dead needles and lichen accumulate on the wide upper branches. Exposed to light, air, and rain, the needles decompose and the mat becomes colonized by insects, fungus, and new plants.|$|E
50|$|The wetland {{sections}} of this Nature Preserve protect several <b>old</b> <b>growths</b> of bald cypress and water tupelo. A heron rookery has been logged here.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Damage from a European {{pine sawfly}} {{outbreak}} {{from the previous}} year. Growth {{on the edge of}} the branch came after the sawflies were killed. Second year growth is the first that gets eaten. Here, <b>older</b> <b>growth</b> survived due to pesticide use.|$|R
50|$|Tradescantia zebrina has {{attractive}} zebra-patterned leaves, {{the upper}} surface showing purple new <b>growth</b> and green <b>older</b> <b>growth</b> {{parallel to the}} central axis, {{as well as two}} broad silver-colored stripes on the outer edges, with the lower leaf surface presenting a deep uniform magenta.|$|R
5|$|The gorge {{has over}} 225species of wildflowers, plants and trees, with {{scattered}} stands of <b>old</b> <b>growth</b> forest {{on some of}} its steepest walls. The rest of the gorge is covered with thriving second growth forest that can be over one hundred years old. Since clearcutting, nearly 90percent of the forest land has burnt at least once. Typical south-facing slopes here have mountain laurel below oak and hickory trees, while north-facing slopes tend to have ferns below hemlocks and hardwoods. Large chestnuts and black cherry can also be found.|$|E
5|$|X. bracteatum {{is easy to}} grow {{both from}} seeds and from cuttings, {{although}} named cultivars only grow true from cuttings. Plants benefit from pruning of <b>old</b> <b>growth</b> in winter to allow for new growth in spring. Dead-heading, or pruning off old flower heads, promotes the production of more flowers. Fresh seeds germinate in 3 to 20days and require no special treatment. Plants grow best in acid, well-aerated soils of pH5.5 to 6.3, {{with low levels of}} phosphorus. They are sensitive to iron deficiency, which presents as yellowing (chlorosis) of the youngest leaves while the leaf veins remain green.|$|E
5|$|A {{historic}} Native American path used to {{pass through}} the water gap of Leggetts Creek on its way from the headwaters of the Lehigh River to the Great Bend on the Susquehanna River near the Pennsylvania/New York border. Some mining and quarrying operations have been done in the watershed and the Leggetts Gap Railroad was built through Leggetts Gap in the 19th century. In the late 19th, 20th, and early 21st centuries, numerous bridges were constructed across the creek. Wild trout naturally reproduce within the creek and several other species have been observed in its waters as well. Some reaches of the creek have a riparian buffer consisting of <b>old</b> <b>growth</b> forests. In other places, there are grasslands or invasive plants. A greenway/connecting trail along the creek was proposed in the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan.|$|E
50|$|Hakea orthorrhyncha has a {{spreading}} habit, {{growing to}} between 2 and 3 metres tall {{with a similar}} spread. The bright red flowers appear in clusters on <b>older</b> <b>growth</b> from early winter to early spring. The woody, beaked fruits which follow are about 40 mm long and 20 mm wide.|$|R
50|$|Its {{natural habitat}} is lowland primary rainforest, lightly logged forest and <b>old</b> {{secondary}} <b>growth.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{southern}} boundary is the Belaya River as it bends {{around the}} south end of the Ural mountains. In the east, the Park borders on the [...] "Shulgan-Tash" [...] State Sanctuary. Over 92% of the park is forested. The central region of the park is relatively difficult to access, with <b>older</b> <b>growth</b> and dead trees that support a wide variety of wildlife.|$|R
5|$|Nothomyrmecia is {{only found}} in Australia. Until its rediscovery, the genus was only {{known from the}} {{original}} specimens collected in Western Australia by Amy Crocker in December 1931. Entomologist Robert W. Taylor expressed doubt about the type locality of the ant, but said that the specimens were probably collected from {{the western end of}} the Great Australian Bight, south from Balladonia. Entomologists feared that Nothomyrmecia was extinct, as notable biologists such as E.O. Wilson made attempts to find the ant but failed to do so. In 1977, Taylor rediscovered Nothomyrmecia in Poochera, 1300km (800mi) away from the original collection site. Colonies are found in <b>old</b> <b>growth</b> mallee woodland with many Eucalyptus species such as Eucalyptus brachycalyx, Eucalyptus oleosa and Eucalyptus gracilis abundant. Only a few small colonies are known in its restricted distribution, listing it as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|The {{plant life}} around the Griffin Reservoir on Leggetts Creek {{includes}} various native trees and understory plants. From the reservoir downstream to an intake pond near Interstate 81, the creek's riparian buffer contains <b>old</b> <b>growth</b> forest, including tulip poplar trees. In addition to tulip popular, hemlock and pine also {{occur in the}} Griffin Mills reach of the creek. Near Leggetts Gap, the creek has some riparian buffering. Even in its lower reaches, the it has a stable vegetative cover in some areas. However, other areas are full of invasive plants. Major invasive plant species include Japanese knotweed, Norway Maple, and Ailanthus. Overall, the riparian buffer of the creek mainly consists of grassland and forested land.|$|E
25|$|Cape Meares National Wildlife Refuge protects one of {{the last}} {{remaining}} coastal <b>old</b> <b>growth</b> forests.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a rather}} low erect {{deciduous}} plant usually from 20-140 cm high but sometimes up to 2 metres. It spreads by basal shoots and can cover large areas. The stems have very numerous stiff bristles and many straight prickles. The young stems and prickles and the mature leaves {{tend to be very}} red with young growth a bright scarlet and <b>older</b> <b>growth</b> a deep maroon.|$|R
40|$|The seed bearing {{structure}} {{of members of}} the Pinaceae family is a cone. Pinus cones take two years to complete their life cycle. On a pine it is common to see young, immature 1 st year cones and mature (open or unopened) 2 nd year cones all on the same plant. Notice the immature cones developing near the top of this stem and the mature cone on <b>older</b> <b>growth.</b> [URL]...|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "liana" [...] {{is not a}} taxonomic grouping, {{but rather}} a {{description}} of the way the plant grows - much like [...] "tree" [...] or [...] "shrub". Lianas may be found in many different plant families. One way of distinguishing lianas from trees and shrubs is based on the stiffness, specifically, the Young's modulus of various parts of the stem. Trees and shrubs have young twigs and smaller branches which are quite flexible and <b>older</b> <b>growth</b> such as trunks and large branches which are stiffer. A liana often has stiff young <b>growths</b> and <b>older,</b> more flexible <b>growth</b> {{at the base of the}} stem.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s {{the state was}} again plunged into often bitter debate over the {{proposed}} Franklin River Dam. The anti-dam sentiment was shared by many Australians outside Tasmania and proved {{a factor in the}} election of the Hawke Labor government in 1983, which halted construction of the dam. Since the 1980s the environmental focus has shifted to <b>old</b> <b>growth</b> logging and mining in the Tarkine region, which have both proved highly divisive. The Tasmania Together process recommended an end to clear felling in high conservation <b>old</b> <b>growth</b> forests by January 2003, but was unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} areas of botanical significance: <b>Old</b> <b>growth</b> forest of Douglas-fir {{on the east}} slopes of King Range, dune system of the Mattole River, {{undisturbed}} coastal prairie, and coastal stands of reedgrass.|$|E
25|$|At {{the base}} and around the {{perimeter}} of the Chief are thick forests. Although not exactly <b>old</b> <b>growth</b> these stands of trees are representative of pacific coastal temperate rain forest common in the area. Typical tree species are Douglas fir, western red cedar, Sitka spruce, and alder.|$|E
60|$|In Gammon and Spinach Mr. Stewart Orr has {{produced}} a picture-book unique of its kind. Nothing could be more droll than the situations in which he represents the frog, the pig, the mouse, the elephant, and the other well-known characters who appear in his pages. Little folk will find in these pictures a source of endless delight, and the artistic skill which they display will have a special appeal to children of an <b>older</b> <b>growth.</b>|$|R
40|$|Measurements of bomb-produced {{radiocarbon}} and 210 Pb provide concordant {{estimates of}} {{the growth rate of}} the sclerosponge Ceratoporella nicholsoni collected from the reef slope of northern Jamaica. Radiocarbon measurements of <b>older</b> <b>growth</b> bands in the same specimen are similar to the time history of radiocarbon in coral bands from two sites in the northwestern Atlantic. Furthermore, 210 Pb and stable Pb analyses reveal that the sclerosponge incorporates this element at much higher concentrations than corals. © 1986 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
50|$|The deep pink {{flowers are}} {{produced}} on year-old or <b>older</b> <b>growth,</b> including the trunk, in late spring. Also, the flowers display a blossom with five free petals and fused sepals. This shape is {{specific to the}} Fabaceae. The leaves appear shortly after the first flowers emerge. These are cordate with a blunt apex, which occasionally has a shallow notch at the tip. The tree produces long flat pods that hang vertically. The flowers are edible and purportedly have a sweet-acid taste.|$|R
25|$|Montpelier {{includes}} the a Hands-on-Restoration-Tent open from April–October; Hands-on-Archaeology Lab and Kid-Sized Archaeology open daily; Hands-on-Cooking offered April–October; Civil War and Gilmore Farm Trail open daily; and, the Archaeology Dig open April–October. Visitors can also {{walk around the}} James Madison Landmark Forest, a 200-acre (0.81 km2) stand of <b>old</b> <b>growth</b> forest.|$|E
25|$|Small groves or {{individual}} specimens of <b>old</b> <b>growth</b> Eastern White Pines are found across {{the range of}} the species in the USA, including in Ordway Pines, Maine; Ice Glen, Massachusetts; and Adirondack Park, New York. Many sites with conspicuously large specimens represent advanced old field ecological succession. The tall stands in Mohawk Trail State Forest and William Cullen Bryant Homestead in Massachusetts are examples.|$|E
25|$|The Greens {{released}} {{a wide range}} of policies, and unlike in previous campaigns there was little attention given to forestry issues. They stated their opposition to the proposed Gunns Limited Pulp Mill in its current form. They proposed an alternative forestry policy to that of the major parties; they would reserve more of Tasmania's <b>old</b> <b>growth</b> forests, use plantation timber instead and process timber locally. One Tasmanian forestry small business group supported the policy.|$|E
50|$|Its natural {{habitats}} are primary and <b>older</b> secondary <b>growth</b> wet forests. The species uses phytotelmata for breeding, {{which must be}} present in its habitat. Females lay 2-6 eggs which male then guards.|$|R
50|$|This hermit species inhabits the {{understory}} of wet forests, woodland {{edges and}} <b>old</b> second <b>growth.</b> It {{occurs in the}} lowlands, typically up to an elevation of 800 m, although young birds may wander higher.|$|R
50|$|The grey-headed dove inhabits the {{understory}} of forests, <b>old</b> second <b>growth,</b> scrubby woodland and cacao plantations. It {{builds a}} stick nest {{in a tree}} and lays two white eggs. Incubation is about 14 days, and fledging another 15.|$|R
25|$|Lt. Denison {{was one of}} {{the junior}} Royal Engineers who worked under Lt. Colonel John By on the Rideau Canal in Upper Canada (1826–1832). Of note, Denison carried out {{experiments}} under the direction of Lt. Col. By to determine the strength, for construction purposes of the <b>old</b> <b>growth</b> Canadian timber in the vicinity of Bytown. His findings were published by the Institution of Civil Engineers in England who bestowed upon him the prestigious Telford Medal in silver.|$|E
25|$|Habitats {{within the}} {{ecoregion}} include desert-like shrubland, bluebunch grasslands, pine forest and alpine highlands {{as well as}} riverbanks and wetlands. This area is {{home to some of}} North America's largest stands of <b>old</b> <b>growth</b> forest including ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), Englemann spruce(Picea engelmannii) and other spruces, western larch (Larix occidentalis) and grand fir (Abies grandis) and other firs (Abies spp.). Other important plants are sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), juniper (Juniperus occidentalis), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), lodgepole pine (pinus contorta), shrubs, meadows, grasslands and alpine plants.|$|E
25|$|In 1881, a {{circular}} {{area with a}} radius of six miles (9.6km) from the summit was protected as a Forest Reserve. Areas encompassing the older volcanic remnants of Pouakai and Kaitake were later added to the reserve and in 1900 all this land was gazetted as Egmont National Park, the second national park in New Zealand. With intensively-farmed dairy pasture reaching {{right up to the}} mostly-circular park boundary, the change in vegetation is sharply delineated in satellite images. There are parts of the national Park where <b>old</b> <b>growth</b> forests are found.|$|E
5000|$|Sympodial: Sympodial orchids have a front (the newest growth) and a back (the <b>oldest</b> <b>growth).</b> The plant {{produces}} {{a series of}} adjacent shoots which grow to a certain size, bloom and then stop growing and are replaced. Sympodial orchids grow laterally rather than vertically, following the surface of their support. The growth continues by development of new leads, with their own leaves and roots, sprouting from or next {{to those of the}} previous year, as in Cattleya. While a new lead is developing, the rhizome may start its growth again from a so-called 'eye', an undeveloped bud, thereby branching. Sympodial orchids may have visible pseudobulbs joined by a rhizome, which creeps along the top or just beneath the soil.|$|R
5000|$|This {{sympodial}} reed-stemmed Epidendrum {{displays a}} pseudomonopodial habit: an individual stem (to 4 mm in diameter) will grow continuously {{at the tip}} for some time, before producing a bloom spike. Nevertheless, the flowers come {{from the top of}} the stem (halting its upward growth), and new stems start from buds at the base of the old stems, thus making the plant sympodial, like the rest of the subtribe Laeliinae. Less than ideal lighting will encourage the formation of numerous keikis producing a tangled mass of shoots and roots high up the plant. However, full sunlight will cause most growths to start near the base of <b>old</b> <b>growths,</b> leading to a shorter and [...] "tidier" [...] plant.|$|R
50|$|The white-eyed foliage-gleaner (Automolus leucophthalmus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Furnariidae. It is found in forests and <b>old</b> second <b>growth</b> in {{south-eastern}} Brazil, eastern Paraguay and far north-eastern Argentina. Until recently, it included the Pernambuco foliage-gleaner as a subspecies.|$|R
