40|$|Abstract — The {{development}} of a software product in an organization involves various groups of stakeholders who may prioritize the qualities of the product differently. This paper presents an empirical study of 65 individuals in different roles and in different locations, including <b>onshoring,</b> outsourcing and offshoring, prioritizing 24 software quality aspects. Hierarchical cluster analysis {{is applied to the}} prioritization data, separately for the situation today and the ideal situation, and the composition of the clusters, regarding the distribution of the inherent groupings within each of them, is analyzed. The analysis results in observing that the roles are not that important in the clustering. However, compositions of clusters regarding the onshore-offshore relationships are significantly different, showing that the offshore participants have stronger tendency to cluster together. In conclusion, stakeholders seem to form clusters of aligned understanding of priorities according to personal and cultural views rather than their roles in software development.

Recommendations are made for the producers, manufacturers, and Canadian governments to both mitigate this risk and take advantage of the BRIC's growing economies.

40|$|Recently, U. S. {{manufacturers}} are increasingly interested in bringing back their manufacturing production to onshore or near-shore suppliers. In this paper, {{we show that}} <b>onshoring</b> creates,on top of the typical cost-flexibility trade-off, a strategic value. We cast our analysis in a stylized model where a downstream firm adopts a dual-sourcing strategy for production capacity, while interacting with an upstream monopoly supplier for acquiring a critical component. We assume away demand uncertainty and document the possibility of strategic capacity shortage, i. e., the phenomenon that the downstream firm intentionally sets out offshore capacity limit upfront before contracting with the upstream supplier, even though eventually he has to bear the more expensive ex post onshore capacity expansion. Improving forecasting accuracy does not help mitigate this deadweight loss (for establishing the expensive onshore capacity). Counter-intuitively, even if the downstream firm is entitled to reduce his cost of ex post onshore capacity expansion, he may intentionally opt not to do so; accordingly, the offshore cost on a rise {{may not necessarily be}} detrimental for the downstream firm. In addition, when the onshore production becomes less expensive, under strategic capacity shortage the downstream firm tends to increase his ex ante offshore capacity and expand less onshore capacity ex post...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{software}} development environment is growing increasingly complex, {{with a greater}} diversity of stakeholders involved in product development. Moves towards global {{software development}} with <b>onshoring,</b> offshoring, insourcing and outsourcing have seen a range of stakeholders introduced to the software development process, each with their own incentives and understanding of their product. These differences between the stakeholders can be especially problematic with regard to aspects of software quality. The aspects are often not clearly and explicitly defined for a product, but still essential for its long-term sustainability. Research shows that software projects {{are more likely to}} succeed when the stakeholders share a common understanding of software quality. Objectives: This thesis has two main objectives. The first is to develop a method to determine the level of alignment between stakeholders with regard to the priority given to aspects of software quality. Given the ability to understand the levels of alignment between stakeholders, the second objective is to identify factors that support and impair this alignment. Both the method and the identified factors will help software development organisations create work environments that are better able to foster a common set of priorities with respect to software quality. Method: The primary research method employed throughout this thesis is case study research. In total, six case studies are presented, all conducted in large or multinational companies. A range of data collection techniques have been used, including questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and workshops. Results: A method to determine the level of alignment between stakeholders on the priority given to aspects of software quality is presented—the Stakeholder Alignment Assessment Method for Software Quality (SAAM-SQ). It is developed by drawing upon a systematic literature review and the experience of conducting a related case study. The method is then refined and extended through the experience gained from its repeated application in a series of case studies. These case studies are further used to identify factors that support and impair alignment in a range of different software development contexts. The contexts studied include onshore insourcing, onshore outsourcing, offshore insourcing and offshore outsourcing. Conclusion: SAAM-SQ is found to be robust, being successfully applied to case studies covering a range of different software development contexts.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate differences between the self-reported working conditions of offshore and <b>onshore</b> employees in a petroleum company in Norway. Method: We analyzed data from surveys carried out in a large petroleum company concerning working and organizational conditions in 2003, 2004 and 2005 describing the number of employees, departments, gender and age groups. We used univariate test and t-test to test differences between offshore and <b>onshore</b> departments, aggregated to department level and adjusted for age and gender. Results: Offshore and <b>onshore</b> departments differed significantly on many items in the survey, especially in the perception of the nearest manager and finding electronic information. <b>Onshore</b> workers were generally more satisfied with all organizational and working environment factors. Conclusions: Differences in management organization and type of shift work might explain the differences between <b>onshore</b> and offshore workers.

40|$|Abstract. Field {{observations}} {{suggest that}} <b>onshore</b> sandbar migration, observed when breaking-wave-driven mean flows are weak, {{may be related}} to the skewed fluid accelerations associated with the orbital velocities of nonlinear surfaze waves. Large accelerations (both increases and decreases in velocity magnitudes), previously suggested to increase sediment suspension, occur under the steep wave faces that immediately precede the maximum onshore-directed orbital velocities. Weaker accelerations occur under the gently sloping rear wave faces that precede the maximum offshore-directed velocities. The timing of strong accelerations relative to <b>onshore</b> flow is hypothesized to produce net <b>onshore</b> sediment ransport. The observed acceleration skewness, a measure of the difference in the magnitudes of accelerations under the front and rear wave faces, is maximum near the sandbar crest. The corresponding cross-shore gradients of an acceleration-related <b>onshore</b> sediment ransport would cause erosion offshore and accretion <b>onshore</b> of the bar crest, consistent with the observed <b>onshore</b> migration of the bar crest. Furthermore, the observations and numerical simulations of nonlinear shallow water waves show that the region of strongly skewed accelerations moves shoreward with the bar, suggesting that feedback between waves and evolving morphology can result in continuing <b>onshore</b> bar migration. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} asymmetries in {{arbitrage}} trading with <b>onshore</b> and offshore renminbi spot rates, {{focusing on the}} time-varying driving factors behind the deviations of the two rates from their long-run equilibrium. Fundamentally, offshore and <b>onshore</b> renminbi rates represent the same economic quantity and hence should be driven by the same pricing mechanism. However, the two exchange rates deviate remarkably from each other, creating arbitrage opportunities over many days. For the empirical analysis, I build a three-regime threshold vector error correction model with offshore and <b>onshore</b> spot rates and further regime-dependent explanatory variables. The model is estimated in different periods in order to consider the impact of appreciation and depreciation expectations on possible arbitrage trading. The estimation results suggest that directional expectations, global risk sentiment, and local as well as global liquidity conditions dominate the adjustment process {{in the absence of}} arbitrage trading when the offshore rate is stronger than its <b>onshore</b> counterpart. However, the error correction mechanism of the offshore (<b>onshore)</b> rate toward its equilibrium with the <b>onshore</b> (offshore) rate is driven by the arbitrage trading due to a relatively weaker (stronger) offshore (<b>onshore)</b> rate in the upper regime in times of appreciation (depreciation) expectations...|$|R
