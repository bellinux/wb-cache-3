Following the procedure, Ezri — now known as Ezri Dax — spent time at the Symbiosis Institute on Trill to learn to adapt to her new state. Because of her new state, Ezri's romantic relationship with her former boyfriend ended, as she later explained to her family that he reminded her <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>past</b> host's son.|$|E

5|$|A further {{elaboration}} on {{this story}} is possibly found in a chronicle of Wincenty Kadłubek written some three centuries later. The chronicler, inadvertently or intentionally mixing different historic eras, talks <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>past</b> Polish war with the army of Alexander the Great. The countless enemy soldiers thrust their way into Poland, and the king himself, having previously subjugated the Pannonians, entered through Moravia {{as if it were}} a back door. He victoriously unfolded the wings of his forces and conquered the Kraków area lands and Silesia, in the process leveling Kraków's ancient city walls. The evidence of a dozen or more gords attacked and destroyed in southern Lesser Poland at the end of 9th century lends some archeological credence to this fanciful version of events.|$|E

Memento is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed during the film: a series in black-and-white that is shown chronologically, {{and a series of}} color sequences shown in reverse order (simulating for the audience the mental state of the protagonist). The two sequences meet {{at the end of the}} film, producing one complete and cohesive narrative.|$|E

5|$|The dust is {{constantly}} being {{removed from the}} main ring {{by a combination of}} Poynting–Robertson drag and electromagnetic forces from the Jovian magnetosphere. Volatile materials, for example ices, evaporate quickly. The lifetime of dust particles in the ring is from 100 to 1000years, so the dust must be continuously replenished in the collisions between large bodies with sizes from 1cm to 0.5km and between the same large bodies and high velocity particles coming from outside the Jovian system. This parent body population is confined to the narrow—about 1000km—and bright outer part of the main ring, and includes Metis and Adrastea. The largest parent bodies must be less than 0.5km in size. The upper limit on their size was obtained by New Horizons spacecraft. The previous upper limit, obtained from HST and Cassini observations, was near 4km. The dust produced in collisions retains approximately the same orbital elements as the parent bodies and slowly spirals in the direction of Jupiter forming the faint (in back-scattered light) innermost part of the main ring and halo ring. The age of the main ring is currently unknown, but it may be the last remnant <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>past</b> population of small bodies near Jupiter.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally {{ascribed}} to Moses himself, modern scholarship sees {{the book as}} initially {{a product of the}} Babylonian exile (6th century BCE), based on earlier written and oral traditions, with final revisions in the Persian post-exilic period (5th century BCE).

The other dog is known as Bodu or tchen Bodu (tchen being dog in Dgèrnésiais). His appearance, usually in the Clos du Valle, foretells death of the viewer or someone close to him. There are also numerous other unnamed apparitions, usually associated with placenames derived from bête (beast).|$|E

25|$|The philosopher C. T. K. Chari of Madras Christian College in Chennai, a {{specialist}} in parapsychology, argued that Stevenson was naive and that the case studies were undermined by his lack of local knowledge. Chari wrote {{that many of the}} cases had come from societies, such as that of India, where people believed in reincarnation, and that the stories were simply cultural artifacts; he argued that, for children in many Asian countries, the recall <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>past</b> life is the equivalent of an imaginary playmate. The philosopher Keith Augustine made a similar argument. Stevenson responded that it was precisely those societies that listened to children's claims about past lives, which in Europe or North America would normally be dismissed without investigation. To address the cultural concern, he wrote European Cases of the Reincarnation Type (2003), which presented forty cases he had examined in Europe.|$|E
