5|$|In 1467, {{as part of}} his brother's {{plan for}} a closer {{relationship}} with the French, John and Isabelle accompanied Warwick in escorting the French King's envoys to Canterbury. However, by this time, it was being rumoured that Warwick was moving towards supporting the House of Lancaster, as a result <b>of</b> <b>dissatisfaction</b> over the king's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville and his pursuit of an anti-French foreign policy. In 1469, Warwick organised Robin of Redesdale's rebellion against Edward IV in Yorkshire and in July that year the king's brother George, Duke of Clarence married Warwick's daughter Isabelle whilst anchored off Calais; this was in direct defiance of the king's own wishes. It seems that Montagu, however, reacted strongly against his brother's machinations, and, unlike him, was satisfied with his current position.|$|E
5|$|Oldenburg {{participated in}} the {{ceremonial}} transfer of the island of Helgoland from British to German control {{in the summer of}} 1890. She was present during the fleet maneuvers in September, where the entire eight-ship armored squadron simulated a Russian fleet blockading Kiel. She remained with the I Division in 1891; the year's maneuvers simulated a two-front war against Russia and either France or Denmark. In 1892, however, Württemberg replaced Oldenburg in the I Division, and the latter went into reserve. The ship remained out of service for the next five years. She returned to active duty in 1897 to join an international naval demonstration off the island of Crete, which had been annexed by Greece. The ship remained in the demonstration until March 1898, when Germany and Austria-Hungary withdrew their naval contingents in a show <b>of</b> <b>dissatisfaction</b> over the compromise solution, which left Crete under Ottoman control, but with a Greek prince.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background We {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the hypothesis that mental health impairment in underweight women, where this occurs, is due to an association between low body weight and elevated levels <b>of</b> body <b>dissatisfaction</b> and/or eating-disordered behaviour. Methods Subgroups of underweight and normal-weight women recruited from a large, general population sample were compared on measures <b>of</b> body <b>dissatisfaction,</b> eating-disordered behaviour and mental health. Results Underweight women had significantly greater impairment in mental health than normal-weight women, even after controlling for between-group differences in demographic characteristics and physical health. However, {{there was no evidence}} that higher levels <b>of</b> body <b>dissatisfaction</b> or eating-disordered behaviour accounted for this difference. Rather, underweight women had significantly lower levels <b>of</b> body <b>dissatisfaction</b> and eating-disordered behaviour than normal-weight women. Conclusions The findings suggest that mental health impairment in underweight women, where this occurs, is unlikely to be due to higher levels <b>of</b> body <b>dissatisfaction</b> or eating-disordered behaviour. Rather, lower levels <b>of</b> body <b>dissatisfaction</b> and eating-disordered behaviour among underweight women may counterbalance, to some extent, impairment due to other factors. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine self-esteem, {{exposure}} to the media 2 ̆ 7 s portrayal of the ideal male body, and athletic standing of college-aged men in relation to body dissatisfaction. College men (N= 100) were surveyed on these variables. It was hypothesized that males with greater body dissatisfaction would have lower levels of self-esteem. Further, it was expected that males who were more frequently exposed to the body ideal would have higher levels <b>of</b> body <b>dissatisfaction,</b> and that males who do not participate in a college sport would have higher levels <b>of</b> body <b>dissatisfaction</b> than those who do. Results show a significant relationship between body dissatisfaction and self-esteem, such that high levels <b>of</b> body <b>dissatisfaction</b> are associated with low levels of self-esteem. A positive correlation was found between exposure to the media ideal and levels <b>of</b> body <b>dissatisfaction,</b> such that increased exposure was associated with high levels <b>of</b> body <b>dissatisfaction.</b> No significant correlation was found between athletic status and body <b>dissatisfaction.</b> Results <b>of</b> the current study add to previous literature, as well as focus on the college-aged male population...|$|R
5|$|President Antanas Smetona's {{unconditional}} {{acceptance of a}} second ultimatum {{in the space of}} a little over one year became a major source <b>of</b> <b>dissatisfaction</b> with his authoritarian rule. The German ultimatum triggered a political crisis: the passive cabinet of Vladas Mironas was replaced by a cabinet headed by General Jonas Černius. For the first time since the 1926 coup d'état, the government included members of the opposition: Leonas Bistras, of the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, was named Minister of Education and Jurgis Krikščiūnas, of the Lithuanian Popular Peasants' Union, was named Minister of Agriculture. Because other parties were banned, Bistras and Krikščiūnas were officially billed as independent private citizens. Four generals were now members of the cabinet as well. However, even the looming international crisis did not induce Lithuanian politicians to unite, and they continued to engage in petty political disputes.|$|E
5|$|Students in Malawi have {{expressed}} high levels <b>of</b> <b>dissatisfaction</b> regarding the HIV/AIDS-related education and support they receive at school. According {{to a survey}} of students in Malawi, most secondary students {{do not believe that}} the HIV/AIDS curricula at their schools provide them with an adequate understanding of the disease. Although the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations have conducted many campaigns to improve awareness about HIV/AIDS in schools, there is still a significant shortage of age-appropriate audio and visual educational materials relating to HIV/AIDS available to instructors, particularly in rural areas. In addition, most teachers cannot identify the students in their classes who have been personally affected by the epidemic, either through friends or relatives, which suggests that school-based support for HIV/AIDS is minimal. However, despite this lack of support, surveys indicate that children who have been affected by the epidemic do not usually experience HIV/AIDS-based discrimination at school.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explain the {{definition}} of adequate compensation from the viewpoints of affected landowners, property valuers and land administrators using Kotaka’s Model with special application in Kedah, Malaysia. The fact is that land is a factor of production and must be made available for the provision of infrastructure. In acquiring land for real estate development, compensation must be paid to the affected landowners. An adequate compensation in land acquisition is referred to the open market value of the land taken plus its consequences including severance, injurious affection and disturbances. Design/methodology/approach – Questionnaires are distributed to the affected 40 landowners,ten property valuers and six land administrators of randomly selected land acquisition projects for public infrastructure land development in the case study areas. Data gathered are analyzed using qualitative descriptive analysis to identify elements <b>of</b> <b>dissatisfactions</b> <b>of</b> landowners upon compensation offered to them. Findings – The findings show that there are elements <b>of</b> <b>dissatisfactions</b> to the affected landowners by way of the value of land taken, severances, injurious affections, disturbances, delivery of notices and technique <b>of</b> valuation. These <b>dissatisfactions</b> reflect the amount of adequate compensation to the affected landowners and cross-examined with property valuers and land administrators. Originality/value – The outcome of the paper will assist landowners, public, and private valuers, land administrators and other stakeholders to understand the elements <b>of</b> <b>dissatisfactions</b> in estimating adequate compensation in land acquisition for infrastructure provision. Otherwise, the affected landowners may refuse to be apart from their lands, hence, restrict the flow of land supply for real estate development. This indicates that Kotaka’s Model offers an explanatory power to understand the elements of adequate compensation in land acquisition for infrastructure provision and real estate development...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the urgent problem related to the {{development}} of the region, namely, the creation of tools for the assessment of the level <b>of</b> social <b>dissatisfaction</b> in the region. The assessment of the level <b>of</b> social <b>dissatisfaction</b> is one <b>of</b> the most important tasks of state organizations in political and social spheres. The article considers the concept of "social dissatisfaction" and associated terms, it substantiates the author's position on the content of this notion. The authors have investigated the existing national and international approaches to the assessing of social tensions of the population. The system of socio-economic development indicators doesn’t contain indicators allowing to assess the level <b>of</b> social <b>dissatisfaction</b> without the results of public polls. We propose two models in the article. In the first model, the assessment is basedon the single factor (the index <b>of</b> social <b>dissatisfaction</b> based on income differentiation). The second complex model takes into account a number of factors (the index <b>of</b> social <b>dissatisfaction</b> based on complex assessment). For the calculation of the proposed indicators, the authors use the statistical data of the Federal State Statistics Service. The methodological research tools include the mathematical methods of statistical data processing. We have evaluated the methodological tools on the example of the Republic of Ingushetia. The assessment has showed the dynamics of a decline in the level <b>of</b> social-economic <b>dissatisfaction</b> in the region (1995 – 2011). The models <b>of</b> social <b>dissatisfaction</b> constitute a tool for rapid and up-to-date assessment of socio-economic system sustainability, and of the willingness of the population to participate in protests. The application of the results of this study is the support of decision-making regions and state structures in working out plans of the socio-economic development of the regions...|$|R

25|$|To justify such {{a radical}} move towards the {{depiction}} {{of the world in}} unrecognizable terms, Antliff and Leighten argue that the emergence of Cubism transpired during an era <b>of</b> <b>dissatisfaction</b> with positivism, materialism and determinism. The 19th century theories upon which such philosophies were based, came under attack by intellectuals such as the philosophers Henri Bergson and Friedrich Nietzsche, William James and the mathematician Henri Poincaré. New philosophical and scientific ideas emerged based on non-Euclidean geometry, Riemannian geometry and the relativity of knowledge, contradicting notions of absolute truth. These ideas were disseminated and debated in widely available popularized publications, and read by writers and artists associated with the advent of Cubism. Popularized too were new scientific discoveries such as Röntgen's X-rays, Hertzian electromagnetic radiation and radio waves propagating through space, revealing realities not only hidden from human observation, but beyond the sphere of sensory perception. Perception was no longer associated solely with the static, passive receipt of visible signals, but became dynamically shaped by learning, memory and expectation.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the First World War there was a sense <b>of</b> <b>dissatisfaction</b> in how honours were distributed. The effect was the passage of the Nickel Resolution. The resolution created a policy of Canadians not being appointed to peerages or titular honours, and the government of Canada only making recommendation for a handful of non-titular honours. In 1931, the Statute of Westminster reaffirmed the equality of the self-governing dominions of the British Empire, however there was no mechanism to establish honours specific to the dominions. In 1935, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Long Service Medal was established as the first award specifically for service in Canada. The Canadian government managed the creation of this medal by passing the recommendation for creating the honour on to the Dominions Office, who had experience with drafting Royal Warrants. In 1934, King George V signed the Royal Warrant creating the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Long Service Medal. Prime Minister R.B. Bennett countersigned the Royal Warrant 15 December 1934 signifying that the King was acting on the advice of his Canadian Ministry.|$|E
40|$|Body dissatisfaction (i. e., a {{negative}} attitude towards one’s own physical appearance) is assumed to originate from a perceived discrepancy between the actual physical appearance (i. e., actual body image) and the desired ideal state of the body (i. e., ideal body image). We assessed implicit beliefs about these two aspects of the body image independently using two Relational Responding Tasks (RRT) {{in a sample of}} participants who were either low or high in explicitly reported body dissatisfaction. As hypothesized, differences in body dissatisfaction exerted a differential influence on the two RRT scores. The implicit belief that one is thin was less pronounced in participants who were strongly dissatisfied with their body relative to participants who were more satisfied with their body. The implicit desire to be thin (i. e., thin ideal body image), in contrast, tended to be more pronounced in participants who exhibited a high degree <b>of</b> body <b>dissatisfaction</b> as compared to participants who exhibited a low degree <b>of</b> body <b>dissatisfaction.</b> Hierarchical regression analyses also revealed that the RRT scores were predictive <b>of</b> self-reported body <b>dissatisfaction,</b> even over and above the predictive validity of some (but not all) explicit predictors <b>of</b> body <b>dissatisfaction</b> that were included in the present study. More generally, these findings contribute to the empirical validation of the RRT as a measure of implicit beliefs in the context <b>of</b> body <b>dissatisfaction...</b>|$|R

Therefore the paper seeks to redefine the adequate amount of compensation from landowners, valuers and administrators viewpoints using Kotaka’s Model with special application in Malaysia. In doing so, data is gathered from landowners, administrators and valuers from selected cases of land acquisitions.
