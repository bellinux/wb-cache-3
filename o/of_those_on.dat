Healthcare premium cost increases in the employer market continued to moderate. For example, healthcare premiums for those covered by employers rose by 69% from 2000-2005, but only 27% from 2010 to 2015, with only a 3% increase from 2015 to 2016.|$|E
5|$|Norwich re-appointed Gunn {{as manager}} for the 2009–10 season. Crook, as first team coach, and former Canary Ian Butterworth, as {{assistant}} manager, completed the management team. Over the summer, Gunn signed 12 players, most <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> free transfers, including Australian Michael Theoklitos, a goalkeeper from Melbourne Victory. He then steered the club through a programme of pre-season friendly matches, in which Norwich was unbeaten.|$|E
5|$|Attempts by law {{enforcement}} to investigate conditions at Gold Base have been blocked by legal difficulties and the unwillingness <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> the base {{to talk to the}} police. According to Lawrence Wright, who wrote an account of the Hole in his 2013 book , the Riverside County sheriff's office has never received a complaint from someone at the base about their treatment there, despite the many accounts of mistreatment. Wright attributes this to the fear that many Scientologists have of bringing shame upon Scientology and of being forced to break off contact with their families and friends.|$|E

The others are at Stobcross (Finnieston Crane), Scotstoun (Barclay Curle Crane) and Greenock (James Watt Dock Crane). Fewer than sixty giant cantilever cranes were built worldwide, six of them on the Clyde, and as of May 2011, it is believed only eleven remained, four <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> the Clyde.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the N, N1 and K class locomotives, the Midland Railway {{influence}} of Clayton showed in the placement of locomotive fittings on the production batch, as the water top-feed into the boiler was located inside a dome, whilst the cab area was a modified version <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> the 0-6-0s of Henry Fowler and the K class rebuilds. The rebuilds had Midland Railway-style double spectacle plates (the small windows on the front face of the cab) {{left over from the}} K class cabs, whereas the production versions had one each side of the boiler. Such modifications were becoming typical of the Southern Railway’s attempt to produce a fleet of standardised locomotives. However, all members of the U class were to vary from GWR practice, as the superheating surface area was increased, and all were equipped with outside Walschaerts valve gear.|$|E
5|$|In many respects, the YF-22s were {{different}} from production F-22s. Contrary to the F-117 Nighthawk, which was initially difficult to control because of small vertical stabilizers, Lockheed over-specified the fin area on its YF-22. Therefore, the company reduced the size <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> F-22s by 20–30 percent. Lockheed recontoured {{the shape of the}} wing and stabilator trailing edges to improve aerodynamics, strength, and stealth characteristics; the wing and stabilitor sweep was reduced by 6° from 48°. Finally, to improve pilot visibility, the canopy was moved forward 7inches (178mm), and the engine intakes were moved rearward 14inches (356mm).|$|E

5|$|King won the Child's Bowling Cup, {{the premier}} award for bowling in American cricket, {{for the first}} time in 1896, and joined the Philadelphian cricket team's tour of England in 1897. The tour was very ambitious, and was {{arranged}} mainly for educational purposes: few <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> the American side expected to win many matches. Previous tours had tended to involve amateur English sides with a low level of competition. In 1897, the tour started on June 7 at Oxford, ending in late July at The Oval almost 2 months later. The schedule included fifteen matches against all of the top county cricket teams, the Oxford and Cambridge University teams, the Marylebone Cricket Club, and two other sides, though only a few of the counties thought it worthwhile to put their best elevens onto the field.|$|E
5|$|The {{first signs}} of panic were seen {{when a group of}} {{passengers}} attempted to rush port-side lifeboat No.14 as it was being lowered with 40people aboard. Fifth Officer Lowe, {{who was in charge of}} the boat, fired three warning shots in the air to control the crowd without causing injuries. No.16 was lowered five minutes later. Among those aboard was stewardess Violet Jessop, who would repeat the experience four years later when she survived the sinking of one of Titanics sister ships, , in the First World War. Collapsible boat C was launched at 01:40 from a now largely deserted area of the deck, as most <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> deck had moved to the stern of the ship. It was aboard this boat that White Star chairman and managing director J. Bruce Ismay, Titanics most controversial survivor, made his escape from the ship, an act later condemned as cowardice.|$|E

5|$|Sunday, August 24, 1924, was a {{warm summer}} day in Brooklyn, and Helen Palsgraf, a 40-year-old janitor and housekeeper, was taking her two daughters, Elizabeth and Lillian, aged 15 and 12, to Rockaway Beach. Having paid the {{necessary}} fare, {{they were on the}} platform at the East New York station of the LIRR on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, when a train, not theirs, pulled in. As it began to move again, two men raced for the train, and one made it without incident, as the doors had not closed. The other, a man carrying a package, leapt aboard, {{with the help of a}} platform guard pushing him from behind as a member of the train's crew pulled him into the car. But in the process, the man lost the package, which dropped and exploded, for it apparently contained fireworks. Either the force of the explosion or the panicking <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> the platform caused a tall, coin-operated scale to topple onto Helen Palsgraf. No one was hurt enough to spend the night in the hospital, though several people, Palsgraf among them, were listed as injured.|$|E
5|$|The bill of the {{specimen}} is black with a yellowish tip, and the cere is also black, with feathers {{on the upper}} side, almost to the nostrils. The lores are naked, and {{the upper part of}} the head is sooty black. The rest of the head is mostly brownish-black. The feathers of the nape and the neck are slightly bifurcated and have a dark green gloss, the latter with coppery reflections. The feathers of the neck are elongated (sometimes referred to as hackles), and some <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> the sides and lower part have paler spots near the tips. Most of the feathers on the upperparts and wings are dark brown or brownish-black with a dark green gloss. Almost all of these feathers have a triangular, yellowish-buff spot at their tips. The spots are almost whitish on some of the scapular feathers, vague and dark on the primary feathers. The underside of the wings is black with browner flight feathers, which have a pale spot or band at the tips. The breast is brownish-black with a faint green sheen. The tail is blackish with a dark green sheen, brownish-black on the underside, with a narrow, cinnamon-coloured band at the end. This differs from the rust-coloured tail-tip apparently shown in the drawing owned by Lever, and Latham's own illustration. The legs are small and slender, have long toes, large claws, and a comparatively short tarsus, whereas the Nicobar pigeon has shorter claws and a longer tarsus.|$|E

5|$|The first {{aviation}} {{incident to}} result in more than 50 fatalities did not involve an airplane. On 21 December 1923, the Dixmude, a rigid airship of the French Navy, was reportedly struck by lightning and crashed into the Mediterranean Sea, off Sicily, Italy. All 52 crew and passengers were killed. Nearly 10 years later, the , also a rigid airship, encountered severe weather and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, off Barnegat Light, New Jersey, killing 73 <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> board. It was another 5 years before a fixed-wing aircraft incident claimed more than 50 fatalities. On 24 July 1938, A Curtiss Hawk II crashed into spectator stands in the Santa Ana air show disaster. 52 spectators were killed {{on the ground in}} addition to the pilot of the airplane. One month later on 24 August 1938, the Japan mid-air collision in Tokyo claimed 53 lives on the ground in addition to the 5 crew members aboard both planes.|$|E
5|$|Through late September, Caltech seismometers {{recorded}} 188 aftershocks {{higher than}} magnitude 4.0. Six <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> {{the day of}} the mainshock were M5 and above, but some of these (like the 12:05 M6.3 shock) were only felt, and didn't cause any damage. The July 21 M5.1 shock at 15:13 GMT and the July 23 shock at 00:38 both damaged buildings in Arvin, and the latter event also caused slight damage in Fresno and near Bakersfield. Three additional shocks on July 23 were particularly destructive. Walls and other portions of buildings that had been previously damaged took a second hit from the 07:53 M5.2 event, and a house that saw only minor damage during the mainshock was nearly destroyed by it. Gas and water lines were also severed, and transformers were loosened or dislodged. The 13:17 M5.8 shock compounded problems at Tehachapi and Arvin with damage to previously-affected buildings that was described as serious, but the 18:13 shock on July 23 only had a slight affect at Arvin.|$|E
