25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>the</b> movie {{does best}} is {{transport}} {{you back in}} time and into nature. In the early scenes as Joel leaves his aunt's home to travel across the South by rickety bus and horse and carriage, you feel the strangeness, wonder and anxiety of a child abandoning everything that's familiar to go to a place so remote he has to ask directions along the way. The landscape over which he travels is so rich and fertile that you can almost smell the earth and sky. Later on, when Joel tussles with Idabell (Aubrey Dollar), a tomboyish neighbor who becomes his best friend (a character inspired by the author Harper Lee), the movie has a special force and clarity in its evocation of the physical immediacy of being a child playing outdoors.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{announced that a}} committee be convened under Lord Desborough that would look at all aspects of police forces in England, Wales, and Scotland. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>the</b> committee highlighted was the inconsistency in police pay. At the time, there was no uniform pay structure for the police. Local Watch Committees were the sole arbiters of police pay. The pay of agricultural workers and unskilled labourers had outstripped that of the police. The Desborough Committee recorded that the pay for the average constable serving in a provincial force with five years service who was married with two children would earn 2 pounds 15 shillings , including all their allowances such as rent and a child allowance. The Desborough Committee cited examples that a street sweeper in Newcastle-on-Tyne was on the same rate of pay as a constable in the provincial force. Ten other examples cited by the committee also showed police were paid less than menial labour occupations, six of which paid higher than the Metropolitan Police. Lord Desborough was therefore quite sympathetic {{to the plight of}} the ordinary policeman regarding pay, and consequently recommended comparatively generous increases.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, Dale {{was cast}} in the {{continuing}} role of Jim Robinson in the Australian soap opera Neighbours, earning him acclaim across the world, including the United Kingdom. He appeared on the show from the first episode and stayed for eight years before his character was killed off in 1993. He found working on Neighbours [...] "exciting" [...] and it enabled him to provide for his sons, but he noted: [...] "You were a totally replaceable commodity; [...] didn't put any value {{on any of the}} people appearing in the show." [...] He expanded: [...] "I didn't like it there, they were not nice people. When we decided that we hated each other, the company and me, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>the</b> company did was to market everything they could out of us and pay us nothing." [...] Dale and the company (Grundy Television) parted on [...] "bad terms".|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 22nd, inclosing a {{draft of}} two hundred dollars, was duly received. I have paid it on the judgment, and {{herewith}} you have the receipt. I {{do not wish to}} say anything as to who shall be the Republican candidate for the Legislature in your district, further than that I have full confidence in Dr. Hull. Have you ever {{got in the way of}} consulting with McKinley in political matters? He is true as steel, and his judgment is very good. The last I heard from him, he rather thought Weldon, of De Witt, was our best timber for representative, all things considered. But you there must settle it among yourselves. It may well puzzle older heads than yours to understand how, as the Dred Scott decision holds, Congress can authorize a Territorial Legislature to do everything else, and cannot authorize them to prohibit slavery. That is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>the</b> court can decide, but can never give an intelligible reason for.|$|E

60|$|June 11th.--I paid another {{visit to}} the Uffizi gallery this morning, {{and found that the}} Venus is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>the</b> charm of which does not {{diminish}} on better acquaintance. The world has not grown weary of her in all these ages; and mortal man may look on her with new delight from infancy to old age, and keep the memory of her, I should imagine, as one of the treasures of spiritual existence hereafter. Surely, it makes me more ready to believe in the high destinies of the human race, to think that this beautiful form is but nature's plan for all womankind, and that the nearer the actual woman approaches it, the more natural she is. I do not, and cannot think of her as a senseless image, but as a being that lives to gladden the world, incapable of decay and death; as young and fair to-day as she was three thousand years ago, and still to be young and fair as long as a beautiful thought shall require physical embodiment. I wonder how any sculptor has had the impertinence to aim at any other presentation of female beauty. I mean no disrespect to Gibson or Powers, or a hundred other men who people the world with nudities, all of which are abortions as compared with her; but I think the world would be all the richer if their Venuses, their Greek Slaves, their Eves, were burnt into quicklime, leaving us only this statue as our image of the beautiful. I observed to-day that the eyes of the statue are slightly hollowed out, in a peculiar way, so as to give them a look of depth and intelligence. She is a miracle. The sculptor must have wrought religiously, and have felt that something far beyond his own skill was working through his hands. I mean to leave off speaking of the Venus hereafter, in utter despair of saying what I wish; especially as the contemplation of the statue will refine and elevate my taste, and make it continually more difficult to express my sense of its excellence, as the perception of it grows upon one. If at any time I become less sensible of it, it will be my deterioration, not any defect in the statue.|$|E

50|$|A {{border town}} {{is a town}} or city close to the {{boundary}} between two countries, states, or regions. Usually the term implies that the nearness to the border is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>the</b> place is most famous for. With close proximities to a different country, exotic culture and traditions can have certain influence to the place. Border towns can have highly cosmopolitan communities, a feature they share with port cities, as traveling and trading often go through the town. They can also be flashpoints for international conflicts, especially when the two countries have territorial disputes.|$|E
