[...] In 1964 the group appeared on the T.A.M.I. Show on same bill as the Rolling Stones, James Brown. [...] In the film of the show, their drummer, Victor [...] "Moulty" [...] Moulton, is seen holding one of his drumsticks with a prosthetic clamp while playing, {{as the result of}} a previous accident in which he lost his left hand. [...] In 1966, Moulton recorded [...] "Moulty", a spoken monologue set to music, in which he recounted the travails of his disfigurement, released under the Barbarians' name, but backed by future members of the Band.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the firm}} did not release the poll results before the election. The {{day after the}} election, when Giron had been {{recalled}} by 12 points, they released the poll and company director Tom Jensen explained why they had not initially done so, citing numerous unusual results. These included the district supporting her recall by such a wide margin, despite having been carried by 20 points by Democratic President Barack Obama in the 2012 election; and voters saying they supported universal background checks by 68% to 27% and being split 47% to 47% on limiting high-capacity ammunition magazines to 15 bullets. Jensen opined that [...] "if voters were really making their recall votes based on those two laws, that doesn't point to recalling Giron by a 12 point margin" [...] and that the NRA had done a [...] "good job of turning the election more broadly into 'do you support gun rights <b>or</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> opposed to them.'" [...] Their decision not to release the poll before the election caused significant controversy, with some statisticians and journalists criticising them and others supporting them.|$|E

[...] She appeared on chat shows ITV Breakfast and Live with Gabby in 2011, and returned to television in March 2013 as a guest on The Alan Titchmarsh Show. She took a job in Brighton, and has a blog that she started during the production of My Transsexual Summer. In the spring of 2013, she started HRT. 2013 was also the inaugural year of Trans* Pride Brighton, the first transgender pride festival in the UK, and she and Fox Fisher served on the organisation committee. In 2015 Sarah and Fox published a picture book, Are You a Boy <b>or</b> <b>are</b> <b>You</b> a Girl?, which Sarah wrote and Fox illustrated. [...] "Before I started transitioning, I never wrote, I never... did anything creative," [...] said Sarah in a 2013 interview. [...] "For some reason... living in a female role {{has allowed me to}} be more creative." ...|$|E

500|$|In May and June 1939, Elizabeth and {{her husband}} toured Canada {{from coast to coast}} and back, and visited the United States, {{spending}} time with President Roosevelt at the White House and his Hudson Valley estate. U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt said that Elizabeth was [...] "perfect as a Queen, gracious, informed, saying the right thing & kind but a little self-consciously regal". The tour was designed to bolster trans-Atlantic support in the event of war, and to affirm Canada's status as an independent kingdom sharing with Britain the same person as monarch. According to an often-told story, during one of the earliest of the royal couple's repeated encounters with the crowds, a Boer War veteran asked Elizabeth, [...] "Are you Scots <b>or</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> English?" [...] She replied, [...] "I am a Canadian!" [...] Their reception by the Canadian and U.S. public was extremely enthusiastic, and largely dissipated any residual feeling that George and Elizabeth were a lesser substitute for Edward. Elizabeth told Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, [...] "that tour made us", and she returned to Canada frequently both on official tours and privately.|$|E
500|$|... "Kill the Lights" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. A review by The Sun described [...] "Kill the Lights" [...] as [...] "a brilliant disco banger", while Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that [...] "Kill the Lights" [...] {{was a great}} [...] "sleek and sexy" [...] song, {{that should have been}} on Blackout instead of Circus. Anna Dimond of TV Guide commented that [...] "Kill the Lights" [...] shows that [...] "even a pop star needs alone time. Especially with her special someone," [...] and Jam!'s Darryl Sterdan considered it as a [...] "futuristic and vaguely ominous dance-floor filler". John Murphy of musicOMH noted the song is [...] "seemingly an open letter to Spears' paparazzi photographer ex-boyfriend with lines like 'Mr Photographer, I think I'm ready for my close-up' and 'is that money in your pocket, <b>or</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> just pleased to see me'", while Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star compared it to [...] "Womanizer" [...] (2008), saying both have [...] "the same swaggering beat hits". Poppy Cosyns of The Sun considered [...] "Kill the Lights" [...] as [...] "a full-on bolshy tirade, attacking sleazy parasitic paps with a vocal performance reminiscent of leotard-era Madonna". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian gave the song a negative review, saying it [...] "attempts to raise the kind of ire found on 'Blackout', but falls flat." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{recurring}} {{source of}} lyrical subject matter in Let the Blind Lead is Cox's best friend, Deerhunter guitarist Lockett Pundt, whom {{the album is}} dedicated to. [...] "Winter Vacation" [...] concerns {{the first time the}} two met. Seeing him at a bus stop while vacationing in Savannah, Georgia, Cox was [...] "attracted to him, but not in some kind of like, just physical way." [...] Seeing [...] "his melancholy, his sitting alone, staring at the ground", he [...] "fell in love" [...] with him. Cox and his family later drove to a beach; [...] "Winter Vacation" [...] relates to Cox’s memory of the beach, being [...] "infected with that new love" [...] found after meeting Pundt. The words of [...] "Scraping Past" [...] are about [...] "moving on…And wondering if somebody is going to come with you or…stay behind." [...] This uncertainty is characterized by several lines Cox considers [...] "pop song clichés", referencing [...] "rain that comes and goes." [...] In the song, Cox asks Pundt, [...] "Are you going to come with me, <b>or</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> staying here?" [...] In [...] "Ativan" [...] Cox examines his addiction to the drug of the same name, as well as his relationship with Pundt. [...] "It talks a lot about how things have changed between me and Lockett's relationship and how he's met a girl and…our friendship is never gonna change, but it's difficult sometimes." [...] Cox asserts that he would [...] "rather just take whatever drugs it takes to go to sleep and sleep through it…I'm not prepared to face it yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{answer to}} this lies in a player's {{position}} on the board. Is this {{the beginning of the}} game, and is the player willing to chance a loss for a hoped-for big gain?

2500|$|In 1939, Universal Pictures {{approached}} West {{to star in}} a film opposite W. C. Fields. The {{studio was}} eager to duplicate the success of Destry Rides Again starring Marlene Dietrich and James Stewart with a comic vehicle starring West and Fields. Having left Paramount 18 months earlier {{and looking for a}} new film, West accepted the role of Flower Belle Lee in the film My Little Chickadee (1940). Despite the stars' intense mutual dislike, and Fields's very real drinking problems, and fights over the screenplay, My Little Chickadee was a box-office success, outgrossing Fields's previous film, You Can't Cheat an Honest Man (1939), and the later The Bank Dick (1940). Despite this, religious leaders condemned West as a negative role model, taking offense at lines such as [...] "Between two evils, I like to pick the one I haven't tried before," [...] and [...] "Is that a gun in your pocket, <b>or</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> just glad to see me?" ...|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "But when we were coming with the idea of it, I was meeting with hair and make up and Lou Eyrich, the costumer, and we at first came up with this idea that she was the black version of Miss Havisham. But I didn't like that. I thought let's do something unexpected. So our inspirations were very bizarre. We took sort of like 1940s, hard-boiled noir women and mixed it with a sort of Comme des Garçons meets Japanese thing. I was very proud of that look and I thought Franny was very yummy.

2500|$|However, in {{that same}} year, 2002, there began a {{controversy}} in Iceland about the Baugur Group, owned by the entrepreneurs Jóhannes Jónsson and his son, Jón Ásgeir Jóhannesson. A giant on the Icelandic scene, Baugur controlled {{the majority of the}} retail business in Iceland: in parliament, the then leader of the Social Democratic party, Össur Skarphéðinsson, called for closer supervision of possible monopoly pricing, specifically mentioning Baugur. Davíð concurred. In summer 2002, the Icelandic police raided the headquarters of Baugur, after a disgruntled former employee of their American operations had produced what he claimed was evidence of financial irregularities. The two main owners of Baugur did not take kindly to this, and accused Davíð of orchestrating a campaign against them. They bought a newspaper, Fréttablaðið, which is distributed free of charge to every household in Iceland. The paper opposed Davíð in the bitterly-fought 2003 parliamentary election when there was talk of corruption, bribery and abuse of the police. In a speech on 9 February 2003, the main spokesperson of the Social Democratic Alliance, Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir, suggested that Davíð might be responsible for the tax investigation of businessman Jón Ólafsson, then owner of a private television station, and also for the police raid on Baugur.
