40|$|Populations of the {{introduced}} book trout, Salvelinus fontinalis, {{have recently}} become more widespread and abundant in western North American streams, possible {{at the expense}} of native Colorado River cutthroat trout, Oncorhynchus clarki pleuriticus. We examined the intensity and potential mechanism of competition between these species. Feeding experiments in laboratory stream channels showed that cutthroat trout feeding efficiency decreases in the presence <b>of</b> a brook <b>trout.</b> Decreased feeding efficiency appeared to be due to interference, as cutthroat trout were inactive in the presence <b>of</b> the brook <b>trout.</b> Evidence for interference competition in the feeding experiments was also given by the fact that brook trout feeding efficiency was lower than the feeding efficiency <b>of</b> cutthroat <b>trout.</b> The decreased feeding efficiency <b>of</b> cutthroat <b>trout</b> in the presence <b>of</b> brook <b>trout</b> was due to decreased attack rates by cutthroat trout, and was not due to attacks and consumption of the food items by the brook trout. A field enclosure experiment, in which riffle-pool sections of a stream were isolated by fencing, was performed to determine if the presence <b>of</b> brook <b>trout</b> had a negative effect on the growth, fat content, and diet <b>of</b> cutthroat <b>trout.</b> Cutthroat trout fat levels were significantly lower in the presence <b>of</b> brook <b>trout.</b> The growth <b>of</b> cutthroat <b>trout</b> was not significantly different in the presence and absence <b>of</b> brook <b>trout,</b> but there was a trend fro lower growth <b>of</b> cutthroat <b>trout</b> in the presence <b>of</b> brook <b>trout.</b> Diet choices and total biomass of prey consumed by cutthroat trout in the field experiment and in a survey of three streams were not affected by the presence <b>of</b> brook <b>trout.</b> The observed decreased feeding efficiency <b>of</b> cutthroat <b>trout</b> in the presence <b>of</b> brook <b>trout</b> may be the mechanism responsible for the significant;y decreased fat levels during the relatively short, summer growing season and may result in reduced population sizes due to high overwinter mortality and delayed sexual maturity...|$|R

5|$|Mount Adams is the second-most isolated, {{in terms}} of access, {{stratovolcano}} in Washington; Glacier Peak is the most isolated. Only two major highways pass close to it. Highway 12 passes about 25 {{miles to the north}} of Adams through the Cascades. Highway 141 comes within 13 miles of Adams as it follows the White Salmon River valley up from the Columbia River to the small town <b>of</b> <b>Trout</b> Lake. From either highway, travelers have to use Forest Service roads to get closer to the mountain. The main access roads, FR 23, FR 82, FR 80, and FR 21, are paved for part of their length. Most all other roads are gravel or dirt, with varying degrees of maintenance. Access to the Mount Adams Recreation Area is by way of FR 82, which becomes BIA 285 at the Yakama reservation boundary. BIA 285 is known to be extremely rough and often suitable only for trucks or high-clearance vehicles. Two small towns, Glenwood and Trout Lake, are located in valleys less than 15 miles from the summit, Glenwood on the southeast quarter and Trout Lake on the southwest quarter.|$|E
5|$|The Snake River fine-spotted {{cutthroat}} trout (or Snake River {{cutthroat trout}}) {{is the only}} native trout species in Grand Teton National Park. It is also the only subspecies of cutthroat trout that is exclusively native to large streams and rivers. Various researchers {{have not been able}} to identify any genetic differences between the Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout and the Yellowstone cutthroat trout, though in terms of appearances, the Snake River subspecies has much smaller spots which cover a greater portion of the body, and the two subspecies inhabit different ecological niches. The Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout was identified by some researchers as a separate subspecies by the mid-1990s, and is managed as a distinct subspecies by the state of Wyoming, but is not yet recognized as such by the neighboring states of Idaho and Montana. Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout is found only in the Snake River and tributaries below the Jackson Lake dam to the Palisades Reservoir in Idaho. Other non-native species <b>of</b> <b>trout</b> such as the rainbow trout and lake trout were introduced by the Wyoming Fish and Game Department or migrated out of Yellowstone. Today five trout species inhabit park waters. Native species of fish include the mountain whitefish, longnose dace, mountain sucker and non-native species include the Utah chub and Arctic grayling.|$|E

5|$|The {{streams and}} lakes around Adams offer {{a number of}} fish for the angler to seek out. The two most common species, eastern brook trout and rainbow trout (Columbia River redband trout), are in nearly every lake and stream. Brown trout and {{cutthroat}} trout appear {{in most of the}} lakes in the High Lakes Area and three lakes are home to tiger trout. All the lakes in the High Lakes Area are periodically replanted with varying species <b>of</b> <b>trout.</b> Bull trout {{can be found in the}} upper reaches of the Klickitat and Lewis Rivers. Westslope cutthroat trout can be found the Klickitat and cutthroat trout are found in the Lewis River and upper reaches of the Cispus River. Whitefish can be found in the Klickitat, Lewis, and Cispus Rivers. Because of barriers to fish passage (dams on the Lewis and Cowlitz Rivers, falls on the White Salmon River), the only river where anadromous fishes can reach the streams around Adams is the Klickitat River. Chinook salmon, coho salmon, and steelhead, in several different runs, make for the upper reaches of the Klickitat, including those around Adams, every year.|$|E
