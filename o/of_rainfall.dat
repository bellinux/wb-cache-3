30|$|The {{influences}} {{about the}} land-property lawsuits in relations to rainfalls from the regression analysis: it shows no significant influences. An {{interesting thing is}} that, when we use temperature and evaporation as the instrument variables <b>of</b> <b>rainfalls,</b> we find that there exists a negative significant influence on quantities of land-property lawsuit. Which means that increase amount <b>of</b> <b>rainfalls</b> will show significant decreasing the quantity of land lawsuit cases. Therefore, the amount <b>of</b> <b>rainfalls</b> has direct or indirect influences {{on the value of}} lands. The empirical results from this article extend the ones from the past literature. Miguel et al. (2004), Ciccone (2011), Brückner and Ciccone (2011) studied the causal relationships of civic wars, economic shock, and democracy when the volatility <b>of</b> <b>rainfalls</b> becomes more and more unstable. In this article, we focus on an issue between rainfalls and property rights, and the evidences shows that a huge shock in values of lands closely depends on rainfalls in Taiwan from 1920 to 1940.|$|R

5|$|In 1975 American mycologist Martina S.

A threshold <b>of</b> <b>rainfall</b> is required to elicit a spore discharge response and the duration of peak spore discharge correlates with the amount <b>of</b> <b>rainfall,</b> rather than its duration. Furthermore, Gilliam noted that spore prints were more readily obtained if the stem ends were placed in water, suggesting that water must enter through the fruit body for discharge to occur.|$|E

30|$|The {{economic}} outputs {{in agricultural}} societies highly depend on rainfalls. When the amount <b>of</b> <b>rainfalls</b> is not changing rapidly, the economic outputs will stably grow and then promote {{an increase in}} population.

Therefore, if fluctuations <b>of</b> <b>rainfalls</b> maintain to be more stable, the number of land lawsuits may be decreased.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{the paper}} a simple method of CSO (combined sewer overflow) spill {{frequency}} determination, which uses historical rainfall records and linear reservoir model, was described. The method {{is based on}} evaluation of characteristic parameters, such {{as the time of}} duration and the intensity <b>of</b> the <b>rainfall</b> which initiates CSO, further referred to as the initiating rainfall. An initiating rainfall is determined individually for particular CSO {{as a function of the}} catchment parameters and the parameters of CSO spillway. The initiating rainfall intensity is calculated on basis the flow with depth equal to weir crest level. The duration time <b>of</b> initiating <b>rainfall</b> is a function of catchment parameters and travel time in sewers. Classification <b>of</b> historical <b>rainfalls</b> according to parameters <b>of</b> initiating <b>rainfall</b> makes possible to determine the number <b>of</b> <b>rainfalls</b> generating CSO spills in a specified period, hence the frequency of spills can be easily computed. In the paper a case study results were presented. Results obtained from described method are almost the same as results of SWMM 5 package simulation of the rainfall-runoff process in urban catchment...|$|R
40|$|Aim of this {{research}} is to study stochastic characteristics <b>of</b> daily <b>rainfall</b> series. The study was undertaken using 25 years (1977 - 2001) data of Purajaya region. The series <b>of</b> the daily <b>rainfall</b> data assumed was trend free. The periodic components <b>of</b> daily <b>rainfall</b> series were represented by using 253 harmonic expressions and stochastic components <b>of</b> daily <b>rainfall</b> series were presented using second order autoregressive parameters. Validation <b>of</b> generated daily <b>rainfall</b> series was done by comparing between generated with measured daily rainfall series. For periodic modeling, mean of the correlation coefficient between generated and measured daily rainfall series with the number of the data N is equal to 512 days for 25 years was found to be 0, 9576. For periodic and stochastic modeling, mean of the correlation coefficient was found to be 0. 9999. Therefore, developed periodic and stochastic model could be used for future prediction <b>of</b> daily <b>rainfall</b> time series.
