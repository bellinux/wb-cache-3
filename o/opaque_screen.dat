50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, a few {{libraries}} {{began to}} implement microfilm as a means of preserving records. A 1904 fire in the National Library of Turin that destroyed more than half the manuscripts stored there raised concerns of preservation of unique and rare materials. In 1905, these issues were addressed at the Congres International pour la reproduction des Manuscripts, des Monnaies et des Sceaux. It was decided that a photographic library would be established in all libraries. In 1956, Unesco set up a special microfilm unit with the intention of visiting various countries to micro film books, documents, and other cultural material in danger of being destroyed and those which are irreplaceable. This special unit also trained technicians to handle microfilm. Microfilm readers are stored in special rooms known as “Reading rooms”, with two prevalent types of readers. The first is for use of transparent microphotographs and the other used for micro opaque cards. In modern translucent microfilm readers, light is projected into a film producing an enlarged image of the film on a translucent screen, and in opaque readers the same process occurs except the image in on an <b>opaque</b> <b>screen.</b> In using a translucent screen, the image can be seen in daylight, provided no direct sunlight in on the screen. The <b>opaque</b> <b>screen</b> however, is cheaper to produce but requires a darker room.|$|E

The speed of the emulsion was then expressed in 'degrees' Warnerke (sometimes seen as Warn. or °W.) corresponding with the last number visible on the exposed plate after development and fixation. Each number represented an increase of 1/3 in speed, typical plate speeds were between 10° and 25° Warnerke at the time.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} this sensor {{was based on}} an {{aperture}} array that had been developed in 1900 by Johannes Franz Hartmann as a means of tracing individual rays of light through the optical system of a large telescope, thereby testing the quality of the image. In the late 1960s, Roland Shack and Ben Platt modified the Hartmann screen by replacing the apertures in an <b>opaque</b> <b>screen</b> by an array of lenslets. The terminology as proposed by Shack and Platt was Hartmann screen. The fundamental principle seems to be documented even before Huygens by the Jesuit philosopher, Christopher Scheiner, in Austria.|$|E

However, in other domains, such as sensory development, much information has been gained from controlled rearing studies with animals. Here, we used a similar experimental strategy to investigate intuitive reasoning about occluded objects. Newborn domestic chicks (Gallus gallus) were reared singly with a small object that became their social partner. They were then accustomed to rejoin such an imprinting object when it was made to move and disappear behind either one of two identical <b>opaque</b> <b>screens.</b> After disappearance of the imprinting object, chicks were faced with two screens of different slants, or of different height or different width, {{which may or may}} not have been compatible with the presence of the imprinting object hidden beneath/behind them. Chicks consistently chose the screen of slant/height/width compatible with the presence of the object beneath/behind it. Preventing chicks from touching and pecking at the imprinting object before testing did not affect the results, suggesting that intuitive reasoning about physical objects is largely independent of specific experience of interaction with objects and of objects’ occluding events...|$|R

50|$|In {{the same}} paper, they {{proposed}} the Collaborative Model as an alternative. They believed this model was {{more able to}} explain the aforementioned features of conversation. They had conducted an experiment to support this theory and also to further determine how the acceptance process worked. The experiment consisted of two participants seated at tables separated by an <b>opaque</b> <b>screen.</b> On the tables {{in front of each}} participant were a series of Tangram figures arranged in different orders. One participant, called the director, was tasked with getting the other participant, called the matcher, to accurately match his configuration of figures through conversation alone. This process was to be repeated 5 additional times by the same individuals, playing the same roles. The collaborative model they proposed allowed them to make several predictions about what would happen. They predicted that it would require many more words to establish reference the first time, as the participants would need to use non-standard noun phrases which would make it difficult to determine which figures were being talked about. However, they hypothesized that later references to the same figures would take fewer words and a shorter amount of time, because by this point definite reference would have been mutually established, and also because the subjects would be able to rely on established standard noun phrases. The results of the study confirmed many of their beliefs, and outlined some of the processes of collaborative reference, including establishing the types of noun phrases used in presentation, and their frequency.|$|E

40|$|Non-invasive optical imaging techniques, such as optical {{coherence}} tomography 1, 2, 3, {{are essential}} diagnostic tools in many disciplines, from the life sciences to nanotechnology. However, present methods {{are not able to}} image through opaque layers that scatter all the incident light 4, 5. Even a very thin layer of a scattering material can appear opaque and hide any objects behind it 6. Although great progress has been made recently with methods such as ghost imaging 7, 8 and wavefront shaping 9, 10, 11, present procedures are still invasive because they require either a detector 12 or a nonlinear material 13 to be placed behind the scattering layer. Here we report an optical method that allows non-invasive imaging of a fluorescent object that is completely hidden behind an opaque scattering layer. We illuminate the object with laser light that has passed through the scattering layer. We scan the angle of incidence of the laser beam and detect the total fluorescence of the object from the front. From the detected signal, we obtain the image of the hidden object using an iterative algorithm 14, 15. As a proof of concept, we retrieve a detailed image of a fluorescent object, comparable in size (50 [*]micrometres) to a typical human cell, hidden 6 [*]millimetres behind an opaque optical diffuser, and an image of a complex biological sample enclosed between two <b>opaque</b> <b>screens.</b> This approach to non-invasive imaging through strongly scattering media can be generalized to other contrast mechanisms and geometrie...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{propagation}} of a pulse across a vacuum gap separating opposite flat parallel faces of two transparent dielectrics {{by means of an}} explicitly causal and retarded propagator constructed directly from the free-space wave equation. Nevertheless, our approach yields apparently superluminal propagation for the case of frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR), that is, a transmitted wave packet appears {{on the far side of}} the gap at the same time that the corresponding incident packet crosses the front one. Thus, in this example superluminality is just an illusion, being consistent with both casuality and classical electrodynamics. We study the origin of the apparent superluminality in this case, which is inherent to light pulse propagation in free space and does not depend on the particulars of light-matter interaction, and find that it is due to propagation from the lateral wings of the incident pulse to the central part of the transmitted pulse. Thus, notwithstanding their similarities, FTIR is not equivalent to 1 D tunneling. We propose experiments to test our explanation of superluminality using <b>opaque</b> <b>screens</b> to block part of the wavefront, although we demonstrate that {{the propagation of}} smooth finite pulses constrained to be made up completely of evanescent Fourier components is indistinguishable from truly superluminal propagation, i. e., it may be completely accounted for using an explicitely superluminal and acausal propagator as well as the causal subluminal one.

40|$|In our {{previous}} research we reported a leftward-asymmetry in domestic chicks required {{to identify a}} target element, {{on the basis of}} its ordinal position, in a series of identical elements. Here we re-coded behavioral data collected in a previous study from chicks tested in a task involving a different kind of numerical ability, to study lateralization in dealing with an arithmetic task. Chicks were reared with a set of identical objects representing artificial social companions. On day 4, chicks underwent a free-choice test in which two sets, each composed of a different number of identical objects (5 vs. 10 or 6 vs. 9, Exp. 1), were hidden behind two <b>opaque</b> <b>screens</b> placed in front of the chick, one on the left and one on the right side. Objects disappeared, one by one, behind either screen, so that, for example, one screen occluded 5 objects and the other 10 objects. The left-right position of the larger set was counterbalanced between trials. Results show that chicks, in the attempt to rejoin the set with the higher number of social companions, performed better when this was located to the right. However, when the number of elements in the two sets was identical (2 vs. 2, in Exp. 2) and they differed only in the coloration of the objects, this bias was not observed, suggesting a predisposition to map the numerical magnitude from left to right. Future studies should be devoted to the direct investigation of this phenomenon, possibly employing an identical number of mono-chromatic imprinting stimuli in both conditions involving a numerical discrimination and conditions not involving any numerosity difference...|$|R

The clouds act as nearby <b>opaque</b> <b>screens</b> and delimit a well-defined survey volume which is in principle free {{of the problem of}} distinguishing nearby, intrinsically faint dwarf stars from more distant red giants. This study is based upon deep photographic and CCD photometry at optical (V, R, I) bandpasses toward the most highly obscured portions of the Taurus and Ophiuchus molecular clouds. The total volume delimited by the clouds is approximately 200 cu pc. Within this region our survey is complete for all stars brighter than M(sub V) = 16 - 17 mag; at R and I, the survey is complete down to the lowest mass stars capable of sustaining core hydrogen burning. We estimate the faint end of the field star luminosity function for the composite Taurus and Ophiuchus foreground sample and find that it resembles the local luminosity function down to M(sub V) approx. 16. At still fainter magnitudes we find more stars than do photometric parallex studies of the polar regions. This difference widens dramatically if even the simplest correction for incompleteness is applied to our data. We therefore tentatively conclude that the luminosity function rises beyond M(sub V) approx. 16; even if we discard our attempts to correct for incompleteness in the faintest magnitude bins, the luminosity function at least remains flat for the lowest mass stars. Our provisional finding that the luminosity function rises beyond its well-known peak at M(sub V) approx. 12 - 13, implies that the initial mass function (IMF) probably rises beyond the turnover point associated with this peak.
