5|$|The {{incident}} proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed {{heavily on}} his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial. Two weeks after the arrest, he told his friend, journalist Sharon Lawrence, that his fear <b>of</b> <b>needles</b> discouraged him from using heroin and that associating with junkies had convinced him {{it was not a}} drug he wanted to use. Both of Hendrix's Experience bandmates, Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, later stated that they had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto and they believed that drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag. Although Hendrix {{was one of the biggest}} stars in North America at the time, and the world's highest-paid performer, only a couple of Toronto newspapers carried the story. His public relations manager, Michael Goldstein, later revealed that he bribed a member of the Associated Press with a case of liquor in an effort to prevent the story from going out on the news wire.|$|E

The letter was found by Pamela and given to Jill, who uses it to ambush Hoffman as William reaches {{the end of his}} path with one second left, finding himself between the cages. It is revealed that Pamela is his sister, while Tara and Brent are Harold's family. Tara is informed by a videotape of Kramer that she can either kill William or free him using the switch; when she is unable to make a decision, Brent angrily shifts the switch and a bed <b>of</b> <b>needles</b> swings down and injects William's body with the acid, killing him. Jill restrains Hoffman and locks a new reverse bear trap to his head. She shows him the sixth envelope, which contains his photo, and leaves him with 45 seconds but no key. Hoffman escapes by breaking his hand and jamming the trap as it activates, and he pulls his head free, ripping open his cheek.|$|E

It deals with the proper way <b>of</b> <b>needle</b> insertion, minimise the deflection <b>of</b> <b>needle</b> inside the tissue and gives an idea of reduction in deformation of tissue. The test procedures and experimental setup provide an understanding on the mechanics <b>of</b> <b>needle</b> placement and the design improvement of insertion instruments. The experimental analysis optimize the results of operative parameters <b>of</b> <b>needle</b> when it insert in the tissue like needle translation motion during the insertion, needle rotational motion during insertion, angle <b>of</b> <b>needle</b> insertion and force acting on the needle when it inserted in the tissue. The optimize results provide a brief knowledge for the surgeons about the needle behaviour during the insertion in soft tissue so surgeons are pre imagined the situations by which they would going through during the operation. The model enhances the quality of insertion by presenting the optimize model for parameters <b>of</b> <b>needle</b> insertion. In most of the insertion operations accuracy and precision is important parameters which must be kept in mind by the surgeons when they performed the insertion <b>of</b> <b>needle</b> inside the tissue so this is study is relevant for them to get the accuracy and precision in work.

40|$|Introduction. In {{traditional}} Chinese acupuncture, needle sensation (deqi) is {{purported to}} contribute to a therapeutic outcome. While researchers have attempted to define deqi qualitatively, few have examined the effects <b>of</b> <b>needling</b> parameters on its intensity. Methods. 24 healthy subjects completed eight interventions scheduled at least one week apart, which involved manual acupuncture to LI 4 or a designated nonacupoint (NAP) on the hand, with real or simulated manipulation each three minutes and <b>needle</b> retentions <b>of</b> one or 21 minutes. Intensities <b>of</b> <b>needling</b> sensation and pain were reported every three minutes and sensation qualities were reported post-intervention. Results. Immediately after needle insertion, similar levels <b>of</b> mean <b>needle</b> sensation and <b>of</b> pain were reported independent of intervention. At subsequent measurement times, only two interventions (one at LI 4 and one at NAP) maintained statistically significantly elevated needle sensation and pain scores and reported higher numbers <b>of</b> <b>needle</b> sensation descriptors. For both, the needle was retained for 21 minutes and manipulated every three minutes. Neither intervention differed significantly in terms of levels <b>of</b> pain, and <b>needle</b> sensation or numbers and qualities <b>of</b> <b>needle</b> sensation described. Conclusion. In this group of healthy subjects, the initial needling for all eight interventions elicited similar levels <b>of</b> <b>needle</b> sensation and pain. These levels were only maintained if there was ongoing <b>of</b> <b>needle</b> manipulation and retention <b>of</b> the <b>needle.</b> By contrast, the strength <b>of</b> <b>needle</b> sensation or pain experienced was independent of insertion site...|$|R

25|$|The {{profile of}} glossopterid trees is largely {{speculative}} as complete trees {{have not been}} preserved. However, based on analogies with modern high-latitude plants Glossopteris trees probably tapered upwards like a Christmas tree and were relatively widely spaced {{to take advantage of}} the low-angle sunlight at high latitudes.

25|$|Late 20th century domestic/studio models {{typically}} use up to 200 latch-hook needles to {{hold the}} stitches in fine, standard, mid-gauge or bulky gauge needle. A carriage or cam box is passed across the bed <b>of</b> <b>needles</b> causing the needle movements required to produce each next stitch. By means of various selection methods, e.g. punch cards, particular needles can be caused to travel by alternate pathways through the cam box. Thus needles will knit or not, and the unknitted yarn portions will lie under (slip stitch) or over the needle or {{be held in the}} needle hook (tuck stitch). Needles can be placed in holding position to allow short row shaping. In the most modern machines, punchcards have been replaced by computer control.|$|E

25|$|Fraser {{recorded}} {{the development of}} a single white spruce tree from 1926 to 1961. Apical growth of the stem was slow from 1926 through 1936 when the tree was competing with herbs and shrubs and probably shaded by larger trees. Lateral branches began to show reduced growth and some were no longer in evidence on the 36-year-old tree. Apical growth totalling about 340 m, 370 m, 420 m, 450 m, 500 m, 600 m, and 600 m was made by the tree in the years 1955 through 1961, respectively. The total number <b>of</b> <b>needles</b> of all ages present on the 36-year-old tree in 1961 was 5.25 million weighing 14.25kg. In 1961, needles as old as 13 years remained on the tree.The ash weight <b>of</b> <b>needles</b> increased progressively with age from about 4% in first-year needles in 1961 to about 8% in needles 10 years old. In discussing the data obtained from the one 11 m tall white spruce, Fraser et al. (1964) speculated that if the photosynthate used in making apical growth in 1961 was manufactured the previous year, then the 4 million needles that were produced up to 1960 manufactured food for about 600,000mm of apical growth or 730 g dry weight, over 12 million mm3 of wood for the 1961 annual ring, plus 1 million new needles, in addition to new tissue in branches, bark, and roots in 1960. Added to this would be the photosynthate to produce energy to sustain respiration over this period, an mount estimated to be about 10% of the total annual photosynthate production of a young healthy tree. On this basis, one needle produced food for about 0.19mg dry weight of apical growth, 3mm3 wood, one-quarter of a new needle, plus an unknown amount of branch wood, bark and roots.|$|E
