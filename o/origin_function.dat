50|$|Origins in {{budding yeast}} {{are defined by}} the {{autonomously}} replicating sequence (ARS), a short stretch of DNA (100-200 bp) that can initiate replication when transferred to any sequence of DNA. The ARS contains several specific sequence elements. One {{of these is the}} A element (ACS), an 11 bp consensus sequence rich in adenines and thymines that is essential for initiation. Single base-pair mutations in the ACS can abolish initiation activity. The ORC, a component of the initiation complex, binds the ACS in vivo throughout the cell cycle, and in vitro in an ATP dependent manner. When a few of these sequences are deleted, DNA is still copied from other intact origins, but when many are deleted, chromosome replication slows down dramatically. Still, presence of an ACS sequence is not sufficient to identify an origin of replication. Only about 30% of ACS sequences present in the genome are the sites of initiation activity. Origins in fission yeast contain long stretches of DNA rich in thymines and adenines that are important for <b>origin</b> <b>function,</b> but do not exhibit strong sequence similarity.|$|E

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{evolutionary}} <b>origins</b> and <b>functions</b> of {{the capacity for}} anxiety, and relevant clinical and research issues. Normal anxiety is an emotion that helps organisms defend against {{a wide variety of}} threats. There is a general capacity for normal defensive arousal, and subtypes of normal anxiety protect against particular kinds of threats. These normal subtypes correspond somewhat to mild forms of various anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders arise from dysregulation of normal defensive responses, raising the possibility of a hypophobic disorder (too little anxiety). If a drug were discovered that abolished all defensive anxiety, it could do harm as well as good. Factors that have shaped anxiety-regulation mechanisms can explain prepotent and prepared tendencies to associate anxiety more quickly with certain cues than with others. These tendencies lead to excess fear of largely archaic dangers, like snakes, and too little fear of new threats, like cars. An understanding of the evolutionary <b>origins,</b> <b>functions,</b> and mechanisms of anxiety suggests new questions about anxiety disorders...|$|R
40|$|We have {{localized}} an {{origin of}} DNA replication at the L terminus of the pseudorabies virus genome. This origin differs in location {{as well as}} in general structure from the origins of replication of other herpesviruses that have been identified. The 600 leftmost nucleotides of the genome that were found to include <b>origin</b> <b>function</b> have been analyzed. This sequence is composed of an 82 -bp palindrome whose center of symmetry is separated by 352 unique bp (UL 2). Within the UL 2, a sequence that fits the consensus sequence of the NF 1 binding site, as well as one that has partial homology to the binding site of UL 9 of herpes simplex virus, is present. Using truncated fragments of DNA, sequences essential for minimal <b>origin</b> <b>function</b> were delimited to within a fragment that includes the terminal 104 bp of the left end of the genome. Within these 104 bp, two elements essential to <b>origin</b> <b>function</b> have been identified. One of these elements is present within the terminal 64 bp of the L component (Within one of the palindromic arms). The other is present within the 22 bp of the UL 2 adjacent to this palindromic arm.

40|$|Abstract Background Eukaryotic {{replication}} origins exhibit different initiation efficiencies and activation times within S-phase. Although local chromatin {{structure and}} function influences origin activity, the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood. A key to understanding the exact features of chromatin that impinge on replication <b>origin</b> <b>function</b> is to define the precise locations of the DNA sequences that control <b>origin</b> <b>function.</b> In S. cerevisiae, Autonomously Replicating Sequences (ARSs) contain a consensus sequence (ACS) that binds the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) and is essential for <b>origin</b> <b>function.</b> However, an ACS is not sufficient for <b>origin</b> <b>function</b> {{and the majority of}} ACS matches do not function as ORC binding sites, complicating the specific identification of these sites. Results To identify essential origin sequences genome-wide, we utilized a tiled oligonucleotide array (NimbleGen) to map the ORC and Mcm 2 p binding sites at high resolution. These binding sites define a set of potential Autonomously Replicating Sequences (ARSs), which we term nimARSs. The nimARS set comprises 529 ORC and/or Mcm 2 p binding sites, which includes 95 % of known ARSs, and experimental verification demonstrates that 94 % are functional. The resolution of the analysis facilitated identification of potential ACSs (nimACSs) within 370 nimARSs. Cross-validation shows that the nimACS predictions include 58 % of known ACSs, and experimental verification indicates that 82 % are essential for ARS activity. Conclusion These findings provide the most comprehensive, accurate, and detailed mapping of ORC binding sites to date, adding to the emerging picture of the chromatin organization of the budding yeast genome. </p...|$|E

40|$|Although it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that eukaryotic cellular origins of DNA replication may harbor stimulatory elements that bind transcription factors, how these factors stimulate <b>origin</b> <b>function</b> is unknown. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the transcription factor Abf 1 p stimulates <b>origin</b> <b>function</b> of ARS 121 and ARS 1. In the results presented here, an analysis of Abf 1 p function {{has been carried out}} utilizing LexA(BD) -Abf 1 p fusion proteins and an ARS 121 derivative harboring LexA DNA-binding sites. A minimal region which stimulates <b>origin</b> <b>function</b> mapped to 50 amino acids within the C-terminus of Abf 1 p. When tested for transcriptional activation of a LacZ reporter gene, the same LexA(BD) -Abf 1 p fusion protein had negligible transcriptional activation potential. Therefore, stimulation of ARS 121 may occur independently of a transcriptional activation domain. It has been previously observed that the Gal 4 p, Rap 1 p DNA-binding sites and the LexA-Gal 4 p fusion protein can replace the role of Abf 1 p in stimulating ARS 1. Here we show that the stimulatory function of Abf 1 p at ARS 121 cannot be replaced by these alternative DNA-binding sites and the potent chimeric transcriptional activator LexA(BD) -Gal 4 (AD) p. Hence, these results strongly suggest that the Abf 1 p stimulation of replication may differ for ARS 121 and ARS 1, and imply specificity in the Abf 1 p/ARS 121 relationship...|$|E
40|$|We have {{dissected}} the autonomously replicating sequence ARS 121 using site-directed {{in vitro}} mutagenesis. Three domains important for <b>origin</b> <b>function</b> were identified; {{one of these}} is essential and contains an 11 -base-pair sequence resembling the canonical ARS core consensus; the second region, deletion of which affects the efficiency of the origin, is located 3 ' to the T-rich strand of the essential sequence and encompasses several elements with near matches to the ARS core consensus; the third region, containing two OBF 1 DNA-binding sites and located 5 ' to the essential sequence, also affects the efficiency of the ARS. Here we demonstrate that a synthetic OBF 1 DNA-binding site can substitute for the entire third domain in <b>origin</b> <b>function.</b> A dimer of the synthetic binding site, fused to a truncated origin containing only domains one and two, restored the origin activity to the levels of the wild-type ARS. The stimulation of <b>origin</b> <b>function</b> by the synthetic binding site was relatively orientation independent and could occur at distances as far as 1 kilobase upstream to the essential domain. Based on these results we conclude that the OBF 1 DNA-binding site is an enhancer of DNA replication.
