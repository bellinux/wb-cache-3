5|$|The Catholic Church {{sees the}} sacrament of {{confirmation}} as required to complete the grace given in baptism. When adults are baptised, confirmation is normally given immediately afterwards, a practice followed even with newly baptised infants in the Eastern Catholic Churches. In the West confirmation <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>is</b> delayed until they {{are old enough to}} understand or at the bishop's discretion. In Western Christianity, particularly Catholicism, the sacrament is called confirmation, because it confirms and strengthens the grace of baptism; in the Eastern Churches, it is called chrismation, because the essential rite is the anointing of the person with chrism, a mixture of olive oil and some perfumed substance, usually balsam, blessed by a bishop. Those who receive confirmation must be in a state of grace, which for those who have reached the age of reason means that they should first be cleansed spiritually by {{the sacrament of}} Penance; they should also have the intention of receiving the sacrament, and be prepared to show in their lives that they are Christians.|$|E
5|$|The law courts' {{jurisdiction}} over the guardianship <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>is</b> said {{to have come from}} the King's prerogative of parens patriae. The Chancery had administered this area of law from an early period, since it primarily concerned the holding of land– a form of trust. Since these were mainly dealt with orally there are few early records; the first reference comes from 1582, when a curator was appointed to deal with the property of an infant. While the common law courts regularly appointed guardians, the Chancery had the right to remove them, replace them or create them in the first place. Similarly, while there were actions against guardians which the child could undertake in the common law courts, these were regularly undertaken in the Court of Chancery. This jurisdiction was first regularly recognised from 1696 onwards, and its main focus was the welfare of the child. As such, wards of the court had certain principles: their estates had to be administered {{under the supervision of the}} Court, they had to be educated under the same supervision, and any marriage had to be sanctioned by the Court.|$|E

40|$|Name: The {{level of}} {{physical}} fitness and the detection of the motor skills level of primary school age children. Objectives: To find out the current level {{of physical fitness}} and basic motor skills of primary school age children. Methods: The main method of the research was an observation. The study included 54 children (8. 9 ± 0. 6 years old, 31 girls and 23 boys). For the evaluation of physical fitness, we used the Unifittest (6 - 60) and for the evaluation of motor skills was used the MABC- 2 motor test. The Student's test and the Cohen's d effect size coefficient, were used for the evaluation of group differences. Results: In the MABC- 2 motor skills test, 22 % <b>of</b> <b>children</b> achieved the result in a zone above the 84 th percentile, 20 % <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> between 51 - 84 th percentile, 50 % <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> in the range between 17 - 50 th percentile, 4 % <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> between 6 - 15 th percentile and another 4 % <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> in the range of < 5 percentile.

25|$|A {{worldwide}} 2002 {{study by}} the Norwegian Institute of Nature Research showed that 90% of victims of predatory attacks were {{children under the age}} of 18, especially under the age of 10. In the rare cases where adults were killed, the victims were almost always women. This is consistent with wolf hunting strategies, wherein the weakest and most vulnerable categories of prey are targeted. Aside from their physical inferiority, children were historically more vulnerable to wolves as they were more likely to enter forests unattended to pick berries and mushrooms, as well as tend and watch over cattle and sheep on pastures. While these practices have largely died out in Europe, they are still the case in India, where numerous attacks have been recorded in recent decades. Further reason for the vulnerability <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>is</b> the fact that some may mistake wolves for dogs and thus approach them.|$|E
