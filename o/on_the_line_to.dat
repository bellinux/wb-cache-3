5|$|With {{the advent}} of {{cladistic}} analyses, Iguanodontidae as traditionally construed was shown to be paraphyletic, and these animals are recognised to fall {{at different points in}} relation to hadrosaurs on a cladogram, instead of in a single distinct clade. Essentially, the modern concept of Iguanodontidae currently includes only Iguanodon. Groups like Iguanodontoidea are still used as unranked clades in the scientific literature, though many traditional iguanodontids are now included in the superfamily Hadrosauroidea. Iguanodon lies between Camptosaurus and Ouranosaurus in cladograms, and is probably descended from a camptosaur-like animal. At one point, Jack Horner suggested, based mostly on skull features, that hadrosaurids actually formed two more distantly related groups, with Iguanodon <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> the flat-headed hadrosaurines, and Ouranosaurus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> the crested lambeosaurines, but his proposal has been rejected.|$|E
5|$|Bull's station {{building}} {{burned down}} in 1914 {{and was replaced}} two year later by a new. By then {{it was decided that}} the line past Lysaker would be upgraded and Lysaker became the first of many stations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> be designed as an elevated station. The tracks were thereby placed elevated with an island platform with the station on the side, as the first station in Norway designed for double-track operation. The new station was designed in Baroque Revival by Adalbert Kielland at NSB Arkitektkontor. One year later the wooden bridge over Lysakerelven was replaced by a stone bridge.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the Civil War, when hostilities sharply curtailed business on the Old Bay Line, World War I doubled freight and passenger business <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> the busy ports of Norfolk and the Hampton Roads area, with 107,664 passengers using the line in 1917. As a result of congestion on the nation's railroads and ports when the U.S. entered the war in April 1917, the Federal government established the wartime U.S. Railroad Administration (USRA) {{to take charge of}} railroads and steamship companies, including the Baltimore Steam Packet Company. The USRA directed the operations of the Old Bay Line and the rival Chesapeake line {{for the duration of the}} war and more than a year thereafter, until March 1, 1920.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, a {{charging}} station for Class ETA 150 battery railcars {{was built in}} Lauterecken-Grumach. <b>The</b> latter operated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> Lauterecken but only {{until the end of}} the decade.|$|R
50|$|All trains make local stop {{at every}} station <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> Some trains {{terminate}} at Amagasaki, but most westbound trains continue <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Kobe <b>Line</b> <b>to</b> Nishi-Akashi and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Takarazuka <b>Line</b> <b>to</b> Tsukaguchi and Takarazuka. All eastbound trains continue past Kyobashi <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Gakkentoshi <b>Line.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1934, {{pantographs}} were installed, except <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> Schidlitz and Ohra. Plans <b>to</b> extend <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Bürgerwiesen (Rudnik) were scrapped. In 1935, a new tram depot by ulica Stworsza was built, and {{the tram}} depot near Mirchauer Weg was {{converted into a}} bus depot.|$|R
5|$|The {{heyday of}} the line was between 1923, when the GCR was absorbed into the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and 1948, when the LNER was nationalised to form the British Rail Eastern Region. As a result, many prestigious locomotives, such as Flying Scotsman, Sir Nigel Gresley, and Mallard which ran on the East Coast Main Line, were {{frequent}} visitors to the line. Special trains ran <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> destinations such as Scotland. The station's busiest use came after the construction of Wembley Stadium in 1923, when {{it was used to}} contain large crowds wishing to see the FA Cup Final. Special services ran from Marylebone to the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Park the following year.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{previous}} BS stations, {{a separate}} station building was not constructed at Paddington. A small pedestrian entrance on the north-west {{corner of the}} junction of London Street and Praed Street provides access to the below-ground ticket hall. Following their successful introduction at Earl's Court in 1911, the station was the first <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> be designed to use escalators instead of lifts. The ticket hall and platforms are decorated with tiling designs by David Hamilton installed during a £6 million refurbishment of the station between 1984 and 1987 incorporating elements of technical drawings by Marc Isambard Brunel and other engineers.|$|E
5|$|The Great Notch train station, {{formerly}} known as Caldwell Junction, was a small New Jersey Transit facility in the Great Notch section of Little Falls, New Jersey. The station was served seven times a day, three inbound morning trains to Hoboken Terminal and four outbound evening trains from Hoboken by the Montclair-Boonton Line from Monday to Friday. Located {{at the intersection of}} Notch Road and Long Hill Road, it was the second of three stations in Little Falls, the other two being Montclair State University and Little Falls, and was the first <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> be strictly served by diesel trains. However, most trains bypassed this station and continued on to Little Falls (westbound) and Montclair State University (eastbound). The station was served by a single track with an unused side track. The last trains stopped at the station on January 15, 2010, at 7:41pm.|$|E
50|$|The {{station is}} {{currently}} managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial {{area of the}} passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> Milan and Novara are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company.|$|R
50|$|Between 1967 and 1984 {{with the}} {{exception}} of <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> Bad Durkheim and Frankenthal via Freinsheim, all lines from Grünstadt were shut down and the station became a terminus. Its function as a railway junction was restored in 1995 with the resumption of passenger traffic <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> Eisenberg and Monsheim in the Rhineland-Palatinate integrated regular interval timetable.|$|R
50|$|Iarnród Éireann train {{services}} along <b>the</b> Dublin-Cork <b>line</b> connects <b>the</b> county between Heuston {{station and}} Cork, Limerick, {{travel through the}} county, with railway stations at Portarlington, Portlaoise and Ballybrophy. From Portarlington trains run <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Dublin-Galway/Westport/Ballina <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Athlone as well as Galway, Westport and Ballina. From Ballybrophy trains run <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Ballybrophy <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Nenagh and Limerick direct.|$|R
5|$|The Q11, Q21, Q52, and Q53 {{all share}} a route along most of Woodhaven and Cross Bay Boulevards, between Queens Boulevard in Elmhurst and Pitkin Avenue in Ozone Park. The Q11 and Q21 provide local service, while the Q52 and Q53 provide limited-stop service and extend into the Rockaways, an {{isolated}} peninsula in the south-west of Long Island which is popular {{as a summer}} retreat. The Q11 and Q21 originally corresponded to the northern (Woodhaven) and southern (Cross Bay) portions of the Boulevard respectively, while the Q53 originally made no stops along the corridor. The corridor parallels the former Rockaway Beach Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, whose northern half remains inactive and whose southern half was reactivated for rapid transit service as the IND Rockaway Line of the New York City Subway. Service <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> the Rockaways across Jamaica Bay was halted due to the 1950 fire on the Jamaica Bay trestle, and the LIRR sold the line to New York City due to its bankruptcy. The LIRR maintained service on the northern half of the line until 1962 while the NYCTA began operating subway service on the southern half in 1956.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the town was accelerated by {{the opening of the}} railway station in 1839 which stimulated the local economy and was key to the {{development of}} the Star Brewery. Initially Eastern Counties Railway services operated between Mile End and Romford, with extensions to Brentwood and to Shoreditch in 1840. A second station was opened on South Street in 1892 by the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Upminster and Grays, giving Romford a rail connection to Tilbury Docks. The two stations were combined into one in 1934. Light industry slowly developed, reaching a peak in the 1970s with a number of factories on the edge of town, such as the Roneo Vickers office machinery company, Colvern manufacturers of wireless components, May's Sheet Metal Works and brush manufacturers Betterware. Suburban expansion increased the population and reinforced Romford's position as a significant regional town centre. The Liberty Shopping Centre was constructed in the 1960s, and has been modernised and supplemented with further shopping centres throughout the town, including The Mall, opened in 1990 (as 'Liberty 2'); and The Brewery, opened in 2000 on the site of the old Star Brewery.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} line was another uncertainty for the 1997 team. Three linemen from the 1996 team {{had been selected}} in the 1997 NFL Draft: center Rod Payne (3rd round, 76th overall), offensive guard Damon Denson (4th round, 97th overall) and defensive tackle William Carr (7th round, 217th overall). As a result, Michigan began the season with only one {{offensive line}}man, offensive tackle Jon Jansen, who had started a game. Jansen, a junior, had 25 consecutive starts entering the season. The offensive line was further weakened when left tackle, Jeff Backus, suffered a ruptured appendix. In spring practice, offensive line coach Terry Malone made a plea for help during a staff meeting, searching for talent to fill in <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> <b>To</b> fill the holes on the offensive line, two defensive linemen, Steve Hutchinson and Chris Ziemann were moved to the offensive line.|$|E

2500|$|The {{proposals}} aim {{to simplify}} train operations at Manchester Piccadilly, creating close associations between pairs of lines leading {{out of the}} station and particular platforms, with few crossing moves. [...] Platforms 1 to 4 would be for services <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 'east' <b>lines,</b> <b>to</b> and from Marple, Glossop and Huddersfield; platforms 5 to 12 would be for services <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 'fast' <b>lines,</b> <b>to</b> and from Crewe and Stoke; through platforms 13 to 16 would be dedicated to services <b>on</b> <b>the</b> present 'slow' <b>lines,</b> <b>to</b> and from Manchester Airport and Hazel Grove.|$|R
50|$|A second {{track was}} {{installed}} between Winden and Maximiliansau. A second track was also installed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> Schifferstadt and Strasbourg from 1906. From this time onwards, until {{the outbreak of}} the First World War, all of the express trains coming from Ludwigshafen used this route; these previously had to detour via the Palatine Maximilian Railway.|$|R
