5|$|As {{required}} by Mexican federal law for property ownership in Coahuila y Tejas, Houston had been baptized into the Catholic {{faith in the}} Adolphus Sterne House in Nacogdoches prior to Texas independence. By 1854, when Houston told Reverend Samson he felt compelled to make a public profession of faith, perhaps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States Senate, Margaret and her family had spent 14 years influencing her husband's faith. Ultimately, he {{decided to make the}} profession among those who knew him best in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Ryan Tillman (August 11, 1847– July 3, 1918) was a {{politician}} of the Democratic Party {{who served as}} Governor of South Carolina from 1890 to 1894, and a United States Senator from 1895 {{until his death in}} 1918. A white supremacist who opposed civil rights for blacks, Tillman led a paramilitary group of Red Shirts during South Carolina's violent 1876 election. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Senate, he frequently ridiculed blacks, and boasted of having helped to kill them during that campaign.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Hayes and Komisarjevsky {{escalated}} the aggravated {{nature of}} their crimes: Komisarjevsky sexually assaulted the 11-year-old Michaela. Komisarjevsky, who had photographed the sexual assault of the girl on his cell phone, then provoked Hayes into raping Jennifer. While Hayes was raping her <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> living room, Komisarjevsky entered the room and announced that William Petit had escaped. Hayes then strangled Jennifer, doused her lifeless body {{and parts of the}} house, including the daughters' rooms, with gasoline. While tied to their beds, both daughters had been doused with gasoline; each had her head covered with a pillowcase. A fire was started, and Hayes and Komisarjevsky fled the scene. Hayley and Michaela both died of smoke inhalation.|$|E

In 1874, she bought the Stockton Weekly Leader and converted into a daily newspaper, becoming the first female publisher of a paper in the United States.

5|$|Millen {{introduced}} the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill, which provided for a paid repatriation commission and higher pensions for servicemen, into the Senate in March 1920. In {{response to the}} bill, and vigorous lobbying of Hughes by the veterans' movement, the bill faced difficulty in its passage and Senator Josiah Thomas successfully moved a resolution that a minister in one house might appear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other. This bill would have allowed Millen to address the House of Representatives, where he was facing fierce criticism from the Country Party, although ultimately neither house acted on the resolution.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper {{issued a}} formal apology, {{on behalf of}} the sitting Cabinet, in front of an {{audience}} of Indigenous delegates, and in an address that was broadcast nationally on the CBC, for the past governments' policies of assimilation. The Prime Minister apologized not only for the known excesses of the residential school system, but for the creation of the system itself. Harper delivered the speech in the House of Commons; the procedural device of a Committee of the Whole was used, so that Indigenous leaders, who were not Members of Parliament, could be allowed to respond to the apology <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House.|$|E

5|$|The Dutch stage show {{featured}} DeLange and Waylon using a specially-designed microphone {{stand to}} allow them to face each other, both playing guitars, while a bassist, a drummer and a cellist performed in the background. Low lighting was used throughout the performance, with large swooping camera shots {{at the beginning and end}} of the song implemented along with several close-ups during the rest of the performance. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stage LED screens simulated road markings, while further screens on the background showed a rainy forest scene, transforming into a dry forest scene towards the end of the song's performance.|$|E
5|$|The final lasted {{six hours}} and was played {{in front of}} a crowd of nearly 20,000 fans at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. A {{projection}} of the minimap which showed each team's map control was shown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arena between the two teams. Most of the players for Samsung Galaxy (SSG) had never played in the finals before, while most members of SK Telecom (SKT) were returning members of the 2015 championship team. It was the first finals series in a League of Legends world championship to go the full five games.|$|E
5|$|A Welsh shipbroker, W. J. Orders, {{organised}} {{a collection}} fund <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cardiff Coal Exchange and floated a public testimonial of one shilling. The national response was considerable and within weeks the total was into hundreds of pounds. This drew the Welsh Football Union (WFU) into {{a confrontation with}} the IRFB, as rule 2 on professionalism stated that no player was allowed to receive money from his club, or any member of his club, for services rendered to football. The fund could {{have been seen as}} a professional fee to Gould, henceforth making him ineligible to play for his country. The WFU argued that the money raised was not given by the club, but rather an outpouring of thanks from the Welsh public to a national hero.|$|E

5|$|Arroway falls {{unconscious}} as {{she begins}} traveling back through a wormhole. She awakens {{to find herself}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pod, the mission control team repeatedly hailing her. She learns that, from outside the machine, it appears the pod merely dropped through the machine's rings and landed in a safety net. Arroway insists that she was gone for approximately 18 hours, but her recording devices show only static. A Congressional Committee is formed and speculates that the Vega signal and machine were a hoax designed by the now-deceased Hadden. Although she cannot prove it happened, Arroway asks the committee to accept the truth of her testimony on faith. In a private conversation, Kitz and White House official Rachel Constantine reflect on confidential information that, although Arroway's recording device only recorded static, it recorded 18 hours of it. Arroway and Joss reunite, and Arroway receives ongoing financial support to expand the SETI program.|$|E
5|$|Following Desai's {{resignation}} {{and the fall}} of the Janata government headed by him, Reddy appointed Charan Singh as Prime Minister. This was on the condition that he should prove his majority <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House before the end of August. Singh was sworn in on 28 July 1979 but never faced Parliament to prove his majority when Reddy convened it on 20 August. Reddy had appointed him Prime Minister since he had produced a letter claiming to have a parliamentary majority {{with the support of the}} opposition Congress Party led by his rival, the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In return for her support, Gandhi demanded that a law establishing special courts to try her and her son Sanjay Gandhi be repealed – a proposition that was unacceptable to Charan Singh. Gandhi therefore withdrew her support, forcing Singh to resign. His government lasted 24 days and he never faced Parliament. The convention of appointing a Prime Minister in a hung House but with conditions on time to prove majority was later adopted by President R Venkataraman.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to his usually conciliatory nature, Crittenden was drawn into a disagreement between congressmen Jonathan Cilley and William J. Graves that ended in a duel. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House, Cilley had attacked the integrity of Whig newspaper editor James Watson Webb. Webb demanded a retraction of Cilley's comments through his friend, Congressman Graves. When Cilley refused to receive the communication from Graves, Graves charged that Cilley was questioning Webb's honor and challenged him to a duel. Graves, accompanied by Kentucky Congressman Richard Menefee and Virginia Congressman Richard Wise asked Crittenden {{to serve as a}} second for Graves in the duel; Crittenden initially protested, but finally agreed. After two misses by both combatants, Cilley was killed on the third exchange. The House proposed the expulsion of Graves and the censure of the other participants (excluding Crittenden, who was a senator and not subject to House censure). The resolutions of expulsion and censure were eventually tabled, but Crittenden personally felt the sting of what he considered an indirect censure and later regretted his actions.|$|E
