25|$|Trotskyism must {{be rooted}} {{out of the}} proletarian ranks of our Party as one roots out {{poisonous}} weeds. The Trotskyists must be rooted out and disposed of like wild beasts, for otherwise every time <b>our</b> <b>men</b> wish {{to go on the}} offensive {{we will not be able}} to do so due to lawlessness caused by the Trotskyists in the rear. An end must be put to these traitors once and for all so that <b>our</b> <b>men</b> on the front lines can fight without fear of being stabbed in the back.|$|E
25|$|In spring, {{our women}} {{harvested}} the supple, young shoots to make baskets. <b>Our</b> <b>men</b> fashioned the wood into pipe stems, emergency snowshoes, snares, wooden nails, whistles for the children, beading looms, and frames for stretching hides. Rotted willow wood {{was used to}} smoke hides. Green willow branches were burned to smoke meat. We twisted the inner bark fibers into temporary rope, twine and fish nets. We weather proofed rawhide by wrapping it in willow bark. We used willow branches as lathing for our houses. <b>Our</b> <b>men</b> scraped off the inner cambium layer and added other ingredients, such as bearberry, to make a smoking mixture, ‘Kinnikinick’. We repaired our carts, made a shelter when we were caught in a storm, burned for fuel and had {{a variety of other}} practical uses for the wood of the willow.|$|E

Brown said we must invest in and train <b>our</b> <b>men</b> and women when they return to their communities.|$|E
25|$|As a midshipman, Tryon {{was not an}} {{official}} member of the crew, but a supernumerary, available as spare crew for posting to other ships. He narrowly avoided a posting to Imaum, a hulk lying in Port Royal harbour which needed crew, {{which would have been}} a very unpromising start to his career. Although officially posted to that ship, he prevailed upon Lieutenant Cochran (son of Lord Dundonald) to arrange that he would remain on loan to Wellesley. Tryon started to make sketches of the places he visited, which while not very good at the start, improved steadily. In November the ship reached Halifax, where George noted, 'the other day another of <b>our</b> <b>men</b> was murdered here'. Although Wellesley was a sailing ship, it was accompanied by a paddle-wheel steamer: when the wind failed the steamer would tow the sail ship, when the wind blew well the steamer would be towed to save coal.|$|E
25|$|Just as I {{was pushing}} one of <b>our</b> <b>men</b> {{back into the}} ranks I saw him fall at my feet from a sabre slash. I turned round instantly– to see English cavalry forcing their way into our midst and hacking us to pieces. Just as it is difficult, if not impossible, for the best cavalry to break into {{infantry}} who are formed into squares and who defend themselves with coolness and daring, so {{it is true that}} once the ranks have been penetrated, then resistance is useless and nothing remains for the cavalry to do but to slaughter at almost no risk to themselves. This what happened, in vain our poor fellows stood up and stretched out their arms; they could not reach far enough to bayonet these cavalrymen mounted on powerful horses, and the few shots fired in chaotic melee were just as fatal to our own men as to the English. And so we found ourselves defenceless against a relentless enemy who, in the intoxication of battle, sabred even our drummers and fifers without mercy.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Private Plane", after {{receiving}} word that Blackadder and Baldrick {{may have been}} killed when shot down over German lines, Melchett tries to cheer George up by showing him a life-size model (measuring seventeen square feet) of land recaptured by the British, a commentary on the high human cost and small physical gains achieved by attacks in the middle years of the war. Later in the same episode, Blackadder describes the Great War as: [...] "a war {{which would be a}} damn sight simpler if we just stayed in England and shot fifty thousand of <b>our</b> <b>men</b> a week." ...|$|E
500|$|Training his new {{charges on}} Salisbury Plain, Alderson made some headway in {{toughening}} his troops encamped in the wet, autumn weather and dismissing the officers appointed by Hughes who had proved ineffectual. When Hughes' representative in England, Colonel John Wallace Carson, secured preferential accommodation for the Canadian soldiers {{at the expense}} of a British brigade, Alderson refused the barracks and in doing so, made both Carson and Hughes into determined enemies. Carson wrote to the Canadian Prime Minister Robert Laird Borden that Alderson [...] "does not treat <b>our</b> <b>men</b> with a firm iron hand covered with the velvet glove which their special temperaments require".|$|E

500|$|One of Diệm's main themes {{was that}} the {{referendum}} would usher {{in a new era}} of unprecedented democracy: [...] "This shall be but the first step made by our people in the free use of our political rights." [...] The day before the poll, Diệm said: [...] "This 23 October, {{for the first time in}} our country's history, <b>our</b> <b>men</b> and women will exercise one of many basic civil rights of a democracy, the right to vote." [...] A government proclamation four days before the poll said: [...] "Dear compatriots, proclaim your will forcefully! Go forward firmly in the path of Freedom, Independence and Democracy!" ...|$|E
500|$|Surveyors {{wrote to}} Lucas {{afterwards}} that while observing [...] "the blessings of the Sabbath," [...] Michigan militia forces advised them to retreat. In the ensuing chase, [...] "nine of <b>our</b> <b>men,</b> {{who did not}} leave the ground in time after being fired upon by the enemy, from thirty to fifty shots, were taken prisoners and carried away into [...]" [...] While {{the details of the}} attack are disputed—Michigan claimed it fired no shots and had only discharged a few musket rounds in the air as the Ohio group retreated—the battle further infuriated both Ohioans and Michiganders and brought the two sides to the brink of all-out war.|$|E
500|$|Bottomley's last public venture was an {{engagement}} at the Windmill Theatre in September 1932, where he performed a monologue of reminiscences that, according to Symons, puzzled rather than amused his audience. Following a health breakdown, {{he lived with}} Primrose in quiet poverty until his final illness. He died in the Middlesex Hospital on 26 May 1933, and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium a few days later. A large crowd heard the Revd Basil Bourchier express the hope that [...] "no one here today will forget what Mr Bottomley did to revive the spirits of <b>our</b> <b>men</b> at the Front". Four years later, in accordance with Bottomley's wishes, Primrose scattered the ashes on the Sussex Downs.|$|E

500|$|In his memoirs, Grant {{reacted to}} {{criticism}} of his lack of entrenchments: [...] "Besides this, the troops with me, officers and men, needed discipline and drill {{more than they did}} experience with the pick, shovel and axe. ... under all these circumstances I concluded that drill and discipline were worth more to <b>our</b> <b>men</b> than fortifications." [...] Lew Wallace's division was [...] downstream (north) from Pittsburg Landing, at Crump's Landing, a position intended to prevent the placement of Confederate river batteries, to protect the road connecting Crump's Landing to Bethel Station, Tennessee, and to guard the Union army's right flank. In addition, Wallace's troops could strike the railroad line connecting Bethel Station to Corinth, about [...] to the south.|$|E
500|$|Lacking in numbers, Eugene {{could not}} seriously disrupt Tallard's march but the French Marshal's {{progress}} was proving pitifully slow. Tallard's force had suffered {{considerably more than}} Marlborough's troops on their march – many of his cavalry horses were suffering from glanders and the mountain passes were proving tough for the 2,000 wagons of provisions. Local German peasants, angry at French plundering, compounded Tallard's problems, leading Mérode-Westerloo to bemoan – [...] "the enraged peasantry killed several thousand of <b>our</b> <b>men</b> before the army was clear of the Black Forest." [...] Tallard had insisted on besieging {{the little town of}} Villingen for six days (16–22 July) but abandoned the enterprise on discovering the approach of Eugene.|$|E

It {{tells the story}} of the evacuation of Dunkerque during World War II. The book received a starred review from Kirkus. Gail Murray in Boyhood in America called it [...] "moving" [...] and Children Experience Literature said it was a [...] "grimly realistic picture of warfare and its effect on both soldiers and civilians". According to the International Reading Association, while reading it [...] "children may be helped to understand that history is always someone's interpretation... For in this story the author had the courage to admit that <b>our</b> <b>men</b> were sometimes less than brave in their desperate struggle to survive".|$|E

500|$|The Texian cavalry joined their infantrymen. [...] Burleson's father, James Burleson, led a cavalry {{advance on}} the Mexican position, yelling, [...] "Boys, we have but once to die, {{they are here}} in the ditch. [...] Charge them!" [...] The Mexican {{artillery}} fired three times, driving the Texians back. [...] Three times the Mexican cavalry attempted to take a small rise to give the artillery better position; they were repulsed. [...] The Mexican infantry then attacked. [...] Rusk wrote of the Mexican attack: [...] "These men advanced with great coolness and bravery under a destructive fire from <b>our</b> <b>men,</b> preserving... strict order and exhibiting no confusion." [...] The infantry abandoned their charge when they realized that Texian James Swisher had led a band of cavalry {{to try to take}} the Mexican cannon. [...] The Mexican forces then withdrew towards Béxar.|$|E
500|$|More than 20years {{of warfare}} had eroded {{the numbers of}} {{suitable}} cavalry mounts available on the European continent; this resulted in the British heavy cavalry entering the 1815 campaign with the finest horses of any contemporary cavalry arm. British cavalry troopers also received excellent mounted swordsmanship training. They were, however, inferior to the French in manoeuvring in large formations, cavalier in attitude, and unlike the infantry some units had scant experience of warfare. The Scots Greys, for example, {{had not been in}} action since 1795. According to Wellington, though they were superior individual horsemen, they were inflexible and lacked tactical ability. [...] "I considered one squadron a match for two French, I didn't like to see four British opposed to four French: and as the numbers increased and order, of course, became more necessary I was the more unwilling to risk <b>our</b> <b>men</b> without having a superiority in numbers".|$|E
500|$|Penn's captain, Bill Hollenback, said: “This fellow Schulz is {{a monster}} {{in size and}} a perfect athlete. [...] He is both wonderfully agile and fast {{for a man of}} his size. [...] In our game with Michigan, we had two men {{instructed}} to play against Schulz and at times three and four were opposed to him. [...] For some time, he handed out as much as we passed to him in the roughing end of the game. [...] He was here, there and everywhere. He did most of the tackling. [...] He broke up innumerable plays. [...] He was the star of the contest until the continued battering of <b>our</b> <b>men</b> injured him {{to such an extent that}} he had to retire. [...] The rest was easy". [...] Coach Yost said of Schulz's performance: [...] "He gave the greatest one-man exhibition of courage I ever saw on a football field".|$|E
