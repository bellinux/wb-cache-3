5|$|The first {{locomotives}} {{constructed by}} British Railways {{were of the}} Battle <b>of</b> <b>Britain</b> class, but the naming policy reverted to the West Country for Nos. 3409134108. The final two locomotives were Battle <b>of</b> <b>Britain</b> class, No. 34109 Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory and No. 34110 66 Squadron. The result of the delay in completing was that the squadron crest for 66 Squadron was never made, as the manufacturer had retired during the intervening period. Thus 66 Squadron was the only Battle <b>of</b> <b>Britain</b> class member {{not to have a}} crest.|$|E

5|$|Arthur is {{a central}} figure in the legends making up the Matter <b>of</b> <b>Britain.</b> The legendary Arthur {{developed}} as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth's fanciful and imaginative 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings <b>of</b> <b>Britain).</b> In some Welsh and Breton tales and poems that date from before this work, Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore, sometimes associated with the Welsh Otherworld, Annwn. How much of Geoffrey's Historia (completed in 1138) was adapted from such earlier sources, rather than invented by Geoffrey himself, is unknown.|$|E

An Australian Army forestry group served in Britain between 1940 and 1943.
