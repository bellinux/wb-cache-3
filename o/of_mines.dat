In order to meet the requirements <b>of</b> <b>mining</b> applications, according to the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> environment, the paper designs and implements a hidden line removal algorithm, and applies it to 2 D views automatic generations <b>of</b> digital <b>mine,</b> both the blanking result and accuracy satisfy the requirements <b>of</b> <b>mining</b> applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper draws {{together}} {{the information that}} has been obtained on mine water recovery since the large-scale closure <b>of</b> coal <b>mines</b> in the 1980 s and 1990 s. The data show that, following cessation <b>of</b> pumping, <b>mine</b> water recovery follows an exponential curve similar to the recovery of an aquifer following a pumping test. Several previously un-published examples <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> water recovery data from around the UK {{are included in the}} paper and there is a detailed assessment <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> water ecovery in the East Fife Coalfield in Scotland. The reasons for this type <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> water ecovery are discussed and examples are given of the use of the data for both the interpretation a d modelling <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> water ecovery. In coal mining areas where no water-level recovery data are available, methods for the prediction <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> water inflow and recovery modelling are proposed and the problems associated with mine water ecovery modelling are discussed. The paper concludes that modelling <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> water ecovery, based on mine water inflow and estimated void space, can be used to give reasonably accurate predictions of recovery times and flows, but that water level monitoring is essential for precise predictions.
