5|$|Harold Innis {{wrote his}} PhD thesis <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR).

It uses voluminous statistics to underpin its arguments. Innis maintains that the difficult and expensive construction project was sustained by fears of American annexation of the Canadian West.|$|E

Louis's only childhood friends are Sibella and her brother, the children of a local doctor.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s statues were erected for the {{two leaders}} of the Dacian kingdom, Burebista and Decebalus.

Additionally two government-funded film productions were created as part of this same process. Both of the films focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> Dacia in the first and second century AD and the exploits of Decebalus, while Burebista is almost ignored.|$|E

5|$|It remains likely, however, {{that it was}} {{constructed}} by Gundulf, based primarily <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the land holdings during the period.

In practice, probably only Gundulf would therefore have had the time or motivation to build such a keep during this period.|$|E
