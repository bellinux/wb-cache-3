40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{behavior}} <b>of</b> <b>nearest</b> neighbor classification in metric spaces and provide finite-sample, distribution-dependent rates of convergence under minimal assumptions. These {{are more general}} than existing bounds, and enable us, as a by-product, to establish the universal consistency <b>of</b> <b>nearest</b> neighbor in {{a broader range of}} data spaces than was previously known. We illustrate our upper and lower bounds by introducing a new smoothness class customized for nearest neighbor classification. We find, for instance, that under the Tsybakov margin condition the convergence rate <b>of</b> <b>nearest</b> neighbor matches recently established lower bounds for nonparametric classification. ...|$|R

5|$|Academic {{standards}} and enrollment numbers at the Baltimore City College (B.C.C.) after reaching a high <b>of</b> <b>near</b> 4,000 boys by the mid-1960s {{went through a}} period of decline first in the late 1960s to mid 1970s, with the rapid opening of newer additional high schools both in the outreaches of the city along with the rapidly expanding suburbs in surrounding Baltimore County. Two in the city system were Northwestern in 1965 and Northern in the following year. Three high schools were completed and opened all at one time in September 1971, with Southwestern, Walbrook and a massive huge complex nearby to City in Clifton Park on the bed of the old reservoir off Harford Road, Lake Clifton. The 'A' and 'B' courses were slowly dying out and unfortunately discontinued by 1973, and a single academic track was offered.|$|E

40|$|Reverse nearest {{neighbor}} queries {{are useful in}} identifying objects that are of significant influence or importance. Existing methods either rely on pre-computation <b>of</b> <b>nearest</b> neighbor distances, do not scale well with high dimensionality, or do not produce exact solutions. In this work we motivate and investigate the problem <b>of</b> reverse <b>nearest</b> neighbor search on high dimensional, multimedia data. We propose exact and approximate algorithms {{that do not require}} pre-computation <b>of</b> <b>nearest</b> neighbor distances, and can potentially prune off most of the search space. We demonstrate the utility <b>of</b> reverse <b>nearest</b> neighbor search by showing how it can help improve the classification accuracy. ...|$|R

5|$|After {{becoming}} an extratropical cyclone, Chantal maintained scattered convection near its center, though its main area of convection and clouds extended to its north. Midday on August 1, the cyclone struck Newfoundland along the Avalon Peninsula, hitting the Placentia Area with full force. It subsequently intensified to attain winds <b>of</b> <b>near</b> hurricane-force. On August 3 the cyclone underwent a final weakening {{trend in the}} far northern Atlantic Ocean, and on August 5 the extratropical remnants of Chantal merged with another extratropical cyclone {{to the east of}} Iceland.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{tentatively}} appointed club physiotherapist Bertie Mee {{as acting}} manager in 1966. With new assistant Don Howe and new {{players such as}} Bob McNab and George Graham, Mee led Arsenal to their first League Cup finals, in 1967–68 and 1968–69. Next season saw a breakthrough: Arsenal's first competitive European trophy, the 1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. And the season after, an even greater triumph: Arsenal's first League and FA Cup double, and a new champions of England record. This marked a premature high point of the decade; the Double-winning side was soon broken up {{and the rest of}} the decade was characterised by a series <b>of</b> <b>near</b> misses, starting with Arsenal finishing as FA Cup runners up in 1972, and First Division runners-up in 1972–73.|$|E
5|$|At landfall, a trough was {{accelerating}} Nora northwards, {{causing it}} to reach a forward speed of 30 mph (50 km/h). Late on September 25 (UTC), still a tropical storm, it entered the continental United States at the California-Arizona state line. Nora began to weaken rapidly, and was downgraded to a tropical depression three hours later, while located between Blythe and Needles, California. Nora reached Arizona while still tropical, becoming the third known system to do so. Nora degenerated over land, and the low-level center moved towards the north-northeast. A remnant circulation aloft persisted, however, and was likely responsible for a period <b>of</b> <b>near</b> hurricane-force winds observed at the NWS Cedar City, Utah Doppler weather radar. The remnants gradually became more diffuse over the following two days while moving generally northeastward, through portions of Utah, Colorado, Idaho and Wyoming.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Alma {{was one of}} {{only four}} Atlantic {{tropical}} cyclones to reach hurricane status in the month of May. It developed on May 17, 1970 north of Panama, and rapidly intensified on May20 to peak winds <b>of</b> , <b>near</b> Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. It stalled south of Cuba and deteriorated due to wind shear, and by May22 it weakened to tropical depression status. After progressing northwestward and crossing western Cuba, Alma reorganized in the Gulf of Mexico, although continued shear prevented strengthening. It moved across Florida on May25, and on May27 it dissipated off the coast of Virginia.|$|E

In 1138, he granted permission for the castle to be built in , first mentioned in an 862 abbey charter. In the 12th to 15th centuries, however, the abbacy experienced a slow decline. In the 14th and 15th centuries, several Imperial edicts, initially issued by Emperor Charles IV, put the abbacy under the protection of the counts of Luxembourg.|$|E

In contrast to its orbit, Styx's rotation is very chaotic; like the other small Plutonian moons, Styx's rotation is not tidally locked, and it varies rapidly over short timescales (with {{a rate of about}} 3.239 days {{at the time of the}} New Horizons flyby).|$|E

5|$|Much {{progress}} has been made in the power scaling lasers and amplifiers produced with ytterbium (Yb) doped optical fibers. Power levels have increased from the 1kW regimes due to the advancements in components as well as the Yb-doped fibers. Fabrication of Low NA, Large Mode Area fibers enable achievement <b>of</b> <b>near</b> perfect beam qualities (M2<1.1) at power levels of 1.5 kW to greater than 2 kW at ~1064 nm in a broadband configuration. Ytterbium-doped LMA fibers also have the advantages of a larger mode field diameter, which negates the impacts of nonlinear effects such as stimulated Brillouin scattering and stimulated Raman scattering, which limit the achievement of higher power levels, and provide a distinct advantage over single mode ytterbium-doped fibers.|$|E

5|$|Sitta przewalskii {{is not yet}} {{treated as}} an {{independent}} species by BirdLife International or the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its threat level is not evaluated by either. Despite being described as rare in China and Southeast Tibet, because the taxon is treated instead as a subspecies of S. leucopsis, the evaluation of its population incorporates the relative abundance of its parent species. Concomitantly, it takes on its parent category of least concern. As S. przewalskii has not been extensively studied independently from S. leucopsis, a classification of data deficient could be applied, but the rarity of sightings indicates concern for its status; a finding <b>of</b> <b>near</b> threatened or even classification as a vulnerable species may be warranted.|$|E
