5000|$|A syllabic {{consonant}} or vocalic consonant is a consonant {{that forms}} a syllable on its own, like the m, n and l in the English words rhythm, button and bottle, {{or is the}} nucleus of a syllable, like the r sound in the American pronunciation of work. To represent it, the understroke diacritic in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is used, [...] It may be instead represented by an <b>overstroke,</b> [...] if the symbol that it modifies has a descender, such as in [...]|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LM), and NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) {{have been}} {{developing}} the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG) {{for use as}} a power system for space science missions. In support of this program, GRC has been involved in testing Stirling convertors, including the Advanced Stirling Convertor (ASC), for use in the ASRG. This testing includes electromagnetic interference/compatibility (EMI/EMC), structural dynamics, advanced materials, organics, and unattended extended operation. The purpose of the durability tests is to experimentally demonstrate the margins in the ASC design. Due to the high value of the hardware, previous ASC tests focused on establishing baseline performance of the convertors within the nominal operating conditions. The durability tests present the first planned extension of the operating conditions into regions beyond those intended to meet the product spec, where the possibility exists of lateral contact, <b>overstroke,</b> or over-temperature events. These tests are not intended to cause damage that would shorten the life of the convertors, so they can transition into extended operation {{at the conclusion of the}} tests. This paper describes the four tests included in the durability test sequence: 1) start/stop cycling, 2) exposure to constant acceleration in the lateral and axial directions, 3) random vibration at increased piston amplitude to induce contact events, and 4) <b>overstroke</b> testing to simulate potential failures during processing or during the mission life where contact events could occur. The paper also summarizes the analysis and simulation used to predict the results of each of these tests...|$|E
5000|$|It {{was part}} of Honda's family of first {{generation}} V4 engine motorcycles (Interceptor - VF400F VF500F VF700F VF750F VF1000F). The VF500F {{was derived from the}} Japanese market VF400F (400 cc engine). It is not simply an overbored and/or <b>overstroked</b> version of the VF400F. [...] The engine as well as the cycle are entirely specific, with very few common parts. The Honda VF500 engine was also used almost entirely unchanged in the Magna V30 standard motorcycle during the same two years.|$|R
