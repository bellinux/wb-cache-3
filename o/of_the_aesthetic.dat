5|$|Raimi {{convinced}} a local theater manager to screen the film alongside The Rocky Horror Picture Show which sparked minor interest. Initially a meager success, the film screened well to test audiences and inspired a larger budget remake directed by Raimi, called The Evil Dead (1981). The film {{was the first}} in the Evil Dead franchise, and launched the careers of both Campbell and Raimi. Several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aesthetic</b> qualities found in Within the Woods later defined Raimi's films.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, the Tower Building was renovated due to {{the efforts}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Æsthetic</b> Club, Little Rock philanthropist Frederick W. Allsop, and the Works Progress Administration. It became the new home of the Arkansas Museum of Natural History and Antiquities, which had been located in Little Rock City Hall. The museum {{remained}} in the tower building for approximately fifty-five years. The area surrounding the Tower Building had been known as Arsenal Park when the first decommissioned and then later renamed City Park. Due {{to the efforts of}} Bernie Babcock, however, the city finally named it MacArthur Park in 1942 in honor of Douglas MacArthur.|$|E
5|$|Victorian {{painting}} {{had gone}} through radical changes, and by the 1870s the realism of Etty and the Pre-Raphaelites {{had given way to}} the ideas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Aesthetic</b> Movement, abandoning the traditions of storytelling and moralising in favour of painting works designed for aesthetic appeal rather than for their narrative or subject. Although the aesthetic movement ultimately led to a brief revival of history painting, these works were in a very different style to Etty's. The new generation of history painters such as Edward Burne-Jones, Lawrence Alma-Tadema and Frederic Leighton sought to depict passivity, rather than the dynamism seen in previous works depicting the classical world. By the end of the 19th century, the value of all of Etty's works had fallen below their original prices. As the 20th century began, the increasingly influential Modernist movement, which came to dominate British art in the 20th century, drew its inspiration from Paul Cézanne and had little regard for 19th-century British painting.|$|E

25|$|Full-thickness nasal defects are {{in three}} types: (i) wounds {{to the skin}} and to the soft tissues, {{featuring}} either exposed bone or exposed cartilage, or both; (ii) wounds extending through the nasal skeleton; and (iii) wounds traversing all three nasal layers: skin, muscle, and the osseo-cartilaginous framework. Based upon the dimensions (length, width, depth) and topographic locale of the wound {{and the number of}} missing nasal-tissue layers, the surgeon determines the rhinoplastic technique for correcting a full-thickness defect; each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aesthetic</b> nasal subunits is considered separately and in combination.|$|E
25|$|Each Fratelli Ruffatti organ is unique.The tonal {{planning}} of each instrument takes {{into consideration the}} ideas and musical needs of the customer {{as well as the}} space available and the acoustic environment. The primary objective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aesthetic</b> design is to blend with the existing architecture. Although most Ruffatti instruments utilize the traditional mechanical action, they also produce instruments with electro-pneumatic and all-electric actions. While Ruffatti's continue to refine the sounds of Italian principals and flutes, they have added a wide variety of European and American organ sounds previously unknown in Italy, making their instruments international.|$|E
25|$|A wound {{measuring}} 10–15mm {{in diameter}} can be reconstructed with a single-stage modified bilobed flap, because it best matches the skin {{color and the}} skin texture of the wounded aesthetic subunit. Although not every scar can be hidden at the margins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aesthetic</b> nasal subunits concerned, the superior scarring ability of those nasal skin areas minimizes such an histologic disadvantage. In a patient whose basal-cell carcinoma was excised with Mohs surgery, the scar of the nasal reconstruction (an 11mm full-thickness, laterally based, bilobed-flap applied down to the bone and the cartilage), was hidden by aligning the axis of the second lobe to and emplacing the skin graft at the junction of the nasal dorsum and the lateral wall of the nose.|$|E

25|$|Van 't Hoff's first work on {{returning}} from the United States was the Villa Verloop – a summer house in Huis ter Heide whose design bore the unmistakable influence of Wright's Prairie Houses. More remarkable however was his next work – the Villa Henny – which was a highly idealistic and experimental house in both design and execution. One of the earliest houses to be built entirely out of reinforced concrete, the Villa Henny made full use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aesthetic</b> freedom this presented with a flat roof, overhangs, receding walls and a highly geometrical outline that presented an unambiguously modern profile compared to the rustic naturalism of his earlier designs. The Villa Henny established van 't Hoff with the international avant-garde as a major figure in the emerging modern movement, gaining an influential and appreciative review from the architect Huib Hoste in De Telegraaf and attracting {{the attention of the}} emerging De Stijl group.|$|E
25|$|The {{complete}} {{physical examination}} of the rhinoplasty patient determines {{if he or she}} is physically fit to undergo and tolerate the physiologic stresses of nose surgery. The examination comprehends every existing physical problem, and a consultation with an anaesthesiologist, if warranted by the patient's medical data. Specific facial and nasal evaluations record the patient's skin-type, existing surgical scars, and the symmetry and asymmetry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aesthetic</b> nasal subunits. The external and internal nasal examination concentrates upon the anatomic thirds of the nose—upper section, middle section, lower section—specifically noting their structures; the measures of the nasal angles (at which the external nose projects from the face); and the physical characteristics of the naso-facial bony and soft tissues. The internal examination evaluates the condition of the nasal septum, the internal and external nasal valves, the turbinates, and the nasal lining, paying special attention to the structure and the form of the nasal dorsum and the tip of the nose.|$|E
25|$|The paramedian {{forehead}} flap is {{the premier}} autologous skin graft for {{the reconstruction of}} a nose, by replacing any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aesthetic</b> nasal subunits, especially regarding the problems of different tissue thickness and skin color. The forehead flap is an axial skin flap based upon the supraorbital artery (an ophthalmic artery branch) and the supratrochlear artery (an ophthalmic artery terminus), which can be thinned to the subdermal plexus {{in order to enhance}} the functional and aesthetic outcome of the nose. Restricted length is a practical application limit of the paramedian forehead flap, especially when the patient has a low frontal hairline. In such a patient, a small portion of scalp skin can be included to the flap, but it does have a different skin texture and does continue growing hair; such mismatching is avoided with the transverse emplacement of the flap along the hairline; yet that portion of the skin flap is random, and so risks a greater incidence of necrosis.|$|E

500|$|The aesthete, {{according}} to Kierkegaard's model, will eventually {{find himself in}} [...] "despair", a psychological state (explored further in Kierkegaard's The Concept of Anxiety and The Sickness Unto Death) that results from {{a recognition of the}} limits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aesthetic</b> approach to life. Kierkegaard's [...] "despair" [...] is a somewhat analogous precursor of existential angst. The natural reaction is to make an eventual [...] "leap" [...] to the second phase, the [...] "ethical," [...] which is characterized as a phase in which rational choice and commitment replace the capricious and inconsistent longings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aesthetic</b> mode. [...] Ultimately, for Kierkegaard, the aesthetic and the ethical are both superseded by a final phase which he terms the [...] "religious" [...] mode. This is introduced later in Fear and Trembling.|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, Kierkegaard {{was a close}} reader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aesthetic</b> {{works of}} Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and the ethical works of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.

500|$|Mouly's {{approach}} was hands-on, {{and she gave}} great attention to {{every step of the}} printing process.

[...] Mouly was also hands-on when dealing with contributors, suggesting ideas and changes—an approach anathema to the editor-adverse underground spirit, but artists welcomed her input as in the end she did not interfere with their autonomy.|$|E

500|$|Holst {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} The Planets in 1913, {{partly as a result}} of his interest in astrology, and also from his determination, despite the failure of Phantastes, to produce a large-scale orchestral work. The chosen format may have been influenced by Schoenberg's Fünf Orchesterstücke, and shares something <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aesthetic,</b> Matthews suggests, of Debussy's Nocturnes or La mer. Holst began composing The Planets in 1914; the movements appeared not quite in their final sequence; [...] "Mars" [...] was the first to be written, followed by [...] "Venus" [...] and [...] "Jupiter". [...] "Saturn", [...] "Uranus" [...] and [...] "Neptune" [...] were all composed during 1915, and [...] "Mercury" [...] was completed in 1916.|$|E
500|$|The {{historian}} Terry Measham {{wrote that}} the Drawing Room and Lady Bute's Bedroom, [...] "so powerful in their effect, {{are the two most}} important interiors in the castle." [...] The architectural writer Andrew Lilwall-Smith considered the Drawing Room to be [...] "Burges's pièce de résistance", encapsulating his [...] "romantic vision of the Middle Ages". The decoration of the ceiling, which was carried out while Burges was alive, differs in tone from the treatment of the murals, and the decoration of Lady Bute's Bedroom, which were both completed, under the direction of William Frame and Horatio Lonsdale respectively, after Burges's death. Burges's work is distinctively High Gothic in style, while the later efforts are more influenced by the softer colours and character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Aesthetic</b> movement, which had grown in popularity by the 1880s.|$|E
500|$|Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI {{has proven}} Noer's most {{controversial}} film, although {{until his death}} in 1995 the director remained publicly ambivalent. The film's visuals have generally received positive reviews, but its use for propaganda and historical accuracy have been widely condemned. The Indonesian director Hanung Bramantyo praised the film's style, stating that close-up shots of men smoking were [...] "brilliant" [...] and that, at times, he felt [...] "it's not a film. But real!" [...] The director Monty Tiwa likewise praised the film's shots, citing a scene where Pandjaitan's daughter cries hysterically as her father is shot as [...] "full of drama and using a shot [...] never seen before in an Indonesian film". Sen and Hill, however, find [...] "none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aesthetic</b> hallmarks" [...] of the director's other works.|$|E
50|$|During {{his stay}} at Shantiniketan, {{he came in}} close contact with Rabindranath Tagore and other {{prominent}} figures of Bengali literature.
