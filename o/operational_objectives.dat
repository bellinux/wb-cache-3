5|$|By October Axis <b>operational</b> <b>objectives</b> in Ukraine and the Baltic {{region were}} achieved, {{with only the}} sieges of Leningrad and Sevastopol continuing. A major {{offensive}} against Moscow was renewed; after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow, where the exhausted troops were forced to suspend their offensive. Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives: two key cities remained in Soviet hands, the Soviet capability to resist was not broken, and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military potential. The blitzkrieg phase {{of the war in}} Europe had ended.|$|E

25|$|To {{mask the}} <b>operational</b> <b>objectives,</b> the Second Army {{initiated}} a deception plan that included diversionary attacks launched by XII and XXX Corps. The three armoured divisions moved to their staging positions {{west of the}} Orne only at night and in radio silence; artillery fire was used to mask {{the noise of the}} tank engines. During the hours of daylight all efforts were made to camouflage the new positions.|$|E

25|$|No one had {{anticipated}} such a rapid Allied advance. Troops were fatigued by weeks of continuous combat, Allied supply lines were stretched extremely thin, and supplies were dangerously depleted. While the supply situation improved in October, the manpower situation was still critical. General Eisenhower {{and his staff}} chose the Ardennes region, held by the First Army, as an area that could be held by as few troops as possible. The Ardennes area was chosen {{because of a lack}} of <b>operational</b> <b>objectives</b> for the Allies, the terrain offered good defensive positioning, roads were lacking, and the Germans were known to be using the area within Germany to the east as a rest and refit area for their troops.|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, {{the battle}} was one {{instance}} in which Moller's and Seydlitz's awareness of Frederick's <b>operational</b> <b>objectives</b> led to battlefield success. [...] For example, not content with the single attack and recall, the coup de main, Seydlitz withdrew his squadrons into a copse, where they regrouped under cover of the trees. When the moment was right, he led his cavalry forward again in the coup de grâce, the finishing blow. Similarly, Moller's artillery waited on the reverse angle of the hill until the French were in range, then mounted the Janus and laid down a thorough and precise pattern of artillery fire; the concussion of Moller's thorough cannonade could be felt several miles away. Rossbach proved that the column {{as a means of}} tactical deployment on battlefield was inferior to the Prussian battle line; the massed columns simply could not hold in the face of either Moller's fire or Seydlitz's cavalry charges. The greater the formation of men, the greater the loss of life and limb.|$|E
500|$|The Egyptian General Staff {{divided the}} Yemen War into three <b>operational</b> <b>objectives.</b> The {{first was the}} air phase, it began with jet {{trainers}} modified to strafe and carry bombs and ended with three wings of fighter-bombers, stationed near the Saudi-Yemeni border. Egyptian sorties went along the Tiahma Coast of Yemen and into the Saudi towns of Najran and Jizan. It was designed to attack royalist ground formations and substitute the lack of Egyptian formations {{on the ground with}} high-tech air power. In combination with Egyptian air strikes, a second operational phase involved securing major routes leading to San'a, and from there secure key towns and hamlets. The largest offensive based on this operational tactic was the March 1963 [...] "Ramadan Offensive" [...] that lasted until February 1964, focused on opening and securing roads from San'a to Sadah to the North, and San'a to Marib to the East. The success of the Egyptian forces meant that royalist resistance could take refuge in hills and mountains to regroup and carry out hit-and-run offensives against republican and Egyptian units controlling towns and roads. The third strategic offensive was the pacification of tribes and their enticement to the republican government, meaning the expenditures of massive amounts of funds for humanitarian needs and outright bribery of tribal leaders.|$|E

50|$|First, an <b>operational</b> <b>objective</b> {{should be}} specific, focused, well defined and clear enough rather than vague so that {{employees}} {{know what to}} achieve via the work. A specific objective should state the expected actions and outcomes. This would help to prevent the possibility of employees working for different goals.|$|R

Major Hans-Georg Lueder, the commander of [...] (Heavy Tank Battalion 501) was severely wounded and the detachment lost so many tanks, that it ceased {{to be an effective}} fighting force. None of the Axis <b>operational</b> <b>objectives</b> were met, despite some ground having been gained in the west and the battle cost the Germans the initiative; at best they had only slightly delayed an Allied offensive. The divisions needed for the attack of the 1st Italian Army on the Eighth Army, were delayed for a week by the failure of Unternehmen Ochsenkopf and the Battle of Medenine was a costly failure. Allfrey was promoted to Major-General on 9 March. An Axis success would have meant the loss of Béja and the retirement of the Allied line along the northern sector, including a withdrawal from Medjez el Bab, which would have prolonged the campaign and interfered with Allied plans for the Allied invasion of Sicily.|$|E

5000|$|In business, <b>operational</b> <b>objectives</b> (also {{known as}} {{tactical}} objectives) are short-term goals whose achievement brings an organization closer to its long-term goals.

[...] <b>Operational</b> <b>objectives</b> are usually set by middle managers for the next six to twelve months based on an organisation’s aim.
