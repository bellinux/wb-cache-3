5|$|During the summer, the American white ibis roams {{along the}} coast of tidal flats and {{mangrove}} swamps as the inland marshes are usually flooded. However, as the water level recedes in the fall, populations at the coast shift their foraging area inland, to inland marshes and swamplands. It has become more common in urban landscapes in Florida since the late 1990s, and is {{one of a number of}} wetland-dependent bird species which forages in man-made ponds <b>on</b> <b>golf</b> courses in the southwest of the state.|$|E
5|$|Taft upset some {{progressives}} {{by choosing}} Hitchcock as Chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), placing him {{in charge of}} the presidential campaign. Hitchcock was quick to bring in men closely allied with big business. Taft took an August vacation in Hot Springs, Virginia, where he irritated political advisors by spending more time <b>on</b> <b>golf</b> than strategy. After seeing a newspaper photo of Taft taking a large swing at a golf ball, Roosevelt warned him against candid shots.|$|E

5|$|The third {{biological}} control agent to target Neoscapteriscus in Florida was the South American nematode Steinernema scapterisci. Small-scale releases proved it could persist for years in mole-cricket-infested sandy Florida soils. Its use as a biopesticide against Neoscapteriscus was patented, making it attractive to industry. Industrial-scale production on artificial diet allowed large-scale trial applications in pastures and <b>on</b> <b>golf</b> courses, which succeeded in establishing populations in several counties, and these populations spread, but sales were disappointing, and the product was withdrawn from the market in 2014.|$|E
5|$|At lower Reynolds numbers, such {{as those}} seen with model aircraft, it is {{relatively}} easy to maintain laminar flow. This gives low skin friction, which is desirable. However, the same velocity profile which gives the laminar boundary layer its low skin friction also causes it to be badly affected by adverse pressure gradients. As the pressure begins to recover over the rear part of the wing chord, a laminar boundary layer will tend to separate from the surface. Such flow separation causes a large increase in the pressure drag, since it greatly increases the effective size of the wing section. In these cases, it can be advantageous to deliberately trip the boundary layer into turbulence at a point prior to the location of laminar separation, using a turbulator. The fuller velocity profile of the turbulent boundary layer allows it to sustain the adverse pressure gradient without separating. Thus, although the skin friction is increased, overall drag is decreased. This is the principle behind the dimpling <b>on</b> <b>golf</b> balls, as well as vortex generators on aircraft. Special wing sections have also been designed which tailor the pressure recovery so laminar separation is reduced or even eliminated. This represents an optimum compromise between the pressure drag from flow separation and skin friction from induced turbulence.|$|E
5|$|Ficus rubiginosa {{was first}} {{cultivated}} in the United Kingdom in 1789, {{where it is}} grown in glasshouses. It is commonly used as a large ornamental tree in eastern Australia, in the North Island of New Zealand, and also in Hawaii and California, where it is also listed as an invasive species in some areas. It is useful as a shade tree in public parks and <b>on</b> <b>golf</b> courses. Not as prodigious as other figs, F. rubiginosa is suited to slightly more confined areas, such as lining car parks or suburban streets. However, surface roots can be large and intrusive and the thin bark readily damaged when struck. Tolerant of acid or alkaline soils, it is hardy to US Hardiness Zones 10B and 11, reaching 10m (35ft) high in 30 years. Planting trees 8–12m (30–40ft) apart will eventually result in a continuous canopy. The trees are of great value in providing fruit for birds and mammals, though drop large quantities of fruit and leaves, leaving a mess underfoot.|$|E

25|$|Grass <b>on</b> <b>golf</b> courses is kept {{in three}} {{distinct}} conditions: that of the rough, the fairway, and the putting green. Grass on the fairway is mown short and even, allowing the player to strike the ball cleanly. Playing from the rough is a disadvantage because the long grass may affect the flight of the ball. Grass on the putting green is the shortest and most even, ideally allowing the ball to roll smoothly over the surface. An entire industry revolves around the development and marketing of grass varieties for golf courses.|$|E
25|$|Growing up in Lambton, Germiston, South Africa, he played, rugby, cricket, tennis, and {{starting}} at age 8 golf. He was a skilled junior tennis player {{and won the}} Eastern Transvaal Junior Championships at age 13. Els first learned the game of golf from his father Neels, a trucking executive, at the Germiston Golf golf course, He was soon playing better than his father (and his older brother, Dirk), and {{by the age of}} 14 he was a scratch handicap. It was around this time that he decided to focus exclusively <b>on</b> <b>golf.</b>|$|E
25|$|Parker paid {{no serious}} {{attention}} to cricket in his childhood, preferring to concentrate <b>on</b> <b>golf.</b> He only took to cricket around 1900 and was recommended to Gloucestershire by W. G. Grace in 1903. However, he played only twice in first-class cricket before 1907. From then on, he played regularly, and despite several excellent performances, {{he was always}} overshadowed by George Dennett until World War I put a halt to county cricket. By 1914, Parker had not taken 100 wickets in a season and his last two years had been very expensive, suggesting that his was to be an insignificant career.|$|E

25|$|Although Federal {{tax records}} show that various Indian tribes donated more than $6 million to the Capital Athletic Foundation, less than 1% of the money went to {{athletic}} programs, the stated purpose of the foundation. The majority of the funds went to the Eshkol Academy in Maryland, an Orthodox Jewish school founded by Abramoff in 2002. Hundreds {{of thousands of dollars}} from CAF were also spent <b>on</b> <b>golf</b> trips to Scotland for Abramoff, Ney, Reed, and Safavian, as well as purchases of camping equipment sent to a high school friend. Abramoff solicited Safavian's help in looking for property deals for Eshkol Academy and tribal clients, leading to Safavian's conviction.|$|E
25|$|He was {{introduced}} to golf at an exceptionally young age by his father, who coached him. Gerry McIlroy is a fine golfer himself, who once played at a scratch handicap level. He asked his father virtually every day {{to take him to}} Holywood Golf course. Family lore relates that he received a new golf club as a present, being shown the correct grip by his father, then taking the club to bed with him that night, with his hands holding the club properly. McIlroy joined Holywood Golf Club and became the youngest member at the club. A video <b>on</b> <b>golf</b> technique produced by champion Nick Faldo was his early favourite.|$|E
25|$|Around 1980, red {{imported}} {{fire ants}} began spreading throughout the West Indies, {{where they were}} first reported in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Between 1991 and 2001, the ant was recorded from Trinidad and Tobago, several areas in the Bahamas, the British Virgin Islands, Antigua, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. Since then, red imported fire ants have been recorded on more islands and regions, with new populations discovered in: Anguilla, Saint Martin, Barbuda, Montserrat, Saint Kitts, Nevis, Aruba, and Jamaica. The ants recorded from Aruba and Jamaica have only been found <b>on</b> <b>golf</b> courses; these courses import sod from Florida, so such importation {{may be an important}} way for the ant to spread throughout the West Indies.|$|E
