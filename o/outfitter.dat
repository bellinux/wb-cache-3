The most common <b>outfits</b> are made with silk, satin, cotton and brocades decorated with silver or gold. Stationery stores generally sell the most traditional of <b>outfits</b> and the more expensive ones. However, these <b>outfits</b> are most commonly bought in traditional open markets called “tianguis.” [...] Here, more original ones can be found and can include various saints, pre-Hispanic dress, mariachis, soccer players and ethnic dress of various nationalities. Custom orders are also taken. Some priests frown upon the non-traditional <b>outfits</b> and only want white.

25|$|Fred and John Lillywhite, as well {{as their}} elder brother, James (b. 1825), all went into {{business}} as sports outfitters.

40|$|Figure 1 : <b>Outfit</b> {{optimization}} {{with different}} input dress codes. Left: An input human body with hair color, eye color, and skin color specified, plus a wardrobe of clothing items. Right: Optimized <b>outfits</b> for dress code Casual and Business. We present an automatic optimization approach to <b>outfit</b> synthesis. Given the hair color, eye color, and skin {{color of the}} input body, plus a wardrobe of clothing items, our <b>outfit</b> synthesis system suggests a set of <b>outfits</b> subject to a particular dress code. We introduce a probabilistic framework for modeling and applying dress codes that exploits a Bayesian network trained on example images of real-world <b>outfits.</b> Suitable <b>outfits</b> are then obtained by optimizing a cost function that guides the selection of clothing items to maximize the color compatibility and dress code suitability. We demonstrate our approach on the four most common dress codes: Casual, Sportswear, Business-Casual, and Business. A perceptual study validated on multiple resultant <b>outfits</b> demonstrates the efficacy of our framework...|$|R
50|$|Under Accardo's {{leadership}} in the late 1940s, the <b>Outfit</b> moved into slot machines and vending machines, counterfeiting cigarette and liquor tax stamps and expanded narcotics smuggling.

In Las Vegas, The <b>Outfit</b> took influence over gaming away from the five crime families of New York City. Accardo made sure that all the legal Las Vegas casinos used his slot machines. In Kansas and Oklahoma, Accardo {{took advantage of the}} official ban on alcohol sales to introduce bootlegged alcohol. The <b>Outfit</b> eventually dominated organized crime in most of the Western United States. To reduce the <b>Outfit's</b> exposure to legal prosecution, Accardo phased out some traditional organized crime activities, such as labor racketeering and extortion. He also converted the <b>Outfit's</b> brothel business into call girl services. The result of these changes was a golden era of profitability and influence for the <b>Outfit.</b>|$|R
