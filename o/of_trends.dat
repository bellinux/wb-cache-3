5|$|Next {{studies of}} the {{chemistry}} of dubnium were reported over a decade later, in 1988. Studies at Berkeley examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated nitric acid; then, its sorption of dubnium on glass cover slips was {{compared with that of}} tracers of the group 5 elements niobium and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced on‐line under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces while the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. However, it was surprising that behavior on extraction from mixed nitric acid/hydrofluoric acid solution into methyl isobutyl ketones differed between dubnium, tantalum, and niobium. Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum, indicating that details of complexing behavior could not be predicted based only on simple extrapolations <b>of</b> <b>trends</b> within a group in the periodic table.|$|E

According to the census, 61% or urban households had {{access to water}} connections in their home, while according to the DHS the same figure was 70%. For rural areas the order is reversed.

25|$|A triple-blind {{study is}} an {{extension}} of the double-blind design; the monitoring committee response variables is not told the identity of the groups. The committee is simply given data for groups A and B. A triple-blind study has the theoretical advantage of allowing the monitoring committee to evaluate the response variable results more objectively. This assumes that appraisal of efficacy and harm, as well as requests for special analyses, may be biased if group identity is known. However, in a trial where the monitoring committee has an ethical responsibility to ensure participant safety, such a design may be counterproductive since in this case monitoring is often guided by the constellation <b>of</b> <b>trends</b> and their directions. In addition, by the time many monitoring committees receive data, often any emergency situation has long passed.|$|E

25|$|Motion {{pictures}} {{have been}} {{an important aspect of}} urban culture since 1910. The places where people have watched films, from the nickelodeon to the multiplex, have changed in ways that reflect changes in the society generally. The cinema in Edmonton reflected the changing urban landscape. Because the movie houses themselves are part of the entertainment product, the cinema industry follows a cycle of construction, renovation, and demolition. The industry's face is constantly changing in an effort to draw people inside; Edmonton's cinemas have moved with the retail industry from the downtown core to the suburban shopping malls, and are now experimenting with new formats similar to retailers' big boxes. Just as Edmonton is known for massive amounts of retail space, it also {{has one of the highest}} numbers of movie screens in Canada in proportion to its population. Cinemas are thus a revealing aspect <b>of</b> <b>trends</b> in urban development.|$|E
25|$|Special {{arrangements}} {{were made to}} allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with the Orleans Collection mostly housed in a wing of the Palais Royal in Paris, which could be visited {{for most of the}} 18th century. In Italy the art tourism of the Grand Tour became a major industry from the Renaissance onwards, and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible. The British Royal Collection remains distinct, but large donations such as the Old Royal Library were made from it to the British Museum, established in 1753. The Uffizi in Florence opened entirely as a gallery in 1765, though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants' offices for a long time before. The building now occupied by the Prado in Madrid was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in Vienna, Munich and other capitals. The opening of the Musée du Louvre during the French Revolution (in 1793) as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art, transferring ownership to a republican state, but was a continuation <b>of</b> <b>trends</b> already well established.|$|E

40|$|What is the {{definition}} <b>of</b> <b>trending</b> topic? Trending topic is the topic that {{a great amount of}} people are interested in. While trending topics could be detected from the offline survey or newspaper in the past, those topics can be easily detected from online these days. The rise of new types of social networking services, such as Facebook or Twitter, has caused the accumulation of unprecedented amount of web social data. This large amount of social data attracts many researchers’ and companies’ attention since it enables to collect and monitor the social interests with reducing the time and cost for the quantitative survey. Almost all web and social networking services analyze their user created social data and detect the most popular terms that are discussed and searched by their users. The popular terms are detected and published in the list, called ‘Trending Topic’ list. Awareness and utilization <b>of</b> <b>trending</b> topics plays a crucial role in various fields, including marketing, politics, and economics. This dissertation focuses on the following three studies. The first study is to analyse the nature <b>of</b> <b>trending</b> topics and reveal the important aspects. The second study is to identify the relevance <b>of</b> <b>trending</b> topic to a target object, such as individuals or organisations. It discovers how a trending topic affects a target group or individual. The impact strength <b>of</b> a <b>trending</b> topic is closely related to the strength {{of the relationship between the}} user and the issue. Therefore, this study will propose a method to identify the relevance between users and trending topics. The last study is to develop the model that predicts the <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> <b>trending</b> topics in the future. This study focuses on the formation and fading <b>of</b> <b>trending</b> topics and the trend during this lifecycle. Moreover, the dissertation also propose a model that represents the diffusion drifting movement <b>of</b> <b>trending</b> topic among different online communitie...|$|R
