5|$|King Memorial Fountain is a {{fountain}} erected in 1893 with a monumental bronze statue <b>of</b> <b>Moses</b> smiting the rock for water on Mount Horeb. Four figures of Israelite slaves around the statue {{on the side}} of the mountain represent the four stages of life: infancy, youth, adulthood, and old age. The fountain is in the center of formal gardens laid out by William S. Egerton. It was a gift from Rufus H. King and was sculpted by J. Massey Rhind, who also sculpted the Philip Schuyler statue that stands at the center of the intersection of Eagle Street and Washington Avenue in front of city hall. In 1988, the statue <b>of</b> <b>Moses</b> was cleaned and applied with a wax coating to protect it from the weather, and an arm was reattached to one of the four other statues on the fountain.|$|E

The characterization results show layered {{molybdenum disulfide}} was deposited {{on the surface of}} graphene nanosheets (GNSs) and grahene oxide was reduced simultaneously. Thermogravimetric analysis results <b>of</b> <b>MoS</b> 2, GNS and MoS 2 /GNS hybrids showed that incorporation <b>of</b> <b>MoS</b> 2 increased the thermal oxidation resistance of the graphene evidently. Compared to pure epoxy resins (EP), the addition <b>of</b> <b>MoS</b> 2 /GNS hybrids into EP enhanced the onset thermal degradation temperature (Tonset) with an 53 °C increment under air atmosphere and an 18 °C increment under nitrogen atmosphere. The addition <b>of</b> <b>MoS</b> 2 /GNS hybrids endows excellent flame retardant properties to EP, confirmed by the dramatically reduced peak heat release rate value and total heat release value.

5|$|In {{the same}} year 1506, Pope Julius {{conceived}} a program to paint {{the ceiling of the}} Sistine Chapel. The walls of the chapel had been decorated twenty years earlier. The lowest of three levels is painted to resemble draped hangings and was (and sometimes still is) hung on special occasions with the set of tapestries designed by Raphael. The middle level contains a complex scheme of frescoes illustrating the Life of Christ on the right side and the Life <b>of</b> <b>Moses</b> on the left side. It was carried out by some of the most renowned Renaissance painters: Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, Perugino, Pinturicchio, Signorelli and Cosimo Rosselli. The upper level of the walls contains the windows, between which are painted pairs of illusionistic niches with representations of the first thirty-two popes. A draft by Matteo d'Amelia indicates that the ceiling was painted blue like that of the Arena Chapel and decorated with gold stars, possibly representing the zodiacal constellations. It is probable that, because the chapel was the site of regular meetings and Masses of an elite body of officials known as the Papal Chapel who would observe the decorations and interpret their theological and temporal significance, it was Pope Julius' intention and expectation that the iconography of the ceiling was to be read with many layers of meaning.|$|E
