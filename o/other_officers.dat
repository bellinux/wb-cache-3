5|$|The {{office of}} Register {{has been held}} by the Dean of Windsor since 1558. The Garter Principal King of Arms is ex officio the senior officer of the College of Arms (the heraldic {{authority}} of England), and is usually appointed from among the <b>other</b> <b>officers</b> of arms at the College. As the title suggests, Garter Principal King of Arms has specific duties as the Order's officer of arms, attending to the companions' crests and banners of arms, which are exhibited in the chapel. The Secretary, who acts as deputy to Garter in the ceremonial aspects of the Order, has since 1952 also been selected from the <b>other</b> <b>officers</b> of the College of Arms. The office of Usher is held by the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, {{who is also the}} Serjeant-at-Arms of the United Kingdom House of Lords (although his functions are more often performed there by his deputy, the Yeoman Usher).|$|E

5|$|After the battle, Steuart {{was sent}} as a {{prisoner}} of war to Charleston, South Carolina, and was later imprisoned at Hilton Head, where he and <b>other</b> <b>officers</b> were placed under the fire of Confederate artillery. The fighting at Spotsylvania was to prove the end of his brigade. Johnson's division, 6,800 strong {{at the start of the}} battle, was now so severely reduced in size that barely one brigade could be formed. On May 14 the brigades of Walker, Jones, and Steuart were consolidated into one small brigade under the command of Colonel Terry of the 4th Virginia Infantry.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the revolt}} was quickly suppressed, exaggerated reports of {{disaster}} prompted Mucianus to depart the capital with reinforcements of his own. Domitian eagerly sought {{the opportunity to}} attain military glory and joined the <b>other</b> <b>officers</b> {{with the intention of}} commanding a legion of his own. According to Tacitus, Mucianus was not keen on this prospect but since he considered Domitian a liability in any capacity that was entrusted to him, he preferred to keep him close at hand rather than in Rome.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the duel between the two ironclads, Monitor had been struck twenty-two times, {{including}} nine hits to the turret and two hits to the pilothouse. She had managed to fire forty-one shots from her pair of Dahlgren guns. Virginia had sustained ninety-seven indentations to her armor from the fire of Monitor and other ships. Neither ship had sustained any significant damage. In the opinion of Virginias commander Jones and her <b>other</b> <b>officers,</b> Monitor could have sunk their ship had she hit the vessel at the waterline.|$|E

5|$|By the {{following}} day, 29 November, the garrison's water supply had been exhausted. The {{walls of the}} fort had also collapsed and the garrison was exposed, leading to further casualties amongst the Nepali troops. Seeing the disheartened state of men, the Captain and <b>other</b> <b>officers</b> asked them to sign a pledge {{to fight to the}} last. Eighty-four soldiers signed. However, that night the Mleccha Kalanala Company, which had arrived as reinforcements and was stationed at a portico east of Nalapani, secretly abandoned their post, taking with them their arms and colours. Seeing this, some of the men who had signed the pledge followed. The 50 or 60 men that remained, overcome by the hopelessness of the situation, felt that instead of confronting certain death by remaining in the fort, it was better to escape to the hills and hold their position there. Perhaps unable to convince their commanders with words, the escaping men caught hold of their Captain and <b>other</b> <b>officers</b> by their arms, and dragged them away from the fort. Learning of this new movement, the British renewed their fire; but the Nepalese managed to cut through and make a successful escape.|$|E
