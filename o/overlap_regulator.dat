Essentially, the study established that the Environmental Policies and Strategies of Nigeria Oil and Gas Industry have impacted positively on the Nigerian environment over the years, especially in the area of awareness creation for all stake-holders. In terms of challenges, inefficiency of the regulators due to inadequacy of logistics, poor environmental data base, duplication and <b>overlaps</b> of <b>regulators</b> functions are some of the challenges identified. The prospect of {{environmental policies}} and strategies in Nigeria is generally considered to be bright, considering the fact that the industry is still evolving.

40|$|Abstract Background An {{array of}} {{experimental}} {{models have been}} developed in the small model organisms C. elegans, S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster {{for the study of}} various neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and expanded polyglutamine diseases as exemplified by Huntington's disease (HD) and related ataxias. Genetic approaches to determine the nature of regulators of the disease phenotypes have ranged from small scale to essentially whole genome screens. The published data covers distinct models in all three organisms and one important question {{is the extent to which}} shared genetic factors can be uncovered that affect several or all disease models. Surprisingly it has appeared that there may be relatively little overlap and that many of the regulators may be organism or disease-specific. There is, however, a need for a fully integrated analysis of the available genetic data based on careful comparison of orthologues across the species to determine the real extent of overlap. Results We carried out an integrated analysis using C. elegans as the baseline model organism since this is the most widely studied in this context. Combination of data from 28 published studies using small to large scale screens in all three small model organisms gave a total of 950 identifications of genetic regulators. Of these 624 were separate genes with orthologues in C. elegans. In addition, 34 of these genes, which all had human orthologues, were found to overlap across studies. Of the common genetic regulators some such as chaperones, ubiquitin-related enzymes (including the E 3 ligase CHIP which directly links the two pathways) and histone deacetylases were involved in expected pathways whereas others such as the peroxisomal acyl CoA-oxidase suggest novel targets for neurodegenerative disease therapy Conclusions We identified a significant number of <b>overlapping</b> <b>regulators</b> of neurodegenerative disease models. Since the diseases have, as an underlying feature, protein aggregation phenotypes it was not surprising that some of the overlapping genes encode proteins involved in protein folding and protein degradation. Interestingly, however, some of the overlapping genes encode proteins that have not previously featured in targeted studies of neurodegeneration and this information will form a useful resource to be exploited in further studies of potential drug-targets. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The dspA (hik 33) gene, coding for a {{putative}} sensory histidine kinase, is conserved in plastids (ycf 26) and cyanobacteria. It {{has been}} linked {{with a number of}} different stress responses in cyanobacteria. Results We constructed an insertional mutant of dspA (ycf 26) in Synechocystis 6803. We found little phenotypic effect during nitrogen starvation. However, when the mutation was combined with deletion of the pta gene coding for phosphotransacetylase, a more significant phenotype was observed. Under nitrogen starvation, the pta/dspA double mutant degrades its phycobilisomes less than the wild type and still has about half of its chlorophyll-protein complexes. Conclusion Our data indicates that acetyl-phosphate-dependent phosphorylation of response <b>regulator(s)</b> <b>overlaps</b> with DspA-dependent signalling of the degradation of chlorophyll-protein complexes (and to a lesser extent phycobilisomes) in Synechocystis 6803. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The mRNA {{expression}} {{levels of}} genes {{have been shown}} to have discriminating power for the classification of breast cancer. Studying the heritability of gene expression levels on breast cancer related transcripts can lead to the identification of shared common regulators and inter-regulation patterns, which would be important for dissecting the etiology of breast cancer. Results We applied multilocus association genome-wide scans to 18 breast cancer related transcripts and combined the results with traditional linkage scans. Regulatory hotspots for these transcripts were identified and some inter-regulation patterns were observed. We also derived evidence on interacting genetic regulatory loci shared by a number of these transcripts. Conclusion In this paper, by restricting to a set of related genes, we were able to employ a more detailed multilocus approach that evaluates both marginal and interaction association signals at each single-nucleotide polymorphism. Interesting inter-regulation patterns and significant <b>overlaps</b> of genetic <b>regulators</b> between transcripts were observed.

40|$|In December 2011, in Reference re Securities Act, the Supreme Court of Canada dashed the Canadian federal government’s {{hopes of}} being able to create a federal {{securities}} regulator. Instead, it left the constitutional jurisdiction over “day-to-day operations of the securities markets” with the provinces and allocated to the federal government responsibility for just two things: data collection, and the management of systemic risk. Our claim in this essay is that the Reference can be understood as an invitation to create a meaningful and ambitious national systemic risk regulator for the securities markets. The essay points to five recent examples (the use of derivatives by Canadian issuers; LTCM and hedge fund activity; the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper crisis in Canada; the 2010 Flash Crash and high frequency trading; and money market mutual funds) to argue that the day-to-day operations of issuers, registrants, and regulators in the capital markets are constitutive of, and inextricable from, systemic risk. Regulating systemic risk therefore requires some degree of oversight of the underlying activities, plus deep information channels into local markets. In allocating data collection responsibilities to the federal government, the Reference is giving it a potentially significant tool. The Reference opens the possibility that the federal government can create not an <b>overlapping</b> fourteenth securities <b>regulator,</b> but an active “clearinghouse” regulatory body that sets broad goals and regulatory requirements, while leaving detailed implementation of regulation to the provinces...|$|R
40|$|Complexes of RNA and RNA binding {{proteins}} form large-scale supramolecular structures under many cellular contexts. In Caenorhabditis elegans, small germ granules {{are present}} in the germ line that share characteristics with liquid droplets that undergo phase transitions. In meiotically-arrested oocytes of middle-aged hermaphrodites, the germ granules appear to aggregate or condense into large assemblies of RNA-binding proteins and maternal mRNAs. Prior characterization of the assembly of large-scale RNP structures via candidate approaches has identified a small number of regulators of phase transitions in the C. elegans germ line; however, the assembly, function, and regulation of these large RNP assemblies remain incompletely understood. To identify genes that promote remodeling and assembly of large RNP granules in meiotically-arrested oocytes, we performed a targeted, functional RNAi screen and identified over 300 genes that regulate the assembly of the RNA-binding protein MEX- 3 into large granules. Among the most common GO classes are several categories related to RNA biology, as well as novel categories such as cell cortex, ER, and chromosome segregation. We found that arrested oocytes that fail to localize MEX- 3 into cortical granules display reduced oocyte quality, consistent with the idea that the larger RNP assemblies promote oocyte quality when fertilization is delayed. Interestingly, {{a relatively small number of}} genes <b>overlap</b> with the <b>regulators</b> of germ granule assembly during normal development, or with the regulators of solid RNP granules in cgh- 1 oocytes, suggesting fundamental differences in the regulation of RNP granule phase transitions during meiotic arrest...|$|R
40|$|On August 20 and 21, 2007, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, US President George W. Bush, and Mexican President Felipe Calder 6 n met in Montebello, Quebec {{to discuss}} the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (2 ̆ 2 SPP 2 ̆ 2), a trilateral {{initiative}} that has as its objective enhanced regulatory cooperation between the three North American states {{in order to improve}} continental security and regional competitiveness. Despite being described in prosaic terms by government officials and industry supporters as a primarily technical exercise, the SPP has attracted trenchant criticism across the political spectrum. The SPP has been described variously as 2 ̆ 2 integration by stealth, 2 ̆ 2 the creation of a North American 2 ̆ 2 European Union with none of the safeguards on the environment and social rights, 2 ̆ 2 and (most floridly) as a 2 ̆ 2 [u]nion that will bury America under more than 100 million, mostly poor Mexicans, and tens of millions of Canadians, used to their lavish social welfare benefits and socialized medicine. 2 ̆ 23 Still others have dismissed the SPP altogether as a disappointing 2 ̆ 2 much ado about nothing, 2 ̆ 2 noting that it {{is little more than a}} grocery list of bureaucratic minutiae that ignores the pressing trade and social imperatives affecting the region. And so opens another front in the fight over globalization. From a governance perspective, the SPP appears to adopt on a grand scale what international legal and international relations scholars have identified as a trend towards international regulation through informal arrangements negotiated directly by domestic agencies with their foreign counterparts. In this regard, Anne-Marie Slaughter has written extensively about a 2 ̆ 2 new world order 2 ̆ 2 based on <b>overlapping</b> networks of <b>regulators</b> who seek to coordinate transnational activity and achieve common goals through direct agency-to-agency interactions. In some cases, the form of cooperation is quite minimal, such as sharing information on best regulatory practices or extending notice of regulatory activities to regulators in potentially impacted jurisdictions. However, informal cooperation efforts may evolve into more substantively prescriptive arrangements, such as regulatory harmonization, mutual recognition arrangements, and cooperative enforcement mechanisms. What distinguishes these governance structures from traditional forms of international cooperation is that network arrangements are not negotiated through central agencies such as foreign affairs departments, nor do they revolve around a formally binding treaty. Instead, cooperating regulators directly interact with one another with a view to developing shared guidelines or 2 ̆ 2 frameworks for cooperation 2 ̆ 2 to institutionalize their cooperative efforts. To use Professor Slaughter 2 ̆ 7 s phrase, the state as a relevant international actor is increasingly 2 ̆ 2 disaggregating into its separate, functionally distinct parts, 2 ̆ 2 as opposed to operating as a single, indivisible unit.
