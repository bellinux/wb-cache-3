40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} topics in the area of economics of family and household is how changes in household technology have affected both household production—the production of goods and services by household members for consumption by household members—and market production—the production of goods and services by paid labor, meant for sale. These changes have also apparently led to profound changes in consumption patterns as well as changes in time use, including women's increased participation in market production. Less obviously, but even more profoundly, they have apparently led to significant changes in our most fundamental choices regarding who we live with and how we live.

Over the course of thwarting the Sith Lord’s plans by collecting pieces of a map, called the Star Map, to the Sith fleet’s power, the player’s character (AKA “player character ” or “PC”) meets and recruits various individuals as followers in the cause. One of these followers, for example, is a Wookiee named Zaalbar who the PC meets early in the game, on the planet Taris, by rescuing him from Gamorrean 2 slavers. The act of rescuing Zaalbar causes him to pledge a life-debt to the PC, and he will then follow and support the PC in whatever causes the PC deems to undertake.
