40|$|Impurity Induced Layer Disordering (IILD) of a GaAs/AlGaAs Multi Quantum Well (MQW) {{structure}} {{is known to}} produce {{a change in the}} refractive index dependent on the polarisation of the propagating mode. This index change can be used to provide lateral confinement in <b>stripe</b> <b>optical</b> waveguides, which are an essential component in any integrated optical circuit. Silicon implantation has been used to disorder GaAs/AlGaAs MQWs and the effects of implantation dose, encapsulant and annealing conditions on the disordering process have been investigated using Photoluminescence (PL). It was observed that deep level emissions accompanied the disordering and the results suggest that the degree of intermixing and the deep level emissions were determined by several competing processes. Calculation of the deep level/band-edge integrated intensity ratio for these emissions, provided an indication of the suitability of the process for the fabrication of disorder delineated stripe waveguides, where a correlation between the propagation loss of the waveguides and the integrated intensity ratio was observed. Buried <b>stripe</b> <b>optical</b> waveguides fabricated using Si+ IILD has been demonstrated {{for the first time in}} this work. Waveguide assessment using end-fire coupling was performed with the propagation losses and modal dimensions determined. The lowest loss of a waveguide fabricated by IILD presented in this thesis is 21. 9 dBcm- 1 and it is suggested that the deep level states observed using PL are a significant source of attenuation of the propagating mode in the side walls of the waveguides...|$|R

40|$|We present {{magneto-optic}} {{measurements on}} two materials {{that form the}} recently discovered twist-bend nematic (Ntb) phase. This intriguing state of matter represents a new fluid phase that is orientationally anisotropic in three directions and also exhibits translational order with periodicity several {{times larger than the}} molecular size. NTB materials may also spontaneously form a visible, macroscopic stripe texture. We show that the <b>optical</b> <b>stripe</b> texture can be persistently inhibited by a magnetic field, and a 25 T external magnetic field depresses the N-Ntb phase transition temperature by almost 1 degree C. We propose a quantitative mechanism to account for this shift and suggest a Helfrich-Hurault-type mechanism for the <b>optical</b> <b>stripe</b> formation. Comment: 12 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|Advent of nematic liquid {{crystals}} flows {{have attracted}} renewed attention {{in view of}} microfluidic transport phenomena. Among various transport processes, electroosmosis stands {{as one of the}} efficient flow actuation method through narrow confinement. In the present study, we explore the electrically actuated flow of a nematic fluid with ionic inclusions taking into account the influences from surface induced elastic and electrical double layer phenomena. Influence of surface effects on the flow characteristics is known to get augmented in micro-confined environment and must be properly addressed. Towards this, we devise the coupled flow governing equations from fundamental free energy analysis considering the contributions from first and second-order elastic, dielectric, flexoelectric, ionic and entropic energies. We have further considered weak anchoring surface conditions with second order elasticity which helps us to more accurately capture the director deformations along the boundaries. The present study focuses on the influence of surface charge and elasticity effects in the resulting linear electroosmosis through a slit-type microchannel whose surface are considered to be chemically treated in order to display a homeotropic-type weak anchoring state. An <b>optical</b> periodic <b>stripe</b> configuration of the nematic director has been observed especially for higher electric fields wherein the Ericksen number for the dynamic study is restricted to the order of unity...|$|R
40|$|We {{review the}} static and {{dynamical}} properties of stripe textures {{with regard to}} their relevance in high-Tc superconductors. Our investigations are based on the time-dependent Gutzwiller approximation which allows for the computation of random-phase approximation-like (RPA) fluctuations on top of the Gutzwiller approximation (GA). No restrictions are imposed on the charge and spin configurations which makes the method suitable for the calculation of linear excitations around symmetry-broken solutions. Within this approach we calculate the <b>optical</b> conductivity of <b>stripes</b> and compare our results with reflectivity experiments on cuprates. Furtheron we use the spin-rotational invariant extension of the GA + RPA method in order to investigate the characteristics of magnetic excitations in the stripe phase of cuprates. Our results are in very good agreement with neutron scattering and optical experiments on lanthanum cuprate superconductors...|$|R
40|$|Previously we {{developed}} a low-cost, multi-configurable handheld response system, using a reflective-type intensity modulated fiber-optic sensor (FOS) [1] to accurately gather participants' behavioral responses during {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI). Inspired by the popularity and omnipresence of the fingertip-based touch sensing user interface devices, in this paper we present the design of a prototype fMRI-compatible <b>optical</b> touch <b>stripe</b> (OTS) as an alternative configuration. The prototype device takes advantage of a proven frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) technique. By using a custom-built wedge-shaped optically transparent acrylic prism as an optical waveguide, and a plano-concave lens to provide the required light beam profile, the position of a fingertip touching the surface of the wedge prism can be determined from the deflected light beams that become trapped within the prism by total internal reflection. To achieve maximum sensitivity, the optical design of the wedge prism and lens were optimized through a series of light beam simulations using WinLens 3 D Basic software suite. Furthermore, OTS performance and MRI-compatibility were assessed on a 3. 0 Tesla MRI scanner running echo planar imaging (EPI) sequences. The results show that the OTS can detect a touch signal at high spatial resolution (about 0. 5 cm), and is well suited for use within the MRI environment with average time-variant signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) loss <; 3 %...|$|R

40|$|Grain {{boundaries}} {{are one of}} the most significant defects in laser recystallized Si films. To obtain useable base materials for device fabrication these grain boundaries must be avoided, or at least localized, so that critical devices can be designed in defect free areas. A generally used method to localize the grain boundary formation is to modulate the temperature profile spatially during crystal growth. This can be achieved by integrated absorbers which are photolithographically defined <b>optical</b> anti-reflection <b>stripes</b> on the top of SOI or 3 D structures. Using this technique Si films free form grain boundaries of typically 20 Mym width within the area between the absorbers are obtained. However, boundaries remain under the absorber stripes. With respect to process simulation for SOI and especially 3 D applications we were involved in the modelling of grain boundary growth during laser recrystallization. Based on our numeric modelling we introduced a new concept called micro absorber to suppress the grain boundary formation even under the absorbers. Since the formation of grain boundaries may originate from stress due to the different densities of liquid and solid silicon and the geometrical non-uniformity of faceted recrystallizing film, reducing the size of facets down to some critical value may totally suppress the grain boundary formation. The first results obtained with an 18 W cw AR high + laser were satisfactory. Areas free from grain boundaries of up to 100 Mym x 50 Mym have been observed in 0, 5 Mym thick seeded SOI film using integrated absorbers of a pitch of 4 microns...|$|R
40|$|We study recent Intermediate Luminosity Optical Transients (ILOTs) {{and major}} eruptions of Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs), and {{strengthen}} claims {{for a similar}} mechanism powering both. This process is a short duration release of gravitational energy in a binary system. In some ILOTs a merger occurs {{and one of the}} stars does not survive the transient event, e. g., V 838 Mon and V 1309 Sco. In some transient events a rapid and short mass transfer process takes place and the two stars survive the transient event, e. g., the Great Eruption of Eta Carinae. We study new ILOTs and reanalyze known ones in light of new observations and models. We reach our conclusion by analyzing these ILOTs using the Energy-Time Diagram (ETD) where we plot the total energy of the eruption against its eruption timescale. ILOTs and major LBV eruptions occupy the <b>Optical</b> Transient <b>Stripe</b> (OTS) in the ETD. The upper boundary of the stripe is explained by our proposed model where a main sequence (or a slightly off-main sequence) star accretes at a very high rate (< 1 M_ yr^- 1) from a companion. We identify one LBV, NGC 3432 OT, with two eruptions; one with weak total energy and the other with large total energy. It bridges the regions of the ILOTs and LBVs in the OTS. We further study the ILOT M 85 OT 2006 and show that it cannot be a nova, even not an extreme one. We build a model where ILOTs can become optically thin in a timescale of few years and the inflated envelope collapses into an accretion disk around the star. Such an ILOT will evolve blue-ward after few years. Comment: 12 pages, 3 figures, update...|$|R
40|$|The {{implantation}} of helium ions into {{lithium niobate}} produces {{a reduction in}} its refractive indices, due to radiation damage produced {{close to the end}} of the ion trajectories. This reduction can be utilised to form the boundaries of optical waveguides, which form the basis of any integrated <b>optical</b> circuit. <b>Stripe</b> waveguide fabrication using ion implantation has been demonstrated for the first time in this work. Firstly a buried damage layer was formed to define the depth of the waveguide, followed by additional implants around a gold mask to form the waveguide sidewalls. The gold mask was used to protect the guiding region during the latter implantation process. The waveguides were evaluated using the end-fire coupling technique to excite individual modes. Propagation loss and modal dimensions were determined experimentally for the fundamental mode of each guide, and it was shown that these properties are sensitive to both the ion energy of the wall implants, and the number of wall implants. Each of these two variables affects the propagation loss in the opposite sense to the other, and therefore the lowest propagation loss becomes dependant on the trade off between these two effects. The lowest loss of the waveguides presented in this thesis was found to be ~ 1 dB/cm, and it is expected that this figure may be further reduced by the optimisation suggested in the conclusions of this work. Additional results are presented which consider the electrooptic and photorefractive properties of ion implanted LiNbO 3. Previous work of others suggested that the electrooptic effect would be considerably reduced in the implanted material, but the results were much more encouraging, showing a reduction of only ~ 20 % in the r 13 electrooptic coefficient. Furthermore, one of the most serious drawbacks of Ti:indiffused waveguides is the undesirable reduction of the output intensity due to the photorefractive effect, which has been shown not to affect the waveguides presented in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|V 2 {{has long}} been {{recognized}} to contain functionally distinguishable compartments that are correlated with the stripelike pattern of cytochrome oxidase activity. Early electrophysiological studies suggested that color, direction/disparity, and orientation selectivity were largely segregated in the thin, thick, and interstripes, respectively. Subsequent studies revealed {{a greater degree of}} homogeneity in the distribution of response properties across stripes, yet color-selective cells were still found to be most prevalent in the thin <b>stripes.</b> <b>Optical</b> recording studies have demonstrated that thin stripes contain both color-preferring and luminance-preferring modules. These thin stripe color-preferring modules contain spatially organized hue maps, whereas the luminance-preferring modules contain spatially organized luminance-change maps. In this study, the neuronal basis of these hue maps was determined by characterizing the selectivity of neurons for isoluminant hues in multiple penetrations within previously characterized V 2 thin stripe hue maps. The results indicate that neurons within the superficial layers of V 2 thin stripe hue maps are organized into columns whose aggregated hue selectivity is closely related to the hue selectivity of the optically defined hue maps. These data suggest that thin stripes contain hue maps not simply because of their moderate percentage of hue-selective neurons, but because of the columnar and tangential organization of hue selectivity...|$|R
40|$|The Optical System Simulator (OSS) {{provides}} a comprehensive {{platform for the}} analysis and design of isolated optical devices and entire optical systems, with special focus on semiconductor lasers and system exhibiting fast dynamics. The OSS is able to simulate " 1 -D" (or fundamental mode) optical devices, such as ideal <b>optical</b> sources, narrow <b>stripe</b> semiconductor lasers, wave-guides, passive cavities, mirrors, beam splitters, etc. These individual elements can be combined to form into complex optical systems.

40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} plastic (CFRP) manufacturing often is an expensive, time-consuming small-scale production {{where most of the}} products and components are characterized by complex geometric properties. Especially for hollow components it is necessary to use removable mold cores, which are typically made of low-melting metal alloys, and used to shape the inner contour of the component. To improve the time-consuming and costly process of mold-making, this paper describes the application of additive manufacturing (i. e. 3 D-printing) for the production of mold cores. The outstanding advantage of additive manufacturing is the very flexible production out of a CAD model without further tools. In the provided case study materials for additive manufacturing were selected and tested for their suitability to manufacture mold cores. For this purpose an exemplary mold core was produced with different additive manufacturing methods and used in common carbon fiber production processes. Since curing in the autoclave places the highest demands on the core, this process has been selected to test the mold cores. A special focus was on the analysis of the dimensional stability and accuracy by measuring the deviations of the inner cores after the autoclave cycle. The analysis was performed by using <b>optical</b> metrology utilising <b>stripe</b> light projection. Finally this case study shows that additive manufacturing can lead to an increase in efficiency in the CFRP production but also that further scientific research and technological development are needed to realize the indicated potentials...|$|R
40|$|Widely-used {{valuable}} hardcopy documents such as passports, visas, driving licenses, educational certificates, entrance-passes {{for entertainment}} events etc. are conventionally protected against counterfeiting and data tampering attacks by applying analog security technologies (e. g. KINEGRAMS®, holograms, micro-printing, UV/IR inks etc.). How-ever, {{easy access to}} high quality, low price modern desktop publishing technology has left most of these technologies ineffective, giving rise to high quality false documents. The higher price and restricted usage are other drawbacks of the analog document pro-tection techniques. Digital watermarking and high capacity storage media such as IC-chips, <b>optical</b> data <b>stripes</b> etc. are the modern technologies being used in new machine-readable identity verification documents to ensure contents integrity; however, these technologies are either expensive or do not satisfy the application needs and demand to look for more efficient document protection technologies. In this research three different high capacity analog channels: high density data stripe (HD-DataStripe), data hiding in printed halftone images (watermarking), and super-posed constant background grayscale image (CBGI) are investigated for hidden com-munication along with their applications in smart documents. On way to develop high capacity analog channels, noise encountered from printing and scanning (PS) process is investigated with the objective to recover the digital information encoded at nearly maximum channel utilization. By utilizing noise behaviour, countermeasures against the noise are taken accordingly in data recovery process. HD-DataStripe is a printed binary image similar to the conventional 2 -D barcodes (e. g. PDF 417), but it offers much higher data storage capacity and is intended for machine-readable identity verification documents. The capacity offered by the HD-DataStripe is sufficient to store high quality biometric characteristics rather than extracted templates, {{in addition to the}} conventional bearer related data contained in a smart ID-card. It also eliminates the need for central database system (except for backup record) and other ex-pensive storage media, currently being used. While developing novel data-reading tech-nique for HD-DataStripe, to count for the unavoidable geometrical distortions, registra-tion marks pattern is chosen in such a way so that it results in accurate sampling points (a necessary condition for reliable data recovery at higher data encoding-rate). For more sophisticated distortions caused by the physical dot gain effects (intersymbol interfer-ence), the countermeasures such as application of sampling theorem, adaptive binariza-tion and post-data processing, each one of these providing only a necessary condition for reliable data recovery, are given. Finally, combining the various filters correspond-ing to these countermeasures, a novel Data-Reading technique for HD-DataStripe is given. The novel data-reading technique results in superior performance than the exist-ing techniques, intended for data recovery from printed media. In another scenario a small-size HD-DataStripe with maximum entropy is used as a copy detection pattern by utilizing information loss encountered at nearly maximum channel capacity. While considering the application of HD-DataStripe in hardcopy documents (contracts, official letters etc.), unlike existing work [Zha 04], it allows one-to-one contents matching and does not depend on hash functions and OCR technology, constraints mainly imposed by the low data storage capacity offered by the existing analog media. For printed halftone images carrying hidden information higher capacity is mainly attributed to data-reading technique for HD-DataStripe that allows data recovery at higher printing resolution, a key requirement for a high quality watermarking technique in spatial domain. Digital halftoning and data encoding techniques are the other factors that contribute to data hiding technique given in this research. While considering security aspects, the new technique allows contents integrity and authenticity verification in the present scenario in which certain amount of errors are unavoidable, restricting the usage of existing techniques given for digital contents. Finally, a superposed constant background grayscale image, obtained by the repeated application of a specially designed small binary pattern, is used as channel for hidden communication and it allows up to 33 pages of A- 4 size foreground text to be encoded in one CBGI. The higher capacity is contributed from data encoding symbols and data reading technique...|$|R
