25|$|According to R. J. Rummel, {{genocide}} has 3 different meanings. The <b>ordinary</b> <b>meaning</b> {{is murder}} by government of people {{due to their}} national, ethnic, racial, or religious group membership. The legal meaning of genocide refers to the international treaty, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG). This also includes non-killings {{that in the end}} eliminate the group, such as preventing births or forcibly transferring children out of the group to another group. A generalized meaning of genocide is similar to the <b>ordinary</b> <b>meaning</b> but also includes government killings of political opponents or otherwise intentional murder. It is to avoid confusion regarding what meaning is intended that Rummel created the term democide for the third meaning.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} meaning theory, which {{is closely related}} to textualism, is the view that interpretation of a written constitution or law should be based on what reasonable persons living {{at the time of its}} adoption would have understood the <b>ordinary</b> <b>meaning</b> of the text to be. Most originalists, such as Justice Scalia, are associated with that view.|$|E
25|$|According to R. J. Rummel, {{genocide}} {{has multiple}} meanings. The <b>ordinary</b> <b>meaning</b> is murder {{by a government}} of people due to their national, ethnic, racial, or religious group membership. The legal meaning is defined by CCPG. This includes actions such as preventing births or forcibly transferring children to another group. Rummel created the term democide to include assaults on political groups.|$|E
40|$|According to {{psychological}} emotion theories {{referred to as}} appraisal theory, emotions are caused by appraisals (evaluative judgments). Borrowing a term from Jan Smedslund, it is the contention of this article that psychological appraisal theory is “pseudoempirical” (i. e., misleadingly or incorrectly empirical). In the article I outline what makes some scientific psychology “pseudoempirical,” distinguish my view on this from Jan Smedslund’s, {{and then go on}} to show why paying heed to the <b>ordinary</b> <b>meanings</b> of emotion terms is relevant to psychology, and how appraisal theory is methodologically off the mark by employing experiments, questionnaires, and the like, to investigate what follows from the <b>ordinary</b> <b>meanings</b> of words. The overarching argument of the article is that the scientific research program of appraisal theory is fundamentally misguided and that a more philosophical approach is needed to address the kinds of questions it seeks to answer...|$|R

500|$|Lords Bingham and Mance, dissenting, {{took the}} view that the Order in Council was {{unreasonable}} and therefore invalid. Bingham noted that the proper way to interpret an exercise of the royal prerogative was to look at how it had been exercised previously, and that he could not find any previous record of the prerogative being used to [...] "exile an indigenous population from its homeland". [...] He argued that this prerogative power did not exist: [...] "he Crown has never had a prerogative power to prevent its subjects from entering the Kingdom, or to expel them from it". Accordingly, the Order was ultra vires. Bingham also maintained that it was irrational, since visits to the outer islands did not threaten US security, and unacceptable, in that no consideration had been given to the Chagossians. On the subject of legitimate expectation, the dissenters maintained that the statement should be [...] "construed according to the <b>ordinary</b> <b>meaning</b> that would be attached to it by those, principally the Chagossians and their supporters, to whom it was directed"; Bingham saw the <b>ordinary</b> <b>meaning</b> as being that the Chagossians would be allowed to return home.|$|E
500|$|The crux of {{the case}} was the {{interpretation}} of [...] "homelessness" [...] under the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977, under which a public authority bore a statutory responsibility for providing homeless people with accommodation. The House of Lords ruled that the applicants, who were a married couple living with their two children in a single room in a guest house, were not [...] "homeless" [...] within the <b>ordinary</b> <b>meaning</b> of that expression, and thus were not entitled to relief under the Act.|$|E
500|$|Some chemists {{treat the}} {{categories}} [...] "d-block elements" [...] and [...] "transition metals" [...] interchangeably, thereby including groups 3–12 among the transition metals. In this instance the group 12 elements {{are treated as}} a special case of transition metal in which the d electrons are not ordinarily involved in chemical bonding. The 2007 report of mercury(IV) fluoride (HgF4), a compound in which mercury would use its d electrons for bonding, has prompted some commentators to suggest that mercury {{can be regarded as}} a transition metal. |journal=Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. |year=2007 |volume=46 |issue=44 |pages=8371–8375 |doi=10.1002/anie.200703710 |pmid=17899620}} Other commentators, such as Jensen, have argued that the formation of a compound like HgF4 can occur only under highly abnormal conditions; indeed, its existence is currently disputed. As such, mercury could not be regarded as a transition metal by any reasonable interpretation of the <b>ordinary</b> <b>meaning</b> of the term.|$|E

5000|$|Words of {{purchase}} are words the grantor used to designate the grantee on a deed, will, or probate that determine {{who is to}} receive the interest.The term words {{of purchase}} is a technical conveyancing expression, a term of art in real property law {{that has nothing to}} do with the <b>ordinary</b> <b>meanings</b> of the word [...] "purchase." [...] The word purchase in the expression means that real property is being transferred by deed or will, not inherited through the laws of descent and distribution.|$|R
500|$|Philip Sales and Richard Ekins {{are among}} those that believe that section 3 has not {{displaced}} the purpose of interpretation [...] to discern parliamentary intention. In their eyes, section 3 is about [...] "how interpreters are to infer that intention". They also criticise the [...] "judicial lawmaking" [...] because it applies to the case in hand, concluding that this breaks the non-retroactivity commonly {{considered part of the}} rule of law, although it is sometimes necessary. They also note that rules made by courts are not transparent, because their new interpretation under section 3 differs from their <b>ordinary</b> <b>meaning</b> [...] after all, section 3 must go beyond standard interpretation. This leaves citizens uncertain of what the law is. Sales and Ekins also suggest that while applying section 3 to post-Human Rights Act legislation might be merely using a presumption that the legislature intended to follow it, applying it to pre-Human Rights Act legislation cannot possibly base itself on such an inference. Section 3, though, still allows them to do so.|$|E

2500|$|Nix v. Hedden, , was a {{decision}} by the Supreme Court of the United States that, under U.S. customs regulations, the tomato should be classified as a vegetable rather than a fruit.

2500|$|A third {{consequence}} of switching to tetrahedral mensuration was Fuller's {{review of the}} standard [...] "dimension" [...] concept. Whereas [...] "height, width and depth" [...] have been promulgated as three distinct dimensions within the Euclidean context, {{each with its own}} independence, Fuller considered the tetrahedron a minimal starting point for spatial cognition. His use of [...] "4D" [...] was in many passages close to synonymous with the <b>ordinary</b> <b>meaning</b> of [...] "3D," [...] with the dimensions of physicality (time, mass) considered additional dimensions.|$|E
2500|$|Formalist {{definitions}} identify mathematics {{with its}} symbols {{and the rules}} for operating on them. Haskell Curry defined mathematics simply as [...] "the science of formal systems". A formal system {{is a set of}} symbols, or tokens, and some rules telling how the tokens may be combined into formulas. In formal systems, the word axiom has a special meaning, different from the <b>ordinary</b> <b>meaning</b> of [...] "a self-evident truth". In formal systems, an axiom is a combination of tokens that is included in a given formal system without needing to be derived using the rules of the system.|$|E
2500|$|Butler {{writes that}} {{though there was}} no direct search and seizure in Boyd v. United States, the Court still found such {{exercise}} as occurred in that case to be in violation of the constitutional protections afforded to the criminal defendant. The Court does not limit its decisions to the literal meaning of the words of the Constitution. [...] "Under the principles established and applied by this court, the Fourth Amendment safeguards against all evils that are like and equivalent to those embraced within the <b>ordinary</b> <b>meaning</b> of its words." [...] Thus, when all these facts are evaluated, Butler concludes [...] "with great deference," [...] that the petitioners should be given a new trial.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning with Rooth, {{the effects}} of focus on {{semantics}} {{can be said to}} be the introduction of a set of alternatives that contrasts with the <b>ordinary</b> semantic <b>meaning</b> of a sentence. Consider the following example: ...|$|R

2500|$|In contrast, the Vaisheshika school {{gives an}} atomic {{theory of the}} {{physical}} world on the non-atomic ground of ether, space and time. (See Indian atomism.) The basic atoms are those of earth (prthivı), water (apas), fire (tejas), and air (vayu), that {{should not be confused with}} the <b>ordinary</b> <b>meaning</b> of these terms. These atoms are taken to form binary molecules that combine further to form larger molecules. Motion is defined in terms of the movement of the physical atoms. Light rays are taken to be a stream of high velocity of tejas (fire) atoms. The particles of light can exhibit different characteristics depending on the speed and the arrangements of the tejas atoms. Around the first century BC, the Vishnu Purana refers to sunlight as [...] "the seven rays of the sun".|$|E
2500|$|The High Court {{examined}} {{the law in}} various Commonwealth jurisdictions, noting that the test used for determining whether a person is guilty of scandalizing contempt is the real risk test. Under this test, the threshold for liability is [...] "a real risk, {{as opposed to a}} remote possibility". The Court also noted reservations that the Hong Kong Court of First Instance had brought up in implementing the real risk test. First, the test should be given its <b>ordinary</b> <b>meaning</b> – a real risk does not mean that it is more probable than not to occur, but instead means [...] "a good chance as opposed to a mere possibility". Secondly, the impugned words must relate [...] "to the section of the public whose confidence in the administration of justice must be affected".|$|E
2500|$|First, Stevens {{observed}} that the arbitration clause was in the sales procedure agreement, to which Chrysler as well Soler and Mitsubishi were party. It only applied to two-party disputes, yet Soler's antitrust claim was against both manufacturers. [...] "Only by stretching {{the language of the}} arbitration clause far beyond its <b>ordinary</b> <b>meaning</b> could one possibly conclude that it encompasses this three-party dispute." [...] Second, it only covered five of the 15 articles of the contract, and none of those five addressed areas which had given rise to Soler's antitrust claim. [...] "The federal policy favoring arbitration cannot sustain the weight that the Court assigns to it. A clause requiring arbitration of all claims 'relating to' a contract surely could not encompass a claim that the arbitration clause was itself part of a contract in restraint of trade." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{can find}} no warrant for giving the words 'grievous bodily harm' a meaning other than that which the words convey in their <b>ordinary</b> natural <b>meaning.</b> 'Bodily harm' needs no explanation, and 'grievous' means no more and no less than 'really serious'.|$|R
5000|$|In {{deciding}} whether possessing a firearm {{in either the}} glove compartment or the trunk {{should be included in}} the statutory definition of “carries” the Court employed a lengthy discussion of the linguistics and <b>ordinary</b> <b>meanings</b> of the phrase “carries a firearm.” [...] The majority debated over the possible ways to define the phrase but ultimately ruled that the Congress intended for the word “carries” to be defined in its original, etymological meaning that would include conveying a gun in a vehicle and not necessarily on one’s person. The Court did not make this ruling lightly and rested its reasoning on sources of literature, excerpts of New York Times articles, and multiple dictionaries to examine how the phrase has been used.|$|R
50|$|Where {{the meaning}} of a {{contract}} remains unclear despite application of the primary rules (whereby the court establishes the intention of the parties by considering the <b>ordinary</b> grammatical <b>meaning</b> of the words in their textual and extra-textual context), the courts use various further canons of construction.|$|R
