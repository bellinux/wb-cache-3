5|$|A {{variety of}} new {{sketches}} were also added, including Sweaty Betty's Burger Bar and QCV' (Quite Cheap Value), a parody <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> channel QVC which saw Cawood and Suttie as fictitious presenters Hilary and Ursula, two garishly dressed middle aged women with a strong dislike for each other who would try to promote a useless product whilst making snide digs at each other underneath forced smiles and insincere laughter.|$|E
5|$|May 28, 2007 saw {{the opening}} of phase one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> mall {{and part of the}} 600-meter promenade.

5|$|Most {{stations}} on the Bloor–Danforth line have side platforms; however, {{there are}} still a few stations which use a centre platform instead. At the surface, some stations are designed to be a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> area which are located above the subway. Other stations are large facilities on the surface which also contain bus and/or streetcar platforms to allow transfers to take place.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> front facade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> has {{a central}} doorway, {{with a large}} timber-framed four-panel window to <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> door. <b>The</b> western side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> also has a timber {{double-door}} entrance. A metal window hood is located above the sash window at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> western wing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rear section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shop.</b>|$|R
60|$|Just then, a cry {{was raised}} {{that there were}} two kegs of {{gunpowder}} in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shops</b> on <b>the</b> ground floor. <b>The</b> owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> came up in a frantic state, and corroborated this statement.|$|R
50|$|The {{ground floor}} {{accommodates}} {{a real estate}} agent's office and a health food <b>shop.</b> <b>The</b> polished timber floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> comprises dark timber planks alternated with light coloured timber. A set of timber box shelves extends <b>the</b> full length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> to <b>the</b> ceiling along the southern side. A recently installed counter runs along the opposite side. Commercial refrigerators are positioned along <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shop.</b> <b>The</b> ceiling {{is made up of}} fibrous cement sheeting with painted or stained timber battens laid out in a decorative pattern.|$|R
5|$|Pearl's {{favorite}} {{activities are}} socializing at the Bikini Bottom Mall, and using her father's credit card {{to buy anything}} that is in style. Mr. Krabs disapproves of Pearl's prodigal spending, but nonetheless pays for her items to avoid disappointing his daughter. Pearl is employed as an assistant at Grandma's Apron, a store for elderly residents {{on the ground floor}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> center. Beatrice, her boss at Grandma's Apron, is voiced by actress Betty White.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} London Overspill plan, along wth {{places such}} as Ashford and Swindon, Basingstoke was rapidly {{developed}} in the late 1960s as an 'expanded town', in similar fashion to Milton Keynes. Many office blocks and large estates were built, including a ring road. The shopping centre was built in phases. The first phase was completed by the 1970s and was later covered in the 1980s, and was known as The Walks. The second phase was completed by the early 1980s, and became The Malls. The third phase was abandoned and the site was later used to build the Anvil concert hall. The central part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> centre was rebuilt in 2002 and reopened as Festival Place. This has brought a dramatic improvement to shoppers' opinions of the town centre, but it is unclear if it has softened the town's overall image.|$|E
5|$|Brady and Hindley {{visited a}} {{fairground}} on 26 December 1964, {{in search of}} another victim, and noticed 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey standing beside one of the rides. When {{it became apparent that}} she was on her own, they approached her and deliberately dropped some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> they were carrying close to her, before asking for the girl's help to carry some of the packages to their car, and then to their home. Once inside the house Downey was undressed, gagged and forced to pose for photographs before being raped and killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string. Hindley maintained that she went to fill a bath for the child and found the girl dead (presumably killed by Brady) when she returned. In Chris Cowley's book Face to Face with Evil: Conversations with Ian Brady, Brady states that it was Hindley who killed Downey. The following morning Brady and Hindley drove with Downey's body to Saddleworth Moor, where she was buried, naked with her clothes at her feet, in a shallow grave.|$|E

50|$|By 1863, <b>the</b> <b>shops</b> in Susquehanna {{employed}} 700 men (up {{from the}} original 350) in the community with $38,000/year average salary. <b>The</b> master mechanic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shops,</b> James Gregg worked to renovate and improve <b>the</b> <b>shops,</b> which were consistent fire risks. Construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shops</b> began that year at <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> $1.25 million (1865 USD) along with $500,000 in tools and machinery along 8 acres.|$|R
5|$|The {{idea that}} Bristol's main {{shopping}} area should be {{moved away from}} the Castle Street and Wine Street area was first proposed to Bristol Corporation's Planning and Reconstruction Committee by the Multiple Traders' Federation (MTF), representing the larger retailers and chain-stores, in October 1943. They suggested that the pre-war shopping area should be set aside as a civic area with perhaps a concert hall or similar building and an open space, and that the central shopping area should be moved to a less-constrained site. This suggestion formed part of the City Engineer's Master Plan of February 1944, which envisaged that the area would contain a limited number of buildings such as a conference hall, with underground parking for 2,000 cars. The removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> area was considered desirable because the fire that had destroyed so much of the area was in large part sustained by its congested nature, and in any case many of the chain-stores represented by the MTF wanted larger sites.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{there were}} further {{developments}} from a leisure perspective adjacent to JD Wetherspoon, {{consisting of a}} nightclub named 'Crush', a bar, restaurant and a takeaway unit in the Grange Central area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shopping</b> Centre.|$|E

25|$|From {{the heart}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> centre, it is {{approximately}} 7.5 kilometres to Sydney's central business district, measured {{in a straight}} line from the original Sydney General Post Office in Martin Place.

25|$|At the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> {{district}} {{there is}} an intersection, with a statue of a bull, called Altıyol (Six Ways), where a road leads to the civic buildings and a huge street market called Salı Pazarı (Tuesday Market).

25|$|Super Saturday is {{the last}} Saturday before Christmas, a major day of revenue for American retailers, marking the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> season they and many {{customers}} believe begins on Black Friday.

25|$|The Shopping Centre {{occupies}} an area {{close to}} the old town wall, which followed the course of Blackett Street. This means the modern shopping centre is built {{on either side of}} where the wall once stood. From a map drawn by Charles Hutton in 1770, it appears that the ancient wall would have run parallel with the south side of Blackett street. This is the northernmost wall of the South portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> centre.|$|E

25|$|That same afternoon, Bulger, {{from nearby}} Kirkby, went with his mother, Denise, to the New Strand Shopping Centre. While inside the A.R.
