40|$|The {{success of}} <b>oligonucleotide</b> <b>ligation</b> <b>assays</b> in probing {{specific}} sequences of DNA arises {{in large part}} from high enzymatic selectivity against base mismatches at the ligation junction. We describe here {{a study of the}} effect of mismatches on a new non-enzymatic, reagent-free method for <b>ligation</b> of <b>oligonucleotides.</b> In this approach, two oligonucleotides bound at adjacent sites on a complementary strand undergo autoligation by displacement of a 5 '-end iodide with a 3 '-phosphorothioate group. The data show that this ligation proceeds somewhat more slowly than ligation by T 4 ligase, but with substantial discrimination against single base mismatches both at either side of the junction and a few nucleotides away within one of the oligonucleotide binding sites. Selectivities of > 100 -fold against a single mismatch are observed in the latter case. Experiments at varied concentrations and temperatures are carried out both with the autoligation of two adjacent linear oligonucleotides and with intramolecular autoligation to yield circular 'padlock' DNAs.

Methods: The synthetic control monitored 32 cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator mutations and polymorphisms simultaneously. Participants of a cystic fibrosis external quality assessment scheme were invited to analyze the quality control. Results: In total, 58 laboratories participated in this study. Twenty-seven (47 %) laboratories detected 32 variants; another 27 laboratories (47 %) detected from 31 to 4 variants and 4 participants reported no variants (6 %).

We screened the CYSLTR 1 gene on chromosome Xq 13 - 21 for coding region polymorphisms, and investigated their associations with allergy and asthma. METHODS: Solid-phase chemical cleavage was used to screen polymorphisms in the coding region of CYSLTR 1. A TaqMan allelic discrimination assay was used to genotype a 927 T/C SNP and <b>oligonucleotide</b> <b>ligation</b> <b>assays</b> were used to genotype the previously reported 617 T/C and 898 G/A SNPs of CYSLTR 1 in 341 asthmatic families from the UK.

40|$|With the {{identification}} of common single locus point mutations as risk factors for thrombophilia, many DNA testing methodologies have been described for detecting these variations. Traditionally, functional or immunological testing methods {{have been used to}} investigate quantitative anticoagulant deficiencies. However, with the emergence of the genetic variations, factor V Leiden, prothrombin 20210 and, to a lesser extent, the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR 677) and factor V HR 2 haplotype, traditional testing methodologies have proved to be less useful and instead DNA technology is more commonly employed in diagnostics. This review considers many of the DNA techniques that have proved to be useful in the detection of common genetic variants that predispose to thrombophilia. Techniques involving gel analysis are used to detect {{the presence or absence of}} restriction sites, electrophoretic mobility shifts, as in single strand conformation polymorphism or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and product formation in allele-specific amplification. Such techniques may be sensitive, but are unwielding and often need to be validated objectively. In order to overcome some of the limitations of gel analysis, especially when dealing with larger sample numbers, many alternative detection formats, such as closed tube systems, microplates and microarrays (minisequencing, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and <b>oligonucleotide</b> <b>ligation</b> <b>assays)</b> have been developed. In addition, many of the emerging technologies take advantage of colourimetric or fluorescence detection (including energy transfer) that allows qualitative and quantitative interpretation of results.

40|$|The {{effort of}} the past year''s activities, which covers {{the first year of}} the project, was {{directed}} at developing DNA-based diagnostic procedures for implementation in high through-put analytical instrumentation. The diagnostic procedures under evaluation are designed to identify specific genes in soil microorganisms that code for pollutant-degrading enzymes. Current DNA-based diagnostic procedures, such as the ligase chain reaction (LCR) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), rely on gel electrophoresis as a way to score a diagnostic test. The authors are attempting to implement time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry as a replacement for gel separations because of its speed advantage and potential for sample automation. The authors anticipate that if TOF techniques can be implemented in the procedures, then a very large number of microorganisms and soil samples can be screened for the presence of specific pollutant-degrading genes. The use of DNA-based procedures for the detection of biodegrading organisms or genes that code for pollutant-degrading enzymes constitutes a critical technology for following biochemical transformation and substantiating the impact of bioremediation. DNA-based technology has been demonstrated to be a sensitive technique for tracking micro-organism activity at the molecular level. These procedures can be tuned to identify groups of organisms, specific organisms, and activity at the molecular level. They are developing a P-monitoring strategy that relies on the combined use of DNA diagnostics with mass spectrometry as the detection scheme. The intent of this work is a two-fold evaluation of (1) the feasibility of replacing the use of gel separations for identifying polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products with a rapid and automatable form of electrospray mass spectrometry and (2) the use of matrix-assisted-laser-desorption-ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) as a tool to score <b>oligonucleotide</b> <b>ligation</b> <b>assays</b> (OLA). ...|$|R
40|$|A common {{strategy}} for genotyping large samples {{begins with the}} characterization of human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by sequencing candidate regions in a small sample for SNP discovery. This is usually followed by typing in a large sample those sites observed to vary in a smaller sample. We present results from a systematic investigation of variation at the human apolipoprotein E locus (APOE), {{as well as the}} evaluation of the two-tiered sampling strategy based on these data. We sequenced 5. 5 kb spanning the entire APOE genomic region in a core sample of 72 individuals, including 24 each of African-Americans from Jackson, Mississippi; European-Americans from Rochester, Minnesota; and Europeans from North Karelia, Finland. This sequence survey detected 21 SNPs and 1 multiallelic indel, 14 of which had not been previously reported. Alleles varied in relative frequency among the populations, and 10 sites were polymorphic in only a single population sample. <b>Oligonucleotide</b> <b>ligation</b> <b>assays</b> (OLA) were developed for 20 of these sites (omitting the indel and a closely-linked SNP). These were then scored in 2179 individuals sampled from the same three populations (n[*]=[*] 843, 884, and 452, respectively). Relative allele frequencies were generally consistent with estimates from the core sample, although variation was found in some populations in the larger sample at SNPs that were monomorphic in the corresponding smaller core sample. Site variation in the larger samples showed no systematic deviation from Hardy-Weinberg expectation. The large OLA sample clearly showed that variation in many, but not all, of OLA-typed SNPs is significantly correlated with the classical protein-coding variants, implying that there may be important substructure within the classical ɛ 2, ɛ 3, and ɛ 4 alleles. Comparison of the levels and patterns of polymorphism in the core samples with those estimated for the OLA-typed samples shows how nucleotide diversity is underestimated when only a subset of sites are typed and underscores the importance of adequate population sampling at the polymorphism discovery stage...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Our {{ultimate}} goal is to detect the entire human microbiome, in health and in disease, in a single reaction tube, and employing only commercially available reagents. To that end, we adapted molecular inversion probes to detect bacteria using solely a massively multiplex molecular technology. This molecular probe technology does not require growth of the bacteria in culture. Rather, the molecular probe technology requires only a sequence of forty sequential bases unique to the genome of the bacterium of interest. In this communication, we report the first results of employing our molecular probes to detect bacteria in clinical samples. Results While the assay on Affymetrix GenFlex Tag 16 K arrays allows the multiplexing of the detection of the bacteria in each clinical sample, one Affymetrix GenFlex Tag 16 K array must be used for each clinical sample. To multiplex the clinical samples, we introduce a second, independent assay for the molecular probes employing Sequencing by <b>Oligonucleotide</b> <b>Ligation</b> and Detection. By adding one unique oligonucleotide barcode for each clinical sample, we combine the samples after processing, but before sequencing, and sequence them together.

40|$|Background. Intrapartum single-dose {{nevirapine}} plus third trimester {{maternal and}} infant zidovudine are essential components of programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) in resource-limited settings. The persistence of nevirapine in the plasma for 3 weeks postpartum risks selection of resistance mutations to nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). We hypothesized that a 1 -month zidovudine-didanosine course initiated {{at the same time}} as single-dose nevirapine (sdNVP) would prevent the selection of nevirapine-resistance mutations. Methods. HIV-infected pregnant women in the PHPT- 4 cohort with CD 4 cell counts > 250 cells/mm(3) received antepartum zidovudine from the third trimester until delivery, sdNVP during labor, and a 1 -month zidovudine-didanosine course after delivery. These women were matched on the basis of baseline HIV load, CD 4 cell count, and duration of antepartum zidovudine to women who received sdNVP in the PHPT- 2 trial (control subjects). Consensus sequencing and the more sensitive <b>oligonucleotide</b> <b>ligation</b> <b>assay</b> were performed on samples obtained on postpartum days 7 - 10, 37 - 45, and 120 (if the HIV load was > 500 copies/mL) to detect K 103 N/Y 181 C/G 190 A mutations. Results. The 222 PHPT- 4 subjects did not differ from matched control subjects in baseline characteristics except for age. The combined group median CD 4 cell count was 421 cells/mm(3) (interquartile range [IQR], 322 - 549 cells/mm 3), the median HIV load was 3. 45 log(10) copies/mL (IQR, 2. 79 - 4. 00 log(10) copies/mL), and the median duration of zidovudine prophylaxis was 10. 4 weeks (IQR, 9. 1 - 11. 4 weeks). Using consensus sequencing, major NNRTI resistance mutations were detected after delivery in 0 % of PHPT- 4 subjects and 10. 4 % of PHPT- 2 controls.

40|$|Abstract Background Aside from single {{nucleotide}} polymorphisms, copy number variations (CNVs) {{are the most}} important factors in susceptibility to genetic disorders because they affect expression levels of genes. In previous studies, pyrosequencing, mini-sequencing, real-time PCR, invader assays and other techniques have been used to detect CNVs. However, the higher the copy number in a genome, the more difficult it is to resolve the copies, so a more accurate method for measuring CNVs and assigning genotype is needed. Results PCR followed by a quantitative <b>oligonucleotide</b> <b>ligation</b> <b>assay</b> (qOLA) was developed for quantifying CNVs. The accuracy and precision of the assay were evaluated for porcine KIT, which was selected as a model locus. Overall, the root mean squares of bias and standard deviation of qOLA were 2. 09 and 0. 45, respectively. These values are less than half of those in the published pyrosequencing assay for analyzing CNV in porcine KIT. Using a combined method of qOLA and another pyrosequencing for quantitative analysis of KIT copies with spliced forms, we confirmed the segregation of KIT alleles in 145 F 1 animals with pedigree information and verified the correct assignment of genotypes. In a diagnostic test on 100 randomly sampled commercial pigs, there was perfect agreement between the genotypes obtained by grouping observations on a scatter plot and by clustering using the nearest centroid sorting method implemented in PROC FASTCLUS of the SAS package. In a test on 159 Large White pigs, there were only two discrepancies between genotypes assigned by the two clustering methods (98. 7 % agreement), confirming that the quantitative ligation assay established here makes genotyping possible through the accurate measurement of high KIT copy numbers (> 4 per diploid genome). Moreover, the assay is sensitive enough for use on DNA from hair follicles, indicating that DNA from various sources could be used. Conclusion We have established a high resolution quantification method using an <b>oligonucleotide</b> <b>ligation</b> <b>assay</b> to measure CNVs, and verified the reliability of genotype assignment for random animal samples using the nearest centroid sorting method. This new method will make it more practical to determine KIT CNV and to genotype the complicated Dominant White/KIT locus in pigs. This procedure could have wide applications for studying gene or segment CNVs in other species. </p...|$|E

50|$|The {{limitations}} {{with the}} hybridization-ligation assay {{also apply to}} the dual <b>ligation</b> <b>assay,</b> with the 5'-end {{in addition to the}} 3'-end requiring to have a free hydroxyl (or a phosphate group). Further, T4 DNA ligases are incompatible with ligation of RNA molecules as a donor (i.e. RNA at the 5' end of the ligation). Therefore, second generation antisense that comprise 2'-O-methyl RNA, 2'-O-methoxyethyl or locked nucleic acids may not be compatible with the dual <b>ligation</b> <b>assay.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 678 {{individuals}} from 28 European bovine breeds were both phenotyped and analysed at the myostatin locus by the Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) method. Seven new mutations were identified which {{contribute to the}} high polymorphism (1 SNP every 100 bp) present in this small gene; twenty haplotypes were described and a genotyping method was set up using the <b>Oligonucleotide</b> <b>Ligation</b> <b>Assay</b> (OLA) method. Some haplotypes appeared to be exclusive to a particular breed; {{this was the case}} for 5 in the Charolaise (involving mutation Q 204 X) and 7 in the Maine-Anjou (involving mutation E 226 X). The relationships between the different haplotypes were studied, thus allowing to test the earlier hypothesis on the origin of muscular hypertrophy in Europe: muscular hypertrophy (namely m 821 (del 11)) was mainly spread in different waves from northern Europe milk purpose populations in most breeds; however, other mutations (mostly disruptive) arose in a single breed, were highly selected and have since scarcely evolved to other populations.

40|$|We {{describe}} a non-isotopic, semi-automated method for large-scale multiplex analysis of nucleic acid sequences, using the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene as an example. Products of a multiplex <b>oligonucleotide</b> <b>ligation</b> <b>assay</b> (OLA) are resolved electrophoretically {{from one another}} and from unligated probes under denaturing conditions with fluorescence detection. One ligation probe for each OLA target carries a fluorescent tag, while the other probe carries an oligomeric non-nucleotide mobility modifier. Each OLA product has a unique electrophoretic mobility determined by the ligated oligonucleotides and the mobility-modifier oligomer arbitrarily assigned (coded) to its target. The mobility range for practical mobility modifiers is much wider than the accessible range from unmodified ligated oligonucleotides of practical length. Each mobility modifier is built from phosphoramidite monomers in a stepwise manner on its associated oligonucleotide using an automated synthesizer. The resulting mobility modifiers lower the probe-target duplex Tm by less than 3 degrees C and retard probe-target annealing by less than 50 %, with negligible effect on OLA yield and specificity. This method is especially useful for allelic discrimination in highly polymorphic genes such as CFTR...|$|E
40|$|Background: Knock-down {{resistance}} (kdr) to DDT and pyrethroids in {{the major}} Afrotropical vector species, Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, is associated with two alternative point mutations at amino acid position 1014 of the voltage-gated sodium channel gene, resulting in either a leucine-phenylalanine (L 1014 F), or a leucine-serine (L 1014 S) substitution. In An. gambiae S-form populations, the former mutation appears to be widespread in west Africa and has been recently reported from Uganda, while the latter, originally recorded in Kenya, has been recently found in Gabon, Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea. In M-form populations surveyed to date, only the L 1014 F mutation has been found, although less widespread and at lower frequencies than in sympatric S-form populations. Methods: Anopheles gambiae M-and S-form specimens from 19 sites from 11 west and west-central African countries were identified to molecular form and genotyped at the kdr locus either by Hot <b>Oligonucleotide</b> <b>Ligation</b> <b>Assay</b> (HOLA) or allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR). Results: The kdr genotype was determined for about 1, 000 An. gambiae specimens. The L 1014 F allele was found at frequencies ranging from 6...|$|E
40|$|Proximity <b>ligation</b> <b>assay</b> (PLA) {{is a novel}} protein {{detection}} strategy {{based on}} the transformation of detected proteins into DNA sequences through a DNA ligation reaction (1 – 6). This conversion of protein into DNA strands is followed by DNA amplification and detection, for example, by quantitative PCR or rolling circle amplification (RCA).
