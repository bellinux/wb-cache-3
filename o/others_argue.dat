5|$|As a {{description}} of the origin of the universe, the Big Bang has significant bearing on religion and philosophy. As a result, it {{has become one of the}} liveliest areas in the discourse between science and religion. Some believe the Big Bang implies a creator, and some see its mention in their holy books, while <b>others</b> <b>argue</b> that Big Bang cosmology makes the notion of a creator superfluous.|$|E
5|$|Coke's meaning {{has been}} disputed over the years; some {{interpret}} his judgment as referring to {{judicial review of}} statutes to correct misunderstandings which would render them unfair, while <b>others</b> <b>argue</b> he meant that the common law courts {{have the power to}} completely strike down those statutes they deem to be repugnant.|$|E
5|$|Free {{hydrochloric}} acid was first formally {{described in the}} 16th century by Libavius, who prepared it by heating salt in clay crucibles. Other authors claim that pure {{hydrochloric acid}} was first discovered by the German Benedictine monk Basil Valentine in the 15th century, when he heated common salt and green vitriol, whereas <b>others</b> <b>argue</b> {{that there is no}} clear reference to the preparation of pure hydrochloric acid {{until the end of the}} 16th century.|$|E
25|$|Lee and <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> that snakes {{were the}} {{descendants}} of mosasaurs.|$|R
25|$|Schultz and <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> {{that the}} type {{specimen}} of Apatomerus mirus was not actually a pterosaur fossils.|$|R
25|$|Hone and <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> {{that the}} crests of many {{pterosaur}} species were {{a result of}} mutual sexual selection.|$|R
5|$|Hetch Hetchy {{represented}} {{the first great}} environmental controversy in the US, and debate over the dam and reservoir continues today. Preservationist {{groups such as the}} Sierra Club lobby for the restoration of the valley, while <b>others</b> <b>argue</b> that leaving the dam in place would be the better economic and environmental decision.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} {{debate whether}} the Ming dynasty had sovereignty over Tibet. Some {{believe it was}} a relationship of loose suzerainty that was largely cut off when the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–67) persecuted Buddhism in favor of Daoism at court. <b>Others</b> <b>argue</b> that the significant religious nature of the relationship with Tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship. Others note the Ming need for Central Asian horses and the need to maintain the tea-horse trade.|$|E
5|$|<b>Others</b> <b>argue</b> {{that there}} is no {{available}} evidence that demonstrates that any of these organisms are capable of causing aphthous stomatitis by themselves. Some people with aphthous stomatitis may show herpes virus within the epithelium of the mucosa, but without any productive infection. In some persons, attacks of ulceration occur {{at the same time as}} asymptomatic viral shedding and elevated viral titres. However, antiviral medication has no effect on aphthous stomatitis.|$|E
5000|$|Graffam {{was also}} a strong {{advocate}} of an independent Armenia where she and <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> would free the Armenians from [...] "Turkish domination." ...|$|R
50|$|The blunt {{nature of}} the cuts has been criticized, with some favoring more {{tailored}} cuts and <b>others</b> <b>arguing</b> for postponement while the economy improves.|$|R
50|$|Since 2007, the {{financial}} crisis of 2007-2010 and the ensuing global economic crisis has publicly exposed divisions within mainstream economics and significantly intensified controversy about its status, with some arguing for radical overhaul or rejection of mainstream economics, <b>others</b> <b>arguing</b> for evolutionary change, and <b>others</b> still <b>arguing</b> that mainstream economics explains the crisis.|$|R
5|$|Scholars also {{debate the}} exact {{influence}} of Jewish thought on Durkheim's work. The answer remains uncertain; {{some scholars have}} argued that Durkheim's thought {{is a form of}} secularized Jewish thought, while <b>others</b> <b>argue</b> that proving the existence of a direct influence of Jewish thought on Durkheim's achievements is difficult or impossible.|$|E
5|$|Some {{critics and}} historians argue that one {{characteristic}} of the Silver Age was that science fiction and aliens replaced magic and gods. <b>Others</b> <b>argue</b> that magic was {{an important element of}} both Golden Age and Silver Age characters. Many Golden Age writers and artists were science-fiction fans or professional science-fiction writers who incorporated SF elements into their comic-book stories. Science was a common explanation for the origin of heroes in the Silver Age.|$|E
5|$|Some {{put forth}} that this intermixing of species {{is against the}} teachings of the Talmud and thus against Jewish Law and nonkosher. <b>Others</b> <b>argue</b> that the one in sixty parts law of kashrut is of significance, and that the foreign gene {{accounts}} for the less than 1/60 of the animal and thus the modified salmon is kosher.|$|E
25|$|Free Software Foundation and <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> that no {{software}} {{should be}} patented unless it passes machine-or-transformation test, as this blocks both innovation and scientific collaboration.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s and 1970s Dr John X. W. P. Corcoran and <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> {{that the}} group in fact {{consisted}} of three contemporary types, and later excavations have supported this.|$|R
5000|$|Freud, among <b>others,</b> <b>argued</b> {{that neither}} {{predominantly}} different- nor same-sex sexuality were the norm, instead {{that what is}} called [...] "bisexuality" [...] is the normal human condition thwarted by society.|$|R
5|$|The {{degree to}} which the {{character}} of Alice can be identified as Alice Liddell is controversial. Some critics identify the character as Liddell, or write that she inspired the character. <b>Others</b> <b>argue</b> that Carroll considered his protagonist and Liddell to be separate. According to Carroll, his character was not based on any real child, but was entirely fictional.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent to}} which both Graffham and Fortitude North {{influenced}} German strategy in Scandinavia is disputed, with some historians arguing that very little of either deception reached the enemy. While <b>others</b> <b>argue</b> {{that the existence of}} fictional units in Scotland helped confirm German fears of a diversionary attack in the region.|$|E
5|$|There is {{continuing}} critical {{debate about the}} status of the poem as it is now available to us. While some scholars accept the texts of the Hymn as more or less accurate transmissions of Cædmon's original, <b>others</b> <b>argue</b> that they originated as a back-translation from Bede's Latin, and that there is no surviving witness to the original text.|$|E
25|$|Milton Friedman and <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> that a corporation's {{purpose is}} to {{maximize}} returns to its shareholders and that obeying {{the laws of the}} jurisdictions within which it operates constitutes socially responsible behavior.|$|R
40|$|During the Bush administration, as {{democracy}} assistance {{evolved from}} being a relatively uncontroversial U. S. policy with bipartisan support to a controversial policy associated with the neoconservative agenda, academics, journalists and others hastened to identify the political costs of doing democracy work. Critics of democracy assistance argued that encouraging elections too quickly in war torn countries could exacerbate ethnic tensions and ensure greater instability. <b>Others</b> <b>argued</b> that more democracy would bring anti-American leaders to power, particularly in Muslim countries, while still <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> that for poor unstable countries, stability, security and economic development should all be higher priorities than democracy...|$|R
2500|$|Alberto Gonzales and <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> that detainees {{should be}} {{considered}} [...] "unlawful combatants" [...] and as such not be protected by the Geneva Conventions in multiple memoranda regarding these perceived legal gray areas.|$|R
5|$|From 1911 to 1917, {{money was}} {{collected}} for interior furnishings, which were relatively sparse {{apart from the}} impressive main altar. (These original furnishings remained until the 1930s.) Parts of the draft plan were abandoned: the floor was not constructed from marble as intended, but poured from plain concrete; outside there were no pinnacles on the façade. Writings vary on when the pinnacles were built: some claim they were built in 1923, but <b>others</b> <b>argue</b> {{that they were not}} completed until the renovation of the cathedral in 1999. Observers that argue for an earlier construction date state that they were damaged during World WarII and left dismantled for some time.|$|E
5|$|Heavy cavalry was {{believed}} to have been developed by the Ancient Persians, although <b>others</b> <b>argue</b> for the Sarmatians. By the time of Darius (558486 BC), Persian military tactics required horses and riders that were completely armoured, and selectively bred a heavier, more muscled horse to carry the additional weight. The cataphract was a type of heavily armoured cavalry with distinct tactics, armour, and weaponry used {{from the time of the}} Persians up until the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>others</b> <b>argue</b> {{that the}} Sun is {{currently}} {{close to the}} galactic plane, and yet the last great extinction event was 15 million years ago. Therefore, the Sun's vertical position cannot alone explain such periodic extinctions, and that extinctions instead occur when the Sun passes through the galaxy's spiral arms. Spiral arms are home not only to larger numbers of molecular clouds, whose gravity may distort the Oort cloud, but also to higher concentrations of bright blue giants, which live for relatively short periods and then explode violently as supernovae.|$|E
2500|$|Coe and <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> that ferns were {{probably}} a major food source for herbivorous dinosaurs like ceratopsids {{and may have}} grown in vast [...] "prairies" [...] that could feed large numbers of dinosaurs.|$|R
5000|$|Alberto Gonzales and <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> that detainees {{should be}} {{considered}} [...] "unlawful combatants" [...] and as such not be protected by the Geneva Conventions in multiple memoranda regarding these perceived legal gray areas.|$|R
50|$|Some {{felt that}} such {{resilience}} was desirable {{in the face}} of random errors (e.g., line noise), while <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> that error correcting increased the scope for attackers to maliciously tamper with a message.|$|R
5|$|In 1545, from Southsea Castle, he {{witnessed}} his flagship Mary Rose sink {{with the loss}} of about 500 lives, whilst going into action against the French fleet in the Battle of the Solent. Some historians believe that the Mary Rose turned too quickly and submerged her open gun ports, whereas <b>others</b> <b>argue</b> that it sank due to its poor design. Over the years, Portsmouth's fortifications were rebuilt and improved by successive monarchs. In 1563, Portsmouth suffered from an outbreak of a plague, resulting in about 300 deaths out of the town's population of 2000.|$|E
5|$|<b>Others</b> <b>argue</b> {{that while}} the issues of {{increasing}} public costs are real, the importance of continued growth of OHSU for the city's economy must be factored in as well. Not only is it the largest employer in the city, but OHSU is an important and effective vehicle to attract both federal funding, totaling more than 168million dollars for 2005, and a highly skilled workforce to the area. The growth in the current campus on the Marquam Hill is limited by access roads and parking, an expansion of which would likely cause more dramatic harm to the surrounding communities.|$|E
5|$|These organisms {{appear to}} form two groups: the fractal rangeomorphs and the simpler erniettomorphs. Including such fossils as the iconic Charnia and Swartpuntia, {{the group is}} both the most iconic of the Ediacaran biota and the most {{difficult}} to place within the existing tree of life. Lacking any mouth, gut, reproductive organs, or indeed any evidence of internal anatomy, their lifestyle was somewhat peculiar by modern standards; the most widely accepted hypothesis holds that they sucked nutrients out of the surrounding seawater by osmotrophy or osmosis. However, <b>others</b> <b>argue</b> against this.|$|E
2500|$|Clark and <b>others</b> <b>argued</b> {{that it was}} {{impossible}} to know whether or not Velociraptor was a predator of Protoceratops based on the famous [...] "fighting dinosaurs" [...] specimen, since this was only one specimen.|$|R
50|$|Alternative {{currents}} {{in the mainstream}} and branches of heterodox economics argue differently, with some arguing that budget deficits are always harmful, and <b>others</b> <b>arguing</b> that budget deficits are not only beneficial, but also necessary.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} edition of the tournament eight {{participating}} teams were divided into two groups of four teams. Played against each <b>other,</b> <b>arguing</b> the winners for first place, while others allocate places to 8th.|$|R
