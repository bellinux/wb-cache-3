5|$|Fighting {{games are}} {{a type of}} action game where two {{on-screen}} characters fight each other. These games typically feature special moves that are triggered using rapid sequences <b>of</b> <b>carefully</b> timed button presses and joystick movements. Games traditionally show fighters from a side-view, even as the genre has progressed from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) graphics. Street Fighter II, though not the first fighting game, popularized and standardized the conventions of the genre, and similar games released prior to Street Fighter II have since been more explicitly classified as fighting games. Fighting games typically involve hand-to-hand combat, but may also feature melee weapons.|$|E
5|$|Doors and vents {{often had}} sills <b>of</b> <b>carefully</b> ground flat stone slabs and lintels {{constructed}} from {{a row of}} thin wood beams. Chacoan masons also frequently included intramural beams – horizontal logs completely enclosed in the wall core – which were probably intended to reduce horizontal deformation of the wall. The interior walls of great houses were typically covered in a rock veneer. Judd identified four distinct types, and his typology is the most commonly accepted in the region. Chetro Ketl's interior walls, particularly those in the eastern wing, were covered in a Type IV veneer characterized by uniform pieces of sandstone with little to no exposed mortar. Judd excluded a fifth type of masonry, called McElmo style, from his typology.|$|E

5|$|For Metal Gear Solid 4, Raiden's {{new design}} was a {{response}} to the criticism that only his face remained in his cybernetic body. Shinkawa, himself, was surprised by the way he came to illustrate Raiden. The staff noted that Raiden's debut in the Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer received notably positive responses; several video-game magazines promoted the game with Raiden's screenshots. Kojima echoed similar comments, indicating that he wanted to expand the character with another game. In designning him, Shinkawa wanted to convey both Raiden's beauty as well as sorrow in his cybernetic body. He was also made so that he could wield swords with his own legs giving the players the impressions he was a ninja. Raiden's first fight against Vamp in the game caused difficulty to motion and voice actors because <b>of</b> <b>carefully</b> planned movements performed by the two fighters. The staff was nevertheless satisfied with the outcome, considering it one of the best battles in the game. For the motion capture of Raiden, two actors were selected: one did most of his appearances while another did his action sequences.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} afterwards, his main {{literary}} output was his voluminous correspondence with his disciples. His letters, {{most of which}} were written in the 1930s, numbered in the several thousands. Many were brief comments made in the margins of his disciple's notebooks in answer to their questions and reports of their spiritual practice—others extended to several pages <b>of</b> <b>carefully</b> composed explanations of practical aspects of his teachings. These were later collected and published in book form in three volumes of Letters on Yoga. In the late 1930s, he resumed work on a poem he had started earlier—he continued to expand and revise this poem {{for the rest of his}} life. It became perhaps his greatest literary achievement, Savitri, an epic spiritual poem in blank verse of approximately 24,000 lines.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the rebels}} had been subdued, Abu Bakr began {{a war of}} conquest, {{beginning}} with Iraq. Sending his most brilliant general, Khalid ibn al-Walid, Iraq was conquered {{in a series of}} successful campaigns against the Sassanid Persians. Abu Bakr's confidence grew, and once Khalid established his stronghold in Iraq, Abu Bakr issued a call to arms for the invasion of Syria in February 634. The Muslim invasion of Syria was a series <b>of</b> <b>carefully</b> planned and well coordinated military operations that employed strategy instead of pure strength to deal with Byzantine defensive measures. The Muslim armies, however soon proved to be too small to handle the Byzantine response, and their commanders called for reinforcements. Khalid was sent by Abu Bakr from Iraq to Syria with reinforcements and to lead the invasion. In July 634, the Byzantines were decisively defeated at Ajnadayn. Damascus fell in September 634, followed by the Battle of Fahl where the last significant garrison of Palestine was defeated and routed.|$|E

5|$|There {{are around}} 31hill forts in Dorset; {{archaeologist}} Sharples, who undertook excavations at Maiden Castle, proposed that hill forts {{were used to}} control agricultural land to support a large community. Those in Dorset were situated near expanses of fertile land. Monumental defences such as the ditch at Maiden Castle indicate that the land was disputed and communities fought each other for control. This is supported by Cunliffe, who argues that the elaborate earthworks such as those around the entrances to Maiden Castle and Danebury were used to defend the weakest part of the hill fort. They increased the time the attackers took to reach the gateway, which would have left them vulnerable to defenders armed with slings. Hoards <b>of</b> <b>carefully</b> selected sling stones have been found at both sites.|$|E

The state – instead of absolving all responsibility (often thought of as occurring in a neoliberal economy) – is tied with the task <b>of</b> <b>carefully</b> controlling the market. Product price fixing, supermarket consolidation, labour control, and profit-channelling are all potential issues. Within the UK, the Competition Commission is charged with investigating regulatory powers vis-à-vis markets and company mergers, to prevent (or at least temper) such problems.|$|E

25|$|The door {{giving access}} to the minaret is framed by a lintel and jambs made of {{recycled}} carved friezes of antique origin. There are stone blocks from the Roman period that bear Latin inscriptions. Their use probably dates to the work done under the Umayyad governor Bishr ibn Safwan in about 725 AD, {{and they have been}} reused {{at the base of the}} tower. The greater part of the minaret dates from the time of the Aghlabid princes in the ninth century. It consists of regular layers <b>of</b> <b>carefully</b> cut rubble stone, thus giving the work a stylistically admirable homogeneity and unity.|$|E
25|$|The first {{aerospace}} {{materials were}} those long-established and often naturally occurring materials {{used to construct}} the first aircraft.

Standards were required for the selection, manufacture, and use of these materials. These standards were developed informally by manufacturers or government groups such as HM Balloon Factory, later to become RAE Farnborough, often {{with the assistance of}} university engineering departments.|$|E

25|$|Skeptics such as Paul Edwards have {{analyzed}} many {{of these}} accounts, and called them anecdotal, while also suggesting that claims of evidence for reincarnation originate from selective thinking and from the false memories that often result from one's own belief system and basic fears, and thus cannot be counted as empirical evidence. Carl Sagan referred to examples apparently from Stevenson's investigations in his book The Demon-Haunted World as an example <b>of</b> <b>carefully</b> collected empirical data, though he rejected reincarnation as a parsimonious explanation for the stories. Sam Harris cited Stevenson's works in his book The End of Faith {{as part of a}} body of data that seems to attest to the reality of psychic phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Planar {{magnetic}} speakers (having printed or embedded conductors {{on a flat}} diaphragm) {{are sometimes}} described as ribbons, but are not truly ribbon speakers. The term planar is generally reserved for speakers with roughly rectangular flat surfaces that radiate in a bipolar (i.e., front and back) manner. Planar magnetic speakers consist of a flexible membrane with a voice coil printed or mounted on it. The current flowing through the coil interacts with the magnetic field <b>of</b> <b>carefully</b> placed magnets {{on either side of}} the diaphragm, causing the membrane to vibrate more or less uniformly and without much bending or wrinkling. The driving force covers a large percentage of the membrane surface and reduces resonance problems inherent in coil-driven flat diaphragms.|$|E
25|$|It can {{be harmful}} to an animal {{for it to be}} over-milked past the point where the udder has stopped {{releasing}} milk. Consequently, the milking process involves not just applying the milker, but also monitoring the process to determine when the animal has been milked out and the milker should be removed. While parlor operations allowed a farmer to milk many more animals much more quickly, it also increased the number of animals to be monitored simultaneously by the farmer. The automatic take-off system was developed to remove the milker from the cow when the milk flow reaches a preset level, relieving the farmer of the duties <b>of</b> <b>carefully</b> watching over 20 or more animals being milked at the same time.|$|E
