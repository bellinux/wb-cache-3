5|$|Upon {{physical}} examination, {{breath sounds}} (heard with a stethoscope) may be diminished on the affected side, partly because {{air in the}} pleural space dampens the transmission of sound. Measures of the conduction of vocal vibrations to the surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> may be altered. Percussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> {{may be perceived as}} hyperresonant (like a booming drum), and vocal resonance and tactile fremitus can both be noticeably decreased. Importantly, the volume of the pneumothorax can show limited correlation with the intensity of the symptoms experienced by the victim, and physical signs may not be apparent if the pneumothorax is relatively small.|$|E
5|$|In COPD, it {{may take}} longer to breathe out than to breathe in. Chest {{tightness}} may occur but is not common and {{may be caused by}} another problem.

A barrel chest is a characteristic sign of COPD, but is relatively uncommon. Tripod positioning may occur as the disease worsens.|$|E

5|$|Medical procedures, {{such as the}} {{insertion}} of a central venous catheter into one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> veins or the taking of biopsy samples from lung tissue, may lead to pneumothorax. The administration of positive pressure ventilation, either mechanical ventilation or non-invasive ventilation, can result in barotrauma (pressure-related injury) leading to a pneumothorax.|$|E

Design of medical instruments can be modified to prevent iatrogenic TBI, and medical practitioners can use techniques that reduce the risk of injury with procedures such as tracheotomy.|$|E
5|$|Acne, {{also known}} as acne vulgaris, is a {{long-term}} skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin. It is characterized by blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, oily skin, and possible scarring. It primarily affects areas of the skin with a relatively high number of oil glands, including the face, upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest,</b> and back. The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> routine <b>chest</b> roentgenogram was {{studied in}} 284 patients, newly {{admitted}} to our paediatric outpatient department. Emergency patients {{were excluded from}} the study. In 141 cases the initial diagnosis after history, physical examination and ECG was "no heart disease", while in 143 cases it was "heart disease". After a follow up of up to 4 years, 170 children appeared to have "no heart disease" and 114 definite heart disease. In 7. 7 % <b>of</b> cases <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> roentgenogram made at the first visit to the outpatient department led to a change in policy, whereas in only 3. 8 % was <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> roentgenogram in someway helpful in establishing the correct diagnosis. Amongst those children with initial diagnosis <b>of</b> innocent murmur, <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> roentgenogram led to a diagnosis of "heart disease" in only 2. 8 % of cases. It is concluded that for the differentiation "heart disease" or "no heart disease", a chest X-ray film is not indicated. In children with "heart disease" <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> X-ray film is also of little value, and is mostly to be used only for documentation...|$|R

5|$|Paralytic {{shellfish}} poisoning (PSP) {{is primarily}} {{caused by the}} consumption of bivalves that have accumulated toxins by feeding on toxic dinoflagellates, single-celled protists found naturally in the sea and inland waters. Saxitoxin is the most virulent of these. In mild cases, PSP causes tingling, numbness, sickness and diarrhoea. In more severe cases, the muscles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> wall may be affected leading to paralysis and even death. In 1937, researchers in California established the connection between blooms of these phytoplankton and PSP. The biotoxin remains potent even when the shellfish are well-cooked. In the United States, there is a regulatory limit of 80µg/g of saxitoxin equivalent in shellfish meat.|$|E
5|$|Pleurodesis is a {{procedure}} that permanently eliminates the pleural space and attaches the lung to the chest wall. No long-term study (20 years or more) has been performed on its consequences. Good results {{in the short term}} are achieved with a thoracotomy (surgical opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest)</b> with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion (scraping of the pleura) of the inner layer. During the healing process, the lung adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the pleural space. Recurrence rates are approximately 1%. Post-thoracotomy pain is relatively common.|$|E

5|$|The {{likelihood}} of developing paralytic polio increases with age, {{as does the}} extent of paralysis. In children, nonparalytic meningitis {{is the most likely}} consequence of CNS involvement, and paralysis occurs in only one in 1000 cases. In adults, paralysis occurs in one in 75 cases. In children under five years of age, paralysis of one leg is most common; in adults, extensive paralysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> and abdomen also affecting all four limbs—quadriplegia—is more likely. Paralysis rates also vary depending on the serotype of the infecting poliovirus; the highest rates of paralysis (one in 200) are associated with poliovirus type 1, the lowest rates (one in 2,000) are associated with type 2.|$|E
5|$|The third {{mechanism}} {{occurs when}} the chest is compressed from front to back, causing it to widen from side to side. The lungs adhere to the chest wall because of the negative pressure {{between them and the}} pleural membranes lining the inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> cavity; thus when the chest widens, they are pulled apart. This creates tension at the carina; the airway tears if this tensile force exceeds its elasticity. This mechanism may be the cause of injury when the chest is crushed. Most TBI are probably due to a combination of these three mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Ultrasound is {{commonly}} used {{in the evaluation of}} people who have sustained physical trauma, for example with the FAST protocol. Ultrasound may be more sensitive than chest X-rays in the identification of pneumothorax after blunt trauma to the chest. Ultrasound may also provide a rapid diagnosis in other emergency situations, and allow the quantification {{of the size of the}} pneumothorax. Several particular features on ultrasonography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> can be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E

Conclusions. Basic pathophysiological mechanism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flail <b>chest</b> is respiratory distress, which is provoked by pulmonary contusions and paradoxical <b>chest</b> wall motion. <b>The</b> treatment should be pointed to improvement and support of respiratory functions and include aggressive pain control, pulmonary physiotherapy and selective mechanical ventilation. Views about operative fixation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flail <b>chest</b> are still controversial. Neither mortality rate neither long-term disability are improved after operative fixation. </p...|$|R
5|$|Blood tests may be {{performed}} to exclude other causes of muscle disease (elevated creatine kinase may indicate a myositis, and abnormal thyroid function tests may indicate thyrotoxic myopathy). Antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels {{can be identified}} in 85% of people with EMG-confirmed LEMS. Once LEMS is diagnosed, investigations such as a CT scan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> are usually performed to identify any possible underlying lung tumors. Around 50–60% of these are discovered immediately after the diagnosis of LEMS. The remainder is diagnosed later, but usually within two years and typically within four years. As a result, scans are typically repeated every six months {{for the first two}} years after diagnosis. While CT of the lungs is usually adequate, a positron emission tomography scan of the body may also {{be performed}} to search for an occult tumour, particularly of the lung.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air {{trapped in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present in up to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. Air is trapped in the chest cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity from the site of the tear. Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum, the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E
5|$|In early human {{embryonic}} life, {{a series of}} five branchial arches and four branchial pouches form {{that give rise to}} the human face, neck, and surrounding structures. The pouches are numbered such that the first pouch is the closest {{to the top of the}} embryo's head and the fourth is the furthest from it. The parathyroid glands originate from the interaction of the endoderm of the third and fourth pouch and neural crest mesenchyme. The position of the glands reverses during embryological life. The pair of glands which is ultimately inferior develops from the third pouch with the thymus, whereas the pair of glands which is ultimately superior develops from the fourth pouch. During embryological development, the thymus migrates downwards, dragging the inferior glands with it. The superior pair are not dragged downwards by the fourth pouch to the same degree. The glands are named after their final, not embryological, positions. Since the thymus's ultimate destination is in the mediastinum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest,</b> it is occasionally possible to have ectopic parathyroids derived from the third pouch within the chest cavity if they fail to detach in the neck.|$|E

50|$|During {{singing in}} the lower register, the larynx is lowered since the muscles which connect it to the rib cage are tensed whereas the muscles above the larynx are not tensed. Consequently, a large {{proportion}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vibratory energy is transmitted to the thoracic area, giving singers the impression that their voice is resonating in <b>the</b> <b>chest.</b> This impression however is false. <b>The</b> <b>chest</b> by virtue <b>of</b> its design and location can make no significant contribution to <b>the</b> resonance system <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voice. <b>The</b> <b>chest</b> is on <b>the</b> wrong side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vocal folds {{and there is nothing}} in <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lungs that could serve to reflect sound waves back toward the larynx.|$|R
25|$|The {{geographer}} Pausanias {{records that}} Athena placed the infant Erichthonius {{into a small}} chest (cista), which she entrusted to <b>the</b> care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three daughters <b>of</b> Cecrops: Herse, Pandrosos, and Aglauros of Athens. She warned the three sisters not to open <b>the</b> <b>chest,</b> but did not explain to them why or what was in it. Aglauros, and possibly one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other sisters, opened <b>the</b> <b>chest.</b> Differing reports say that they either found that the child itself was a serpent, that it was guarded by a serpent, that it was guarded by two serpents, or that it had <b>the</b> legs <b>of</b> a serpent. In Pausanias's story, the two sisters were driven mad by <b>the</b> sight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest's</b> contents and hurled themselves off the Acropolis, dying instantly, but an Attic vase painting shows them being chased by the serpent off <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cliff instead.
