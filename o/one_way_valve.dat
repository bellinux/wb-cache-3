5000|$|A chest {{drainage}} system is typically {{used to collect}} chest drainage (air, blood, effusions). Most commonly, {{drainage system}}s use three chambers {{which are based on}} the three-bottle system. The first chamber allows fluid that is drained from the chest to be collected. The second chamber functions as a [...] "water seal", which acts as a <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>valve</b> allowing gas to escape, but not reenter the chest. Air bubbling through the water seal chamber is usual when the patient coughs or exhales but may indicate, if continual, a pleural or system leak that should be evaluated critically. It can also indicate a leak of air from the lung. The third chamber is the suction control chamber. The height of the water in this chamber regulates the negative pressure applied to the system. A gentle bubbling through the water column minimizes evaporation of the fluid and indicates that the suction is being regulated to the height of the water column. In this way, increased wall suction does not increase the negative pressure of the system. Newer drainage systems eliminate the water seal using a mechanical check-valve, and some also use a mechanical regulator to regulate the suction pressure. Systems which employ both these are dubbed [...] "dry" [...] systems, whereas systems that retain the water seal but use a mechanical regulator are called [...] "wet-dry" [...] systems. Systems which use a water seal and water column regulator are called [...] "wet" [...] systems. Dry systems are advantageous as tip-overs of wet systems can spill and mix with blood, mandating the replacement of the system. Even newer systems are smaller and more ambulatory so the patient can be sent home for drainage if indicated.|$|E

As CO is excreted solely by the lung, a simple technique {{for measuring the}} end tidal {{carbon monoxide}} (ETCO) level was assessed as a method for screening for haemolytic disease in children. Methods: Two end expiratory breath samples were collected from normal children and from children with haemolytic disease using a <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>valve</b> connector between a mouth piece and an anaesthetic bag. The samples were analysed by gas chromatography for CO and carbon for dioxide (CO 2). The CO 2 value was used to normalise the CO value to an alveolar concentration. Carboxyhaemoglobin (HbCO) also was measured in the patient group for correlation analysis with ETCO. Results: A total of 21 children with β thalassaemia major, 15 children with other haemolytic diseases (hereditary spherocytosis n= 8, haemoglobin H disease n= 3 and thalassaemia intermedia n= 4) and 23 normal children were studied. The mean ETCO concentrations in the three groups were 3. 21 p. p. m., 7. 41 p. p. m. and 0. 69 p. p. m., respectively, which were significantly {{different from each other}} (P< 0. 0001). There was a significant correlation between ETCO and HbCO in the patient groups (r= 0. 85; P < 0. 0001). Conclusions: The end expiratory breath collection device is a simple and feasible sample collection method.

40|$|Abstract: Microfluidic systems require {{numerous}} {{control valves}} {{in order to}} function properly. These valves form the basic unit of fluid handling within the microfluidic system. Many different valves have been designed and manufactured, both active and passive. The current paper investigates a novel passive valve that works {{on the principle of}} hydrostatic pressure. This normally closed valve can also be used in a toggle valve combination, where only one external actuation source is required to yield two valves that open and close sequentially. The first valve is an active valve, operated pneumatically. The second valve operates purely on the pressure applied by the fluid in the microfluidic channel at the valve entrance. One valve is thus always closed, while the other is open. By changing the valve entrance properties, the valve can be designed to operate at different actuation pressures. The valve mechanism, which consists of four layers of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), was designed and manufactured using the SU- 8 lithography and replication molding processes. It was successfully implemented, and initial results show the relationship between the applied pressure and flow rate. In addition to being used as a toggle valve, this design also allows for the passive valve {{to be used as a}} stand-alone pressure valve and as a <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>valve,</b> which would restrict fluid flow to a single direction. This may give rise to the possibility of designing entirely passive microfluidic devices, which would be advantageous from a circuit complexity and energy usage perspective.

50|$|Hydraulic dashpots or hydraulic-action timers {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} and operation to pneumatic timers. Hydraulic-action timers work by energizing the solenoid coil which pulls the hollow core {{into the center of}} the coil. Fluid in the hollow core is then forced to go through an orifice at the top, a <b>one</b> <b>way</b> check <b>valve</b> at the bottom of the hollow core prevents the fluid from escaping through the bottom. After the fluid is expelled, the core completes its upward movement and closes an air gap in the core, which in turn increases its electromagnetic field strength. When the coil becomes de-energized, it releases the core, and fluid is forced back into the hollow area of the core through the check valve, so the fluid is used again next time the coil is energized. Hydraulic action timers are usually designed for a specific time, which is set in the factory during their manufacture. These timers are also very reliable.|$|R

The RA is the dominant arterial supply to the thenar musculature. We hypothesised that RA harvest should decrease O 2 saturation and thenar muscle power. Methods: RA was harvested from non-dominant (ND) limbs only (left n 58, right n 21). Oximeter values of O 2 saturation were taken from the thumb of the dominant (D) and non-dominant (ND) limb pre and post operatively.

Three {{measures of}} thenar ¯exor power (TFP) were taken and mean values obtained in the ND and D limbs. Results: O 2 saturation ranged from 92 to 98 % in the thumb of the ND limbs 24 h post RA harvest. The values for TFP (mean ^ SD) were 1246 ^ 246 mmHg (ND) and 1240 ^ 258 mmHg (D) pre-operatively and 1216 ^ 250 (ND) and 1259 ^ 233 (D) post operatively.

Limitations, conclusion and future directions. Glaucoma {{is the leading cause}} of irreversible blindness in the world and remains a devastating ophthalmic condition. Current management seems limited and focuses mainly on reducing intraocular pressure. Glaucoma research models such as cell and organ based culture, computer simulation and animal models have played major roles in advancing the field, however, disease progression still occurs indicative that the pathophysiology of glaucoma has not been fully elucidated. In an attempt to shed some light into this issue, a novel artificial hydraulic model has been developed to empirically simulate fluid dynamics of the human conventional outflow pathway. Using non-biological materials, this model comprised of critical elements of the human aqueous outflow tract that include a microsyringe pump (simulating aqueous inflow/outflow), 35 -gauge needle (stimulating trabecular meshwork), <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>valve</b> (simulating Schlemm’s canal inner wall endothelia) and a distal fluid column (simulating episcleral venous pressure) interconnected in between by pressure transducers and rigid tubings.

The blended fuels consist of 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 % coconut oil (COIL) (in volume basis) with diesel fuel (DF 2). Pure DF 2 was used for comparison purposes. The engine was operated at constant speed of 2000 rpm with 50 % throttle load {{for a period of}} 100 hours for each test fuel. The engine was operated for a total period of 600 hours for six fuels. The same lubricating oil equivalent to SAE 40 was used for all the fuels system. The sample of lube oil was collected through a <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>valve</b> connected to the crankcase sump at 50 hour intervals. The first sample was collected immediately after the engine had warmed up. The effect of blended fuel on engine component wear and lubrication characteristics in terms of viscosity, total base number (TBN), moisture content, oxidation, wear metals, contaminant elements and lubricant additive depletions were analyzed. The results showed that wear metals, contaminant elements increase with increasing COIL with DF 2. An increasing COIL in blends reduces additive elements; and the reduction rate during blends of up to 30 % COIL is quite similar to DF 2. Soot and sulfation reduce with increasing COIL in blended fuels due to reducing aromatics and sulfur in comparison to DF 2. The water concentration increases from above 30 % COIL blended fuels. The TBN and viscosity changes are found almost normal. The engine did not have any COIL blended fuels. These lubricating oil analysis data will help to select tribological components and compatible lubricating oil for coconut oil or biofuel operated diesel engines...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Limited {{research}} on delivered FIO 2 for oxygen delivery devices makes choosing {{the most effective}} device for our patients difficult. This is particularly true when caring for patients in high levels of respiratory distress. Hypothesis: When a patient’s level of distress increases, the actual FIO 2 differs from the following published estimates: 0. 28 - 0. 36 on 2 - 4 LPM via nasal cannula, 0. 40 - 0. 60 on 6 - 10 LPM via simple mask, 0. 60 - 0. 80 + on 12 - 15 LPM via nonrebreather mask, 0. 80 - 1. 0 on 30 - 50 LPM via high flow nasal cannula and 0. 24 - 0. 90 on 1 - 15 LPM via OxyMaskTM. [1] METHODS A 2010 Hans Rudolph, Inc. Series 1101 Breathing Simulator was attached to a mannequin using large bore tubing and <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>valves</b> in order to simulate inhalation and exhalation. A new sensor {{was placed in a}} Hudson RCI galvanic fuel cell oxygen analyzer, calibrated to room air and 100 % oxygen, and used to measure FIO 2 in the trachea. The oxygen delivery devices were connected via small bore tubing to an H/K tank using a Thorpe tube to measure oxygen flow. The baseline values were as follows: RAW 3 cmH 2 O/L/sec, CST 60 mL/cmH 2 O, respiratory rate 20 br/min, percent inhale 20 %, load effort SHORTIE, and effort slope of 20. The manipulated variables were oxygen flow rate and level of distress. The oxygen flow rates tested were between 2 and 50 LPM. The level of distress was represented by PIFR (peak inspiratory flow rate) which was established by increasing amplitude to result in PIFR of 40, 70 and 90 LPM. With each oxygen flow rate and level of distress, a measurement was taken after the FIO 2 had stabilized for 60 seconds. RESULTS At a PIFR of 40 LPM, all devices performed at or above FIO 2 expectations {{with the exception of the}} OxyMaskTM. At a PIFR of 40 LPM and oxygen flow rates of 10 LPM or greater, the OxyMaskTM performed below the published FIO 2.

Nine patients with obstructive lung disease took part in the study. The pattern of deposition associated with use of a metered dose inhaler alone was compared with that achieved with the spacer used both for inhalation of single puffs of aerosol and for inhalation of four puffs actuated in rapid succession and then inhaled simultane-ously. On each occasion there was a delay of 1 s between aerosol release and inhalation, simulat-ing poor inhaler technique. With the metered dose inhaler alone, a mean (SEM) 8 - 7 (1 - 8) % of the dose reached the lungs and 80 * 9 (1 9) % was deposited in the oropharynx. With single puffs from the spacer 20 - 9 (1. 6) % of the dose (p < 0. 01) reached the lungs, only 16 - 5 (2. 3) % (p < 0. 01) was deposited in the oropharynx, and 55 - 8 (3 1) % was retained within the spacer itself. With four puffs from the spacer 15 - 2 (1. 5) % reached the lungs (p = 0 - 02 compared with the metered dose inhaler alone, p < 0 - 01 compared with single puffs from the spacer), 11 - 4 (1. 2) % was deposited in the oropharynx, and 67 * 5 (1. 8) % in the device itself.

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare systemic absorption and bronchodilator effects of salbutamol given via a novel ("Ventstream") and a conventional ("Hudson Updraft II") nebuliser system, having initially evaluated the performance of both nebulisers in vitro. The "Ventstream" nebuliser uses a <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>valve</b> system to provide an additional inspiratory side flow to match aerosol delivery with tidal volume. METHODS [...] Nebuliser output and particle distribution from 10 Ventstream and 10 Hudson nebulisers were compared in vitro. Eight asthmatic patients, FEV 1 55 (2) % predicted, were then randomised to receive salbutamol via Ventstream or Hudson nebulisers on separate days. On each day cumulative doses of inhaled salbutamol were given: 1. 25 mg, 2. 5 mg (1. 25 + 1. 25 mg), and 5. 0 mg (2. 5 + 2. 5 mg). Airways responses, systemic responses, and plasma salbutamol concentrations were measured at each dose and for up to 240 minutes after the final dose. RESULTS [...] The in vitro comparison showed a greater respirable fraction with a higher percentage volume of particles < 5 microns in diameter using Ventstream than Hudson nebulisers (mean (95 % CI) for difference) : 25. 4 % (95 % CI 22. 4 % to 28. 3 %), and a higher aerosol rate of output: 0. 08 g/min (95 % CI 0. 05 to 0. 11 g/min). At the 5. 0 mg dose the Ventstream produced a twofold greater concentration of plasma salbutamol than the Hudson nebuliser (AUC 0 - 240) : 392. 1 ng/ml. min (95 % CI 240. 6 to 543. 6 ng/ml. min). There was a higher AUC 0 - 240 for PEFR with the Ventstream than with the Hudson nebuliser: 74. 161 x 10 (2) (95 % CI 39. 50 to 108. 821 x 10 (2). For FEV 1 and FEV 25 - 75 there was a difference in the peak response between the 5. 0 mg and 2. 5 mg doses with the Ventstream only. Extrapulmonary beta 2 responses were greater with the Ventstream than with the Hudson at 2. 5 mg and 5. 0 mg doses, although the differences did not appear to be clinically relevant. CONCLUSIONS [...] The Ventstream produced a twofold increase in the delivery of salbutamol to the lung compared with the Hudson nebuliser, and there was an associated increase in systemic beta 2 responses with an improvement in some parameters of bronchodilator efficacy. As a consequence of improved delivery with the Ventstream, it may be possible to halve the drug dose to produce similar bronchodilator efficacy at reduced cost. Further studies are required to evaluate the value of the Ventstream for delivery of nebulised antibiotics and corticosteroids...|$|E
40|$|Respiratory drug {{delivery}} {{has been under}} the research spotlight {{for the past few}} decades, mainly due to the high incidence of pulmonary diseases and the fact that this type of delivery offers the highest efficiency for treatment. Despite its invaluable benefits, there are some major drawbacks to respiratory {{drug delivery}}- the most important of which being poor delivery efficiency and relatively high drug deposition in undesirable regions, such as the oral cavity. This study focused on improving inhalation therapy devices function using the results and findings obtained from CFD simulations. Particle transport and deposition in an idealized oral airway geometry to better optimize the spacer one way-valve shape and design was studied {{in the second part of}} this research. A key issue in pulmonary drug delivery is improving the medical delivery device for effective and targeted treatment. Spacers are clear plastic containers attached to inhalers aimed at delivering more drug particles to the respiratory tract. The spacer&rsquo;s one way-valve plays an important role in controlling and initializing the particles into the oral cavity. Three steady flow rates were used 15, 30 and 60 l/min and a Lagrangian, one-way coupled particle tracking model with near wall turbulence fluctuation correction was used to determine the deposition rates. For all three breathing rates, the velocity field in the mid-sagittal plane showed similar gross fluid dynamics characteristics, such as the separation and recirculation regions that occur after the larynx. The particle deposition rates compared reasonably well with available experiments. Most particles deposited at the larynx, where the airway has a decreasing cross-sectional area. For different particles sizes, most particles introduced at the lower region of the mouth produces higher possibility to pass through upper airway and enter the trachea and lung airways. The particle deposition patterns in the airway were traced back to its initial inlet position at the oral inlet; and this information provides the background for a conceptual and optimized design of the spacer <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>valve.</b> Pressurized-metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) are the most popular aerosol therapy device for treating lung diseases. Despite its popularity, they are inefficient in delivering drug particles to the lung. Improving its performance involves ongoing investigations in the fields of engineering and medical science. In the last part of this research, the effect of two spray characteristics (injection velocity and spray cone angle) on the drug delivery efficiency was discussed. An idealized oral airway geometry, extending from mouth to the main bronchus, was connected to a pMDI device. Inhalation flow rates of 15, 30 and 60 l/min were used and the drug particle tracking was a one-way coupled Lagrangian model. The results showed that most particles deposited in the pharynx, where the airway has a reduced cross-sectional area. Particle deposition generally decreased with initial spray velocity, and with increased spray cone angle for 30 l/min and 60 l/min flow rates. However for 15 l/min flow rate the deposition increased slightly with an increase in the spray velocity and cone angle. The effect of spray cone angle was greater than the injection velocity on particle deposition. Overall drug delivery to the lungs was best achieved for 30 l/min, which produced on average 5 % increase in pulmonary delivery compared to inhalation rates of 15 and 60 l/min. Conventional inhalation therapy devices such as inhalers and nebulizers, nevertheless, suffer from low delivery efficiencies wherein only a small fraction of the inhaled drug reaches the lower respiratory tract. This is primarily because these devices are not able to produce a sufficiently fine drug mist that has aerodynamic diameters on the order of a few microns. The last part of this study employs using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to investigate the transport and deposition of the drug particles produced by a new aerosolization technique driven by surface acoustic waves (SAWs) into an in silico lung model geometrically reconstructed using computed tomography (CT) scanning. The particles generated by the SAW are released in different locations in a spacer chamber attached to a lung model extending from the mouth to the 6 th generation of the lung bronchial tree. An Eulerian approach is used to solve the Navier-Stokes equations that govern the airflow within the respiratory tract and a Lagrangian approach is adopted to track the particles, which are assumed to be spherical and inert. Due to the complexity of the lung geometry, the airflow patterns vary as it penetrates deeper into the lung. In particular, we find that larger particles above 10 &micro;m are unable to follow the airflow stream immediately after a sharp change in the geometry. As such, these particles tend to deposit at locations where the geometry experiences a significant reduction in cross-section. The findings, nevertheless, show that the injection location can influence the delivery efficiency: injection points close to the spacer centerline result in deeper penetration into the lung. Additionally, we found that the ratio of drug particles entering the right lung is significantly higher than the left lung independent of the injection location...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect on}} aerosol {{deposition}} from a pressurised {{metered dose inhaler}} of a 750 cm 3 spacer device with a <b>one</b> <b>way</b> inhalation <b>valve</b> (Nebuhaler, Astra Pharmaceuticals) was assessed {{by means of an}} in vivo radiotracer technique. Nine patients with obstructive lung disease took part in the study. The pattern of deposition associated with use of a metered dose inhaler alone was compared with that achieved with the spacer used both for inhalation of single puffs of aerosol and for inhalation of four puffs actuated in rapid succession and then inhaled simultaneously. On each occasion there was a delay of 1 s between aerosol release and inhalation, simulating poor inhaler technique. With the metered dose inhaler alone, a mean (SEM) 8. 7 (1. 8) % of the dose reached the lungs and 80. 9 (1. 9) % was deposited in the oropharynx. With single puffs from the spacer 20. 9 (1. 6) % of the dose (p less than 0. 01) reached the lungs, only 16. 5 (2. 3) % (p less than 0. 01) was deposited in the oropharynx, and 55. 8 (3. 1) % was retained within the spacer itself. With four puffs from the spacer 15. 2 (1. 5) % reached the lungs (p = 0. 02 compared with the metered dose inhaler alone, p less than 0. 01 compared with single puffs from the spacer), 11. 4 (1. 2) % was deposited in the oropharynx, and 67. 5 (1. 8) % in the device itself. It is concluded that the spacer device gives lung deposition of metered dose aerosols comparable to or greater than a correctly used inhaler and oropharyngeal deposition is greatly reduced. The spacer should be used preferably for the inhalation of single puffs of aerosol but may also be used for the inhalation of up to four puffs actuated in rapid succession and then inhaled simultaneously...|$|R
