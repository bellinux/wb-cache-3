5|$|Called {{by nearly}} a dozen {{different}} names and with varying words, melodies and purpose but common themes, the song's history reflects many of the evolutionary changes and cross-currents of American music. It begins early in the 19th century with a backwoods preacher who wrote hymns, persists through that century, manifests itself in a 1930s gospel blues recording done in a prison by a blind inmate convicted <b>of</b> <b>murder,</b> <b>and</b> sees use in the 1950s as a folk song, before attaining its realization by Jefferson Airplane.

5|$|The Cerro Maravilla murders, {{also known}} as the Cerro Maravilla massacre, is the name given by the Puerto Rican public and media to {{describe}} the events that occurred on July 25, 1978, at Cerro Maravilla, a mountain in Puerto Rico, wherein two young Puerto Rican pro-independence activists were murdered in a Puerto Rico Police ambush.

5|$|The {{proximate}} {{cause of the}} conflict was {{the death of a}} Praying Indian named John Sassamon in 1675. Sassamon had been an advisor and friend to King Philip; however, Sassamon's conversion to Christianity had driven the two apart. Accused in the murder of Sassamon were some of Philip's most senior lieutenants. A jury of twelve Englishmen and six Praying Indians found the Native Americans guilty <b>of</b> <b>murder</b> <b>and</b> sentenced them to death. To this day, some debate exists whether King Philip's men actually committed the murder.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the best}} efforts of his father to secure a {{favorable}} venue, judge, and defense team, on January 31, 1825, the jury convicted Isaac Desha <b>of</b> <b>murder</b> <b>and</b> sentenced him to hang. Rowan immediately requested a new trial upon grounds of jury interference, and Shannon granted the request on February 10. Jury selection proved problematic, occupying at least parts of four terms of the Harrison County Circuit Court. In September 1825, a jury was finally empaneled. The judge, Harry O. Brown, had been temporarily appointed to his position by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. Desha was again found guilty, and sentenced to hang on July 14, 1826. Judge Brown overturned the verdict because the prosecution had not proven that the murder took place in Fleming County, as alleged in the indictment against Desha. The state argued that this was of no consequence, since a change of venue had already been granted, but the judge's ruling stood, and Governor Desha's reputation took a further hit.|$|E
