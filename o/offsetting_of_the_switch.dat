This paper seeks to examine <b>the</b> viability <b>of</b> CNG and its potential to power Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government’s fleet of waste removal trucks. This paper takes into account financial and environmental factors in determining CNG’s potential, but gives priority to financial considerations. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> this analysis are mixed—under some future scenarios, compressed natural gas would be a favorable option for the fleet, but given other future scenarios, CNG would not be viable. In terms of environmental benefits, a switch to CNG would represent at most a 0. 08 % reduction in greenhouse gases, but would net other social benefits such as increased visibility and lower cancer rates. This analysis takes into account six different scenarios using two different variables. The scenarios are built using three different prices for diesel fuel: high prices, low prices, and the USA Energy Information Association’s point estimate for the price diesel fuel, coupled with two different assumptions about <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> compressed natural gas trucks compared to <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> diesel trucks. Under <b>the</b> high price <b>of</b> diesel scenarios, {{there is a possibility}} that savings associated with adoption of compressed natural gas to fuel Lexington refuse vehicles could fully <b>offset</b> costs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> within a 10 -year payback period. Under all other scenarios, the estimated savings would not fully offset costs within that payback period. Kahne |...|$|R

Linearity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ADC is improved by simultaneously adjusting <b>the</b> digital gain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stages and <b>the</b> coefficients <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polynomials inverse function, using presented scheme. Output codes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stages are applied to digital unit for calibration. Errors include capacitors mismatch, finite and nonlinear gain of Operational Amplifier (opamp), <b>offset</b> <b>of</b> opamp, and <b>offset</b> <b>of</b> sampling <b>switches.</b> <b>The</b> used algorithm is digital, completely. Trade-off between the speed and <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pipelined ADC is improved by this technique, extensively. In the proposed technique, design problems of analogue circuits are moved inside digital circuit. The technique is simulated on a prototype 10 bit 1. 5 bit/stage pipelined ADC with nonlinear opamp by using MATLAB/Simulink. After the proposed calibration, the ADC achieves 64. 5 dB SNDR and 73 dB SFDR which are restricted to 51. 2 dB and 57 dB respectively before calibration.

40|$|AbstractThe time {{dimension}} is always embedded in any human experience {{and is an}} inseparable part of it. According to scalar timing theory, timing behavior is based on <b>the</b> output <b>of</b> an internal clock that provides long-term memory representations that can be retrieved and compared with <b>the</b> representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current temporal interval held in short-term memory. More precisely, the model includes a pacemaker, a switch, and an accumulator. At <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> a timed stimulus, <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> closes, thereby allowing pulses emitted by the pacemaker to enter the accumulator. At <b>the</b> <b>offset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stimulus, <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> opens and pulse transfer terminates. Thus, representation of stimulus duration depends on <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> pulses accumulated during the stimulus presentation. According to the model, a temporal judgment results from a comparison, via <b>the</b> decision mechanism, <b>of</b> this representation of stimulus duration with longer-term representations of biologically significant durations experienced previously. However, the relevance and importance of time is not constant but varies depending on the meaning assigned to a certain situation. The present study investigated how symbolic meaning affectes time perception in school children and adults. In particular, we investigated how children experience time and how the environment acts on children subjective experience of time. Stimuli with different symbolic meaning are be employed (<b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> fastness or slowness). In the present study we employed two stimuli, one that recalls <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> fastness (motorbike) and one that recalls <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> slowness (bicycle). We predicted that observing a stimulus that recall <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> speed affect participant's performance {{in the way that}} stimuli that recall <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> fastness will be under-reproduced and stimuli that recall <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> slowness will be over- reproduced. Two experiments are presented. Experiment 1 included two hundred participants divided in 9 different groups according to their school class: 5 groups belonged to primary school, 3 groups were middle school, and 1 group was of university students. Participants were engaged in a time reproduction task in which a motorbike or a bicycle were presented for 11, 21, and 36 s. After <b>the</b> presentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> standard duration, participants were required to press the space bar to reproduce the duration previously presented. Significant differences between groups were found. Younger participants under-reproduced the duration more than did older participants. Importantly, an effect of symbolic meaning was found in youngre participants (up to 8 years old) older participants did not present any effect of symbolic meaning. We reasoned that the time reproduction task might not be the appropriate method to investigate time perception in older participants in particular when longer durations are employed. Experiment 2 included twenty university students. The visual stimuli were four pictures representing a bicycle and a motorbike and a bicycle and a motorbike driven by a person. Participants were engaged in a time bisection task: standard short 400 ms and the standard long was 1600 ms. Each standard duration was presented 10 times. After the training phase participants were required to perform 4 blocks. In each block, the four pictures were presented 7 times for each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> comparison durations (400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600 ms; total 196 trials in each block). The participants were asked to respond with their left and right index finger and response keys were counterbalanced between participants. The cumulative normal function was fitted to the resulting curves. We calculated the temporal bisection point as index <b>of</b> perceived duration; <b>the</b> observed shift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bisection point for the different vehicles presented can be interrelated as an indicator of differences in perceiving duration. Thus, longer perceived durations are reflected by smaller bisection points values. Results confirmed and extended previous findings observed with younger participants. When the stimulus presented recalled <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> fastness, temporal intervals were under- estimated, whereas, when the stimulus presented recalled <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> slowness, temporal intervals were over-estimated. The present study also pointed out <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> selecting <b>the</b> appropriate method to investigate time perception...|$|R

The maximum likelihood estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clock <b>offset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> listening node hearing the broadcasts from both the master and slave nodes was derived in [1] assuming symmetric exponential link delays. This paper advances those results in two directions. First, some improved estimators, each being optimal in its own class, are derived for <b>the</b> clock <b>offset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> listening node and mean link delays. Second, the results are generalized by addressing the more realistic problem <b>of</b> clock <b>offset</b> estimation under asymmetric exponential delays.
