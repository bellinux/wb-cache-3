40|$|In {{this short}} paper a {{recurrent}} neural network, that behaves as the double scroll, is stabilized {{and controlled by}} means of linear dynamic feedback. The controller design is based upon stability criteria for neural control systems and involves the solution of a nonlinear optimization problem. Keywords. Controlling chaos, recurrent neural networks, neural state space models, neural control, global asymptotic stability, I/O stability with finite L 2 -gain. 1 Introduction In recent years several approaches were taken {{in order to control}} chaotic systems, such as parameter variation techniques, the <b>oscillation</b> <b>absorber</b> concept, control theoretical approaches or control via impulses (see e. g. [?, ?, ?, ?]). Many of these methods are investigated with respect to Chua's circuit. Here we present results on controlling a recurrent neural network emulator for Chua's double scroll. The controller design is based on global asymptotic and I/O stability criteria for neural control systems. The probl [...] ...|$|E
50|$|In a vehicle, shock {{absorbers}} reduce {{the effect of}} traveling over rough ground, leading to improved ride quality and vehicle handling. While {{shock absorbers}} serve the purpose of limiting excessive suspension movement, their intended sole purpose is to damp spring <b>oscillations.</b> Shock <b>absorbers</b> use valving of oil and gasses to absorb excess energy from the springs. Spring rates are chosen by the manufacturer based on {{the weight of the}} vehicle, loaded and unloaded. Some people use shocks to modify spring rates {{but this is not the}} correct use. Along with hysteresis in the tire itself, they damp the energy stored in the motion of the unsprung weight up and down. Effective wheel bounce damping may require tuning shocks to an optimal resistance.|$|R
40|$|Due to the frequency–energy {{dependence}} of nonlinear <b>oscillations,</b> nonlinear dynamical <b>absorbers</b> present interesting properties for mitigating unwanted vibrations in mechanical systems. Unlike the tuned mass damper, the functional {{form of a}} nonlinear absorber is not known a priori and must be determined. This short note addresses this issue when a light-weight nonlinear absorber {{is attached to a}} nonlinear primary structure. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the determination of an adequate functional form may be directly linked to the frequency–energy {{dependence of}} the primary structure. Peer reviewe...|$|R
30|$|Later on, leaf-sprung bogies are {{introduced}} in the tank suspension design [3, 4]. The system is made {{of a pair of}} wheels carried on leaf sprigs or leaf-sprung arms. When one wheel is raised like by contacting terrain, the other is lowered to keep uniform track pressure, which is rather light, maintenance-friendly, has decent travel length and keeps the tracks from slipping. Since the friction of the leaves sliding over each other dampens <b>oscillation,</b> no shock <b>absorbers</b> are needed. This cheap and effective system was quickly adopted widely and modified into various forms [3, 4].|$|R
40|$|A {{bistable}} nonlinear {{energy sink}} conceived {{to mitigate the}} vibrations of host structural systems is considered in this paper. The hosting structure consists of two coupled symmetric linear oscillators (LOs), and the nonlinear energy sink (NES) is connected to one of them. The peculiar nonlinear dynamics of the resulting three-degree-of-freedom system is analytically described by means of its slow invariant manifold derived from a suitable rescaling, coupled with a harmonic balance procedure, applied to the governing equations transformed in modal coordinates. On {{the basis of the}} first-order reduced model, the absorber is tuned and optimized to mitigate both modes for a broad range of impulsive load magnitudes applied to the LOs. On the one hand, for low-amplitude, in-well, oscillations, the parameters governing the bistable NES are tuned {{in order to make it}} functioning as a linear tuned mass damper (TMD); on the other, for high-amplitude, cross-well, <b>oscillations,</b> the <b>absorber</b> is optimized on the basis of the invariant manifolds features. The analytically predicted performance of the resulting tuned bistable nonlinear energy sink (TBNES) is numerically validated in terms of dissipation time; the absorption capabilities are eventually compared with either aTMD and a purely cubic NES. It is shown that, for a wide range of impulse amplitudes, the TBNES allows the most efficient absorption even for the detuned mode, where a single TMD cannot be effective...|$|R
