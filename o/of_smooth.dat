5|$|Liver {{cells are}} {{another example of}} {{specialized}} cells that contain an abundance <b>of</b> <b>smooth</b> ER. These cells provide {{an example of the}} role <b>of</b> <b>smooth</b> ER in carbohydrate metabolism. Liver cells store carbohydrates in the form of glycogen. The breakdown of glycogen eventually leads to the release of glucose from the liver cells, which is important in the regulation of sugar concentration in the blood. However, the primary product of glycogen breakdown is glucose-1-phosphate. This is converted to glucose-6-phosphate and then an enzyme of the liver cell's smooth ER removes the phosphate from the glucose, so that it can then leave the cell.|$|E
5|$|The stable {{homotopy}} {{groups of}} spheres {{are important in}} singularity theory, which studies the structure of singular points <b>of</b> <b>smooth</b> maps or algebraic varieties. Such singularities arise as critical points <b>of</b> <b>smooth</b> maps from Rm to Rn. The geometry near a critical point of such a map can be described by an element of πmminus&1(S'nminus&1), by considering {{the way in which}} a small m minus& 1 sphere around the critical point maps into a topological n minus& 1 sphere around the critical value.|$|E
5|$|Gould's most {{significant}} contribution to evolutionary biology was the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which he developed with Niles Eldredge in 1972. The theory proposes that most evolution is characterized by long periods of evolutionary stability, which is infrequently punctuated by swift periods of branching evolution. The theory was contrasted against phyletic gradualism, the popular idea that evolutionary change {{is marked by a}} pattern <b>of</b> <b>smooth</b> and continuous change in the fossil record.|$|E
40|$|Multi-voxel pattern {{analyses}} (MVPA) {{are often}} performed on unsmoothed data, {{which is very}} different from the general practice <b>of</b> large <b>smoothing</b> extents in standard voxel-based analyses. In this report, we studied the effect <b>of</b> <b>smoothing</b> on MVPA results in a motor paradigm. Subjects pressed four buttons with two different fingers of the two hands in response to auditory commands. Overall, independent of the degree <b>of</b> <b>smoothing,</b> correlational MVPA showed distinctive patterns for the different hands in all studied regions of interest (motor cortex, prefrontal cortex, and auditory cortices). With regard to the effect <b>of</b> <b>smoothing,</b> our findings suggest that results from correlational MVPA show a minor sensitivity to <b>smoothing.</b> Moderate amounts <b>of</b> <b>smoothing</b> (in this case, 1 − 4 times the voxel size) improved MVPA correlations, from a slight improvement to large improvements depending on the region involved. None of the regions showed signs of a detrimental effect of moderate levels <b>of</b> <b>smoothing.</b> Even higher amounts <b>of</b> <b>smoothing</b> sometimes had a positive effect, most clearly in low-level auditory cortex. We conclude that smoothing seems to have a minor positive effect on MVPA results, thus researchers should be mindful about the choices they make regarding the level <b>of</b> <b>smoothing...</b>|$|R

5|$|Muscle {{cells have}} another {{specialized}} function <b>of</b> <b>smooth</b> ER. The ER membrane pumps calcium ions from the cytosol into the cisternal space.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} degrees <b>of</b> <b>smoothing</b> {{on the results}} of equipercentile equating in the random groups design using a postsmoothing method based on cubic splines were investigated. A computer-based procedure was introduced for selecting a desirable degree <b>of</b> <b>smoothing.</b> The procedure was based on two criteria: (1) that the equating function is reasonably smooth, as evaluated by the second derivatives of the cubic spline functions, and (2) that the equated score distributions are close to that of the old form. The equating functions obtained from smoothing the equipercentile equivalents by a fixed smoothing degree and a degree selected by the computer-based procedure were evaluated in computer simulations for four tests. The results suggest that no particular fixed degree <b>of</b> <b>smoothing</b> always led to an optimal degree <b>of</b> <b>smoothing.</b> The degrees <b>of</b> <b>smoothing</b> selected by the computer-based procedure were better than the best fixed degrees <b>of</b> <b>smoothing</b> for two <b>of</b> the four tests studied; for one of the other two tests, the degrees selected by the computer procedure performed better or nearly as well as the best fixed degrees.

40|$|Various {{combinations}} <b>of</b> <b>smoothing</b> parameters {{within a}} two-pass Barnes objective analysis scheme {{are applied to}} analytic observations obtained by regular and irregular sampling of a one-dimensional sinusoidal analytic wave to obtain gridded fields. Each of these various combinations <b>of</b> <b>smoothing</b> parameters would produce equivalent analyses if the observations were continuous and infinite (unbounded). The authors demonstrate that owing to the discreteness of the analytic observations, the actual analyses resulting from these various combinations <b>of</b> <b>smoothing</b> parameters are different. When derivatives are computed and as stations become more irregularly distributed, these differences increase. An awareness of these potentially significant analysis differences should prompt the analyst to consider carefully the choice <b>of</b> <b>smoothing</b> parameters when applying an objective analysis scheme to real observations. 1...|$|R
30|$|Here, {{we discuss}} a {{theoretical}} property of SEMD, namely, the variation diminishing property of envelopes. It implies that, as the value <b>of</b> <b>smoothing</b> parameter increases, variation of envelopes decreases monotonically. In other words, structures of envelopes such as {{peaks and valleys}} disappear monotonically as the level <b>of</b> <b>smoothing</b> increases. Thus, lower and upper envelopes generated by a certain level <b>of</b> <b>smoothing</b> parameter should not contain some artifacts due to noise. This fact has been known as causality in the scale space literature (see, e.g.,[14]).|$|R
5|$|Two regions <b>of</b> <b>smooth</b> plains were {{observed}} by Voyager 2. They generally have low relief and have far fewer craters {{than in the}} cratered terrains, indicating a relatively young surface age. In one of the smooth plain regions, Sarandib Planitia, no impact craters were visible down to the limit of resolution. Another region <b>of</b> <b>smooth</b> plains to the southwest of Sarandib is criss-crossed by several troughs and scarps. Cassini has since viewed these smooth plains regions, like Sarandib Planitia and Diyar Planitia at much higher resolution. Cassini images show these regions filled with low-relief ridges and fractures, probably caused by shear deformation. The high-resolution images of Sarandib Planitia revealed {{a number of small}} impact craters, which allow for an estimate of the surface age, either 170 million years or 3.7 billion years, depending on assumed impactor population.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the lower}} {{respiratory}} tract including the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles is lined with respiratory epithelium. This is a ciliated epithelium interspersed with goblet cells which produce mucus, and club cells with actions similar to macrophages. Incomplete rings of cartilage in the trachea and smaller plates of cartilage in the bronchi, keep these airways open. Bronchioles are too narrow to support cartilage and their walls are <b>of</b> <b>smooth</b> muscle, and this is largely absent in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium. The respiratory tract ends in lobules. Each lobule consists of a respiratory bronchiole, which branches into alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs, which in turn divide into alveoli.|$|E
5|$|Mycena mustea {{is similar}} to the North American species M.umbrinovinosa, which is {{distinguished}} by having a vinaceous-brown to purplish-black cap, irregularly shaped cheilocystidia that are covered at their tips with long, flexuous excrescences, and clamp connections. Mycena mustea is also similar to the European species M.urania, which differs in its blackish-violet cap, broadly club-shaped cheilocystidia covered with numerous, evenly spaced warts, and clamp connections. Mycena mustea also resembles the Japanese M.fonticola, a species described concurrently with M.mustea. Unlike that of M.fonticola, the cap of M.mustea typically becomes pale grayish-purple when mature; the cheilocystidia have several short finger-like excrescences at their tips; and the stem cuticle is made up <b>of</b> <b>smooth</b> hyphae. In contrast, the cap of M.fonticola becomes dark violet-brown when mature; there are no excrescences on the cheilocystidia; and the hyphae of the stem cuticle are sparsely covered with diverticulae that resemble warts or fingers.|$|E

5|$|The {{expanded}} surface coverage {{provided by}} Cassini has {{allowed for the}} identification of additional regions <b>of</b> <b>smooth</b> plains, particularly on Enceladus's leading hemisphere (the side of Enceladus that faces the direction of motion as it orbits Saturn). Rather than being covered in low-relief ridges, this region is covered in numerous criss-crossing sets of troughs and ridges, similar to the deformation seen in the south polar region. This area is {{on the opposite side}} of Enceladus from Sarandib and Diyar Planitiae, suggesting that the placement of these regions is influenced by Saturn's tides on Enceladus.|$|E
5|$|The geology of Titania was {{influenced}} by two competing forces: impact crater formation and endogenic resurfacing. The former acted over the moon's entire history and influenced all surfaces. The latter processes were also global in nature, but active mainly for a period following the moon's formation. They obliterated the original heavily cratered terrain, explaining the relatively low number of impact craters on the moon's present-day surface. Additional episodes of resurfacing may have occurred later {{and led to the}} formation <b>of</b> <b>smooth</b> plains. Alternatively smooth plains may be ejecta blankets of the nearby impact craters. The most recent endogenous processes were mainly tectonic in nature and caused the formation of the canyons, which are actually giant cracks in the ice crust. The cracking of the crust was caused by the global expansion of Titania by about 0.7%.|$|E

There is evidence that the control <b>of</b> <b>smooth</b> muscle cell differentiation by MiR-1 may be mediated by the down regulation of Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), since a MiR-1 recognition site is predicted in the 3' UTR of KLF4 and inhibition of MiR-1 results in reversed down-regulation of KLF4 and an inhibition <b>of</b> <b>smooth</b> muscle cell differentiation.
