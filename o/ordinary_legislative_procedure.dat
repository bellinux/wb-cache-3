Usually where it operates unanimously, it only needs to consult the Parliament. However, in most areas the <b>ordinary</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>procedure</b> applies meaning both Council and Parliament share legislative and budgetary powers equally, meaning both have to agree for a proposal to pass.

5|$|However, Graham {{suggests}} that Lord Steyn's comments {{were limited to}} the use of the Parliament Acts and would not apply to legislation enacted using the <b>ordinary</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>procedure.</b> He also argues that it would be difficult to explain how courts would refuse to apply legislation unless human rights were involved, citing the example of the removal of judicial review: using fundamental common law principles to interpret legislation is very different from striking down legislation supported by the elected House of Commons, and would be even more contentious if the legislation only substantially modified judicial review procedure.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament {{gained more}} powers from {{successive}} treaties, namely through {{the extension of}} the <b>ordinary</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>procedure</b> (then called the codecision procedure), and in 1999, the Parliament forced the resignation of the Santer Commission.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to discussions surrounding interest group {{representation in the}} European Parliament (EP). Different types of procedures effect committees’ demands for legitimacy, impacting the balance of private and public interests. We inspect a population of 10, 000 accredited lobbyists, and the entire procedural output across the 7 th legislature’s (2009 - 2014) committees. The results indicate that committees with a higher ratio of <b>Ordinary</b> <b>Legislative</b> <b>Procedures</b> to Own Initiative Reports see greater numbers of private interests involved. However, in committees where the procedures’ ratios are inverse we observe greater numbers of public interests involved. While this may overturn the premise of business dominance across the Institution. It has implications regarding the balanced representation {{of public and private}} interests on a procedural level. The paper offers a novel approach for framing the nature of the committee, whilst bridging discussions on interest group representation and the democratic deficit...|$|R

How does this essentially internal objective translate into international action? How does the Union respond, in an internal policy field, to external challenges? This paper will assess the ambitions and the reality of the external dimension of the EU's policy of Justice and Home Affairs from two perspectives.

40|$|The thesis {{offers a}} {{critical}} analysis of legislative acts of the European Union. The objective of the thesis is to determine what concept of legislative act obtains in EU law, and whether the objectives which were sought to be achieved by means of introduction of “language of legislation” into EU law have been achieved. The thesis concentrates on analysis of Articles 289 – 291 TFEU. After analysing <b>ordinary</b> and special <b>legislative</b> <b>procedures,</b> delegated and implementing acts, and legislative acts, it is concluded that no single concept of legislative act currently exists in EU law; the constitutive treaties offer none. The objectives (set forth in the Laeken Declaration) which were sought to be achieved by means of introduction of “language of legislation” into EU law have not been met. Aside from terminological changes the legal position currently obtaining under the Lisbon Treaty does not differ conceptually from that which obtained under the Treaty of Nice. The term “legislative act” employed in Article 289 (3) TFEU is just a shorthand denoting an act adopted via a particular procedure...|$|R

25|$|Article 294 TFEU {{outlines}} <b>ordinary</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>procedure</b> in {{the following}} manner. The Commission submits a legislative proposal to the Parliament and Council. At the first reading Parliament adopts its position. If the Council approves the Parliament's wording then the act is adopted. If not, it shall adopt its own position and pass it back to Parliament with explanations. The Commission also informs Parliament of its position on the matter. At the second reading, the act is adopted if Parliament approves the Council's text or fails to take a decision. The Parliament may reject the Council's text, leading to {{a failure of the}} law, or modify it and pass it back to the Council. The Commission gives its opinion once more.
