5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} {{by the time}} they are a year old. Females enter <b>oestrus</b> (typically five days long) from January to March. In males, {{spermatogenesis}} occurs mainly in February and March. In southern Turkmenistan, mating occurs from January to early February. The mating season is marked by noisy fights among males for dominance. Mating behaviour is similar to that in the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in <b>oestrus,</b> seizes her by {{the nape of her neck}} and mounts her. Vocalisations and flehmen are prominent during courtship. After a successful copulation, the female gives out a loud cry and reacts with aversion towards her partner. The pair then separate.|$|E
5|$|Cheetahs breed {{throughout}} the year; they are induced ovulators. Females become sexually mature at 21 to 22 months of age. Females are polyoestrusthey have an <b>oestrus</b> ("heat") cycle every 12days (this {{can vary from}} 10to 20 days), each <b>oestrus</b> lasting one to three days. A female can give birth again after 17 to 20 months; however, on {{the loss of a}} whole litter mothers can mate again. Urine-marking in males becomes more pronounced when a female in their vicinity comes into <b>oestrus.</b> Males fight among one another to secure access to the female; even males in a coalition may show some aggression toward one another on approaching a female. One male eventually wins dominance over the others. Mating, observed mainly at night, begins with the male approaching the female, who lies down on the ground. No courtship behaviour is observed; the male immediately secures hold of the female's nape and copulation takes place. The pair then ignore each other and part ways. However, they meet and copulate a few more times within the next few days. Polyandrous, females can mate with several males. The mean number of motile sperm in a single ejaculation is nearly 25.3million.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} at 10 to 14 months. A {{seasonal}} breeder, {{the time when}} mating occurs varies geographically. Mating may peak in the rainy season (August to September). When a female enters <b>oestrus</b> (which lasts for four to six days), it seeks the company of males. During courtship, the male will pursue the female, test her urine to check if she is in <b>oestrus</b> and lick her rump and flanks. Gestation lasts for six to seven months, following which a single calf is born; births peak from November to December in southern Africa. The newborn is kept in concealment for nearly a month; the mother pays regular visits to her calf to suckle it for nearly half an hour. Males may guard their offspring from predators and keep away other males. Weaning takes place at four to five months. The oribi lives for 8 to 12 years in the wild, and for 12 to 14 years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} {{by the time}} they are a year old; {{production}} of gametes begins even earlier at seven to ten months. However, successful mating takes place only at 12 to 15 months. Breeding takes place throughout the year. <b>Oestrus,</b> one to three days long, recurs every two weeks unless the female is pregnant. Females in <b>oestrus</b> show a spike in urine-marking, and form temporary pairs with males. Mating has not been extensively studied; limited number of observations suggest that copulation, that lasts nearly four minutes on an average, begins with the male smelling the areas urine-marked by the female, who rolls on the ground. Following this he approaches and mounts the female. The pair separate after copulation.|$|E
5|$|Elephants are {{polygynous}} breeders, and copulations {{are most}} frequent {{during the peak}} of the wet season. A cow in <b>oestrus</b> releases chemical signals (pheromones) in her urine and vaginal secretions to signal her readiness to mate. A bull will follow a potential mate and assess her condition with the flehmen response, which requires the male to collect a chemical sample with his trunk and bring it to the vomeronasal organ. The oestrous cycle of a cow lasts 14–16 weeks with a 4–6-week follicular phase and an 8- to 10-week luteal phase. While most mammals have one surge of luteinizing hormone during the follicular phase, elephants have two. The first (or anovulatory) surge, could signal to males that the female is in <b>oestrus</b> by changing her scent, but ovulation does not occur until the second (or ovulatory) surge. Fertility rates in cows decline around 45–50 years of age.|$|E
5|$|Mating in {{hartebeest}} {{takes place}} throughout the year, {{with one or}} two peaks that can be influenced by the availability of food. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Reproduction varies by the subspecies and local factors. Mating takes place in the territories defended by a single male, mostly in open areas. The males may fight fiercely for dominance, following which the dominant male smells the female's genitalia, and follows her if she is in <b>oestrus.</b> Sometimes a female in <b>oestrus</b> holds out her tail slightly to signal her receptivity, and the male tries to block the female's way. She may eventually stand still and allow the male to mount her. Copulation is brief and is often repeated, sometimes twice or more in a minute. Any intruder at this time is chased away. In large herds, females often mate with several males.|$|E
5|$|Typically diurnal, {{the jungle}} cat hunts {{throughout}} the day. Solitary in nature, jungle cats do not interact appreciably {{except in the}} mating season. The only prominent interaction is the mother-kitten bond. Territories are maintained by urine spraying and scent marking. The cat is primarily a carnivore, and prefers small mammals (gerbils, hares and rodents) and birds. It hunts by stalking its prey, followed by a sprint or a leap; the sharp ears help in pinpointing the location of prey. Both sexes become sexually mature {{by the time they}} are a year old; females enter <b>oestrus</b> from January to March. Mating behaviour is similar to that in the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in <b>oestrus,</b> seizes her by {{the nape of her neck}} and mounts her. Gestation lasts nearly two months. Births take place between December and June, though this might vary geographically. Kittens begin to catch their own prey at around six months and leave the mother after eight or nine months.|$|E
5|$|Scent plays a {{significant}} role in olfactory communication. Cheetahs often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then the male will itself urinate there and sniff at its own scent before leaving. Other observing individuals will repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behaviour but less prominently than the males. Females in <b>oestrus</b> will show maximum urine-marking, and her excrement can attract males from far off.|$|E
5|$|Black {{wildebeest}} act as hosts to {{a number}} of external and internal parasites. A study of the animal in Karroid Mountainveld (Eastern Cape Province, South Africa) revealed the presence of all the larval stages of the nasal bot flies <b>Oestrus</b> variolosus and Gedoelstia hässleri. The first instar larvae of G hässleri were found in large numbers on the dura mater of wildebeest calves, specially between June and August, and these later migrated to the nasal passages. Repeated outbreaks of mange (scab) have led to large-scale extinctions. The first study of the protozoa in blue and black wildebeest showed the presence of 23 protozoan species in the rumen, with Diplodinium bubalidis and Ostracodinium damaliscus common in all the animals.|$|E
5|$|Ewes {{generally}} reach {{sexual maturity}} at {{six to eight}} months of age, and rams generally at four to six (ram lambs have occasionally been known to impregnate their mothers at two months). Ewes enter into <b>oestrus</b> cycles about every 17 days, which last for approximately 30 hours. In addition to emitting a scent, they indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams. The phenomenon of the freemartin, a female bovine that is behaviorally masculine and lacks functioning ovaries, is commonly associated with cattle, but does occur to some extent in sheep. The instance of freemartins in sheep may be increasing {{in concert with the}} rise in twinning (freemartins are the result of male-female twin combinations).|$|E
5|$|Male tigers are {{generally}} more intolerant of other males within their territories than females are of other females. Territory disputes are usually solved by displays of intimidation rather than outright aggression. Several such incidents have been observed in which the subordinate tiger yielded defeat by rolling onto its back and showing its belly in a submissive posture. Once dominance has been established, a male may tolerate a subordinate within his range, {{as long as they}} do not live in too close quarters. The most aggressive disputes tend to occur between two males when a female is in <b>oestrus,</b> and may rarely result in the death of one of the males.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction in giraffes is broadly polygamous: a few older males {{mate with}} the fertile females. Male giraffes assess female {{fertility}} by tasting the female's urine to detect <b>oestrus,</b> in a multi-step {{process known as}} the flehmen response. Males prefer young adult females over juveniles and older adults. Once an oestrous female is detected, the male will attempt to court her. When courting, dominant males will keep subordinate ones at bay. A courting male may lick a female's tail, rest his head and neck on her body or nudge her with his horns. During copulation, the male stands on his hind legs with his head held up and his front legs resting on the female's sides.|$|E
5|$|Springbok mate year-round, though {{females are}} more likely to enter <b>oestrus</b> during the rainy season, when food is more plentiful. Females are able to {{conceive}} at as early as six to seven months, whereas males do not attain sexual maturity until two years; rut lasts 5 to 21 days. When a female approaches a rutting male, the male holds his head and tail at level with the ground, lowers his horns, and makes a loud grunting noise to attract her. The male then urinates and sniffs the female's perineum. If the female is receptive, she urinates, as well, and the male makes a flehmen gesture, and taps his leg till the female leaves or permits him to mate. Copulation consists of a single pelvic thrust.|$|E
5|$|The animal can be host to {{a number}} of {{different}} parasites. In one study, blue wildebeest were found to be hosts to thirteen species of nematode, one trematode, larvae of five oestrid flies, three species of lice, seven ixodid tick species, one mite and the larvae of a tongue worm. Of these, most were more prevalent at some times of the year than others. Generally, the larvae of Gedoelstica and <b>Oestrus</b> occur in the nasal passages and respiratory cavities of the blue wildebeest, and sometimes migrate to the brain. Compared to some other bovids, blue wildebeest are resistant to infestations by several species of tick.|$|E
5|$|The vegetal diet of the Sumatran {{rhinoceros}} is high {{in fiber}} and only moderate in protein. Salt licks {{are very important to}} the nutrition of the rhino. These licks can be small hot springs, seepages of salty water, or mud-volcanoes. The salt licks also serve an important social purpose for the rhinos—males visit the licks to pick up the scent of females in <b>oestrus.</b> Some Sumatran rhinos, however, live in areas where salt licks are not readily available, or the rhinos have not been observed using the licks. These rhinos may get their necessary mineral requirements by consuming plants rich in minerals.|$|E
5|$|A {{dominant}} male black wildebeest {{will have}} a harem of females and will not allow other males to mate with them. The breeding season occurs {{at the end of}} the rainy season and lasts a few weeks between February and April. When one of his females comes into <b>oestrus</b> the male concentrates on her and mates with her several times. Sexual behaviour by the male at this time includes stretching low, ears down, sniffing of the female's vulva, performing ritual urination and touching his chin to the female's rump. At the same time, the female keeps her tail upwards (sometimes vertically) or swishes it across the face of the male. The pair usually separates after copulation, but the female occasionally follows her mate afterwards, touching his rump with her snout. During the breeding season, the male loses condition as he spends little time grazing. Males are known to mount other males.|$|E
5|$|Active mainly {{during the}} day, the impala may be gregarious or {{territorial}} {{depending upon the}} climate and geography. Three distinct social groups can be observed: the territorial males, bachelor herds and female herds. The impala is known for two characteristic leaps that constitute an anti-predator strategy. Browsers as well as grazers, impala feed on monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits and acacia pods (whenever available). An annual, three-week-long rut takes place {{toward the end of}} the wet season, typically in May. Rutting males fight over dominance, and the victorious male courts female in <b>oestrus.</b> Gestation lasts six to seven months, following which a single calf is born and immediately concealed in cover. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males—forced out of the all-female groups—join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mating}} season, rutting males move about {{in search of}} females in <b>oestrus.</b> Males become {{aggressive}} and fight among themselves for dominance. These fights are characterised by displays of the enlarged chest, the throat patch and the beard while holding the head upright; and threatening the opponent by running with the horns pointed toward him and circling him. The victorious bull would protect {{the vicinity of the}} targeted female from other males. The courtship typically lasts for 45 minutes. The male, stiff and composed, approaches the receptive female, who keeps her head low to the ground and may slowly walk forward. The male licks her genitalia, upon which the female holds her tail to a side and the male gives out a flehmen response. Finally, the male pushes his chest against her rump, and mounts her.|$|E
5|$|Koalas are {{seasonal}} breeders, and births {{take place}} {{from the middle}} of spring through the summer to early autumn, from October to May. Females in <b>oestrus</b> tend to hold their heads further back than usual and commonly display tremors and spasms. However, males do not appear to recognise these signs, and have been observed to mount non-oestrous females. Because of his much larger size, a male can usually force himself on a female, mounting her from behind, and in extreme cases, the male may pull the female out of the tree. A female may scream and vigorously fight off her suitors, but will submit to one that is dominant or is more familiar. The bellows and screams that accompany matings can attract other males to the scene, obliging the incumbent to delay mating and fight off the intruders. These fights may allow the female to assess which is dominant. Older males usually have accumulated scratches, scars, and cuts on the exposed parts of their noses and on their eyelids.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are sexually}} mature {{by the time}} they are a year old, though {{successful}} mating generally occurs only after four years. Mature males start establishing territories and try to gain access to females. Females can conceive after they are {{a year and a half}} old; <b>oestrus</b> lasts for 24 to 48 hours, and occurs every 12–29 days in non-pregnant females. The annual three-week-long rut (breeding season) begins toward the end of the wet season, typically in May. Gonadal growth and hormone production in males begin a few months before the breeding season, resulting in greater aggressiveness and territoriality. The bulbourethral glands are heavier, testosterone levels are nearly twice as high in territorial males as in bachelors, and the neck of a territorial male tends to be thicker than that of a bachelor during the rut. Mating tends to take place between full moons.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} <b>oestrus</b> itself, when the female is {{receptive}} to the male, lasts about 24 hours, and observations have placed its recurrence between 21 and 25 days. Rhinos in the Cincinnati Zoo have been observed copulating for 30–50 minutes, similar in length to other rhinos; observations at the Sumatran Rhinoceros Conservation Centre in Malaysia have shown a briefer copulation cycle. As the Cincinnati Zoo has had successful pregnancies, and other rhinos also have lengthy copulatory periods, a lengthy rut may be the natural behavior. Though researchers observed successful conceptions, all these pregnancies ended in failure {{for a variety of}} reasons until the first successful captive birth in 2001; studies of these failures at the Cincinnati Zoo discovered the Sumatran rhino's ovulation is induced by mating and it had unpredictable progesterone levels. Breeding success was finally achieved in 2001, 2004, and 2007 by providing a pregnant rhino with supplementary progestin.|$|E
25|$|Copulation {{may occur}} {{in or out}} of water, and in captivity, mating pairs will often copulate {{multiple}} times during <b>oestrus.</b> Intromission lasts between 10 and 20 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Cases of {{accidental}} {{breeding of}} wolfdogs are known (though {{this is very}} rare), where a domestic dog female in <b>oestrus</b> strays and is mated by a male wild wolf.|$|E
25|$|Pheromonal cues aid {{synchronization}} of <b>oestrus</b> in many species; in women, synchronized menstruation {{may also}} arise from pheromonal cues, although {{the role of}} pheromones in humans is disputed.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{maturity}} {{is reached}} within Breeding takes place throughout the year, with peaks that vary geographically. Sperms are produced year-round, though testosterone levels register a fall {{during the development}} of the antlers. Females have regular <b>oestrus</b> cycles, each lasting three weeks. The female can conceive again two weeks to four months after the birth. Males sporting hard antlers are dominant over those in velvet or those without antlers, irrespective of their size. Courtship is based on tending bonds. A rutting male fasts during the mating season and follow and guard a female in <b>oestrus.</b> The pair will do several bouts of chasing and mutual licking before copulation.|$|E
25|$|Breeding {{behavior}} {{is complex and}} often involves three or more animals. Both male and female whales reach puberty at approximately eight years of age. Females show highly synchronized reproduction, undergoing <b>oestrus</b> in late November to early December. During the breeding season, {{it is common for}} females to have several mates. This single ovulation event is believed to coincide with the species’ annual migration patterns, when births can occur in warmer waters. Most females show biennial reproduction, although annual births have been reported. Males also show seasonal changes, experiencing an increase in testes mass that correlates with the time females undergo <b>oestrus.</b> Currently there are no accounts of twin births, although an instance of twins in utero has been reported.|$|E
25|$|Female {{resistance}} to mate guarding {{has also been}} researched {{in the context of}} the menstrual cycle. Pillsworth, Haselton and Buss (2004) found that women are more likely to want to mate with males they are not currently pair bonded with during the ovulation period of their menstrual cycle. They also show higher mate guarding resistance in general during <b>oestrus.</b> This is supported by the finding that during ovulation women who are both single or in a monogamous partnership with a man are more likely to desire to go to social gatherings where they may meet alternative mates. This is said to support the female dual mating strategy theory, as during <b>oestrus</b> women may be seeking out mates with strong genes.|$|E
25|$|Typical genera are Hypoderma, Gasterophilus, Dermatobia and <b>Oestrus.</b> Oestrid flies {{at their}} larval stage {{tend to be}} adapted to feed on a few closely related species of host animal and the adult females fly {{actively}} to seek out only these hosts on which to lay their eggs.|$|E
25|$|Eri-Aaroni {{proved to}} be {{successful}} at stud. During his first breeding season in Laihia, his pregnancy rate was 75.2 percent. He was accurate in detecting whether a mare was in <b>oestrus</b> or not, and {{did not attempt to}} serve pregnant mares. However, he also was uninterested in serving nursing mares, which was problematic. During the busiest peaks of breeding seasons Eri-Aaroni had to serve mares as often as every three hours, but as he ate well, he did not grow weak.|$|E
25|$|Snow leopards are unusual among large cats in {{that they}} have a {{well-defined}} birth peak. They usually mate in late winter, marked by a noticeable increase in marking and calling. Snow leopards have a gestation period of 90–100 days, so the cubs are born between April and June. <b>Oestrus</b> typically lasts from five to eight days, and males tend not to seek out another partner after mating, probably because the short mating season does not allow sufficient time. Paired snow leopards mate in the usual felid posture, from 12 to 36 times a day.|$|E
25|$|Yaks mate in the summer, {{typically}} between July and September, {{depending on}} the local environment. For {{the remainder of the}} year, many bulls wander in small bachelor groups away from the large herds, but, as the rut approaches, they become aggressive and regularly fight among each other to establish dominance. In addition to non-violent threat displays, bellowing, and scraping the ground with their horns, bull yaks also compete more directly, repeatedly charging at each other with heads lowered or sparring with their horns. Like bison, but unlike cattle, males wallow in dry soil during the rut, often while scent-marking with urine or dung. Females enter <b>oestrus</b> up to four times a year, and females are receptive only for a few hours in each cycle.|$|E
25|$|While GnRH {{immunity}} {{has been}} known to have contraceptive effects for some time, only in the 2000s has it been used to develop several commercial vaccines. Equity® <b>Oestrus</b> Control is a GnRH vaccine marketed for use in non-breeding domestic horses. Repro-Bloc is GnRH vaccine marketed for use in domestic animals in general. Improvac® is a GnRH vaccine marketed for use in pigs not as a contraceptive, but as an alternative to physical castration for the control of boar taint. Unlike the other products which are marketed for use in domestic animals, GonaCon™ is a GnRH vaccine being developed as a United States Department of Agriculture initiative for use for control of wildlife, specifically deer. GonaCon has also been used on a trial basis to control kangaroos in Australia.|$|E
25|$|The {{proboscis}} of the tapir is {{a highly}} flexible organ, able to move in all directions, allowing the animals to grab foliage {{that would otherwise be}} out of reach. Tapirs often exhibit the flehmen response, a posture in which they raise their snouts and show their teeth to detect scents. This response is frequently exhibited by bulls sniffing for signs of other males or females in <b>oestrus</b> in the area. The length of the proboscis varies among species; Malayan tapirs have the longest snouts and Brazilian tapirs have the shortest. The evolution of tapir probosces, made up almost entirely of soft tissues rather than bony internal structures, gives the Tapiridae skull a unique form in comparison to other perissodactyls, with a larger sagittal crest, orbits positioned more rostrally, a posteriorly telescoped cranium, and a more elongated and retracted nasoincisive incisure.|$|E
25|$|Obligate myiasis {{of various}} forms {{are typical of}} the oestrid genera. Larval Dermatobia torsalo-flies infest the skin and {{underlying}} tissues of cattle causing distress, reduced gain in weight and damage to skins used for leather. Larval Gasterophilus stomach-bots infest the upper gastric tract and stomach of horses and other equids. Larval Hypoderma warble-flies infest the skin and muscles of cattle. Larval <b>Oestrus</b> nasal-bots infest the nasal cavities of sheep and goats. In the case of stomach-bots it is often uncertain how much clinical disease or loss of production small levels of infestation causes the host. With infestations of warble-flies and nasal-bots severe distress to the hosts may be caused and there are production losses from reduction of value of cattle hides, and reduced grazing time by sheep. Harm to cattle may be caused through panic (known as gadding) at {{the approach of the}} flies if that leads to traumatic injury. There are no organisms of known importance transmitted by oestrid flies.|$|E
25|$|FCC proponents {{argue that}} {{menstruation}} became a key problem because it potentially creates {{conflicts between the}} females and conflicts between males. Menstruation has little social impact among chimpanzees or bonobos, since visible <b>oestrus</b> swellings {{are the focus of}} male attention. But once external signs of ovulation had been phased out in the human lineage, according to FCC, menstruation became salient as the one remaining external promise of fertility. Potentially, dominant males might exploit such information, repeatedly targeting newly cycling females at the expense of pregnant or nursing mothers (figure e). Those who might lose male investment needed to take control. According to FCC, older and more experienced females did this by initiating newly cycling females into their kin-based coalitions (figures f, g). Red ochre pigments allowed women to take conscious control over their signals, resisting any dominant male strategy of picking and choosing between them on biological grounds. It is argued that because precise, sustained menstrual synchrony is difficult to achieve, painting up with blood-red pigments was the next best thing, enabling the benefits of artificial, ritually constructed synchrony.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{constantly}} recurring claims of radical differences in behaviour and biology, a single annual breeding cycle, seasonal adapted <b>oestrus,</b> monogamy, parental care by the males, {{regulation of breeding}} via ecological and social factors, and howling have all been observed among domestic dogs of most diverse backgrounds. Howling is considered normal for all wild dogs of Australia. Hybrids {{as well as other}} domestic dogs have been observed in tight pack structures and free-ranging domestic dogs in Southeast-Australia have been observed hunting and foraging in groups. Free-ranging dogs in Victoria were generally observed in pairs (54%) or alone (34%), with packs of three to seven dogs in 12% of the sightings. Furthermore, there are also reports of dingoes with more than average size and weight and cases where hybrids were successfully used as working and companion dogs and the Australian Cattle Dog was proven to have dingo ancestors. A generally higher aggression of hybrids could not be confirmed by owners, who worked with respectively investigated them; furthermore hitherto observations and encounters with hybrids in the wild did not reveal any evidence, that hybrids are generally more aggressive than “pure” dingoes.|$|E
