A useful choice is the short-circuit current output of the amplifier (leading to the short-circuit current gain).

25|$|Sentinel node may simplify certain list operations, by {{ensuring}} that the next or previous nodes exist for every element, and that even empty lists {{have at least one}} node. One may also use a sentinel node {{at the end of the}} list, with an appropriate data field, to eliminate some end-of-list tests. For example, when scanning the list looking for a node with a given value x, setting the sentinel's data field to x makes it unnecessary to test for end-of-list inside the loop. Another example is the merging two sorted lists: if their sentinels have data fields set to +∞, the choice of the next <b>output</b> <b>node</b> does not need special handling for empty lists.|$|E

40|$|The Cascade-Correlation {{architecture}} {{which is}} designed for classification tasks has been studied {{to see if it}} can be modified to perform function evaluation and interpolation tasks. 1. Introduction It is well known that the Cascade-Correlation (Cascor) architecture developed by Fahlman [2] results in a very powerful classification system. In this system it is typical to have as many <b>output</b> <b>nodes</b> as there are classes and to train them to give one of two extreme values. The activation function of the <b>output</b> <b>nodes</b> is non-linear, typically a squashing function such as a sigmoid. Under these circumstances what is important is that the input to the squashing function has a value that effectively forces the node to be hard on or hard off. The actual value needed to do this is of less importance. For such tasks as function evaluation and interpolation the actual output values are important. In these cases linear activation functions are used in the <b>output</b> <b>node(s).</b> If Cascor is used in this m [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Neural networks, {{trained with}} the {{backpropagation}} algorithm have: {{been applied to}} various classification problems. For linearly separable and nonseparahle problems, they {{have been shown to}} approximate the a posteriori probability of an input vector X belonging to a specific class C. In order to achieve high accuracy, large training data sets have to be used. For a small number of input dimensions, the accuracy of estimation was inferior to estimates using the Parzen density estimation. In this thesis, we propose two new techniques, lowering the mean square estimation error drastically and achieving better classification. In the past, t:he desired output patterns used for training have been of binary nature, using one for the class C the vector belongs to, and zero for the other classes. This work will show that by training against the columns of a Hadamard matrix, and then taking the inverse Hadamard transform of the network output, we can obtain more accurate estimates. The second change proposed in comparison with standard backpropagation networks will be the use of redundant <b>output</b> <b>nodes.</b> In standard backpropagat:ion the number of <b>output</b> <b>nodes</b> equals the number of different classes. In this thesis, it is shown that adding redundant <b>output</b> <b>nodes</b> enables us to decrease the mean square error at the output further, reaching better classification and lower mean square error rates than the Parzen density estimator. Comparisons between the statistical methods, the Parzen density estimation and histogramming, the conventional neural network and the Hadamard transformed neural network with redundant <b>output</b> <b>nodes</b> are given. Further, the effects of the proposed changes to the backpropagation algorithm on the convergence speed and the risk of getting stuck in a local minimum are: studied...|$|R

The learning rate is decreased for all individual <b>output</b> <b>nodes</b> each time the error is less than a user chosen multiple of the rms error corresponding to the previous pass.

In CMOS logic, a collection of n-type MOSFETs are arranged in a pull-down network between the <b>output</b> <b>node</b> and the lower-voltage power supply rail, named Vss, which often has ground potential. By asserting or de-asserting the inputs to the CMOS circuit, individual transistors along the pull-up and pull-down networks become conductive and resistive to electric current, and results in the desired path connecting from the <b>output</b> <b>node</b> to one of the voltage rails.|$|E
