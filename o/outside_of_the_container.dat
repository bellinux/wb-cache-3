5000|$|A metal object C (Faraday used a brass ball {{suspended}} by a nonconductive silk thread, but modern experiments often {{use a small}} metal ball or disk mounted on an insulating handle) is charged with electricity using an electrostatic machine and lowered into the container A [...] without touching it [...] As it is lowered the charge detectors reading increases, indicating that the <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container</b> is becoming charged. Once the object is well inside {{the lip of the}} container the charge detector levels off and registers a constant charge, even if the object is lowered further. The charge on the <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container</b> is the same polarity as that on the object. If the charge detector is touched to the inside surface of the container, it is found to be charged with opposite polarity. For example, if the object C has a positive charge, the <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container</b> A will be found to have a positive charge, while the inside of the container has a negative charge.|$|E

50|$|In Procedure 5, when C is touched to the {{container}}'s inner wall, all {{the charge}} on C flows out and neutralizes the induced charge, leaving both the inner wall and C uncharged.

50|$|An {{alternate}} way {{of conducting}} the experiment: after the charged object C is {{lowered into the}} container in Procedure 2, the outside surface of the container is momentarily grounded. The charge on the <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container</b> all drains off to ground, and the charge detector declines to zero, leaving the charge {{on the inside of}} the container, equal but opposite to that on C. Then the object C is removed from the container. Since C is no longer present to hold the induced charge on the inside surface of the container, it migrates to the <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container.</b> so the charge detector registers an equal but opposite charge from its previous reading. This new charge can be proved to be equal and opposite to the charge on C by touching C to the exterior surface of the container. The two charges exactly neutralize each other, so both the exterior of the container and C are found to be uncharged.|$|E

5000|$|An {{important}} {{conclusion that}} {{can be drawn from}} this is that the net charge inside a closed conducting container is always zero, even if a charged object is put in.

50|$|As {{water is}} poured onto the fuel, it quickly sinks {{to the bottom}} of the {{container}} due to the water's higher density, and has little effect on extinguishing the flames on the surface. Under certain conditions, after some time, the water on the bottom rapidly vaporises into steam, causing it to expand more than 1700 times in volume. The rapidly expanding steam (possibly superheated) expels the oil or fuel above upward and out of the tank, resulting in the discharging of burning oil onto a large and uncontrolled area <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container.</b> Mathematical modelling of the phenomenon is difficult and complicated, making boilover prediction unreliable.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{there is}} no {{electric}} field in the intervening volume of the metal, the charge distribution on the outside surface of the container and its electric field is completely unaffected by the charges inside the container. [...] If the charged object inside the container is moved about as in Procedure 3, the induced charge distribution on the inside surface will redistribute itself, maintaining the cancellation of the electric fields outside the inner surface. So the charges on the outside surface will be completely unaffected, along with any charges in the outside world. From the outside, the metal container acts exactly like it simply has a surface charge +Q, with no charges inside. Similarly, if an external charge is brought near the container from outside, the induced charge distribution on the outside surface will redistribute to cancel its electric field inside the container. So the charges inside the container will not [...] "feel" [...] any electric field and will not change. In summary, the regions inside and <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container</b> are electrically isolated from each other, electric fields from one region cannot penetrate or affect the other.

However, more than 90 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> society uses biomass as a main source of energy for cooking {{due to lack of}} technologies to convert this energy. Replacing these cooking activities by using renewable energy resources decreases pollution and reduces deforestation significantly. Using the solar energy in day time has no problem. For night time however, the system needs some kind of back-up system to make the daytime solar energy available. This back-up should have high-density energy storage and constant working temperature to perform a specific application. Latent heat storage using phase change materials (PCM) is one way of storing thermal energy. In the current study, a latent heat storage that uses a PCM material is used to store the solar energy aimed at utilizing solar energy for cooking Injera, main staple bread in Ethiopia.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 45) This study determined {{an acceptable}} {{design of a}} fuel handling machine to refuel future liquid metal fast breeder reactors (LMFBR). To date, approximately seven fuel handling machines have been designed' and built for small scale liquid metal cooled reactors. Limitations of these previously operated handling devices eliminated their use for, the LMFBR. A study was therefore performed to establish a simple machine to meet the more stringent design safety criteria for the future LMFBR spent fuel assemblies. This study was however restricted to only those aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design believed to be particularly critical for such a fuel handling machine. Once these critical design: aspects are satisfied, the detailed design can be prepared by more conventional design techniques. Fuel assemblies from the reactor must be removed periodically and, replaced with new fuel assemblies. The heat generated by the fission products in these spent fuel assemblies can cause the assemblies to melt unless adequate cooling is provided. The cooling system is therefore the most critical component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuel handling machine. Since provision for adequate heat removal from a spent fuel assembly is the most critical aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design, two independent heat removal systems are suggested to provide near complete redundancy. Each heat transfer system must be capable <b>of</b> removing <b>the</b> entire 27 Kw generated internally in the spent assembly being removed. Sodium in the liquid state is used to transfer heat from the fuel assembly to <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transfer <b>container.</b> In one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two independent cooling systems, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decay heat is transferred froi <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transfer <b>container</b> to an air-cooled cold wall by radiation. In the second cooling system, cold argon is pumped around <b>the</b> transfer <b>container</b> and through an air-to-argon heat exchanger to remove all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decay heat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spent fuel assembly by convection. Selection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shielding material and the shielding dimension is the second critical design problem considered. The choice for shielding material is based on raw material costs, ease of fabrication, and shielding performance. No definitive answer exists to this selection problem, but {{this study showed that}} cast steel would be the best shielding material for this application. A flexible member must be used to raise and lower the fuel handling machine's grapple into and out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reactor liquid sodium. To date none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquid metal reactor fuel handling machines have been designed with this constraint. <b>The</b> design <b>of</b> this component represented the third critical aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machine. The results show that log chain would be <b>the</b> best choice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five alternative considered.

40|$|The {{unusually high}} surface tension of room {{temperature}} liquid metal is molding it as unique material for diverse newly emerging areas. However, unlike its practices on earth, such metal fluid would display very different behaviors when working in space where gravity disappears and surface property dominates the major physics. So far, few direct evidences {{are available to}} understand such effect which would impede further exploration of liquid metal use for space. Here to preliminarily probe into this intriguing issue, a low cost experimental strategy to simulate microgravity environment on earth was proposed through adopting bridges with high enough free falling distance as the test platform. Then using digital cameras amounted along x, y, z directions on <b>outside</b> wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transparent <b>container</b> with liquid metal and allied solution inside, synchronous observations on the transient flow and transformational activities of liquid metal were performed. Meanwhile, an unmanned aerial vehicle was adopted to record the whole free falling dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test capsule from the far end which can help justify subsequent experimental procedures. A series of typical fundamental phenomena were thus observed as: (a) A relatively large liquid metal object would spontaneously transform from its original planar pool state into a sphere and float in <b>the</b> <b>container</b> if initiating <b>the</b> free falling; (b) The liquid metal changes its three-dimensional shape due to dynamic microgravity strength due to free falling and rebound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test capsule; and (c) A quick spatial transformation of liquid metal immersed in the solution can easily be induced via external electrical fields. <b>The</b> mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface tension driven liquid metal actuation in space were interpreted.

40|$|A {{container}} {{designed for}} storing samples of hazardous material features a double wall, {{part of which}} is sacrificed during an explosion-welding {{process in which the}} container is sealed and transferred to a clean environment. The major advantage of this container sealing process is that once the samples have been sealed inside, the outer wall of what remains of the container is a clean surface that has not come into contact with the environment from which the samples were taken. Thus, {{there is no need to}} devise a decontamination process capable of mitigating all hazards that might be posed by unanticipated radioactive, chemical, and/or biological contamination of the <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container.</b> The container sealing method was originally intended to be used to return samples from Mars to Earth, but it could also be used to store samples of hazardous materials, without the need to decontaminate its outer surface.

Material and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 458 cases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> occupational exposure to biological agents was conducted: group I – doctors (N = 121, 28 %), group II – nursing staff (N = 251, 55 %), group III – nCHP (N = 86, 19 %). Results: In the group III the source was usually unknown (group: I – 0. 83 %, II – 11. 16 %, III – 86. 05 %, p < 0. 001), and <b>the</b> proportion <b>of</b> individuals vaccinated against hepatitis B before the exposure was the lowest (group: I – 98. 35 %, II – 97. 19 %, III – 77. 91 %, p < 0. 001). In this group most exposures resulted from injuries caused by needles/sharps deposited in waste sacks (60 %) or anywhere <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medical waste <b>container</b> (5 %). <b>The</b> possibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HBV infection risk during the exposure was found in 25 cases and was significantly more frequent in the group III. The qualification for the HBV post-exposure prophylaxis was also significantly more frequent in the group III. Conclusions: The exposure to <b>the</b> occupational risk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HBV infection also concerns the non-clinical healthcare personnel. The non-clinical healthcare personnel comprises one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main groups <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HBV post-exposure recipients. It is essential to determine <b>the</b> causes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low hepatitis B vaccination coverage in the nCHP and consider introduction of mandatory vaccination in this group in Poland.

50|$|Luna 2 carried 5 {{different}} {{instruments to}} conduct various tests {{while it was}} on its way to the Moon. The scintillation counters would be used to measure any ionizing radiation; the Cherenkov radiation detectors would be measuring for electromagnetic radiation caused by charged particles. “The Geiger Counter carried on Luna 2 had the primary scientific objective <b>of</b> determining <b>the</b> electron spectrum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer radiation belt. <b>The</b> instrument consisted <b>of</b> three STS-5 gas-discharge counters mounted on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hermetically sealed <b>container,</b> and would be powered by a 360 V battery”. The last instrument on Luna 2 was, “a three component fluxgate magnetometer similar to that used on Luna 1 but with the dynamic range reduced by a factor of 4 to -750 to +750 gammas so that the quantization uncertainty was -12 to +12 gammas.” Together the devices were searching for lunar magnetic and radiation fields similar to the Van Allen radiation belt around earth sending information about once every minute until its last transmission which came about 55 km away from the lunar surface. Although it did prove previous measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Van Allen radiation belts that were taken from Luna 1 around the Earth, it was not able to detect any type of radiation belts around <b>the</b> moon. Because <b>of</b> claims that information received from Luna 1 was fake, as soon as <b>the</b> scientists <b>of</b> Luna 2 starting receiving transmissions they sent out <b>the</b> intended time <b>of</b> impact, and <b>the</b> transmission and trajectory details. Even though Soviet scientists gave all this information Americans were still skeptical until Bernard Lovell was able to prove that the radio signal was coming from Luna 2 by showing the Doppler shift from its transmissions. After this no one seemed to question <b>the</b> validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviets.|$|R

The test body is inserted into the measuring unit. The test bodies are arranged in <b>the</b> reactor <b>container.</b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for producing biofilm (2) causing biogenic sulfuric acid corrosion on a surface of a test body (4) arranged in a reactor container (3) of a bioreactor (1), comprises inoculating the test body with microorganisms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> Thiobacillus and if necessary with other microorganisms and releasing a hydrogen sulfide gas flow in <b>the</b> reactor <b>container</b> to produce a hydrogen sulfide containing gas atmosphere in <b>the</b> surrounding region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test body. The test body is inserted in the measuring unit. The test bodies are arranged in <b>the</b> reactor <b>container.</b> <b>The</b> hydrogen sulfide gas flow is led to each surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test bodies and is fed from <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reactor <b>container</b> and/or <b>the</b> hydrogen sulfide gas flow is produced in <b>the</b> reactor <b>container.</b> <b>The</b> hydrogen sulfide concentration in a gas chamber <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reactor <b>container</b> partially surrounding <b>the</b> test body is adjusted to a value of {{less than or equal}} to 100 ppm. <b>The</b> reactor <b>container</b> is partially filled with an aqueous solution (7), which is heated at a given temperature of 35 degrees C, is mixed with a nutrient solution and is inoculated with the microorganisms. The test body for inoculating the microorganisms is sprayed with the aqueous solution having the microorganisms. The test body is arranged in <b>the</b> reactor <b>container,</b> so that a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test body dips in the liquid phase. The hydrogen sulfide gas flow is released in the region below from a liquid level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquid phase. The test body is sprayed once with the aqueous solution at an interval <b>of</b> 24 hours. <b>The</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test body arranged in the gas chamber is partially sprayed out by gas pressure surges from the aqueous solution. The gas pressure surges are caused by supply <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hydrogen sulfide gas flow in the liquid phase. <b>The</b> pH-value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aqueous solution is adjusted to a value of 1. 0 - 2. 0. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a bioreactor for producing biofilm causing biogenic sulfuric acid corrosion on a surface of a test body. USE - Method for producing biofilm causing biogenic sulfuric acid corrosion on a surface of a test body arranged in a reactor container of a bioreactor (claimed) useful in piping systems and sewage systems. ADVANTAGE - The method ensures effective production of biofilm causing biogenic sulfuric acid corrosion on a surface of a test body in the reactor with high hydrogen sulfide concentration in sufficient manner, sufficient moistening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test body, to test <b>the</b> resistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> materials reproducible against the biogenic sulfuric acid corrosion in less-time consuming manner...|$|R
