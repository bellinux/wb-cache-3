5|$|Being {{the most}} {{abundant}} carnivores, feral and free-ranging dogs have the greatest potential to compete with wolves. A review of the studies in the competitive effects <b>of</b> <b>dogs</b> on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves. Competition would favor the wolf, which is known to kill dogs, however wolves tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large groups <b>of</b> <b>dogs.</b>|$|E

5|$|Many petroglyphs or carved images <b>of</b> <b>dogs</b> {{were found}} near {{religious}} centers and chiefly residential areas indicating their venerated status and {{importance in the}} culture. A survey by American archaeologist Sidsel N.

Their regional distributions possibly reflected the role <b>of</b> <b>dogs</b> as symbols of tribal/clan loyalty and identity in the islands. They were totem animals associated with the Nakiʻi tribe.|$|E

40|$|Dog {{walking is}} {{associated}} {{with higher levels of}} physical activity (PA). However, not all dog owners walk their dog(s) at a level sufficient for health benefits. Therefore, identifying correlates <b>of</b> <b>dog</b> walking may help to inform the design of more effective interventions to promote this specific form of PA. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine psychosocial and environmental correlates <b>of</b> <b>dog</b> walking and relationships <b>of</b> <b>dog</b> walking with overall PA. In 2010, 391 dog owners (Mage= 43. 6 ± 12. 3 years) completed a survey. Multiple logistic regression and structural equation modeling were used to examine psychosocial and environmental correlates <b>of</b> <b>dog</b> walking status, weekly minutes <b>of</b> <b>dog</b> walking and relationships <b>of</b> <b>dog</b> walking with overall PA. Self-efficacy for dog walking, dog-related outcome expectancies, family social support, dog social support, and neighborhood walking environment were associated with a 1. 3 to 5. 6 greater odds <b>of</b> being a <b>dog</b> walker. Self-efficacy mediated relationships between family support, dog support, and presence of a yard and dog walking. Neighborhood environment, including the presence of greenery and trails, was also positively associated with duration <b>of</b> <b>dog</b> walking (β= 0. 17;...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the numbers}} <b>of</b> <b>dogs</b> killed {{each year are}} {{relatively}} low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs.

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the behaviour and attitudes <b>of</b> <b>dog</b> walkers to picking up and disposing <b>of</b> <b>dog</b> foul, with a specific focus on bagged dog waste. Two research methods were utilised. The first explores locational and social factors influencing dog walkers’ behaviour in picking up and disposing <b>of</b> <b>dog</b> faeces. Dog waste audits were conducted on popular dog walking paths in Lancashire. Secondly, the results were used to deliver an online national dog walking survey. Results of the audits suggested that availability of bins, path morphology, visibility, and path location are key factors in determining the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>dog</b> faeces. In the survey a key factor influencing behaviour was the belief that clearing up after dogs is the “right thing to do” and this was associated with an awareness of health risks. Typologies <b>of</b> <b>dog</b> walker are also proposed heuristically, ranging from those dog walkers that are ‘proud to pick up’ who will pick up in any location, through those who make contextual judgements about where and when it could be permissible to leave dog waste, to the ‘disengaged’ who will not pick up {{even if they are}} aware of the health and environmental consequences. The study advocates active engagement <b>of</b> <b>dog</b> walkers in tackling this contested, potentially environmentally damaging issue...|$|R
