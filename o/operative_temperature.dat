40|$|We {{describe}} a research protocol for evaluating temperature regulation from data on small field-active ectothermic animals, especially lizards. The protocol requires data on body temperatures (Tb) of field-active ectotherms, on available <b>operative</b> <b>temperatures</b> (Te, “null temperatures” for nonregulating animals), {{and on the}} thermoregulatory set-point range (preferred body temperatures, Tset). These data are used to estimate several quantitative indexes that collectively summarize temperature regulation: the “precision” of body temperature (variance in Tb, or an equivalent metric), the “accuracy” of body temperature relative to the set-point range (the average difference between Tb and Tset), and the “effectiveness” of thermoregulation (the extent to which body temperatures are closer on the average to the set-point range than are <b>operative</b> <b>temperatures).</b> If additional data on the thermal dependence of performance are available, the impact of thermoregulation on performance (the extent to which performance is enhanced relative to that of nonregulating animals) can also be estimated. A sample analysis of the thermal biology of three Anolis lizards in Puerto Rico demonstrates {{the utility of the}} new protocol and its superiority to previous methods of evaluating temperature regulation.

40|$|It is {{possible}} to evaluate the energy demand {{as well as the}} parameters related to indoor thermal comfort through building energy simulation tools. Since energy demand for heating and cooling is directly affected by the required level of thermal comfort, the investigation of the mutual relationship between thermal comfort and energy demand (and therefore operating costs) is of the foremost importance both to define the benchmarks for energy service contracts and to calibrate the energy labelling according to European Directive 2002 / 92 /CE. The connection between indoor thermal comfort conditions and energy demand for both heating and cooling has been analyzed in this work with reference to a set of validation tests (office buildings) derived from a European draft standard. Once a range of required acceptable indoor <b>operative</b> <b>temperatures</b> had been fixed in accordance with Fanger's theory (e. g. 0. 5 < PMV < 0. 5), the effective hourly comfort conditions and the energy consumptions were estimated through dynamic simulations.

40|$|In {{building}} energy simulation, indoor {{thermal comfort}} condition, energy use and equipment size are typically calculated {{based on the}} assumption that the clothing insulation is equal to a constant value of 0. 5 clo during the cooling season and 1. 0 clo during heating season. The assumption is not reflected in practice and thus it may lead to errors. In reality, occupants frequently adjust their clothing depending on the thermal conditions, as opposed to the assumption of constant clothing values above, indicating that the clothing insulation variation should be captured in building simulation software to obtain more reliable and accurate results. In this study, the impact of three newly developed dynamic clothing insulation models on the building simulation is quantitatively assessed using the detailed whole-building energy simulation program, EnergyPlus version 6. 0. The results showed that when the HVAC is controlled based on indoor temperature the dynamic clothing models do not affect indoor <b>operative</b> <b>temperatures,</b> energy consumption and equipment sizing. When the HVAC is controlled based on the PMV model the use of a fixed clothing insulation during the cooling (0. 5 clo) and heating (1. 0 clo) season leads to the incorrect estimation of the indoor <b>operative</b> <b>temperatures,</b> energy consumption and equipment sizing. The dynamic clothing models significantly (p< 0. 0001) improve the ability of energy simulation tools to assess thermal comfort.

50|$|What we {{experience}} and feel relating to thermal comfort {{in a building}} {{is related to the}} influence of both the air temperature and the temperature of surfaces in that space.

50|$|This method, {{also known}} as the {{adaptive}} comfort model, is applicable in buildings without mechanical cooling (and no operating heating system) where occupants’ met rates are 1.0-1.3 met and their clothing levels are 0.5-1.0 clo.

An accompanying table lists provisions for higher <b>operative</b> <b>temperatures</b> at air speeds above 0.3 m/s and up to 1.2 m/s.

Users provide <b>operative</b> <b>temperature</b> (or air temperature and mean radiant temperature), air speed, humidity, metabolic rate, and clothing insulation value, and the tool evaluates predicted thermal sensation on a scale from -3 (cold) to +3 (hot). Compliance is achieved if the conditions provide thermal neutrality, measured as falling between -0.5 and +0.5 on the PMV scale.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} steps are guidelines {{provided by the}} USGBC for LEED credit in thermal comfort. First, thermal comfort goals must be established by determining if indoor thermal variation is acceptable (or if it must be tightly controlled) and if natural conditioning is a benefit desired by the occupants.

Then thermal controls should be established that give the occupant control over air speed, <b>operative</b> <b>temperature,</b> radiant temperature, and humidity such as ceiling fans, thermostats, operable windows, underfloor diffusers, etc. Finally, a standard must be chosen that best fits the project from ASHRAE Standard 55-2013, ISO 7730-2005, or EN15251-2007.|$|E

[...] The addition to the standard, 5.3: Optional Method For Determining Acceptable Thermal Conditions in Naturally Ventilated Spaces, uses an adaptive thermal comfort approach for naturally conditioned buildings by specifying acceptable <b>operative</b> <b>temperature</b> ranges for naturally conditioned spaces. As a result, the design of natural ventilation systems became more feasible, which was acknowledged by ASHRAE as a way to further sustainable, energy efficient, and occupant-friendly design.|$|E

40|$|A {{field study}} {{was carried out}} {{to assess the impact}} of {{installing}} a desktop task/ambient conditioning (TAC) system at 42 selected workstations within three San Francisco office buildings occupied by a large financial institution. In this study, field measurements, including subjective surveys and physical monitoring, were performed both before and after the TAC system installation to evaluate the impact of the TAC system on occupant satisfaction and thermal comfort, as well as the thermal environments within the office buildings. For comparative purposes within each building, a control group, consisting of workers who did not receive a desktop TAC unit, was studied concurrently. During the follow-up field tests, performed three months after the TAC system installation, measurements were repeated under three different room temperature setpoint conditions (normal, set-up, and set-down) to investigate the ability of the occupants to use the desktop TAC units to control their local environment in response to a wider range of ambient temperatures. Survey results show that among the six building assessment categories investigated, installation of the desktop TAC system provided the largest increases in overall occupant satisfaction for thermal quality, acoustical quality, and air quality. In terms of specific environmental factors, increased occupant satisfaction levels among the TAC group were strongly significant in comparison to changes within the control group for both temperature and temperature control. A large majority of the workers in the control group indicated a preference for higher air movement at <b>operative</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 73 °F (23 °C) and above. The percentage preferring higher air movement within the TAC group was significantly lower.

50|$|To {{obtain the}} most {{accurate}} results possible {{it is necessary to}} calibrate the internal temperature sensors of the thermal manikin. A good calibration will use at least 2 temperature set points minimum 10 °C apart from one another. The manikin is set up in a thermally controlled environmental chamber so that the temperature of all its segments will be nearly identical to the <b>operative</b> <b>temperature</b> of the chamber. This means that the manikin must be unclothed and with minimal insulation between any body part and the air. A good system to achieve this is to have the manikin seated in an open chair (allowing air movement to pass through), with its feet propped up off the ground. Fans should be used to increase air movement in the chamber, ensuring constant mixing. This is acceptable for maintaining a constant temperature as there is no evaporative cooling without sweating or condensation (humidity should be low to ensure no condensation occurs). At each temperature set point the manikin will need to remain in the room for 3 to 6 hours in order to come to steady state conditions.

5000|$|Calcium Nitrite has a {{great variety}} of uses. It can be use as {{antifreeze}} due to its high solubility, either in solution or powder. It can promote the hydration of minerals in cement using this antifreeze at sub freezing temperature, the <b>operative</b> <b>temperature</b> can be reduced to −20 °C. It also work as metal corrosion inhibitor, so it can protect steel in concrete buildings and structures from rust, to extend life of specific buildings. Nitrite's success as a corrosion inhibitor for the protection of embedded steel in reinforced concrete comes from the [...] "smart" [...] behavior of the AFm phase (AFm is shorthand for a family of hydrated calcium aluminate hydrate phases: aluminate-ferrite-monosubstituent phases); normally it stores nitrite in preference to sulfate, carbonate, and hydroxyl ions so that the nitrite concentrations of pore fluid are low. However if chloride ingress occurs in service (from sea water or de-icing salt), the AFm undergoes ion exchange, gaining chloride and forming Friedel's salt (Cl-AFm), while releasing soluble nitrite ions to the pore fluid. As a result, the aqueous ratio of NO2−/Cl− increases which assures corrosion inhibition of embedded steel. [...] Also it is used as a heavy oil detergent and in pharmaceuticals, dyes and metallurgy industries.|$|E

40|$|New {{climate change}} {{projections}} for the UK were {{published by the}} United Kingdom Climate Impacts Programme in 2009. They form the 5 th and most comprehensive set of predictions of climate change developed for the UK to date. As one of main products of UK Climate Projections 2009 (UKCP 09), the Weather Generator, can generate a set of daily and hourly future weather variables at different time periods (2020 s to 2080 s) and carbon emission scenarios (low, medium and high) on a 5 km grid scale. In {{a radical departure from}} previous methods, the 2009 Projections are statistical-probabilistic in nature. A tool has been developed in Matlab to generate future Test Reference Year (TRY) and Design Reference Years (DRY) weather files from these Projections and the results were verified against results from alternative tools produced by Manchester University and Exeter University as well as with CIBSE’s Future Weather Years (FWYs) which are based on earlier (4 th generation) climate change scenarios and are currently used by practitioners. The Northumbria tool is computationally efficient and can extract a single Test Reference Year and 2 Design Reference Years from 3000 years of raw data in less than 6 minutes on a typical modern PC. It uses an established ISO method for generating Test Reference Year data and an alternative method of constructing future Design Reference Years data is proposed. Fifteen different buildings have been identified according to alternative usage, thermal insulation, user activity and construction details. Besides these variants, the buildings were chosen specifically because they either exist, or have received planning consent and so represent ‘real’ UK building examples. Two investigations were then carried out based on the 15 case study buildings. The first involved applying TRYs generated for London, Manchester and Edinburgh for a variety of carbon emission scenarios at time horizons of 2030, 2050 and 2080. The TRYs were developed into a weather data format readable by the EnergyPlus energy simulation program to simulate summertime internal comfort (<b>operative)</b> <b>temperatures,</b> cooling demands and winter heating demands. All results were compared with a control data set of nominally current weather data, together with the same results produced using the alternative weather data generators of Manchester University, Exeter University and the CIBSE FWYs. Results revealed a good agreement between the various methods and show that significant increases in internal summer <b>operative</b> <b>temperatures</b> in non-air-conditioned buildings can be expected as time advances through this century, as well as increased air conditioning cooling energy demands and small reductions in winter heating energy demand. The second investigation involved generating time series of design internal peak summertime <b>operative</b> <b>temperatures,</b> design cooling demands and design winter heating demands for the same conditions as the first investigation. The results were then used to develop a simplified estimation method to predict future design cooling loads using multiple regressions fitting to selected data from the DRY simulation inputs and outputs. The simplified estimation method forms a useful tool for estimating how future cooling design loads in buildings are likely to evolve over time. It also provides a basis for designers and practitioners to determine how buildings constructed today will need to be adapted through life to cope with climate change...|$|R
