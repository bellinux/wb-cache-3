"Every Breath You Take," [...] {{which begins}} side {{two of the}} record, is {{possibly}} The Police's best-known song, with Sting's vocals on top <b>of</b> a <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm</b> featuring picked guitar, strong bass, and controlled drumming. Originally, the song was what Summers called a [...] "Hammond organ thing that sounded like Billy Preston." [...] The guitarist {{came up with a}} more interesting guitar riff which became a distinctive part of the piece. The song, released before the album, went to number 1 on both the US and UK charts, aided by a black and white video directed by Godley & Creme.|$|R
40|$|Movements and {{behavior}} synchronize during social interaction at many levels, often unintentionally. During smooth conversation, for example, participants adapt to each others' speech rates. Here we aimed {{to find out}} to which extent speakers adapt their turn-taking rhythms during a story-building game. Nine sex-matched dyads of adults (12 males, 6 females) created two 5 -min stories by contributing to them alternatingly one word at a time. The participants were located in different rooms, with audio connection during one story and audiovisual during the other. They were free to select {{the topic of the}} story. Although the participants received no instructions regarding the timing of the story building, their word rhythms were highly entrained (øverlineR = 0. 70, p < 0. 001) even though the rhythms as such were unstable (øverlineR = 0. 14 for pooled data). Such high entrainment in the absence <b>of</b> <b>steady</b> word <b>rhythm</b> occurred in every individual story, independently of whether the subjects were connected via audio-onlyor audiovisual link. The observed entrainment was of similar strength as typical entrainment in finger-tapping tasks where participants are specifically instructed to synchronize their behavior. Thus, speech seems to spontaneously induce strong entrainment between the conversation partners, likely reflecting automatic alignment of their semantic and syntactic processes. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Music with a steady 4/4 beat is thought to work best due to the predictability of the beat.|$|R

50|$|Carman's musical {{abilities}} {{were rather}} limited, consisting of simple single-note runs repeated with little {{attention given to}} a <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm</b> or conventional time keeping. Carman's sloppiness was made worse by his heavy drinking and he often {{did not bother to}} tune his guitar. His singing voice was similarly ragged, having a nasal twang and limited range. In spite of his musical limitations Carman remained popular with audiences due to his distinctive sound, easy going charm and humor.|$|R
50|$|An {{individual}} with this condition has an especially difficult time maintaining a steady beat, and even has difficulty following along to a <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm.</b> Before {{it was a}} known disorder, {{it was thought that}} these individuals were just severely uncoordinated, and therefore were unable to follow along with the music. It has been discovered recently that problems with rhythm in Schizophrenia, Parkinson's, and Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder are also found to have a correlation to rhythm deficiencies.|$|R

The mower takes a small step forward and repeats the motion, proceeding with a <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm,</b> stopping at frequent intervals to hone the blade. The correct technique has a slicing action on the grass, cutting a narrow strip, leaving a uniform stubble on the ground and forming a regular windrow on the left.|$|R

50|$|This {{composition}} {{is in one}} movement and takes three minutes to perform. It is scored for a normal SATB mixed choir, but it requires SAATBB in some segments.

The composition has a <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm,</b> marked Andante moderato (♩ = 88), and only changes its tempo towards the end, to a Meno mosso (♩ = 68) (Andante poco sostenuto).|$|R

"Heroin" [...] begins {{slowly with}} Reed's quiet, melodic guitar, Sterling Morrison's <b>steady</b> <b>rhythm</b> guitar and {{hypnotic}} drum patterns by Maureen Tucker, soon joined by John Cale's droning electric viola. The tempo increases gradually, mimicking the high the narrator receives from the drug, until a frantic crescendo is reached, punctuated by Cale's shrieking viola {{and the more}} punctuated guitar strumming of Reed and Morrison. Tucker's drumming becomes hurried and louder. The song then slows to the original tempo, and repeats the same pattern before ending.|$|R
