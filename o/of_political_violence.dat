Subsequently, in August 1992, FUNCINPEC formally registered {{itself as a}} political party under the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) administration, and started opening party offices across Cambodia the following month. However, party offices and officials faced harassment and attacks from State of Cambodia (SOC) secret police and military intelligence officials. Between November 1992 and January 1993, 18 FUNCINPEC officials were killed and another 22 officials wounded, prompting Ranariddh to call on UNTAC to intervene and end the violence. UNTAC responded by setting up a special prosecutor's office to investigate cases <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>violence,</b> but faced resistance from the SOC police in arresting and prosecuting offenders. Most of the violent attacks occurred in the Kampong Cham and Battambang provinces, whereby the governor in the latter province, Ung Sami {{was found to have}} been directly involved in the attacks. When UNTAC allowed election campaigns to start in April 1993, FUNCINPEC held few election rallies due to intimidations from SOC police. They campaigned through low-key methods, such as using pick-up trucks to travel around the country and broadcast political messages as well as sending party workers to visit villages in the countryside.|$|E

25|$|In 1914, {{after nearly}} three decades of agitation, Ireland seemed {{on the brink of}} Home Rule (or self-government), however, instead of a {{peaceful}} handover from direct British rule to limited Irish autonomy, Ireland and Dublin saw nearly ten years <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>violence</b> and instability that eventually resulted in a much more complete break with Britain than Home Rule would have represented. By 1923, Dublin was the capital of the Irish Free State, an all but independent Irish state, governing 26 of Ireland's 32 counties.|$|E

25|$|Bacaloglu lived most of {{her later}} life in the Kingdom of Italy, where she {{affiliated}} with the literary and political circles. Her subsequent work included campaigns for Pan-Latinism and Romanian irredentism. This second career peaked upon the close of World War I, when Bacaloglu became involved with Italian fascism. Introduced to Benito Mussolini and Benedetto Croce, she helped transplant fascism on Romanian soil. Her National Italo-Romanian Cultural and Economic Movement was a minor and heterodox political party, but managed to earn attention with its advocacy <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>violence.</b>|$|E

Sinn Féin had accepted the Mitchell Principles, which involved commitment to non-violence, in September 1997 as part of the peace process negotiations. Dissident members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA), who saw this as a betrayal of the republican struggle for a united Ireland, left to form the Real Irish Republican Army (RIRA) in October 1997.|$|E
25|$|In the South Carolina gubernatorial {{election}} of 1840, Wigfall actively supported the candidacy of John Peter Richardson over {{the more radical}} James Henry Hammond, which led to public exchanges of arguments and insults. In a five-month period, Wigfall managed {{to get into a}} fistfight, two duels, three near-duels, and was charged, but not indicted, for killing a man. This outbreak <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>violence</b> culminated in 1840 on an island in the Savannah River near Augusta, Georgia, where Wigfall took a bullet through both thighs while dueling with future Congressman Preston Brooks. Although Hammond lost the race for Governor, he attempted to mediate the dispute between the two hot-headed young men. Wigfall received an aide-de-camp and Lieutenant Colonelcy on Governor Richardson's staff, but never was completely satisfied with the outcome of the Brooks affair.|$|E

25|$|He {{returned}} to Germany in 1919 {{to complete his}} law studies at the University of Jena, and qualified as a Doctor of Law in 1922. From 1924 {{he worked as a}} solicitor in Kassel. He was also elected a city councillor {{as a member of the}} Völkisch-Sozialer Block ("People's Social Block"), an extreme nationalist splinter party. Freisler joined the National Socialist German Workers' Party in July 1925 as Member #9679. and gained authority immediately within the organisation by using his legal training to defend members of it who were regularly facing prosecutions for acts <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>violence.</b> As the Party transitioned from a fringe political beer-hall and street fighting movement into a political one, Freisler was elected for it to the Prussian Landtag, and later he became a Member of the Reichstag.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>violence</b> {{came from}} the anarchist movement of the 1890s. The first attack was organized by an anarchist named Ravachol, who set off bombs at three residences of wealthy Parisians. On April 25, he set off a bomb at the Restaurant Véry at the Palais-Royal and was arrested. On 8 November, anarchists planted a bomb {{in the office of}} the Compagnie Minière et Métallurgique, a mining company, on the Avenue de l'Opéra. The police found the bomb, but when it was taken to the police headquarters, it exploded, killing six persons. On 6 December, an anarchist named Auguste Vaillant set off a bomb in the building of the National Assembly that wounded forty-six persons. On 12 February 1894, an anarchist named Émile Henry set off a bomb at the café of the Hôtel Terminus next to the Gare Saint-Lazare that killed one person and wounded seventy-nine.|$|E
25|$|These basic {{political}} views and principles {{formed the basis}} of Mussolini's newly formed political movement, the Fasci Rivoluzionari d'Azione Internazionalista in 1914, who called themselves Fascisti (Fascists). At this time, the Fascists did not have an integrated set of policies and the movement was small, ineffective in its attempts to hold mass meetings, and was regularly harassed by government authorities and orthodox socialists. Antagonism between the interventionists, including the Fascists, versus the anti-interventionist orthodox socialists resulted in violence between the Fascists and socialists. The opposition and attacks by the anti-interventionist revolutionary socialists against the Fascists and other interventionists were so violent that even democratic socialists who opposed the war such as Anna Kuliscioff said that the Italian Socialist Party had gone too far in a campaign of silencing the freedom of speech of supporters of the war. These early hostilities between the Fascists and the revolutionary socialists shaped Mussolini's conception of the nature of Fascism in its support <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>violence.</b>|$|E

Oriented toward theory building, Della Porta develops her own definition <b>of</b> clandestine <b>political</b> <b>violence.</b> Building {{on the most}} recent developments in social movement studies, Della Porta proposes an original interpretative model. Using a unique research design, she singles out some common causal mechanisms at the onset, during the persistence and at the demise <b>of</b> clandestine <b>political</b> <b>violence.</b> The development <b>of</b> the phenomenon is located within the interactions among social movements, countermovements and the state. She pays {{particular attention to the}} ways different actors cognitively construct the reality they act upon.

25|$|Since {{at least}} the 1600s, all of these areas have been {{connected}} politically, reaching a height in 1801 {{with the creation of}} the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. About five-sixths of the island of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom in 1921 as the Irish Free State. Historically, relations between the two states have been influenced heavily by issues arising from their shared (and frequently troubled) history, the independence of the Irish Free State and the governance of Northern Ireland. These include the partition of Ireland and the terms of Ireland's secession, its constitutional relationship with and obligations to the UK after independence, and the outbreak <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>violence</b> in Northern Ireland. Additionally, the high level of trade between the two states, their proximate geographic location, their common status as islands in the European Union, common language and close cultural and personal links mean political developments in both states often closely follow each other.|$|E
25|$|Annan {{serves as}} Chair of The Elders, {{a group of}} {{independent}} global leaders who work together on peace and human rights issues. In November 2008, Annan and fellow Elders Jimmy Carter and Graça Machel attempted to travel to Zimbabwe to make a first-hand assessment of the humanitarian situation in the country. Refused entry, the Elders instead carried out their assessment from Johannesburg, where they met Zimbabwe- and South Africa-based leaders from politics, business, international organisations and civil society. In May 2011, following months <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>violence</b> in Côte d'Ivoire, Annan travelled to the country with Elders Desmond Tutu and Mary Robinson to encourage national reconciliation. On 16 October 2014, Kofi Annan attended the One Young World Summit in Dublin. During a session with fellow Elder Mary Robinson, Kofi Annan encouraged 1,300 young leaders from 191 countries to lead on intergenerational issues such as climate change {{and the need for}} action to take place now, not tomorrow. During the Summit he told leaders from 191 countries that addressing the effects of climate change was a general issue, for both the young and old.|$|E
25|$|The gens Annia, {{to which}} Marcus belonged, had an undistinguished history. Their only famous member was Titus Annius Milo, a man known for hastening {{the end of}} the free {{republic}} through his use <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>violence.</b> Marcus Aurelius' family originated in Ucubi, a small town southeast of Córdoba in Iberian Baetica. The family rose to prominence in the late first century AD. Marcus' great-grandfather Marcus Annius Verus (I) was a senator and (according to the Historia Augusta) ex-praetor; in 73–74 his grandfather Marcus Annius Verus (II) was made a patrician. Cassius Dio asserts that the Annii were near-kin of Hadrian, and that it was to these familial ties that they owed their rise to power. The precise nature of these kinship ties is nowhere stated. One conjectural bond runs through Annius Verus (II). Verus' wife Rupilia Faustina was the daughter of the consular senator Libo Rupilius Frugi and an unnamed mother. It has been hypothesized Rupilia Faustina's mother was Matidia, who was also the mother (presumably through another marriage) of Vibia Sabina, Hadrian's wife. Verus' elder son—Marcus Aurelius' father—Marcus Annius Verus (III) married Domitia Lucilla.|$|E
