5|$|Eruptions {{would likely}} {{continue}} {{for a period}} of time, followed by years of decreasing secondary activity. The solidifying lava would occasionally collapse portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> to create pyroclastic flows. Rubble on the flanks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> and in valleys would occasionally be released to form debris flows. Major construction would be needed to repair the community of Squamish and Highway 99.|$|E
5|$|The bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> {{was formed}} in the Quaternary, with {{activity}} commencing in the Miocene. Five million years ago, the first latiandesites were erupted. The minor eruptive centres of Pumaranra and Antapuna are K-Ar dated at 1.3 ± 0.11 and 1.02 ± 0.11 million years old. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> was constructed by lava flows.|$|E
5|$|The first {{foreigner}} {{to arrive}} at Hawaii was James Cook in 1778. The first non-native to observe Kīlauea in detail was William Ellis, an English missionary who in 1823 spent {{more than two weeks}} trekking across the volcano. He collated the first written account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> and observed many of its features, establishing the premise for future explorations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>volcano.</b>|$|E
500|$|Lava {{attributed}} to a shield-stage Hualālai has been found just offshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>volcano's</b> northwest rift zone.

5|$|Beginning November 1984, geologists {{observed}} {{an increasing}} level of seismic activity near Nevado del Ruiz. Other {{signs of a}} forthcoming eruption included increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on the summit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>volcano,</b> and small phreatic eruptions. In the latter, hot magma {{came in contact with}} water, resulting in explosions as the water was almost instantly turned into steam. The most notable of these events was an ash ejection on September 11, 1985. The activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> decreased in October 1985. The most likely explanation of the events is that new magma rose into the volcanic edifice before September 1985.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the eruption, {{scientists}} {{established a}} grid of benchmarks against which they measured the change {{in the shape of the}} island. In the 20years following {{the end of the}} eruption, measurements revealed that the island was steadily subsiding and had lost about one metre in height. The rate of subsidence was initially about 20cm (8in) per year but slowed to 1–2cm (0.4–0.8in) a year by the 1990s. It had several causes: settling of the loose tephra forming the bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>volcano,</b> compaction of sea floor sediments underlying the island, and downward warping of the lithosphere due to the weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>volcano.</b>|$|E

25|$|In September 1928, Mount Fee {{was named}} by British mountaineer Tom Fyles after Charles Fee (1865–1927), {{who was a}} member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Columbia Mountaineering Club in Vancouver at the time. Subsequently, Mount Fee was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>volcanoes</b> in <b>the</b> Mount Cayley {{volcanic}} field illustrated by volcanologist Jack Souther in 1980. Others included Cauldron Dome, Mount Cayley, Slag Hill, Ember Ridge and Ring Mountain, which was titled Crucible Dome at the time.

5|$|The {{most recent}} {{evidence}} of volcanic activity at Mount Hood consists of fumaroles near Crater Rock and hot springs on the flanks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>volcano.</b>|$|E
5|$|The summit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> has {{steep slopes}} inclining from 20 to 30 degrees. At lower elevations, the slopes become less steep; their {{inclination}} is about 10 degrees. From there on, foothills stretch {{almost to the}} edge of the Magdalena River, north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> and the Cauca River to the west. On the two major sides of the summit, headwalls show where past rock avalanches occurred. At times, ice on the summit has melted, generating devastating lahars, including the continent's deadliest eruption in 1985. On the volcano's southwest flank is the pyroclastic cone La Olleta, which is not currently active, but may have erupted in historical times.|$|E
5|$|Hekla in Iceland, {{an example}} of basaltic Plinian {{volcanism}} being its 1947–48 eruption. The past 800 years have been a pattern of violent initial eruptions of pumice followed by prolonged extrusion of basaltic lava from the lower part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>volcano.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>volcano's</b> remote location, much {{information}} on its activity comes from remote sensing. In addition, occasional reconnaissance flights, seismographic monitoring, and infrequent visits to <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> occur. <b>The</b> Observatorio Volcanológico de los Andes del Sur in Temuco also employs webcams to watch Lascar.|$|R

5|$|Licancabur {{has been}} active during the Holocene, after the ice ages. Although no {{historic}} eruptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> are known, lava flows extending into Laguna Verde have been dated to 13,240 ± 100 BP. The volcano has primarily erupted andesite, with small amounts of dacite and basaltic andesite.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Loa's {{most recent}} {{eruption}} occurred from March24 to April15, 1984. No recent eruptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> have caused fatalities, but eruptions in 1926 and 1950 destroyed villages, {{and the city}} of Hilo is partly built on lava flows from the late 19th century. Because of the potential hazards it poses to population centers, Mauna Loa is part of the Decade Volcanoes program, which encourages studies of the world's most dangerous volcanoes. Mauna Loa has been monitored intensively by the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory since 1912. Observations of the atmosphere are undertaken at the Mauna Loa Observatory, and of the Sun at the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory, both located near the mountain's summit. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park covers the summit and the southeastern flank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>volcano,</b> and also incorporates Kīlauea, a separate volcano.|$|E
5|$|Monitoring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> and {{predictions}} of large eruptions {{are particularly important}} because of its location in a densely populated area, {{with the city of}} Kagoshima's 680,000 residents just a few kilometers from the volcano. The city conducts regular evacuation drills, and a number of shelters have been built where people can take refuge from falling volcanic debris.|$|E
50|$|Although {{volcanism}} {{and erosion}} are the chief {{factors in the}} growth and erosion of a volcano, other factors are also involved. Subsidence is known to occur. Changes in sea level, occurring mostly during the Pleistocene, have caused drastic changes; an example is <b>the</b> breakup <b>of</b> Maui Nui, initially a seven-volcano island, which was transformed into five islands {{as a result of}} subsidence. High rainfall due to the trade wind effect impacts on <b>the</b> severity <b>of</b> erosion on many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major <b>volcanoes.</b> Coastline collapses, a notable part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hawaiian <b>volcanoes,</b> are often devastating and destroy large parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>volcanoes.</b>|$|R

5|$|Ancient Hawaiians {{were the}} first to {{recognize}} the increasing age and weathered state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>volcanoes</b> to <b>the</b> north as they progressed on fishing expeditions along the islands. <b>The</b> volatile state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hawaiian <b>volcanoes</b> and their constant battle with the sea was a major element in Hawaiian mythology, embodied in Pele, <b>the</b> deity <b>of</b> <b>volcanoes.</b> After <b>the</b> arrival <b>of</b> Europeans on <b>the</b> island, in 1880–1881 James Dwight Dana directed the first formal geological study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hotspot's volcanics, confirming the relationship long observed by the natives. 1912 marked <b>the</b> founding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hawaiian <b>Volcano</b> Observatory by volcanologist Thomas Jaggar, initiating continuous scientific observation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> islands. In the 1970s, a mapping project was initiated to gain more information about <b>the</b> complex geology <b>of</b> Hawaii's seafloor.|$|R
5|$|Sulfur {{deposits}} {{generated from}} hydrothermal alteration are found on Cerro Tuzgle.
