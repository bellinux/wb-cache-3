5|$|Seeds are {{the primary}} way that trees {{reproduce}} and their seeds vary greatly in size and shape. Some of the largest seeds come from trees, but the largest tree, Sequoiadendron giganteum, produces <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> tree seeds. The great diversity in tree fruits and seeds reflects the many different ways that tree species have evolved to disperse their offspring.|$|E
5|$|The station {{opened in}} 1899 as the London {{terminus}} of the Great Central Main Line (GCML), {{the last major}} railway to open in Britain in over 100 years, linking the capital to the cities of Nottingham, Sheffield and Manchester. Marylebone {{was the last of}} London's main line termini to be built, and is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest,</b> having opened with half the number of platforms originally planned. It has limited connections to the Underground as it was built after the main Tube lines in the area.|$|E

5|$|The {{vegetation}} in the atoll is sparse, {{because of}} the lack of fresh water. Only two species of vascular plant are currently known to grow there <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> such floras on any island. Acadia, Pandora and Edwards Islets are forested with Heliotropium foertherianum, but Westward Islet is not. Pemphis acidula has also been recorded on Ducie; specimens were found during an expedition in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Upper Pine Bottom State Park is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> {{state parks}} in Pennsylvania, and is {{maintained}} by staff from nearby Little Pine State Park. In addition to picnics, its chief use is as a parking area for local hunters, anglers, hikers, cross-country skiers, snowmobilers, and all-terrain vehicle riders. Upper Pine Bottom Run is state-approved and stocked for trout fishing in season. Second-growth forest now covers the region; the surrounding state forest and park {{are home to}} a variety of flora and fauna.|$|E
5|$|A {{considerable}} amount of new knowledge about plant function comes from studies of the molecular genetics of model plants such as the Thale cress, Arabidopsis thaliana, a weedy species in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). The genome or hereditary information contained in the genes of this species is encoded by about 135 million base pairs of DNA, forming <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> genomes among flowering plants. Arabidopsis was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, in 2000. The sequencing of some other relatively small genomes, of rice (Oryza sativa) and Brachypodium distachyon, has made them important model species for understanding the genetics, cellular and molecular biology of cereals, grasses and monocots generally.|$|E

5|$|Always <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> {{children}} {{in his class}} and without stable supervision at home, Fleury adopted an aggressive posture and later {{described himself as a}} bully. He turned to hockey as an outlet when he borrowed an old pair of skates and a broken stick to play his first game at the age of five. From that point on, he played hockey at every opportunity, often accompanying his father to the arena in Russell in the pre-dawn hours. He was described by his teachers as a determined youth, who would repeat any activity he failed at until he got it right.|$|E
5|$|Barbeyella minutissima is a slime mould {{species of}} the order Echinosteliales, and the only {{species of the}} genus Barbeyella. First {{described}} in 1914 from the Jura mountains, its habitat is restricted to montane spruce and spruce-fir forests of the Northern Hemisphere, {{where it has been}} recorded from Asia, Europe, and North America. It typically colonises slimy, algae-covered logs that have lost their bark and have been partially to completely covered by liverworts. The sporangia are roughly spherical, up to 0.2mm in diameter, and supported by a thin stalk up to 0.7mm tall. After the spores have developed, the walls of the sporangia split open into lobes. The species is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> members of the Myxogastria and is considered rare.|$|E
5|$|During this time, the Flames {{found it}} {{increasingly}} difficult to retain their best players as salaries escalated while the Canadian dollar lost value against the American dollar. Calgary has always been <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> markets in the league (it is currently third-smallest, behind only Edmonton and Winnipeg) and the NHL's small-market Canadian teams found {{it increasingly difficult}} to compete in the new environment. In 1999, for example, the Flames traded Fleury to the Colorado Avalanche midway through the season. The trade came shortly after Fleury became the franchise's all-time leading scorer. Fleury was due to become an unrestricted free agent {{at the end of the}} season, and the Flames did not want to risk losing him without getting anything in return.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, Clement Attlee, the Labour Prime Minister, {{called a}} general election. Dunglass {{was invited to}} stand once again as Unionist {{candidate}} for Lanark. Having been disgusted at personal attacks during the 1945 campaign by Tom Steele, his Labour opponent, Dunglass did not scruple to remind the voters of Lanark that Steele had warmly thanked the Communist Party and its members for helping him take the seat from the Unionists. By 1950, with the Cold War at its height, Steele's association with the communists was a crucial electoral liability. Dunglass regained the seat with <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> majorities in any British constituency: 19,890 to Labour's 19,205. Labour narrowly won the general election, with a majority of 5.|$|E
5|$|Mura {{also has}} support during their matches from their ultras group, named the Black Gringos. Statistically, both teams always enjoyed {{one of the}} biggest attendances on their matches and, in term of numbers, both teams had one of the largest fan bases in the country. The fact that Prekmurje is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> and least {{populated}} regions in Slovenia has made Mura's fans labeled, by the general public, {{as one of the most}} loyal in the country. Statistically, Maribor is the more successful club, considering either the case of matches from the period from 1967 to 2005, or the whole period from 1967 to present day.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland has an {{overwhelmingly}} private sector economy and low tax rates by Western World standards; overall taxation is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> of developed countries. Switzerland {{is a relatively}} easy place to do business, currently ranking 20th of 189 countries in the Ease of Doing Business Index. The slow growth Switzerland experienced in the 1990s and the early 2000s has brought greater support for economic reforms and harmonisation with the European Union. According to Credit Suisse, only about 37% of residents own their own homes, {{one of the lowest}} rates of home ownership in Europe. Housing and food price levels were 171% and 145% of the EU-25 index in 2007, compared to 113% and 104% in Germany.|$|E

5|$|The Shetland is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> British breeds. The ewes {{are usually}} polled (hornless) and the rams usually horned, {{although}} horned ewes and polled rams do occur occasionally. The breed is {{noted for its}} very fine, soft wool and the high quality of its meat, though its smaller size limits its use in commercial meat markets. They are small-bodied animals, with some wool on their faces, noses or legs, but not in excess. The legs are of medium length and finely boned. They have small, erect ears. A distinguishing feature of northern short-tailed sheep is the short, fluke-shaped tail, broad at the base, tapering to a point, and covered towards the tip in hair, not wool.|$|E
5|$|The Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero or Virgin Islands dwarf gecko (Sphaerodactylus parthenopion) is {{a species}} of gecko and also <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> {{terrestrial}} vertebrates. It has only been found on three of the British Virgin Islands: Virgin Gorda, Tortola, and Moskito Island (also spelled “Mosquito Island”). It was discovered in 1964 and is suspected to be a close relative of Sphaerodactylus nicholsi, a dwarf sphaero from the nearby island of Puerto Rico. It shares its range with the big-scaled least gecko (S.macrolepis), which is found in leaf litter. Unlike this larger gecko, the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero lives on drier hillsides, yet prefers moist microhabitats found under rocks because it lacks the adaptations necessary for preventing water loss, which is a significant problem due to its small body size.|$|E
5|$|The meat, blubber, baleen, and oil of baleen whales have {{traditionally}} {{been used by the}} indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Once relentlessly hunted by commercial industries for these products, cetaceans are now protected by international law. However, the North Atlantic right whale is ranked critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Besides hunting, baleen whales also face threats from marine pollution and ocean acidification. It has been speculated that man-made sonar results in strandings. They have rarely been kept in captivity, and this has only been attempted with juveniles or members of <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> species.|$|E

5|$|The {{station is}} one of the most {{recently}} built coal-fired power stations in the United Kingdom, but with a generating capacity of only 420megawatts (MW), is now <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> operating. Two separate wind farm plans currently have permission to be built near the station, one for a 13 turbine wind farm near the smelter and another three turbine wind farm to the north of the station. In 2009, Alcan announced that they hope to fit the station with carbon capture and storage technology. In 2011, it was announced that the power station may be converted to burn biomass only, in a bid to avoid government legislation. In January 2016 the station was purchased by Energetický a průmyslový holding (EPH).|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> {{players of}} his generation, Fleury played a {{physical}} style that often led to altercations. As a junior, {{he was at}} the centre of the infamous Punch-up in Piestany, a brawl that resulted in the disqualification of both Canada and the Soviet Union from the 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Once considered unlikely to play in the NHL due to his small size, Fleury scored over 1,000 points in his career and won the Stanley Cup in 1989 with the Flames. He twice represented Canada at the Winter Olympics, winning a gold medal in 2002. Throughout his career, he battled drug and alcohol addictions that ultimately forced him out of the NHL in 2003. He played one season in the British Elite Ice Hockey League in 2005–06, and made two attempts to win the Allan Cup. After an unsuccessful NHL comeback attempt with the Flames, he retired in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The first {{buildings}} were {{completed in the}} Gothic style, including the church. The refectory (dining hall) shows an architectural style in transition between earlier Romanesque and contemporary Gothic. A fine High Gothic chapter house was built of best quality hard limestone. The church was rebuilt sometime before 1650 in a late Gothic style with a prominent vaulted ceiling. The cloister was rebuilt around 1617, and is of a simple design with little adornment surrounding a High Renaissance arcade. The final phase of building took place around 1650, with a new doorway for the church, completed in late Renaissance and Plateresque style full of detail. Because of its prosperity and the multiple expansion projects, Santa María de Óvila exhibited examples of every Spanish religious architectural style used from 1200 to 1600. However, even at its height, Óvila remained <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> Cistercian monasteries {{in the region of}} Castile.|$|E
