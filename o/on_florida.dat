5|$|American {{alligator}} predation <b>on</b> <b>Florida</b> panthers is rare, but {{has been}} documented. Such incidents usually involve a panther trying to cross a waterway or coming down to a swamp or river to get a drink. The American alligator is the only known natural predator of the panther. American alligator predation on black bears has also been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Bonnie {{was a small}} {{tropical}} storm that made landfall <b>on</b> <b>Florida</b> in August 2004. The second storm of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, Bonnie developed from a tropical wave on August 3 {{to the east of}} the Lesser Antilles. After moving through the islands, its fast forward motion caused it to dissipate. However, it later regenerated into a {{tropical storm}} near the Yucatán Peninsula. Bonnie attained peak winds of 65mph (100km/h) over the Gulf of Mexico, turned to the northeast, and hit Florida as a 45mph (75km/h) tropical storm. The storm accelerated to the northeast and became an extratropical cyclone to the east of New Jersey. Bonnie was the first of five tropical systems to make landfall <b>on</b> <b>Florida</b> in the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, and the second of a record eight disturbances to reach tropical storm strength during the month of August.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Gabrielle {{originated}} {{in a weak}} low- to mid-level trough that was nearly stationary a short distance off the southeastern coastline of the United States. A cut off low formed over Florida on September 9, and an associated surface low pressure system formed, that was soon designated Tropical Depression Eight. The storm gradually intensified, and made landfall <b>on</b> <b>Florida</b> before emerging into the Atlantic Ocean and accelerating northeastward, as it reached peak intensity as a minimal hurricane.|$|E

In total, Virginia Tech had 179rushing yards; three players had more rushing yards than the leading rusher <b>on</b> <b>Florida</b> State, running back Ty Jones, who had 24yards. Jones also had three rushing touchdowns, {{becoming}} the first Florida State player to rush for three touchdowns since Oct. 4, 2008. He also was the second player ever to rush for three touchdowns in an ACC Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|A high {{pressure}} system over the central United States drifted east {{and added a}} westward component to Gordon's southward motion, pulling the storm southwest towards Florida. The persistent shear and a continued lack of deep convection eventually reduced the storm's winds to below tropical storm force, and on the morning on November 20 Gordon became a tropical depression. The {{high pressure}} system over the continent continued pulling the depression towards the west until it made its final landfall near Cape Canaveral that night with winds of 30 mph (45 km/h). Between its three Floridian landfalls, Hurricane Gordon dumped 5–10 in (13–25 cm) of rain <b>on</b> <b>Florida,</b> with a station at Cooperstown recording 16.1 in (40.9 cm). The storm moved northward across Florida, northeastward across Georgia, and finally merged with a frontal system over South Carolina.|$|E

5|$|After {{moderate}} beach erosion {{from previous}} hurricanes Dennis and Floyd, Irene caused significant beach erosion {{on the eastern}} Florida coastline. The erosion exposed the foundations of private homes, leaving some uninhabitable. Beach erosion damage totalled to $21million. Many beach access points were closed until more sand could be pumped in, or until the stairways were rebuilt. Strong north winds and high seas severely destroyed or damaged docks in the Indian River Lagoon. Heavy rainfall, ranging from 5 to 9inches (127 to 229mm) in Martin and St. Lucie Counties flooded 260homes. Strong wind gusts from 60 to 70mph (97 to 113km/h) severely damaged 34houses and caused light damage to 1,114homes in Martin, St. Lucie, and Brevard Counties. In addition the winds damaged 465mobilehomes, 15severely, and destroyed one. 555commercial buildings also experienced light damage, and gusty winds downed about 1,000trees. Rough seas broke a large barge free from its mooring into a bridge <b>on</b> <b>Florida</b> Highway 528. In Flagler County, the hurricane caused severe damage to four homes, and minor damage to 173houses and 18businesses. Damage in northeastern Florida totaled to $51million.|$|E
5|$|Because {{little was}} known about the region, the {{elements}} of its climate, citrus, water, and general ideas about illness and health, Stowe was possibly first among several authors and advertising schemes that portrayed Florida as an exotic place of natural wonders and powers that could rejuvenate frail health. What travel writers published <b>on</b> <b>Florida</b> were exaggerated claims, readily accepted by audiences hungry for escapist literature. Biographer Forrest Wilson considers the finished product, Palmetto Leaves—published in 1873—to be the first promotional writing about Florida ever. Occasionally letters about the state were printed in local newspapers in the North, but because Florida was {{still very much a}} rugged wilderness, Northerners really had no concept of what the region was like. Rather besotted with the marvelous properties she saw in the orange, Stowe intended to call the book Orange Blossoms, but changed the title to better express the plant that proliferated the region the most.|$|E
5|$|Initially, forecasters {{predicted}} Irene to {{parallel the}} west coast of Florida, weakening to a tropical storm before making landfall on the west-central portion of the state. However, when a more eastward track became evident, officials in Monroe, Charlotte, Lee, and Manatee Counties issued evacuation orders for people in mobile homes and recreational vehicles. In addition, Key West issued a curfew during the storm's onslaught. The National Hurricane Center issued a Hurricane Warning from Florida City around the Florida Peninsula to Boca Grande, including all of the Florida Keys and the Dry Tortugas. A Tropical Storm Warning was also issued from Florida City northward to Savannah, Georgia. In addition, the majority of flights during Irene's passage were cancelled in Miami International Airport. Governor Jeb Bush {{declared a state of emergency}} <b>on</b> <b>Florida</b> the day before Irene made landfall, and ordered for the activation of the Florida National Guard to aid in disaster efforts.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Barry was {{a rapidly}} forming {{tropical}} cyclone that made landfall <b>on</b> <b>Florida,</b> United States, in early June 2007. The second named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season, Barry developed from a trough of low {{pressure in the}} southeastern Gulf of Mexico on June 1. It tracked rapidly northeastward, reaching peak winds of 60mph (95km/h) before weakening and making landfall near Tampa Bay as a tropical depression. Barry quickly lost tropical characteristics after wind shear removed much of the convection, and early on June 3 it completed the transition into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants tracked up the East Coast of the United States, and were absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone on June 5.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Dottie was {{the ninth}} {{tropical}} cyclone and fourth named storm of the 1976 Atlantic hurricane season. The precursor to Dottie {{formed in the}} Gulf of Mexico on August 17 and organized into a tropical depression on August 18. The storm drifted towards the east, and, after peaking as a moderate tropical storm, it accelerated northeastward and made landfall <b>on</b> <b>Florida.</b> Upon re-emerging in the Atlantic, Dottie turned northward and moved ashore near Charleston, South Carolina. Damage from the storm was primarily insignificant and limited to gusty winds, heavy rainfall, and high tides; however, a fishing boat capsized in the Bahamas, resulting {{in the deaths of}} four people.|$|E
