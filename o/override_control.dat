40|$|Before {{reaching}} full autonomy, {{vehicles will}} gradually {{be equipped with}} more and more advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), effectively rendering them semi-autonomous. However, current ADAS technologies seem unable to handle complex traffic situations, notably when dealing with vehicles arriving from the sides, either at intersections or when merging on highways. The high rate of accidents in these settings prove that they constitute difficult driving situations. Moreover, intersections and merging lanes are often the source of important traffic congestion and, sometimes, deadlocks. In this article, we propose a cooperative framework to safely coordinate semi-autonomous vehicles in such settings, removing the risk of collision or deadlocks while remaining compatible with human driving. More specifically, we present a supervised coordination scheme that <b>overrides</b> <b>control</b> inputs from human drivers when they would result in an unsafe or blocked situation. To avoid unnecessary intervention and remain compatible with human driving, overriding only occurs when collisions or deadlocks are imminent. In this case, safe <b>overriding</b> <b>controls</b> are chosen while ensuring they deviate minimally from those originally requested by the drivers. Simulation results based on a realistic physics simulator show that our approach is scalable to real-world scenarios, and computations can be performed in real-time on a standard computer for up to a dozen simultaneous vehicles...|$|R

There {{are two types of}} fraud considered: misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting (e.g. falsification of accounting records) and misstatements arising from misappropriation of assets (e.g. theft of assets or fraudulent expenditures). The standard describes the fraud triangle. Generally, the three ‘fraud triangle’ conditions are present when fraud occurs. First, there is an incentive or pressure that provides a reason to commit fraud. Second, there is an opportunity for fraud to be perpetrated (e.g. absence of controls, ineffective controls, or the ability of management to <b>override</b> <b>controls.)</b> Third, the individuals committing the fraud possess an attitude that enables them to rationalize the fraud.|$|R

40|$|In {{the real}} world there are three types of multivariable control systems. The first one is {{when the number of}} inputs is equal to the number of the outputs, this type of multivariable control system is defined as a squared multivariable control system and the main type of {{controller}} designed is a decoupling controller which minimizes interactions and gives good set-point tracking. The second type of multivariable control system is where the number of inputs is greater than the number of the outputs, for this type of system the main controller designed is a fail-safe controller. This controller remains stable if a sub-set of actuator fail. The third type of multivariable control system is the number of outputs is greater than the number of inputs, for this type of system the main controller designed is an <b>override</b> <b>control</b> system. This controller only controls a sub-set of outputs based on a lowest wins control strategy. All the three types of multivariable control systems are included in this thesis.

Such algorithms evolve solutions using cost functions and optimization. There are a variety of system performance indicators such as integral squared error operator has been used as cost functions to design controllers using such algorithms. The design of both fail-safe and override multivariable controllers is a difficult problem and there are very few analytical design methods for such controllers. Therefore, the main objective of this thesis is to use the genetic algorithms to involve both fail-safe and override controller multivariable controllers, such that they perform well in the time-domain...|$|E

Two main problems are addressed: verification of the safety of all vehicles at an intersection, and management of the inputs of controlled vehicles. For the verification problem, we employ an inserted idle-time scheduling approach, where the “inserted idle-time” is a time interval when the intersection is deliberately held idle for uncontrolled vehicles to safely cross the intersection. For the management problem, we design a supervisor that is least restrictive {{in the sense that it}} <b>overrides</b> <b>controlled</b> vehicles only when a safety violation becomes imminent.

This model is original {{because we do}} not introduce any causality between macroeconomic variables. Instead of postulate macroeconomic properties, we want to understand them by the methodic reconstruction of the conditions of their emergence, starting from their most elementary foundations: the interactions between individual agents. This model is the model of a dynamic out-of-equilibrium economy composed of two principal sets of agents (firms and households) associated with two main functions (production and consumption). The agents are not representative agents or aggregates but autonomous individuals in direct and indirect interactions, each of them pursuing its own purposes, acting according to their individual state and their local environment, without worrying about the general equilibrium of the system and without any <b>overriding</b> <b>control...</b>|$|R

Control of the heating/cooling systems with a stationary thermostat leads to significant vertical air temperature variations between the second and the first floors as well as horizontal temperature variations within a floor.

40|$|Hydraulic pump/motor {{units have}} {{a wide range of}} commer-cial applications, each {{requiring}} a separate bolt-on hydraulic controller. This paper outlines the results of laboratory feasibility tests, aimed at replacing these hydraulic con-trollers with an electromechanical valve actuated by a universal microprocessor based controller. Since the majority of controller functions include a pressure override capability, the constant pressure <b>override</b> <b>control</b> (CPOC) function has been investigated in detail. The CPOC controller varies the pump flow rate to ensure that the hydraulic pipeline pres-sure remains constant despite variations in load. The micro-processor required an accurate measure of average line pressure. Preliminary tests showed that the axial pump superimposed large synchronous pressure ripples onto this average level. The results show that if careful signal con-ditioning is used to remove this ripple, a microprocessor based control unit can mimic the main control function of existing hydraulic controllers successfully. Design features required for a suitable prototype controller necessary for field trials are discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|Using the {{infection}} of quiescent human fibroblasts with adenovirus type 5 and various deletion mutants, {{we show that}} E 1 A can stimulate transcription of the cyclin A gene {{in the absence of}} exogenous growth factors. Required for this activity is conserved region 2 (CR 2), while both the N-terminal part of E 1 A and CR 1 are dispensable. This indicates that activation of cyclin A gene expression requires the binding of E 1 A to p 107, while binding to either pRB or p 300 is not involved in transcriptional activation. We demonstrate that p 107 represses the cyclin A promoter through its cell cycle-regulatory E 2 F binding site and that 12 S E 1 A can activate the cyclin A promoter, essentially by counteracting its repression by p 107. Since Cr 2 is required for cell transformation, transcriptional activation of the cyclin A gene by E 1 A appears to be important for its capacity to <b>override</b> <b>control</b> of cellular growth...|$|E
40|$|Robot {{interaction}} with the surrounding environment is an important and newsworthy problem {{in the context of}} industrial and service robotics. Collision avoidance gives the robot the ability to avoid contacts with objects around it, but most of the industrial controls implementing collision avoidance checks only the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) over the objects in the cell, without taking into account the shape of the tool, mounted on the robot flange.
