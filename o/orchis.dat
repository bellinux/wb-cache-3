5|$|A second subcommunity (MG5a) {{is present}} and is characterised by the legume Meadow vetchling (Lathyrus pratensis). Other species present in this subcommunity include Salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor), Quaking grass (Briza media), Pignut (Conopodium majus) and the Orchid species: Common Twayblade (Neottia ovata) and Early Purple Orchid (<b>Orchis</b> mascula). The subcommunity also {{contains}} Meadow barley (Hordeum secalinum), a perennial grass, {{which is a}} characteristic species of the Tees Lowland.|$|E
5|$|Twelve of {{them were}} {{inventoried}} in 2003, and their populations have been managed since. The light undergrowth contains common spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii) and round-leaved wintergreen (Pyrola rotundifolia). Liquorice milkvetch (Astragalus glycyphyllos) and narrow-leaved everlasting-pea (Lathyrus sylvestris) {{are present in the}} small herb glade. The population of lesser butterfly-orchid (Platanthera bifolia) is located in the pioneer wood. In the glade with Calamagrostide and at the boundary of a pioneer grove grow pyramidal orchid (Anacamptis pyramidalis). bee orchid (Ophrys apifera) and man orchid (<b>Orchis</b> anthropophora) grow everywhere, except in the older glade. In the different herbaceous fringes grow wood forget-me-not (Myosotis sylvatica) and zigzag clover (Trifolium medium). A tall herb fringe hosts common butterbur (Petasites hybridus).|$|E
5|$|On {{the steep}} grassy slopes above the River Avon, Bristol rockcress (Arabis scabra) which {{is unique to}} the Avon Gorge can be seen {{flowering}} in April; orchids and western spiked speedwell (Veronica spicata) are common in June and July. In autumn the woodland hosts over 300 species of fungi. Bilberry, a scarce plant in the Bristol area, is found in Leigh Woods, as is the parasitic plant yellow bird's-nest (Monotropa hypopitys). Lady orchid (<b>Orchis</b> purpurea) was discovered here in 1990, in Nightingale Valley; there is doubt as to whether this was a wild plant or an introduction. Green-flowered Helleborine (Epipactis phyllanthes) is found {{on the western side}} of the gorge, in a wooded area next to the towpath below Leigh Woods.|$|E
5|$|Between Kintbury Lock and Newbury, passing to {{the north}} of Hamstead Marshall, the canal is very close to the River Kennet, which flows into the canal via several channels. The canal passes through an area known as the Kennet Valley Alderwoods, the largest {{remaining}} fragments of damp, ash-alder woodland in the River Kennet floodplain. The SSSI includes two woods– the Wilderness and part of Ryott's Plantation– which are important because they support a very great diversity of plants associated with this woodland type, dominated by alder (Alnus glutinosa); though ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is abundant in places and there is occasional oak (Quercus robur) and wych elm (Ulmus glabra). In addition to the wide range of higher plants the woods support a diverse bryophyte flora including the uncommon epiphytes Radula complanata, Zygodon viridissimus and Orthotrichum affine. Nearby is Irish Hill Copse. This site of coppiced ancient woodland includes an extensive area of calcareous ash/wych elm coppice on the hill sides, merging into wet ash/maple and acid oak/ash/hazel woodland with aspen, on the higher parts of the site. The lower slopes are dominated by dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), with abundant herb paris (Paris quadrifolia), toothwort (Lathraea squamaria), Solomon's seal (Polygonatum multiflorum), twayblade and early purple orchids (Listera ovata) and <b>Orchis</b> mascula and, locally, wild daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus).|$|E

25|$|Aquatic {{plants are}} {{represented}} by many rare and protected species, such as the European white waterlily, yellow water-lily, Salvinia natans, water chestnut, Nymphoides peltata and others. Meadows are home to orchids, for example, <b>Orchis</b> coriophora (bug orchid), Military orchid, green-winged orchid, Epipactis helleborine, lesser butterfly-orchid, and others. The floodplains are covered with willows, alders, oaks, ashes, elms, poplars, European hornbeams, and dogwoods.|$|E
500|$|Around {{the end of}} April 1860, Darwin {{discussed}} {{insect pollination}} with his friend Joseph Dalton Hooker, and mentioned the bee orchid. Darwin corresponded with Hooker's assistant Daniel Oliver, the senior curator at Kew Gardens, who became a follower of Darwin's ideas. At the start of June, Darwin wrote to The Gardeners' Chronicle asking for readers' observations on how bee or fly orchids were fertilised. His letter described the mechanisms for insect fertilisation he had discovered in common British orchids, and reported his experimental observations that pollen masses were removed from <b>Orchis</b> morio and <b>Orchis</b> mascula plants in the open, but left in their pouches in adjacent plants under a glass bell jar. He wrote to American botanist Asa Gray {{that he had been}} [...] "so struck with admiration at the contrivances, that I have sent notice to Gardeners Chronicle", and made similar enquiries of other experts.|$|E
500|$|This is {{followed}} by descriptions {{of the differences in}} the mechanisms of several other orchids. In <b>Orchis</b> pyramidalis, the adhesive balls are combined together into a strap or saddle shape, which curls round the thin proboscis of a moth or butterfly to attach to it the pair of pollen masses, illustrated in the book by [...] showing a moth's head with seven pairs of pollen masses attached to its proboscis.|$|E
500|$|The {{completed}} <b>Orchis</b> paper came to 140 folio pages, and Darwin {{decided against}} presenting {{it at the}} Linnean Society of London, thinking of publishing a pamphlet instead. He offered the draft to John Murray who agreed to publish it as a book. Although Darwin feared a lack of public interest, he hoped it would serve to [...] "illustrate how Natural History may be worked under the belief of the modification of Species". In discussions with Asa Gray about natural theology, he wrote that [...] "it really seems to me incredibly monstrous to look at an orchid as created as we now see it. Every part reveals modification on modification." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} chapter Darwin {{described}} the British orchids he had studied, giving detailed explanations of their various mechanisms for transferring pollen to insects. The first mechanism described is that of <b>Orchis</b> mascula, which serves as {{an introduction to the}} explanation of other Orchidaceae. In {{the upper part of the}} flower a petal shelters the male organ which has two packages of pollen grains, held together by thin elastic threads. These pollen masses stand side by side and have stalks down to adhesive balls in a cup which keeps them moist and sticky. When an insect lands on the large projecting lower petal, the labellum, and pushes its head and proboscis into the centre of the flower and down to the nectary, it breaks the cup and the adhesive balls attach the pollen masses to the front of the insect. As the insect flies off, each stalk rotates the pollen mass downwards and forwards so that when the insect lands on another flower the pollen masses attached to the insect pass under the male organ and leave pollen on the female organ, achieving cross fertilisation. Darwin envisaged: ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{cryptorchidism}} {{nearly always}} refers to congenital absence or maldescent, a testis {{observed in the}} scrotum in early infancy can occasionally [...] "reascend" [...] (move back up) into the inguinal canal. A testis which can readily move or be moved between the scrotum and canal {{is referred to as}} retractile. The word is from the Greek κρυπτός, kryptos, meaning [...] hidden ὄρχις, <b>orchis,</b> meaning testicle.|$|E
2500|$|Lustration; this one-day festival {{took place}} on the third day of the third moon (dubbed the [...] "double-three"), and {{traditionally}} was meant to dispel evil and wash away defilement in a river with scented aromatic <b>orchis</b> plants. By the Tang era it had become a time of baudy celebration, feasting, wine drinking, and writing poetry. The Tang court annually served up a special batch of deep fried pastries as dessert for the occasion, most likely served in the Serpentine River Park.|$|E
2500|$|Switzerland {{has one of}} Europe's oldest green roofs, {{created in}} 1914 at the Moos lake water-treatment plant, Wollishofen, Zürich. [...] Its filter tanks have [...] of flat {{concrete}} roofs. [...] To keep the interior cool and prevent bacterial growth in the filtration beds, a drainage layer of gravel and a 15-cm (6-in) layer of soil was spread over the roofs, which had been waterproofed with asphalt. [...] A meadow developed from seeds already present in the soil; {{it is now a}} haven for many plant species, some of which are now otherwise extinct in the district, most notably 6,000 <b>Orchis</b> morio (green-winged orchid). [...] More recent Swiss examples can be found at Klinikum 1 and Klinikum 2, the Cantonal Hospitals of Basel, and the Sihlpost platform at Zürich's main railway station.|$|E
2500|$|Woodlands in North Dorset are scarce, and Piddles Wood {{is one of}} only {{a handful}} of such sites. Due to the heavy neutral and lighter acid soil types—caused by the {{underlying}} Kimmeridge Clay and Plateau Gravels—the site has a varying woodland flora, containing broadleaved, mixed and yew lowland. However, it is dominated by oak and [...] hazel—for which reason the site was listed as an SSSI—and its flora and fauna is typical of oak woodland in Dorset. Piddles Wood has an abundance of ground flora, including woodruff (Galium odoratum), sanicle (Sanicula europaea), early purple orchid (<b>Orchis</b> mascula), wood spurge (Euphorbia amygdaloides) and orpine (Sedum telephium). The site is also very rich for insect fauna, and among the butterflies found on the site are the white admiral (Limenitis camilla), wood white (Leptidea sinapis) and silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia); it was previously home to the pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), although this is now believed to be extinct in Dorset. Adjacent to the edge of the site is an extensive poultry farm, containing approximately 100,000 birds.|$|E

6000|$|... "China Aster {{remained}} standing just where <b>Orchis</b> had left him; when, suddenly, two elderly friends, having {{nothing better to}} do, dropped in for a chat. The chat over, China Aster, in greasy cap and apron, ran after <b>Orchis,</b> and said: 'Friend <b>Orchis,</b> heaven will reward you for your good intentions, but here is your check, and now give me my note.' ...|$|E
60|$|At this {{juncture}} <b>Orchis</b> was heard of. <b>Orchis,</b> it seemed {{had returned from}} his travels, and clandestinely married, and, {{in a kind of}} queer way, was living in Pennsylvania among his wife's relations, who, among other things, had induced him to join a church, or rather semi-religious school, of Come-Outers; and what was still more, <b>Orchis,</b> without coming to the spot himself, had sent word to his agent to dispose of some of his property in Marietta, and remit him the proceeds. Within a year after, China Aster received a letter from <b>Orchis,</b> commending him for his punctuality in paying the first year's interest, and regretting the necessity that he (<b>Orchis)</b> was now under of using all his dividends; so he relied upon China Aster's paying the next six months' interest, and of course with the back interest. Not more surprised than alarmed, China Aster thought of taking steamboat to go and see <b>Orchis,</b> but he was saved that expense by the unexpected arrival in Marietta of <b>Orchis</b> in person, suddenly called there by that strange kind of capriciousness lately characterizing him. No sooner did China Aster hear of his old friend's arrival than he hurried to call upon him. He found him curiously rusty in dress, sallow in cheek, and decidedly less gay and cordial in manner, which the more surprised China Aster, because, in former days, he had more than once heard <b>Orchis,</b> in his light rattling way, declare that all he (<b>Orchis)</b> wanted to make him a perfectly happy, hilarious, and benignant man, was a voyage to Europe and a wife, with a free development of his inmost nature.|$|E

So <b>Orchis,</b> being abroad, could not help China Aster's paying his interest as he did, however much he might have been opposed to it; for China Aster paid it to Orchis's agent, who was of too business-like a turn to decline interest regularly paid in on a loan.|$|E
60|$|The {{flowers are}} quite {{different}} from those of the peaty marshes on the opposite side of the district, belonging to an alluvial soil, washed down from the chalk hills. The great reed-mace adorns the Itchen, and going along the disused towing path of the canal there is to be found abundance of the black and golden spikes of the sedge, and the curious balls of the bur-reed, very like the horrid German weapon called a morning star. Also meadow-sweet, meadow-rue, and comfrey of every shade of purple, the water avens and forget-me-not, also that loveliest plant the bog-bean, with trefoil leaves and feathery blossoms. <b>Orchis</b> latifolia is in plenty, and also <b>Orchis</b> incarnata, sometimes called the Romsey <b>orchis.</b> Of late years the mimulus has gilded the bank of one of the ditches. Is it compensation for the Pinguicula vulgaris, which has been drained away, or the mountain pink at Highbridge, which I suspect some gardener of appropriating? Higher up the course of the river, <b>Orchis</b> conopsea, long-spurred and very sweet, the compact <b>Orchis</b> pyramidalis, and the rare Epipactis palustris are to be found, as well as Campanula Glomerata, and crow garlic, in an old chalk-pit nearly destroyed by the railway and the water works.|$|E

"At first, China Aster {{was going}} to tear it up, but {{thinking}} that this {{ought not to be}} done except {{in the presence of the}} drawer of the check, he mused a while, and picking it up, trudged back to the candlery, fully resolved to call upon <b>Orchis</b> soon as his day's work was over, and destroy the check before his eyes. But it so happened that when China Aster called, <b>Orchis</b> was out, and, having waited for him a weary time in vain, China Aster went home, still with the check, but still resolved not to keep it another day. Bright and early next morning he would a second time go after <b>Orchis,</b> and would, no doubt, make a sure thing of it, by finding him in his bed; for since the lottery-prize came to him, <b>Orchis,</b> besides becoming more cheery, had also grown a little lazy. But as destiny would have it, that same night China Aster had a dream, in which a being in the guise of a smiling angel, and holding a kind of cornucopia in her hand, hovered over him, pouring down showers of small gold dollars, thick as kernels of corn. 'I am Bright Future, friend China Aster,' said the angel, 'and if you do what friend <b>Orchis</b> would have you do, just see what will come of it.' With which Bright Future, with another swing of her cornucopia, poured such another shower of small gold dollars upon him, that it seemed to bank him up all round, and he waded about in it like a maltster in malt.|$|E

"Now, as kind heaven will so have it that to {{a hungry}} man bread is a great temptation, and, therefore, he is not too harshly to be blamed, if, when freely offered, he take it, even though it be {{uncertain}} whether he shall {{ever be able to}} reciprocate; so, to a poor man, proffered money is equally enticing, and the worst that can be said of him, if he accept it, is just what can be said in the other case of the hungry man. In short, the poor candle-maker's scrupulous morality succumbed to his unscrupulous necessity, as is now and then apt to be the case. He took the check, and was about carefully putting it away for the present, when <b>Orchis,</b> switching about again with his gold-headed cane, said: 'By-the-way, China Aster, it don't mean anything, but suppose you make a little memorandum of this; won't do any harm, you know.' So China Aster gave <b>Orchis</b> his note for one thousand dollars on demand. <b>Orchis</b> took it, and looked at it a moment, 'Pooh, I told you, friend China Aster, I wasn't going ever to make any demand.' Then tearing up the note, and switching away again at the candle-boxes, said, carelessly; 'Put it at four years.' So China Aster gave <b>Orchis</b> his note for one thousand dollars at four years. 'You see I'll never trouble you about this,' said <b>Orchis,</b> slipping it in his pocket-book, 'give yourself no further thought, friend China Aster, than how best to invest your money.

When still the next interest-day for <b>Orchis</b> came round, it found China Aster worse off than ever; for, besides his other troubles, he was now weak with sickness. Feebly dragging himself to Orchis' agent, he met him in the street, told him just how it was; upon which the agent, with a grave enough face, {{said that he had}} instructions from his employer not to crowd him about the interest at present, but to say to him that about the time the note would mature, <b>Orchis</b> would have heavy liabilities to meet, and therefore the note must at that time be certainly paid, and, of course, the back interest with it; and not only so, but, as <b>Orchis</b> had had to allow the interest for good part of the time, he hoped that, for the back interest, China Aster would, in reciprocation, have no objections to allowing interest on the interest annually.

Telling these things to Old Plain Talk, that man of some knowledge of the world shook his old head, and told China Aster that, though he hoped it might prove otherwise, yet it seemed to him that all he had communicated about <b>Orchis</b> worked together for bad omens as to his future forbearance--especially, he added with a grim sort of smile, in view of his joining the sect of Come-Outers; for, if some men knew what was their inmost natures, instead of coming out with it, they would try their best to keep it in, which, indeed, was the way with the prudent sort.
