5|$|Nicholas Sander, a Catholic recusant born c. 1530, was {{committed}} to deposing Elizabeth I and re-establishing Catholicism in England. In his De <b>Origine</b> ac Progressu schismatis Anglicani (The Rise and Growth of the Anglican Schism), published in 1585, {{he was the first}} to write that Anne had six fingers on her right hand. Since physical deformities were generally interpreted as a sign of evil, it is unlikely that Anne Boleyn would have gained Henry's romantic attention had she had any. Upon exhumation in 1876, no abnormalities were discovered. Her frame was described as delicate, approximately 5'3", with finely formed, tapering fingers.|$|E

25|$|Barbaresco is an Italian wine {{made with}} the Nebbiolo grape. Barbaresco is {{produced}} in the Piedmont region {{in an area of}} the Langhe immediately to the east of Alba and specifically in the comunes of Barbaresco, Treiso and Neive plus that area of the frazione San Rocco Seno d'Elvio which was once part of the comune of Barbaresco and now belongs to the comune of Alba. It was granted Denominazione di <b>origine</b> controllata (DOC) status in 1966 and Denominazione di <b>Origine</b> Controllata e Garantita status in 1980. The wine is often compared with Barolo—another Nebbiolo based wine from the Piedmont area. Though the wines do share many similarities, there are some distinct differences between them.|$|E
25|$|Valpolicella is a viticultural {{zone of the}} {{province}} of Verona, Italy, east of Lake Garda.

25|$|This {{system is}} similar to {{appellation}} systems used throughout the world, such as the appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) used in France, the denominazione di <b>origine</b> controllata (DOC) used in Italy, the denominação de origem controlada (DOC) used in Portugal, the denominación de origen (DO) system used in Spain and the Denumire de <b>origine</b> controlată (DOC) system used in Romania. In many cases, the EU PDO/PGI system works parallel with the system used in the specified country, {{and in some cases}} is subordinated to the appellation system that was already instituted, particularly with wine, for example, and in France (in particular) with cheese, for example Maroilles (as most others) has both PDO (Appellation d'origine protégée (AOP) in French) and AOC classifications, but generally only the AOC classification will be shown.|$|E

25|$|Friuli-Venezia Giulia wine (or Friuli wine) is wine made in {{the northeastern}} Italian region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia. Once part of the Venetian Republic and with {{sections}} {{under the influence of}} the Austro-Hungarian Empire for some time, the wines of the region have noticeable Slavic and Germanic influences. There are 11 Denominazione di <b>origine</b> controllata (DOC) and 3 Denominazione di <b>Origine</b> Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia area. The region has 3 Indicazione Geografica Tipica (IGT) designations Alto Livenza, delle Venezie and Venezia Giulia. Nearly 62% of the wine produced in the region falls under a DOC designation. The area is known predominantly for its white wines which are considered some of the best examples of Italian wine in that style. Along with the Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, the Friuli-Venezia Giulia forms the Tre Venezie wine region which ranks with Tuscany and Piedmont as Italy's world class wine regions.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} World War II, Brunello di Montalcino had {{developed}} {{a reputation as one}} of Italy's rarest wines. The only commercial producer recorded in government documents was the Biondi-Santi firm, which had declared only four vintages up to that point—1888, 1891, 1925, and 1945. The high price and prestige of these wines soon encouraged other producers to emulate Biondi-Santi's success. By the 1960s there were 11 producers making Brunello, and in 1968 the region was granted Denominazione di <b>Origine</b> Controllata (DOC) status. By 1970 the number of producers had more than doubled to 25, and by 1980 there were 53 producers. In 1980, the Montalcino region was the first Italian wine region to be awarded Denominazione di <b>Origine</b> Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) designation. By the turn of the 21st century, there were nearly 200 producers of Brunello di Montalcino, mostly small farmers and family estates, producing nearly 330,000 cases a year.|$|E

Grüner Veltliner is a permitted variety in the Denominazione di <b>origine</b> controllata (DOC) wines of Valdadige DOC and Valle Isarco DOC.|$|E
