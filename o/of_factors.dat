40|$|We have {{explored}} the molecular {{basis of the}} clinical therapeutic effect <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> VIIa in hemophilia A using empirical reconstituted in vitro thrombin generation models. Tissue factor acts as a receptor and activator of preexistent but virtually inactive two-chain plasma factor VIIa. However, most <b>of</b> the <b>factor</b> VII circulates as a single-chain inactive zymogen (10 nM) and a trace (approximately 10 - 100 pM) circulates in the active two-chain form. Empirical reconstitution (purified factors VIIa, X, IX, VIII, V, prothrombin, and relipidated tissue factor) showed that plasma concentrations <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> VII (10 nM) prolong the initiation phase of thrombin generation significantly at low concentrations <b>of</b> tissue <b>factor</b> and 100 pM factor VIIa. Thus, we show {{for the first time}} that the zymogen factor VII may have a very significant inhibitory action on thrombin generation at physiologic ratios <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> VII to factor VIIa. The inhibition kinetics <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> Xa generation by low concentrations <b>of</b> tissue <b>factor</b> indicate that factor VII inhibits the reaction by competition for the initial binding <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> VIIa to tissue <b>factor.</b> Physiological concentrations <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> VII also inhibit the maximal rate of thrombin generation by 100 pM factor VIIa in the absence <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> VIII. Increasing the concentration <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> VIIa to 2 nM in this hemophilia A model overcame the inhibition of thrombin generation by 10 nM factor VII. Increasing the concentration up to 10 nM factor VIIa in the absence <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> VIII completely normalized the thrombin generation profile to that observed in the presence <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> VIII and 10 nM factor VII/ 100 pM factor VIIa. The levels <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> VIIa that overcome the inhibitory effect <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> VII and that normalize thrombin generation in our model are consistent with the observed plasma levels <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> VIIa needed to manage hemophilia A. Our data strongly indicate that the therapeutic mechanism <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> VIIa in the medical treatment of hemophiliacs with inhibitors is in large part based on overcoming the inhibitory effect <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> VII on thrombin generatio...|$|R

40|$|A {{localized}} {{and regulated}} cascade of proteolytic events {{is a prerequisite}} for normal haemostasis. The activation <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> X by activated factor IX (factor IXa) in the presence <b>of</b> activated <b>factor</b> VIII (factor VIIIa) is essential for the formation of a fibrin clot at sites of vascular injury. We observed sustained activation <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> X on the surface of vascular endothelial cells, whereas, in agreement with others, on synthetic negatively charged phospholipid vesicles and activated blood platelets factor X activation is transient and starts to decline a few minutes after the onset of the reaction. We examined the mechanism responsible for these differences in factor X activation. Procoagulant membrane and solution were analysed separately for the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> VIII and its activation fragments. On negatively charged phospholipid vesicles, on dissociation <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> VIIIa, the 67 kDa light-chain fragment remains associated with the lipid membrane. As a result, factor VIII-binding sites remain occupied, and dampening <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> X activation occurs. In contrast, on monolayers of endothelial cells, no residual factor VIIIa fragments associated with the cell membrane were observed. During endothelial-cell-mediated activation <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> X, accumulation <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> VIIIa fragments was observed in the solution phase only. This finding suggests that, on endothelial cells, factor VIII-binding sites remain accessible for further factor VIII binding, guaranteeing sustained activation <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> X.

The mitogenic activity <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> VIIa disappeared in serum immunopurified in factor X and was almost totally inhibited by DX 9065, a selective factor Xa inhibitor, showing that this effect <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> VIIa occurred via factor Xa generated during the incubation period. Hirudin did not show any significant effect on factor VIIa-induced fibroblast proliferation, thus showing that the effect observed for factor VIIa was selectively mediated by factor Xa and was not due to thrombin formation.

5|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>factors</b> are {{involved}} in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides.

Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.|$|E
5|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>factors</b> can {{potentially}} {{increase the risk}} of developing paracetamol toxicity.

In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less. Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists. For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect. For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.|$|E

40|$|Thrombin {{cleavage}} <b>of</b> blood coagulation <b>Factor</b> XIII (a 2 b 2) and fibrinogen was studied during {{in vitro}} clotting {{to determine the}} physiologic sequence of these events. First, {{the time course of}} fibrin formation and cleavage <b>of</b> <b>Factor</b> XIII was measured in platelet-rich plasma. Cleavage of fibrinogen was measured by using a radioimmunoassay for fibrinopeptide A. Conversion of trace amounts of radioiodinated a-chains of 125 I-Factor XIII to thrombin-modified a-chains was measured in unreduced 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. During spontaneous clotting, a similar percentage of 125 I-Factor XIII and fibrinogen was cleaved at each time point. Visible gelation of polymerized fibrin monomer occurred when 24 +/- 8 % of fibrinogen was cleaved and 21 +/- 6 % <b>of</b> <b>Factor</b> XIII was converted to Factor XIII'. Thrombin cleavage <b>of</b> <b>Factor</b> XIII and fibrinogen was also studied in platelet-poor plasma to which thrombin was added. In order to measure Factor XIIIa activity, fibrin polymerization was completely inhibited by the addition <b>of</b> Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro. <b>Factor</b> XIIIa formation was measured by the incorporation of [3 H]putrescine into casein. The concentration of added thrombin required to cleave 50 % <b>of</b> fibrinogen and <b>Factor</b> XIII was 0. 65 U/ml and 0. 35 U/ml, respectively. The rate of cleavage of fibrinogen by thrombin was 43 -fold greater than cleavage <b>of</b> <b>Factor</b> XIII. Lower Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro concentrations were used {{to determine the effects of}} incompletely inhibiting fibrin polymerization on cleavage <b>of</b> <b>Factor</b> XIII and fibrinogen. Thrombin cleavage <b>of</b> <b>Factor</b> XIII but not fibrinogen was dependent on the extent of fibrin polymerization. The more marked the degree of inhibition of fibrin polymerization, the slower the rate <b>of</b> <b>Factor</b> XIIIa formation. Thus, in platelet-rich plasma, thrombin cleavage <b>of</b> <b>Factor</b> XIII and fibrinogen are closely related events during spontaneous clotting.
