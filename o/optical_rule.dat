Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Stress optical data from polyelectrolytes (sodium polystyrenesulfonate) in aqueous solutions have been determined using flow birefringence. The stress <b>optical</b> <b>rule</b> was found to be violated in the semidilute unentangled concentration regime but was found valid in the I semidilute entangled regime for shear rates above 100 s- 1. It is shown that the stress <b>optical</b> <b>rule</b> violation in the semidilute entangled regime occur as a result of spatial inhomogenity. In the sentidilute unentangled regime, the stress <b>optical</b> <b>rule</b> fails from both spatial inhomogenity and excessive stretching of the polymer chain. In addition, the orientation of polyions were found to be strongly shear rate dependent for all concentrations. In stress relaxation measurements, the relaxation times were observed to be independent of concentration in the semidilute entangled regime (>IO mg/ml). In the semidilute unentangled regime, the relaxation times were highly dependent on concentration and scales as c- 0. 5 and this behavior was observed over two decades of concentration (0. 05 mg/ml-I mg/n-fl). In steady shear experiments, the viscosity-versus-shear rate curves manifest at least three distinct flow regimes that are sin-tilar to those observed in textured polymer liquid crystals. Thus, in analogy to liquid crystal polymers where excluded volume interactions cause texturing, we show {{for the first time that}} iv electrostatic interactions in polyelectrolytes can cause domain formation. As in liquid crystalline polymers, the domain size and uniformity appears to depend on molecular weight and concentration. Steady shear experiments also show that the viscosity scales as q c 112 Ml-oin the semidilute unentangled regime and as q c 3 l 2 M 3 in the entangled semidilute regime, in agreement with a recent theory by Dobrynin et all. The relaxation time, however, scales as,r M-IC- 112 in the semidilute unentangled regime and as T-Moco in the semidilute entangled regime. This last observation is at odds with scaling theory that suppose reptation-like dynamics in the semidilute entangled regime. Rather, we propose that polyelectrolyte chains at these high concentrations interact to form a virtually permanent network of isotropic chains. When the network is deformed, the chains react by instantaneously snapping back to their original length. The addition of salt to the polyelectrolyte solution could disrupt this network and thus cause a recovery of reptation diffusion, as in solutions of uncharged entangled polymers...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of three dimensional effects on isochromatic birefringence is evaluated for planar flows {{by means of}} numerical simulation. Two fluid models are investigated in channel and abrupt contraction geometries. In practice, the flows are confined by viewing windows, which alter the stresses along the optical path. The observed optical properties differ therefore from their counterpart in an ideal two-dimensional flow. To investigate the {{influence of}} these effects, the stress <b>optical</b> <b>rule</b> and the differential propagation Mueller matrix are used. The material parameters are selected so that a retardation of multiple orders is achieved, as is typical for highly birefringent melts. Errors due to three dimensional effects are mainly found on the symmetry plane, and increase significantly with the flow rate. Increasing the geometric aspect ratio improve the accuracy provided that the error on the retardation is less than one order. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Microscopic structural properties including mean squared radius of gyration, distribution of beads from the center of mass and from the core and the interpenetration function of these systems were characterized. A relationship between the zero shear rate mean squared radius of gyration and the Wiener index was established. The molecular and bond alignment tensors were analyzed to characterize the flow birefringence of these hyperbranched polymers. The melt rheology was also studied and the crossover from the Newtonian to non-Newtonian behavior was captured for all polymer fluids in the considered range of strain rates. Rheological properties including the shear viscosity and normal stress coefficients obtained from constant pressure simulations were found to be the same as those from constant volume simulations except at high strain rates due to shear dilatancy.

Lithographers must guarantee high imaging fidelity throughout the entire range of normal process variations. As a result, post-OPC verification methods have become indispensable tools for avoiding pattern printing issues. A post-OPC verification technique known as critical failure <b>optical</b> <b>rule</b> checking (CFORC) was recently introduced and has proven its efficiency for detecting potential printing issues through the entire process window [S.

In this article, we investigated what adults expect to be {{the field of view}} of a mirror from various viewpoints. The studies presented here confirm that humans have difficulty dealing with the role of the viewpoint in reflections and consistently prove that predictions are dominated by two patterns and a frontal bias. The majority of adults correctly predict that, from a central viewpoint, the space reflected in a mirror expands beyond the orthogonal projections to both its edges. For eccentric viewpoints, half of the participants expected a different (correct) behavior, while the other half also predicted, in this case, expansion at both edges. This means that, contrary to what happens in reality, they expected the mirror to show the space that is orthogonally in front of it and also beyond it, whatever the position of the observer (frontal bias). The error also persisted after the observation of a real reflection. However, this was not found to be true with windows.

In addition, the experimental stress field for slit flow was determined from isochromatic retardation bands of the flow-induced birefringence (FIB) patterns by assuming the linear stress <b>optical</b> <b>rule</b> to be valid. The MPR results were compared with steady-state numerical predictions of the viscoelastic integral Wagner model, simulated using a finite element code, POLYFLOW. The effect of slip boundary conditions on the numerical predictions of 1 P and slit principal stress difference (PSD) was investigated; the comparison was made for the capillary 1 P data obtained at two temperatures (170 and 190 C) and the slit results at 170 C. For the lower stress data at 190 C, a good match between experiment and simulation was obtained. At the lower temperature and higher stress {{it was necessary to}} introduce slip in order to match the results. Non-isothermal power law simulations suggest that shear heating effects cannot fully explain the low temperature extreme L/D data. Therefore, we tentatively conclude the necessity to introduce a wall high shear stress slip effect. For the slit geometry, the centreline principal stress difference birefringence tracking shows good agreement with the simulations. It was found that the simulated centreline |PSD | was not very sensitive to the addition of wall slip. However, in order to obtain a good match with the overall pressure difference for the slit geometry, it was again necessary to introduce a slip component at the wall. © 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|It is {{becoming}} more and more difficult to ensure robust patterning after OPC due to the continuous reduction of layout dimensions and diminishing process windows associated with each successive lithographic generation. Lithographers must guarantee high imaging fidelity throughout the entire range of normal process variations. The techniques of Mask Rule Checking (MRC) and <b>Optical</b> <b>Rule</b> Checking (ORC) have become mandatory tools for ensuring that OPC delivers robust patterning. However the first method relies on geometrical checks and the second one is based on a model built at best process conditions. Thus those techniques do not have the ability to address all potential printing errors throughout the process window (PW). To address this issue, a technique known as Critical Failure ORC (CFORC) was introduced that uses optical parameters from aerial image simulations. In CFORC, a numerical model is used to correlate these optical parameters with experimental data taken throughout the process window to predict printing errors. This method has proven its efficiency for detecting potential printing issues through the entire process window [1]. However this analytical method is based on optical parameters extracted via an optical model built at single process conditions. It is reasonable to expect that a verification method involving optical models built from several points throughout PW would provide more accurate predictions of printing errors for complex features. To verify this approach, compact optical models similar to those used for standard OPC were built and calibrated with experimental data measured at the PW limits. This model is then applied to various test patterns to predict potential printing errors. In this paper, a comparison between these two approaches is presented for the poly layer at 65 nm node patterning. Examples of specific failure predictions obtained separately with the two techniques are compared with experimental results.

40|$|Uniaxial {{deformation}} {{behavior of}} PEN {{films in the}} rubbery state is investigated {{as a function of}} processing temperature, draw rate, and molecular weight (Mw). Real-time measurement of true stress- true strain and birefringence of the films during the process of stretching is obtained by using a novel instrumented uniaxial stretching machine that couples the spectral birefringence system with the real- time strain detection system. This enables quantitative measurement of true stress-true strain and birefringence, enabling quick and nonstop measurement of stress-optical behavior (SOB) of PEN. A three- regime SOB was obtained for PEN films: (i) regime Isstress <b>optical</b> <b>rule</b> applies with a stress optical constant (SOC) of 27. 5 GPa- 1; following this regime the behavior become nonlinear in (ii) regime II and birefringence rises steeply; finally in (iii) regime III, birefringence reaches a plateau while stress increases. All regimes are affected by the temperature, rate, and Mw. Decreasing temperature and increasing stretching rate and Mw extend the range of regime I over which the material remains amorphous. Regime II and III slopes were found to be dependent on rate and Mw. Measurement of strain rate indicates that affine deformation holds until the end of regime I, rising sharply in regime II, as a result of spontaneous deformation. The strain rate rapidly decreases to zero when regime III starts. The peak in strain rate coincides with the fast increase of birefringence during regime II. According to WAXD and DSC studies, the material remains amorphous in the regime I. Right after the transition to the regime II, the amorphous chains are extremely oriented but possess low translational order, which prevents them from crystallizing. Further stretching the structure evolves very rapidly to a crystalline structure, with approximately 40 % crystallinity that is maintained throughout the regime III {{at the end of which}} finite chain extensibility prevents further changes in the structure. A model representing the structural mechanisms followed from the amorphous to the crystalline state is suggested. Both rate and temperature have a significant effect on the structural development of PEN: at intermediate to high rates and low temperatures a semicrystalline structure is obtained whereas at very high temperatures and low rates the structure remains completely amorphous despite the large deformation that has been applied.

40|$|Solutions of biopolymers {{are often}} not {{homogeneously}} solved, but show overstructures {{in the form of}} associates and aggregates that strongly influence the flow behaviour. For the detection of the properties of the solution, rheo-mechanical measurements are not enough. Especially the behaviour on a molecular level in a flow field can only be measured by correlating rheo-optical and rheo-mechanical data. Using flow birefringence, flow dichroism and its orientations, detailed description of the deformation behaviour, the stability and the size of these overstructures can be given. The goal of this work was therefore the characterisation of the behaviour in the flow field of selected associating biopolymer solutions using a newly developed rheo-optical method. In the first part, the developement and the integration of the new rheo-optical device for measuring flow birfringence, flow dichroism and its orientations into a commercial rheometer with a synchronized recording of the mechanical and the optical data is described. For that a prototype of a laser device using three diode lasers with different planes of polarization working in an alternating pulsed mode that are aimed in a single optical path through a measuring cell was build. The heart of the laser device is a collocation of thin-film-polarizers and polarizing and non-polarizing beam splitting prisms that allow for a interferenceless combination of the differently polarized laser beams in a single optical path. For the pulsed control of the laser as well as the intensity measuring unit after the rheological measuring cell, an electronical control device was conceived that also functioned as an interface to the analyzing computer. For the analysis of the high frequency signal an algorithm was developed using the graphical programming language LabView which allowed for a seperation of the output signal and a correlation to the exciting input frequency. For the mathematical analysis of the output signal, the Mueller-matrices of the polarized lasers after going through the measuring cell were calculated and an approximation method was developed that allowed the calculation of the flow birefringence and dichroism from the phase difference of the lasers. The calculation of the optical material functions were then integrated into the LabView program, so {{that for the first time}} an online measurement with a graphical presentation of the rheo-optical material functions after the new measuring method was possible. For the verification of the capability of the new device and a comparison with the old rheo-optical methods, rheo-optical measurements with a hydroxypropylcellulose(HPC) /water system were made. The solution of the birefringence of the new device is a decade lower than the old methods, but allows for a synchronized presentation of rheo-mechanical and rheo-optical data. Furthermore it is possible with the new method to show the optical material functions online while measuring. The new device is also smaller, less expensive and shortens the needed calibration and measuring time up to 90 %. In the second part of this work the structure-property-relationships of pseudo plastic flow for the polymer system (1, 3) (1, 4) --glucane/water was derived. Since the (1, 3) (1, 4) --glucanes are subject to a spontaneous gelation at room temperature, the measurement of a []-M-relationship at room temperature was not possible. The dependence of the critical flow curve parameters was therefore derived directly in dependence of the intrinsic viscosity []. To the already known  0 -[]-c-relationship the subsequent  0 -[]-c- and n-[]-c-relationships were derived. Together with the modified Carreau model the -[]-c-g-relationship could be established: For the rheo-optical material functions, starting from the stress <b>optical</b> <b>rule,</b> a new model for the correlation of the birefringence and its orientation with the shear state in an ideal homogeneous polymer solution was derived, that can also describe the behaviour in the non-Newtonian flow region and explain it with disentanglement. Following from that, two new structure-property-relationships could be derived, which with the before mentioned  0 -[]-c- and n-[]-c-relationships, allowed for a model of the rheo-optical material functions in dependence of the concentration and the intrinsic viscosity. The new theory was verified through measurements of the ideal polymer standard system polystyrene/toluene. Especially from the rheo-optical structure-property-relationships two new normalization methods for the Newtonian flow region were derived. For the birefringence and its orientation reduced values could be derived that depend only on the shear viscosity: For the non-Newtonian region it was possible to quantitatively specify the decline of the slope of the birefringence curve from the by dissentenglement caused negative slope n of the flow curve, as well as the substancially lower increase of the orientation angle. In the third part of this work, the flow behaviour of associates and aggregates was examined with the help of rheo-optical measurements for different biopolymer solutions. The detection of associated overstructures was first done using the (1, 3) (1, 4) --glucane/water system. By measuring the elastic part of the shear flow (storage modulus G‘ and first normal stress difference N 1) and the resulting main stresses, it was possible to show that at high shear rates the intrinsic birefringence is dominant. Using the stress <b>optical</b> <b>rule,</b> the normal stresses can be derived from the intrinsic birefringence. The from aggregation resulting form parts were distinguished from the intrinsic parts of the non-aggregated polymer segments using the above mentioned rheo-optical structure-property-relationship. The stress optical coefficient for the (1, 3) (1, 4) --glucane/water system was determined from the intrinsic parts at. For the form part of the birefringence, a from the shear viscosity dependend formation of a plateau regions could be detected, which can be attributed to a finit deformability of local aggregate structures in the sol state. Using the normalization of the birefringence n‘/ 0 after the newly developed rheo-optical structure-property-relationship, a change in the aggregate structure of the (1, 3) (1, 4) --glucane/water system below a critical concentration c+ could be detected, that corresponds with the transition from spontaneous to shear induced gelation. The dichroism, like the birefringence showed a pronounced plateau region in dependence of the shear rate, that was caused by the form part of the dichroism. In contrast to the birefringence, the plateau region could be detected at high shear rates. With the help of the on the concentration normalized dichroism, it could be shown that the aggregates below a critical concentration c+ are considerably larger, but the concentration of the aggregates proportionally to the segment density declines. This decline in the aggregate concentration is a possible explaination for the up to now unexplainable suspension of the spontaneous gelation below c+. By measuring the orientation angle of the birefringence and the dichroism, it was possible to separate the early orientation of the aggregates in the shear field from the orientation of the segments. By depicting the orientation of the birefringence versus the reduced shear rate (= f(g/gkrit)) it could be shown that below c+ the orientation of the aggregates is independend of the concentration of the aggregates, but dependend of the surrounding polymer segments. The orientation angle of the dichroism shows a rise at high shear rates above c+, which is possibly caused by the appearance of an intrinsic part of the dichroism. This presumption is backed up by a rise of the dichroism at high shear rates above c+. Other biopolymer/water systems with a tendency towards association, such as mixtures of locust bean gum with -carrageenan or locus bean gum with potatoe starch, were taken into account as a comparison. Depicting the reduced birefringence n‘/ 0 allowed for a possibility of a quantitatively estimation of the intermolecular interaction in the mixtures since the absolute polymer concentration was held constant. For the stress optical coefficient of the mixture of locust bean gum with potatoe starch a linear dependence from the ratio of the composition of the mixture could be shown, which can be attributed soley to the birefringend properties of the polymer segment part of the solution. The form part shows for both mixtures plateau regions, which point to finitly deformable aggregate structures. A maximum interaction results from the position of the flow region of the reduced depiction of the birefringence for the locust bean gum/-carrageenan at a ratio of 1 : 4. For locus bean gum with potatoe starch a maximum in the interaction was found at a ration between 1 : 4 and 2 : 3. A temperatur induced aggregation that leads to phase separation, was found for the system HPC/water. Whereas for these solutions at room temperature a behaviour was detected that coincides with the intrinsic parts of the new rheo-optical structure-property-relationship, measurement taken into account as a comparison at a temperature of 39 °C show, that before the onset of the phase separation a form birefringence could be detected. In contrast to the (1, 3) (1, 4) --glucane solutions the level of the form part increases with the concentration for the HPC. Thus in this case with an increasing segment density an enlargement of the aggregates, i. e. an intensification of the deformability with increasing segment density can be assumed. nrpages: 141 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} theory of optical {{absorption}} by interlayer excitons in a heterobilayer formed from transition metal dichalcogenides. The theory accounts {{for the presence of}} small relative rotations that produce a momentum shift between electron and hole bands located in different layers, and a moiré pattern in real space. Because of the momentum shift, the optically active interlayer excitons are located at the moiré Brillouin zone's corners, instead of at its center, and would have elliptical <b>optical</b> selection <b>rules</b> if the individual layers were translationally invariant. We show that the exciton moiré potential energy restores circular <b>optical</b> selection <b>rules</b> by coupling excitons with different center of mass momenta. A variety of interlayer excitons with both senses of circular optical activity, and energies that are tunable by twist angle, are present at each valley. The lowest energy exciton states are generally localized near the exciton potential energy minima. We discuss the possibility of using the moiré pattern to achieve scalable two-dimensional arrays of nearly identical quantum dots. Comment: 13 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|Inversion {{symmetry}} breaking allows contrasted circular dichroism {{in different}} k -space regions, which takes the extreme form of <b>optical</b> selection <b>rules</b> for interband transitions at high symmetry points. In materials where band edges occur at noncentral valleys, this enables valley-dependent interplay of electrons with light of different circular polarizations, in analogy to spin dependent optical activities in semiconductors. This discovery is in perfect {{harmony with the}} previous finding of valley contrasted Bloch band features of orbital magnetic moment and Berry curvatures from inversion symmetry breaking. A universal connection is revealed between the k -resolved optical oscillator strength of interband transitions, the orbital magnetic moment and the Berry curvatures, which also provides a principle for optical measurement of orbital magnetization and intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity in ferromagnetic systems. The general physics is demonstrated in graphene where inversion symmetry breaking leads to valley contrasted <b>optical</b> selection <b>rule</b> for interband transitions. We discuss graphene based valley optoelectronics applications where light polarization information can be interconverted with electronic information. © 2008 The American Physical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

While the influence of strain on the electronic band structure has been intensively studied, {{there are only a}} few works on its impact on optical properties of monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Combining microscopic theory based on Wannier and Bloch equations with nearest-neighbor tight-binding approximation, we present an analytical view on how uni- and biaxial strain influences the optical fingerprint of TMDs, including their excitonic binding energy, oscillator strength, <b>optical</b> selection <b>rules,</b> and the radiative broadening of excitonic resonances. We show that the impact of strain can be reduced to changes in the lattice structure (geometric effect) and in the orbital functions (overlap effect). In particular, we demonstrate that the valley-selective <b>optical</b> selection <b>rule</b> is softened in the case of uniaxial strain due to the introduced asymmetry in the lattice structure. Furthermore, we reveal a considerable increase of the radiative dephasing due to strain-induced changes in the optical matrix element and the excitonic wave functions...|$|R
