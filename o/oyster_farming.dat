40|$|From 2000 onwards, the United States saw an {{increasing}} trend for the shellfish aquaculture practices especially along the Northeast coast. Despite the supporting majority of public regarding the shellfish aquaculture operations, these operations are sometimes opposed by local communities claiming the devaluation of housing property {{due to the}} construction of <b>oyster</b> <b>farm.</b> Since the uproars against the devaluing of housing property is directly affecting the lives of public, it is critically important to study the effect of construction of <b>oyster</b> <b>farm</b> on its value. A difference-in-difference (DoD) model within hedonic price model (HPM) was used to evaluate the effect of <b>oyster</b> <b>farm</b> on property value. We collected the details of the <b>oyster</b> <b>farms</b> operated in Rhode Island from the Coastal Resource Management Council (CRMC). Our housing sales data lists all the housing transactions in Rhode Island between 2000 and 2013. We used a linear mixed model with lot size as unit level fixed effect and city as random effect. The result showed that the DoD coefficient associated with interaction of distance bands and the construction of <b>oyster</b> <b>farm,</b> was statistically insignificant. The statistical insignificance of the coefficients suggests that there is not much change in housing value due {{to the construction of}} <b>oyster</b> <b>farm.</b> The analysis shows that houses further away from coastline will reduce the value of the property. One of the caveats of this study is lesser housing transactions since the construction of <b>oyster</b> <b>farm</b> happened in recent years...|$|R

5|$|The first {{specimens}} of C.mutica outside of its native range was recovered from Humboldt Bay, California by Donald M. Martin in 1973. Martin misidentified {{them as a}} subspecies of C.acanthogaster. He named them Caprella acanthogaster humboldtiensis. Additional specimens (also treated as C.acanthogaster or C. acanthogaster humboldtiensis) were recovered between 1976 and 1978 from the Oakland Estuary, Elkhorn Slough, and San Francisco Bay. It wasn't until 1981, when the specimens were correctly identified as C.mutica by Dan C. Marelli. Along with additional specimens discovered in 1983 in Coos Bay, Oregon, these populations {{are believed to have}} been introduced to the area {{as a result of the}} importation of oyster spat of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) from Japan for <b>oyster</b> <b>farming.</b> Oysters are usually transported with algae as a packing material, particularly Sargassum muticum in which C. mutica are associated with.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 in the United States, {{a serious}} {{outbreak}} of oyster-vectored disease {{was caused by}} Vibrio vulnificus. Although the number of victims was low, the mortality rate was high at 50%. About 10 cases have occurred annually since then and further {{research needs to be}} done to establish the epidemiology of the infections. The cases peak in mid-summer and autumn with no cases being reported in mid winter so there may be a link between the temperature at which the oysters are held between harvesting and consumption. In 1978, an oyster-associated gastrointestinal infection affecting more than 2,000 people occurred in Australia. The causative agent was found to be the Norwalk virus and the epidemic caused major economic difficulties to the <b>oyster</b> <b>farming</b> industry in the country. In 1988, an outbreak of hepatitis A associated with the consumption of inadequately cooked clams (Anadara subcrenata) took place in the Shanghai area of China. An estimated 290,000 people were infected and there were 47 deaths.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{location}} of Aransas bay, shipping {{has always been a}} major industry. Following the Civil War, the meatpacking industry became a major source of income for ports on the bay, especially Rockport and Fulton, where numerous slaughterhouses were constructed. In the early years of meatpacking, cattle were slaughtered strictly for their hide since {{there was no way to}} refrigerate the meat. As a result, most of the left over cow parts not used as pig feed, were disposed in the bay. This changed in 1871, when an ice machine was installed in a packing plant. By this time, the meatpacking industry near Aransas Bay reached its prime. Prior to the decline of the industry in the area, in 1880, 93% of the beef from Texas slaughterhouses were processed in Rockport-Fulton. Along with fishing, <b>oyster</b> <b>farming</b> and most notably shrimping became major industries on the bay in the early 20th century. Shipbuilding also developed and reached its prime following the first World War. During World War II, the United States Navy took over several shipyards. In 1936, oil was discovered on the bay. By 1946, 13 wells were in operation. In 1990, 498,703 barrels were produced, part of the 77 million barrels produced between 1936 and 1990. Today, tourism is a prosperous industry. Numerous hotels are set up along the bay for individuals wanting to fish, bird or sight-see. A large concentration of hotels are located in Rockport, where the bay's only beach (Rockport Beach) is located.|$|E

5|$|Oil {{has been}} pumped {{from the bay}} since 1912, but fishing has been a {{mainstay}} since humans have inhabited the area. In the early 1970s, recreational fishing accounted for a yearly input of $17million to the local economy, while commercial fishermen contributed $27.3 million. Commercial <b>oyster</b> <b>farming</b> was common in the bay until 1995, when the Texas Department of State Health Services suspended the practice, due to an unhealthy annual average zinc level of nearly 2500mg/kg in oysters, which as filter feeders, are affected by high levels of zinc in the water. The excessive zinc {{is believed to have}} been dumped into the bay by the American Smelting and Refining Company's Encycle Texas Incorporated subsidiary, which operated a zinc refinery at the site from 1942 to 1985. The Nueces Bay Power Station is also believed to have discharged zinc used for coolant until December 2002. Since that time, zinc levels in the bay have been reduced to slightly under 1000mg/kg, which remains above the healthy levels of 700mg/kg. The power station has since come under the control of the Topaz Power Group. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has established the Total Maximum Daily Load Program to measure the level of pollutants throughout the Nueces watershed, in an effort to restore the bay to safe levels of contaminants. Pesticides that seep into the bay from the heavy agricultural activity on the north shore can also spur adverse environmental effects.|$|E

Other large <b>oyster</b> <b>farming</b> areas in the US include the bays and estuaries along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico from Apalachicola, Florida in the east to Galveston, Texas in the west. Large beds of edible oysters are also found in Japan and Australia. In 2005, China accounted for 80% of the global oyster harvest. Within Europe, France remained the industry leader.|$|E
25|$|After {{slavery in}} New York was {{abolished}} in 1827, freedmen {{settled in the}} area known since colonial times as Sandy Ground, which was located {{in the area around}} what is now the intersection of Bloomingdale and Woodrow Roads in Rossville.

The area of Prince's Bay was the main hub and was within walking distance from Sandy Ground. Sandy Ground also served as an important stop on the Underground Railroad, and is the oldest continuously settled free black community in the United States. <b>Oyster</b> <b>farming</b> ended around 1916 due to water pollution in the harbor.|$|E
25|$|Oysters had {{thrived in}} the Thames Estuary since the Romans {{promoted}} them; they {{were sold in}} city streets and eaten raw. The Herne Bay, Hampton and Reculver Oyster Fishery Company was incorporated with £10,000 capital in £10 shares on 25 July 1864 with Frank Buckland as chairman and Mr Cholmondeley Pennell as deputy. 1860–1864 had been a boom year for <b>oyster</b> <b>farming,</b> especially in nearby Whitstable, and the Government supported the trade in 1866 by passing an Act to promote cultivation. The company's proposals included five oyster smacks or yawls, a pier with storehouses, housing for workers and five freshwater breeding ponds. In spite of objections from local business competition, the company acquired an Act of Parliament and land at Hampton. According to the Act of 25 July 1864, the company had sole rights to dredge for oysters for seven miles (11km) from Swalecliffe to Reculver and up to three miles (5km) – but mainly {{one and a half}} miles – from shore. The total area under its jurisdiction was nine square miles, of which a third was foreshore, and it employed thirty-three regular men; sometimes up to a hundred. In 1865 and 1866 their chairman Cholmondeley Pennell applied unsuccessfully for extensions to these rights. Before selling the oysters dredged from the Estuary, the company obtained brood oysters from Essex, France, the Netherlands and Portugal. The smacks took the oysters twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays to Billingsgate.|$|E

500|$|Nueces Bay is a northwestern {{extension}} of Corpus Christi Bay in the San Patricio and Nueces counties of Texas. The bay is {{fed by the}} Nueces River, forming a natural estuary, which renders it ecologically and economically vital to the surrounding area.

The bay is threatened by pollution from the heavy industry on its southern shore, which prevents <b>oyster</b> <b>farming.</b> [...] Petrochemical production and oil {{are important to the}} surrounding economies of the major settlements of Corpus Christi and Portland, found on the eastern shore and connected by the Nueces Bay Causeway at the bay's confluence with Corpus Christi Bay.|$|E
500|$|A pearl {{is created}} in the mantle of a mollusk when an {{irritant}} particle is surrounded by layers of nacre. Although most bivalves can create pearls, oysters in the family Pteriidae and freshwater mussels in the families Unionidae and Margaritiferidae are {{the main source of}} commercially available pearls because the calcareous concretions produced by most other species have no lustre. Finding pearls inside oysters is a very chancy business as hundreds of shells may need to be pried open before a single pearl can be found. Most pearls are now obtained from cultured shells where an irritant substance has been purposefully introduced to induce the formation of a pearl. A [...] "mabe" [...] (irregular) pearl can be grown by the insertion of an implant, usually made of plastic, under a flap of the mantle and next to the mother-of-pearl interior of the shell. A more difficult procedure is the grafting of a piece of oyster mantle into the gonad of an adult specimen together with the insertion of a shell bead nucleus. This produces a superior, spherical pearl. The animal can be opened to extract the pearl after about two years and reseeded so that it produces another pearl. Pearl <b>oyster</b> <b>farming</b> and pearl culture is an important industry in Japan and many other countries bordering the Indian and Pacific Oceans.|$|E
