5|$|Black Christmas {{has three}} {{alternate}} endings, {{the second of}} which {{was used as the}} actual ending for the UK theatrical release of the movie. In the UK ending, Billy dies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> table from his wounds, thus when Kelli kills Agnes, the scene ends there with her parents picking her up from the hospital. The third ending is similar, having Billy die and Kelli's parents picking her up, however his body disappears and the last shot shows someone moving through the vents, indicating that either Agnes or Billy are still alive. The first ending, which follows the original script, ends with both Kelli and Leigh surviving and Kelli getting a call from someone using Kyle's cellphone.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of age <b>on</b> <b>the</b> late retrograde effects of unilateral sciatic nerve section {{was investigated in}} rats. Operations were performed on young rats aged 3 months and older rats aged 15 and 18 months, with survival times ranging from 6 to 15 months depending upon age {{at the time of}} operation. As in previous studies, axonal atrophy was found in myelinated fibres proximal to nerve transection. This was observed to be greater in animals operated upon at 3 months of age than in those in which the sciatic nerve was transected at 15 and 18 months. In the sciatic nerve, focal intramyelinic oedema was present at a low frequency <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> side just proximal to the section at all survival times but not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> unoperated side except in 1 old animal. Its frequency increased with age both in the dorsal and ventral roots on both sides but it was not more common <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> side. Retrograde axonal atrophy is therefore unlikely to contribute to its occurrence. In the dorsal root ganglia the main abnormality was the presence of vacuolated neurons <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> side. Nuclear eccentricity was also observed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> side in young animals in a proportion of the neurons; its frequency increased with age <b>on</b> <b>the</b> normal side and {{there was no difference in}} the older animals between operated and control sides. The possibility is discussed that growth factor deprivation secondary to axotomy is implicated in these changes. If so, there are age differences in its effect in giving rise to axonal atrophy and neuronal vacuolation...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount and}} {{direction}} of movement of the fibrous periosteum of the nasal, frontal, and parietal bones in the guinea-pig have been documented after experimentally induced unilateral paralysis of the masticatory muscles. Marked craniofacial asymmetries and muscle atrophy were observed after electrolytic lesions of the trigeminal motor nucleus were made. The induced muscle paralysis had only a small effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> periosteal migration. The direction of migration was slightly less medial <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> {{as compared to the}} non-operated side. The periosteal migration of the non-operated side closely paralleled the direction of movements observed in the control animals studied previously. There was an increase of bone apposition at the coronal sutural margins <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> side and an associated convexity of the midline toward <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> side. Additional research <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dynamic relationship of the muscle-periosteum-bone interface is necessary in order to understand better the morphogenetic controls of craniofacial growth...|$|R
5|$|That same year, Gygax was {{diagnosed}} with a potentially deadly abdominal aortic aneurysm. Doctors concurred that surgery was needed, but their estimates of success varied from 50% to 90%. With no firm medical consensus, Gygax came to believe that he would likely die <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> table; he refused to consider surgery, although he realized that a rupture of the aneurysm – likely inevitable – would be fatal. In one concession to his condition, he switched from cigarettes, which he had smoked since high school, to cigars.|$|E
5|$|Neil Rubenking of PC Magazine {{successfully}} {{installed the}} beta version on 12 malware-infected systems and commented on its small installation package (about 7 MB, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> system) and speedy installation. But the initial virus definition update took between 5 and 15 minutes, {{and the full}} installation occupied about 110 MB of disk space. Rubenking noted that the beta version sets Windows Update into fully automatic mode, although it can be turned off again through Windows Control Panel. Some full scans took {{more than an hour}} on infected systems; a scan on a clean system took 35 minutes. An on-demand scan test Rubenking conducted in June 2009 with the beta version found 89 percent of all malware samples: 30 percent of the commercial keyloggers, 67 percent of rootkits, but only half of the scareware samples. The product's real-time protection found 83 percent of all malware and blocked the majority of it: 40 percent of the commercial keyloggers and 78 percent of the rootkits were found.|$|E
5|$|On 7 June, the {{battleship}} received {{word that the}} Ranger battalion at Pointe Du Hoc was still isolated {{from the rest of}} the invasion force with low ammunition and mounting casualties; in response, Texas obtained and filled two LCVPs with provisions and ammunition for the Rangers. Upon their return, the LCVPs brought thirty-five wounded Rangers to Texas for treatment of which one died <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> table. Along with the Rangers, a deceased Coast Guard sailor and twenty-seven prisoners (twenty Germans, four Italians, and three French) were brought to the ship. The prisoners were fed, segregated, and not formally interrogated aboard Texas, due to the ship bombarding targets or standing by to bombard, before being loaded aboard an LST for transfer to England. Later in the day, her main battery rained shells on the enemy-held towns of Formigny and Trévières to break up German troop concentrations. That evening, she bombarded a German mortar battery that had been shelling the beach. Not long after midnight, German planes attacked the ships offshore, and one of them swooped in low on Texass starboard quarter. Her anti-aircraft batteries opened up immediately but failed to hit the intruder. On the morning of 8 June, her guns fired on Isigny, then on a shore battery, and finally on Trévières once more.|$|E
40|$|Implantation of silastic {{membranes}} between neural {{tube and}} somites at somitic levels 20 - 24 in 30 -somite-stage chick embryos results in separation of early migrated neural crest {{cells of the}} dorsal root ganglion (DRG) anlage from the neural tube and their death {{within a few hours}} [Kalcheim and Le Douarin, (1986) Dev. Biol., 116, 451 - 460]. The in vivo effects of brain-derived neutrotrophic factor (BNDF) on survival of HNK- 1 immunoreactive DRG cells separated from the tube were examined by implantation of laminin-treated silastic membranes (controls) or BDNF/laminin-treated membranes. In the presence of BDNF/laminin-treated membranes, 20 / 25 grafted embryos fixed 10 h after implantation, contained many rescued cells <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> side. In contrast, only a few rescued cells <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> side. In contrast, only a few rescued cells were observed in sections <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> in 2 / 11 embryos implanted with laminin-treated silastic membranes, and no rescued cells at all could be detected in embryos implanted with NGF/laminin-treated (seven embryos) or untreated silastic membranes (12 embryos). The data presented support the hypothesis that early survival and differentiation of neural crest-derived sensory cells depend on central nervous system-derived factor(s). Moreover, this is the first evidence for the in vivo activity of BDNF on survival of developing DRG cells...|$|R

5|$|To {{make the}} boot loader {{appealing}} to other operating system developers, Apple added features to allow {{flexibility in the}} booting process such as network boot using TFTP and load Mach-O and ELF formatted kernels. BootX can also boot from HFS, HFS+, UFS and ext2 formatted volumes. The boot loader can be manipulated at startup by holding down various key combinations to alter the booting process. Such functions include Verbose Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and V key at startup, which replaces the default Apple logo with text-based information on the boot process and Single User Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and S, which, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> system, may boot into a more basic command-line or text-based version of the operating system, to facilitate maintenance and recovery action. The ROM can also be set to require a password to access these technical functions using the OpenFirmware interface.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was designed to}} determine the change in cell numbers in the trigeminal ganglia following unilateral section {{of one of its}} peripheral branches. In 9 young adult cats, under general anesthesia, the inferior alveolar nerve was transected. In 3 of the animals the cut ends were reapposed and in the other 6 regeneration was blocked. After 15 weeks the trigeminal ganglia were removed, and the number of neurons present estimated by counting nucleoli in every third section. The counts were compared with those obtained from 3 unoperated control animals. The mean number of cells in the ganglia of control animals was 14, 324 with no statistically significant difference between sides. There {{was no significant difference between}} counts from opposite sides of cats whose nerves were allowed to regenerate. In the animals in which regeneration was prevented <b>the</b> mean count <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> side was 13, 874 and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> unoperated 18, 374. These differences were statistically significant and appeared to result from an increase in cell counts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> unoperated side rather than a reduction in <b>the</b> counts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> side. This may be explained by the presence of neurons with inconspicuous nucleoli in normal ganglia, which are stimulated to enlarge and become more prominent following peripheral nerve injury. This change could occur on both sides and would mask cell loss <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> side and produce an apparent increase in <b>the</b> count <b>on</b> <b>the</b> unoperated side...|$|R

40|$|The sinus nerve or {{sympathetic}} trunk was stimulated unilaterally in {{one group}} of adult cats or Syrian hamsters while in another group the sinus nerve or sympathetic trunk was cut unilaterally and the animals were given reserpine. In a third group, atropine was administered prior to sinus nerve stimulation. All tissues were processed {{for the detection of}} primary monoamines. <b>The</b> carotid bodies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> sides were compared with those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> unoperated sides of the same animal in order to determine if amine depletion occurred following the experimental procedures. After sinus nerve stimulation alone, the density of the granules in the glomus cells was decreased, but changes were not noted in the granules following sympathetic nerve stimulation. Sinus nerve stimulation after atropine administration resulted in no change in granule density. Sinus nerve transection followed by reserpine treatment resulted in a greater decrease in granule density <b>on</b> <b>the</b> unoperated than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> side. Transection of the sympathetic components to the carotid body followed by reserpine injections resulted in a decrease in granule density in <b>the</b> glomus cells <b>on</b> both <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> and unoperated sides. These results suggest that the sinus nerve must be intact for reserpine to exert an effect and that the sinus nerve may contain efferent fibers which modulate amine secretion...|$|R

40|$|Objectives:To study early haemodynamic {{changes in}} {{connection}} with carotid endarterectomy (CE). Methods:Sixty-three consecutive patients, average age 64, with symptomatic stenosis in the internal carotid artery (ICA) ≥ 70 % were examined clinically and by transcranial Doppler (TCD) 1 day before and within 48 h after CE. Duplex scanning of extracranial vessels was performed within 1 week after CE. Results:After CE, all retrograde systolic velocities (SV) in the ophthalmic artery (OA) and 9 / 10 retrograde mean velocities (MV) in the siphon changed to antegrade. Antegrade SV in the OA increased significantly (p< 0. 001) only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> side. SV in <b>the</b> OA <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> side correlated (p< 0. 05) with MV in the siphon, and pulsatility index (PI) in the middle cerebral artery (MCA, p< 0. 001). MV in the MCA increased from 46 ± 12 cm/s to 59 ± 21 cm/s after CE and in the ACA with normal flow from 54 ± 19 cm/s to 62 ± 28 cm/s (p< 0. 001 and < 0. 05, respectively) only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> side. Stump pressure correlated (p< 0. 01) with SV in the OA and PI in the MCA and was higher (59 ± 16 mmHg, p< 0. 01) in the group with antegrade flow in the OA compared to the group with retrograde flow in the OA (43 ± 15 mmHg).
