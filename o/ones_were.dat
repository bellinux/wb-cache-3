5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, the {{relationship}} between the two countries was well established. In the years after the war, the U.S. tested 1,100 compounds, and field trials of the more promising <b>ones</b> <b>were</b> done at British stations in India and Australia, in order to establish their effects in tropical conditions, as well as at the U.S.'s testing ground in Florida.|$|E

5|$|On the {{geographical}} division level, the Delegation had local offices, dividing Polish territories into 16 voivodeships, each under an underground voivode, further divided into powiats headed by starostas, and with separate municipal bodies. In early 1944, the Delegation employed some 15,000 people in its administration; those were primarily older people, as the younger <b>ones</b> <b>were</b> recruited {{for the military}} side of the operations.|$|E
5|$|Passing just to {{the south}} of the island, Hurricane Ivan {{produced}} strong winds in Grenada, with sustained winds reaching 120mph (195km/h) and gusts peaking at 133mph (215km/h) at Point Salines International Airport. The airport recorded 5.26inches (134mm) of precipitation during the hurricane's passage. Of the nation's six parishes, the four southernmost <b>ones</b> <b>were</b> most severely affected, constituting 80percent of the total population.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1970s day-release prisoners have {{assisted}} with {{maintenance of the}} cemetery grounds. In Australia's bicentennial year, 1988, a $16,000 grant was awarded for restoration work in the cemetery, at which time some broken gravestones were cemented together, and some illegible <b>ones</b> <b>were</b> 'cut back' and the letters repainted.|$|E

5|$|Constructed between 1870 and 1875 to {{meet the}} needs of Semarang's growing Catholic population, the red-brick church {{building}} was designed by the Dutch architect W. I. van Bakel and built at a cost of 110,000 gulden. The church grew extensively over the following fifty years, at first dominated by ethnic Europeans and persons of mixed descent but later having a majority indigenous congregation. As the Catholic population grew, the size of the parish diminished as new <b>ones</b> <b>were</b> established.|$|E
5|$|During World War II civil {{aerodromes}} {{were taken}} over for military use, existing military airfields were expanded, and new <b>ones</b> <b>were</b> built. This {{resulted in a}} significant inventory of facilities becoming available after the war. Pre-war civil aerodromes, for example Sywell, were returned to civilian use. Surplus military airfields were closed, and in some cases, for example Beccles, subsequently re-opened as civil aerodromes. The Ministry of Civil Aviation was created to regulate all civil aviation in the UK, and this task remained the responsibility of government departments until {{the establishment of the}} independent CAA in 1972.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, {{the monastery}} {{frequently}} lost and regained its ownership rights. On the funds of the monastery's new hegumen Afanasiy (a protégé of prince Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski), the monastery's old buildings were demolished, and new <b>ones</b> <b>were</b> built in their place. In 1604, the Gate Church of Ss. Peter and Paul was constructed, in 1609 - the Mykilska Refectory, and the Transfiguration Cathedral in 1609-1611. Under his rule, the monastery was considered {{as the second}} lavra (cave monastery) in Ukraine.|$|E
5000|$|Four 7"-8" [...] tall {{action figures}} were {{released}} by Amemiya's own Crowd, Inc., in 2000.

5|$|In 1900, Dunne {{moved to}} New York. Dooley's musings, since the war, had been entirely on affairs outside Chicago, with no Bridgeport columns, as Dunne needed {{to satisfy the}} demands of a {{national}} audience. In January 1900, just before he left the Journal, he wrote a Bridgeport piece, in which many of the earlier <b>ones</b> <b>were</b> recalled. This was the last Dooley piece written for a newspaper not to be syndicated; it appeared exclusively in the Journal.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, various {{companies}} were established to research subjects and provide practice tests to teams. Two {{of the major}} <b>ones</b> <b>were</b> Acalon Cards and Exams and DemiDec, formed by former coach Dan Spetner and former Decathlete Daniel Berdichevsky, respectively. The two offer exams and study guides that can augment or replace USAD's official materials. USAD explicitly discouraged teams from ordering materials from third-party companies in the late 1998, though it later removed their discouragement from the curriculum page. USAD republished their discouragement {{just a few weeks}} after removing it, but did not publish such a warning in 2002.|$|E
5|$|In the late-1930s it {{was decided}} to replace the pump and the centrepieces of the fountains. The new centrepieces, {{designed}} by Sir Edwin Lutyens, were memorials to Lord Jellicoe and Lord Beatty, although busts of the admirals, initially intended to be placed in the fountain surrounds were placed against the northern retaining wall when the project was completed after the Second World War. The fountains cost almost £50,000. The old <b>ones</b> <b>were</b> presented to the Canadian government and are now located in Ottawa's Confederation Park and Regina's Wascana Centre.|$|E

50|$|Three bridges over Kase Run {{were built}} in 1963. <b>One</b> <b>is</b> 36.1 ft long, <b>one</b> <b>is</b> 65.0 ft long, and <b>one</b> <b>is</b> 63.0 ft long. The latter two carry Interstate 80.|$|R
50|$|Two {{music videos}} were shot. The first <b>one</b> <b>was</b> shot with Angélica Rivera, {{while the second}} <b>one</b> <b>was</b> shot dancing in a bridge. The second <b>one</b> <b>was</b> {{included}} in Grandes Exitos Videos.|$|R
5|$|Increased wartime {{manufacturing}} and industrial growth {{ushered in a}} new era of economic prosperity and the rise of labor unions in the city. By 1880 Indianapolis was Indiana's commercial and industrial center. New industries in Indianapolis included pork-packing plants and foundries, as well as numerous manufacturers, small businesses, retail shops, and banks. In 1876 Colonel Eli Lilly opened a new pharmaceutical laboratory on Indianapolis's Pearl Street, founding what later became Eli Lilly and Company. The Union Railroad Transfer and Stock Yards Company, another major employer, opened in 1877. After the war, Indianapolis continued to develop into a transportation hub. Existing railroad lines expanded and new <b>ones</b> <b>were</b> established, linking Indianapolis to other cities across the nation.|$|E
5|$|Seddon {{thought that}} the church had once been much more elaborate, like the South doorway, and {{proposed}} inserting a matching West crossing arch, and also more a complex spire, but this was opposed by Bishop Basil Jones, and was abandoned. Seddon also proposed replacing all the roofs in a steeper pitch, thinking the existing <b>ones</b> <b>were</b> poor sixteenth century work. This was done, except that the fifteenth century chancel roof was retained between the new roof and the ceiling.|$|E
5|$|The Orjen {{class of}} eight motor torpedo boats {{was built for}} the Royal Yugoslav Navy between 1936 and 1939 at the Lürssen Shipyard. They {{were based on the}} German S-2 motor torpedo boats. At the start of the Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia, two boats managed to escape to Alexandria in Egypt where they continued serving with Allied forces, including in operations against Vichy French forces in Syria. The remaining <b>ones</b> <b>were</b> captured by Italian forces and commissioned in the Regia Marina (Royal Italian Navy) with modified armament; they were also used by the Italians as the model for the Italian-built CRDA 60 t motor torpedo boats.|$|E

For placement in state facilities, patients are initially evaluated and referred from local CSBs.|$|R
5|$|The queen {{shared the}} running of affairs of state with the king. The crown prince was {{involved}} in internal matters and the second prince was involved in foreign affairs. Most duties, including military <b>ones,</b> <b>were</b> handled by the vizier and the administration, which consisted of 13 court dignitaries—each of whom controlled between 400 and 800 men forming a bureaucracy with 11,700 people. Each of the four quarters of the lower city was governed by a chief inspector and many deputies. To oversee royal interest, the king employed agents (mashkim), collectors (ur) and messengers (kas).|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Amir's writings were published in Poedjangga Baroe, although some earlier <b>ones</b> <b>were</b> published in Timboel and Pandji Poestaka. None of his creative works are dated, {{and there is no}} consensus regarding when individual poems were written. However, there is a consensus that the works included in Nyanyi Sunyi were written after those included in Buah Rindu, despite the latter being published last. Johns writes that the poems in the collections appear to be arranged in chronological order; he points to the various degrees of maturity Amir showed as his writing developed.|$|E
5|$|Though {{a myriad}} of bones was {{available}} by 1969, many important <b>ones</b> <b>were</b> missing or hard to interpret. There were few postorbital skull elements, no femurs, no sacrum, no furcula or sternum, missing vertebrae, and (Ostrom thought) only a tiny fragment of a coracoid. Ostrom's skeletal reconstruction of Deinonychus included a very unusual pelvic bone– a pubis that was trapezoidal and flat, unlike that of other theropods, but which was the same length as the ischium and which was found right next to it.|$|E
