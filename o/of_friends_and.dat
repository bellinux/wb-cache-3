5|$|Some rulers {{handled this}} {{arrangement}} with less subtlety than others. Domitian {{was not so}} subtle. From the outset of his reign, he stressed the reality of his autocracy. He disliked aristocrats and had no fear of showing it, withdrawing every decision-making power from the Senate, and instead relying on a small set <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> equestrians to control the important offices of state.|$|E

5|$|Ao {{allegedly}} set up shell companies {{a network}} of secret bank accounts in Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands with the help <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> family members to launder bribe money. Ao's father Ao Veng-kong, brother Ao Man-fu, and sister-in-law Ao Chan Va-choi were charged with setting up overseas bank accounts and shell companies for Ao Man-long to handle kickbacks. The total deposits {{in more than a}} dozen Hong Kong bank accounts under his father's name exceeded HK$157 million as of December 2006. The three family members pleaded not guilty, claiming Ao Man-long opened the bank accounts for them. All family members were sentenced to prison terms by a decision of the Macau Court of Second Instance on 30 October 2008.|$|E

5|$|Before {{releasing}} the film, Madonna invited a group <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> co-workers {{to watch a}} rough three-hour cut of the film at a local theater in Notting Hill, and noted their feedback.

The documentary premiered on MTV in the United States, on October 21, 2005, at 10:00 PM. She also showed it to the film students at New York's Hunter College and appeared for a Q session. This promotion was a part of mtvU's Stand In series, in which celebrities filled in for college professors.|$|E
5|$|Buczynski welcomed {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> flatmates, {{including}} Geraci, into the Huntington coven, and later stated {{his desire to}} personally initiate Geraci up to the third degree; Saperton disagreed, citing the traditional Gardnerian prohibition on anyone initiating {{a member of the}} same sex. Buczynski thought that her attitude was homophobic, and subsequently abandoned both her and Gardnerian Wica. Meanwhile, he and Geraci moved out of their crowded apartment into a new flat in Middle Village. Despite same-sex marriage not being legally recognised at the time, they undertook a private wedding ceremony to marry one another, although were non-monogamous, and would go together to gay bath houses to partake in sexual activity with other patrons, resulting in Buczynski's contraction of several sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} that summer, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin {{reported}} that she was too frail to hold her birthday reception for the public, an annual tradition dating {{back to the days of}} the monarchy. As one of her last public appearances in September, she officially became a member of the American Red Cross. Following several months of deteriorating health that left her without the use of her lower limbs, as well as a diminished mental capacity rendering her incapable of recognizing her own house, her inner circle <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> caregivers sat vigil for the last two weeks of her life knowing the end was near. In accordance with Hawaiian tradition, the royal kāhili fanned her as she lay in bed. On the morning of November 11, Liliʻuokalani died at the age of seventy-nine at her residence at Washington Place.|$|E

As a proprietary colony, Penn governed Pennsylvania, yet its citizens were still subject to the English crown and laws. Penn's cousin William Markham served as the first colonial deputy governor.|$|E

Gaining compensation changed some families, whose members began to fight among themselves. Some descendants refused it, while others went into hiding to avoid the press <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> relatives who came asking for handouts. Some descendants, after dividing the funds among siblings, received not much more than $100 each. Later, the Florida Department of Education set up the Rosewood Family Scholarship Fund for Rosewood descendants and ethnic minorities.|$|E

Frank Vanderlip's sister Ruth was married to Harden; the families maintained close ties. After a year existing in two rooms of the Harden residence, the school moved to the River Gate House {{at the north end}} of River Road and the Beechwood estate.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Liz Friedlander and debuted on MTV's Total Request Live on March 7, 2000. It consists of performance footage of the trio in a warehouse {{in front of a}} wall decorated with photographs.

The final montage consists of personal photos from the band's past.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of our {{research}} was to study the representations of real personalities, who belong to a certain society or social stratum etc. The everyday representations <b>of</b> Enemy <b>and</b> <b>Friend</b> are formed within the everyday communication, and include the following components: Representations about the relation system <b>of</b> <b>Friend</b> <b>and</b> Enemy towards the Other; Representations <b>of</b> Enemy <b>and</b> <b>Friend's</b> appearance; Representations <b>of</b> the gender specific characteristics <b>of</b> Enemy <b>and</b> <b>Friend.</b> The study is aimed to define the impact of life-span stage on social-psychological content <b>of</b> representation about <b>Friend</b> <b>and</b> Enemy. The study is aimed to define the impact of life-span stage on social-psychological content <b>of</b> representation about <b>Friend</b> <b>and</b> Enemy. 500 participants at different life-span stages were interviewed with original structured interview. The results revealed several representation types. Representations about <b>Friend</b> <b>and</b> Enemy differ in 1) intensity {{of positive and negative}} attitudes towards others; 2) degree of negativity – positivity of other's appearance evaluation; 3) level of feminisation – masculinisation of others...|$|R

5|$|The {{starting}} point for the script was the ensemble cast <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> previous collaborators Jarmusch had conceived characters for, while the tripartite formal structure of the film was inspired by his study of literary forms. Cinematographer Robby Müller and musician John Lurie were among the many contributors who had been involved in earlier Jarmusch projects and returned to work on the film. Mystery Trains US$2.8 million budget (financed by Japanese conglomerate JVC) was considerable compared to what the director had enjoyed before, and allowed him the freedom to rehearse many unscripted background scenes. It was the first of Jarmusch's feature films to depart from his trademark black-and-white photography, though the use of color was tightly controlled to conform with the director's intuitive sense of the film's aesthetic.|$|E
5|$|This {{claim was}} {{rejected}} by Appian, who maintained that Octavian shared an equal interest with Lepidus and Antony in eradicating his enemies. Suetonius said that Octavian was reluctant to proscribe officials, but did pursue his enemies with more rigor than the other triumvirs. Plutarch described the proscriptions as a ruthless and cutthroat swapping <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> family among Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian. For example, Octavian allowed the proscription of his ally Cicero, Antony the proscription of his maternal uncle Lucius Julius Caesar (the consul of 64 BC), and Lepidus his brother Paullus.|$|E
5|$|Vernacular {{architecture}} {{of this period}} continued to dependent on local materials and styles. Often built by groups <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> family, {{the homes of the}} rural poor were usually of very simple construction. Contemporaries noted that cottages in the Highlands and Islands tended to be cruder, with single rooms, slit windows and earthen floors, often shared by a large family. In contrast many Lowland cottages had distinct rooms and chambers, were clad with plaster or paint and even had glazed windows. In the early 1800s urban settings also included traditional thatched houses, beside the larger, stone and slate roofed town houses of merchants and urban gentry.|$|E
