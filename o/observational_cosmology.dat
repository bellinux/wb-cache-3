25|$|Radio {{galaxies and}} their relatives, radio-loud quasars and blazars, are types of active galaxy {{that are very}} {{luminous}} at radio wavelengths, with luminosities up to 1039 W between 10MHz and 100GHz. The radio emission {{is due to the}} synchrotron process. The observed structure in radio emission is determined by the interaction between twin jets and the external medium, modified by the effects of relativistic beaming. The host galaxies are almost exclusively large elliptical galaxies. Radio-loud active galaxies can be detected at large distances, making them valuable tools for <b>observational</b> <b>cosmology.</b> Recently, much work has been done on the effects of these objects on the intergalactic medium, particularly in galaxy groups and clusters.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1990s, several {{developments}} in <b>observational</b> <b>cosmology,</b> especially {{the discovery of}} the accelerating universe from distant supernovae in 1998 (in addition to independent evidence from the cosmic microwave background and large galaxy redshift surveys), have shown that around 68% of the mass–energy density of the universe can be attributed to dark energy. While dark energy is poorly understood at a fundamental level, the main required properties of dark energy are that it functions as a type of anti-gravity, it dilutes much more slowly than matter as the universe expands, and it clusters much more weakly than matter, or perhaps not at all. The cosmological constant is the simplest possible form of dark energy since it is constant in both space and time, and this leads to the current standard model of cosmology known as the Lambda-CDM model, which provides a good fit to many cosmological observations.|$|E

500|$|In 1968 and 1970 Roger Penrose, Stephen Hawking, and George F. R.

Then, from the 1970s to the 1990s, cosmologists worked on characterizing {{the features of the}} Big Bang universe and resolving outstanding problems. In 1981, Alan Guth made a breakthrough in theoretical work on resolving certain outstanding theoretical problems in the Big Bang theory with the introduction of an epoch of rapid expansion in the early universe he called [...] "inflation". Meanwhile, during these decades, two questions in <b>observational</b> <b>cosmology</b> that generated much discussion and disagreement were over the precise values of the Hubble Constant and the matter-density of the universe (before the discovery of dark energy, thought to be the key predictor for the eventual fate of the universe).|$|E
2500|$|Although the Standard Model is {{believed}} to be theoretically self-consistent and has demonstrated huge successes in providing experimental predictions, it leaves some phenomena unexplained and falls short of being a complete theory of fundamental interactions. It does not fully explain baryon asymmetry, incorporate the full theory of gravitation as described by general relativity, or account for the accelerating expansion of the Universe as possibly described by dark energy. [...] The model does not contain any viable dark matter particle that possesses all of the required properties deduced from <b>observational</b> <b>cosmology.</b> It also does not incorporate neutrino oscillations and their non-zero masses.|$|E

40|$|From an <b>observational</b> {{perspective}} <b>cosmology</b> {{is today}} in excellent shape - advances in instrumentation and data processing have {{enabled us to}} study the universe in detail back to when the first galaxies formed, map the fluctuations in {{the cosmic microwave background}} which provide a measure of the overall geometry, and reconstruct the thermal history reliably back to at least the primordial nucleosynthesis era. However recent deep studies of the Hubble expansion rate have suggested that the universe is accelerating, driven by some form of `dark' (vacuum) energy. If true, this implies a new energy scale in Nature of order 0. 001 eV, well below any known scale of fundamental physics. This has refocussed attention on the notorious cosmological constant problem at the interface of general relativity and quantum field theory. It is possible that the resolution of this situation will require fundamental modifications to our ideas about gravity.

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{inflation}} {{was introduced to}} resolve many existing <b>observational</b> problems in <b>cosmology.</b> Inflation becomes eternal when a region of space continuously spawns non-inflation regions.

In this thesis, we explored the idea that a universe can be born via a collision between two bubble universes. This process is known as a ``Classical Transition''.
