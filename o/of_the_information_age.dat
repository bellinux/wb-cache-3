25|$|With {{the advent}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Age</b> {{at the end}} of the 20th century, modern humans live in a world that has become {{increasingly}} globalized and interconnected. As of 2010, almost 2billion humans are able to communicate with each other via the Internet, and 3.3 billion by mobile phone subscriptions. Although interconnection between humans has encouraged the growth of science, art, discussion, and technology, it has also led to culture clashes and the development and use of weapons of mass destruction. Human civilization has led to environmental destruction and pollution significantly contributing to the ongoing mass extinction of other forms of life called the Holocene extinction event,* which may be further accelerated by global warming in the future.|$|E

Architect Philip Hooker's Federal style design is the city's oldest public building, and the less altered of his two intact non-residential buildings in the city.

25|$|Gene {{nomenclature}} is {{the scientific}} naming of genes, the units of heredity in living organisms. An international committee published recommendations for genetic symbols and nomenclature in 1957. The {{need to develop}} formal guidelines for human gene names and symbols was recognized in the 1960s and full guidelines were issued in 1979 (Edinburgh Human Genome Meeting). Several other genus-specific research communities (e.g., Drosophila fruit flies, Mus mice) have adopted nomenclature standards, as well, and have published them on the relevant model organism websites and in scientific journals, including the Trends in Genetics Genetic Nomenclature Guide. Scientists familiar with a particular gene family may work together to revise the nomenclature for the entire set of genes when new information becomes available. For many genes and their corresponding proteins, an assortment of alternate names is in use across the scientific literature and public biological databases, posing a challenge to effective organization and exchange of biological information. Standardization of nomenclature thus tries to achieve the benefits of vocabulary control and bibliographic control, although adherence is voluntary. The advent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>age</b> has brought gene ontology, which in some ways is a next step of gene nomenclature, because it aims to unify the representation of gene and gene product attributes across all species.|$|E

[...] In Pattern Recognition, the plot revolves around snippets of film footage posted anonymously to various locations on the Internet. Characters in the novel speculate about the filmmaker's identity, motives, methods and inspirations on several websites, anticipating the 2006 lonelygirl15 internet phenomenon. However, Gibson later disputed the notion that the creators of lonelygirl15 drew influence from him. Another phenomenon anticipated by Gibson is the rise of reality television, for example in Virtual Light, which featured a satirical extrapolated version of COPS.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, two authors have {{introduced}} new variables into Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital. Emmison & Frow's (1998) work centers on {{an exploration of}} the ability of Information Technology to be considered a form of cultural capital. The authors state that [...] "a familiarity with, and a positive disposition towards the use of bourgeoisie technologies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>age</b> can be seen as an additional form of cultural capital bestowing advantage on those families that possess them". Specifically computers are [...] "machines" [...] (Bourdieu, 1986:47) that form a type of objectified cultural capital, and the ability to use them is an embodied type of cultural capital. This work is useful because it shows the ways in which Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital can be expanded and updated to include cultural goods and practices which are progressively more important in determining achievement both in the school and without.|$|E
