5|$|On 8 July 2009, a {{temporary}} Amigo convenience store {{opened in the}} BB Building on the campus, replacing the previous <b>One</b> <b>Stop</b> store which was situated near the library. The new store is operated by the Compass Group, and will see the University enjoy 'guaranteed rental income and share of turnover'. The project is part of wider work which saw a new building, housing a larger shop and library extension, which opened on the <b>One</b> <b>Stop</b> site in April 2011.|$|E
5|$|Hillsboro Central/Southeast 3rd Avenue Transit Center is a {{light rail}} station and transit center on the MAX Blue Line in Hillsboro, Oregon. Opened in 1998, the red-brick station is the 19th stop {{westbound}} on the Westside MAX, <b>one</b> <b>stop</b> from the western terminus of the line. Physically the largest station on the line, it is located at a former stop of the Oregon Electric Railway and includes artwork honoring {{the history of the}} community.|$|E
5|$|The Brook Avenue station {{just east}} of Third Avenue–138th Street on the IRT Pelham Line would be reconstructed to allow a {{cross-platform}} interchange. Further north, {{there would be a}} connection with the IRT Pelham Line near Westchester Avenue at the Whitlock Avenue station, and station platforms north to Pelham Bay Park would be narrowed and lengthened to accommodate the longer and wider B Division trains from the Second Avenue Subway. IRT local service on the Pelham Line would terminate at Hunts Point Avenue <b>one</b> <b>stop</b> south.|$|E

5|$|Until December 2001, {{this was}} the second-to-last stop of the line, which {{terminated}} <b>one</b> <b>stop</b> east at 21st Street–Queensbridge. In 2001 the 63rd Street Tunnel Connection opened, allowing trains from the IND Queens Boulevard Line to use the line. Since {{the opening of the}} connection, the line has been served by F trains, and the subway then became the second means for direct travel between the island and Queens, supplementing the buses that had been operating over the Roosevelt Island Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The tram {{station is}} served by lines 11, 12 and 13 of the Oslo Tramway. Southbound, all three follow the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line to the city center. Travel time to Kirkeristen is 15 minutes. Northwards, line 11 and 12 {{continue}} on the Kjelsås Line. Both run to Kjelsås outside rush hour, but during peak services, line 12 terminates at the next station, Disen. Line 13 branches off and heads <b>one</b> <b>stop</b> to Grefsen. The tram service is provided by Oslo Sporvognsdrift on contract with Ruter. Storo is one of eight transfer points between the tramway and rapid transit systems.|$|E
5|$|While in Kuwait, Manning {{was placed}} on suicide watch after her {{behavior}} caused concern. She was moved from Kuwait to the Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, on July 29, 2010, and classified as a maximum custody detainee with Prevention of Injury (POI) status. POI status is <b>one</b> <b>stop</b> short of suicide watch, entailing checks by guards every five minutes. Her lawyer, David Coombs, a former military attorney, said Manning {{was not allowed to}} sleep between 5 am (7 am on weekends) and 8 pm, and was made to stand or sit up if she tried to. She was required to remain visible at all times, including at night, which entailed no access to sheets, no pillow except one built into her mattress, and a blanket designed not to be shredded. Manning complained that she regarded it as pretrial punishment.|$|E

5|$|At <b>one</b> <b>stop</b> on {{the book}} tour {{associated}} with the publication and release of the book at the David A. Clarke School of Law of the University of the District of Columbia, Jackson's message was perceived as saying that American history can be studied as an analysis of race, but that economics and the tension between states’ rights and federal rights are the true basis of a domestic history revolving around pursuit of economic development, political power, and personal freedom. He then advanced the theory that these pursuits would most be most readily attained by adopting a set of new constitutional amendments, guaranteeing rights primarily grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the U.S. has ratified. Each is discussed in a separate chapter: the rights to quality health care, housing, education, a clean environment, fair taxes, full employment, equality for women, {{and the right to}} vote.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1949, King married divorceé Anita Leslie (Anita Theodosia Moira Rodzianko King 1914–1984). She was {{the eldest}} child of Sir John Randolph Shane Leslie, 3rd Baronet {{and his wife}} Marjorie Ide, the Vermont-born {{daughter}} of the US ambassador to Spain. Bill and Anita probably met in Lebanon in 1943, where King served for 5 months as {{executive officer of the}} submarine base at Beirut. She was on a skiing trip after doing duty in Africa in the Motor Transport Corps in 1940–42, although a letter mentions her being in Beirut in 1941–42. Leslie-King then became an ambulance driver in the French Army from 1944 to 1945. For the latter, she was awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1945 by General Charles de Gaulle. As Anita Leslie, she wrote over a dozen books, including Love in a Nutshell (1952), The Remarkable Mr. Jerome: The Life and Times of Leonard Jerome, Sir Winston Churchill's American Grandfather (1954). In 1974 she wrote the biography of Francis Chichester, the first person to sail around the world single-handedly with only <b>one</b> <b>stop.</b> The Kings had two children, Richard Tarka Bourke King (b. 1949), and Leonie Rose King (b. 1951).|$|E
5|$|On 6 April 1914, the CCE (now {{a part of}} the Northern line) {{opened a}} <b>one</b> <b>stop</b> {{extension}} south from its terminus at Charing Cross. The extension was constructed to facilitate a better interchange between the BS and CCE Both lines were owned by the UERL which operated two separate and unconnected stations at the northern end of main line station – Trafalgar Square on the BS and Charing Cross on the CCE (both now part of a combined Charing Cross station). The CCE extension was constructed as a single track tunnel running south from Charing Cross as a loop under the River Thames and back. A single platform was constructed on the northbound return section of the loop, and escalators were installed between both sets of deep-level platforms and the sub-surface station. The interchange time was reduced from three minutes fifteen seconds to one minute and forty-five seconds.|$|E

5|$|Pioneer Square {{station is}} part of the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel and is located <b>one</b> <b>stop</b> {{northbound}} of its southern terminus, International District/Chinatown station, and three stops southbound of its northern terminus, Convention Place station. The tunnel is also part of Sound Transit's Central Link line, which runs from the University of Washington campus to Downtown Seattle, the Rainier Valley and Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. Pioneer Square is the eleventh northbound station from Angle Lake station and fourth southbound station from University of Washington station, situated between International District/Chinatown and University Street stations. Central Link trains serve Pioneer Square 20 hours a day on weekdays and Saturdays, from 5:00am to 1:00am, and 18 hours on Sundays, from 6:00am to 12:00am; during regular weekday service, trains operate roughly every 6 to 10 minutes during rush hour and midday operation, respectively, with longer headways of 15 minutes in the early morning and 20 minutes at night. During weekends, Central Link trains arrive at Pioneer Square station every 10 minutes during midday hours and every 15 minutes during mornings and evenings. The station is approximately 33 minutes from SeaTac/Airport station and five minutes from Westlake station.|$|E
5|$|Several {{stations}} {{along the}} line also have provisions for other extensions {{as part of the}} IND Second System. The Roosevelt Avenue station has an additional upper level platform and bellmouth provisions east of the station, which would have gone to a Queens crosstown line to the Rockaways. The 63rd Drive station has similar bellmouths, which would have fed directly into the inactive portion of the Long Island Rail Road's former Rockaway Beach Branch near its former junction with the LIRR Main Line (Whitepot Junction). <b>One</b> <b>stop</b> west, the Woodhaven Boulevard station has provisions to be converted into an express station. East of the Briarwood station, there were additional trackways built for an extension down Van Wyck Boulevard (today the Van Wyck Expressway) to Rockaway Boulevard, near the current site of John F. Kennedy International Airport. None of these proposals were ever funded, and only the Briarwood bellmouths were used for future expansion, while the Rockaway line was connected instead to the IND Fulton Street Line.|$|E
5|$|Variety and realism were focuses for the tracks: they {{featured}} visuals such as forests, Neon Cities, and Canyons, {{complete with}} obstacles. The team travelled {{to photograph the}} textures. The tracks were constructed in Softimage 3D and converted to PlayStation format mesh data using a custom tool. In response to a common criticism of the original Destruction Derby, the tracks were designed to be larger and less narrow. The team were inspired by Daytonas revolving windmills, and large jumps were implemented to add drama to the tracks. The most realistic aspect of the race tracks was the pit stop, although Edmondson stated that he limited players to <b>one</b> <b>stop</b> because the team {{did not want to}} detract from the action and because a penalty system would have added a lot of extra work. Cars nearing destruction were designed to behave in a realistic and unpredicatable fashion through effects such as losing the bonnet (hood) and catching on fire.|$|E

5|$|Häkkinen {{retired from}} the race when he slowed and later pulled {{to the side of}} the track with fluid leaking from his engine on lap 14. His {{retirement}} allowed Räikkonen to move into the first points-scoring position of sixth. By lap 15, Montoya had a lead of 8.3 seconds over Ralf Schumacher, who in turn was 3.3 seconds in front of Barrichello. Michael Schumacher was a further 9.2 seconds behind his Ferrari teammate, but was drawing ahead of Coulthard in fifth. Barrichello and Panis were the first drivers to make scheduled pit stops on lap 16. The Ferrari and Williams teams were employing different pit stop strategies – the Ferrari were planning a two stop strategy for Barrichello whereas the Williams team were only planning for <b>one</b> <b>stop.</b> Räikkonen slowed on track with an driveshaft failure but managed to return to the pit lane and retire on the same lap, while Irvine retired with an misfiring engine. Two laps later, Burti lost tenth position after he spun and was passed by Trulli and Panis. Barrichello attempted to get past Coulthard for fourth position on lap 19, but Coulthard moved onto a defensive line to keep the position. Montoya continued to pull away from Ralf Schumacher—setting the race's fastest lap of 1:41.808 on lap 20—to maintain his first position after his one and only pit stop. Barrichello was able to overtake Coulthard at the Agip corner on the same lap.|$|E
5|$|The final race in Europe {{took place}} at Monza. Ferrari's early bid to put Fernando Alonso on pole {{position}} by way of using Felipe Massa to offer him a slipstream ended in disaster when Alonso's rear anti-roll bar failed in the final period of qualifying, leaving the championship leader marooned in tenth while Lewis Hamilton took pole. Hamilton asserted early control over the race, and while Ferrari made significant ground early on to be running second and third – despite losing the data uplink between their cars and the pit wall that provided them with telemetry – it was Sergio Pérez who proved to be Hamilton's biggest challenge. Starting outside the top ten, Pérez elected to start on the harder compound tyres and complete <b>one</b> <b>stop,</b> producing fastest lap after fastest lap as McLaren's confidence was broken when Jenson Button's car was paralysed by a fuel pressure problem. Hamilton would ultimately prevail, but {{he was forced to}} push in the final few laps to maintain his lead, and won the race by four seconds as Pérez claimed his third podium of the season with second place. Alonso went on to finish third, benefiting from Button's retirement and a drive-through penalty for Sebastian Vettel when the reigning World Champion forced him so wide through the Curva Grande that Alonso was forced off the circuit. Bruno Senna later criticised the race stewards for not penalising Paul di Resta for a similar altercation on the approach to the Variante della Roggia early in the race. Meanwhile, with Romain Grosjean serving his suspension, Lotus enlisted former Marussia F1 driver Jérôme d'Ambrosio as their second driver for the weekend. He qualified sixteenth, and went on to finish thirteenth overall.|$|E
