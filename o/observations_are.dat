5|$|All {{observation}} involves both {{perception and}} cognition. That is, {{one does not}} make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, <b>observations</b> <b>are</b> affected by one's underlying understanding {{of the way in}} which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, it can be argued that all observation is theory-laden.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{possibility is}} that 55 Cancri e is a solid planet made of carbon-rich material rather than the oxygen-rich material that makes up the terrestrial planets in our solar system. In this case, roughly {{a third of the}} planet's mass would be carbon, much of which may be in the form of diamond {{as a result of the}} temperatures and pressures in the planet's interior.

5|$|Gamma ray telescopes {{collect and}} measure individual, high energy gamma rays from astrophysical sources. These are {{absorbed by the}} atmosphere, {{requiring}} that <b>observations</b> <b>are</b> done by high-altitude balloons or space missions. Gamma rays can be generated by supernovae, neutron stars, pulsars and black holes. Gamma ray bursts, with extremely high energies, have also been detected but {{have yet to be}} identified.|$|E
5|$|Ground {{temperature}} measurements, {{like most}} weather <b>observations,</b> <b>are</b> logged by location. Their siting predates the massive sprawl, roadbuilding programs, and high- and medium-rise expansions which {{contribute to the}} UHI. More importantly, station logs allow sites in question to be filtered easily from data sets. Doing so, the presence of heat islands is visible, but overall trends change in magnitude, not direction.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the FAA {{mandates}} {{the taking}} of weather observations at larger airports for safety reasons. To help facilitate the purchase of an automated airport weather station, such as ASOS, the FAA allows federal dollars {{to be used for}} the installation of certified weather stations at airports. The airport <b>observations</b> <b>are</b> then transmitted worldwide using the METAR observing code. METAR reports typically come from airports or permanent weather observation stations. Reports are generated once an hour; however, if conditions change significantly, they may be updated in special reports called SPECIs.|$|E
50|$|Direct <b>observation</b> methods involve <b>is</b> {{present to}} observe and record the problem {{behavior}} as it occurs. The goal of direct <b>observation</b> <b>is</b> to record the immediate antecedent and consequences that functions with the problem behavior within a natural environment. The main advantage of direct <b>observation</b> <b>is</b> that the antecedents and consequences are recorded as it happens instead of recollection of memory. Therefore, the information recorded is generally more accurate. The main disadvantage of direct <b>observation</b> <b>is</b> it requires {{a considerable amount of}} time and effort to implement. Another thing about direct <b>observation</b> <b>is,</b> like indirect methods, it can only demonstrate a correlation but not a functional relationship.|$|R
3000|$|... is the {{probabilistic}} {{representation of}} the observation model defined in Equation (6). When the object is within the observable region, a positive <b>observation</b> <b>is</b> obtained and the <b>observation</b> likelihood <b>is</b> a probability density function given the current of the object observation.

For example, a photo from 1 January 2001 shows Mount Cleveland, Alaska, with a plume of smoke, prior to its eruption the following month. On 23 January 2001, the crew observed a unique perspective of a plume of volcanic ash coming from Popocatépetl, an active volcano 70 kilometres southeast of Mexico City.|$|E
5|$|Lutetium metal is {{slightly}} unstable in air at standard conditions, but it burns readily at 150°C to form lutetium oxide. The resulting compound {{is known to}} absorb water and carbon dioxide, and {{may be used to}} remove vapors of these compounds from closed atmospheres. Similar <b>observations</b> <b>are</b> made during reaction between lutetium and water (slow when cold and fast when hot); lutetium hydroxide is formed in the reaction. Lutetium metal is known to react with the four lightest halogens to form trihalides; all of them (except the fluoride) are soluble in water.|$|E

25|$|A photon {{climbing}} in Earth's {{gravitational field}} loses energy and is redshifted. Early attempts to measure this redshift through astronomical <b>observations</b> <b>were</b> somewhat inconclusive, but definitive laboratory <b>observations</b> <b>were</b> performed by Pound & Rebka (1959) {{and later by}} Pound & Snider (1964).|$|R
5|$|With {{advent of}} {{automated}} telescopes {{and improvements in}} spectroscopes, a number of collaborations {{have been made to}} map the Universe in redshift space. By combining redshift with angular position data, a redshift survey maps the 3D distribution of matter within a field of the sky. These <b>observations</b> <b>are</b> used to measure properties of the large-scale structure of the Universe. The Great Wall, a vast supercluster of galaxies over 500 million light-years wide, provides a dramatic example of a large-scale structure that redshift surveys can detect.|$|E
5|$|Xenon {{can also}} form endohedral {{fullerene}} compounds, where a xenon atom is trapped inside a fullerene molecule. The xenon atom {{trapped in the}} fullerene can be observed by 129Xe nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Through the sensitive chemical shift of the xenon atom to its environment, chemical reactions on the fullerene molecule can be analyzed. These <b>observations</b> <b>are</b> not without caveat, however, because the xenon atom has an electronic influence on the reactivity of the fullerene.|$|E
5|$|A common {{justification}} for the need for astronomy {{is the need to}} develop an accurate calendar for agricultural reasons. Ancient texts like Hesiod's Works and Days, an ancient farming manual, would appear to contradict this. Instead astronomical <b>observations</b> <b>are</b> used in combination with ecological signs, such as bird migrations to determine the seasons. Ethnoastronomical work with the Mursi of Ethiopia shows that haphazard astronomy continued until recent times {{in some parts of the}} world. All the same, calendars appear to be an almost universal phenomenon in societies as they provide tools for the regulation of communal activities.|$|E

5|$|Analyses {{conducted}} contemporarily and independently by Bailey, Batygin and Brown; by Gomes, Deienno and Morbidelli; {{and later}} by Lai suggest that Planet Nine could be responsible for inducing the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System. The Sun's axis of rotation is tilted approximately six degrees from the orbital plane of the giant planets. The exact reason for this discrepancy {{remains an open question}} in astronomy. The analysis used computer simulations to show that both the magnitude and direction of tilt {{can be explained by the}} gravitational torques exerted by Planet Nine on the other planets over the lifetime of the Solar System. These <b>observations</b> <b>are</b> consistent with the Planet Nine hypothesis, but do not prove that Planet Nine exists, as there could be some other reason, or more than one reason, for the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Few {{official}} surface <b>observations</b> <b>are</b> {{available for}} {{the passage of the}} hurricane. Upon making landfall, Kenna was accompanied with an estimated 16foot (4.9m) storm surge in San Blas. The surge also affected Puerto Vallarta, with reports of 10foot (3m) waves rushing inland from the bay. The hurricane dropped about 1.38inches (35mm) of precipitation while passing about 60mi (95km) east of the offshore archipelago, Islas Marías. There, sustained winds reached an estimated 106mph (170km/h). On land, Kenna dropped heavy rainfall peaking at 18.91inches (480mm) at San Ignacio, Sinaloa, and 12.89inches (327mm) near Manzanillo, Colima. The highest recorded sustained wind on land was about 100mph (161km/h) at Tepic, Nayarit, with wind gusts at Puerto Vallarta reaching 50mph (80km/h). The hurricane also produced heavy rainfall in Guerrero, Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco, and hit Baja California Sur with strong winds and rough seas.|$|E
5|$|Intense {{tropical}} cyclones pose {{a particular}} observation challenge, {{as they are}} a dangerous oceanic phenomenon, and weather stations, being relatively sparse, are rarely available {{on the site of}} the storm itself. In general, surface <b>observations</b> <b>are</b> available only if the storm is passing over an island or a coastal area, or if there is a nearby ship. Real-time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone, where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated. For this reason, there are teams of meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength at the point of landfall.|$|E

More clearly, 3023 <b>observations</b> <b>were</b> used and divided among mentioned sub-datasets (i.e., 1813 <b>observations</b> <b>were</b> assigned to the training sub-dataset, 906 <b>observations</b> <b>were</b> assigned to the validation sub-dataset, and 302 <b>observations</b> <b>were</b> assigned to the testing sub-dataset). In addition, the maximum tree depth of 10, which is suitable considering the number of variables, was selected.

5|$|Kepler-6b {{is a hot}} Jupiter, {{having a}} mass 0.669 times that of Jupiter, but an average {{distance}} of only 0.046 AU from its star and, thus, an orbital period of 3.23 days. It is almost 10 times closer to its star than Mercury is from our Sun. As a result, Kepler-6b is strongly irradiated by its star, heating its atmosphere to a temperature of 1660 K and puffing {{it up to a}} size 1.3 times that of Jupiter. It may also be the case that Kepler-6b has a thermal inversion of its atmosphere, where temperature increases with increasing distance {{from the center of the}} planet. However, additional <b>observations</b> <b>are</b> required to confirm or refute this possibility.|$|E
5|$|Kuhn {{denied that}} it is ever {{possible}} to isolate the hypothesis being tested from {{the influence of the}} theory in which the <b>observations</b> <b>are</b> grounded, and he argued {{that it is}} not possible to evaluate competing paradigms independently. More than one logically consistent construct can paint a usable likeness of the world, but there is no common ground from which to pit two against each other, theory against theory. Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. Neither provides a standard by which the other can be judged, so there is no clear way to measure scientific progress across paradigms.|$|E
5|$|Populations {{of stars}} have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are {{observed}} {{as they were}} in the early universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently, appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These <b>observations</b> <b>are</b> strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of star formation, galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.|$|E
