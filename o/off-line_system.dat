5000|$|The e-project ADLN was {{the first}} step to develop an {{e-learning}} community in Armenia and form a positive attitude towards the phenomenon. First e-course implemented by ADLN was entitled “Electronic Commerce”. The course materials were based on the first e-commerce book in Armenian Language “E-commerce” (2004) written by Albert Poghosyan. Fifty participants from all over Armenia were involved in the course, which offered also after course consultation opportunities if the participants express a desire to develop their own e-projects. After the graduation, the participants received a certificate together with the upper mentioned book. The second e-course that attracted more than 150 participants was entitled “Electronic Marketing” (2006). ADLN had 60 graduates that completed the whole learning and assessment process. The third e-course entitled “PR in the new era of communication” {{is in the process of}} development. All courses are conducted only in Armenian, thus the course development and adaptation process is considered to be of high importance. The system is connected to the Armenian Electronic Payment System - EDram, as well as international on-line & credit card payment systems thus the users are able to register both - on-line and <b>off-line.</b> <b>System</b> tools of the ADLN system are: ...|$|E

The model allows us to study the global behaviour of the system without introducing external forms of recompense. Using game-theory and equitable multicriteria optimization, we study three diverse types of computational grids: an <b>off-line</b> <b>system</b> with dedi-cated uniprocessors, an on-line system with divisible load and an <b>off-line</b> <b>system</b> with parallel jobs. Results show that, unless strong assumptions are made, the complete decentralization leads to a significant loss of performance...|$|E

Beside the classical use of the off-line features, we add the use of on-line features and the combination of the developed systems. The designed recognizer is implemented using the HMM-Toolkit.
