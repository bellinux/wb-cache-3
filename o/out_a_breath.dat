40|$|Approximately Men is {{the first}} section of a novel. It explores queer masculinities, femininities, and the liminal spaces that foster self-actualization. The voice in this piece {{attempts}} to reconcile the individual with the expectations of that individual, and does its best to not intervene. The following is an excerpt: “You know,” Andrew said before letting <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> of smoke. “I really do like Kerouac. He spends pages just listing the things he sees, like rotting peanut butter and empty boxes of Tide detergent. I can’t imagine those were fun bits to read at the time he wrote them, but they’re so interesting now, a few generations later, thinking of what trash surrounded people so long ago. I want to live my life with his awareness. Nicholas might be right that we all just try to live out other people’s great stories, but I can’t bring myself to believe that’s bad. Sometimes in order to have an exciting day, you just have to convince yourself to perceive it that way. I don’t think it’s a crime for us to take a shitty life and convince ourselves it’s amazing. ” Ethan took the joint from Andrew’s hand, and then slipped his free hand into Andrew’s and sucked a mouthful of adventure into his lungs as he sat on a warm rock and felt the hairs on the insides of his thighs start to crisp and stopped thinking about his place in the world, letting just enough room into his mind for him to think instead about the things in life that exist only for a moment but last so much longer before he let go of Andrew’s hand and lay his own across his naked lap...|$|E

60|$|He spent {{ten minutes}} {{covering}} {{a distance of}} twenty yards, and, on opening the door, was greeted {{by one of the}} company, who had evidently come <b>out</b> for <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> of fresh air.|$|R
60|$|Kells purled <b>out</b> <b>a</b> {{suspended}} <b>breath</b> and {{he flung}} {{the sweat from}} his brow. There was about him, perhaps more than the others, a dark realization of how close the call had been for Pearce.|$|R
60|$|The hero {{threw the}} dole {{on the bedroom}} floor, and in a speech bristling with personalities, {{consigned}} the committee to perdition.

60|$|And {{the high}} candles on the {{littered}} desk flickered and went <b>out,</b> as though <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> had blown them, first {{one and then}} the other.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{carry your}} mind back to last night," [...] he began. [...] "You {{remember}} my going <b>out</b> to get <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> of fresh air. Can you guess what that meant?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Put an {{arm through}} mine, sir," [...] he begged him gently but firmly. [...] "No use giving the game away.

5000|$|After {{seeing a}} Setsuko Hara film, the novelist Shūsaku Endō wrote: [...] "We would sigh or let <b>out</b> <b>a</b> great <b>breath</b> {{from the depths}} of our hearts, for what we felt was {{precisely}} this: Can it be possible {{that there is such a}} woman in this world?" ...|$|R

60|$|Towards midnight, I went {{round the}} house to lock up, {{accompanied}} by my second in command (Samuel, the footman), as usual. When all the doors were made fast, except the side door that opened on the terrace, I sent Samuel to bed, and stepped <b>out</b> for <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> of fresh air before I too went to bed in my turn.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{let us go}} <b>out</b> and get <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> of air by the river-side. Come! {{take your}} hood and fan--it is getting dark--nobody will see us, and we can come back here, if you like, in half an hour." ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{ancient times}} {{freediving}} {{without the aid}} of mechanical devices was the only possibility, {{with the exception of the}} occasional use of reeds and leather breathing bladders. The divers faced the same problems as divers today, such as decompression sickness and blacking <b>out</b> during <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> hold. Freediving was practiced in ancient cultures to gather food, harvest resources such as sponge and pearl, reclaim sunken valuables, and to help aid military campaigns.|$|R
60|$|Ginger Dick {{sat down}} agin, {{and when the}} murder was over 'e said it made 'im feel faint, and 'im and Peter Russet went <b>out</b> for <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> of fresh air. They 'ad three at the first place, and then they moved on to another and forgot all about Isaac and the {{dissolving}} views until ten o'clock, when Ginger, who 'ad been very liberal to some friends 'e'd made in a pub, found 'e'd spent 'is last penny.|$|R
60|$|Soon {{afterwards}} Joseph {{came in with}} a message. If {{there was}} no immediate necessity for his presence in the bedchamber, Mr. Engelman would go <b>out</b> to get <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> of fresh air, before he retired for the night. There was no necessity for his presence; and I sent a message downstairs to that effect.|$|R
60|$|The {{sun went}} down; the {{twilight}} shadows {{fell over the}} dreary square; the gas lamps were lighted far and near; {{people who had been}} <b>out</b> for <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> of fresh air in the fields, came straggling past me by ones and twos, on their way home--and still I lingered near the house, hoping she might come to the window again; but she did not re-appear. At last, a servant brought candles into the room, and drew down the Venetian blinds. Knowing it would be useless to stay longer, I left the square.|$|R
6000|$|Johnny obeyed; {{and when}} he paused, <b>out</b> of <b>breath,</b> <b>a</b> small hand came through the hole, {{grasping}} as many lilies of the valley as it could hold, and the Princess graciously expressed her pleasure by saying,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! no,' said Mr. Devereux, 'I am only <b>a</b> little <b>out</b> of <b>breath.</b> <b>A</b> terrible {{report came}} to me, and I {{set off to}} learn the truth. I should like to hear what Mr. Saunders says of her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{soon as the}} {{questioning}} was over, I made the first excuse that came into my head, and got leave to go <b>out</b> for <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> of fresh air. I went straight to Cobb's Hole, to Mr. Yolland's cottage. His wife and daughter were the best friends I had. Don't suppose I trusted them with your secret--I have trusted nobody. All I wanted was to write this letter to you, {{and to have a}} safe opportunity of taking the nightgown off me. Suspected as I was, I could do neither of those things with any sort of security, at the house.|$|R
60|$|He still professed {{a desire}} to do so when the curtain fell, and they hurried to the rear door of the theatre. It was {{slightly}} ajar, and they pulled it wide open, with the eagerness of their age and nation, and began to mount the stairs leading up from it between rows of painted dancing-girls, who had come <b>out</b> for <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> of air, and who pressed themselves against the walls {{to make room for}} the intruders. With their rouged faces, and the stare of their glassy eyes intensified by the coloring of their brows and lashes, they were like painted statues, as they stood there with their crimsoned lips parted in astonished smiles.|$|R

I expect the sea will have gone down in a few hours, and then we can have a regular meal; but if you were to light that smelly thing again now it would make me ill. Now, Jack, I will light my pipe and look out again, and you shall come <b>out</b> too for <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> of fresh air. I will hold you tight and see that you don't go over." ...|$|R

60|$|His master was so delighted {{at his new}} {{customer}} that {{he knocked}} Tom down out of hand, and drank more beer that night than he usually did in two, {{in order to be}} sure of getting up in time next morning; for the more a man's head aches when he wakes, the more glad he is to turn <b>out,</b> and have <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> of fresh air. And, when he did get up at four the next morning, he knocked Tom down again, in order to teach him (as young gentlemen used to be taught at public schools) that he must be an extra good boy that day, as they were going to a very great house, and might make a very good thing of it, if they could but give satisfaction.|$|R
60|$|Across {{the vast}} inland expanse, brooded {{over by a}} leaden sky, leaden rain fell, {{dimpling}} like shot the sluggish pools of the flood; a cloudy chaos of fallen trees, drifting barns and outhouses, wagons and agricultural implements moved {{over the surface of}} the waters, or circled slowly around the outskirts of forests that stood ankle deep in ooze and the current, which in serried phalanx they resisted still. As night fell these forms became still more vague and chaotic, and were interspersed with the scattered lanterns and flaming torches of relief-boats, or occasionally the high terraced gleaming windows of the great steamboats, feeling their way along the lost channel. At times the opening of a furnace-door shot broad bars of light across the sluggish stream and into the branches of dripping and drift-encumbered trees; at times the looming smoke-stacks sent <b>out</b> <b>a</b> pent-up <b>breath</b> of sparks that illuminated the inky chaos for a moment, and then fell as black and dripping rain. Or perhaps a hoarse shout from some faintly outlined hulk on either side brought a quick response from the relief-boats, and the detaching of a canoe with a blazing pine-knot in its bow into the outer darkness.|$|R
25|$|Breaths are {{classified}} as spontaneous or mandatory based on both the trigger and cycle events. <b>A</b> spontaneous <b>breath</b> is <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> for which the patient both triggers and cycles the <b>breath.</b> <b>A</b> spontaneous <b>breath</b> may occur during <b>a</b> mandatory <b>breath</b> (e.g. Airway Pressure Release Ventilation). <b>A</b> spontaneous <b>breath</b> may be assisted or unassisted. <b>A</b> mandatory <b>breath</b> is <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> for which the machine triggers and/or cycles the <b>breath.</b> <b>A</b> mandatory <b>breath</b> can occur during <b>a</b> spontaneous <b>breath</b> (e.g., High Frequency Jet Ventilation). <b>A</b> mandatory <b>breath</b> is, by definition, assisted.|$|R
60|$|The clock {{upon his}} study table {{pointed to a}} few minutes short of twelve, when his {{attention}} was called to it by a ringing at the door bell. A man of plain habits, he had sent his servants to bed and must needs go down to open the door. He went down, and there found a man without hat or coat, whose shirt sleeves were rolled up tight to his shoulders. For a moment, he thought {{the man had been}} fighting: the rather, as he was much agitated and <b>out</b> of <b>breath.</b> <b>A</b> second look, however, showed him that the man was particularly clean, and not otherwise discomposed as to his dress than as it answered this description.|$|R
