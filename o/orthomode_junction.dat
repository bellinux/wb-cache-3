40|$|Abstract: An {{analysis}} and design concept for the dual-band <b>orthomode</b> <b>junction</b> is presented. The center-piece {{of the design}} is a waveguide six-port cross junction. Its modal analysis is verified by measure-ments available in the literature. After introducing appropriate symmetry planes for the orthomode junc-tion, a principal design approach is outlined. The entire procedure is demonstrated for a K/Ka-band design example. The final design is compared to results from the commercial software package HFSS and {{is found to be}} in good agreement.

40|$|Abstract — Wideband dual-polarization {{performance}} is desired for low-noise receivers and radiom eters at cent imete r and m illimeter wavelengths. The {{use of a}} waveguide orthomode transducer (OMT) can increase spectral coverage and sensitivity while reducing exit aperture size, optical spill, and instrumental polarization offsets. For these reasons, an <b>orthomode</b> <b>junction</b> is favored over a traditional quasi-op tical wire grid for focal plane imaging arrays from a systems perspective. The fabrication and pe rformance o f wideban d symm etric Bøifot OM T junctions at K-, Ka-, Q-, and W-bands are described. Typical WR 10. 0 units have an insertion loss of 40 dB isolation over a> 75 -to- 110 GHz band. The OMT operates with reduced ohmic losses at cryogenic temperatures...|$|E
40|$|An {{invention}} {{is described}} which provides for receiving a circularly polarized signal from an antenna feed connected to orthogonally spaced antenna elements. It also provides for transmitting a linearly polarized signal {{through the same}} feed without switches, and without suffering a 3 dB polarization mismatch loss, using an arrangement of hybrid junctions. The arrangement is comprised of two dividing hybrid junctions, each connected to a different pair of antenna elements and a summing hybrid junction. In one version, a receiver {{is connected to the}} summing hybrid junction directly. A diplexer is used to connect a transmitter to only one pair of antenna elements. In another version, designated left and right circularly polarized (LCP and RCP) transmitters are connected to the summing hybrid junction by separate diplexers, and separate LCP and RCP sensitive receivers are connected to the diplexers in order to transmit linearly polarized signals using all four antenna elements while receiving circularly polarized signals as before. An <b>orthomode</b> <b>junction</b> and horn antenna may replace the two dividing hybrid junctions and antenna feed...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the design, construction {{and performance of}} a compact orthomode transducer (OMT) for the L-band receiver (1. 3 GHz - 1. 8 GHz) of the Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT). The complete OMT consists of a cylindrical <b>orthomode</b> <b>junction</b> (OMJ), which is presented in this paper, and two identical 180 ° hybrid power combiners in double ridged waveguide, which have been proposed in a previous work. The OMT operates at the cryogenic temperature of 20 K to reduce its thermal noise contribution to {{the noise of the}} receiving chain. Therefore, particular care has been taken {{in the design of the}} OMJ to minimize its dimension and insure a good thermalization. The proposed OMT has been designed and optimized by using CST Microwave studio, and then manufactured, tested at room temperature, and installed on the L-band receiver of SRT. The measured results fully comply with the design specifications. In particular, the isolation between the OMT output ports is more than 40 dB, and the cross polarization is less than - 35 dB for both polarization channels...|$|E
40|$|An {{object is}} to provide for {{receiving}} a circularly polarized signal from an antenna feed (10) connected to orthogonally spaced antenna elements (11, 12, 13, 14) and for transmitting a linearly polarized signal through the same feed without switches, and without suffering a 3 dB polarization mismatch loss, using an arrangement of hybrid junctions. The arrangement is comprised of two dividing hybrid junctions (15, 16), each connected to a different pair of antenna elements and a summing hybrid junction (17). In one embodiment, a receiver (18) {{is connected to the}} summing hybrid junction directly. A diplexer (19 a or 19 b) is used to connect a transmitter (20 a or 20 b) to only one pair of antenna elements. In an alternative embodiment, designated left and right circularly polarized (LCP and RCP) transmitters (21, 22) are connected to the summing hybrid junction by separate diplexers (23, 24), and separate LCP and RCP sensitive receivers (25, 26) are connected to the diplexers in order to transmit linearly polarized signals using all four antenna elements while receiving circularly polarized signals as before.
