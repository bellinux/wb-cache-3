25|$|Movement {{of fluid}} in the semicircular canals signals the brain about the {{direction}} and speed of rotation of the head – for example, whether we are nodding <b>our</b> <b>head</b> up and down or looking from right to left. Each semicircular canal has a bulbed end, or enlarged portion, that contains hair cells. Rotation of the head causes a flow of fluid, which in turn causes displacement of the top portion of the hair cells that are embedded in the jelly-like cupula. Two other organs {{that are part of}} the vestibular system are the utricle and saccule. These are called the otolithic organs and are responsible for detecting linear acceleration, or movement in a straight line. The hair cells of the otolithic organs are blanketed with a jelly-like layer studded with tiny calcium stones called otoconia. When the head is tilted or the body position is changed with respect to gravity, the displacement of the stones causes the hair cells to bend.|$|E

500|$|While light {{comedy and}} satire might have {{established}} Yiddish theater as a commercially successful medium, it was Goldfaden's higher aspirations for it that eventually earned him recognition as [...] "the Yiddish Shakespeare." [...] As a man broadly read in several languages, he was {{acutely aware that}} there was no Eastern European Jewish tradition of dramatic literature – that his audience was used to seeking just [...] "a good glass of Odobeşti and a song." [...] Years later, he would paraphrase the typical Yiddish theatergoer of the time as saying to him: [...] "We don't go to the theater to make <b>our</b> <b>head</b> swim with sad things. We have enough troubles at home... We go to the theater to cheer ourselves up. We pay up a coin and hope to be distracted, we want to laugh from the heart." ...|$|E

2500|$|Beazley, however, quickly made up {{ground on}} Howard as the Coalition's poll numbers sagged, {{particularly}} when Howard broke his previous {{promise not to}} introduce a Goods and Services Tax (GST). Beazley led the ALP contingent at the Constitutional Convention in February 1998 which was called {{to discuss the issue}} of Australia becoming a republic. Beazley advocated [...] "minimalist" [...] change and described transition to a republic as [...] "unfinished business" [...] for Australia. He said that foreigners [...] "find it strange and anachronistic, as many Australians now clearly do, that <b>our</b> <b>Head</b> of State is not an Australian". The ALP proposed appointment of a president by two-thirds majority of parliament. In his opening address, Beazley told the Convention: ...|$|E

2500|$|A central {{argument}} made by Australian {{republicans is}} that, as Australia {{is an independent}} country, it is inappropriate for Australia to share the person of its monarch with the United Kingdom. Republicans argue that the Australian monarch is not Australian and, as such, {{a person who is}} a national of another country cannot adequately represent Australia, either to itself or {{to the rest of the}} world. Former Chief Justice Gerard Brennan stated that [...] "so long as we retain the existing system <b>our</b> <b>head</b> of state is determined for us essentially by the parliament at Westminster". As Australian Republican Movement member Frank Cassidy put it in a speech on the issue: [...] "In short, we want a resident for President." ...|$|E

Prodigy stated that the album would be released during March 2014 and it would now be titled The Infamous Mobb Deep. He later said the whole project would be getting back to their original gritty New York sound. Prodigy explained to XXL; [...] "I would just say, our signature sound is a dark, sinister-type of sound. There's certain things we're going through in our lives right now, and the lyrics are just up to date. Everything that we're saying is going on right now.

2500|$|The Labor for an Australian Republic Group (LFAR) has {{undertaken}} work {{to explore and}} develop further possible models. One such model is the 50/50 model.This model is supported and created by Anthony Cianflone – LFAR Grassroots Member. A new President of Australia would become <b>our</b> <b>Head</b> of State after being elected under a 50-50 model i.e. 50 per cent of the vote would be elected by the Australian people and 50 per cent of the vote would be elected by a joint sitting of the Australian Parliament. The President of Australia would play a similar ceremonial role to our current Governor General. However under the 50-50 model the President {{would be more than}} just a ceremonial figure. The vision is for the Australian President to act as Australia’s ‘Social Conscience and Moral Compass’. The President would have the capacity to influence and campaign on non-partisan issues such as Aboriginal Policy, Veterans’ Affairs, Education, Health, Environment, Human Rights, Multiculturalism, Domestic Violence, Homelessness, Poverty, Disabilities, Youth, Women, Arts, Tourism, Families, Older Australians and Sport. Whilst not having the power to veto bills, prior to providing Presidential ascent, the Constitution could allow for the President to review and seek further clarification, and information on bills from the Parliament based on a ‘Social and Moral Conscience Charter’. The President’s annual ‘State of the Nation’ Address’ to Parliament would provide one of the key formal mechanisms for the President to relay to Parliamentarians the priorities and expectation of Australians in relation to the non-partisan issues, and help improve the quality and consistency of policy reforms, parliamentary debates and community outcomes over the lifetime of different governments.|$|E
