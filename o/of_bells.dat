5|$|Military {{strategy}} and military training {{were treated as}} sciences that could be studied and perfected; soldiers were tested in their skills of using weaponry and in their athletic ability.

40|$|Many Bell {{test results}} violate Bell's {{inequality}}. The premise <b>of</b> <b>Bell's</b> inequality is local determinism. We propose that, it can't be proved that something's mechanism isn't deterministic; if loopholes {{are not the}} reason <b>of</b> violation <b>of</b> <b>Bell's</b> inequality, violation <b>of</b> <b>Bell's</b> inequality illustrates that the mechanism isn't local. We propose a new explanation <b>of</b> <b>Bell</b> test, and the explanation illustrates the locality loophole is not closed by Weihs' experiment. Comment: 14 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

5|$|After {{complaints}} from the dispossessed parishioners of St Faith's, {{the east end}} of the west crypt was allotted to them as their parish church. The congregation were also allowed to keep a detached tower with a peal <b>of</b> <b>bells</b> east of the church which had historically been used to peal the summons to the Cheapside Folkmote. The parish later moved to the Jesus chapel during the reign of Edward VI and was merged with St Augustine Watling Street after the 1666 fire.|$|E
5|$|Bell: Clapper-bells made {{of pottery}} {{have been found}} in several archaeological sites. The {{earliest}} metal bells, with one found in the Taosi site, and four in the Erlitou site, dated to about 2000 BC, may have been derived from the earlier pottery prototype. Early bells not only have an important role in generating metal sound, but arguably played a prominent cultural role. With the emergence of other kinds <b>of</b> <b>bells</b> during the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600– c. 1050 BC), they were relegated to subservient functions; at Shang and Zhou sites, they are also found as part of the horse-and-chariot gear and as collar-bells of dogs.|$|E

5|$|Born in Denver, Colorado, {{and raised}} in Shelburne, New Hampshire, Bevin earned a bachelor's degree at Washington and Lee University in 1989, then served four years of active duty in the U.S. Army, {{attaining}} the rank of captain. He became wealthy in the investment business and moved to Louisville, Kentucky, in 1999. In 2011, he assumed the presidency of Bevin Brothers Manufacturing Company, the last remaining American manufacturer <b>of</b> <b>bells.</b> When Bevin took over, the business, which {{had been in his}} family since its founding in 1832, was struggling and on the verge of closure. Bevin revived the company and restored its profitability.|$|E
5|$|During World War II {{the demand}} for metal for the war effort {{resulted}} in many bells being melted down for scrap. As a result, those that survived are generally regarded as important historic artifacts. More than 70,000 bells (approximately 90 per cent of the bonshō then in existence) were destroyed in this way. However, rapid production <b>of</b> <b>bells</b> during the post-war period meant that by 1995 the number of temple bells in Japan had returned to pre-war levels.|$|E
5|$|The first Castellania {{was built}} in 1572, during the magistracy of Grand Master Jean de la Cassière, and was likely {{designed}} by Girolamo Cassar, similar to other Valletta buildings of the late 16th century. The building had a military appearance, with the corners designed with massive quoins, typical of Cassar. The Castellania made use <b>of</b> <b>bells</b> to attract people and inform about an event, such as a guilty verdict. Similar to other prominent buildings, the Castellania was provided with water within its courtyard by connection to the Wignacourt Aqueduct.|$|E

5|$|After {{learning}} to speak English, the children– Ralph says just the surviving girl– {{explained that they}} came from a land where the sun never shone and the light was like twilight. William says the children called their home St Martin's Land; Ralph adds that everything there was green. According to William, the children were unable to account for their arrival in Woolpit; they had been herding their father's cattle when they heard a loud noise (according to William, the bells of Bury St Edmunds) and suddenly found themselves by the wolf pit where they were found. Ralph says that they had become lost when they followed the cattle into a cave and, after being guided by the sound <b>of</b> <b>bells,</b> eventually emerged into our land.|$|E

After that, a new, metal-plated coffin was made, and as it was lowered into the grave, the funeral servants could not handle its weight and the coffin fell with a loud crash into the grave hole. This account, however, was contested by Georgy Kovalenko, one of the funeral servants—according to him, twenty minutes before the deposition of the coffin he {{was asked by the}} Kremlin custodian Semyon Shornikov to lower the coffin simultaneously with the chime <b>of</b> <b>bells.</b>|$|E

5|$|On February 21, {{exactly a}} week after the {{shooting}} happened, five minutes of silence were observed from 3:06-3:11p.m. CST, accompanied by the tolling <b>of</b> <b>bells</b> throughout the community, at a special ceremony attended by thousands in memory of the victims which was held at the MLK Commons. Moments of silence were also held elsewhere throughout the DeKalb community. There was a special memorial service held in the NIU Convocation Center on February 24, the day before classes resumed, in honor of the victims that initiated a set of activities and services aimed at community recovery. Due to the loss of one week of instructional time {{in the middle of the}} semester, an extra week was added in May.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{technology}} {{began to}} be turned {{to the problem of}} directly chilling rooms and containers, to replace the need to carry ice at all. Pressure began to grow for a replacement for ice bunkers on the trans-Atlantic routes during the 1870s. Tellier produced a chilled storeroom for the steamship Le Frigorifique, using it to ship beef from Argentina to France, while the Glasgow-based firm <b>of</b> <b>Bells</b> helped to sponsor a new, compressed-air chiller for ships using the Gorrie approach, called the Bell-Coleman design. These technologies soon became used on the trade to Australia, New Zealand and Argentina. The same approach {{began to be}} taken in other industries. Carl von Linde found ways of applying mechanical refrigeration to the brewing industry, removing its reliance on natural ice; cold warehouses and meat packers began to rely on chilling plants.|$|E
5|$|The Primera Junta {{was finally}} established. It was {{composed}} by president Cornelio Saavedra, members Manuel Alberti, Miguel de Azcuénaga, Manuel Belgrano, Juan José Castelli, Domingo Matheu and Juan Larrea, and secretaries Juan José Paso and Mariano Moreno. The rules governing it were {{roughly the same}} as those issued the day before, with the additional provisions that the Cabildo would watch over the members of the Junta and that the Junta itself would appoint replacements in case of vacancies. Saavedra spoke to the crowd, and then moved on to the Fort, among salvos of artillery and the ringing <b>of</b> <b>bells.</b> Meanwhile, Cisneros dispatched a post rider to Córdoba, Argentina, to warn Santiago de Liniers about what had happened in Buenos Aires and to request military action against the Junta.|$|E
40|$|The logical {{foundations}} <b>of</b> <b>Bell's</b> inequality are reexamined. We {{argue that}} {{the form of the}} reality condition that underpins Bell's inequality comes from the requirement of solving the quantum measurement problem. Hence any violation <b>of</b> <b>Bell's</b> inequality necessarily implies nonlocality because of the measurement problem. The differences in the implications of deterministic and stochastic formulations <b>of</b> <b>Bell's</b> inequality are highlighted. The reality condition used in Bell's inequality is shown to be a generalisation of Einstein's later form of realism. Comment: 15 page...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a revised}} version {{with respect to}} the one {{submitted}} on Mon, 3 Jul 2000. By mistake an earlier version and not the final one was submitted. We prove that the locality condition is irrelevant to Bell in equality. We check that the real origin <b>of</b> the <b>Bell’s</b> inequality is the assumption of applicability of classical (Kolmogorovian) probability theory to quantum mechanics. We describe the chameleon effect which allows to construct an experiment realizing a local, realistic, classical, deterministic and macroscopic violation <b>of</b> the <b>Bell</b> inequalities.

5|$|The tower has {{numerous}} put-log holes, and {{is supported}} on four massive columns and surmounted by a nineteenth century low octagonal broached short slated recessed slated spire with fish-scale slates and weathercock. There are nineteenth century louvred paired cusped bell-lights and a corbelled embattled parapet. The tower contains a fine peal <b>of</b> <b>bells,</b> with {{the oldest of}} the original set of six being cast in 1749 by Rudhall bell foundry. Two were added in 1886, when the bell chamber was renovated. Two more were added to mark the new millennium in 2000, when some of the others were recast or tuned. The work was completed by Spring 2001. The tower presents one of the more noticeable views in Aberystwyth. It also contains a south side clock dated 1859.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps ten {{per cent}} of the {{population}} lived in one of many burghs that {{had grown up in}} the later Medieval period, mainly in the east and south of the country. A characteristic of Scottish burghs was a long main street of tall buildings, with vennels, wynds and alleys leading off it, many of which survive today. In towns, traditional thatched half-timbered houses were interspersed with the larger stone and slate-roofed town houses of merchants and the urban gentry. Most wooden thatched houses have not survived, but stone houses of the period can be seen in Edinburgh at Lady Stair's House, Acheson House and the six-storey Gladstone's Land, an early example of the tendency to build upward in the increasingly crowded towns, producing horizontally divided tenements. Many burghs acquired tollbooths in this period, which acted as town halls, courts and prisons. They often had peels <b>of</b> <b>bells</b> or clock towers and the aspect of a fortress. The Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh was rebuilt on the orders of Mary Queen of Scots from 1561 and housed the parliament {{until the end of the}} 1630s. Other examples can be seen at Tain, Culross and Stonehaven, often showing influences from the Low Countries in their crow-stepped gables and steeples.|$|E
