5|$|As the Norse era {{drew to a}} {{close the}} Norse-speaking princes were {{gradually}} replaced by Gaelic-speaking clan chiefs including the MacLeods <b>of</b> <b>Lewis</b> and Harris, the MacDonalds of the Uists and MacNeil of Barra.

Nonetheless emigration and military service became the choice of many and the archipelago's populations continued to dwindle throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries.

I proposes two modifications <b>of</b> <b>Lewis’s</b> theory which resolve these difficulties. I conclude by tentatively proposing a third modification <b>of</b> <b>Lewis’s</b> theory, one which explains many of the common features shared by the chance theories of physics. ...|$|R

Stackpole and Warneke delivered their stone reliefs in 1940, and the two panels were mounted on either side of the stage of the building's auditorium.|$|E

50|$|The {{books are}} not {{especially}} concerned with technological speculation, {{and in many}} ways read like fantasy adventures combined with themes of biblical history and classical mythology.

5|$|The siege {{was only}} lifted when MacDonald of Dunivaig agreed with MacLean of Duart to {{surrender}} {{half of his}} lands on Islay.

5|$|Though {{the book}} is on its face an {{adventure}} story, a major theme {{is the need for}} a love of education; through this, Milo applies what he has learned in school, advances in his personal development, and learns to love the life that previously bored him.

5|$|According to Clan MacLeod tradition, Leod {{inherited}} {{some of his}} lands from {{a foster}} father, who was a sheriff of the Hebridean island of Skye; other lands he inherited from his father-in-law, {{who was also a}} lord on Skye. MacLeod tradition also states that Leod was the father of four sons and two daughters. Two of these sons founded the two main branches of MacLeods; branches which exist to this day—Tormod (from whom the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan descend) and Torquil (from whom the MacLeods <b>of</b> <b>Lewis</b> descend). The traditional belief that Torquil was a son has also been challenged; the current understanding is that he was a great-grandson of Leod. In recent years, the DNA evidence of men bearing surnames equating to MacLeod has revealed that a certain proportion share a common ancestor—an ancestor considered to have been the clan's founder.|$|E
