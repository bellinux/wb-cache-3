40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the findings of}} a literature review on older persons globally. In recent years the number of older persons aged 60 years and older is growing worldwide. Declining in birth and mortality rates are said to be the main contributors to this new phenomenon. Life expectancy of general population has also increased, and thus the number of <b>older</b> <b>population</b> in society increased. Although all nations in the world are experiencing the growth of <b>older</b> <b>population,</b> developed countries has a relatively large portion of this population in their population structure. The {{purpose of this article is}} analyzing the process of demographic transistion that produces the growth of older person world wide. In particular, it describes the growth of <b>older</b> <b>population</b> globally with particular emphasis on the proportion of <b>older</b> <b>population</b> over the years, distribution of <b>older</b> <b>population,</b> and rate of growth of this <b>older</b> <b>population.</b> By using a secondary analysis, various sources related to older persons at international level are reviewed. This paper highlights that the proportion of <b>older</b> <b>population</b> has increased, it has distributed unevently, and the growth rate of <b>older</b> <b>population</b> is higher as compared to the growth of the total population globally...|$|R

In this exploratory study, 15 participants were interviewed in person using a series of ten open ended questions. The participants were selected according to the criteria of being an older adult, working with or volunteering for older adults, or having been involved in a project which considered the <b>older</b> <b>population</b> as a subgroup within the total population. The participants were personally invited by the researcher to be interviewed and the interview took approximately 40 minutes. Results indicated that creating the tradition of honoring the <b>older</b> <b>population</b> in American culture would require a change on every individual’s part as well as a social revolution. Findings also indicated that the changes were needed not only on the part of society but also on the part of the <b>older</b> <b>population.</b> As society provides opportunities for the <b>older</b> <b>population</b> to be honored, the <b>older</b> <b>population</b> needs to understand and accept what it means to be honored...|$|R

500|$|Seminal {{though this}} moment was, {{it was just}} a start. As his biographer, WK Hancock, noted: [...] "All the same, [...] knew that nations are not made by {{administrative}} arrangements alone". In The Conditions of Future South African Literature, his next essay of significance, he dealt with the other significant factor in nation-building - the cultural and emotional ties needed to form a united community. Within this essay, not at first sight written on an overtly political topic, Smuts declared that a true South African literature did not and could not exist until a true South African nation had been born. The question then arose - what was hindering this development? Smuts identified the inhibiting factor as the relations between Briton and Boer - particularly the effect of the influx of British emigrants to the gold mines of the Transvaal on the deeply conservative Afrikaner population. The relations between these two groups were fraught; the discover of gold and the rapid industrialisation of the Transvaal had done much to disturb the settled ways of the Boer population. With its vast mineral wealth the Transvaal was rapidly becoming the most significant economic unit of South Africa, but the sudden tide of primarily British immigrants caused a great deal of unrest, with the established population decrying the immorality and degeneracy they perceived in the new mineworkers. These divisions, though strongest in the Transvaal, existed to one degree or another throughout South Africa. Smuts, though sympathising with the concerns of the <b>old</b> <b>population,</b> fearful their established ways and traditions would be swamped in a flood of migration, urged the Afrikaners to embrace the new spirit of dynamism which he saw the new migrants injecting. Likewise he exhorted the new population to integrate with the old, to consolidate the white population both {{for the sake of a}} future South African nation but also to secure their survival in the face of the vastly greater Native population.|$|E

60|$|The Celts, however, did not exterminate {{the whole}} Euskarian people; {{they were too}} few in number and too far {{advanced}} in civilisation for such a course. They knew {{it was better to}} make them slaves than to destroy them: for the Celts had just reached, but had not yet got beyond, the slave-making stage of culture. To this day, people of mixed Euskarian parentage, and marked by the long skull, dark complexion, and black eyes of the Euskarian type, form {{a large proportion of the}} English peasantry; and they are found even in Sussex, which subsequently suffered more than most other parts of Britain from the destructive deluge of Teutonic barbarism in the fifth century. But though the Celts did not exterminate the Euskarians, they completely Celticised them, just as the Teuton is now Teutonising the <b>old</b> <b>population</b> of Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. In South Wales and elsewhere, indeed, the aborigines retained their own language and institutions, as Silures and so forth; but in the conquered districts of southern and eastern Britain they learned the tongue of their masters, and came to be counted as Celtic serfs. Thus, at the time when Britain comes forth into the full historic glare of Roman civilisation, we find the country inhabited by a Celtic aristocracy of Aryan type--round-headed, fair-haired, and blue-eyed; together-with a plebs of Celticised Euskarian or half-caste serfs, retaining, as they still retain, the long skulls and dark complexions of their aboriginal ancestors. This was the ethnical composition of the Sussex population at the date of the first Roman invasions.|$|E
