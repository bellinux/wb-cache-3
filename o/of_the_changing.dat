5|$|Boyd spent 30 months {{writing the}} novel. The journal style, with its gaps, false starts and contradictions, {{reinforces}} the theme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> self in the novel. Many plot points simply fade away. The novel received mixed reviews from critics on publication, but has sold well. A television adaptation {{was made with}} the screenplay written by Boyd, first broadcast in 2010.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> Soviet {{policy towards}} its ethnic territories, a {{decision}} was made to increase the proportion of ethnic Russians in the autonomous oblast. On April10, 1936, the predominantly Russian city of Maykop, as well as Giaginsky District and Khansky Selsoviet of Maykopsky District, became a part of the autonomous oblast (with the selsoviet having been incorporated into Giaginsky District). At the same time, the administrative center of the autonomous oblast was moved from Krasnodar to Maykop. Tuapse, a port on the Black Sea, was considered for the role of the administrative center, but the idea was rejected as it would give the native population access to the sea.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{was not a}} {{religious}} man; he viewed the papacy {{as a means to}} consolidate his family's position. He appointed Alessandro as cardinal against accusations of nepotism, fathered a number of illegitimate children, and spent large sums of church money collecting art and antiquities. Around 1545 Charles took the political and military advantage, weakening Paul's hold on the papacy. Aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> tides of influence, Titian abandoned the commission before completion, and for the next 100 years the painting languished unframed in a Farnese cellar.|$|E

5|$|The first {{infrared}} {{observations were}} published in 1998, in which both near and far infrared spectroscopy data was presented. The collected data showed Sakurai's Object's steep brightening in 1996, followed by {{a sharp decline in}} 1999 as expected. It was later found that the Star's steep decline in light was due to the circumstellar dust located around the star, which was present at a temperature of ~680 K. Further infrared data recorded by the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope was published in 2000, in which findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> absorption lines were discussed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the emperor Hadrian the {{proportion}} of Italians in the legions had fallen to just ten percent and provincial citizens now dominated. This low figure is probably a direct result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> needs of military staffing: a system of fixed border defences (Latin: limes) were established around the Empire's periphery under Hadrian, consolidating Trajan's territorial gains. These called for troops to be stationed permanently in the provinces, a prospect more attractive to locally raised rather than Italian troops. The higher prestige and pay {{to be found in the}} Italian dominated Praetorian Guard must also have played a role. The majority of the troops in the legions at the start of the 3rd centuryAD were from the more Romanised (though non-Italian) provinces, especially Illyria. As the century progressed, more and more barbarians (Latin: barbari) were permitted to settle inside of, and tasked with aiding in the defence of, Rome's borders. As a result, greater numbers of barbarous and semi-barbarous peoples were gradually admitted to the army.|$|E
5|$|Camber Castle {{went through}} several {{changes at the}} start of the 17th century. In 1610, Peter Temple was {{appointed}} as captain of the castle, and between 1610 and 1614 the garrison was reduced to 14 soldiers, including only 4 gunners, either as an effort to reduce costs or as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> types of artillery kept at the castle. The north and south bastions were filled in to form solid gun platforms around approximately 1613 and 1615, and an earth rampart called the Rampire was built up against the south corner of the castle. These solid bastions would have sacrificed living space, less in demand with a smaller garrison, but been much cheaper to maintain. Longbows fell out of use in warfare as archery in England declined, and were replaced by arquebuses and muskets, 46 of which were kept at the castle in 1614.|$|E

5|$|The Sunrise Dance Ceremony is not {{an ancient}} Yavapai ceremony. Apache and Yavapai often intermarried and adopted {{elements}} of each other's cultures; these two tribes reside together on the Camp Verde and Fort McDowell reservations. The Sunrise Dance is a four-day rite-of-transition for young Apache girls, which typically takes place from March through October. The sunrise dance is an ancient practice, unique to the Apache. It {{is related to the}} myth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Changing</b> Woman, a powerful figure in Apache culture who is believed to grant longevity. The power of Changing Woman is transferred to the pubescent girl through songs sung by the Medicine Man. A medicine man is joined by other tribal members in singing a series of songs, up to 32 which are believed to have first been sung by Changing Woman.|$|E
