5|$|Invertebrate predators include crabs, starfish and octopuses. Crabs {{crack the}} shells with their pincers and starfish use their water {{vascular}} system {{to force the}} valves apart and then insert part of their stomach between the valves to digest the bivalve's body. It has been found experimentally that both crabs and starfish preferred molluscs that are attached by byssus threads to ones that are cemented to the substrate. This was probably because they could manipulate the shells and <b>open</b> <b>them</b> more easily when they could tackle them from different angles. Octopuses either pull bivalves apart by force, or they bore a hole into the shell and insert a digestive fluid before sucking out the liquified contents.|$|E
5|$|On 21 May 1887, two new {{buildings}} were completed {{at the hospital}} and the Prince and Princess of Wales came to <b>open</b> <b>them</b> officially. Princess Alexandra wished to meet the Elephant Man, so after a tour of the hospital, the royal party went to his rooms for an introduction. The princess shook Merrick's hand and sat with him, an experience that left him overjoyed. She gave him a signed photograph of herself, which became a prized possession, and she sent him a Christmas card each year.|$|E

5|$|Ship's {{regulations}} {{were designed to}} keep third class passengers confined to their area of the ship. The Titanic was fitted with grilles to prevent the classes from mingling and these gates were normally kept closed, although the stewards could <b>open</b> <b>them</b> {{in the event of}} an emergency. In the rush following the collision, the stewards, occupied with waking up sleeping passengers and leading groups of women and children to the boat deck, did not have time to open all the gates, leaving many of the confused third class passengers stuck below decks.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{provides}} a co-operative mode where two players may play through the game's campaign together via split-screen, system link, or through the Xbox Live online service. In co-operative, the missions are slightly altered to suit both players. For instance, some doors may require two players to <b>open</b> <b>them.</b> Additionally, in certain missions, the second player can occasionally start {{far away from the}} main player and takes over an allied character that was AI-controlled in the single player campaign. The respawn procedure is also altered substantially, as if one player dies, the other has to find and revive the partner's corpse to bring it back to life.|$|E
5|$|The snout {{shape of}} {{crocodilians}} varies between species. Crocodiles may have either broad or slender snouts, while {{alligators and caimans}} have mostly broad ones. Gharials have snouts that are extremely elongated. The muscles that close the jaws are much more massive and powerful than the ones that <b>open</b> <b>them,</b> and a crocodilian's jaws can be held shut by a person fairly easily. Conversely, the jaws are extremely difficult to pry open. The powerful closing muscles attach at the median of portion of the lower jaw and the jaw hinge attaches to the atlanto-occipital joint, allowing the animal to open its mouth fairly wide.|$|E

5|$|In the game's single-player mode, {{the player}} must {{complete}} {{a series of}} levels where different types of AI-controlled enemies will try to hinder the player's progress. The game primarily takes place inside labyrinthine underground facilities, but the player can occasionally travel {{over the surface of}} the planets where the facilities are buried to reach other nearby areas. The underground facilities are composed of a set of tunnels and rooms separated by doors. Most of them can be opened by either firing weapons at them or bumping into them, but others require special actions to be performed first before entry is allowed. For instance, some doors require special keys to <b>open</b> <b>them.</b> To finish a level and proceed to the next one, the player must complete a certain set of objectives, ranging from collecting items to activating switches, defeating enemies, and destroying objects, among others. Some levels also feature optional objectives that are not critical but add to the player's overall completion score.|$|E
5|$|The last {{king of the}} Roman Kingdom, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, {{was overthrown}} in 509 BC {{by a group of}} noblemen led by Lucius Junius Brutus. Tarquin made a number of {{attempts}} to retake the throne, including the Tarquinian conspiracy, the war with Veii and Tarquinii and finally the war between Rome and Clusium, all of which failed to achieve Tarquin's objectives. The most important constitutional change during the transition from kingdom to republic involved a new form of chief magistrate. Before the revolution, a king would be elected by the senators for a life term. Now, two consuls were elected by the citizens for an annual term. Each consul would check his colleague, and their limited term in office would <b>open</b> <b>them</b> up to prosecution if they abused the powers of their office. Consular political powers, when exercised conjointly with a consular colleague, were no {{different from those of the}} old king.|$|E
5|$|The first open {{clash between}} the mutineers and {{officers}} {{came on the}} morning of 3 December, when a small group of sailors gathered on the forecastle and, refusing orders to leave, began to argue with the officers. Captain Eyles asked to know their demands, which were an assurance that Temeraire would not go to the West Indies, but instead would return to England. Eventually Rear Admiral Campbell came down to speak to the men, and having informed them that the officers did not know the destination of the ship, he ordered them to disperse. The men went below decks and the incipient mutiny appeared to have been quashed. The ringleaders, numbering around a dozen, remained determined however, and made discreet inquiries among the rest of the crew. Having eventually determined {{that the majority of the}} crew would, if not actually support a mutiny, at least not oppose it, and that the Temeraires crew would be supported by the ship's marines as well as the crews of some of the other warships in Bantry Bay, they decided to press ahead with their plans. The mutiny began with the crew closing the ship's gunports, effectively barricading themselves below deck. Having done so, they refused orders to <b>open</b> <b>them</b> again, jeered the officers and threatened violence. The crew then came up on deck and once again demanded to know their destination and refused to obey orders to sail for anywhere but England. Having presented their demands they returned below decks and resumed the usual shipboard routine as much as they could.|$|E

25|$|A {{series of}} {{meetings}} was convened with Railway Board authorities in July 2009. It was decided to hire a consultant to sketch a master plan for the project including facilities to be incorporated, timeframe for completion and estimated cost. Global tenders inviting the consultants were issued on 26 September and the authorities would <b>open</b> <b>them</b> on 30 October to select the successful bidder who would be given a time frame of ten months to sketch the master plan, but the date was later extended to 24 December which in turn had an indefinite extension due to non-availability of bidders.|$|E

25|$|As {{there was}} a risk of fire from the leaking fuel, the {{commander}} ordered an emergency evacuation of the aircraft. Although the rear doors opened as intended and the evacuation slides deployed, both forward doors required considerable force to <b>open</b> <b>them</b> before all on board could evacuate the aircraft. No injuries were sustained in the evacuation. The investigation subsequently was able to replicate the difficulty in opening both forward doors on the One-Eleven. It was discovered that inadequate guidance from the manufacturer of the escape slides meant that they were incorrectly stowed. One door had an incorrect part fitted. A warning was issued to all One-Eleven operators and the relevant aviation authorities concerning this issue.|$|E
25|$|Their float was {{stocked with}} biscuits, chocolate, Horlicks tablets, Bovril pemmican, 22 gallons (100 litres) {{of water and}} 2 gallons (9 litres) of massage oil for use against exposure. There was also a sail, which they rigged as a {{makeshift}} shelter. After three days of rough weather the sea calmed and the raft drifted. The men's health deteriorated, but the ration cans had keys to <b>open</b> <b>them,</b> and from one of these White improvised a fishing hook. He untwisted the fibres of a rope and made them into a fishing line. With this they caught about 50 fish, which they ate raw. This gave the survivors both protein and nutritious fish oil, which improved their health and did much to keep them alive.|$|E
25|$|On 23 July 2009, the 17:33 {{service to}} Masterton hit a {{mudslide}} blocking the line {{just north of}} Maoribank tunnel near Maymorn. The locomotive, DCP4818, and the first carriage, SWG3422, derailed. Only minor injuries were reported, but the slip and the derailed rolling stock blocked the line, preventing services operating until Sunday evening. The accident highlighted a flaw {{in the design of}} the pneumatically-operated interior doors in the SW carriages, which stuck in position when the compressed air supply was lost as a result of the locomotive being shut down. Three people were needed to <b>open</b> <b>them</b> by hand, sparking concerns that the carriages could not be evacuated quickly in the event of a fire. The doors were modified so they would open automatically if the compressed air supply is lost.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to fire, two animal agents also assist giant sequoia seed release. The more significant {{of the two}} is a longhorn beetle (Phymatodes nitidus) that lays eggs on the cones, into which the larvae then bore holes. This cuts the vascular water supply to the cone scales, allowing the cones to dry and open for the seeds to fall. Cones damaged by the beetles during the summer will slowly open {{over the next several}} months. Some research indicates many cones, particularly higher in the crowns, may need to be partially dried by beetle damage before fire can fully <b>open</b> <b>them.</b> The other agent is the Douglas squirrel (Tamiasciurus douglasi) that gnaws on the fleshy green scales of younger cones. The squirrels are active year round, and some seeds are dislodged and dropped as the cone is eaten.|$|E
25|$|During the early-1800s, the {{government}} of Upper Canada, a majority of which is now Ontario, appropriated settlers to various lots which had been surveyed along the lake shores of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. The townships established along these fronts contained generally fertile land composed of glacial till and clay-rich loam. As these townships filled up, business opportunities presented themselves for investors to purchase native lands and <b>open</b> <b>them</b> to settlement. The Canada Company was the most successful of these ventures, and attracted settlers to vast areas of land in Western Ontario by building routes such as the Huron Road and the Toronto–Sydenham Road during the 1830s and 1840s. As these areas too filled, {{the government}} came under pressure {{to open up the}} unforgiving terrain of the Canadian Shield to settlement, and sought to establish a network of east–west and north–south roads between the Ottawa Valley and Georgian Bay. This area was known as the Ottawa–Huron Tract.|$|E
25|$|Round 3 – Ptolomaea: {{the third}} region of Cocytus {{is named after}} Ptolemy, who invited his {{father-in-law}} Simon Maccabaeus and his sons to a banquet and then killed them (1 Maccabees 16). Traitors to their Guests lie supine in the ice while their tears freeze in their eye sockets, sealing them with small visors of crystal – even the comfort of weeping is denied them. Dante encounters Fra Alberigo, one of the Jovial Friars and a native of Faenza, who asks Dante to remove the visor of ice from his eyes. In 1285, Alberigo invited his opponents, Manfred (his brother) and Alberghetto (Manfred's son), to a banquet at which his men murdered the dinner guests. He explains that often a living person's soul falls to Ptolomea before he dies ("before dark Atropos has cut their thread"). Then, on earth, a demon inhabits the body until the body's natural death. Fra Alberigo's sin is identical in kind to that of Branca d'Oria, a Genoese Ghibelline who, in 1275, invited his father-in-law, Michel Zanche (seen in the Eighth Circle, Bolgia 5) and had him cut to pieces. Branca (that is, his earthly body) did not die until 1325, but his soul, together with that of his nephew who assisted in his treachery, fell to Ptolomaea before Michel Zanche's soul arrived at the bolgia of the Barrators. Dante leaves without keeping his promise to clear Fra Alberigo's eyes of ice ("And yet I did not <b>open</b> <b>them</b> for him; / and it was courtesy to show him rudeness").|$|E
