40|$|Contagious keratoconjunctivitis is {{a rather}} common disease in Norwegian sheep. Since the {{knowledge}} of its aetiology is limited, {{the present study was}} performed to determine the microorganisms involved. Local veterinarians throughout the country collected conjunctival swabs from both sick (n = 43) and healthy (n = 42) sheep on 15 farms with outbreaks of <b>ovine</b> <b>keratoconjunctivitis,</b> and further from healthy sheep (n = 50) on 17 farms not showing any signs of conjunctival disease. All samples were cultivated for bacteria and mycoplasma. Listeria monocytogenes was isolated from 3 cases (1 %) in one single herd. Staphylococcus aureus (5 %), Corynebacterium spp. (2 %) and Escherichia coli (4 %) were isolated only in herds with keratoconjunctivitis, but from both sick and healthy animals. Moraxella (Branhamella) ovis was isolated from 28 % of sampled animals in affected herds and from 10 % of sampled animals in healthy herds. The corresponding numbers for Moraxella spp. were 9 %/ 12 %, for Pseudomonas spp. 7 %/ 8 %, for Staphylococcus spp. 22 %/ 22 %, for Bacillus spp. 12 %/ 14 %, for Micrococcus spp. 6 %/ 2 % and for Streptococcus/Enterococcus spp. 2 %/ 2 %. Mycoplasma conjunctivae was isolated from 16 animals with keratoconjunctivitis (37 %) and from 3 animals without clinical signs (7 %) in farms with keratoconjunctivitis. In farms without clinical signs of keratoconjunctivitis, M. conjunctivae was isolated in 4 animals (8 %). To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} M. conjunctivae has been isolated in Norway. Other predisposing agents found were Moraxella (Branhamella) ovis and Listeria monocytogenes. The etiological importance of different microorganisms in <b>ovine</b> <b>keratoconjunctivitis</b> seems to vary; some are probably only present as secondary invaders. Other possible causes of <b>ovine</b> <b>keratoconjunctivitis</b> in Norway, such as Chlamydia psittaci, remain to be investigated. </p...|$|E

40|$|Chlamydia pecorum is {{globally}} {{associated with}} several <b>ovine</b> diseases including <b>keratoconjunctivitis</b> and polyarthritis. The exact {{relationship between the}} variety of C. pecorum strains reported and the diseases described in sheep remains unclear, challenging efforts to accurately diagnose and manage infected flocks. In the present study, we applied C. pecorum Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) to C. pecorum positive samples collected from sympatric flocks of Australian sheep presenting with conjunctivitis, conjunctivitis with polyarthritis, or polyarthritis only and with no clinical disease (NCD) in order to elucidate the exact relationships between the infecting strains {{and the range of}} diseases. Using Bayesian phylogenetic and cluster analyses on 62 C. pecorum positive ocular, vaginal and rectal swab samples from sheep presenting with a range of diseases and in a comparison to C. pecorum sequence types (STs) from other hosts, one ST (ST 23) was recognised as a globally distributed strain associated with ovine and bovine diseases such as polyarthritis and encephalomyelitis. A second ST (ST 69) presently only described in Australian animals, was detected in association with ovine as well as koala chlamydial infections. The majority of vaginal and rectal C. pecorum STs from animals with NCD and/or anatomical sites with no clinical signs of disease in diseased animals, clustered together in a separate group, by both analyses. Furthermore, eight/ 13 detected STs were novel. This study provides a platform for strain selection for further research into the pathogenic potential of C. pecorum in animals and highlights targets for potential strain-specific diagnostic test development...|$|R

Mycoplasma isolates used in one of these trials, were identified as M. conjunctivae by means of immunofluorescence. Mycoplasma was isolated from approximately 87 % of field cases examined. Branhamella ovis was isolated from 22 % of field cases examined. No Chlamydia sp. or viruses were isolated from any of the outbreaks.

40|$|Infectious <b>Ovine</b> <b>Keratoconjunctivitis</b> (IOK), Pink Eye, has a {{significant}} impact on rejection rates of sheep for live export and thus the feedlot and live export industries in Western Australia. The study aimed to determine the flora and sensitivity to antibiotics of eyes from sheep showing clinical signs of IOK. A diverse range of flora was isolated from eyes of sheep. Of the 352 eyes sampled, up to 37 bacterial species were detected, with the highest number of 28 found in affected eyes (those showing clinical signs of IOK), compared to 23 in unaffected eyes (those showing no clinical signs when the contra-lateral eye was affected), 11 in apparently healthy eyes (rejected sheep showing no signs of IOK in either eye but having mixed with IOK sheep) and 19 species in control sheep eyes (non reject healthy sheep showing no clinical signs of IOK in either eye). In sheep in a pre-export feedlot, the most commonly isolated organism in affected, unaffected and apparently healthy eyes was Moraxella ovis. Mycoplasma species was the second most commonly isolated organism from affected eyes and apparently healthy eyes, and this species was isolated less frequently in unaffected eyes. Mycoplasma spp were isolated at rates of less than 5...|$|E
40|$|Approximately {{two million}} sheep are {{exported}} from Australia annually, worth {{in excess of}} 170 million to the Australian economy. With the live export industry facing increasing scrutiny {{it is essential that}} the industry take steps to optimise the welfare of those animals involved. Infectious <b>ovine</b> <b>keratoconjunctivitis</b> (IOK) is a significant, infectious eye disease of sheep and is the reason for the rejection of many sheep from the live export chain. Establishing a practical and effective treatment protocol has the potential to reduce economic losses associated with rejected stock and to improve the welfare of those animals presenting with clinical disease. Injectable oxytetracycline (OTC) {{has been used as a}} treatment worldwide and has been shown to be effective. However, in pre-embarkation feedlots the number of animals is so large that such individual treatment is not feasible. This research investigated the clinical efficacy and impact on animal health of OTC given in-feed or in-water. Oxytetracycline is absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract following oral administration in feed or water. This research showed that oral administration of OTC results in changes to the rumen microflora population. Although the change in rumen microflora corresponded with reduced feed intakes, feed intakes returned to normal following cessation of treatment, indicating that any changes to the ruminal microbiome are transient. Oxytetracycline given in-feed for five days results in a significant clinical improvement in IOK. In-water OTC caused a persistent decrease in feed and water intake rendering it an unsuitable treatment. Mild cases of IOK can be successfully treated with in-feed OTC for a five-day period at a dose of 20 mg/kg bodyweight. Sheep with more severe IOK can be successfully treated with two intramuscular injections of OTC at 20 mg/kg bodyweight four days apart...|$|E
