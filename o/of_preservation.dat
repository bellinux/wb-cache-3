5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy <b>of</b> <b>preservation.</b> While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. If the federal government is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy <b>of</b> <b>preservation.</b>|$|E

Frozen fish products include breaded or battered fillets, fish fingers and fishcakes. Fish meal {{is used as a}} food supplement for farmed fish and for livestock. Fish oils are made either from fish liver, especially rich in vitamins A and D, or from the bodies of oily fish such as sardine and herring, and used as food supplements and to treat vitamin deficiencies.|$|E

Some of the finest Baroque villas and palazzi, including the Palermo palace of the Prince of Lampedusa, are still in ruins following the United States bombing raids of 1943. In many cases, no attempt has been made to restore or even secure them. Those that survived the raids in good repair are often sub-divided into offices or apartments, their Baroque interiors dismantled, divided, and sold.|$|E

5|$|The near-absence of {{herbivore}} {{remains and}} the similar state <b>of</b> <b>preservation</b> {{common to the}} many individuals at the Albertosaurus bonebed quarry led Currie {{to conclude that the}} locality was not a predator trap like the La Brea Tar Pits in California, and that all of the preserved animals died at the same time. Currie claims this as evidence of pack behaviour. Other scientists are skeptical, observing that the animals may have been driven together by drought, flood or for other reasons.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 5,000 {{buildings were}} damaged beyond repair. In the Qazvin province, 120 buildings were demolished and 50 villages suffered massive damage. In the neighboring Hamadan province, 45 villages were destroyed. A {{large majority of}} houses in the region were single-story masonry buildings, and virtually all of these collapsed. As non-engineered structures, these could not withstand seismic forces, with structural failure and collapse resulting from wall-to-wall separation {{and the lack of}} structural integrity and of a proper lateral system of resisting. Newer structures built in accordance with the Iranian code of practice for seismic-resistant design fared much better. Damage to the historic Kharaqan tomb towers, which were in a good state <b>of</b> <b>preservation</b> before the event, suggests that the earthquake was possibly {{one of the most powerful}} in the region for approximately 900 years.|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} this work are the {{international}} experiences of implementation <b>of</b> digital <b>preservation</b> practices in repositories. It based on bibliographical survey about the beginning <b>of</b> digital <b>preservation</b> practices in digital repositories, identifying important aspects of how to manage the practices <b>of</b> digital <b>preservation</b> on repositories. Most repositories analyzed showed a double function <b>of</b> access and <b>preservation,</b> but few could {{be considered to be}} "dark archives" used only for preservation matters. The application <b>of</b> digital <b>preservation</b> standards showed that large institutions possessed detailed definitions of what stored materials could be filed and used. Repositories managers had some kind of operating budget to carry on preservation activities. Most repositories cited in the bibliography used a combination of commercial tools and free software. As a conclusion, the records analyzed reinforce the need today of the application <b>of</b> digital <b>preservation</b> strategies using the OAIS Reference Model and official audit certification actions  on the design <b>of</b> digital <b>preservation</b> repositories, to keep the integration flexibility of  functions and services that go beyond the repository...|$|R

5|$|Excavators {{found the}} body of the Haraldskær Woman in a supine {{position}} in an excellent state <b>of</b> <b>preservation.</b> She was naked and her clothes, consisting of a leather cape and three woolen garments, had been placed on top of her. Hurdles of branches and wooden poles pinned the body down. The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the knee joint area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her skin was deeply bronzed with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state as if she had died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old when she died and in good health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.|$|E
5|$|High {{levels of}} both {{sugar and salt}} can {{preserve}} food by preventing micro-organisms from growing. Green beans can be salted by layering the pods with salt, but this method <b>of</b> <b>preservation</b> is unsuited to most vegetables. Marrows, beetroot, carrot, and some other vegetables can be boiled with sugar to create jams. Vinegar is widely used in food preservation; a sufficient concentration of acetic acid prevents the development of destructive micro-organisms, a fact made use of {{in the preparation of}} pickles, chutneys and relishes. Fermentation is another method of preserving vegetables for later use. Sauerkraut is made from chopped cabbage and relies on lactic acid bacteria which produce compounds that are inhibitory to the growth of other micro-organisms.|$|E
