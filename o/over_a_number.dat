In 687–688, the final Heraclian emperor, Justinian II, led an expedition against the Slavs and Bulgarians, and made significant gains, although {{the fact that he}} had to fight his way from Thrace to Macedonia demonstrates the degree to which Byzantine power in the north Balkans had declined.|$|E

5|$|The {{declaration}} {{had many}} long-lasting consequences. It greatly increased {{popular support for}} Zionism, {{and led to the}} creation of Mandatory Palestine, which later became Israel and the Palestinian territories. As a result it is considered to have caused the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict, often described as the world's most intractable conflict. Controversy remains <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of areas, such as whether the declaration contradicted earlier promises the British made to the Sharif of Mecca in the McMahon–Hussein correspondence.|$|E
5|$|The raiding {{forces were}} mostly {{provided}} by the British Commandos, but the two largest raids, Operation Gauntlet and Operation Jubilee, drew heavily on Canadian troops. The size of the raiding force depended on the objective. The smallest raid was two men from No. 6 Commando in Operation J V. The largest raid involved over 10,500 men in Operation Jubilee. Most of the raids were scheduled to only last overnight, but some, like Operation Gauntlet, were conducted <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of days.|$|E

5|$|Alarmed by this Spartan naval resurgence, the Athenians {{sent out}} a fleet of 40 triremes under Thrasybulus. He, judging that he could {{accomplish}} more by campaigning where the Spartan fleet was not than by challenging it directly, sailed to the Hellespont. Once there, he won over several major states to the Athenian side and placed a duty on ships sailing past Byzantium, restoring a source of revenue that the Athenians had relied on in the late Peloponnesian War. He then sailed to Lesbos, where, {{with the support of}} the Mytileneans, he defeated the Spartan forces on the island and won <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of cities. While still on Lesbos, however, Thrasybulus was killed by raiders from the city of Aspendus.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, {{as in the case}} of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, {{as in the case of}} games, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with stage magic. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of consecutive days.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a meeting}} with {{attorneys}} on May 10, 1961 intended to resolve the dispute, Dave Guard resigned from the Kingston Trio, though pledging to fulfill group commitments through November of that year. Shane, Reynolds, and Werber bought out Guard's interest in the partnership for $300,000 to be paid <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of years and moved to replace him immediately. The remaining Trio partners settled quickly on John Stewart, a 21-year-old member of the Cumberland Three, one of the myriad of groups that sprang up hoping to imitate the Kingston Trio's success. Stewart was already well-acquainted with Reynolds and Shane, having sold two of his early songwriting efforts to the Trio, {{and he was a}} proficient guitarist, banjoist, and singer who seemed to the partners to be perfectly positioned to replace Guard. Stewart began rehearsing and recording with the group nearly immediately, commencing public appearances with the Trio in September 1961.|$|E

5|$|Henry and Becket quickly {{disagreed}} <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of issues, including Becket's {{attempts to}} regain control of lands belonging to the archbishopric and his views on Henry's taxation policies. The main source of conflict, however, concerned the treatment of clergy who committed secular crimes: Henry argued that the legal custom in England allowed the king to enforce justice over these clerics, while Becket maintained that only church courts could try the cases. The matter came to a head in January 1164, when Henry forced through agreement to the Constitutions of Clarendon; under tremendous pressure, Becket temporarily agreed but changed his position shortly afterwards. The legal argument was complex at the time and remains contentious.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, the MCA {{assessed}} the NEP {{and other government}} policies from a Chinese point of view. Its findings expressed concern <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of problems, including alleged disrespect of the citizenship of the Malaysian Chinese and the Malay-dominated civil service, claiming the NEP's goal of eradicating identification of race with economic function had been abrogated. In addition, it was argued that non-Malays were under-represented in Parliament and the Cabinet because of gerrymandering; mostly Malay rural Parliamentary constituencies outnumbered heterogeneous urban constituencies, despite {{the total population of}} urban constituencies exceeding that of rural ones. However, UMNO avoided directly confronting the MCA over the issue.|$|E
5|$|Judge Green presided <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of notable cases {{during his}} 35-year tenure on the Eastern District. In Bolden v. Pennsylvania State Police Judge Green ordered the Pennsylvania State Police to {{reinstate}} William Bolden, a minority trooper {{who had been}} dismissed. The case, which began in 1973, resulted in a consent decree that required the State Police to hire one minority for every non-minority hired, and set additional goals for promotion and retention of minority troopers. Judge Green presided over the consent decree for 25 years, dissolving it in 1999. The case was credited with helping to abolish racism in the hiring of troopers, and integrate the State Police.|$|E
