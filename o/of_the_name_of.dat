5|$|In 1346, William Douglas (c. 1327–1384), {{nephew of}} Robert the Bruce's {{companion}} Sir James Douglas, {{had returned to}} Scotland, from France, to claim his inheritance as chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Douglas. By murdering his godfather, Sir William Douglas of Liddesdale, William became the undisputed head of the House of Douglas. He was created Earl of Douglas in 1358.|$|E

5|$|The {{definite}} Albanian form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> city is Gjirokastra, {{while in}} the Gheg Albanian dialect it is known as Gjinokastër, both of which derive from the Greek name. Alternative spellings found in Western sources are Girokaster and Girokastra. In Aromanian the city is known as Ljurocastru, while in modern Greek it is known Αργυρόκαστρο (Argyrokastro). During the Ottoman era the town was known in Turkish as Ergiri.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} MacPaint {{was developed}} by Bill Atkinson, a member of Apple's original Macintosh development team. Early development versions of MacPaint were called MacSketch, still retaining part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> its roots, LisaSketch. It was later developed by Claris, the software subsidiary of Apple which was formed in 1987. The last version of MacPaint was version 2.0, released in 1988. It was discontinued by Claris in 1998 because of diminishing sales.|$|E
5|$|Winnipeg the Bear, {{which would}} later become the {{inspiration}} for part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Winnie-the-Pooh, was purchased in Ontario by Lieutenant Harry Colebourn of the Fort Garry Horse.

Shepard, created the only known oil painting of Winnipeg's adopted fictional bear, displayed in Assiniboine Park.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Ramcharitmanas, there is a section devoted to the veneration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Rama. As per Tulsidas, repeating the name of Rama is the only means to attain God in the Kali age where the means suited for other ages like meditation, Karma, and Puja are ineffective. He says in Kavitavali that his own redemption is because of the power, glory and majesty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Rama. In a couplet in the Gitavali, Tulsidas says that wishing for liberation without refuge in the name of Rama is like wishing to climb to the sky by holding on to the falling rain. In his view, the name of Rama is greater than both Nirguna and Saguna aspects of God – it controls both of them and is illuminates both like a bilingual interpreter. In a verse in the Dohavali, Tulsidas says that the Nirguna Brahman resides in his heart, the Saguna Brahman resides in his eyes and the name of Rama resides on his tongue, as if a radiant gemstone is kept between the lower and upper halves of a golden casket. He holds that Rama is superior to all other names of God, and argues that ra and ma being are the only two consonants that are written above all other consonants in the conjunct form in Sanskrit because they are the two sounds in the word Rama.|$|E
5|$|Besides the Slavs, the {{presence}} of a German-speaking population can be demonstrated based on toponyms. For instance, the Hungarians adopted the Germanized form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the river Vulka (whose name is of Slavic origin) and the document known as the Conversion of the Bavarians and the Carantanians from around 870 lists Germanic place names in Pannonia, including Salapiugin ("bend of the Zala") and Mosaburc ("fortress in the marshes"). Finally, the name of the Barca, Barót and other rivers could be either Turkic or Slavic.|$|E
5|$|Country Bill's Restaurant was a family-owned American-style steakhouse {{and seafood}} {{restaurant}} in the Woodstock neighborhood of southeast Portland, Oregon, in the United States. Adjacent to the restaurant was a bar called CB's Lounge. The restaurant opened in 1964 when ownership transferred from Bill Blake to Ron Thomas' family. Though Thomas was not particularly fond <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the business Blake had established in 1960, {{he was unable to}} afford new signage and kept the lounge's title. Over time the restaurant grew from a hamburger stand into a family dining restaurant, expanding from one space to four. In 1978, the family purchased the building and property following the landlord's death.|$|E

5|$|For {{at least}} 10,000years, {{a variety of}} {{indigenous}} peoples populated the Willamette Valley. These included the Kalapuya, the Chinook, and the Clackamas. The territory of the Clackamas encompassed the northeastern portion of the basin, including the Clackamas River (with which their name is shared). Although it is unclear exactly when, {{the territory of the}} Chinook once extended across {{the northern part of the}} watershed, through the Columbia River valley. Indigenous peoples of the Willamette Valley were further divided into groups including the Kalapuyan-speaking Yamhill and Atfalati (Tualatin) (both Northern Kalapuya), Central Kalapuya like the Santiam, Muddy Creek (Chemapho), Long Tom (Chelamela), Calapooia (Tsankupi), Marys River (Chepenafa) and Luckiamute, and the Yoncalla or Southern Kalapuya, as well other tribes such as the Chuchsney-Tufti, Siuslaw and Molala. The name Willamette is of indigenous origin, deriving from the French pronunciation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> a Clackamas Native American village. However, Native American languages in Oregon were very similar, so the name may also be derived from Kalapuya dialects.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, St Thomas's Hospital Medical School {{was granted}} its own {{coat of arms}}. However, the St Thomas' Hospital coat of arms has still been used. Guy’s Medical School {{proposed}} to apply for its own coat of arms after separating from Guy’s Hospital, yet the school decided to continue to use Guy's Hospital’s arms in 1954. The two medical schools merged in 1982 and became the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals (UMDS). Simon Argles, secretary of UMDS, said that because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the medical school it was more appropriate to use the hospital's coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman era, copper was principally mined on Cyprus, {{the origin}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the metal, from aes сyprium (metal of Cyprus), later {{corrupted}} to сuprum, {{from which the}} words copper (English), cuivre (French), Koper (Dutch) and Kupfer (German) are all derived. The commonly encountered compounds are copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite, malachite, and turquoise, and have been used widely and historically as pigments. Copper used in buildings, usually for roofing, oxidizes to form a green verdigris (or patina). Copper is sometimes used in decorative art, both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments. Copper compounds are used as bacteriostatic agents, fungicides, and wood preservatives.|$|E

5|$|Matheson {{proposed}} that when Camden published his Britannia which included {{an account of}} the kings of Mann, genealogists saw the Latin Olavus (a Latin form of the Old Norse Óláfr) and concluded that it represented the Gaelic name Olbhar, Olghair. However, the Scottish Gaelic form of Olaf, Olavus, Olaus, Óláfr, is in fact Amhlaoibh, and the more modern Amhlaidh. Matheson further {{proposed that}} Leod's father's name also equates to Ölvir. So in Matheson's opinion, genealogists mistakenly attached Leod's father and great-grandfather to the Manx king Olaf the Black and his own grandfather, Olaf the Red. While Matheson's identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Leod's grandfather is now accepted, Sellar later disagreed with him on the name of Leod's father; proposing instead that it was more likely the Gaelic name Gillemuire—a name which appears on one of the four Gaelic-language genealogies.|$|E

Muskrat Lake is home to another paranormal phenomenon: local legends state that an Atomic Energy of Canada bus driver saw an extraterrestrial spacecraft landing on a spot atop a hill and leaving. There is indeed a dark-colored, circular outline on this hill where grass does not grow, with no widely accepted cause.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the words}} {{exchanged}} by {{the bride and}} groom (including the speaking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Eru Ilúvatar) and the consummation are required for marriage.

The bride’s mother gives the groom a jewel to wear (Galadriel's gift of the Elfstone to Aragorn reflects this tradition; she is grandmother to his betrothed, Arwen, Arwen's mother Celebrían having left Middle-earth for Valinor after grievous psychological injury after her capture by Orcs and liberation by her sons).|$|E

5|$|The lion is {{probably}} represented more frequently and diversely {{than any other}} animal. In most forms, the lion has no apotropaic meaning and was merely decorative. However, it sometimes has an astrological or symbolic meaning.

5|$|The origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the pub is unclear, but one {{reported}} {{theory is}} that it was named after the 17th-century warship HMS Royal Oak, which was sunk at the nearby Raid on the Medway in 1664.

Another {{theory is that}} it was named after the Royal Oak that Charles II of England hid in following the Battle of Worcester.|$|E
5|$|A careful {{examination}} of Facsimile No. 2 {{shows that there}} is a difference between most of the hieroglyphic signs and the signs on the right third of the figure on the outer edge as well as the outer portions of the sections numbered 12–15. These signs are hieratic, not hieroglyphic, and are inverted, or upside down, to the rest of the text. In fact, they are a fairly accurate copy of lines 2, 3, and 4 of the Joseph Smith Papyrus XI, which contains a portion of the Book of Breathings. Especially clear is the word snsn, in section 14, and part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the mother of the owner of the papyrus, (tay-)uby.t, repeated twice on the outer edge. An ink drawing of the hypocephalus in the Church Historian's office shows these same areas as being blank. It is likely that these portions were destroyed on the original hypocephalus and someone (the engraver, one of Joseph Smith's associates, or Joseph himself) copied the lines from the Book of Breathings papyrus for aesthetic purposes.|$|E
