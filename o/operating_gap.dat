40|$|AbstractA {{prototype}} of a rotational machine with two HTS bearings supporting a rotor without a mechanical contact has been designed, manufactured and tested. An arrangement of HTS elements with 180 -g total mass provide stable suspension of a 3. 6 -kg rotor with 1. 0 -mm <b>operating</b> <b>gap.</b> The maximal load {{capability of the}} bearing {{was measured to be}} 220 N in the radial direction and 150 N in the axial. The ratio of the radial load capability to the mass of superconductors exceeded 120. The maximum rotation frequency was 14500 rpm...|$|E
40|$|The 500 mA {{beam current}} upgrade project at Taiwan Light Source (TLS) is {{expected}} to reach the following basic goals: 1) reducing the longitudinal coupled bunch instability by using a single cavity, 2) being damped Higher-Order-Mode (HOM) in cavity to provide very stable photon beam, 3) increasing the stored beam current up to 500 mA, 4) maintaining the beam lifetime by increasing the <b>operating</b> <b>gap</b> voltage from 0. 8 MV to 1. 6 MV. The Superconducting RF cavity designed by Cornell University and tested at Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) will be installed at TLS. The basic layout of the construction plan will be presented. The beam parameters calculation will be discussed. ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Gap</b> <b>operates</b> company-owned {{stores in}} the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Indonesia, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico as of May 2016; it also has {{franchise}} agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to <b>operate</b> <b>Gap,</b> Banana Republic, or Old Navy stores in 43 countries. As of May 2016, <b>Gap</b> Inc. <b>operates</b> 3,727 company-owned and franchise locations. In January 2008, Gap signed a deal with Marinopoulos Group to open Gap and Banana Republic stores in Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Croatia. In February 2009, Elbit Imaging, Ltd. secured a franchise to open and <b>operate</b> <b>Gap</b> and Banana Republic stores in Israel. In August 2010, the company opened its first store in Melbourne, Australia at Chadstone Shopping Centre. In September 2011, Komax opened the first Gap store in Chile, due to a franchise. In October 2011, the first GAP store opened in Warsaw, Poland, but shut it down and two other locations in Wroc≈Çaw and Katowice in 2015. Gap now has a store in New Delhi, India which opened in May 2015. On 20 February 2016, Gap launched stores in Mumbai at Oberoi Mall and Infinity-2.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of tip gap on {{gas generator turbine}} efficiency is so significant that designers have {{a strong desire to}} improve the efficiency by decreasing the tip to shroud <b>operating</b> <b>gaps</b> (but there are impassable mechanical limits), or by implementing more effective tip clearance controls.

40|$|An {{optimized}} end pole {{compensation scheme}} for the 1. 8 Tesla, 25 -pole wiggler W 20 /SRRC was studied by using 2 D magnetostatic code OPERA- 2 d. The maximum deviation of the dipole steering for this wiggler can be minimized either by optimizing {{the sizes of}} the bias magnets or by optimizing the easy-axis rotating angles of the permanent rotators. After optimization, the dipole steering is within 100 Gauss-cm in the <b>operating</b> <b>gap</b> range so that a passive compensation scheme is possible even for an insertion device configured with very strong on-axis magnetic field strength. I. INTRODUCTION There are usually end correctors located {{at both ends of}} the insertion device to compensate the residual dipole steering due to the fringe magnetic field contributions as well as the magnetic field errors, which can be characterized by the first integral of the magnetic field (I 1) through the entire magnetic structure. Basically, the design goal of the end correction scheme could be guided in two directi [...] ...|$|E
