It belongs to a special category of benedictions such as Manifest Destiny <b>or</b> <b>Chosen</b> <b>People</b> that imply national, racial, or ethnic self-conceit." [...] The nationalist and racist connotations of Japanese Yamato-damashii are comparable with German Herrenvolk ("Master race").|$|E
5000|$|M.I.O.A.K. (Mystic Insignia Of A Klansman) is a red, round patch worn {{over the}} left breast of a Klansmans robe.

The {{symbolism}} behind the insignia, according to various KKK groups, is that the blood drop {{in the center of}} the cross represents the blood shed by Jesus Christ at the Crucifixion, for the white Aryan race, whom they see as God's master race <b>or</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In Mormonism, all Latter Day Saints {{are viewed}} as covenant, <b>or</b> <b>chosen,</b> <b>people</b> because they have {{accepted}} the name of Jesus Christ through the ordinance of baptism.

This lineage may be blood related or through [...] "adoption;" [...] therefore, a child may not necessarily share the lineage of her parents (but will still {{be a member of}} the tribes of Israel). It is a widely held belief that most members of the faith are in the tribe of Ephraim or the tribe of Manasseh.|$|E

25|$|A {{noticeable}} {{feature is}} the missing main altar, which is known only from a description found in the inventory from 1766. It was carved from dark wood, gilded, and served as the focal center of the otherwise white interior. The altar had two levels. The upper level had a miraculous painting of Saint Peter that was most likely brought from the previous church. It was surrounded by sculptures of the twelve apostles representing the twelve tribes of Israel <b>or</b> the <b>chosen</b> <b>people.</b> The lower lever had a painting of Saint Paul surrounded by sculptures depicting twelve pagan nations representing the world or the converted people. This altar {{was moved to the}} Catholic church in Daugai in 1766 and only fragments survive to the present day. With the loss of the altar, imagery of Saint Paul diminished significantly within the church. The altar as such was not replaced. Instead, Kazimierz Jelski sculpted four prophets (Daniel, Jeremiah, Isaiah and Elijah) while Franciszek Smuglewicz painted the large central painting depicting the emotional final parting of Saint Peter and Paul.|$|R
50|$|In {{an attempt}} to compare the {{self-evaluation}} motives (excluding self-improvement) a self-reflection task was employed.

On the whole, people self-enhanced more than they self-assessed <b>or</b> self-verified. <b>People</b> <b>chose</b> higher diagnosticity questions concerning central, positive traits than central, negative ones, and answered yes more often to central, positive than negative questions. Also, people self-verified more than the self-assessed, and chose more questions overall concerning relatively certain central traits than relatively uncertain peripheral traits.|$|R

50|$|Once the Jews {{arrived in}} the Ghetto in 1571, the Medici {{provided}} them with {{a reasonable amount of}} freedom to manage their own political affairs. There were two magistrates that were in charge of overseeing all of these affairs inside the Ghetto: The Nine Preservers of the Florentine Dominion and Jurisdiction and The Eight Magistrates for the Protection and Supervision of the City of Florence. Within the Ghetto, only a limited amount of men were given the freedom to represent themselves in the political sphere, by attending meetings, being allowed to vote, and being given the ability to hold positions in office. However, for the majority of men and women were not given these types of political representation in the Ghetto <b>or</b> beyond. The <b>chosen</b> <b>people</b> that were given the right to political representation within the Florentine Ghetto had the job of acting as spokesmen {{for the rest of the}} Ghetto community that had no voice.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} process of {{identity}} formation as related to adolescents level of moral development, race, sex, and family configuration. Ego identity was operationalized into four identity statuses based on an adolescent's reported degree of exploration and goal commitment {{in the areas of}} occupation, religion, politics, and philosophy (ideological identity) and in the areas of friendship, dating, sex roles, and recreation (interpersonal identity). People with the status of "identity achievement " have experienced a crisis, resolved it successfully, and are pursuing self-chosen goals. Individuals of "foreclosure " status also have anidentity, but it is parentally <b>or</b> societally <b>chosen.</b> <b>People</b> classified as "identity diffused " {{may or may not have}} experienced a crisis, and are not pursuing any goals. The fourth status, "moratorium, " includes those individuals who are actually in crisis and have goals that are present but vague. Subjects were 288 ninth grade students (the entire class) from a small southeastern town, who completed the Extended Objective Measure of Ego Identity Status Final Revision and the Sociomoral Reflection Objective Measure. School records provided demographic data, and a student checklist indicated family configuration. Ideological identity was related to sex, race, and family configuration, but not to level of moral reasoning. No significant associations were found for interpersonalidentity.

60|$|Besides, it {{is a most}} {{important}} social act; nay, at bottom, the one important social act. Given the men a <b>People</b> <b>choose,</b> the <b>People</b> itself, in its exact worth and worthlessness, is given. A heroic <b>people</b> <b>chooses</b> heroes, and is happy; a valet <b>or</b> flunky <b>people</b> <b>chooses</b> sham-heroes, what are called quacks, thinking them heroes, and is not happy. The grand summary of a man's spiritual condition, what brings out all his herohood and insight, or all his flunkyhood and horn-eyed dimness, is this question put to him, What man dost thou honour? Which is thy ideal of a man; or nearest that? So too of a People: for a People too, every People, speaks its choice,--were it only by silently obeying, and not revolting,--in {{the course of a}} century or so. Nor are electoral methods, Reform Bills and suchlike, unimportant. A People's electoral methods are, in the long-run, the express image of its electoral talent; tending and gravitating perpetually, irresistibly, to a conformity with that: and are, at all stages, very significant of the People. Judicious readers, of these times, are not disinclined to see how Monks elect their Abbot in the Twelfth Century: how the St. Edmundsbury mountain manages its midwifery; and what mouse or man the outcome is.|$|R

40|$|The Bible {{proved a}} {{significant}} resource for European imperialism both in aiding colonisers {{to impose their}} own culture on those they conquered and in justifying their annexation and administration of other peoples 2 ̆ 7 territory. Metaphors drawn from biblical accounts of the garden of Eden and the promised land offering a new home to Jews who had been held captive in Egypt were mobilised in relation to European colonisation. In the biblical context, these motifs emphasised God 2 ̆ 7 s cherishing <b>or</b> protection of <b>chosen</b> <b>people</b> {{to the exclusion of}} all others and so could be used to justify many forms of containment and exclusion in a colonial situation. The garden of Eden and the promised land also resonate as metaphors within a postcolonial context, and writers have drawn upon them when exploring issues of personal, national, and communal identity. Elizabeth Jolley engages in such exploration in her novel Milk and Honey as she presents Australia, not through the eyes of newly arrived colonists, but from the viewpoint of refugee migrants escaped from Europe during World War II. In a novel permeated with biblical allusion, she portrays the costs both of cultural and social exclusivity and of breaking down barriers erected to preserve identity...|$|R
40|$|Based {{on three}} case studies, we {{constructed}} an inductive process model of collective turnover, those instances in organizational life when two <b>or</b> more <b>people</b> <b>choose</b> {{to leave their}} organization in close temporal proximity based on shared social processes. The model highlights three phases through which an escalating interaction process that culminates in collective turnover unfolds. First, two or more members of an organizational group experience unresolved dissatisfaction with some aspect of their organization. Second, individual negative experiences are transformed into shared group perceptions through group sensemaking and emotional contagion that occurs in cohesive groups that view themselves as superior to others. Third, when group members feel no hope of improvement but have other opportunities available and few constraints on leaving, they collectively decide to leave their organization, begin searching for placements, and, turn over. We propose theoretical and practical implications of this model...|$|R
