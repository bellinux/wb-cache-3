He ordered the first officer on the scene, Lieutenant Williams, to bring him a soldier suspected <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>one</b> of the mutiny's ringleaders. Pinning the man with a sabre, Williams took him into custody. The other suspected mutineers were also captured.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, several {{properties}} on Park Lane {{were hit}} by bombs. Dudley House, at No.100, suffered major structural damage, including {{the destruction of the}} ballroom and gallery, though the building was partially restored. However, the strength of construction of the Dorchester Hotel gave it the reputation <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>one</b> of London's safest buildings, and it was a safe haven for numerous luminaries. General Dwight D. Eisenhower took a suite on the first floor in 1942, and later made it his headquarters.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Riefenstahl {{published}} a book of her sub-aquatic photographs called Korallengärten ("Coral Gardens"), followed by the 1990 book Wunder unter Wasser ("Wonder under Water"). In her 90s, Riefenstahl was still photographing marine life and gained the distinction <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>one</b> of the world's oldest scuba divers. On 22 August 2002, her 100th birthday, she released the film Impressionen unter Wasser ("Underwater Impressions"), an idealized documentary {{of life in the}} oceans and her first film in over 25 years. Riefenstahl was a member of Greenpeace for eight years.|$|E

5|$|In late October, Andrić {{left for}} Belgrade. He became {{involved}} in the city's literary circles and soon acquired the distinction <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>one</b> of Belgrade's most popular young writers. Though the Belgrade press wrote positively of him, Andrić disliked being a public figure, and went into seclusion and distanced himself from his fellow writers. At the same time, he grew dissatisfied with his government job and wrote to Alaupović asking for a transfer to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On 20 February, Andrić's request was granted and he was assigned to the Foreign Ministry's mission at the Vatican.|$|E
5|$|The area {{appears to}} have been of some {{importance}} in the early Christian period, as evidenced by the Pictish stone carvings found during the restoration of St Vigeans Church, and now housed in the small museum there. The stones had been used in the building of the old church and many had been badly damaged. One of the stones, the 9th century Drosten Stone, has the distinction <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>one</b> of the few Pictish artefacts to have an inscription in Latin text: 'DROSTEN: IREUORET TTFOR CUS', which has been interpreted in various ways, but it is thought to refer to the Pictish King Uurad, who reigned between 839 and 842AD.|$|E
5|$|After {{repeated}} {{attempts to}} reach Derek on his phone, Sharon finds Derek {{at the hospital}} and suspects that he and Lisa had an affair, as Lisa claims. LAPD Detective Monica Reese (Christine Lahti) at first questions Derek's fidelity to Sharon as well, but soon becomes skeptical of Lisa's claims, due to inconsistencies in her side of the story, and informs Derek of her belief in him. Sharon, refusing to believe Derek, kicks him out of their house, and he moves into a separate apartment. Months later, Derek and Sharon meet up for dinner and finally reconcile. Meanwhile, Lisa tricks the babysitter Samantha (Scout Taylor-Compton) into letting her in under the pretense <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>one</b> of Sharon's friends. When Derek and Sharon return home after dinner, they discover that Lisa had been in the house and seemingly abducted Derek and Sharon's infant son, Kyle (Nathan and Nicolas Myers). Derek goes to his car with the intent to pursue Lisa, only to find the baby is safely sitting in the back seat. He and Sharon immediately take Kyle to the hospital for a check-up. When Derek and Sharon return home from the hospital, they find Lisa has trashed their bedroom and removed Sharon's face from their family portrait. Sharon leaves a threatening voice message on Lisa's phone, and she and Derek set up a home alarm system.|$|E

5|$|In 1820 Accum {{began the}} public {{struggle}} against harmful food additives with his book entitled A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons. Some additives derived from plants, {{and used as}} preservatives or to alter tastes or appearance, had already been in use for some time. The beginning of the 19th century saw a rapid increase in the industrial preparation and packaging of foods. The drastic increase of additives used in these processes became a serious health concern. The production and distribution of food, instead <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>one</b> between local farmers and townspeople, increasingly became a centralized process in large factories. The proliferation of newly discovered chemicals {{and the absence of}} laws moderating their use, made it possible for unscrupulous merchants to use them to boost profits at a cost to the public health. Accum was the first to publicly proclaim the hazards of this practice and to reach a wide audience with his concerns.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} {{mountain}} tourists, ease of access {{into the high}} mountain environment, plus promotion and encouragement by tour companies offering ascents of Mont Blanc to people {{with little or no}} previous alpine experience, have led to an increase in mountain accidents and even inappropriate demands to be rescued. With up to 30,000 climbing parties now attempting to ascend Mont Blanc each year, it has gained the reputation <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>one</b> of the world's deadliest mountains. Deaths from mountaineering-related accidents across the Mont Blanc massif average almost 100 a year, with the majority occurring on Mont Blanc itself. There have also been various stunts, some of which the local authorities have decried as reckless or stupid. In recent years, guards have been placed on the most popular route of ascent to Mont Blanc's summit at peak periods {{in order to ensure that}} those entering the mountain environment are adequately equipped and skilled. This has led to calls to limit access to the most popular summits and for the mountains to be treated with greater respect.|$|E
5|$|The {{award of}} the 2012 Summer Olympics to London {{has brought the}} {{question}} of British participation in the football tournaments to the fore, given that there is traditionally no single British national football team. The British Olympic Association initially refused {{to rule out the}} possibility of entry for 2008, but were unable to come to an agreement with the Scottish Football Association. The 2007 European Under-21 Championship, which served as the European qualifying tournament for the men's competition, saw the England U-21 team reach the semi-finals, which would have meant a place at the Olympics. Because at the Olympics the team is representative of the entire UK, England were thus prevented from taking this place, with instead a play-off taking place between Portugal and Italy. A similar situation occurred with the England Women's team who, by virtue <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>one</b> of the top three European sides at the 2007 World Cup, would have been granted a place at the Olympics. Instead, there was a play-off between Denmark and Sweden.|$|E

5|$|The second Avrocar had logged about 75 {{flight hours}} {{at the end of}} the flight testing. Judged by its performance, the Avrocar was an abject failure: it couldn't lift itself safely more than a few feet off the ground, and its bulbous design {{limiting}} high-speed performance accompanied by unbearable heat and screaming exhaust noise, made it impractical for the military. Although considered a technical failure, its design would be prophetic: it was a rubber skirt shy <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>one</b> of the world's first hovercraft, the Saunders Roe SR.N1 also taking off in 1959. Nevertheless, company designer John Frost applied for a number of patents in Canada, the UK and the U.S. that established the pivotal role that the Avrocar and related Avro experimental vehicles made in the VTOL world.|$|E
