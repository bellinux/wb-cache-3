50|$|There is {{potential}} for <b>Olopatadine</b> {{as a treatment}} modality for steroid rebound (red skin syndrome).|$|E
50|$|Dual-action {{medications}} {{are also}} prescribed frequently. <b>Olopatadine</b> (Patanol) and ketotifen fumarate (Alaway or Zaditor) both provide protection by acting as an antihistamine and a mast cell stabilizer together. Patanol is a prescription medication, whereas ketotifen fumarate is not.|$|E
50|$|In studies {{comparing}} {{the effectiveness of}} <b>olopatadine</b> to alcaftadine, {{there was not a}} dose response increase of adverse effects as alcaftadine doses increases for 0.05% to 0.1% to 0.25%. The most common seen side effect of alcaftadine administration was irritation or a stinging sensation at the administration site.|$|E
50|$|When Alcaftadine {{was tested}} against placebo and <b>olopatadine,</b> only Alcaftadine 0.25% {{was shown to}} have a {{clinically}} significant reduction in conjunctival redness scores 7 and 15 minutes after administration. When clinical groups where compared to placebo, treatment with {{all three of the}} alcaftadine groups (0.05, 0.1 and 0.25%) showed a reduction in secondary endpoints of (lid swelling, conjunctival redness, ocular itching/tearing) as compared to placebo.|$|E
50|$|<b>Olopatadine</b> {{hydrochloride}} is an antihistamine (as well as anticholinergic and {{mast cell}} stabilizer), {{sold as a}} prescription eye drop manufactured by Alcon {{in one of three}} strengths: 0.7% solution or Pazeo in the US, 0.2% solution or Pataday (also called Patanol S in some countries), and 0.1% or Patanol (also called Opatanol in some countries; Olopat in India). It is used to treat itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis (eye allergies). A steroid-free nasal spray formulation is sold as Patanase, which was approved by the FDA on April 15, 2008. It is also available as an oral tablet in Japan under the tradename Allelock, manufactured by Kyowa Hakko Kogyo.|$|E
50|$|Alcaftadine is an {{antagonist}} {{at three}} of the histamine receptors (1, 2 and 4). The main indication for Alcaftadine is for prevention of allergic conjunctivitis. By blocking these three receptors, Alcaftadine {{has been shown to}} significantly reduce the effects of allergens. This effect on histamine receptors seems to show lower rates of itching, eosinophil recruitment and redness after exposure to an allergen. The effect of alcaftadine seemed {{to reduce the amount of}} eosinophil cells significantly as compared to <b>olopatadine</b> 0.1%. When animal models were used to test alcaftadine, alcaftadine 0.25% seemed to show superior results for decreasing E-cadherin expression as compared to placebo. The reduction of E-cadherin means decreased junctions which would lead to progression of allergic conjunctivitis.|$|E
5000|$|Reduced {{expression}} of this protein has {{been implicated in}} cardiomyopathies, and left ventricular assist device-based therapy does not restore S100A1 levels in patients. S100A1 has shown promise as an early diagnostic biomarker for acute myocardial ischemia, presenting with a distinct timecourse in human plasma following an ischemic event relative to traditional markers creatine kinase, CKMB and troponin I. This injury-released, extracellular pool of S100A1 was investigated in neonatal murine cardiomyocytes and was shown to prevent apoptosis via an ERK1/2-dependent pathway, suggesting that the release of S100A1 from injured cells is an intrinsic survival mechanism for viable myocardium. [...] S100 has also shown promise as a biomarker for uncontrolled hyperoxic reoxygenation during cardiopulmonary bypass in infants with cyanotic heart disease and in adults. S100A1 gene transfer to engineered heart tissue was shown to augment contractile performance of the tissue implants, suggesting that S100A1 may be effective in facilitating cardiac tissue replacement therapy in heart failure patients. However, the clinical efficacy of this strategy remains to be determined.In addition, multiple drugs, including Pentamidine, Amlexanox, <b>Olopatadine,</b> Cromolyn, and Propanolol, are known to bind to S100A1, although their affinities are often in the mid-micromolar range.|$|E

40|$|Backgroud/Aims: Besides its {{anti-allergic}} properties as a histamine receptor antagonist, <b>olopatadine</b> stabilizes {{mast cells}} by inhibiting {{the release of}} chemokines. Since <b>olopatadine</b> bears amphiphilic features and is preferentially partitioned into the lipid bilayers of the plasma membrane, it would induce some morphological changes in mast cells and thus affect the process of exocytosis. Methods: Employing the standard patch-clamp whole-cell recording technique, we {{examined the effects of}} <b>olopatadine</b> and other anti-allergic drugs on the membrane capacitance (Cm) in rat peritoneal mast cells during exocytosis. Using confocal imaging of a water-soluble fluorescent dye, lucifer yellow, we also examined their effects on the deformation of the plasma membrane. Results: Low concentrations of <b>olopatadine</b> (1 or 10 µM) did not significantly affect the GTP-&# 947;-S-induced increase in the Cm. However, 100 µM and 1 mM <b>olopatadine</b> almost totally suppressed the increase in the Cm. Additionally, these doses completely washed out the trapping of the dye on the cell surface, indicating that <b>olopatadine</b> counteracted the membrane surface deformation induced by exocytosis. As shown by electron microscopy, <b>olopatadine</b> generated inward membrane bending in mast cells. Conclusion: This study provides electrophysiological evidence {{for the first time that}} <b>olopatadine</b> dose-dependently inhibits the process of exocytosis in rat peritoneal mast cells. Such mast cell stabilizing properties of <b>olopatadine</b> may be attributed to its counteracting effects on the plasma membrane deformation in degranulating mast cells...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the integrated efficacy and safety of <b>olopatadine</b> HCl 0. 77 % from a larger dataset by pooling data from the two individual CAC studies. Methods: Data were pooled from two phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double-masked, active- and vehicle-controlled CAC studies. The primary comparison was on ocular itching scores between <b>olopatadine</b> HCl 0. 77 % versus vehicle (at onset and 24 hours) and <b>olopatadine</b> HCl 0. 77 % versus <b>olopatadine</b> 0. 2 % (at 24 hours). Additional end points included conjunctival redness, total redness, and proportion of itching responders at onset and 24 -hour duration of CAC. For both primary and secondary analysis, mixed model repeated measures analysis was used, except for proportion of ocular itching responders. Sensitivity analyses were carried out using a two-sample t-test. Results: This analysis included 448 patients. <b>Olopatadine</b> HCl 0. 77 % was superior to vehicle (P< 0. 0001) at onset and 24 -hour duration of action (difference in means: - 1. 14 to - 1. 52) and to <b>olopatadine</b> 0. 2 % (P= 0. 0009) at 24 -hour duration of action in relieving ocular itch. Additionally, <b>olopatadine</b> HCl 0. 77 % substantially reduced conjunctival redness and total redness over vehicle and <b>olopatadine</b> 0. 2 % at onset and 24 -hour duration of action. At 24 hours CAC, there were a higher proportion of itching responders with <b>olopatadine</b> HCl 0. 77 % compared to vehicle or <b>olopatadine</b> 0. 2 % (difference in proportion of responders: 43. 17 %, P< 0. 0001, and 17. 25 %, P= 0. 0012, respectively).

Objective: To compare the safety and efficacy of <b>olopatadine</b> 0. 77 % with vehicle or <b>olopatadine</b> 0. 2 % in patients with allergic conjunctivitis in a conjunctival allergen-challenge clinical study. Patients and methods: In this Phase III, multicenter, double-masked, parallel-group, randomized trial, patients with allergic conjunctivitis received <b>olopatadine</b> 0. 77 %, its vehicle, or <b>olopatadine</b> 0. 2 %, administered once at visits 3 A (day 0), 4 A (day 14 ± 2), and 5 (day 21 + 3). Allergic conjunctivitis-associated sign and symptom assessments included ocular itching, conjunctival redness, total redness, chemosis, and tearing scores. Adverse events and ocular safety parameters were also assessed. Results: A total of 202 qualifying patients were randomized. <b>Olopatadine</b> 0. 77 % was superior (P< 0. 001) to vehicle for treatment of ocular itching at 3, 5, and 7 minutes postchallenge at onset of action and 16 - and 24 -hour duration of action.

40|$|<b>Olopatadine</b> {{hydrochloride}} (<b>olopatadine)</b> is an antiallergic drug with histamine H 1 receptor antagonistic activity. Recently, <b>olopatadine</b> {{has been}} shown to bind to S 100 A 12 which {{is a member of the}} S 100 family of calcium-binding proteins, and exerts multiple proinflammatory activities including chemotaxis for monocytes and neutrophils. In this study, we examined the possibility that the interaction of <b>olopatadine</b> with S 100 A 12 inhibits the proinflammatory effects of S 100 A 12. Pretreatment of <b>olopatadine</b> with S 100 A 12 reduced migration of THP- 1, a monocyte cell line, induced by S 100 A 12 alone, but did not affect recombinant human regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) -induced migration. Amlexanox, which also binds to S 100 A 12, inhibited the THP- 1 migration induced by S 100 A 12.

40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundOlopatadine {{hydrochloride}} is an antiallergic {{agent with}} histamine H 1 receptor antagonistic action. We investigated {{the effects of}} <b>olopatadine</b> on passive anaphylaxis reaction- and compound 48 / 80 -induced conjunctivitis in rats. MethodsAllergic conjunctivitis was induced in rats passively sensitized by injection of rat anti-ovalbumin (anti-OVA) serum into the upper subconjunctiva of the right eye, followed by intravenous administration of the antigen and Evans blue dye. After 30 min, the amount of dye leaking into the conjunctiva was measured. Non-allergic conjunctivitis was induced in rats by injection of compound 48 / 80. <b>Olopatadine</b> or other reference compounds were orally given 1 h before the challenge. ResultsThe amount of dye leaking into the conjunctiva following passive anaphylaxis was significantly inhibited by oral administration of 0. 01 - 1 mg/kg <b>olopatadine</b> and the ID 50 value was 0. 093 mg/kg. In the control group, pathological examination revealed edema and lymphocyte infiltration in the conjunctiva and the palpebral skin. <b>Olopatadine,</b> at 0. 03 and 0. 3 mg/kg, reduced the grade of these pathological findings. The other antiallergic drugs (1 mg/kg loratadine, 0. 3 mg/kg epinastine, 0. 3 mg/kg cetiridine, 1 mg/kg ebastine, 30 mg/kg fexofenadine and 3 mg/kg chlorpheniramine), when administered orally, inhibited the passive anaphylaxis reaction-induced vascular hyperpermeability of the conjunctiva, {{as was the case}} with <b>olopatadine</b> hydrochloride.

40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundVarious mediators, such as {{thromboxane}} (TX) A 2, peptide leukotrienes (P-LT) and histamine, {{are involved}} in allergic nasal obstruction. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the mechanism whereby <b>olopatadine</b> hydrochloride, a novel anti-allergic drug, ameliorated the allergic nasal obstruction. MethodsThe levels of TXB 2, P-LT and histamine in nasal lavage fluid (NLF) were measured after intranasal antigen challenge in sensitized guinea pigs. ResultsHistamine and TXB 2 levels in the NLF increased eight- and threefold, respectively, 10 min after antigen challenge, whereas the P-LT level was under the detection limit. Oral administration of <b>olopatadine</b> at 0. 1, 1 and 3 mg/kg significantly inhibited the increases in TXB 2 and histamine levels. At 3 mg/kg, <b>olopatadine</b> also ameliorated the nasal obstruction caused 10 min after antigen challenge, as determined by acoustic rhinometry. ConclusionsThese results suggest that the amelioration by <b>olopatadine</b> of the allergic nasal obstruction involves the inhibition of the release of TXA 2 and histamine...|$|E

Methods: This study was designed to assess the optimal dose of <b>olopatadine</b> to suppress symptoms of chronic urticarial itch in well-controlled patients. After CU patients were treated with 10 mg <b>olopatadine,</b> patients having a visual analogue scale (VAS) itch score of less than 20 were randomly allocated into one of three groups: 10 mg/day (n = 35), 5 mg/day (n = 30), or no medication (n = 32). Results: The suppressive effects of both the 5 mg and 10 mg <b>olopatadine</b> treatments on the VAS itch score were more significant and longer lasting over a period of 4 weeks than the no-medication treatment. Both the 5 -mg group and the 10 -mg group showed improved urticarial symptoms and maintained their VAS itch score within normal limits compared to the no-medication group. The differences between the 5 -mg and 10 -mg groups were not significant. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that treatment with <b>olopatadine</b> at a dose of 5 mg once daily is effective and safe for the management and prevention of CU symptoms for itch in well-controlled patients.

Subjects and methods: This was a prospective, randomized, case-control study involving two institutions. The subjects were patients diagnosed with SAC at two institutions between February and March in 2014. To examine the clinical effects of seasonal treatment, 0. 05 % epinastine and 0. 1 % <b>olopatadine</b> were administered, and their effects were investigated every 2  weeks (Stage 1). To {{evaluate the}} clinical effects of preseasonal therapy, in January 2015, the same eye drop preparations as adopted in Stage 1 were administered to patients {{who had participated in}} Stage 1 and provided consent to participate in this study, and their effects were investigated every month (Stage 2). Results: In Stage 1, the 0. 05 % epinastine group consisted of 43 patients, and the 0. 1 % <b>olopatadine</b> group consisted of 42 patients. There were significant improvements in the total symptom and objective finding scores at each time point after administration in comparison with those before its baseline, but {{there were no significant differences}} between the two groups. In Stage 2, the 0. 05 % epinastine group consisted of 15 patients, and the 0. 1 % <b>olopatadine</b> group consisted of 14  patients. The rate of change in the total symptom score in comparison with that at the baseline of preseasonal treatment was significantly higher in the 0. 1 % <b>olopatadine</b> group 1 month after the start of treatment, suggesting symptom deterioration (P= 0. 025). There was no significant difference in the rate of change in the total objective finding score between the two groups. Conclusion: Seasonal treatment with 0. 05 % epinastine or 0. 1 % <b>olopatadine</b> was equally effective for patients with allergic conjunctivitis.

Objective: To evaluate <b>olopatadine</b> 0. 2 % versus its vehicle in the complete prevention of ocular itching in adult patients with allergic conjunctivitis. Methods: This paper presents a post-hoc analysis of subgroup results from a single-center, double-masked, randomized, contralateral eye, conjunctival allergen challenge study. The post-hoc efficacy analysis, conducted with data from patients who instilled <b>olopatadine</b> 0. 2 % in a single eye and vehicle in the contralateral eye, compared the ability of each study formulation to completely prevent ocular itching at three assessment time points post-instillation. Safety was not reevaluated in the post-hoc analysis. Results: Overall, 40 patients received contralateral instillations of study drug and were included in the post-hoc analysis. At all three post-instillation time points, significantly greater proportions of patients reported itching scores of 0 in the <b>olopatadine</b> 0. 2 %-treated eye than in the vehicle-treated eye (63 %&ndash; 65 % versus 3 %&ndash; 10 %, respectively; P &lt; 0. 05 for each comparison).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ocular allergies cause itching, redness, chemosis, tearing, and {{swelling}} of the eyelids in sensitized individuals. The options available for treatment of ocular allergy include <b>olopatadine</b> 0. 1 % (Opatanol; Patanol [US]) and ketotifen 0. 025 % (Zaditen; Zaditor [US]). Patient preference for an eye drop can often be a primary factor in determining the level of compliance and satisfaction with any given therapy. OBJECTIVE: This study sought patient perspective on eye drop efficacy in controlling {{signs and symptoms of}} allergic conjunctivitis and eye drop comfort. Also evaluated were the factors considered by patients when making decisions of preference. METHODS: One hundred patients with previous history and current symptoms of seasonal or perennial allergic conjunctivitis were enrolled at two centers (Athens, Greece, N = 50; Padova, Italy, N = 50) for this two visit, double-masked study. Qualified patients received two masked bottles of medication (one <b>olopatadine,</b> one ketotifen) and were asked to use both medications as needed over the course of four weeks, but not to exceed usage of two drops of medication per eye per day. At the second visit, patients answered five questions comparing the two masked medications in terms of preference, drop comfort, and efficacy in treatment of signs and symptoms. Patients also defined the factors upon which they based these decisions. RESULTS: A significantly greater percentage of patients (81 %) selected <b>olopatadine</b> when asked which medication they preferred; which they found more comfortable; which they found more efficacious in reducing symptoms of allergy; and which they would select if visiting the doctor's office (P < 0. 0001). Seventy-six percent (76 %) of patients considered both efficacy and comfort when making their preference decisions (P < 0. 0001). No adverse events were volunteered or elicited. CONCLUSION: In this study, patients preferred to use the anti-allergy eye drop <b>olopatadine</b> over ketotifen after using both drops and evaluating relative efficacy and comfort during the course of four weeks. A significantly greater percentage of the patients preferred to use <b>olopatadine</b> during the study period, found it more efficacious and comfortable, and would select <b>olopatadine</b> if visiting their doctor's office during allergy seaso...|$|E
