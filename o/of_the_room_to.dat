25|$|With {{the advent}} of the chimney, the hearth moved from the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> one wall, and the first brick-and-mortar hearths were built. The fire was lit on top of the construction; a vault {{underneath}} served to store wood. Pots made of iron, bronze, or copper started to replace the pottery used earlier. The temperature was controlled by hanging the pot higher or lower over the fire, or placing it on a trivet or directly on the hot ashes. Using open fire for cooking (and heating) was risky; fires devastating whole cities occurred frequently.|$|E
25|$|The {{basement}} proper was {{one hundred}} {{feet long and}} forty feet wide with six rooms of varying sized on either side. The sides of the rooms were stone and abutted the massive stone piers that supported the floors above. With {{the exception of the}} two rooms at the West end of the basement, reportedly used for clerical purposes, each side room rose two steps in height from the basement floor. The rooms were dressing rooms for those using the font. The floor was made of red brick laid in a herringbone pattern. The walls were painted white. The floor sloped down to the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> allow water to run toward a drain beneath the font.|$|E
25|$|Later {{that night}} in Callahan's office, the interns {{celebrate}} Elle's skill. Warner finds problems with calling a finely tuned awareness of homosexuality a legal victory. Callahan, annoyed with Warner's behavior, sends Warner out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> fetch a coffee. Callahan dismisses Emmett and the other interns but requests Elle to remain for a few moments. Callahan forcibly kisses Elle, who slaps him. In turn, Callahan fires her. Warner and Vivienne both see the kiss {{through the door of}} the room. Warner turns away in anger, leaving Vivienne to be the only one to witness the slap. After Callahan leaves, Warner re-enters the office and mocks Elle, but Vivienne tells him to shut up and they both leave. A defeated Elle prepares to go home, despite Emmett asking her to stay, finally realizing that he is in love with her ("Legally Blonde").|$|E

25|$|Islamic {{rule over}} {{northern}} and central India {{brought with it}} the use of domes constructed with stone, brick and mortar, and iron dowels and cramps. Centering was made from timber and bamboo. The use of iron cramps to join together adjacent stones was known in pre-Islamic India, and was used {{at the base of}} domes for hoop reinforcement. The synthesis of styles created by this introduction of new forms to the Hindu tradition of trabeate construction created a distinctive architecture. Domes in pre-Mughal India have a standard squat circular shape with a lotus design and bulbous finial at the top, derived from Hindu architecture. Because the Hindu architectural tradition did not include arches, flat corbels were used to transition from the corners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> the dome, rather than squinches. In contrast to Persian and Ottoman domes, the domes of Indian tombs tend to be more bulbous.|$|E
25|$|The Great Hall is sited on the castle's {{southern}} side, {{where some}} of the more visible remains still stand. This was a large room used for dining and receiving visitors. Its much enlarged windows still look south across the valley and an arched gateway leads from the west end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> what was once the Kitchens {{in the basement of the}} adjacent apsidal ('D' shaped) tower. This tower, called the Welsh Tower, is a typical feature of Welsh castles of the period. It would have protruded from the castle wall into the defensive ditch and provided archers with a clear view of any attackers attempting to approach the southern wall. The tower had perhaps three storeys with living quarters on the upper floors. In the south western corner was a Postern gate. This was an additional exit from the castle, designed to be used in times of siege to allow the garrison to 'sally' out and attack their besiegers. Fragments of the arch remain as well as the slot for the door's drawbar.|$|E

Therefore, as George Washington stated, the {{document}} was executed by [...] "eleven states, and Colonel Hamilton."

500|$|Chapman died on 4 October 1989 in Maidstone Hospital.

500|$|The Doctor hears Donna {{scream and}} turns {{up in the}} booth. After {{examining}} the beetle, the Doctor comments on how it was odd for an alternate universe to form around her, explaining that the beetle worked for The Trickster with the job of changing people's lives in various ways. His remarks cause Donna to recall Rose and her message, which she delivers to the Doctor. Rose told her two words, [...] "Bad Wolf". A panicked Doctor, realising who Donna must have met, runs out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> find the words [...] "Bad Wolf" [...] written everywhere once again. He rushes into the TARDIS only to hear the cloister bell, and announces {{that the universe is}} in danger.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{traditional}} beliefs of many Malagasy ethnic groups, one attains the status of [...] "ancestor" [...] after death. [...] It is often believed that ancestors continue to watch over and shape events on Earth and can intervene on behalf of (or interfere with) the living. [...] As a consequence, ancestors are to be revered: prayers and sacrifices to honor or appease them are common, {{as well as the}} observation of the local fady (taboos) the ancestors may have established in life. Gestures of respect, such as throwing the first capful of a new bottle of rum into the northeast corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> share it with the ancestors, are practiced throughout the island. The most visible emblem of the respect due to ancestors is the construction of the elaborate family tombs that dot the countryside in much of Madagascar.|$|E

500|$|As Alison, {{who managed}} to free herself, calls Lawrence at gunpoint again, she fights Zep for the gun. The {{struggle}} gets Tapp's attention, and he saves Alison and Diana and chases Zep to the sewers, where he is eventually shot in the chest during a struggle. Lawrence, aware only of gunshots and screaming, is electrically shocked as well and loses reach of the phone; in desperation, he saws off his foot and shoots Adam with the corpse's revolver. Zep enters the bathroom to kill Lawrence, stating that [...] "It's the rules", but Adam, who suffered only a flesh wound, overpowers Zep and bludgeons him to death with the toilet cover. As Lawrence crawls out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> find help, Adam searches Zep's body for a key and finds another microcassette recorder, which reveals that Zep was another victim, following the rules of his own game to obtain an antidote for a slow-acting poison in his body. As the tape ends, the [...] "corpse" [...] rises and is revealed to be Lawrence's patient John, the real Jigsaw killer. He reveals {{that the key to}} Adam's chain was in the bathtub he woke up in, which was drained when Adam awoke. Adam attempts to shoot John with Zep's gun, but John activates a remote, briefly electrocuting Adam. John shuts off the lights, while Adam screams in terror as John slams the door shut, leaving him to die.|$|E

2500|$|Disdemona's {{death in}} Cinthio is strikingly {{different}} from Desdemona's death in Shakespeare. [...] The poet's gentle scene between Desdemona and Emilia while preparing for bed {{does not exist}} in Cinthio, and Cinthio's murder of Disdemona is accomplished when the Moor commissions his ensign to bludgeon Disdemona to death with a sand-filled stocking. [...] The two murderers then place her lifeless body upon her bed, smash her skull, and cause the cracked ceiling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> collapse upon her, giving the impression that the lady's skull was smashed by falling rafters.|$|E
2500|$|Page {{reportedly}} used natural room ambience {{to enhance}} the reverb and recording texture on the record, demonstrating the innovations in sound recording he had learned during his session days. Up until the late 1960s, most music producers placed microphones {{directly in front of}} the amplifiers and drums. For Led Zeppelin, Page developed the idea of placing an additional microphone some distance from the amplifier (as far as twenty feet) and then recording the balance between the two. By adopting this [...] "distance equals depth" [...] technique, Page became one of the first producers to record a band's [...] "ambient sound": the distance of a note's time-lag from one end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> the other.|$|E
2500|$|The {{story is}} {{about a woman who}} suffers from mental illness after three months of being closeted in a room by her husband for the sake of her health. She becomes obsessed with the room's revolting yellow wallpaper. Gilman wrote this story to change people's minds about {{the role of women in}} society, {{illustrating}} how women's lack of autonomy is detrimental to their mental, emotional, and even physical wellbeing. [...] This story was inspired by her treatment from her first husband. The narrator in the story must do as her husband, who is also her doctor, demands, although the treatment he prescribes contrasts directly with what she truly needs — mental stimulation and the freedom to escape the monotony <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> which she is confined. [...] "The Yellow Wallpaper" [...] was essentially a response to the doctor who had tried to cure her of her depression through a [...] "rest cure", Dr. Silas Weir Mitchell, and she sent him a copy of the story.|$|E

2500|$|Mike Judge {{once said}} in an {{interview}} that Beavis [...] "is a zero" [...] when it comes to intelligence; indeed, Beavis is often oblivious to what should be obvious. Generally submissive to Butt-Head and willing to tolerate a large amount of physical and verbal abuse, Beavis nonetheless has limits. In [...] "Murder Site", Beavis was driven to attack and nearly kill Butt-Head, who ceaselessly called him [...] "Butt-knocker", a term which Beavis resents. Beavis also stood up to Butt-Head while they were watching the video for Rancid's [...] "Nihilism": Butt-Head kept talking about it derisively, prompting Beavis to tell Butt-Head to shut up. When Butt-Head reacted with fury, ordering Beavis never again to tell him to shut up and threatening to attack him, Beavis preemptively kicked Butt-Head in the testicles, told him to shut up again, and walked out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> get something to eat. In another episode, while the duo were watching a Bon Jovi video, Beavis claimed to like one part of the song, causing Butt-Head to slap him in disgust. After being struck a few times, Beavis kicked Butt-Head in the groin and proclaimed [...] "Bon Jovi rules!".|$|E
2500|$|He {{developed}} a reputation for employing effects in new ways and trying out different methods of using microphones and amplification. During the late 1960s, most British music producers placed microphones {{directly in front of}} amplifiers and drums, resulting in the sometimes [...] "tinny" [...] sound of the recordings of the era. Page commented to Guitar World magazine that he felt the drum sounds of the day in particular [...] "sounded like cardboard boxes." [...] Instead, Page was a fan of 1950s recording techniques, Sun Studios being a particular favourite. In the same Guitar World interview, Page remarked: [...] "Recording used to be a science" [...] and [...] " [...] used to have a maxim: distance equals depth." [...] Taking this maxim to heart, Page developed the idea of placing an additional microphone some distance from the amplifier (as much as twenty feet) and then recording the balance between the two. By adopting this technique, Page {{became one of the first}} British producers to record a band's [...] "ambient sound" [...] – the distance of a note's time-lag from one end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> the other.|$|E
2500|$|Going to {{the small}} {{telephone}} box with its slender wire attachments, Mr. Bell coolly asked, as though addressing someone in an adjoining room, [...] "Mr. Watson, are you ready!" [...] Mr. Watson, five miles away in Somerville, promptly answered in the affirmative, and soon was heard a voice singing [...] "America". [...] Going to another instrument, connected by wire with Providence, forty-three miles distant, Mr. Bell listened a moment, and said, [...] "Signor Brignolli, who is assisting at a concert in Providence Music Hall, will now sing for us." [...] In a moment the cadence of the tenor's voice rose and fell, the sound being faint, sometimes lost, and then again audible. Later, a cornet solo played in Somerville was very distinctly heard. Still later, a three-part song came over the wire from Somerville, and Mr. Bell told his audience [...] "I will switch off the song from one part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> another so that all can hear." [...] At a subsequent lecture in Salem, Massachusetts, communication was established with Boston, eighteen miles distant, and Mr. Watson at the latter place sang [...] "Auld Lang Syne", the National Anthem, and [...] "Hail Columbia", while the audience at Salem joined in the chorus.|$|E
