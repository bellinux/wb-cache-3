5|$|In 1942, in {{its most}} {{significant}} schism, at least 250 members left the Church. Tensions began to build after Joaquín's birthday, when the congregation gave him gifts of flowers and sang hymns celebrating his birthday. This celebration generated a heated debate that culminated with the defection of several church members, including some pastors. Anthropologist Renée de la Torre described this schism as a power struggle in which Joaquín was accused of having enriched himself {{at the expense of}} the faithful. Church dissidents took to El Occidental to accuse members <b>of</b> <b>La</b> Luz del Mundo of committing immoralities with young women. Some of the accusations were aimed to close down a temple that LLDM used with government permission. Members <b>of</b> <b>La</b> Luz del Mundo attribute this episode to the envy and ambition of the dissidents, who formed their own group called El Buen Pastor (The Good Shepherd) under the leadership of José María González, with doctrines and practices similar to those <b>of</b> <b>La</b> Luz del Mundo.
