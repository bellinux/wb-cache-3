5|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Narayan's {{writings}} {{tend to be more}} descriptive and less analytical; the objective style, rooted in a detached spirit, providing for a more authentic and realistic narration. His attitude, coupled with his perception of life, provided a unique ability to fuse characters and actions, and an ability to use ordinary events to create a connection in the mind <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader.</b> A significant contributor to his writing style was his creation of Malgudi, a stereotypical small town, where the standard norms of superstition and tradition apply.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1981 season, Greer {{underwent}} {{a number of}} renovations including the addition of over 1,200box seats and over 1,000new general admission seats. Two wooden general admission seating areas were replaced by 2,000contoured seats. The original backstop which consisted of several steel poles was upgraded to a steel cable system, eliminating most of the poles. Other stadium upgrades included two new dugouts, three entrance and exit ramps, a new sound system, doubling the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> panel on the scoreboard, and enlarging the ticket booth. The ballpark's attendance record was set on August 18, 1982, when 22,315people watched the Sounds play against the Columbus Astros.|$|E

5|$|Recently, postmodernism {{has come}} to convey more {{completely}} prose and poetry as distinct entities, and also among genres of poetry, as having meaning only as cultural artifacts. Postmodernism goes beyond modernism's emphasis on the creative role of the poet, to emphasize the role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> of a text (Hermeneutics), and to highlight the complex cultural web within which a poem is read. Today, throughout the world, poetry often incorporates poetic form and diction from other cultures and from the past, further confounding attempts at definition and classification that were once sensible within a tradition such as the Western canon.|$|E

25|$|In {{the opinion}} of Sasha Sokolov:It seems he was only really {{appreciated}} by professionals. Living here and now, in Tel-Aviv, I remember our few meetings and frequently walk along Ben Yehuda Street, past his house... Sasha is difficult. He's not only difficult stylistically, but also philosophically. He offers up his immense knowledge without thinking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader,</b> without glancing back at him – a knowledge of art, science, philology, naturally. I can {{understand the value of}} his texts, but I don't understand how they were made.|$|E

25|$|The numerals are {{arranged}} with their lowest value digit to the right, with higher value positions {{added to the}} left. This arrangement was adopted identically into the numerals as used in Europe. Languages written in the Latin alphabet run from left-to-right, unlike languages written in the Arabic alphabet. Hence, {{from the point of}} view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader,</b> numerals in Western texts are written with the highest power of the base first whereas numerals in Arabic texts are written with the lowest power of the base first.|$|E
25|$|The type of book being {{produced}} determines {{the amount of}} design required. For standard fiction titles, the design is usually restricted to typography and cover design. For books containing illustrations or images, design takes on a much larger role in laying out how the page looks, how chapters begin and end, colours, typography, cover design and ancillary materials such as posters, catalogue images, and other sales materials. Non-fiction illustrated titles are the most design intensive books, requiring extensive use of images and illustrations, captions, typography and a deep involvement and consideration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> experience.|$|E
25|$|This article first {{presents}} a simple {{set of rules}} which are, except for wording, identical to those usually {{referred to as the}} Tromp–Taylor Rules, themselves close in most essential respects to the Chinese rules.

Later sections of the article address major areas of variation in the rules of go, and individual sets of rules.|$|E

25|$|The Bridge of Asses (Pons Asinorum) {{states that}} in {{isosceles}} triangles the angles {{at the base}} equal one another, and, if the equal straight lines are produced further, then the angles under the base equal one another. Its name {{may be attributed to}} its frequent role as the first real test in the Elements of the intelligence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> and as a bridge to the harder propositions that followed. It might also be so named because of the geometrical figure's resemblance to a steep bridge that only a sure-footed donkey could cross.|$|E
25|$|However, read {{range is}} both a {{function}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> and the tag itself. Improvements in technology may increase read ranges for tags. Tags may be read at longer ranges than they are designed for by increasing reader power. The limit on read distance then becomes the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal reflected from the tag back to the reader. Researchers at two security conferences have demonstrated that passive Ultra-HighFID tags normally read at ranges of up to 30 feet, can be read at ranges of 50 to 69 feet using suitable equipment.|$|E
25|$|Radio-frequency {{identification}} (RFID) uses {{electromagnetic fields}} to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. The tags contain electronically stored information. Passive tags collect energy {{from a nearby}} RFID reader's interrogating radio waves. Active tags have a local power source (such as a battery) and may operate hundreds of meters from the RFID reader. Unlike a barcode, the tag need not be within the line of sight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader,</b> {{so it may be}} embedded in the tracked object. RFID is one method for Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC).|$|E
