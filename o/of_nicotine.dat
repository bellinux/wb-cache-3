5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} of lung {{adenocarcinoma}} started to rise relative to other types of lung cancer. This {{is partly due to}} the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive the same amount <b>of</b> <b>nicotine,</b> increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise. The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma continues to rise.|$|E
5|$|The Sale of Food (Prohibition of Chewing Gum) Regulations {{made under}} the Sale of Food Act prohibits the sale or {{advertisement}} for sale of any chewing gum. The prohibition {{does not apply}} to the sale or advertisement of any chewing gum in respect of which a product licence has been granted under the Medicines Act. Thus, it is now possible to purchase chewing gum for dental or medical purposes (for instance, for the purpose <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> replacement therapy) from pharmacies without a prescription.|$|E

50|$|Although {{knowledge}} <b>of</b> <b>nicotine’s</b> effects {{upon the}} appetite {{can contribute to}} people smoking for weight control purposes, studies have not shown that people smoke exclusively to maintain or lose weight.|$|R
50|$|Because {{cotinine}} is {{the main}} metabolite to nicotine and {{has been shown to}} be pharmacologically active, it has been suggested that some <b>of</b> <b>nicotine's</b> effects in the nervous system may be mediated by cotinine and/or complex interactions with nicotine itself.|$|R
5|$|The {{next most}} common use is {{as an aid}} for smoking cessation. Bupropion reduces the {{severity}} <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Bupropion is helpful for smoking cessation in smokers with no history of depression; thus, the effectiveness of bupropion is not due to its antidepressant effect. A typical bupropion treatment course lasts up to twelve weeks, with people halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. Bupropion approximately doubles the chance of quitting smoking successfully. The effectiveness of bupropion is comparable to nicotine replacement therapy, but less effective than varenicline.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{in females}} where {{ulceration}} is correlated to the menstrual cycle or to birth control pills, progestogen or {{a change in}} birth control may be beneficial. Use <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> replacement therapy {{for people who have}} developed oral ulceration after stopping smoking has also been reported. Starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition. Trauma can be reduced by avoiding rough or sharp foodstuffs and by brushing teeth with care. If sodium lauryl sulfate is suspected to be the cause, avoidance of products containing this chemical may be useful and prevent recurrence in some individuals. Similarly patch testing may indicate that food allergy is responsible, and the diet modified accordingly. If investigations reveal deficiency states, correction of the deficiency may result in resolution of the ulceration. For example, {{there is some evidence that}} vitamin B12 supplementation may prevent recurrence in some individuals.|$|E
25|$|A 1996 {{study on}} the effects <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> on {{cognitive}} performance revealed that findings <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> or smoking improving performance {{were more likely to}} be published by scientists who acknowledged tobacco industry support.|$|E
50|$|Rose elucidated {{the brain}} {{pharmacokinetics}} of inhaled nicotine: Rose et al. conducted the first direct {{assessment of the}} rate <b>of</b> brain <b>nicotine</b> uptake during cigarette smoking, using cigarettes spiked with the radiotracer 11Cnicotine and PET scanning to image nicotine in the brain. The results overturned the widely held “puff bolus” hypothesis, which held that the nicotine from each puff of smoke should generate aspike in brain nicotine uptake within 10 seconds. In fact, the lung serves as a depot for nicotine, releasing the dose over several minutes. This new understanding <b>of</b> brain <b>nicotine</b> pharmacokinetics has implications both for the understanding <b>of</b> mechanisms underlying <b>nicotine</b> addiction as well as development <b>of</b> more effective <b>nicotine</b> replacement strategies.|$|R

25|$|Most nightshades contain varying amounts <b>of</b> <b>nicotine,</b> a {{powerful}} neurotoxin to insects.

25|$|In late 2009, {{reports were}} {{released}} by the London-based human-rights group Plan International, claiming that child labor was common on Malawi (producer of 1.8% of the world's tobacco) tobacco farms. The organization interviewed 44 teens, who worked full-time on farms during the 2007-8 growing season. The child-laborers complained of low pay and long hours, {{as well as physical}} and sexual abuse by their supervisors. They also reported suffering from Green tobacco sickness, a form <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> poisoning. When wet leaves are handled, nicotine from the leaves gets absorbed in the skin and causes nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Children were exposed to 50-cigarettes-worth <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> through direct contact with tobacco leaves. This level <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> in children can permanently alter brain structure and function.|$|E
25|$|When a {{cigarette}} is smoked, nicotine-rich blood passes from the lungs {{to the brain}} within seven seconds and immediately stimulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; this indirectly promotes the release of many chemical messengers such as acetylcholine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, arginine vasopressin, serotonin, dopamine, and beta-endorphin in parts <b>of</b> the brain. <b>Nicotine</b> also extends the duration of positive effects of dopamine and increases {{the sensitivity of the}} brain's reward system to rewarding stimuli. Most cigarettes contain 1–3 milligrams <b>of</b> inhalable <b>nicotine.</b> Studies suggest that when smokers wish to achieve a stimulating effect, they take short quick puffs, which produce a low level <b>of</b> blood <b>nicotine.</b>|$|R

25|$|The primary {{therapeutic}} use <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> is in treating nicotine dependence {{in order to}} eliminate smoking with the damage it does to health.

Studies have found that these therapies increase the chance of success of quitting by 50 to 70%, though reductions in the population as a whole have not been demonstrated.|$|E

50|$|Nicotine {{dependence}} {{is a state}} <b>of</b> dependence upon <b>nicotine.</b> There {{are different}} ways <b>of</b> measuring <b>nicotine</b> dependence. Some nicotine dependence assessments focus on key physical dependence outcomes like the development of tolerance which allows people to smoke heavily. Other assessments ask about psychosocial outcomes or underlying mechanisms of dependence. These different assessments either characterize dependence as a continuous construct or use cut-offs to diagnose {{whether or not a}} person is dependent.|$|R
50|$|Nicotine {{is highly}} addictive. An average {{cigarette}} yields about 2 mg <b>of</b> absorbed <b>nicotine,</b> and in lesser doses of that order, the substance {{acts as a}} stimulant in mammals, while high amounts (50-100 mg) can be harmful. This stimulant effect is a contributing factor to the addictive properties <b>of</b> tobacco smoking. <b>Nicotine's</b> addictive nature includes psychoactive effects, drug-reinforced behavior, compulsive use, relapse after abstinence, physical dependence and tolerance.|$|R
25|$|Research {{has also}} shown that {{improved}} air quality translates to decreased toxin exposure among employees.
