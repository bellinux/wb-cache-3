40|$|USE OF VASOPRESSIN IN THE TREATMENT OF BLEEDING ESOPHAGEAL VARICES. OUR EXPERIENCES Results {{obtained}} in the control of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>varix</b> rupture haemorrhage by intravenous vasopressin perfusion or selective intraarterial administration are reported. This comparative study shows intravenous administration {{to be the best}} method since it produces the same therapeutic effects with fewer undesirable side-effects than when administered arterially. In view of the high level of complications caused by selective arterial catheters, this administration method would only appear justified in cases where selective arterial catheterisation is to be carried out in any case...|$|E
40|$|Gastric spiral organisms {{were first}} {{described}} in man in 1939 and identified as Helicobacter pylori causing peptic ulcers {{in the early}} 1980 s. Surgical specimens of gastric resections from 1939 showed H. pylori to be present. Full-thickness sections of gastric mucosa from gastric specimens from the eighteenth-century Hunterian Collection at The Royal College of Surgeons of England were examined by histology {{for the presence of}} H. pylori. Four gastric ulcers and a section from an <b>oesophageal</b> <b>varix</b> showed remarkable preservation of the overall architecture, but surface autolysis did not allow identification of the bacteria. However, the presence of lymphoid aggregates in the Hunterian specimens suggests that H. pylori may have been present before autolysis...|$|E
40|$|Spontaneous {{intramural}} dissection of the oesphagus {{is a rare}} condition. In {{this report}} we describe a patient with this lesion who was managed successfully without operation. As well as demonstrating the characteristic radiographic and endoscopic features, our case suggests that the inges-tion of solid unmasticated food {{may be an important}} aetiological feature that has not been emphasised in previ-ous publications. Case report A 70 year old edentulous woman presented as an emergency, complaining of acute onset of severe and worsening retrosternal pain. At lunchtime on that day she had eaten quickly a piece of lamb. She felt the food stick at the level of her manubrium and within a few minutes developed chest pain radiating from the manubrium to the epigastrium. She then vomited-initially clear fluid, fol-lowed by bright red blood in increasing quantities. Swal-lowing was noticed to exacerbate the pain. Finally the offending piece of lamb was vomited. On examination the trachea was tender to movement, but there was no surgical emphysema. Chest radiography and auscultation of the chest showed no abnormality. Abdominal examination also showed nothing abnormal. A barium swallow done two hours after admission showed a double barrelled " appearance (figure). Endoscopy, per-formed the same evening, showed a mucosal tear post-eriorly 15 cm from the alveolar margin, and from this lesion there was a bluish column that extended down to the oesophagogastric junction and looked rather like a single long <b>oesophageal</b> <b>varix.</b> Administration of intravenous fluids and parenteral broad spectrum antibiotics was started and the patient was allowed nothing by mouth. After 48 hours the odynophagia has subsided and at seven days, after a repeat barium swallow, oral fluids were commenced, followed by return to a normal diet. The patient left hospital after 10 days and at review one month later was symptom free, with no dysphagia or odynophagia...|$|E
