40|$|Raising market {{awareness}} CUE: Every {{year the}} world?s industries spend {{billions of dollars}} advertising their products: {{it is one of}} their most important marketing strategies. But what about small-scale farmers? Is advertising a strategy that they can use? One problem is that putting advertisements in newspapers or on the radio is usually quite expensive. However, for farmers who can group themselves and combine their resources, developing a strategy to raise awareness about their product may be a possibility. Our next report comes from The Gambia, where the National Beekeepers Association has found a number of ways of promoting their honey products. Through their work, consumers are now aware that honey comes in many different varieties with different tastes, and can even be good for their health! Ismaila Senghore spoke to the General Manager, Mr Abba Manneh, about how the association has increased the demand for honey in The Gambia. IN:		?When we established we ? OUT:		? and the malaina honey. DUR?N	 3 ? 00 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Abba Manneh describing the growing market for honey in The Gambia. Transcript Manneh	When we established we thought we should now try to sensitise people, so that we can increase demand. Because if we have more consumers locally, it means then the demand for the product will be also increased. Now we produced some information sheets informing them of the different sicknesses and diseases that honey can really cure. And the way they should go about taking honey to solve those problems Senghore	Do you locate specific places and specific markets that are advantageous to you and particular to you? Manneh	Yes! We started introducing the product also to the supermarkets and to the hotels, by way of getting some standard jars. And we also use labels. We label them, where we put our logo, and we put ?Natural Pure Gambian Honey, and underneath we put ?Organic?. Then our address, telephone, fax and so on, so that anybody who wants to contact us, can contact us at any time. We have started sensitising also the bakeries, so that they can also be using honey to coat their bread. Because {{it can be used to}} preserve bread for a longer period. Senghore	Now that is about your retailers and other clients, maybe wholesalers. Now what about the consumers? What do you focus on to make sure that the consumers are attracted to your product? Manneh	The consumers, we do make some sensitisation through the media, using ?The Observer? the radio and so on. And we also have a honey bench outside here which we display all the products, and anybody who comes to buy we try to sensitise. Senghore	Do they taste you honey to make sure that it is the one they like? Manneh	Yes! Now you see because Gambians were not aware of the different type of honeys that can be produced. But because of our existence, a lot of people now start to realise that honey has different colours, and why the different colours, is because they are coming from a different botanical source, and automatically they must have different taste. They will tell you either I would like mangrove honey - ?Do you have mangrove honey?? <b>or</b> ?<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> cashew honey?? <b>or</b> ?<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> malaina honey?? <b>or</b> ?<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> mahogany honey?? So it is not the colour that they ask for. It is only the Europeans who ask for a colour. They will go and say ?No, I want amber? or ?I want light amber? or ?I want dark honey?. Senghore	Which are the types that are most popular? Manneh	Well here the most popular types are the light honey and the amber honey. That is the colour. But for the Gambians what they normally ask for is mangrove honey and the malaina honey. End of track. The National Beekeepers? Association in The Gambia uses a variety of methods to promote its honey products. These include information sheets, advertisements in newspapers and on the radio, and an outdoor display table where customers can come to try different honey types...|$|E

When is demand highest, and how will you find, and keep, your customers? In The Gambia, the Indigenous Business Advisory Service, IBAS, has been supporting new businesses for over 30 years, giving both training and loans. Teaching business skills is a passion for Manka Sanyang, the IBAS manager, as Ismaila Senghore found out when he visited his office in Bakau. In Africa, where so many of us run small businesses of one sort or another, what are the business skills he likes to build? IN:	?Some people have their own business ? OUT:	? You are welcome. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 05 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Ismaila Senghore reporting from The Gambia. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Sanyang	Some people have their own business all right, but since the training started, people were voluntarily coming in to be trained. After they go through their training they say ?Hah! There are a lot of things that I thought I knew, but I really didn?t know. I was making a mistake all along. ? Because some people cannot distinguish their personal money from their business money. They?ll be doing their business, a relative will come and say there is a christening, or somebody died. They will just pull open their drawer and take money and give it to them, and you cannot do that. You are killing your business. It is not your money, it is the business?s money. These are the things we try to emphasise. Senghore	Can you please expand on the basic things that you train them on when they come? Sanyang	OK we train them how to locate their business and where to locate their business. How to select their business and where to look for funding. We train them how to handle their customers. Customer relationship is very important. It defines whether you will succeed or you will fail. We also train them how to recover their loans. If you go through our training programme it exposes you to various options and then you will know all the advantages and disadvantages, and where to acquire some of your basic raw materials or things to do with the business. After knowing all that it assists you to narrow down your choices in which area to go into. Senghore	Do you only deal with individuals <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> groups? Sanyang	Initially we were working with individuals, but as time goes on we started receiving requests from groups, especially female groups which we call kaffos. And then we are also helping a group of school leavers who have gone through NYSS. Senghore	NYSS is the National Youth Service Scheme? Sanyang	Yes. Some of their students who have acquired training either in carpentry or auto-mechanics or things of that sort. We try to establish a garage for them. We try to help them locate an area and then we help them establish a garage and then we buy the basic tools, and then provide them with a small working capital. And our extension staff are usually on the ground to monitor their progress, and they pay the loans as time goes on. Senghore	You have been into this for over 30 years now, and I?m sure along the way you must have had very good examples of, let?s say first of all, a successful case. Sanyang	OK, to give you a typical example of a successful case, is the poultry producers at the central prisons. They made an application. We went there and saw the area and appraised it, and then extended a loan to them. And they were able to purchase their day old chicks over there. The project was targeting the fast month. Senghore	Ramadan, the month of fasting, yes. Sanyang	The month of fasting. This was one of the successful cases which I?m very much proud of. These people acquired those chicks and we bought feed and gave it to them, and they also acquired drugs and treated all their chickens. And sure enough, come around Ramadan they hit the market. All their chickens were sold and they successfully paid their loan. And I encouraged them to expand, which they did. And they took a second loan and also paid it. Right now they are still operating, but they have not come to me for any additional assistance yet. Senghore	Maybe they are independent now? Sanyang	I hope so. This is our objective. Whoever we help, we want to see you stand on your two legs as time goes on. Senghore	Now on a final note, Mr Sanyang, what lessons can one learn from the IBAS experience, if you were to transpose the IBAS experience into other Third World countries. What lessons can be learned from you? Sanyang	It is a very useful lesson. You are moulding minds of the indigenous people who will become business people tomorrow. Who will become tax payers and employers of youth and other income generating for the economy. So it is very effective. Senghore	Thank you very much Mr Manka Sanyang, it has been a pleasure talking to you and thank you very much for your time. Sanyang	You are welcome.
