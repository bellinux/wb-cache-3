25|$|There is {{uncertainty}} {{regarding the}} gender gap {{between males and females}} with AS. A person with Asperger's is often remarked as possessing masculine traits like emotional distance from the inability to empathize, and far more boys than girls are diagnosed with Asperger's. Most studies on the syndrome were derived from research on males, neglecting specific attention to females with AS who often go misdiagnosed. For the most part, studies <b>on</b> <b>girls</b> with Asperger's are anecdotal.|$|E
25|$|Female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM) is common, particularly in rural areas, and is performed <b>on</b> <b>girls</b> {{between the ages}} of six months to six years. According to domestic NGOs, approximately 95 percent of adult women have undergone FGM. The practice is widespread in most regions and among most ethnic groups, was not subject to class boundaries, and is not religiously based. There are no laws against FGM, but a government decree prohibits FGM in government-funded health centres.|$|E

25|$|Major famines {{occurred}} in India every {{five to eight}} years in the 19th- and early 20th-centuries, resulting in millions starving to death. As also happened in China, these events begat infanticide: desperate starving parents would either kill a suffering infant, sell a child to buy food {{for the rest of the}} family, or beg people to take them away for nothing and feed them. Gupta and Shuzhou state that massive famines and poverty-related historical events had influenced historical sex ratios, and they have had deep cultural ramifications <b>on</b> <b>girls</b> and regional attitudes towards female infant mortality.|$|E
25|$|Adolescent {{girls and}} boys who are {{attracted}} to others {{of the same sex}} are strongly affected by their surroundings in that adolescents often decide to express their sexualities or keep them secret depending on certain factors in their societies. These factors affect {{girls and boys}} differently. If girls’ schools and religions are against same sex attractions, they pose the greatest obstacles to girls who experience same sex attractions. These factors were not listed as affecting boys as much. The researchers suggest that maybe this is because not only are some religions against same-sex attraction, but they also encourage traditional roles for women and do not believe that women can carry out these roles as lesbians. Schools may affect girls more than boys because strong emphasis is placed <b>on</b> <b>girls</b> to date boys, and many school activities place high importance on heterosexuality (such as cheerleading). Additionally, the idea of not conforming to typical male gender roles inhibited many boys from openly expressing their same-sex attraction. The worry of conforming to gender roles didn’t inhibit girls from expressing their same-gender preferences as much, because society is generally more flexible about their gender expression.|$|E
500|$|Female genital {{mutilation}} {{is carried out}} in several countries, especially in Africa, with 85 percent of {{genital mutilation}}s performed in Africa consisting of clitoridectomy or excision, {{and to a lesser}} extent in other parts of the Middle East and Southeast Asia, <b>on</b> <b>girls</b> from a few days old to mid-adolescent, often to reduce sexual desire in an effort to preserve vaginal virginity. In the United States, it is sometimes practiced <b>on</b> <b>girls</b> born with a clitoris that is larger than usual. Comfort Momoh, who specializes in the topic of FGM, states that FGM might have been [...] "practiced in ancient Egypt as a sign of distinction among the aristocracy"; there are reports that traces of infibulation are on Egyptian mummies. FGM is still routinely practiced in Egypt. Greenberg et al. report that [...] "one study found that 97% of married women in Egypt had had some form of genital mutilation performed." [...] Amnesty International estimated in 1997 that more than two million FGM procedures are performed every year.|$|E

'Cause I got {{something}} to say about it, And it goes something like this." [...] Handclaps and drum beats start as Madonna moves into the chorus of the song, with a thick vocal texture and high-pitched background singing. The chorus is aided by instrumentation from a saxophone and percussion. Madonna then sings the first verse of the song, as a violin sound is added after she finishes the bridge, [...] "Make you feel like a queen on the throne, make you love it till you never come down", a male voice repeating the last line.

500|$|The video {{opens with}} the view of a city {{populated}} with skyscrapers, intermingling railway lines and aero-crafts. Steam blows out of the funnels of a factory as big machines are shown. Madonna, wearing black lingerie, appears {{on the back of}} a statue of an angry looking swan, and utters the line: [...] "Come <b>on</b> <b>girls,</b> do you believe in love?" [...] This is followed by the chorus, showing the interiors of the factory where the workers slave at the machines, as rain pour incessantly on them. Amidst the smoke filled environment, the chiseled torso of the male workers are shown, as they strip off their shirts, with water splashing all around. Madonna is then shown in a light-green gown, holding a black cat in her lap, looking across the factory from her sitting room of her penthouse office. As she sings the first verse, the workers perform choreographed dance routine inside the factory. Madonna lies down on a sofa and the cat escapes from her lap, as her singing reaches the owner of the factory, through a series of speakers. He becomes nervous hearing her voice and looks down to find one of the workers staring up and looking for the source of the voice.|$|E
500|$|Professor Maury Dean {{wrote in}} his book Rock 'n' Roll Gold Rush: A Singles Un-Cyclopedia, that the main appeal of [...] "Express Yourself" [...] lay in its teen appeal, {{although}} he understood that at its core, it was addressing {{a very important issue}} of female liberation. Kevin Phinney from Austin American-Statesman commented that with [...] "Express Yourself", Madonna struck out her [...] "Material Girl" [...] persona, there by demonstrating once more that no image of hers is concrete. Based on the lyrics of the song, Ken Blakely of Philadelphia Daily News declared the song as a rare example of good taste and good advice from Like a Prayer. Andy Goldberg from The Jerusalem Post was impressed with Madonna's vocals on the song, complimenting the soul inlfluences. Rolling Stones J. D. Considine called [...] "Express Yourself" [...] an unabashed groove tune and felt that it seemed [...] "smart and sassy, right down to Madonna's soul-style testimony on the intro: 'Come <b>on,</b> <b>girls,</b> do you believe in love?" [...] Don McCleese from Chicago Sun-Times declared the song as {{one of the highlights of}} the album, feeling that it would become anthemic. Sal Cinquemani from Slant magazine, while reviewing Like a Prayer, announced [...] "Express Yourself" [...] as the most soulful performance of Madonna's career. He added that the song [...] "turned Madonna's 'Material Girl' image on its head, denouncing material things for a little r-e-s-p-e-c-t." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic felt that the song consisted of [...] "deep funk" [...] music.|$|E
