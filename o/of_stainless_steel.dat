40|$|AbstractCorrosion fatigue {{strength}} <b>of</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> {{is controlled by}} tangled interaction among environmental, mechanical and metallurgical factors. In order to estimate corrosion {{fatigue strength}} it is indispensable to understand {{the role of an}} each influencing factor. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present briefly surveyed results on metallurgical factors on corrosion fatigue strength <b>of</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> such as austenitic, martensitic and duplex <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> mainly based upon author’s experimental results. The targeted dominant metallurgical factors focussed upon are chemical compositions, heat treatment, manufacturing process and microstructures. The emphasis is placed upon effect of Molybdenum content on corrosion fatigue strength <b>of</b> austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> in 3 %NaCl aqueous solution, tempering temperature on corrosion fatigue strength of 13 % Chromium <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> in 3 %NaCl aqueous solution and volume percent ferrite on corrosion fatigue strength <b>of</b> duplex <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> in potassium alum aqueous solution. The surface and fracture surface observation by optical and scanning electron microscopy revealed that corrosion pit formed at corrosion fatigue crack initiation area. In light of relatively smaller effect of corrosive environment on corrosion fatigue crack propagation rate it can be surmised that corrosion fatigue strength <b>of</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> is governed by crack initiation process. It can be concluded that corrosion fatigue strength <b>of</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> is strongly influenced by metallurgical factors such as chemical compositions, heat treatment, manufacturing process and microstructures. The information obtained in this survey directly lead to prevention of corrosion fatigue failure in <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> made components, selection <b>of</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> in corrosive environments and development <b>of</b> corrosion resistant <b>stainless</b> <b>steels...</b>|$|R

30|$|<b>Stainless</b> <b>steels</b> are {{generally}} regarded {{to be more}} difficult to machine than carbon or low alloy <b>steels</b> [4, 5]. <b>Stainless</b> <b>steels</b> exhibit high ultimate elongation and work hardening [6]. When machining <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> with cemented carbide tools, the physical and mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> have great influences on the machining process, in which the heat-conducting property and cutting temperature are the crucial factors [7, 8]. Machining <b>of</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> is a very complex process with physical interactions involving cutting temperature, cutting force, plastic deformation, friction, high strain rate, and tool wear or failure [9]. Due to high plasticity <b>of</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> at high cutting temperature, high cutting force and high temperature is generated in machining <b>stainless</b> <b>steels,</b> which produces a situation for adhesion of the workpiece material to the tool and will shorten the tool life [10, 11]. Adhesion occurs under high cutting temperature and high compressive stress. Low thermal conduction rate and high ductility <b>of</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> can lead to the serious built-up edge (BUE) phenomenon in the machining process [12]. High affinity <b>of</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> to tools promotes adhesion to the cutting edge during high-speed machining conditions [13, 14]. Cold weld of workpiece material and tool is formed when cut-out due to relative low environmental temperature [15]. A consequence of the strong bonding between the tool and the material is the formation of different types of transfer and adherent layers during the machining process [16, 17]. Adhesion and tearing alternately occur with the machining process, and severe adhesive wear will appear before the tool reaches its normal wear life [18, 19].|$|R
