5|$|A {{knee injury}} would limit Comminges to just two {{appearances}} during the 2009–10 season, missing {{nine months of}} first-team action as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injury.</b> He had suffered the injury during training at the club after teammate Jay Bothroyd fell awkwardly onto Comminges, causing his knee ligament to detach. Comminges originally attempted to continue training but was ordered not to by manager Dave Jones {{on the advice of}} club doctors, who later discovered the severity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injury.</b> Comminges' contract was initially due to expire {{at the end of the}} season but, having suffered the injury, he was offered a six-month extension by the club until January 2011 in order to regain fitness and improve his chances of finding a new club. His appearance as a 90th-minute substitute in a 3–1 away victory at Plymouth Argyle on 18 August 2009 would ultimately be his last for the club.|$|E

5|$|TBI {{is usually}} {{classified}} based on severity, anatomical features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injury,</b> and the mechanism (the causative forces). Mechanism-related classification divides TBI into closed and penetrating head injury. A closed (also called nonpenetrating, or blunt) injury {{occurs when the}} brain is not exposed. A penetrating, or open, head injury occurs when an object pierces the skull and breaches the dura mater, the outermost membrane surrounding the brain.|$|E

5|$|Most {{people with}} TBI who die do so within minutes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injury,</b> due to {{complications}} such as pneumothorax and insufficient airway {{and to other}} injuries that occurred at the same time.

Years can pass before the condition is recognized. Some TBI are so small {{that they do not have}} significant clinical manifestations; they may never be noticed or diagnosed and may heal without intervention.|$|E

5|$|The {{severity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injury</b> is {{an important}} aspect in determining how much sexual function returns as a person recovers. According to the American Spinal Injury Association grading scale, an incomplete SCI {{is one in which}} some amount of sensation or motor function is preserved in the rectum. This indicates that the brain can still send and receive some messages to the lowest parts of the spinal cord, beyond the damaged area. In people with incomplete injury, {{some or all of the}} spinal tracts involved in sexual responses remain intact, allowing, for example, orgasms like those of uninjured people. In men, having an incomplete injury improves chances of being able to achieve erections and orgasms over those with complete injuries.|$|E
5|$|A month {{into the}} 2006–07 season, Higgins {{suffered}} a sprained left ankle {{during a game}} against the New Jersey Devils. At the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injury,</b> on November 4, 2006, he was leading the Canadiens with eight goals. Sidelined for 6 weeks, Higgins was limited to 61 games, though still managed to match his previous season's points total with 22 goals and 16 assists. Set to become a restricted free agent in the off-season, Montreal re-signed Higgins to a two-year, US$3.4 million deal on June 25, 2007. Prior {{to the start of the}} 2007–08 season, Higgins was named an alternate captain for the Canadiens. He went on to have a career season with personal bests of 27 goals, 25 assists and 52 points. On November 11, 2008, Higgins recorded his first NHL hat-trick in a 4–0 win over the Ottawa Senators. However, his points total decreased in his fourth NHL campaign with 23 points over 57 games.|$|E
5|$|A month {{into the}} 2008–09 season, Luongo began a shutout streak that lasted three {{games against the}} Nashville Predators, Phoenix Coyotes, and the Minnesota Wild, akin to the feat he {{accomplished}} in the same month of November the previous year. His overall shutout streak was snapped at 242:36 minutes, in a 2–1 shootout loss against the Colorado Avalanche, surpassing the Canucks record he set the previous season. Later that month, on November 22, Luongo left a game versus the Pittsburgh Penguins after suffering an adductor strain in his groin. Initially listed as week-to-week, he attempted what was considered an early comeback within two weeks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injury,</b> but suffered a setback during a team practice on December 10, leaving early in discomfort. After missing 24 games, Luongo made his return on January 15, 2009, in a 4–1 loss to the Phoenix Coyotes. While injured, Luongo was chosen {{for the fourth time}} to the NHL All-Star Game in 2009 as the lone Canucks representative. Despite speculation he would have to miss his second straight All-Star Game, Luongo recovered in time and took part in a 12–11 shootout loss to the Eastern Conference. He finished the season with back-to-back shutouts in the final two games against the Los Angeles Kings and Colorado Avalanche to establish a new career-high of nine shutouts on the season, breaking Dan Cloutier's previous franchise single-season shutout record of seven, set in 2001–02.|$|E

5|$|A person's {{experience}} in managing sexuality after the injury relies {{not only on}} physical factors like severity and level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injury,</b> but on aspects of life circumstances and personality such as sexual experience and attitudes about sex. As well as evaluating physical concerns, clinicians {{must take into account}} factors that affect each patient's situation: gender, age, cultural, and social factors. Aspects of patients' cultural and religious backgrounds, even if unnoticed before the injury caused sexual dysfunction, affect care and treatments—particularly when cultural attitudes and assumptions of patients and care providers conflict. Health professionals must be sensitive to issues of sexual orientation and gender identity, showing respect and acceptance while communicating, listening, and emotionally supporting. Providers who treat SCI have been found to assume their patients are heterosexual or to exclude LGBTQ patients from their awareness, potentially resulting in substandard care. Academic research on sexuality and disability under-represents LGBTQ perspectives as well.|$|E

Two months later, during a game against the Oklahoma City Barons on December 10, Schroeder was involved in a collision of several players and left the game with a high ankle sprain. Fourth on the team in scoring at the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injury,</b> with five goals and eight assists, Schroeder missed 16 games and returned to the Moose on January 20, 2011 against the Abbotsford Heat. He finished his professional rookie season with 28 points (10 goals and 18 assists) over 61 games, while adding 6 points (1 goal and 5 assists) in 11 post-season games.|$|E
5|$|After the 1992 season, Tolliver was a {{restricted}} free agent. Wilson {{signed a contract}} with the Saints, and to replace him the Falcons signed Bobby Hebert. Tolliver signed a one-year contract in August, after holding out for a time. Tolliver started the 1993 season as the third-string quarterback behind Hebert and Miller. However, Miller re-injured his left knee in late September, making Tolliver the main backup to Hebert. Tolliver made his first start against the Los Angeles Rams, but was injured in his second start against the Saints; the Falcons signed Chris Hakel as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injury.</b> Tolliver finished the season in occasional relief for Hebert, who remained bothered by injuries. Over the course of the year, Tolliver played in seven games and threw for just under 500 yards, and became a free agent after the season ended.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To provide data on <b>the</b> {{magnitude}} <b>of</b> animal-related farm {{injuries to}} {{youth in the}} United States. Data Source: A youth farm injury survey of 26, 000 farm households conducted for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 1998. Subjects: Youth less than 20 years of age. Results: There were an estimated 6438 animal-related farm injuries to youth less than 20 years in 1998 (injury rate = 1. 7 / 100 farms). Seventy percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injuries</b> occurred to youth farm residents. Sixty-nine percent of animal-related farm injuries were work related. Males accounted for 64 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animal-related farm <b>injuries.</b> Approximately 41 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injuries</b> occurred to youth under <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> 10. Thirty-seven percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injuries</b> involved horses, and 31 % involved cattle. <b>The</b> remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cases either involved some other animal or the animal was not specified. While <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> horse-related <b>injuries</b> occurred to females, <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cattle-related <b>injuries</b> were to males. Conclusions: Results from this study show {{that one out of}} every five youth farm <b>injuries</b> in <b>the</b> U. S. is animal-related. These animal-related injuries were due to both work and nonwork-related exposures, although a higher proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>injuries</b> were work-related. Because youth farm residents accounted for <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> farm animal-related <b>injuries,</b> they should be <b>the</b> focus <b>of</b> any intervention strategies. Further research is needed to better understand existing risk factors for animal-related injuries to youth on farms. ...|$|R
