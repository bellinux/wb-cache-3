These <b>external</b> <b>services</b> provides the user with a different medium then the game itself, and they therefore work as a complement to the game. This study examines if the use of <b>external</b> <b>services</b> for games is related to lack of information/functions in the game. The study focuses on the case of the recent mobile game Pokémon GO and the external environment surrounding the game. As an example the study focused on the game Pokémon GO and did a case study about this game to try the thesis. ...|$|R

The workflow concept {{has been very}} successful in streamlining business processes by automating the coordination of activities, but {{has so far been}} limited to the use within single organizations. To address the problems of cross-organizational workflows we use a service-oriented workflow model. Within this approach, we present a technique how to derive a model of the <b>external</b> <b>services,</b> based on continuous-time Markov chains, by analyzing their externally observable behavior. This allows to assess the quality of <b>external</b> <b>services,</b> without compromising the autonomy of the service providers...|$|R

40|$|A workflow-based {{web service}} may use ultra-late binding to invoke <b>external</b> web <b>services</b> to {{concretize}} its implementation at run time. Nonetheless, such <b>external</b> <b>services</b> or {{the availability of}} recently used <b>external</b> <b>services</b> may evolve without prior notification, dynamically triggering the workflow-based service to bind to new replacement <b>external</b> <b>services</b> to continue the current execution. Any integration mismatch may cause a failure. In this paper, we propose Preemptive Regression Testing (PRT), a novel testing approach that addresses this adaptive issue. Whenever such a late-change on the service under regression test is detected, PRT preempts the currently executed regression test suite, searches for additional test cases as fixes, runs these fixes, and then resumes {{the execution of the}} regression test suite from the preemption point. © 2012 IEEE |postprin...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{complexities}} of how <b>external</b> <b>service</b> provider employees culturally fit within client workplaces.

A combination of semi-structured interviews and focus groups are the qualitative methods used to collect the data. Findings The major findings of this study are that organisational socialisation can be successful in socialising <b>external</b> <b>service</b> provider staff into the client workplace despite a current lack of awareness of its use. This study has developed a framework that can be used to achieve this integration if client organisations and service providers work together to socialise <b>external</b> <b>service</b> provider staff.
