25|$|Empathy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of humanistic therapy. This idea focuses on the therapist’s ability to see the world through the eyes of the client. Without this, therapists can be forced to apply an external frame of reference where the therapist is no longer understanding the actions and thoughts of the client as the client would, but strictly as a therapist which defeats the purpose of humanistic therapy. Included in empathizing, unconditional positive regard {{is one of the}} key elements of humanistic psychology. Unconditional positive regard refers to the care that the therapist needs to have for the client. This ensures that the therapist does not become the authority figure in the relationship allowing for a more <b>open</b> <b>flow</b> of information as well as a kinder relationship between the two. A therapist practicing humanistic therapy needs to show a willingness to listen and ensure the comfort of the patient where genuine feelings may be shared but are not forced upon someone. Marshall Rosenberg, one of Carl Rogers' students, emphasizes empathy in the relationship in his concept of Nonviolent Communication.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the transition to}} chaos in the motion of particles advected by <b>open</b> <b>flows</b> with obstacles. By means of a topological argument, we show that the separation points {{on the surface of}} the obstacle imply the existence of a saddle point downstream from the obstacle, with an associated heteroclinic orbit. We argue that as soon as the flow becomes time periodic, these orbits give rise to heteroclinic tangles, causing passively advected particles to experience transient chaos. The transition to chaos thus coincides with the onset of time dependence in <b>open</b> <b>flows</b> with stagnant points, in contrast with flows with no stagnant points. We also show that the nonhyperbolic nature of the dynamics near the walls causes anomalous scalings in the vicinity of the transition.

This is true for any value of the mesh spacing. From the convective/absolute instability analysis of the numerical dispersion relation, one may deduce conditions on the discretization parameters in order to avoid erroneous global results such as a stable numerically computed spectrum in a physically unstable situation, or vice versa. 1 INTRODUCTION Many <b>open</b> <b>flows,</b> such as wakes, hot jets, mixing layers, the Raleigh-B'enard and Taylor-Couette flows with throughflow, become unstable a [...] ...|$|R

According to Betz's law, no turbine can capture more than 16/27 (59.3%) of the kinetic energy in wind. The factor 16/27 (0.593) is known as Betz's coefficient. Practical utility-scale wind turbines achieve at peak 75% to 80% of the Betz limit.|$|E
