5|$|On 16 September 2005, Danish {{news service}} Ritzau {{published}} an article discussing the difficulty encountered by the writer Kåre Bluitgen, who was initially unable to find an illustrator prepared {{to work on his}} children's book The Qur'an and the life of the Prophet Muhammad (Danish:Koranen og profeten Muhammeds liv). Three artists declined Bluitgen's proposal <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> reprisals.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} {{eventually}} canceled by the Air Force in January 1959, seemingly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> a negative public reaction {{and the risk}} to the population should anything have gone wrong with the launch. Another factor, cited by project leader Leonard Reiffel, was the possible implications of the nuclear fallout for future lunar research projects and colonization.|$|E
5|$|A general {{mobilisation}} was {{not called}} until 3 April 1941, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> offending Adolf Hitler. By {{the time the}} invasion commenced, the 1st Cavalry Division had only begun mobilisation. According to the Yugoslav historian Velimir Terzić, on 6 April the mobilisation of the division was proceeding slowly due to the low number of conscripts that reported for duty, and the poor provision of animals and vehicles. A {{large portion of the}} strength of the division had been earmarked to be detached to one of the formations of the 4th Army, Detachment Ormozki.|$|E
50|$|On March 8, 2010, Olmsted, as Bishop of Phoenix, {{joined in}} signing a letter {{with two other}} bishops of Arizona in expressing concern over Arizona SB 1070 {{indicating}} that if passed it might instill fear in those illegal immigrants who are victims of crime and deter them from going to the police <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> deportation.|$|R
25|$|The {{day before}} the {{election}}, Afghan election officials ordered more than 440 polling stations to stay closed during the vote <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> election fraud. The Independent Election Commission (IEC) said Hamid Karzai's supporters were trying to keep open polling stations deep within insurgent-held regions where the army and police fear going and where voting could not be properly monitored by observers.|$|R

5|$|In his 2005 and 2006 {{biographies of}} Druitt, D. J. Leighton {{concluded}} that Druitt was innocent, but repeated some of Knight's and Wilding's discredited claims. Leighton suggested that Druitt {{could have been}} murdered, either out of greed by his elder brother William or, as previously suggested by Howells and Skinner, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> exposure by Harry Wilson's homosexual cronies. The propensity of theorists to associate Ripper suspects with homosexuality has led scholars to assume that such notions are based on homophobia rather than evidence.|$|E
5|$|The {{supposed}} refusals {{from these}} first three artists to participate {{was seen as}} evidence of self-censorship <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> violence from Islamists, which led to much debate in Denmark. The Danish news paper Politiken stated at February 12, 2006, that they asked Bluitgen {{to put them in}} touch with the artists, so the claim that none of them dared to work with him could be proved. The author refused, and nobody has ever been able to confirm whether the incident is properly described.|$|E
5|$|Tianshun {{proved to}} be a troubled time and Mongol forces within the Ming {{military}} structure continued to be problematic. On 7 August 1461, the Chinese general Cao Qin and his Ming troops of Mongol descent staged a coup against the Tianshun Emperor <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> being next on his purge-list of those who aided him in the Wresting the Gate Incident. Cao's rebel force managed to set fire to the western and eastern gates of the Imperial City (doused by rain during the battle) and killed several leading ministers before his forces were finally cornered and he was forced to commit suicide.|$|E

50|$|The {{delay in}} the release {{of some of the}} detainees was due to {{considerations}} of their safety. Some could not be returned to their home countries, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> retaliation from their fellow citizens, or from the governments of their countries. Some, like Al Laithi, were returned to their home countries after the US secured a promise {{that they would not be}} punished by their home countries. Others, like five of the Uyghur detainees in Guantanamo, were released when the US found a third country which would accept them.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the origin}} of the company name is no longer known, several {{theories}} are known to exist. Most commonly, in the early 1930s, A.L. Luce was perceived to have been nervous about using the family surname for the company <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> it being mispronounced (i.e., [...] "the loose bus"). [...] When showing a blue and yellow demonstrator unit to school officials, Luce overheard the positive reception of school children who had seen the bus, who had nicknamed it [...] "a pretty blue bird"; Luce chose that name for his body manufacturing company, though school buses are painted yellow today.|$|R
5|$|Turner met Johnny Stompanato {{during the}} spring of 1957, shortly after ending her {{marriage}} to Barker. After she discovered his ties to the Los Angeles underworld (in particular, his association with gangster Mickey Cohen), she tried to break off the affair <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> bad publicity. Stompanato was not easily deterred, however, and {{over the course of the}} following year, they carried on a relationship filled with violent arguments, physical abuse, and repeated reconciliations.|$|E
5|$|After unrelenting {{political}} pressure from Adolf Hitler, Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941. On 27 March, {{a military coup}} d'état overthrew the government that had signed the pact, and a new government was formed under {{the commander of the}} VVKJ, Armijski đeneral Dušan Simović. A general mobilisation was not initiated by the new government until 3 April 1941, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> offending Hitler and thus precipitating war. However, on the same day as the coup, Hitler issued Führer Directive 25 which called for Yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state, and on 3 April, Führer Directive 26 was issued, detailing the plan of attack and command structure for the German-led Axis invasion.|$|E

5000|$|Devotees of Kurtzman's version {{found the}} {{magazine}} to have deteriorated after his departure. To others it lost its edge—it avoided satirizing targets such as segregation <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> hurting circulation. This reluctance {{was the target}} of a parody of the magazine in Esquire, prefaced with: [...] "Just {{imagine what it would be}} like if you picked up your monthly copy of [...] and found us dealing with subjects of genuine significance in America!" [...] The restriction on mature themes drove Paul Krassner to leave Mad to found The Realist in 1958 as an adult-oriented alternative to Mad.|$|R
5|$|Two {{additional}} {{ships were}} laid down four years later. Roma {{was built by}} the CRDA shipyard, starting on 18 September 1938. She was launched on 9 June 1940 and was completed on 14 June 1942, after which she joined the fleet in La Spezia and replaced Littorio as the fleet flagship. Impero was laid down at the Ansaldo shipyard on 14 May 1938. She was launched on 15 November 1939, but she was never completed. After the entrance of Italy to World War II, the Italian Navy moved the unfinished ship from Genoa to Brindisi, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> French attacks on the vessel.

5|$|As in most Mario series games, {{the main}} protagonist is Mario, whose initial {{goal is to}} rescue Princess Peach (Toadstool) from Bowser. However, the story takes on an unusual and very {{important}} twist. Soon {{after the start of}} his journey, the Smithy Gang invades the world. While attempting to stop the group, Mario is joined by Mallow, a cloud boy who thinks he is a tadpole; Geno, a doll possessed by a celestial spirit from the Star Road; Bowser, whose armies have deserted him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> the Smithy Gang; and Princess Toadstool, who was lost in the turmoil that occurred when the Smithy Gang arrived. The Smithy Gang is led by Smithy, a robotic blacksmith from an alternate dimension with aspirations of world domination.|$|E
5|$|The Vidiians' culture also shifts as {{a result}} of the Phage. In Vidiian society, an {{individual}} would hire a specialist, or a honatta, to find the required organs or tissues. Extended periods of contact or group meetings are strongly discouraged to prevent the further spread of the Phage, and those infected are shunned by healthy Vidiians <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> contamination. The Vidiians also capture other species to work for them as slaves doing manual tasks, such as mining. In the years following Voyager encounters with the Vidiians but prior to their return to Earth, a committee of alien intellectuals known as the Think Tank claimed to have cured the Phage.|$|E
5|$|The {{agricultural}} sector continued to perform poorly and by Brezhnev's final year, food shortages were reaching disturbing levels of frequency. Particularly embarrassing {{to the regime}} {{was the fact that}} even bread had become rationed, one commodity that they always prided themselves on being available. One reason for this was excessive consumer demand as food prices remained artificially low while incomes had trebled over the last 20 years. Despite the miserable failure of collective farming, the Soviet government remained committed to reducing imports of foodstuffs from the West even though they cost less than domestic production, not only for reasons of national pride, but <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> becoming dependent on capitalist countries for basic necessities.|$|E

5|$|The {{first season}} {{introduces}} the six main characters: Shelly, J.T., Rita, Janie, Nick, and Donovan. Shelly runs the fashion boutique DivaStyle {{with her friends}} Janie and Rita. She pursues a relationship with J.T., only to discover he is afraid of commitment and exhibits some chauvinistic behavior. Their relationship is often tested by frequent misunderstandings. Nick wants to find his ideal partner, but his attempts are typically thwarted as he is very particular about women. Even though his relationship with a woman named Dani appears to be successful, they soon break up. Donovan finds himself romantically attracted to Rita, but he resists the temptation <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> ruining their friendship.|$|E
5|$|ZANU-PF won a {{landslide}} victory, with 61% {{of the presidential}} vote and over two-thirds of parliamentary seats. The elections were not considered free and fair; there were widespread stories of vote rigging and many voters may have been fearful of the violence that had surrounded the 2008 election. During the campaign, many MDC supporters had remained quiet about their views <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> reprisals. The MDC was also negatively impacted by its time in coalition government, with perceptions {{that it had been}} just as corrupt as ZANU-PF. ZANU-PF had also capitalised on its appeals to African race, land, and liberation, while the MDC was often associated with white farmers, Western nations, and perceived Western values such as LGBT rights.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1998, Ferraro left Crossfire {{and ran for the}} Democratic {{nomination}} again in the 1998 United States Senate election in New York. The other candidates were Congressman Charles Schumer and New York City Public Advocate Mark J. Green. She had done no fundraising, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> conflict of interest with her Crossfire job, but was nonetheless immediately perceived as the front-runner. Indeed, December and January polls had her 25percentage points ahead of Green in the race and even further ahead of Schumer. Unlike the previous campaigns, her family finances never became an issue. However, she lost ground during the summer, with Schumer catching up in the polls by early August and then soon passing her. Schumer, a tireless fundraiser, outspent her by a five-to-one margin, and Ferraro failed to establish a political image current with the times. In the , 1998 primary, she was beaten soundly by Schumer by a 51percent to 26percent margin. Unlike 1992, the contest was not divisive, and Ferraro and third-place finisher Green endorsed Schumer at a unity breakfast the following day. Schumer would go on to decisively unseat D'Amato in the general election.|$|E
50|$|Count Berchtold's {{focus on}} Serbia was grown <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> Serbian {{territorial}} {{expansion in the}} Balkans and also a complication of frictional matters within the multinational Dual Monarchy, and would eventually result in {{the dissolution of the}} empire itself.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the European continent, in nations where {{abortion}} is legal, many requests for induced abortions, of otherwise normal pregnancies, were obtained <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> radiation from Chernobyl; including an excess {{number of abortions}} of healthy human fetuses in Denmark {{in the months following}} the accident. As the increase in radiation in Denmark was so low that almost no increased risk of birth defects was expected, the public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands [...] "caused" [...] more fetal deaths in Denmark than the accident.

5|$|Kane {{opened at}} the RKO Palace Theatre on Broadway in New York on May 1, 1941, in Chicago on May 6, and in Los Angeles on May 8. Welles said that at the Chicago premiere that he {{attended}} the theater was almost empty. It did well in cities and larger towns but fared poorly in more remote areas. RKO still had problems getting exhibitors to show the film. For example, one chain controlling more than 500 theaters got Welles's film {{as part of a}} package but refused to play it, reportedly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> Hearst. Hearst's disruption of the film's release damaged its box office performance and, as a result, it lost $160,000 during its initial run. The film earned $23,878 during its first week in New York. By the ninth week it only made $7,279. Overall it lost money in New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., but made a profit in Seattle.|$|E
5|$|News of the {{encounter}} was conveyed back to France, but the country was {{at this time in}} one of the most turbulent eras of the ongoing Revolution and little notice was taken of events in India. Historian William James notes that under normal political circumstances the action would have had more significant ramifications, while Edward Pelham Brenton claims that the French deliberately ignored the report <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> antagonising Britain. In Britain, the Admiralty approved of Cornwallis' actions, suggesting that the French were deliberately using the guise of trade to support Mysore against Britain. The action had no effect on the ongoing war in India, which was now centred on the inland city of Seringapatam. As British forces closed on the city in February 1792, the Tipu Sultan initiated peace talks which brought the war to an end in exchange for concessions to the Company and its Indian allies.|$|E
5|$|The backstory {{presented}} in StarCrafts manual {{and in the}} novel Shadow Hunters also shows {{the rise of a}} second society of Protoss known as the Nerazim. They are a sizeable minority of the Protoss who reject the Khala <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> losing their individuality inside the psychic link. The Nerazim are treated as heretics by the Khalai Protoss and are forcibly evicted from Aiur. Despite their persecution, the majority of Dark Templar do not hold anything against their estranged brethren, seeking to defend Aiur in any way they can. The Nerazim are presented as nomadic, liberal society, only settling on the planet Shakuras to study a Xel'Naga temple there. During the Brood War event, the Protoss lose their homeworld of Aiur to the Zerg (even with the Overmind being destroyed by Tassadar) and the Khalai Protoss are forced to escape and seek refuge on Shakuras, by then the homeworld of the Nerazim Protoss. After the conclusion of StarCraft, the two groups begin to reconcile, but the reconciliation is marred by mutual distrust.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, Odgen Corporation {{sold the}} track to Belle Isle Ltd., led by Buddy LeRoux. In 1987, LeRoux {{threatened}} to close Suffolk Downs unless the state granted financial {{concessions to the}} track. In January 1988, the state Legislature gave LeRoux the concessions he asked for, which allowed racing to continue through the 1989 season. LeRoux made it known that he would allow the track's license expire after the concessions expired, under the premise that racing was no longer profitable. The track closed after racing on December 30, 1989. Races were scheduled for the next day, however, track management canceled them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> vandalism. Between 1990 and 1991, there was no racing at Suffolk Downs.|$|R
