However, due to lobbying from groups like PourEva1 and increasing doubt about the system, new tests were done and more controls were added. The most important test is the introduction of <b>optical</b> <b>reading</b> of paper ballots in two areas. This test was scheduled for 3 elections up to 2003 and was not re-conducted. The test was successful and gave no problems, despite this being the first election to use it. <b>Optical</b> <b>reading</b> of eVoting is Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail and guarantees {{the possibility of a}} human recount. The extra control introduced is the creation of an expert committee to monitor the electronic election process.

40|$|A new servowriter {{positioning}} device for hard disk drives is presented. Existing servowriters usually use laser interferometry for position sensing. Therefore a servowriter is expensive, complicated and large in size. To avoid these problems we propose {{to use a}} laser incremental encoder with autofocus operation instead. In the device, an <b>optical</b> <b>read</b> head focuses three beams upon a grating scale. The middle beam is used to keep the read head in focus and two side ones to readout. The grating scale has two sets of the reflective grating displaced relative to each other by one eighth of the pitch width to give 90 ° out-of-phase signals. The <b>optical</b> <b>read</b> head can be the modification of CD or DVD pickup using the 3 -beam principle, and can be naturally designed into the system. Therefore, the cost {{and size of the}} servowriter are significantly reduced. At the same time, accuracy can be maintained using error-correcting grating scale. The {{positioning device}} can also be used as a track sensor to directly provide the track position signal of read/write (R/W) heads of HDA instead of conventional servo pattern...|$|R

We tested 220 consecutive Caucasian patients with autoimmune chronic thyroiditis, 104 patients with Graves' disease, 220 subjects {{from the general population}} (control I) and 78 healthy control subjects not affected by thyroid autoimmune disorders (control II) for the presence of anti-CD 38 autoimmunity. Using Western blot analysis and optical densitometry, a specific band corresponding to human recombinant CD 38 was identified in the serum of several subjects. By defining anti-CD 38 positivity as a standardized <b>optical</b> <b>reading</b> > 3 s. d. higher than the mean value of control I, 10. 4 % of patients with thyroiditis and 7. 7 % of Graves' patients were anti-CD 38 positive (P = 0. 0009 versus 1. 8 % of control I). Similarly, 13. 1 % of patients with thyroiditis and 10. 5 % of Graves' patients had a standardized <b>optical</b> <b>reading</b> > 3 s. d. higher than the mean value of the subjects not affected by thyroid autoimmune disorders (P = 0. 002 versus 1. 2 % of control II). Anti-CD 38 autoimmunity did not differ between euthyroid, hyperthyroid or hypothyroid patients or between patients with or without thyroid hypoechogenicity. Anti-CD 38 autoantibodies were associated with higher levels of circulating antithyroid-peroxidase antibodies (P = 0. 03) and they were more frequent in Graves' patients with ophthalmopathy (P < 0. 05).

When the adhesion index values obtained by bioluminescence measurement were used as reference, the total plate count technique appeared to be unreliable in estimating the number of bacteria adhering to the hydrocarbon phase.

The micro-cantilevers were functionalized with the composite 1, 4, 8, 11 -tetraazacyclotetradecane (cyclam), which is binding to cadaverine molecules in the gas phase. Different functionalization conditions were investigated by immersing gold coated AFM cantilevers in cyclam solutions at different concentrations, for different functionalization times, and for different post-annealing treatments. The optimum morphology for high capture efficiency is found for short functionalization times without post-annealing treatment.
