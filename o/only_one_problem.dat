As a result, the possibility of focusing on feedback loops {{has proven to be}} an important feature of the Encyclopedia, and a program has been carried out to identify [...] "vicious problem loops". A vicious problem loop is a chain of problems, each aggravating the next, and with the last looping back to aggravate the first in the chain. [...] Here is an example: Man-made disasters, Vulnerability of ecosystem niches, Natural environment degradation, Shortage of natural resources, Unbridled competition for scarce resources, Man-made disasters. Solutions that focus on <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>problem</b> in a chain may fail or even be harmful, because the cycle has the capacity to regenerate itself, and also because several cycles may interlock, forming tangled skeins of interlinked global problems. The loop detection program detected more than 50,000 loops (of up to 9 elements) in more than 12,000 problem profiles. It is thought that a similar work could be done about mutually facilitating or constraining strategy loops, so as to constitute a dynamic response to aggravating or reducing loops of problems through a circle of matching strategies.|$|E

Corro in reality lost his title by <b>only</b> <b>one</b> point, as Antuofermo beat him by a split decision, and each judge had a one-point difference on their scorecard (scores of 146-145, 145-146 and 142-143). Asked about the fight during the press conference that proceeded it, Corro answered [...] "I <b>only</b> had <b>one</b> <b>problem,</b> his head".

50|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of NGT {{is that the}} method lacks flexibility {{by being able to}} deal with <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>problem</b> at a time. Also, there must be a certain amount of conformity {{on the part of the}} members involved in NGT. Everyone must feel comfortable with the amount of structure involved. Another disadvantage is the amount of time needed to prepare for the activity. There is no spontaneity involved with this method. Facilities must be arranged and carefully planned. Opinions may not converge in the voting process, cross-fertilization of ideas may be constrained, and the process may appear to be too mechanical.|$|E
