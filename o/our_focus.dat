25|$|Easterly {{believes}} that aid goals should be small.

Rather than establish a utopian vision for a particular country, Easterly insists that we shift <b>our</b> <b>focus</b> to the most basic needs and improvements. If we feed, clothe, vaccinate, build infrastructure, and support markets, the macroscopic results will follow.|$|E

Then in Section 4, we explain the path string-based method for page classification. In Section 5, we introduce <b>our</b> profile-based <b>focused</b> crawling method. In Section 6, we discuss the cotagging topic discovery for the focused crawler. In Section 7, we wrap the previous sections to present <b>our</b> complete <b>focused</b> crawling system. In Section 8, we present our experimental results. Finally in Section 9, we make our conclusions and discuss future work.|$|R

500|$|Parlophone's {{advertising}} campaign was unorthodox. The label took full-page advertisements in high-profile British newspapers and tube stations with lyrics for [...] "Fitter Happier" [...] pitched in large black letters against white backgrounds. The same lyrics, and artwork {{adapted from the}} album, were repurposed for shirt designs. Yorke said, [...] "We actively chose to pursue the 'Fitter Happier' thing" [...] to link what a critic called [...] "a coherent set of concerns" [...] between the album artwork and its promotional material. More unconventional merchandise included a floppy disk with Radiohead screensavers and an FM radio {{in the shape of}} a desktop computer. In America, Capitol sent 1,000 cassette players to prominent members of the press and music industry, each with a copy of the album permanently glued inside. When asked about the campaign after the album's release, Capitol president Gary Gersh said, [...] "Our job is just to take them as a left-of-center band and bring the center to them.

500|$|The writers for {{the season}} worked in Los Angeles, with {{one member of the}} writing team on set in New York for filming. Actress Carrie-Anne Moss talked about how the scripts {{developed}} through the production of the season, explaining that the dialogue usually did not change much while filming, but scenes were altered to accommodate the filming locations when necessary. Rosenberg stated that, since Jones is a private investigator, there would be some procedural elements to the show, [...] "but that’s not <b>our</b> <b>focus.</b> There are cases. In particular, there is a large case that carries over the season." [...] Elaborating on this, Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb said that the [...] "fun about being a private detective is that the line between what’s legal and what’s not legal gets very blurred....her drive is not always necessarily to solve the case, {{as much as it is}} to go, 'Okay, can I pay the rent?

500|$|During the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Spurs {{started with}} a lackluster 6–8 record and Popovich came under fire from the press. However, Duncan and Robinson stood behind their coach, and {{finished}} {{the season with a}} 31–5 run. The sophomore averaged 21.7 points, 11.4 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 2.5 blocks in the regular season, making both the All-NBA and All-Defense First Teams. In the 1999 NBA Playoffs, the Spurs defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 3–1, swept the Los Angeles Lakers and the Portland Trail Blazers 4–0, and defeated the Cinderella story New York Knicks 4–1 in the Finals. In this series, a large contingent of Virgin Islanders flew over to support their local hero, and were not disappointed. In the first two games, the [...] "Twin Towers" [...] outscored their Knicks counterparts Chris Dudley/Larry Johnson with 41 points, 26 rebounds, and nine blocks versus five points, 12 rebounds, and zero blocks. After a Game 3 loss in which Duncan was held scoreless in the third quarter and committed three turnovers in the last quarter, Duncan bounced back with 28 points and 18 rebounds in a Game 4 win, and in Game 5, the Spurs protected a 78–77 lead seconds from the end with the ball in the Knicks' possession. Double teamed by Duncan and Robinson, Knicks swingman Latrell Sprewell missed a last-second desperation shot, and after closing out the series with a strong 31-point and 9-rebound showing in Game 5, Duncan was named Finals MVP, bringing San Antonio their first-ever NBA championship. The accolades for the Spurs soon arrived, with Sports Illustrated reporting that the San Antonio [...] "monkey has been shed", and that the Spurs were no longer known as the [...] "San Antonio softies". The magazine praised Finals MVP Duncan, who was later quoted: [...] "This is incredible. We kept <b>our</b> <b>focus</b> and we pulled it out." [...] Sports Illustrated journalist and retired NBA player Alex English added: [...] "Duncan came up big each time they went to him with that sweet turnaround jumper off the glass. He was the man tonight [...]" [...] And Popovich later said to losing coach Jeff Van Gundy: [...] "I've got Tim [...] and you don't. That's the difference." ...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that a method of performing surveillance for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) is to screen specimens submitted for Clostridium difficile testing. We compared this approach to <b>our</b> <b>focused</b> surveillance program of high-risk units during October 1997 to compare the yield of VRE and multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MDRE) with both methods. Of the stools submitted for C. difficile testing, 14 % were positive for VRE or MDRE, whereas rectal swabs from routine surveillance yielded 11 % VRE- or MDRE-positive results. Although stools submitted for C. difficile testing resulted in a higher percentage of positive cultures, 14 VRE- and 2 MDRE-positive patients from our high-risk population were missed because many patients had no stool submitted for C. difficile testing. Therefore, while screening stools submitted for C. difficile testing cannot replace <b>our</b> <b>focused</b> surveillance program, it appears advantageous to assess these stools at various intervals to detect new patient reservoirs of drug-resistant organisms that may benefit from routine surveillance cultures...|$|R
