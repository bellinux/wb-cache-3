40|$|Underpinned by {{the rise}} in <b>online</b> <b>criminality,</b> the payment card {{industry}} (PCI) data security standards (DSS) were introduced which outlines {{a subset of the}} core principals and requirements that must be followed, including precautions relating to the software that processes credit card data. The necessity to implement these requirements in existing software applications can present software owners and developers with a range of issues. We present here a generic solution to the sensitive issue of PCI compliance where aspect orientated programming (AOP) can be applied to meet the requirement of masking the primary account number (PAN). Our architecture allows a definite amount of code to be added which intercepts all the methods specified in the aspect, regardless of future additions to the system thus reducing the amount of work required to the maintain aspect. We believe that the concepts here will provide an insight into how to approach the PCI requirements to undertake the task. The software artefact should also serve as a guide to developers attempting to implement new applications, where security and design are fundamental elements that should be considered through each phase of the software development lifecycle and not as an afterthought...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a content enabling system that provides deep semantic search and information access to {{large quantities of}} distributed multimedia data for both experts and the general public. It provides a language independent search and dynamic classification features for {{a broad range of}} data collected from several sources in a number of culturally diverse languages. This system is part of the Online Police Station, launched by the Italian Minister of the Interior in 2006. The Online Police Station uses a virtual reality interface to provide general information and online assistance. Citizens can download forms, make complaints, receive advice and/or report events of an illegal nature. Police specialists can monitor criminal trends to ensure that responses are appropriately focused, and that scarce resources are more effectively employed against <b>criminality.</b> <b>Online</b> Police Station was voted as the Most inspiring good practice for creative solutions to common challenges, during the last European eGovernment Awards 2007...|$|R
