5|$|The four {{throwing}} events generally all {{begin on}} one side of the stadium. The javelin throw typically takes place on a piece of track that is central and parallel to the straights of the main running track. The javelin throwing area is a sector shape frequently across the Pitch (sports field) in the middle of the stadium, ensuring that the javelin has a minimal chance of causing damage or injury. The discus throw and hammer throw contests begin in a tall metal cage usually situated in one of the corners of the field. The cage reduces the danger of implements being thrown <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> of play and throws travel diagonally across the field in the centre of the stadium. The shot put features a circular throwing area with a toe board at one end. The throwing area is a sector. Some stadia also have a water jump area {{on one side}} of the field specifically for steeplechase races.|$|E
5|$|Back at UNITY's headquarters, Cate is congratulated for {{a mission}} well done, and {{everybody}} leaves to grab some rest. Cate {{arrives at a}} graveyard where Bruno was buried to pay her respects. She is then confronted by the supposedly long-dead Tom Goodman, who reveals {{that he is the}} real traitor within UNITY, and a final gun duel ensues. Cate manages to injure Tom and arrest him, but Smith shoots Tom, causing him to fall into a freshly dug grave. Smith then tries to shoot Cate as well, but Jones shoots Smith and reveals that Bruno is still alive. Smith attempts his one last effort to shoot Cate, but Cate kills Smith just in time. With Tom and Smith shot dead, Jones and Bruno decide to tell Cate the truth; Bruno falsified his death so that Cate and the rest of UNITY could find the real traitor. Seven years ago, Smith was taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> by UNITY due to his inadequate fieldwork. In order to sabotage UNITY as a way to avenge himself, Smith joins H.A.R.M. to kill the real Tom Goodman, and replace him with an impostor. When Cate's investigation initially foiled H.A.R.M.'s plan, both Smith and his mole were forced to reveal their true intentions. Cate reacts in shock upon finding out the truth.|$|E
5|$|During {{this second}} tour, Schwarzkopf noted two {{incidents}} which haunted him. On February 17, 1970, {{two men in}} C Company, 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry were killed by friendly fire from an American artillery shell that had been ordered by Schwarzkopf, but which had struck a tree near their position {{on its way to}} a target. The parents of one soldier blamed him for the death of their son, a claim which Schwarzkopf strongly denied and termed an accident of war. On May 28, 1970, Schwarzkopf landed his helicopter when discovering troops of B Company who had stumbled into a minefield. Two company officers had been wounded and two soldiers were trapped, fearful of setting off more mines. Although a medevac was on its way, Schwarzkopf ordered his UH-1 Huey to remove the wounded. As he attempted to help the troops back <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> one soldier struck a landmine, breaking a leg, and began to panic. Fearing he would set off another landmine, Schwarzkopf pinned the soldier to the ground while another soldier put a splint on the wounded man's leg. In doing so, another mine was set off, killing three and wounding Schwarzkopf's artillery officer.|$|E

25|$|In {{association}} football, linesmen carry small flags {{along the}} touch lines. They use the flags to indicate to the referee potential infringements of the laws, or who {{is entitled to}} possession of the ball that has gone <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> of play, or, most famously, raising the flag to indicate an offside offence. Officials called touch judges use flags for similar purposes in both codes of rugby.|$|E

25|$|Aside {{from field}} show and parade, {{competitions}} among secondary school {{can also have}} the march off (also concentration block or drill down). This event involves all participants on the field following the commands of a drill sergeant.

25|$|Cataract {{surgery was}} known to the {{physician}} Sushruta (6th century BCE). Traditional cataract surgery was performed with a special tool called the Jabamukhi Salaka, a curved needle used to loosen the lens and push the cataract <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> of vision. The eye would later be soaked with warm butter and then bandaged. Though this method was successful, Susruta cautioned that it should only be used when necessary. The removal of cataract by surgery was also introduced into China from India.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{thereafter}} {{the local}} sheriff and local residents {{arrived at the}} scene of the crash. The thrust from the still-idling jet engine allowed the aircraft to slowly drift on its belly along a field. The sheriff, having contacted the air base, was informed that he should simply allow the jet to run out of fuel, which occurred an hour and forty-five minutes later without further incident. A recovery crew from McClellan Air Force Base arrived on the scene and began to dismantle the aircraft, removing its wings for transport aboard a railroad flat car. The damage to the aircraft was minimal; indeed, one officer on the recovery crew is reported to have stated that if there were any less damage he would have simply flown the aircraft <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E

25|$|Much of the {{evidence}} entered against her was from events that had happened {{five or ten years}} previous. Phillip and Sarah Nelson testified that Robert Shilleto (by then deceased, so he could not affirm or deny the story) had repeatedly complained that Margaret was a witch, afflicting him until he died. Jonathan Burbank, Captain Daniel Wycomb and Frances Wycomb testified that Margaret had come to Burbank's house, asking for corn from his field. (By this time, she had long been widowed.) Burbank initially asked her to wait until he retrieved it from his field, but when she persisted, his wife gave her some. Later, when he went to get some more corn <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> his oxen refused to move, which he attributed to Margaret's bewitching of them. Similarly, Thomas Nelson testified that Margaret repeatedly came to him for wood, for payment of a debt he owed to her. After he denied her, two of his cows died, which he and his neighbors considered unnatural, causing him to conclude Margaret was a witch.|$|E
500|$|About 1860, Holmes {{invented the}} [...] "American stereoscope", a 19th-century {{entertainment}} in which pictures were viewed in 3-D.

50|$|In {{high school}} football, players are {{permitted}} to kick off special flat kicking tees up to two inches high. The NCAA banned <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> kicking tees in 1989. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> longer-range <b>field</b> goals in NCAA history were kicked prior to <b>the</b> elimination <b>of</b> tees; <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> tees allowed <b>the</b> ball to be elevated <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field's</b> grass or turf, reducing friction in <b>the</b> opening milliseconds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kick and allowing for longer kicks.|$|R

2500|$|... "Is God Dead?" [...] was an April 8, 1966, {{cover story}} for the news {{magazine}} Time. A previous article, from October 1965, had investigated a trend among 1960s theologians to write God <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> of theology. The 1966 article looked in greater depth at the problems facing modern theologians, in making God relevant to an increasingly secular society. Modern science had eliminated the need for religion to explain the natural world, and God took up less and less space in people's daily lives. The ideas of various scholars were brought in, including the application of contemporary philosophy {{to the field of}} theology, and a more personal, individual approach to religion.|$|E
2500|$|Jelinek {{had begun}} to develop an {{interest}} in linguistics after the immigration of his wife, who initially enrolled in the MIT linguistics program {{with the help of}} Roman Jakobson.

2500|$|Commercial {{activity}} {{to bring an}} IL-2 drug to market was intense in the 1980s and '90s. By 1983, Cetus Corporation had created a proprietary recombinant version of IL-2 (Aldesleukin, later branded as Proleukin), with the alanine removed from its N-terminal and residue 125 replaced with serine. Amgen later entered the field with its own proprietary, mutated, recombinant protein and Cetus and Amgen were soon competing scientifically and in the courts; Cetus won the legal battles and forced Amgen <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> [...] By 1990 Cetus had gotten aldesleukin approved in nine European countries but in that year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refused to approve Cetus' application to market IL-2.

Chiron continued the development of IL-2, which was finally approved by the FDA as Proleukin for metastatic renal carcinoma in 1992.|$|E
2500|$|A typical {{passage of}} rugby union takes the {{following}} form. [...] Unlike rugby league and gridiron football, {{possession of the}} ball in rugby union is contestable at all times by both teams [...] there is no separate 'offense' and 'defense'. [...] The team which has possession of the ball {{at any given time}} will normally try to keep it, while the other team will try to recapture it, or at least deny the team in possession the chance to attack and/or force it to kick the ball away or commit an error. [...] One team will initially gain possession of the ball, either from the kick-off, a restart kick or a set piece (scrum and line-out, see below). The need to maintain possession means the team with the ball will usually seek to progress towards the opposition by running forward while carrying the ball; although if there are few opportunities to attack they may choose to kick the ball forward, from the hand, usually giving it back to the opposition but in a position from where {{it will be difficult to}} attack. The ball may be thrown from one player to another (passing) but must not be thrown forward, that is towards the opposition dead-ball line. [...] Any teammate ahead of the ball-carrier is offside and must not interfere with play. [...] So American football style-blocking is forbidden, although tackling or obstructing a player who does not have the ball is against the laws anyway, whether or not the tackling player is offside. [...] The team not in possession attempts to stop the ball-carrier by grabbing and bringing them to ground (a tackle). [...] A tackled player, once having been brought to ground, must immediately pass or release the ball, allowing the two teams to contest possession of the loose ball; if the attacking player is tackled but the tackler releases the ball carrier the ball carrier may get up and continue the play. [...] Play does not stop unless there is an infringement of the Laws, the ball/ball-carrier leaves the field of play, the ball becomes unplayable after a tackle, or the attacking team scores points by either touching the ball over the goal-line (a try) or drop-kicking the ball over the crossbar. [...] If the ball or ball-carrier goes into touch (<b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> of play), the game restarts with a line-out. If the game stops due to an infringement, play restarts with either a scrum, free kick or penalty kick (depending on the nature of the infringement) to the non-infringing team.|$|E
