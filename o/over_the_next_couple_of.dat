5|$|On March 19, the JTWC {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} disturbance that was located about 1145km (710mi) {{to the northwest}} of Suva, Fiji. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days the system moved towards the south and gradually developed further {{in an area of}} low vertical windshear, before the system was designated as Tropical Depression 23P by the JTWC and RSMC Nadi on March 21. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days, 23P moved further towards the south, before the depression started to move towards the southwest as a ridge of high pressure strengthened on March 23. Later that day, RSMC Nadi reported that the depression had intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone and named it as Beti. During that day, Beti continued to develop further before the system moved into the Coral Sea on March 24, after passing over the Vanuatuan islands of Pentecost and Malekula. As Beti moved into the Coral Sea, the system quickly intensified further, with RSMC Nadi reporting on March 25 that Beti had intensified into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. As Beti intensified into a severe tropical cyclone, the ridge of high pressure weakened as it interacted with an upper level trough of low pressure. As a result, the system started to move towards the south-southeast.|$|E

Over the next few days the system gradually developed further as it affected Tuvalu, before it was declared to be a tropical cyclone and named Joni by the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) during December 7. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days the system intensified further as it was steered south-westwards and posed a threat towards the Fijian dependency of Rotuma and the French territory of Wallis and Futuna.

5|$|Hours before {{striking}} the Philippines on November4, both agencies reported Thelma {{to have reached}} its peak intensity. The JTWC estimated the storm to have attained one-minute sustained winds of 85km/h (50mph) while the JMA estimated ten-minute sustained winds at 75km/h (45mph). Additionally, its barometric pressure reached 992mbar (hPa; 29.29inHg). Thelma soon made landfall in Samar before weakening to a minimal tropical storm. Maintaining gale-force winds, the system eventually passed over Palawan Island on November6 before moving over the South China Sea. Despite being back over water, strong wind shear prevented re-intensification and caused Thelma to weaken to a tropical depression by November7. Now moving westward, the depression eventually made its final landfall over the Mekong River Delta in Southern Vietnam on November8. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days the system weakened into an {{area of low pressure}} as it moved westwards, before it moved into the Andaman Sea during November 10.

5|$|On December 13, the US Navy {{started to}} monitor {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather that was located about 720km (480mi), {{to the east of}} Honiara in the Solomon Islands.

On December 15, the NPMOC initiated advisories on the depression and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 04P, while it was located about 110km (70mi) to the northeast of Labasa, Fiji. Later that day, the NPMOC reported that the system had become a tropical storm and reached its peak 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 65km/h (40mph), as it affected several Fijian islands including Vanua Levu and Thikombia. During December 16, the cyclone continued to move towards the southeast and started to affect Tonga before the NPMOC issued their final warning on the system as it had weakened into a tropical depression. During the next day, the depression moved into TCWC Wellingtons area of responsibility and was subsequently declared extratropical.|$|E

Fletcher shot and killed Dare and was then put under arrest and sent back to the frigate Helderenberg. The next day, 40 cavalry and 400foot soldiers, under the command of Lord Grey and Wade, moved on to the nearby town of Bridport, where they encountered 1,200 men from the local royalist Dorset militia. The skirmish ended with the retreat of Grey and the cavalry followed by Wade with the foot soldiers. Many of the militiamen deserted and joined Monmouth's army. Following this confrontation, Lord Albermarle led a royalist force from Exeter towards the forces of the Duke of Somerset, who were approaching Lyme Regis from the opposite direction.|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Sina was {{the only}} named {{tropical}} cyclone to develop within the South Pacific basin during the 1990–91 season. The system was first noted as a shallow depression within the South Pacific Convergence Zone {{to the west of}} Wallis Island.

Sina subsequently peaked in intensity during November 26, before the system passed through the Fijian Islands over the next two days as it started to gradually weaken. Sina subsequently passed just to the north of Tongatapu in Tonga during November 29, before it passed about 160km (100mi) to the south of Niue and near the Southern Cook Islands during the next day. The system subsequently rapidly weakened and became an extratropical cyclone during December 1, before they were absorbed by an advancing trough of low pressure near 50°S on December 4.|$|E
5|$|The remnant trough {{proceeded}} northwestward {{into the}} Bahamas, where the NHC assessed a high chance of redevelopment based on relenting upper wind shear. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days, it moved over the Bahamas and proceeded east of southern Florida. Late on August6, the trough {{developed a new}} center of circulation and regenerated into a weak tropical depression by 1800UTC near Grand Bahama. Emily briefly reattained tropical storm strength six hours later, although it once again dissipated to a remnant low the next day owing to increasing wind shear. The low took on an accelerated east-northeastward motion, bypassing Bermuda before heading eastward over the open Atlantic. It briefly retained a broad area of gale-force winds with deep convection, which prompted the NHC to remonitor the system. The combination of strong wind shear and its rapid forward speed inhibited significant development, and the remnant dissipated around 1200UTC on August11, about 980mi (1,565km) west of the Azores.|$|E

Marcus Ericsson was handed a drive-through penalty for having his team work on his car less than 15 seconds before the restart.

Two laps later, Verstappen was in as well, but a slow pit stop lost him time. On lap 35, Rosberg took the lead as Vettel made a pit stop, who also lost time due to a mistake during his stop.

5|$|During {{the advance}} on Finschhafen, a company from the 2/17th Battalion, {{which had been}} tasked with {{securing}} the beachhead and the flank, {{had been sent to}} Sattelberg but had been unable to occupy it due to the strength of the Japanese force already there. As captured orders had revealed Japanese plans to breakthrough to the coast, it was decided to place the company into a blocking position east of Sattelberg along the coast road around Jivevaneng. In this position, from 25 September onwards they were subjected to a number of attacks as they attempted to deflect attacks by the Japanese 3rd Battalion, 80th Infantry Regiment, which were aimed at breaking through to Heldsbach Plantation, directly south of the beachhead at Siki Cove. On 30 September the 2/17th were replaced by a company from the 2/43rd Battalion, and <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days, a whole battalion of Japanese surrounded the position and attacked it eight times. Four attempts by the Australians to relieve the company failed, before an attack on Kumawa by the 2/17th Battalion on 5 October cut the Japanese supply lines and provoked a strong counterattack, which subsequently drew pressure off the beleaguered company, and enabled it to be relieved on 7 October. As the threat of Japanese counterattack grew, the 24th Brigade landed at Langemak Bay on 10 October to reinforce the 20th Brigade. The following day, Wootten was able to establish his divisional headquarters at Finschhafen, and preparations began for the Australians to attack the Japanese force around Sattelberg.|$|E
