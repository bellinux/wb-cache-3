5|$|In {{addition}} to the 271 people on board the aircraft, two employees at a nearby repair garage were killed and two more severely burned. At 273 victims, this was the deadliest accident in US aviation history. The crash scene is a field northwest of the intersection of Touhy Avenue (Illinois Route 72) and Mount Prospect Road on the border <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs</b> of Des Plaines and Mount Prospect, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Mount Pleasant Road {{is a major}} {{arterial}} thoroughfare in the Canadian city of Toronto, Ontario that travels from Jarvis Street {{south of}} Bloor Street north to Glen Echo Drive. The road is unique {{as one of the}} few arterial roads in Toronto to be created after the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs</b> which it passes through. These include the wealthy Rosedale, Moore Park and Lawrence Park neighbourhoods. The road also passes through the centre of Mount Pleasant Cemetery, after which it takes its name.|$|E
50|$|Two {{parks and}} {{reserves}} {{are located in}} <b>the</b> <b>suburb</b> <b>of</b> White Gum Valley: Davies Reserve in <b>the</b> west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb,</b> and Valley Park in <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb.</b> <b>The</b> Royal Fremantle Golf Club (Inc.) and Fremantle Golf Course are located to <b>the</b> north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb,</b> in Fremantle.|$|R

Cobram East borders <b>the</b> north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb,</b> Katamatite borders <b>the</b> west and south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb,</b> and Boosey borders <b>the</b> east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>suburb</b> {{is mainly}} {{residential}} on <b>the</b> eastern side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb.</b> <b>The</b> {{area between the}} Eyre Highway and the Stuart Highway on <b>the</b> west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb’s</b> built area is zoned for industrial use. The Port Augusta Airport is located to <b>the</b> south end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb</b> and is separated from the residential area by open space and a “vegetation buffer”.|$|R
5|$|Officially {{designated}} as Yeovil Municipal Borough in 1854, the town continued to lend {{its name to}} the area with the creation of the local government district of Yeovil on 1 April 1974, with the merging several neighbouring rural and urban districts, which is today known as South Somerset. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs</b> fall within the civil parishes of Yeovil Without and Brympton.|$|E
5|$|Public {{transport}} {{is based}} on a fairly dense network of tram and bus routes operated by a municipal company, supplemented by a number of private minibus operators. Local trains connect some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs.</b> The bulk of the city's historic area {{has been turned into a}} pedestrian zone with rickshaws and horse-drawn carriages; however, the tramlines run within a three-block radius (pictured). The historic means of transportation in the city can be examined at the Museum of Municipal Engineering in the Kazimierz district, with many old trams, cars and buses.|$|E
5|$|The busway follows {{roughly the}} Torrens River valley, but with {{smoother}} curves. This {{means that it}} crosses the river quite often, with either a park or a few houses on a point surrounded by the river and busway. This occurs a total of eight times before the busway reaches Klemzig Interchange {{on the north side}} of the river. The busway crosses the river again soon after Klemzig and passes Lochiel Park and part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs</b> of Campbelltown and Paradise to its north between the busway and the river before reaching Paradise Interchange.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>suburb</b> {{is located}} on Avenida Italia, {{southwest}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city and northwest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb</b> Mandubí. <b>The</b> stream Arroyo Sauzal flows along <b>the</b> western limits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> north-west portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb,</b> {{centred on}} Breakfast Creek Road, is {{predominantly}} commercial, with <b>the</b> remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb</b> now mainly residential.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> southwestern corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb</b> {{includes}} residential housing, however <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb</b> is industrial. Industry includes recycling, {{manufacturing and}} freight forwarding.|$|R
5|$|To the {{southwest}} of the town centre is Beckery, which was once a village {{in its own right}} but is now part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs.</b> Around the 7th and 8th centuries it was occupied by a small monastic community associated with a cemetery. Archaeological excavations in 2016 uncovered 50 to 60 skeletons thought to be those of monks from Beckery Chapel during the 5th or early 6th century.|$|E
5|$|Many Scottish names {{occur in}} Otago and Southland (the Lammerlaws, Invercargill, Wedderburn, Glenfalloch) and Scottish {{settlers}} also named Riccarton and the Avon River in Christchurch. Canterbury has an English flavour to its nomenclature with Christchurch and Oxford, but also contains Belfast and French names throughout the Akaroa area. Scandinavian migrants left their {{mark in the}} Seventy Mile Bush with Dannevirke and Norsewood and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs</b> and streets of Auckland and Wellington reflect Australian immigration (Footscray and Botany Downs). There is very little Asian influence in New Zealand place naming, with Khandallah in Wellington and Cashmere (Kashmir) in Christchurch, reflecting British imperial connections rather than Indian influence.|$|E
5|$|As more middle-class and {{affluent}} people {{fled the}} city to the relative quiet and open spaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs,</b> the urban centers deteriorated and lost population. At the same time that cities were experiencing a lower tax base due to the flight of higher income earners, pressures from The New Deal forced them to offer pensions and other benefits, increasing the average cost of benefits per employee by 1,629percent. This was in addition to hiring an average of 20percent more employees to serve the ever shrinking cities. More Americans were driving cars and fewer were using public transportation, and it was not practical to extend to the suburbs. At the same time, the number of surface roads exploded to serve the ever-increasing numbers of individually owned cars, further burdening city and country resources. During this time, the perception of using public transportation turned more negative. In what is arguably the most extreme example, Detroit, the fifth largest city in the United States in 1950 with 1,849,568 residents, had shrunk to 706,585 by 2010, a reduction of 62 percent.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{southern}} boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb</b> follows <b>the</b> Bremer River. The Warrego Highway {{passes from}} east to west across <b>the</b> northern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb.</b> Raymonds Hill is a locality within <b>the</b> <b>suburb</b> <b>of</b> North Ipswich.|$|R
50|$|Glenlyon Road is <b>the</b> western {{boundary}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb</b> and by <b>the</b> railway line to {{the north}} and east. Gladstone-Benaraby Road passes through <b>the</b> eastern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb.</b>|$|R
50|$|Almost all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb's</b> {{land area}} is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brisbane Water National Park, and the Pacific Motorway and Pacific Highway {{pass through the}} west and north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb.</b>|$|R
25|$|Music on Long Island (Nassau and Suffolk) is {{strongly}} influenced by the proximity to New York City and by the youth culture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs.</b>|$|E
25|$|Launceston {{combines}} steep (originally heavily wooded) {{ridges and}} low-lying areas (originally wetlands – with parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs</b> of Inveresk and Invermay below high-tide level).|$|E
25|$|In London, fires {{broke out}} within {{half an hour}} of each other in shops in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs.</b> The British police {{established}} that in each case the fire was due to a chemical mixture which ignited when exposed to the air.|$|E
50|$|As <b>the</b> <b>suburb</b> is {{bounded by}} the Brisbane River and Oxley Creek, parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb</b> are {{susceptible}}, in extreme circumstances, to flooding. Parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb</b> are also susceptible to landslip, {{as demonstrated in}} the 1974 Corinda Landslip.|$|R
50|$|The Pimpama River marks <b>the</b> {{northern}} boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb,</b> which {{flows from}} the Darlington Range at Kingsholme down to Moreton Bay. Hotham Creek also flows through <b>the</b> <b>suburb</b> and meets with Pimpama River to <b>the</b> north-east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>suburb</b> {{is served}} {{by a number of}} Transperth bus routes {{operated}} by Transdev WA. The 372 (Mirrabooka-Darch) covers Marangaroo Drive and inner portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suburb,</b> <b>the</b> 389 (Perth-Wanneroo) covers Wanneroo Road, and the 386 (Perth-Marangaroo) routes along with various routes from Mirrabooka bus station cover other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb.</b>|$|R
25|$|St. Michael, South Malling {{dates from}} 1628 and was {{once in a}} village of its own. The {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs</b> has connected South Malling to Lewes although the church mainatins its village setting by the River Ouse, with the neighbouring rectory.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs</b> of Sunderland are {{situated}} towards {{the west of}} the city centre with 70% of its population living {{on the south side of}} the river and 30% on the north side. The city extends to the seafront at Hendon and Ryhope in the south and Seaburn in the north.|$|E
25|$|Residents of Stockholm {{are known}} as Stockholmers. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs</b> have large populations of immigrants. Languages spoken in Greater Stockholm outside of Swedish include Finnish, one of the {{official}} minority languages of Sweden; and English, as well as Bosnian, Syriac, Arabic, Turkish, Kurdish, Persian, Dutch, Spanish, Serbian and Croatian.|$|E
50|$|The Paluma Range National Park is in <b>the</b> north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb</b> and <b>the</b> Rollingstone State Forest is in <b>the</b> south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb.</b> Crystal Creek (<b>the</b> creek {{from which}} <b>the</b> <b>suburb</b> takes its name) {{is a major}} tourist {{attraction}} in the area.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>suburb</b> is irregularly shaped, {{covering}} an area {{of approximately}} 5.5 km2. While mainly residential in nature, the entire south-western part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb</b> is occupied by Blackbutt Reserve, a 182 ha nature reserve consisting primarily <b>of</b> natural bushland. <b>The</b> east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb</b> is predominantly level {{and only a few}} metres above sea level, but rises to approximately 90 m above mean sea level in the western areas, <b>the</b> highest parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb</b> being in Blackbutt Reserve.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>suburb</b> {{features}} three schools, Hallett Cove School (R-12) {{which was}} established in 1987 and is situated in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb.</b> Hallett Cove East Primary School (R-7) exists in the Karrara estate on <b>the</b> northern side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb.</b> <b>The</b> Hallett Cove South School (R-7) is the oldest school in <b>the</b> <b>suburb</b> and is situated near the Hallett Cove School (R-12).|$|R
25|$|With a {{reputation}} as a reformer during his tenure as councilman, he ran for mayor on a platform that promised to transform local government, make the city safer for residents, expand programs and services, and stabilize taxes. He also set out to make Jersey City the destination of choice, in lieu <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs,</b> for the young urbanites and new families moving from Manhattan.|$|E
25|$|In 1968 the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) {{published}} {{a series of}} reports, known simply as the HUD reports, that described the problems in modern cities due to {{the rapid expansion of}} suburbs in the 1950s. The rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs</b> led to a flight of capital from the city centres, which in turn led to the widespread urban decay seen in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|From 1955 to 1988, German-built trams were used. The first Czechoslovakian-built tram {{arrived in}} 1973. In 2007, 56 Tatra KT4SUs, 12 KTNF6s (rebuilt KT4SUs) and 23 KT4Ds (used trams bought from Germany) are in use. There are four lines, with total length of tramlines 39km. Plans {{have been in}} the works since the late 1970s to open a light rail line from one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs,</b> Lasnamäe, to the city centre. The {{deadlines}} have been postponed many times.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{boundaries}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb</b> {{are determined}} by the Great Eastern Highway, Tonkin Highway and Epsom Avenue, Belmont, and <b>the</b> grounds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Perth International Airport which lie on <b>the</b> eastern edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Kershaw Botanic Gardens and the Tom Nutley Field are along <b>the</b> {{south-western}} edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb</b> with Queen's Park on <b>the</b> {{southern tip}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburb,</b> beside <b>the</b> Fitzroy River {{and the road}} bridge.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>suburb</b> {{is home to}} {{a number}} of {{families}} and retirees of predominantly Anglo-Celtic background.
