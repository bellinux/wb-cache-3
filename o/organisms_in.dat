50|$|Thus, all {{descriptions}} {{are with}} respect to the <b>organism</b> <b>in</b> its standard anatomical position, even when the <b>organism</b> <b>in</b> question has appendages in another position.

25|$|Because {{animals can}} change {{orientation}} {{with respect to}} their environment, and because appendages like limbs and tentacles can change position with respect to the main body, positional descriptive terms need to refer to the animal as in its standard anatomical position. All descriptions are with respect to the <b>organism</b> <b>in</b> its standard anatomical position, even when the <b>organism</b> <b>in</b> question has appendages in another position. This helps avoid confusion in terminology when referring to the same <b>organism</b> <b>in</b> different postures.|$|R

5|$|Archaeal lipid tails {{differ from}} those of other <b>organisms</b> <b>in</b> that they are based upon long isoprenoid chains with {{multiple}} side-branches, sometimes with cyclopropane or cyclohexane rings. By contrast, the fatty acids in the membranes of other organisms have straight chains without side branches or rings. Although isoprenoids {{play an important role in}} the biochemistry of many organisms, only the archaea use them to make phospholipids. These branched chains may help prevent archaeal membranes from leaking at high temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman is {{considered}} to be a keystone species whose presence in the ecosystem maintains a healthy balance of <b>organisms.</b> <b>In</b> its absence, fish, such as piranhas, might dominate the environment. The eggs and newly hatched young of Cuvier's dwarf caiman are most at risk and are preyed on by birds, snakes, rats, raccoons and other mammals. Adult caimans are protected by the bony osteoderms under the scales and their main predators are jaguars, green anacondas (Eunectes murinus) and large boa constrictors (Boa constrictor).|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the large}} amount of effort focused at {{controlling}} insects, human attempts to kill pests with insecticides can backfire.

The effects of DDT's use exemplifies how some insecticides can threaten wildlife beyond intended populations of pest insects.|$|E

5|$|Despite their {{apparent}} simplicity, {{bacteria can}} form complex associations with other organisms. These symbiotic associations {{can be divided}} into parasitism, mutualism and commensalism. Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and grow on animals and plants exactly as they will grow on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth and sweat, and large populations of these <b>organisms</b> <b>in</b> humans are the cause of body odour.|$|E
5|$|Genomics {{is central}} to malaria research.

5|$|However, {{languages}} {{differ from}} biological <b>organisms</b> <b>in</b> that they readily incorporate elements from other languages {{through the process}} of diffusion, as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their first language or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming endangered as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Alan Turing (1912–1954), {{better known}} {{for his work on}} {{computing}} and codebreaking, wrote The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, an analysis of the mechanisms that would be needed to create patterns in living <b>organisms,</b> <b>in</b> the process called morphogenesis. He predicted oscillating chemical reactions, in particular the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns of stripes and spots in animals, and contribute to the spiral patterns seen in plant phyllotaxis.|$|E
