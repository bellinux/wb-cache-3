5|$|Also {{dating from}} this time is Beauchief Abbey, which was founded by Robert FitzRanulf de Alfreton. The abbey was {{dedicated}} to Saint Mary and Saint Thomas Becket, who had been canonised in 1172. Thomas Tanner, writing in 1695, stated that {{it was founded in}} 1183.

He returned to the papal court, then at Auxerre, in 1147, but {{he was back in}} England by {{the time of his death}} the following year. Henry of Huntingdon says that Alexander picked up his last illness while travelling. Alexander died in February 1148, probably on the 20th, as that was the date on which his death was commemorated at Lincoln Cathedral, and he was buried at Lincoln on 25 February 1148. No tomb remains, but 12th-century documents record that Alexander left the cathedral a number of books, mostly biblical works.|$|E
5|$|During the {{preliminary}} hearing in late July, prosecutors presented testimonies from Jew's neighbors at both of his homes, indicating that Jew had never lived in his 28th Avenue house {{and spent most of}} his time in Burlingame. Testimony from a U.S. Postal Service inspector revealed that Jew's first-class mail went to Burlingame while junk mail went to his San Francisco address; prosecutors cited utility bills showing low usage of water and electricity at his 28th Avenue home, as well as loan applications that indicated he lived in Burlingame. In his defense, Jew produced a jury duty summons to indicate his address in San Francisco, and questioned the possible bias <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> against him.|$|E

5|$|In February 1194 Coutances was in Germany, at {{the court}} of the German emperor, along with Longchamp, who brought letters to Richard, still in captivity. On 4 February, Coutances became a hostage to the German emperor as surety for the payment of the {{outstanding}} portion of Richard's ransom, and the king was released. The king never paid the final instalment of his ransom, and the archbishop had to pay 10,000 marks for his own release. From that point onwards Coutances was no longer involved with English politics or government, and {{spent the rest of}} his career on Norman affairs. His record of charter witnessing bears this out; between 1189 and 1194 Coutances was among the most prolific <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> to the king's English charters, but not after 1194.|$|E
5|$|On July 28, {{the trial}} {{began at the}} Fulton County Superior Court (old city hall building). The judge, Leonard S. Roan, had been serving as a judge in Georgia since 1900.

Frank was represented {{by a team of}} eight lawyersincluding jury selection specialistsled by Luther Rosser, Reuben Arnold, and Herbert Haas. In addition to the hundreds of spectators inside, a large crowd gathered outside to watch the trial through the windows.

5|$|Simpson {{opened his}} own chemist shop in Brunswick West in 1918. On 12 August 1919 he married Jean Elizabeth Watson at the Congregational Church in Ascot Vale, Victoria. Their {{marriage}} produced two children, {{a son who}} died in infancy and a daughter, Jean Marjorie. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> at their wedding ceremony was a fellow Militia officer, Alan Ramsay, who later married Jean's sister Edna. In 1937, Simpson banded together with D. E. Robertson and A. E. Moore to create the Allied Master Chemists of Australia Ltd, today better known as Amcal. They invited other pharmacists to join them to compete against the growing market power of major retailers. The business grew from 12 members in 1937 to over 100 by 1946.

5|$|The Court {{concluded}} that the conflict of interest materialized in a few ways. First, Stewart declined to cross-examine one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>witnesses,</b> who could implicate Kretske but not Glasser, for fear that it would strengthen the case against Kretske. Stewart also failed to object to the testimony of other witnesses regarding prior statements of Kretske; under the rules of hearsay, these statements were obviously admissible against Kretske, but less obviously admissible against Glasser without a predicate showing that Glasser was a co-conspirator. Stewart feared that an objection only on behalf of Glasser would highlight the admissibility of the statements against Kretske.|$|E
5|$|Warelwast {{may have}} been with the hunting party on 2 August 1100 in which King William was accidentally killed, as he was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> to the letter sent on 5August 1100 from William IIs brother, the new King Henry I to Anselm recalling the archbishop. King Henry {{continued}} to use Warelwast as an ambassador, sending him to Rome in 1101 to bring back Pope Paschal II's reply to a letter written by Henry immediately after his accession. Henry was seeking a reconciliation with the papacy, and confirmed to the pope the rights and obedience which his father had rendered, but he also requested the same rights within the Church as his father had enjoyed, chiefly the lay investiture of bishops and the granting of the symbols of episcopal authority by laymen. Paschal declined to grant Henry those rights.|$|E
5|$|De Gray's {{ability to}} raise money made him useful to John. In 1213 de Gray mustered 500knights during a period when Philip II was {{threatening}} to invade England, bringing this force over from Ireland along with mounted men-at-arms to support the king in England. In May 1213, John and Innocent finally resolved the dispute over Langton's election to Canterbury, {{and part of the}} settlement was that John gave Ireland and England to Innocent and received them back from the pope, making John a papal vassal. The settlement was sealed with a treaty, to which de Gray was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>witnesses.</b> After John settled with the papacy, de Gray {{was not included in the}} general pardon, and had to go to Rome to be pardoned. While in that city the bishop was named as one of the guarantors of a new financial arrangement between the king and the pope dealing with feudal payments from England, which lowered the lump sum that had to be paid before Innocent would lift the interdict. After Innocent pardoned de Gray, the pope recommended his election as Bishop of Durham in 1213; but de Gray died during his journey back to England on 18 October 1214, at Saint-Jean-d'Angély in Poitou. He was buried in Norwich Cathedral, but his tomb has not survived.|$|E

5|$|In her spare time, Veronica trails Madison out of envy. After ascertaining Tim’s password, Veronica {{finds out}} that Tim is also {{investigating}} the Dean’s suicide {{and that he was}} browsing a site named “Neptune Women’s Clinic”. Veronica visits the ministry of Bonnie’s father, Ted (Chris Ellis) as well as the clinic, although neither really help in the case. She also questions Anthony, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> of the Dean’s death (he heard the gunshot). Returning home, Veronica is greeted by Keith, who has received a letter with images of Veronica exiting the clinic. For revenge, they visit the publisher of the photos, but it doesn’t go well. Nevertheless, she does see a picture of one of Dick’s paramours, although she was not as intimate with him as Veronica thought. In the middle of the night, Mindy O’Dell (Jaime Ray Newman) contact Keith, telling him to hurry.

5|$|Jack {{eventually}} married Polly in 1915, {{after they}} had moved to Elmore Street, Everton. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> at the wedding was Polly's sister, Catherine Seddon. Daughter Edith Lennon was born that year and then Charles (21 November 1918 – 26 May 2002). The Lennons moved back to Toxteth Park, and Jack died in 1921, at 57 Copperfield Street. He was buried on 6th August 1921 at Allerton Cemetery. His grave, number 206 in Roman Catholic section 4, is an unmarked public grave. Polly could not read or write, but {{was reported to be}} very humorous and supposedly had psychic abilities. After Jack died, Polly did not have enough money to keep the whole Lennon family together, so she placed two of her children, Alf and Edith, in the Blue Coat School Orphanage. It was situated just around the corner from Newcastle Road (where Julia Stanley lived). Polly died on 30 January 1949.|$|E
5|$|Neville {{was present}} at the Council of Clarendon, where he was among the king's followers. Neville was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> to the Constitutions of Clarendon, which came out of the Council. In 1166 he was named chief {{forester}} of the royal forests, an office that was responsible for the royal officials in charge of administrating the forests as well as the system of royal courts that enforced the forest law. Neville headed the royal efforts to enforce the forest law, which banned cutting down timber, clearing new farm fields, poaching, or the creation of enclosures within the royal forest. Any offences against the forest law were subject to monetary fines, which were an important source of royal revenue. The royal forest included not only the forests owned by the king, but also many forests on lands held by other persons. After Neville's appointment as chief forester, {{he was in charge of}} hearing offences against the forest law and also imposing punishments. His activities were resented by the people subject to forest law.|$|E

40|$|This {{doctoral}} study, {{composed of}} four films and an exegesis, configures a new conceptualisation {{of death in}} and through film, assembling an intricate theorisation of ‘the mediated I’ and ‘the unmediated I’ <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness.</b> This thesis focuses on <b>the</b> consciousness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness,</b> through locating a position and expression in reflective, reflexive, experiential, critical and artistic practice. My research questions <b>the</b> <b>witness’s</b> attempt to ‘manage’ the experience and tracks the self reflective process of thought s/he undertakes in <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> death, dying, coma and suffering. In probing <b>the</b> subjective experiences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness,</b> <b>the</b> knowledge <b>of</b> disaster and <b>the</b> absent Other gives way to a moment <b>of</b> distinction between <b>the</b> spectator and <b>the</b> <b>witness.</b> <b>The</b> actual movement being proposed {{between the two is}} through {{the ways in which they}} both are activated through <b>the</b> reality <b>of</b> death. Critical and creative practice encourages a recognition of - and identification with - the possible meditations and negotiations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness.</b> It aims to infuse a configuration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> by way <b>of</b> reflection in consciousness and artistic formulation. This thesis proposes a conceptual diagnosis as the original contribution to knowledge. I identify apathy as an anti-choice and unrecognised necessity <b>of</b> consciousness in <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> death, dying, coma and suffering. The research offers a new insight into <b>the</b> existential encounter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness.</b> <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> practice component is to re-present and re-vision everyday encounters on television and in media alongside metaphors, possible meditations and negotiations to the subjective experience in and through filmic gaze. The visual propositions complement the written text by means <b>of</b> displaying <b>the</b> fear and anguish <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness,</b> and <b>the</b> attitude towards the Other, disaster and the irrecoverable death. The aim in turning this subject matter into an academic study has been to align two different perceptions: visual and theoretical practice. These two conceptual terms have offered distinct ways <b>of</b> handling <b>the</b> unsettling encounter from not only a witness’s point of view but also from <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> a researcher and the film-maker. Together, the visual and theoretical strategy reveal <b>the</b> workings <b>of</b> consciousness and creative meditation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> to identify <b>the</b> struggles against internal and external terror in being a <b>witness.</b> <b>The</b> research is interdisciplinary, deploying philosophy, literary and artistic theory. Yet it is not a contribution to <b>the</b> specialised discipline <b>of</b> philosophy, sociology or psychoanalysis of death, dying and suffering, but offers a critical and creative matrix combining inventive and reflexive approaches. This practice-based doctoral study challenges the artist and practitioner to create and then raise awareness through a dynamic, reflexive and interpretative discourse. It fuses genres, including autobiography, literary studies and visual arts. The relationship between the exegesis and films provide an innovative pathway through creative meditation and negotiation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> by integrating filmic presentations as an integral loop in the research. Every chapter frames a dialogue between already existing theories of death, dying and grief and filmic texts to transform experience into visuality through constructing a descriptive insight and artistic expression...|$|R
