5|$|Early in the Society's history, {{when its}} focus was still {{primarily}} literary, membership was considered {{by a committee}} {{for three days and}} then voted upon. By 1908, that model had been abandoned in favor of an open system in which any student who paid an annual fee could be part of the group. At that time, Philaletheis was governed by a six-member board consisting of a president and vice-president (both seniors), secretary, treasurer, and props manager (juniors), and an assistant props manager (a sophomore). In 1951, the board was vastly expanded to include managers <b>of</b> <b>scenery,</b> lights, sound, makeup, publicity, {{and a number of other}} fields.|$|E

5|$|Mount Washington {{has been}} the subject of several famous paintings, part of a New England school of art known as White Mountain art. Inspired by the Hudson River School of {{landscape}} painting, a number of artists during the Victorian era ventured into the White Mountains in search of natural subjects. Train service in the area spurred increased tourism and the construction of the Glen House where Albert Bierstadt and his photographer brother (Bierstadt Brothers) stayed. John P. Soule, John B. Heywood and the Kilburn Brothers also produced stereographic images <b>of</b> <b>scenery</b> in the area.|$|E
5|$|The Metamorfosis World Tour was a {{worldwide}} concert tour by Guatemalan singer–songwriter Ricardo Arjona {{in support of}} his thirteenth studio album, Independiente. Beginning in January 2012, it was Arjona's first tour since leaving Warner Music to become an independent artist. The tour was announced in December 2011 with dates at American, Argentinian and Chilean venues, and received a positive critical response. The show was designed for a revolving stage, with Arjona performing while the scenery changed with the songs being performed. Four changes <b>of</b> <b>scenery</b> were developed: a two-floor apartment, a bar, a circus and a theatre. The number of songs played at each show varied from 19 to 23.|$|E
5|$|Keswick {{is in the}} lee of the Skiddaw group, {{the oldest}} group of rocks in the Lake District. These fells were formed during the Ordovician period, 488 to 443 million years ago; they form a {{triangle}} sheltering the town, reaching a maximum height of 931m on Skiddaw itself. To the west of Portinscale, to the south-west of the village of Thornthwaite, is Whinlatter Forest Park and Grisedale Pike. To the east, beyond Castlerigg stone circle, is St John's in the Vale, {{at the foot of the}} Helvellyn range, which is popular with ramblers starting from Keswick.

5|$|When King {{bought the}} {{painting}} {{it consisted of}} 13 panels sewn together and rolled into one piece. To more easily store and transport the painting King unstitched the 13 panels and stored them individually together with two separate panels <b>of</b> <b>scenery</b> {{used to make the}} painting a bit longer depending on the exhibition space. The 13 panels along with the two extra scenery panels bring the painting to 410 feet long according to King. The painting has, for the most part, remained rolled up since 1933, though it was donated by King to Wake Forest University upon his death in 1996. The university sold the painting in 2007 to an anonymous group of Raleigh, North Carolina, investors. The painting has been appraised at a value of US$5.5 million, but the value of the sale remains unknown. The group intends to resell the painting to a new buyer who will commit to restoring the work and building a suitable structure to house it.|$|E

25|$|Torelli {{was born}} in Fano, where he may have first worked on amateur theatre {{productions}} at the Palazzo della Ragione, and he may also have gained experience in theatre design in nearby Pesaro or Urbino. His first documented work was in January 1641 {{for the opening of}} the Teatro Novissimo in Venice, where he was involved in the design <b>of</b> <b>scenery</b> and stage machinery for Francesco Sacrati's opera La finta pazza. This was followed with designs for two other works by Sacrati at the same theatre, Bellerofonte in 1642 and Venere gelosa in January 1643. He may also have worked on Francesco Cavalli's Deidamia, staged in 1644, also at the Teatro Novissimo. Torelli's last work in Venice was for Sacrati's L'Ulisse errante, performed during the carnival season of 1644 at the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo.|$|E
25|$|After {{dropping}} game one, the Drillers {{found themselves}} {{not only with}} a bit more pressure on them for the rematch, but also without a home. As the Drillers gave up Skyreach Centre so that Shania Twain could add an Edmonton date to her tour.

After getting behind early, the change <b>of</b> <b>scenery</b> didn’t hurt the team in the long run though, as they posted 19–15 come from behind victory in front of an overflow crowd. The win gave the team a 23–17 record, and clinched the division and conference titles.

25|$|The {{departure}} from Melbourne – {{just one year}} into a three-year deal with the club – {{was the end of}} a tumultuous period for Gleeson, who had been supporting his wife through a successful battle with breast cancer. Gleeson was left emotionally drained and on the lookout for his next professional challenge. For a time he found that challenge elsewhere, working with the Australian Football League's North Melbourne and Hawthorn football clubs as a skills coach during 2012–13. It was an interesting change <b>of</b> <b>scenery</b> and, in many ways, a year of growth for Gleeson. Under masterful coach Alastair Clarkson, Hawthorn was on the precipice of a golden era of premiership success and it was there that Gleeson learned some of the key elements of his current coaching philosophy. He learnt the importance of core sporting-team principles such as empowering players to lead a team's culture and standards.|$|E
25|$|In 1913, the Galerie Hans Goltz, Munich, mounted Schiele's {{first solo}} show. A solo {{exhibition}} {{of his work}} took place in Paris in 1914. During the war Schiele's paintings became larger and more detailed, {{when he had the}} time to produce them. His military service however gave him limited time, and much of his output consisted of linear drawings <b>of</b> <b>scenery</b> and military officers. Around this time Schiele also began experimenting with the theme of motherhood and family. His wife Edith was the model for most of his female figures, but during the war due to circumstance, many of his sitters were male. Since 1915, Schiele's female nudes had become fuller in figure, but many were deliberately illustrated with a lifeless doll-like appearance. Towards the end of his life, Schiele drew many natural and architectural subjects. His last few drawings consisted of female nudes, some in masturbatory poses.|$|E
25|$|Staging and {{presentation}} {{were of a}} high standard, {{under the direction of}} Louis P. Verande (assisted by George King), from Covent Garden where he had been responsible for the staging of Thomas Beecham's controversial 1910 Salome. Verande also had extensive Continental and American experience. All the costumes were designed by Dorothy Carleton Smyth from Glasgow, an authority on historical pageant and theatrical costumes, who travelled with the company. Quinlan pointed out that she concentrated on a harmoniously blended colour scheme, eschewing extraneous spangles and similar gewgaws. The sets for all the operas were designed by Oliver Percy Bernard, from the Boston Opera, and set models for the Puccini operas were first passed by the composer; while Humperdinck, Debussy, Cosima Wagner, Ricordi and other authorities lent their assistance with others. Quinlan claimed the largest scenic studio in England and said that a great deal of research had been done on the historical accuracy of stage accessories. The cost of moving the company and all the baggage — 365 tons <b>of</b> <b>scenery,</b> props and costumes — around the world was £100,000.|$|E
