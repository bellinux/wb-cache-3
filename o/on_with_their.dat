5|$|Death {{has always}} been a {{critical}} moment for those bereaved, and consequently death is surrounded by taboo-like rules. Family life has to be reorganized and in order to master such transitions, people use rites. The ceremonies are transitional rites that are intended to give the deceased peace in his or her new situation {{at the same time as}} they provide strength for the bereaved to carry <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> lives.|$|E

5|$|Public {{reaction}} to the Emperor's speech varied–many Japanese simply listened to it, then went <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> lives as best they could, while some Army and Navy officers chose suicide over surrender. At a base north of Nagasaki, some Japanese Army officers, enraged {{at the prospect of}} surrender, pulled some 16 captured American airmen out of the base prison and hacked them to death with swords. A large, weeping crowd gathered in front of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, with their cries sometimes interrupted by the sound of gunshots as military officers present committed suicide.|$|E

5|$|Some artists {{tried to}} alter their sound, while others {{struggled}} <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> original format. In 1995, Van Halen released Balance, a multi-platinum seller {{that would be the}} band's last with Sammy Hagar on vocals. In 1996, David Lee Roth returned briefly and his replacement, former Extreme singer Gary Cherone, left the band soon after the release of the commercially unsuccessful 1998 album Van Halen III. Van Halen would not tour or record again until 2004. Warrant released Ultraphobic in 1995, an album with more of an alternative/grunge approach, which had little commercial success.|$|E
5|$|Ted {{tells the}} story of John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) and his talking teddy bear (MacFarlane) who keeps John and his girlfriend Lori Collins (Mila Kunis) from moving <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> lives. The film {{received}} generally favorable reviews from both critics and audiences, and was a box office success, opening with the highest weekend gross of all time for an original R-rated comedy. Internationally, the movie is currently the highest-grossing original R-rated comedy of all time, beating The Hangover. A sequel, Ted 2, was released on June 26, 2015.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 29 April the Soviet 3rd Shock Army crossed the Moltke bridge and started to fan out into the {{surrounding}} streets and buildings. The initial assaults on buildings, including the Ministry of the Interior, were hampered by the lack of supporting artillery. It was not until the damaged bridges were repaired that artillery could be moved up in support. At 04:00 hours, in the Führerbunker, Hitler signed his last will and testament and, shortly afterwards, married Eva Braun. At dawn the Soviets pressed <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> assault in the south-east. After very heavy fighting they managed to capture Gestapo headquarters on Prinz-Albrechtstrasse, but a Waffen-SS counter-attack forced the Soviets to withdraw from the building. To the south-west the 8th Guards Army attacked north across the Landwehr canal into the Tiergarten.|$|E

5|$|Like {{most other}} revolutionaries, Heliade favored {{maintaining}} {{good relations with}} the Ottoman Empire, Wallachia's suzerain power, hoping that this policy could help counter Russian pressures. As Sultan Abdülmecid I was assessing the situation, Süleyman Paşa was dispatched to Bucharest, where he advised the revolutionaries to carry <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> diplomatic efforts, and ordered the Provisional Government to be replaced by Locotenenţa domnească, a triumvirate of regents comprising Heliade, Tell, and Nicolae Golescu. Nonetheless, the Ottomans were pressured by Russia into joining a clampdown on revolutionary forces, which resulted, during September, in the reestablishment of Regulamentul Organic and its system of government. Together with Tell, Heliade sought refuge at the British consulate in Bucharest, where they were hosted by Robert Gilmour Colquhoun in exchange for a deposit of Austrian florins.|$|E
5|$|One day {{a man by}} {{the name}} of Victor Kennedy (Peter Kay) {{interrupts}} a meeting and points out that LINDA has lost focus. He reinvigorates the group's efforts to locate the Doctor by teaching them spying techniques. Elton is given the task of getting close to Rose Tyler's mother Jackie (Camille Coduri). He manages to meet Jackie at a laundrette and is invited to her apartment. She tries and fails to seduce him, but when she finds a picture of Rose in Elton's jacket she demands that he leave her alone. Meanwhile, Bridget and Bliss disappear from the group unexpectedly. Victor explains their absence by saying that they quit to move <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> lives. After a meeting Elton, Ursula and Mr Skinner stage a walkout. Victor persuades Mr Skinner to remain behind, but Elton and Ursula leave. Ursula realises she forgot her phone, and she returns with Elton only to discover that Victor is an alien, whom Elton dubs an Abzorbaloff. As Ursula and Elton see the faces of the former LINDA members on the Abzorbaloff's body, the alien reveals that he has absorbed them and wishes to also absorb the Doctor to gain his accumulated experience and knowledge. The Abzorbaloff manages to trick Ursula and absorb her as well, before pursuing Elton who attempts to escape.|$|E
5|$|This is an escapist anthem {{about leaving}} {{wherever}} you're stuck, {{getting in a}} car, whacking some amazing music on the stereo and putting your foot down. In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still music making the people come together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") but makes sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's trying too hard to be down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being able to leave the cunts behind to get <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E

25|$|The High Commission is {{mandated}} to help refugees get <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> lives {{as quickly as}} possible, and works to settle them rapidly, most frequently in countries other than those they fled. UNRWA policy, however, states that the Palestinian Arabs who fled from Israel {{in the course of}} the 1948 war, plus all their descendants, are to be considered refugees until a just and durable solution can be found by political actors. UNRWA was specifically designed not to proscribe how the outcome of an agreement would take shape.|$|E
25|$|The Yati Strip was an area {{cleared by}} the SADF just one {{kilometre}} south of Angola, running {{parallel to the}} border. Platoons were typically deposited there by vehicles carrying a limited supply of food and ammunition. Operators then cached {{the bulk of their}} supplies at a position of their choice and carried <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> patrols relatively unhindered. The cache was booby trapped with anti-personnel mines. PLAN had a heavy presence in the area: at the time of deployment at least one cadre was there seeking water. Other insurgents were frequently crossing into Angola from South West Africa, presumably for resupply, before returning there again. They were in collusion with Angolan civilians.|$|E

Anxious to get <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> journey, Lieutenant du Plessis and Philippe Hubert Preudhomme de Borre went aboard the Mercure. Du Plessis paid 400 livres for the price of his passage. Carrying a secret cargo of military supplies, the vessel left Saint-Nazaire on 5 February 1777. The Mercure reached Portsmouth, New Hampshire on 17 March and de Borre arrived at Morristown, New Jersey exactly two months later. Appointed captain of artillery in the Continental Army, du Plessis' commission dated from 15 April 1777. He fought at the Battle of Brandywine on 11 September.|$|E
25|$|North Dakota was {{far away}} from the centers of the hippie {{movement}} on the coasts of the United States, but this did not mean that the local students did not know what was going <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> peers at schools such as UC-Berkeley. The combination of tension between the students and the established powers, and the local and state governments' lack of experience in dealing with large gatherings of angry and drunk protesters led to the riot that would put Zap, North Dakota across the headlines of the U.S. newspapers and make it the lead story on the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. What started out as a lark turned into a riot that resulted in thousands of dollars of damage.|$|E
