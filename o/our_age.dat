In it Feyerabend challenges {{what he sees}} in his view as some modern myths about science, e.g., {{he believes that the}} statement 'science is successful' is a myth. He argues that some very basic assumptions about science are simply false and that substantial parts of scientific ideology were created on the basis of superficial generalizations that led to absurd misconceptions about the nature of human life. He claims that far from solving the pressing problems of <b>our</b> <b>age,</b> scientific theorizing glorifies ephemeral generalities at the cost of confronting the real particulars that make life meaningful.|$|E
25|$|According to {{theories}} of postmodernity, economic and technological conditions of <b>our</b> <b>age</b> have {{given rise to}} a decentralized, media-dominated society in which ideas are only simulacra, inter-referential representations and copies of each other with no real, original, stable or objective source of communication and meaning. Globalization, brought on by innovations in communication, manufacturing and transportation, is often cited as one force which has driven the decentralized modern life, creating a culturally pluralistic and interconnected global society lacking any single dominant center of political power, communication or intellectual production. The postmodernist view is that inter-subjective, not objective, knowledge will be the dominant form of discourse under such conditions and that ubiquity of dissemination fundamentally alters the relationship between reader and that which is read, between observer and the observed, between those who consume and those who produce.|$|E

The anthology helped Griswold build up a considerable reputation throughout the 1840s and 1850s and its first edition went through three printings in only six months. His choice of authors, however, was occasionally questioned. [...] A British editor reviewed the collection and concluded, [...] "with two or three exceptions, {{there is not a}} poet of mark in the whole Union" [...] and referred to the anthology as [...] "the most conspicuous act of martyrdom yet committed {{in the service of the}} transatlantic muses". Even so, the book was popular and was even continued in several editions after Griswold's death by Richard Henry Stoddard.|$|E

500|$|In {{a letter}} to Vera Zasulich dated 8 March 1881, Marx {{contemplated}} the possibility of Russia's bypassing the capitalist stage of development and building communism {{on the basis of}} the common ownership of land characteristic of the village mir. While admitting that Russia's rural [...] "commune is the fulcrum of social regeneration in Russia", Marx also warned that in order for the mir to operate as a means for moving straight to the socialist stage without a preceding capitalist stage it [...] "would first be necessary to eliminate the deleterious influences which are assailing it (the rural commune) from all sides". Given the elimination of these pernicious influences, Marx allowed that [...] "normal conditions of spontaneous development" [...] of the rural commune could exist. However, in the same letter to Vera Zasulich he points out that [...] "at the core of the capitalist system... lies the complete separation of the producer from the means of production". In one of the drafts of this letter, Marx reveals his growing passion for anthropology, motivated by his belief that future communism would be a return on a higher level to the communism of our prehistoric past. He wrote that [...] "the historical trend of <b>our</b> <b>age</b> is the fatal crisis which capitalist production has undergone in the European and American countries where it has reached its highest peak, a crisis that will end in its destruction, in the return of modern society to a higher form of the most archaic type—collective production and appropriation". He added that [...] "the vitality of primitive communities was incomparably greater than that of Semitic, Greek, Roman, etc. societies, and, a fortiori, that of modern capitalist societies". Before he died, Marx asked Engels to write up these ideas, which were published in 1884 under the title The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State.|$|E
