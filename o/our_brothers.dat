500|$|Many of {{the assassins}} {{had belonged to}} the Trujillo regime or had at one point been its staunch supporters, only to find their support for him eroded by the state's crimes against its people.

And now they're killing our women. And here we sit, resigned, waiting our turn." [...] In an interview, Vargas Llosa describes the corruption and brutality of Trujillo's regime: [...] "He had more or less all the common traits of a Latin American dictator, but pushed to the extreme. In cruelty, I think he went far far away from the restand in corruption, too." ...|$|E

Other similar books included Scattered are the Traces (1979), Cavalry Divisions of the Waffen-SS (1982), Panzer Grenadiers of the 'Viking' Division in Pictures (1984) and many others. (One of the cavalry units in question, SS Cavalry Brigade, was responsible for the murder of an estimated 23,700 Jews and others in July–August 1941 alone during the Pripyat swamps punitive operation.

500|$|In late September {{or early}} October 1942, Popovac met with Chetnik leaders Dobroslav Jevđević and Petar Baćović. The three agreed {{to form a}} Muslim Chetnik militia. In October, Popovac enlisted Italian aid in {{fighting}} the Partisans. Popovac's Muslim Chetniks were soon [...] "legalized" [...] by the Italians and listed {{as part of their}} Anti-Communist Volunteer Militia ( [...] ; MVAC). Popovac and Pašić became the political leaders of the Muslim Chetniks, whose militia was formally called the Muslim People's Military Organization ( [...] ; MNVO). Musakadić was appointed the military leader of all the Muslim Chetniks. Another Muslim, Mustafa Mulalić, became the vice-chairman of the Chetnik's Central National Committee. The creation of the MNVO complied with the Chetniks' strategy of turning the Croats and Muslims of eastern Herzegovina against one another. According to Marko Attila Hoare, a historian specializing in the Balkans, the MNVO was part of a greater Muslim autonomist movement. In September 1942, an assembly of Herzegovinian Muslim notables in Mostar declared: [...] "We Herzegovinians and Bosnians are nobody's property and we recognize the right of nobody to persecute us.
