40|$|Demersal, non-cryptic, {{wild fish}} were counted in {{replicate}} 100 m 2 transects beneath a floating sea-cage fish farm and two nearby sandy locations at Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, eastern Atlantic) four times {{before and after}} the cessation <b>of</b> <b>farming.</b> Cessation <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> involved the removal <b>of</b> <b>farmed</b> fish and ceasing of the daily feeding, although farm structures (cages and moorings) remained. A “beyond-BACI” sampling design provided the framework to detect the effect of the cessation <b>of</b> <b>farming,</b> which produced qualitative and quantitative changes in the composition and structure of the fish assemblages beneath the sea-cage fish farm compared with two nearby controls. The aggregative effect on wild fish due to the existence <b>of</b> the <b>farm</b> decreased from approximately 50 times compared to nearby controls when the farm was in full operation to 3 ̆c 2 times when only the farm structures remained. Abundances of POM feeders 3 ̆e(large-sized mugilids), large benthic chondrichthyid rays and Pagellus spp. declined markedly at the fish farm after the cessation <b>of</b> <b>farming,</b> suggesting that the removal of daily feeding was responsible for their disappearance. In contrast, abundances of herbivores, benthic macro- and meso-carnivores were similar beneath the fish farm both {{before and after the}} cessation <b>of</b> <b>farming.</b> Benthic macro-carnivores, however, were more abundant beneath the sea-cages compared to control locations, supporting the hypothesis that the increase in the physical structure beneath farms plays a role in aggregating these species. Sparids occurred beneath the sea-cages only after the cessation <b>of</b> <b>farming,</b> while the two natural control locations did not show differences from before to after the cessation <b>of</b> <b>farming.</b> Overall, the results show that the wild fish assemblage beneath the farm partially changed after the cessation <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> to a more natural state, approaching the assemblages observed at the control sites...|$|R
