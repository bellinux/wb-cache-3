40|$|<b>Online</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions,</b> {{in which}} a buyer seeks to select a {{supplier}} and suppliers compete for contracts by bidding online, revolutionized corporate procurement early this century. Shortly after they had been pioneered by General Electric, many companies rushed to adopt <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions</b> but the adoption soon slowed down due to {{the negative effects of}} auction-induced competition. Today, as firms continue to experiment with the <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions,</b> {{it is important to understand}} how the interplay of the auction context, the service characteristics, and buyer-supplier relationships affects auction outcomes and the success of the auctioned projects. This PhD dissertation investigates <b>online</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions</b> in service industries (e. g. software development, building construction). The differences between services and products (services can be more difficult to describe and require more intensive communication) challenge theories that try to explain auction outcomes. We study several aspects of auctioning service contracts: the buyer’s choice between auctions and negotiations; the contract allocation decisions in auctions; the heterogeneity of buyers’ procurement behaviour; and the effect of auction outcomes on buyer-supplier relationships and project performance during the project execution. Some of the key findings are: 1) that the buyer’s repeat exchange interaction with vendors as well as the satisfaction with a vendor’s past performance lead to the buyer’s preference for using bilateral negotiation to allocate the next project; 2) that there are five buyers’ tactics that allow to increase the likelihood of contract allocation; 3) that the outcomes of <b>online</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions</b> can aggravate project managers’ role constraints and that project managers can use relational exchange competences to overcome these constraints. Overall, buying services through <b>online</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions</b> is quite different from buying products.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effects of online reverse auctions (ORAs) in {{business}} markets using an illustrative case study of the introduction of this tool in relationships involving a car assembler and three of its suppliers.

In practice, it as difficult to codify all the necessary information required to generate specifications as it is to separate the process of formulating solutions from their implementation. Whereas relational contexts tolerate these ambiguities and grey zones, tools such as ORAs require precise specifications and clear distinctions between the objects to be transacted and phases of the transaction. Our empirical data shows how actors work around these difficulties and cope with the constraints imposed by ORAs.

40|$|Reverse auction bidding is {{an online}} auction system. A purchaser's primary {{objective}} in using a reverse auction is {{to obtain the}} lowest possible bid {{for goods and services}} on a construction project. With this type of bidding, it is normal that the purchaser will only consider price, instead of a bidders' work history and experience. As a reverse auction is an online service, the common misperception is that a purchaser can reach a broader market to obtain the lowest possible price. It is a controversial bidding system. No previous research has been undertaken by the Texas A&M University Reverse Auction Bidding study group into potential owner interference with the bidding system for a reverse auction. Six bidders were asked to participate in the Reverse Auction Bidding process for a series of construction projects in Houston. Each participant was also asked to complete a Keirsey Temperament Sorter Test type I and II to determine each participant's personality. After the tests, the six participants competed in an <b>online</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>auction</b> bidding game. The primary objective of this research is to analyze the impact of an owner's interference in a reverse auction bidding scenario. In this test, one of the six bidders acted as the owner's surrogate to interfere with an ethical process and reduce the owner's costs. The other five bidders were unaware of the surrogate's role in the bidding. The primary directive given to the surrogate bidder was to drive down the cost of the projects. The results for the research study show that the owner's surrogate can affect the bidding process.

40|$|Online {{markets have}} {{dramatically}} decreased costs of search and communication for buyers. By contrast, costs of evaluating purchasing alternatives have become critical {{due to an}} overwhelming range of available options. When high, evaluation costs can offset potential gains from transactions and cause inefficiencies, e. g. by forcing buyers to abandon transactions without allocating contracts. While most previous studies treat evaluation costs as an exoge-nous factor, this study considers them endogenous. We identify several tactics (search, request for proposal preparation, budget announcement, bid filtering, and negotiation) that buyers at online markets can use to reduce their evaluation costs and hence influence project allocation. Using data from nearly 10 thousand transactions at a leading online marketplace for IT services, we show that buyers who use these tactics {{are more likely to}} allocate their project to a winner than buyers not using these tactics. Buyer experience also has a positive effect on allocation and, in addition, moderates the effectiveness of some of the tactics. As experience grows, budget announcement be-comes more effective in coping with evaluation costs and increases the likelihood of allocation, while the effectiveness of request for proposal preparation decreases.

40|$|This {{exposition}} summarises research {{published in}} several academic articles, {{in order to}} meet the requirements of PhD by publication. The focus of the work is on the role of electronic procurement in management of the purchasing function. From the late 1990 s a number of independent e-procurement mechanisms were launched which offered potential benefits such as increased order accuracy, transaction efficiency and greater integration between trading partners. At the outset of this programme of research, e-procurement was therefore an emerging phenomenon with little academic research and presented an opportunity to investigate a largely unexplored area. Edmondson and McManus (2007) suggest that for nascent, as opposed to mature areas of research, where few formal constructs or measures exist, an exploratory, qualitative approach is required. This research followed such an approach through the use of case studies, involving observation, participation and interviews with key organisational actors. Each paper makes use of several cases in order to compare and contrast results from different organisations and to draw conclusions from multi-case analysis. The published articles focus on the impact of core applications within e-procurement, including <b>online</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions,</b> electronic marketplaces, <b>online</b> catalogue sites, and buying systems covering the ‘requisition to pay’ cycle. The findings from the papers address a number of core themes in purchasing management. In considering buyer-supplier relationships, it was observed that such dyads are driven by traditional buyer negotiation factors such as segmentation, power and price and that use of eprocurement applications tended to enforce such traditional behaviours. In relation to the potential for integration, the study found that integration between firms was barely affected, as the concept of integration was neither an objective nor a business case driver for e-procurement adoption. This situation reflects the finding that procurement managers pursue functional targets rather than supply chain-level objectives. However, other significant effects from e-procurement adoption were noted such as the tendency by buyers to reduce supplier numbers and a move to re-engineer the procurement function in buying firms, through automating transactional processes. The research finds that e-procurement does not have a deterministic impact on purchasing management, and that it acts as an enabler to more effective management of the function though the way its different mechanisms are deployed. The exposition establishes that e-procurement is used in relation to supply conditions which are characterised by both ‘markets’ and ‘hierarchies’, but that it is the predefined purchasing strategy of the firm, rather than available technology solutions, which determines when markets and hierarchies are used. Additionally, an original model is introduced, focusing on developing an e-procurement policy which can support strategic purchasing goals. This model extrapolates findings from stages in the research, and marries together elements from various papers and frameworks therein, to produce some guidelines for adoption of this technology.

All too often, {{the use of}} <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions</b> {{has been}} {{characterized}} as simply a tactical tool for rapidly reducing Supplier pricing to break-even or unsupportable levels.

Many mobile SMS commerce solutions rely on a one-time purchase or one-time subscription; however, <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions</b> offer a high return for the mobile vendor as they require the consumer to make multiple transactions {{over a long period of}} time.|$|R

40|$|In {{the late}} 1990 ’s, online Business-to-Business (B 2 B) <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions</b> (E-RA’s) proliferated and were adopted {{in a wide}} variety of circumstances. The <b>reverse</b> <b>auction</b> format evolved to take {{advantage}} of Internet technology and <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions</b> have been identified by many large organisations as a tool to achieve substantial procurement savings. As companies adopt this technology it is important for them to understand the implications of this type of procurement. This paper adopts a case study approach to identify the issues for both buyers and sellers using this type of B 2 B application. It describes the conduct of multiple <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions</b> in a large Australian global company viewed through the eyes of the buyer undertaking a <b>reverse</b> <b>auction.</b> The main finding of the paper is the keen acceptance of the E-RA model and its ability to drive down costs across the procurement process...|$|R
