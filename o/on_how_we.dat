25|$|It's like St. Patrick's Day. I {{came out}} of respect for what my people are doing, not because I believe it will do any good. I thought it would do some good in the beginning. But when the march started to get all the {{official}} approval from Mastah Kennedy, Mastah Wagner, Mastah Spellman, and they started setting limits <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> had to march peacefully, I knew that the march {{was going to be a}} mockery, that they were giving us something again.|$|E

500|$|In January 2012, Kennedy {{announced}} he would form an exploratory committee {{to run in the}} newly redrawn 4th congressional district. Congressman Barney Frank, who had previously represented the district, had announced his retirement, leaving an open field for the seat. Kennedy explained, [...] "I will then begin {{to reach out to the}} people of the Fourth District in order to hear directly from them about the challenges they are facing and their ideas <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> can restore fairness to our system. I will make a final decision about entering the race in the weeks thereafter." ...|$|E
500|$|The tritium leak, {{combined}} with other disclosures about improper handling and disposal of hazardous waste, had caused Secretary of Energy Federico Peña to fire the lab's previous manager, Associated Universities, Inc. Upon starting as the laboratory's director, Marburger noted the increased importance of health and environmental concerns {{since the beginning of}} the Cold War, stating that [...] "getting the people at Brookhaven to understand that won't be simple, and there may be some disagreement <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> should do it, but that's my job." [...] Marburger set up a permanent community advisory council and met with local environmental groups to increase communication between them and the laboratory's management. By 2001, when Marburger left to join the Bush administration, local environmental groups credited him with having largely dissipated the distrust that had existed between the groups when he started.|$|E
500|$|The {{existence}} of the band itself caused a debate in the metal underground. For example, during the early 1990s, Bård Faust of Emperor brought up the subject when he discussed with Euronymous, guitarist/vocalist from the seminal black metal band Mayhem, in his zine Orcustus about the Norwegian scene. Faust asked: [...] "Don't you think that something is terribly wrong when it {{has gone so far}} that we have a Christian [...] "death metal" [...] band here (Crush Evil)? Any advice <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> should kill them?" [...] Euronymous replied to this: [...] "It's bad enough to have a couple of society bands, but a Christian band is too much. But don't worry, we have plans. They will not continue for a very long time." [...] However, the band persevered despite these threats. Antestor was never forced to split apart, and in an almost ironic twist of fate, Jan Axel Blomberg (better known as Hellhammer, the drummer for Mayhem) was Antestor's session drummer on their latest two releases.|$|E

500|$|The Ludys {{argue that}} one's love {{life should be}} both guided by and {{subordinate}} to one's relationship with God. They suggest that, [...] "if God's plan and purpose for you is marriage, then the person you will one day marry... is alive and wandering the earth" [...] and that this knowledge should encourage people to act {{in such a way}} that their future spouses would be pleased. The Ludys contest the definition of [...] "true love" [...] as an emotion; instead, they define [...] "true love" [...] as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that [...] "there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs. The mystery is that when we spend our life focused on our own needs, we are never satisfied... but when we pour out our life and focus <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> can serve others... our deepest needs are met as well!" ...|$|E
500|$|The album Margerine Eclipse {{followed}} in 2004 with generally positive reviews, and peaked at number 174 on the US Billboard 200. The track [...] "Feel and Triple" [...] {{was written in}} tribute to Hansen; [...] according to Sadier [...] "I was reflecting on my years with her... reflecting <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> sometimes {{found it hard to}} express the love we had for one another." [...] Sadier continued, [...] "Our dedication to her on the album [...] says, 'We will love you till the end', meaning of our lives. I'm not religious, but I feel Mary's energy is still around somewhere. It didn't just disappear." [...] The Observers Molloy Woodcraft awarded the album four out of five stars, and described Sadier's vocal performance as [...] "life- and love-affirming", and the record as a whole as [...] "Complex and catchy, bold and beatific." [...] Kelefa Sanneh argued in Rolling Stone that Margerine Eclipse was [...] "full of familiar noises and aimless melodies". Margerine Eclipse was Stereolab's last record to be released on American label Elektra Records, which shut down that same year. Future material would be released on Too Pure, the same label which had released some of the band's earliest material.|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} interview, Rihanna {{explained}} why {{she liked to}} collaborate with Minaj, saying [...] "She has a great buzz {{and she has a}} 'thing' to her. She is a star and that's why people love her. She's also really entertaining with her visual as well as her lyrics, and she has a great melody." [...] The singer continued to reveal how she was impressed with Minaj's songwriting abilities, saying [...] "I'm really amazed that she can write like that. [...] not only raps but she can write songs too... It was really easy actually. We were going back and forth with the texts <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> were going to get to do it because we were in two different places and had two opposite schedules." [...] In an interview with DJ Semtex for BBC Radio, Minaj explained how the concept for her rap verse developed, revealing [...] "I just wanted to be crazy, I wrote that track in bed actually. I had an off day, they sent me a record and said they needed it back in 24 hours and I wrote." [...] With regard to the original, [...] "It's Raining Men", Minaj stated that she wanted to make [...] "Raining Men" [...] "more melodic and crazy." [...] "Raining Men" [...] was sent for urban radio adds as the third single from Loud on December 7, 2010. On January 25, 2011, the song was re-released for urban radio adds.|$|E

2500|$|Another English Franciscan, John Pecham (died 1292) {{built on}} the work of Bacon, Grosseteste, and a diverse range of earlier writers to produce what became the most widely used {{textbook}} on Optics of the Middle Ages, the Perspectiva communis.

2500|$|The American Ornithologists' Union Committee on Classification and Nomenclature {{has said}} {{it is not yet}} ready to list the American and Cuban as {{separate}} species.

[...] Before this study, the Cuban ivory-billed was thought to be descended from mainland woodpeckers, either introduced to Cuba by Native Americans or accidentals that flew to the island themselves.|$|E

Firstly it sets out robust proposals <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> are to reach our challenging target of recovering £250 million of the proceeds of crime by 2009-10. The Plan goes on to outline, for consultation, policy proposals for taking things further, including some radical ideas to move towards the Government's long term vision of detecting up to £1 billion of criminal assets.|$|E
