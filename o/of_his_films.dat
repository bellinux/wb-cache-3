5|$|Miyazaki's {{works are}} {{characterized}} by the recurrence of themes such as humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the wholesomeness of natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and craftsmanship, {{and the difficulty of}} maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world. The protagonists <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>films</b> are often strong girls or young women, and several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>films</b> present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly praised and awarded; he was named a Person of Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in November 2012, and received the Academy Honorary Award for his impact on animation and cinema in November 2014. In 2002, American film critic Roger Ebert suggested that Miyazaki may be the best animation filmmaker in history, praising the depth and artistry <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>films.</b>|$|E
5|$|Szabó {{emphasizes}} iconography in his films, {{insofar as}} {{he tends to}} invest certain objects and places with symbolic meaning. Tram cars play this role in many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>films,</b> and one becomes the central image in Budapest Tales. Budapest itself {{plays an important role}} in many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>films,</b> including scenes of the Danube and of buildings Szabó lived in when he was a child.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, {{he began a}} {{business}} partnership with producer Martine Marignac, who produced all his subsequent films. Rivette's output increased from then on, with films such as Gang of Four and La Belle Noiseuse receiving international praise. He continued making films until 2009, retiring after the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease made the production of 36 vues du pic Saint-Loup too {{difficult for him to}} continue. Many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>films</b> are known for their long running time, including the 760-minute Out 1. Almost always at the insistence of the distributors, Rivette edited shorter versions of five <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>films</b> and considered some of them to be entirely new films with different meanings.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{most of his}} contemporaries, Mani Ratnam did not assist {{anybody in}} film-making prior to {{entering}} the industry. He is credited with revolutionizing the Tamil film industry and is referred for bringing new dimension to the South Asian cinema. A majority <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>films</b> are characterized by a string of socio-political themes. Because of his idea of combining art and commercial elements, most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>films</b> garnered both critical acclaim and commercial success. Nayagan, Bombay and Iruvar were inspired from real-life incidents, while Thalapathi and Raavan were based on Indian epics.|$|E

5|$|Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak of the University of Maryland {{discusses}} how {{one aspect}} of Kiarostami's cinematic style {{is that he is}} able to capture essences of Persian poetry and create poetic imagery within the landscape <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>films.</b> In Where Is the Friend's Home? and The Wind Will Carry Us, classical Persian poetry is directly quoted in the film, highlighting the artistic link and intimate connection between them. This in turn reflects on the connection between the past and present, between continuity and change.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Hitchcock's cameo is a {{signature}} occurrence in most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>films.</b> In Psycho, {{he can be}} seen through a window—wearing a Stetson hat—standing outside Marion Crane's office. Wardrobe mistress Rita Riggs has said that Hitchcock chose this scene for his cameo {{so that he could}} be in a scene with his daughter (who played one of Marion's colleagues). Others have suggested that he chose this early appearance in the film in order to avoid distracting the audience.|$|E
5|$|Aronofsky {{is known}} for his {{environmental}} activism. A number <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>films,</b> notably Noah and mother!, can be read as environmental parables.

5|$|Film critic Ben Zipper {{believes}} that Kiarostami’s {{work as a}} landscape artist {{is evident in the}} composition of distant shots of the dry hills throughout a number <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>films.</b> He points out that Kiarostami’s use of rural locations and remote settings is reminiscent of Sohrab Sepehri’s attention to landscape as represented in his poems such as Golestaneh, in which the poet treats the rural environment realistically and imbues it with a poetic aura.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1951, the Berlin International Film Festival, {{also called}} the Berlinale, is an annual film festival held in Berlin, Germany.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Kim's work {{began to be}} rediscovered by South Korean cult film fans who {{discussed}} his films through the Internet and exchanged hard-to-find copies by videotape. Noticing this growing domestic Kim Ki-young cult, the Dongsung Cinematheque, an art-house theater in Seoul, programmed a retrospective showing of Kim's films. With his profile again high in Korean film society, Kim's work began to attract international attention. Five <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>films</b> were screened at the Tokyo International Film Festival in 1996. When Kim Ki-young's career was highlighted at the second Pusan International Film Festival in 1997, his work found enthusiastic new audiences in the international film community. The strongly positive reception of Kim's work by international audiences surprised the festival organizers, who immediately began receiving requests for overseas retrospectives of Kim's career. With this renewed interest, Kim began work on a comeback film to be titled Diabolical Woman. The Berlin International Film Festival invited him to attend a showing <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>films</b> in 1998. Before Kim started work on the film or attended the festival, {{he and his wife}} were killed in a house fire caused by an electrical short circuit on February 5, 1998.|$|E
5|$|In the late-1930s, Clouzot {{went to a}} cabaret show {{featuring}} entertainers Mistinguett and Suzy Delair at the Deus Anes Cabaret. Clouzot {{waited for}} Delair at the stage door and after meeting her, the two became a romantic couple for the next 12 years. Clouzot had Delair star in two <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>films,</b> The Murderer Lives at Number 21 and Quai des Orfèvres. Delair eventually left Clouzot after working with him on Quai des Orfèvres.|$|E
5|$|Kiarostami's cinema {{offers a}} {{different}} definition of film. According to film professors such as Jamsheed Akrami, {{unlike many other}} contemporary filmmakers Kiarostami has consistently attempted to redefine film by forcing the audience's increased involvement. In recent years he has also progressively trimmed down the size <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>films,</b> which Akrami believes reduces the film making experience from a collective endeavor to a purer, more basic form of artistic expression.|$|E
