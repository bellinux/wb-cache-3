2500|$|Over the 20th century, trusts {{came to be}} {{used for}} {{multiple}} purposes beyond the classical role of parcelling out wealthy families' estates, wills, or charities. First, as more working-class people became more affluent, they began to be able to save for retirement through occupational pensions. After the Old Age Pensions Act 1908, everyone who worked and paid National Insurance would probably have access to the minimal state pension, but if people wanted to maintain their living standards, they would need more. Occupational pensions would typically be constituted through a trust deed, after being bargained for by a trade union under a collective agreement. After World War Two, the number of people with occupational pensions rose further, and gradually regulation was introduced to ensure that people's [...] "pension promise" [...] was protected. The settlor would usually be the employer and employee jointly, and the savings would be transferred to a trustee {{for the benefit of the}} employee. Most regulation, especially after the Robert Maxwell scandals and the Goode Report, was directed at ensuring that the employer cannot dominate, or abuse its position through undue influence over the trustee or the trust fund. The second main use of the trust came to be in <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>investments,</b> though not necessarily for retirement. The unit trust, since their launch in 1931, became a popular vehicle for holding [...] "units" [...] in a fund that would invest in various assets, such as company shares, gilts or government bonds or corporate bonds. One person investing alone might not have much money to spread the risk of his or her investments, and so the unit trust offered an attractive way to pool many investors wealth, and share the profits (or losses). Nowadays, unit trusts have been mostly superseded by Open-ended investment companies, which do much the same thing, but are companies selling shares, rather than trusts. Nevertheless, trusts are widely used, and notorious in offshore trusts in [...] "tax havens", where people hire an accountant or lawyer to make an argument that shifting assets in some new way will avoid tax. The third main contemporary use of the trust has been in the family home, though not as an expressly declared trust. As gender inequality began to narrow, both partners to a marriage would often be contributing money, or work, to pay the mortgage, make their home, or raise children together. A number of members of the judiciary became active from the late 1960s in declaring that even if one partner was not on the legal title deeds, she or he would still have an equitable property interest in the home under a [...] "resulting trust" [...] or (more normally today) a [...] "constructive trust". In essence the courts would acknowledge the existence of a property right, without the trust being expressly declared. Some courts said it reflected an implicit common intention, while others said the use of the trust reflected the need to do justice. In this way, trusts continued to fulfill their historical function of mitigating strict legal rules in the interests of equity.|$|E

25|$|Since {{hedge funds}} are private {{entities}} and have few public disclosure requirements, this is sometimes {{perceived as a}} lack of transparency. Another common perception of hedge funds is that their managers are not subject to as much regulatory oversight and/or registration requirements as <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>investment</b> managers, and more prone to manager-specific idiosyncratic risks such as style drifts, faulty operations, or fraud. New regulations introduced in the US and the EU as of 2010 require hedge fund managers to report more information, leading to greater transparency. In addition, investors, particularly institutional investors, are encouraging further developments in hedge fund risk management, both through internal practices and external regulatory requirements. The increasing influence of institutional investors has led to greater transparency: hedge funds increasingly provide information to investors including valuation methodology, positions and leverage exposure.|$|R

A {{sponsorship}} {{is seen as}} {{the marketing}} communication activity whereby an IOrganization contractually makes a <b>financial</b> or material <b>investment</b> to an individual, activity or broadcast in order to achieve pre-determined objectives for the organization amongst the members of the organization's target market. Sponsorship of events, sport and broadcasts has increased in prominence in the past ten years, largely due to the increasing amounts of money which are being invested in this aspect of marketing communication. The growth in sponsorship investment reflects growth of between 25 %- 30 % per annum, which is larger than that found in other marketing disciplines., Approximately {{the same amount of money}} is spent on radio advertising in this country annually as invested in sponsorships, indicating the relative importance and widespread use of sponsorship by organizations in South Africa. Various sponsorship objectives have been identified in the literature such as corporate objectives, product obje~tives, sales objectives as well as the objectives of media exposure, publicity and communication: A sponsorship is a form of investment, it needs to be evaluated like any <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>investment.</b> The sponsorship investment must be evaluated in terms of its required performance. The sponsorship is required to yield a commercial benefit for the sponsoring organization, and evaluating the benefit is important to its continued use by the organization. Methods which can be used to evaluate a sponsorship can be divided into four broad categories, namely advertising-based methods, sales-based methods, sponsorship-specific methods and other methods. Which of the above methods ought to be used to evaluate a sponsorship depends on the objectives which the organization sets for the specific sponsorship.

50|$|Venture capital as the {{business}} of investing in new or young companies with innovative ideas emerged as a prominent branch of Entrepreneurial finance {{in the beginning of}} the 20th century. Wealthy families such as the Vanderbilt family, the Rockefeller family and the Bessemer family began private investing in private companies. One of the first venture capital firms, J.H. Whitney & Company, was founded in 1946 and is still in business today. The formation of the American Research and Development Foundation (ARDC) by General Georges F. Doriot institutionalized venture capital after the Second World War. In 1958, the Small Business Investment Companies (SBIC) license enabled finance companies to leverage federal US funds to lend to growing companies. Further regulatory changes in the USA -namely the reduction of capital gains tax and the ERISA pension reforms- boosted venture capital in the 1970s. During the 1980s and 1990s, the venture capital industry grew in importance and experienced high volatility in returns.

The portfolio under investigation yielded a small but positive real return. Still, stock market returns are higher than the returns in the art market. Furthermore, we find a rather high correlation between stock returns and art market returns. However, the returns to investing in paintings are negatively correlated with the returns on traditional investment alternatives in a developing country context, such as foreign exchange, gold, and bank deposits. Hence, there might exist some room for portfolio diversification. Nevertheless, the time horizon of the investments is a key factor especially in portfolios involving art objects. ...|$|E

The New South Wales (NSW) Local Government Councils was one such group of organisations impacted by the decline in value of these types of investments. At the end of the 2006 - 2007 financial year local councils in New South Wales had invested $ 590 million dollars in structured financial products such as collateralised debt obligations (CDO). By the end of January 2008, six months later, the market value of these investments dropped $ 200 million (34 %) to $ 390 million. In response to the decreasing value of the local council investments the NSW State Government commissioned a review of the financial exposures of NSW local councils in structured financial products. The review found that while acting within the parameters of the Local Government Act (1993), local councils had pursued high return high risk investment strategies. This paper reviews and evaluates financial investment exposures of the local councils in NSW and the resulting mix (unqualified/qualified) independent audit opinions issued on their general purpose financial reports.

First, it shows how the Euro Health Consumer Index - which is comprised from 6 indicators - {{can be used as}} a single-outcome latent variable. This feature expands the possibilities of incorporating EHCI in future research. Secondly, this paper also serves as an example of the use of Partial Least Squares (PLS) and its characteristics. The analytical technique is PLS. The empirical analysis uses a set of 22 European countries (20 from European Union plus Norway and Switzerland) and departs from a model that relates four latent constructs, one representing National Performance (the aggregated measure of the EHCI) and the <b>others</b> representing <b>financial</b> <b>investment</b> in health care and human and physical resources. The final estimates provide very interesting results. The main result, or a judgment from the point of view of political implications of this research, is that a successful health care system needs mainly <b>financial</b> <b>investment.</b> Secondly, it also benefits - to a lesser extent - from physical capabilities.

40|$|This is a {{paper from}} AURISA â 95 Conference 1995. It is {{pointed out that}} there are two {{components}} in the GIS investment by the State Government of Victoria; infrastructure investment and business system investment. Owing to inadequate funding up-front, so far, the emphasis of GIS development in Victoria is still on establishing the infrastructure. Development of business systems is lagging behind. The nature of GIS infrastructure investment is such that it relies on benefits derived from business systems developed from it to substantiate it. If Victoria's GIS investment is evaluated within a relatively short time frame, say four to five years from now, the infrastructure may not be mature enough. There may not be sufficient business systems implemented then to justify the GIS investment, the main bulk of which has been in infrastructure. It is recommended that while business systems can be evaluated in a short time frame like <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>investments,</b> GIS infrastructure should be assessed {{at the end of the}} actual life cycle of the project when the business systems planned have been implemented. There are three main management implications. First, State Departments should be assessed of their readiness to implement GIS. Second, there should be an agreed program of development and monitoring for both GIS infrastructure and business systems. Third, there should be an agreed mechanism by which, the costs and benefits of developing the GIS infrastructures and business systems can be shared in an equitable manner among the State Government and its Departments. 20 - 24 November 1995 Open Acces...|$|E

All {{of the variables}} used in this article and their definitions {{can be found in}} Appendix TableÂ  8. Our approach is to group these expenditures into two categories, which we label as âordinary consumptionâ and âasset accumulation.â We define asset accumulation in a broad sense to include spending on the accumulation of human capital (education and health), physical assets (durable assets plus businesses and micro-enterprises plus real estate assets), and financial capital (the sum of bank deposits, loans to others, stocks, bonds, and <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> market <b>investment</b> instruments). Our definition of âasset accumulationâ is intended to get at saving. While this approach to measuring saving may appear unusual, in a country like Mexico, much of the population has limited avenues for accumulating financial assets owing to their unbanked status, mistrust of financial institutions and relative shallowness of the financial system. This is especially true among rural households, a population of primary interest in the analysis of remittances as they receive most of Mexicoâs remittance inflows. Therefore, the purchase of durable assets 4, spending on human capital, and improvements in existing housing structures can account for much of the householdâs asset accumulation 5.|$|R
