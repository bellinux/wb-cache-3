5|$|Since {{the end of}} the Civil War, {{stories of}} the Confederate gold and its vast wealth have been told and retold. One <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>stories</b> {{involves}} Alexander. He helped organize search parties in Lincoln and Wilkes counties. Alexander and bank officials soon located some of the gold through Alexander's neighbors in Wilkes county and persuaded them that the money belonged to wives and children of Confederate veterans. With Alexander's help, bank officials eventually recovered some $111,000 of the stolen money. Former Confederate cabinet official Robert Toombs also turned over $5,000 that, intentionally or accidentally, had been thrown into his yard in Washington.|$|E
5|$|South Pacific is {{a musical}} {{composed}} by Richard Rodgers, with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II and book by Hammerstein and Joshua Logan. The work premiered in 1949 on Broadway {{and was an}} immediate hit, running for 1,925 performances. The plot of the musical is based on James A. Michener's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1947 book Tales of the South Pacific and combines elements of several <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>stories.</b> Rodgers and Hammerstein believed they could write a musical based on Michener's work that would be financially successful and, at the same time, would send a strong progressive message on racism.|$|E

500|$|... "Amy's Choice" [...] {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Gavin Fuller, writing for The Daily Telegraph, was {{positive about the}} episode, calling it [...] "probably the strongest all-round script we've had this year, chock full of good lines". He added, [...] "The concept of aliens inhabiting elderly people and turning them psychotic was wittily realised, particularly the bizarre sight of them laying siege to Amy and Rory's cottage with household and gardening implements". He concluded that it [...] "was one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>stories</b> that you would only find in Doctor Who, and shows once again that the series can provide genuine thought-provoking, interesting drama alongside its thrills and spills".|$|E
500|$|Hearing of its release, {{neighbors of}} Geisel's in Springfield were at first worried the book {{would be an}} exposé of the people there. [...] Sales were lackluster, but early reviews were glowing. [...] Clifton Fadiman wrote a one-sentence review in The New Yorker, which Geisel could still quote {{near the end of}} his life: [...] "They say it's for children, but better get a copy for {{yourself}} and marvel at the good Dr. Seuss' impossible pictures and the moral tale of the little boy who exaggerated not wisely but too well." [...] The New York Times wrote, [...] "Highly original and entertaining, Dr Seuss' picture book partakes of the better qualities of those peculiarly America institutions, the funny papers and the tall tale. It is a masterly interpretation of the mind of a child in the act of creating one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>stories</b> with which children often amuse themselves and bolster up their self-respect." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{major theme}} running {{throughout}} McNeile's works is the First World War. Between 1915 and 1918 he had five collections {{of short stories}} published about the war, while his post-war fiction {{can be seen as}} an extension <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>stories,</b> as [...] "both treat the war as a trial with manhood at stake". His war stories were considered by contemporary audiences as anti-sentimental, realistic depictions of the trenches, and as a [...] "celebration of the qualities of the Old Contemptibles". McNeile's view, as expressed through his writing, was that war was a purposeful activity for the nation and for individuals, even if that purpose was later wasted: a [...] "valuable chance at national renewal that had been squandered". The positive effects of war on the individual were outlined by McNeile in The Making of an Officer, his series of articles in The Times, in which he wrote about [...] "the qualities of leadership and selflessness essential to 'inspire' subalterns", a theme he returned to in his war stories—particularly The Lieutenant and Others and Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E—and then afterwards in his fictional stories, notably the Bulldog Drummond works.|$|E

2500|$|The Bringing Them Home report {{provided}} extensive {{details about}} the removal programs and their effects. Sir Ronald Wilson, former President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission and a Commissioner on the Inquiry, stated that [...] "when {{it comes to the}} credibility <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>stories,</b> there is ample credibility, not from the cross-examination of the children themselves, but from the governments whose laws, practices and policies enabled these forced removals to take place. We had the support of every State government; they came to the Inquiry, came with lever-arch files setting out the laws from the earliest days right up {{to the end of the}} assimilation policy, that is up to the 1970s and more importantly, senior government offices attended. In every case, these senior officers acknowledged that there was a lot of cruelty in the application of those laws and policies." ...|$|E

6000|$|About that hermitage hung one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>stories</b> {{so common}} in the Middle Ages, in which the hermit appears as the {{protector}} of the hunted wild beast; a story, too, which was probably authentic, as the curious custom which was said to perpetuate its memory lasted at least till the year 1753.
