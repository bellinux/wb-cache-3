40|$|Recently, musicologists Linda Austern and Suzanne Cusick have {{examined}} the socio-cultural implications of gender issues in Renaissance music. Drawing on Cusick's research on gender-based binary <b>oppositions</b> <b>in</b> Italy and Austern's studies of women and music in England, I propose a related set of gender binary <b>oppositions</b> <b>in</b> English society. I apply these <b>oppositions</b> <b>in</b> detail to two specific works from the Elizabethan madrigal and lute song repertoire, then examine the remaining pieces from these collections {{as a whole and}} find that an overlap of four particular oppositions better captures the contradictory nature of the music. Examining pieces that fall into each category, I observe how the composer manipulates each to complicate the piece's gender character. I conclude that while binary oppositions grasp the artistic and political trends of an era, {{a closer look at the}} tensions at work between them provides a more nuanced view of the music's gender character...|$|R
