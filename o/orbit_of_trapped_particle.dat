In the finite-beta configuration, even <b>orbits</b> <b>of</b> deeply <b>trapped</b> <b>particles</b> deviate significantly from magnetic flux surfaces. Thus, neoclassical ripple transport coefficients in the finite-beta configuration are several {{times larger than}} those in the vacuum configuration under the same condition of temperatures and radial electric fields. When the plasma temperature is several keV, a bifurcation of the electric fields appears under the ambipolarity condition, and sufficient large radial electric fields can be generated.

5000|$|From 1903, when Størmer first {{observed}} Kristian Birkeland's experimental {{attempts to}} explain the aurora borealis, he was fascinated by aurorae and related phenomena. His first work on the subject attempted to model mathematically the paths taken by charged particles perturbed by {{the influence of a}} magnetized sphere, and Størmer eventually published over 48 papers on the motion of charged particles. By modeling the problem using differential equations and polar coordinates, Størmer was able to show that the radius of curvature of any particle's path is proportional to the square of its distance from the sphere's center. To solve the resulting differential equations numerically, he used Verlet integration, which is therefore also known as Störmer's method. Ernst Brüche and Willard Harrison Bennett verified experimentally Størmer's predicted particle motions; Bennett called his experimental apparatus [...] "Störmertron" [...] in honor of Størmer. Størmer's calculations showed that small variations in the trajectories of particles approaching the earth would be magnified by the effects of the Earth's magnetic field, explaining the convoluted shapes of aurorae. Størmer also considered the possibility that <b>particles</b> might be <b>trapped</b> within the magnetic field, and worked out the <b>orbits</b> <b>of</b> these <b>trapped</b> <b>particles,</b> a prediction that was borne out after his death by the 1958 discovery of the Van Allen radiation belt.|$|R
40|$|The time-of-flight-type neutral {{particle}} analyzer has an ability of horizontal scanning from 40 to 100 ° of the pitch angle. The {{information from the}} spatially resolved energy spectrum gives not only the ion temperature but also the information of the particle confinement and the electric field in plasmas. We have been studying the energy distributions at various magnetic configurations in the neutral beam injection (NBI) plasma. The spatially resolved energy spectra can be observed during long discharges of the NBI plasma by continuous scanning of the {{neutral particle}} analyzer. The shape of spectra is almost similar from 44 ° to 53 °. However, the spectra from 55 ° are strongly varied. They reflect the injection pitch angle of the beam. The pitch angle scanning experiment during the long discharge of NBI plasma has also been made under the reversal of the magnetic field direction. NBI 2 becomes counter injected with the reversal. We can easily observe the difference between co- and counter injections of NBI. During the electron cyclotron heating in the low-density plasma {{for the formation of}} the internal thermal barrier, large neutral particle increase or decease can be observed. The degree of the increase/decrease depends on the energy and the density.
