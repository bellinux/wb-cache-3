25|$|The Wingo quarter farm {{dates from}} 1790-1812 at Poplar Forest and was {{operational}} when Jefferson owned Poplar Forest; {{he gave the}} land on which it was located to Martha and Thomas Mann Randolph as a wedding present. Jefferson's surviving notes tell us that three carpenters were able to construct a slave cabin in three days and that the slaves most often lived next to their field or shop work sites. Documentary {{evidence suggests that the}} slave housing structures at Poplar Forest were made of logs and that each house had two rooms that each measured 12.5 x 15 feet; this is corroborated by archaeological evidence suggesting that the slave structures contained root cellars designed by the occupants, which were used to store clothing, tools, and iron hardware. Archaeologists used soil stains to discover storage pits, burned tree roots, and postoles; this analysis also yielded fragments <b>of</b> <b>glass,</b> <b>ceramics,</b> and iron which were discovered to have been parts of plates, bottles, and cooking pots. One other structure discovered is believed to have functioned as a smokehouse as well as a residence, while a third {{is believed to have been}} built later than the other two, and used primarily as housing. Soil analysis also suggests that there were fences in the slave quarters.|$|E
500|$|The archaeological digs and {{investigation}} {{at the site}} were led by Floyd Mansberger of Fever River Research, {{in consultation with the}} Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, during the summer of 1995. The first portion of the investigation was an initial walkover of the site, which yielded some pre-Civil War artifacts. Subsequently, the research team [...] "lightly disked" [...] the site to perform a [...] "controlled surface collection." [...] The surface collection yielded a wide range of artifacts including different types <b>of</b> <b>glass,</b> <b>ceramics,</b> personal items, and small amounts of brick and stone structural materials. The items retrieved during the collection strongly suggested that occupation of the Apple River Fort site occurred during the early 19th century, probably not extending beyond 1860, and was short-term. The archeology at the site uncovered the original footprint of the fort, a smaller than estimated 50foot(15m) by 70foot(21m) area, and made significant contributions {{to the understanding of the}} nature of the early Apple River settlement.|$|E

The dielectric properties <b>of</b> these <b>glass</b> <b>ceramics</b> are improved, while the transparency value dropped with an increase in the heat treatment temperature. The maximum dielectric constant obtained for these samples was 474 with a low loss (tanδ) of 0.02 from the glass-ceramic sample heat treated at 550 °C, however, this sample also had the lowest transparency. The optimum values of the dielectric properties in this work promise a bright future for this KNN glass ceramic in electro-optical applications.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we present a}} study <b>of</b> porous <b>glass</b> <b>ceramics</b> towards bacteria-immobilization {{applications}} for water filtration. Sol-gel synthesized glass samples were processed into Fe 2 O 3 -CaO-SiO 2 porous <b>glass</b> <b>ceramics</b> by introducing a pore forming agent. The crystal phase composition, morphology, and pore structure of the ceramics were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), N 2 adsorption-desorption measurements, and mercury intrusion porosimetry. By varying the pore forming agent and process conditions, varied pore size distributions are produced. The volume fraction of macropores is overall large while the volume fraction of meso-pores and micropores is overall comparably small. All samples display good biocompatability and compressive strength, making them suitable for bacteria immobilization. The macropore sizes were determined primarily {{by the size of}} pore forming agent, enabling control. The results provide a basis for optimizing the preparation <b>of</b> porous <b>glass</b> <b>ceramics</b> for bacteria immobilization. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R
