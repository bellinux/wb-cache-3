500|$|Eventually, {{the band}} left their {{independent}} record label Lookout! Records on friendly terms, and signed to Reprise. Signing {{to a major}} label caused many of the band's original fans from the independent music club 924 Gilman Street to regard Green Day as sell-outs. The club has banned Green Day from entering since the major label signing. Reflecting back on the period, lead vocalist Billie Joe Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, [...] "I couldn't {{go back to the}} punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure [...] The only thing I could do was get <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>bike</b> and go forward." ...|$|E

Ramsbottom added, [...] "Tom {{took a lot of}} chances. He took a lot of it [...] I remember him taking a course of strychnine to build up to some big event. He showed me the box, and had to take one every few days." [...] although he implied that other competitors were involved. Lewis recalled Simpson acquiring a small box at their hotel. Simpson explained to him: [...] "That's my year's supply of Micky Finns'. That lot cost me £800." ...|$|E
500|$|Kerplunks {{underground}} success led to {{a number}} of major record labels being interested in signing Green Day, and the band eventually left Lookout! and signed to Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo [...] "was the only person we could really talk to and connect with". Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, [...] "I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ...

His mother, Belle (1910–2007), was an elementary school teacher. In 1945, {{his family moved to}} the Kew Gardens Hills section of Flushing, Queens, in New York City. The musician Donald Fagen has described Simon's childhood as that of [...] "a certain kind of New York Jew, almost a stereotype, really, to whom music and baseball are very important. I {{think it has to do}} with the parents. The parents are either immigrants or first-generation Americans who felt like outsiders, and assimilation was the key thought—they gravitated to black music and baseball looking for an alternative culture." [...] Simon, upon hearing Fagen's description, said it [...] "isn't far from the truth." [...] Simon says about his childhood, [...] "I was a ballplayer.

This is more than supposition as I know of other NUJ members on the database." [...] The following year, Thomas and five journalists and photographers who had also been under surveillance by the London Metropolitan Police Service's National Domestic Extremism and Disorder Intelligence Unit (NDEDIU) began legal action against the force.
