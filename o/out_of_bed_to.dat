5|$|The Canadiens' team doctor, Dr. J.A. Hector Forgues, visited Morenz in late February and {{determined}} that he had suffered a nervous breakdown. To help Morenz, Dr. Forgues banned all visitors to his room, except for family and Canadiens officials. Mary, Morenz's wife, and their oldest son, Howie Jr., visited on most days, and William Morenz, his father, travelled from Stratford {{during the first week}} of March and stayed through March 5. On March 8, Morenz began complaining of chest pains, which doctors attributed to a heart attack. Mary Morenz and Cecil Hart were called to the hospital; around 11:30pm, Morenz tried to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> use the washroom but collapsed on the floor and died from a coronary embolism caused by blood clots from his damaged leg, minutes before his wife and coach arrived. He was 34.|$|E
25|$|Ling Tong {{respected}} and befriended {{members of the}} scholar-gentry. They admired him {{even though he was}} a military serviceman. Being receptive, he had a reputation for being accommodating towards men of talent. Even when he was busy with work, he always took time to receive visitors. He viewed righteousness and loyalty as important values and saw wealth as inferior. He was thus praised by Chen Shou as a guoshi. Once, Sun Quan's subjects recommended a famous talent, Sheng Xian, to him. Ling Tong was asleep when he heard that Sheng Xian had arrived to meet his lord. He immediately got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> receive Sheng Xian and held Sheng's hand while leading him to meet Sun Quan.|$|E
25|$|The {{stopover}} in {{the subcontinent}} {{meant that the}} Australians arrived home {{after the start of}} the 1956â€“57 season. No Tests were scheduled for the season. Burke started with a pair against Western Australia in his first match back, and then scored only two in the return match, although New South Wales won both games nonetheless. In the next match, he struck 220 of his state's 454 as they complete an innings win over South Australia. Over the Christmas period, Burke was a pivotal figure in the first tie in Sheffield Shield history. In the first innings, he carried his bat to make 132 of New South Wales' 281, giving them a 37-run lead over Victoria. In the second innings, the reigning champions had a target of 161, and Burke had to retire hurt with an injury. New South Wales collapsed to 7/70, forcing the ill captain Ian Craig to raise himself <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> bat. The score proceeded to 145, whereupon Burke returned upon the fall of Richie Benaud. Craig fell three runs later with the score at 148. Burke reached 8 and the scores were on 9/160 when he edged Ian Meckiff to wicket-keeper Len Maddocks, ending the match in a tie.|$|E
6000|$|Only {{one being}} in the house knew her Christian name, and that was Miss Aldclyffe. Cytherea stepped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed,</b> went <b>to</b> the door, and whispered back, 'Yes?' ...|$|R
60|$|Even as {{he spoke}} rose <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the {{distance}} a dreadful baying and howling. Battle leapt up <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> the window-hole. But Nod squatted shivering, his face hidden in his hands.|$|R

500|$|Shots {{were also}} {{recorded}} {{for the end}} of Alan's dream, when the character tumbles from The Swinging Star back to Earth to discover that he has only fallen <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed.</b> <b>To</b> achieve this [...] "spiralling shot", the team was carried by helicopter to an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet above an island off the coast of Portugal. The aircraft was then left to [...] "autogyro" [...] downwards as Perry recorded the view of the island looming up from below. Once again, however, the shot was declared inadequate and a model version was made at the AP Films Studios in Slough.|$|E
500|$|Lloyd's biographer Midge Gillies defines 1891 {{as being}} the year that she officially [...] "made it" [...] thanks to a {{catalogue}} of hit songs and major success in the halls and pantomime. When she appeared at the Oxford music hall in June, the audience cheered so loudly for her return that the following act could not be heard; The Era called her [...] "the favourite of the hour". During the summer months, she toured North England, including Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester. [...] At the last she stayed an extra six nights due to popular demand, which caused her to cancel a trip to Paris. [...] The 1892 pantomime was Little Bo Peep; or, Little Red Riding Hood and Hop O' My Thumb, in which she played Little Red Riding Hood. [...] The production was five hours long and culminated with the show's harlequinade. During one scene, her improvisational skills caused some scandal when she got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> pray, but instead reached for a chamber pot. The stunt angered Harris, who ordered her {{not to do it}} again or risk immediate dismissal. Max Beerbohm, who was in a later audience, said [...] "Isn't Marie Lloyd charming and sweet in the pantomime? [...] I think of little besides her." [...] On 12 January 1892, Lloyd and Courtenay brawled drunkenly in her Drury Lane dressing room after an evening's performance of Little Bo-Peep. [...] Courtenay pulled a decorative sword off the wall and threatened to cut her throat; she escaped from the room with minor bruises and reported the incident to the Bow Street police station. In early 1893, she travelled to Wolverhampton where she starred as Flossie in another unsuccessful piece called The A.B.C Girl; or, Flossie the Frivolous, which, according to MacQueen-Pope, [...] "ended the Queen of Comedy's career as an actress".|$|E
2500|$|... "Daytime," [...] said he, [...] "is nothing. You {{turn around}} and night comes on. Then there's nothing better than going {{straight}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> the dining room. And it's been pretty cold. I could scarcely get warm in a bathtub. But a hot drink is a wardrobe in itself. I've had strong drinks, and I'm flat-out drunk. The wine has gone to my head." ...|$|E
50|$|One way {{to think}} about basic ADLs is that they are the things many people do when they {{get up in the morning}} and get ready to go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the house: get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed,</b> go <b>to</b> the toilet, bathe, dress, groom, and eat.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{never saw}} me run as I {{did in this}} dream. Still it came {{creeping}} on to worry me.

5000|$|They were to [...] "retire" [...] {{and send}} to be exterminated those Jews {{who had become}} {{incapacitated}} and for whom the prognosis did not anticipate a return to work within four weeks.

2500|$|They {{recall the}} session as being {{accompanied}} by heavy marijuana use. [...] "We used to smoke dope from {{when we got}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> {{when we got back}} to bed," [...] recalls Porter, and Marr concurred: [...] "You're from Manchester, you smoke weed till it comes out of your ears."

2500|$|In January 2013, he {{was accused}} of {{dishonesty}} by Daybreak presenter Matt Barbet after claiming he had been excluded from a discussion about apprentices after turning up [...] "just 30 seconds late". Barbet said Hancock knew he was [...] "much more than a minute late" [...] and he should have arrived half an hour beforehand to prepare for the interview. His opponent expressed surprise that [...] "a minister whose Government berates 'shirkers' couldn't be bothered to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> defend his own policy".|$|E
2500|$|In 1974, David Bowie {{released}} the album Diamond Dogs. It {{is thought to}} be loosely based on the novel 1984. It includes the tracks [...] "We Are The Dead", [...] "1984" [...] and [...] "Big Brother". Before the album was made, Bowie's management (MainMan) had planned for Bowie and Tony Ingrassia (MainMan's creative consultant) to co-write and direct a musical production of Orwell's 1984, but apparently, Bowie loathed doing anything on assignment and showed his disinterest by not getting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> work on the project. Orwell's widow was appalled at the idea and refused to give MainMan the rights.|$|E
5000|$|In India, {{the culture}} {{has always said}} that when you wake up, you must roll to your right side and then get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed.</b> According <b>to</b> the Ayurveda, this can reduce the {{pressure}} on the cardiac system which constitutes of heart {{on the left side of}} the body.|$|R
60|$|Taylor blinked, {{rubbing his}} eyes. He jumped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> and hurried <b>to</b> the vidphone. A {{moment later he}} was put through to Moss.|$|R

2500|$|His last public {{statement}} was dictated {{to his daughter}} Helen in reply to receiving the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford's [...] "sorrow and affection": [...] "There is no expression of Christian sympathy that I value more {{than that of the}} ancient University of Oxford, the God-fearing and God-sustaining University of Oxford. I served her perhaps mistakenly, but {{to the best of my}} ability. [...] My most earnest prayers are hers to the uttermost and to the last". He left the house for the last time on 9 April. After 18 April he did not come down to the ground floor but still came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> lie on the sofa. [...] The Bishop of St Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane George Wilkinson recorded when he ministered to him along with Stephen Gladstone: Shall I ever forget the last Friday in Passion Week, when I gave him the last Holy Communion that I was allowed to administer to him? It was early in the morning. He was obliged to be in bed, and he was ordered to remain there, but the time had come for the confession of sin and the receiving of absolution. Out of his bed he came. Alone he knelt in the presence of his God till the absolution has been spoken, and the sacred elements received.|$|E
60|$|Then slumber {{interfered}} with his waking dreams, {{and he knew}} no more until daylight next morning, when he crept softly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> perform his customary task.|$|E
60|$|As {{soon as it}} was daylight, Happy Jack {{scrambled}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> {{look for}} Tommy Tit. He didn't have long to wait, for Tommy is quite as early a riser as Happy Jack.|$|E

60|$|Paul reluctantly got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> {{and went}} <b>to</b> {{look at the}} rather {{handsome}} legs of the other man that were covered with glistening, dark gold hair.|$|R
60|$|He stayed, however, at {{home all}} that day, and lay {{at home that}} night; {{early the next morning}} he gets <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed,</b> goes <b>to</b> a window which looked out towards the stable, and sounds his French horn, as he called it, which was his usual signal to call his men to go out a-hunting.|$|R
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "Why, certainly! You must {{account for}} the request in some way. It'll appeal to his sympathy, and put him into a good-humor if he happens {{to have to get}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> oblige you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Dick. And {{this was}} soon done, {{although they had}} to get a telegraph operator <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> do it. But as the man was well paid for his trouble, he did not mind this.|$|E
60|$|Sam laughed agin, {{short and}} nasty. Then he undressed 'imself very slow {{and got into}} bed. At twelve o'clock, just as Ginger was {{dropping}} off, he began to laugh agin, and 'e only stopped when 'e heard Ginger getting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> 'im.|$|E
60|$|He got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> {{and began}} <b>to</b> wash 'is face, and Ginger Dick, {{who was doing}} a bit o' thinking, gave a whisper to Sam and Peter Russet.|$|R
6000|$|Late at night, a step on {{the wooden}} porch, heard through her {{confusion}} of sleep; the storm-door opened; fumbling over the inner door-panels; the buzz of the electric bell. Kennicott muttering [...] "Gol darn it," [...] but patiently creeping <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed,</b> remembering <b>to</b> draw the covers up to keep her warm, feeling for slippers and bathrobe, clumping down-stairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is this a time," [...] said she, [...] "to {{keep people}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their <b>beds,</b> and <b>to</b> bring home company, {{to turn the}} house upside down?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They are rejoicing over my {{approaching}} end, {{knowing that}} I haven't changed my will. Mercenary creatures, don't exult too soon! there's time yet," [...] she muttered; and presently, {{unable to control}} her curiosity, she crept <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> listen and peep through the keyhole.|$|E
6000|$|... "Laddie practising cricket," [...] {{said the}} Lady, with the curious clairvoyance of motherhood. [...] "He gets <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> bowl. I do {{wish you would}} go up and speak seriously to him about it, for it takes quite an hour off his rest." ...|$|E
60|$|After repeating {{this many}} times, he became quite frightened, but, call as he would, neither man nor maid appeared. At last he jumped angrily <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> go {{in search of}} the culprits, but only found an empty house, and beds that had never been slept in.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hallo, Ned!" [...] cried Tom, {{suddenly}} leaping <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> {{and beginning}} <b>to</b> dress in haste; [...] "why, it's Christmas morning! I had almost forgot. A Merry Christmas to you, my boy!" ...|$|R
