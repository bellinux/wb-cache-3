5|$|Feeling a {{sense of}} home and belonging, Bruce formed a gang called Inner City Posse, which was {{composed}} of Joseph Utsler, Rudy Hill, other friends of Bruce, {{and a number of}} other connections he had made in Southwest Detroit. Bruce was jailed for ninety days in 1989–1990 for death threats, robbery, and violating probation; this experience convinced him to reduce his involvement in gang life. Bruce began his professional wrestling career after getting out <b>of</b> <b>jail,</b> and it was at his first show that he met Rob Van Dam and Sabu, two other first-timers with whom he became very good friends. During this time Bruce brought Utsler backstage with him, and all four became close friends.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAngiographic {{stenosis}} <b>of</b> a <b>jailed</b> side-branch ostium {{is usually}} observed after a single-stent crossover at coronary bifurcation lesions. However, the stenosis severity is typically overestimated {{due to the}} limited information obtained from two-dimensional morphology by angiography. We evaluated the actual stenosis <b>of</b> <b>jailed</b> side-branch ostium using three-dimensional (3 D) optical coherence tomography (OCT). MethodsUsing 3 D reconstructions of OCT data, we analyzed minimal lumen area (MLA) and eccentricity <b>of</b> the <b>jailed</b> side-branch ostium in 41 patients who were treated with single stent crossover at coronary bifurcation lesions and subsequently underwent serial OCT follow-up. ResultsThe MLA <b>of</b> <b>jailed</b> side-branch ostium calculated from quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) assuming a circular lumen markedly decreased after stent implantation (1. 73 ± 1. 22 mm 2 pre-intervention to 0. 84 ± 0. 91 mm 2 post-intervention, p< 0. 001). However, the MLA <b>of</b> <b>jailed</b> side-branch ostium measured at post-intervention by 3 D-OCT (2. 67 ± 1. 75 mm 2) was significantly larger than that measured by QCA (p< 0. 001). There were no statistically significant changes in MLA <b>of</b> <b>jailed</b> side-branch ostium based on 3 D-OCT measurements during the follow-up (2. 35 ± 1. 50 mm 2 at 3 – 6 months post-intervention; 2. 44 ± 1. 27 mm 2 at 1 – 2 years post-intervention, p= 0. 098). The shapes <b>of</b> the <b>jailed</b> side-branch ostium were nearly elliptical (mean eccentricity index: 2. 97 ± 1. 27 post-intervention; 2. 79 ± 1. 17 at 3 – 6 months post-intervention; 2. 59 ± 1. 02 at 1 – 2 years post-intervention). ConclusionsCompared to 3 D-OCT measurements, QCA measurements overestimated the jailed side-branch ostial stenosis after single stent crossover due to eccentric morphology from orthogonal projection in coronary angiography. Significant changes in the MLA <b>of</b> <b>jailed</b> side-branch ostium by 3 D-OCT were not observed during the follow-up...|$|R

5|$|The French {{authorities}} imprisoned Long {{and many}} of his supporters, who openly admitted their aim of overthrowing French authorities at the trial. During the 1916 Cochinchina uprisings against French rule, many of Long's supporters attempted to break him out <b>of</b> <b>jail.</b> The French easily repelled the attack on the jail, decimating Long's movement. Following the attempted breakout, Long and his key supporters were put to death.

She first had to fight the charges outstanding against her.Kennedy, p. 77.

No longer under the threat <b>of</b> <b>jail,</b> Sanger embarked on a successful cross-country speaking tour, which catapulted her into {{the leadership of the}} U.S. birth control movement. Other leading figures, such as William J. Robinson and Mary Dennett, chose to work in the background, or turned their attention to other causes. Later in 1916, Sanger traveled to Boston to lend her support to the Massachusetts Birth Control League and to jailed birth control activist Van Kleeck Allison.|$|E
