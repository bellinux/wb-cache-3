5|$|On 16 September 2005, Danish {{news service}} Ritzau {{published}} an article discussing the difficulty encountered by the writer Kåre Bluitgen, who was initially unable to find an illustrator prepared {{to work on his}} children's book The Qur'an and the life of the Prophet Muhammad (Danish:Koranen og profeten Muhammeds liv). Three artists declined Bluitgen's proposal <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> of reprisals.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} {{eventually}} canceled by the Air Force in January 1959, seemingly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> {{of a negative}} public reaction and the risk to the population should anything have gone wrong with the launch. Another factor, cited by project leader Leonard Reiffel, was the possible implications of the nuclear fallout for future lunar research projects and colonization.|$|E
5|$|A general {{mobilisation}} was {{not called}} until 3 April 1941, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> of offending Adolf Hitler. By {{the time the}} invasion commenced, the 1st Cavalry Division had only begun mobilisation. According to the Yugoslav historian Velimir Terzić, on 6 April the mobilisation of the division was proceeding slowly due to the low number of conscripts that reported for duty, and the poor provision of animals and vehicles. A {{large portion of the}} strength of the division had been earmarked to be detached to one of the formations of the 4th Army, Detachment Ormozki.|$|E

5|$|In his 2005 and 2006 {{biographies of}} Druitt, D. J. Leighton {{concluded}} that Druitt was innocent, but repeated some of Knight's and Wilding's discredited claims. Leighton suggested that Druitt {{could have been}} murdered, either out of greed by his elder brother William or, as previously suggested by Howells and Skinner, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> of exposure by Harry Wilson's homosexual cronies. The propensity of theorists to associate Ripper suspects with homosexuality has led scholars to assume that such notions are based on homophobia rather than evidence.|$|E
5|$|The other Great Powers {{immediately}} {{rejected the}} treaty <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> {{that such a}} large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the subsequent Treaty of Berlin, signed on 13 July, which provided for a much smaller state comprising Moesia and the region of Sofia, leaving large populations of Bulgarians outside the new country. This {{played a significant role}} in forming Bulgaria's militaristic approach to foreign affairs during the first half of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The rebels {{began to}} cross from Southwark onto London Bridge on the {{afternoon}} of 13 June.

At the same time, the rebel force from Essex made its way towards Aldgate {{on the north side of}} the city. The rebels swept west through the centre of the city, and Aldgate was opened to let the rest of the rebels in.|$|E
25|$|The {{day before}} the {{election}}, Afghan election officials ordered more than 440 polling stations to stay closed during the vote <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> election fraud.

5|$|The summit {{was held}} in the Olympic Sports Centre, Riga. Roads in the center of Riga were closed down and parking was not allowed at the airport or at several roads, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> for car bombs. About 9000 Latvian police {{officers}} and soldiers took care of the Summit's security, while more than 450 other airmen from seven European NATO countries were called upon to ensure a no-fly zone above the summit in an operation called Operation Peaceful Summit. This enhanced ongoing Baltic Air Policing activities with additional aircraft, communications and maintenance support.|$|E
5|$|The {{supposed}} refusals {{from these}} first three artists to participate {{was seen as}} evidence of self-censorship <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> of violence from Islamists, which led to much debate in Denmark. The Danish news paper Politiken stated at February 12, 2006, that they asked Bluitgen {{to put them in}} touch with the artists, so the claim that none of them dared to work with him could be proved. The author refused, and nobody has ever been able to confirm whether the incident is properly described.|$|E

50|$|The {{delay in}} the release {{of some of the}} detainees was due to {{considerations}} of their safety. Some could not be returned to their home countries, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> retaliation from their fellow citizens, or from the governments of their countries. Some, like Al Laithi, were returned to their home countries after the US secured a promise {{that they would not be}} punished by their home countries.

5|$|After unrelenting {{political}} pressure from Adolf Hitler, Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941.

A general mobilisation was not initiated by the new government until 3 April 1941, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> of offending Hitler and thus precipitating war. However, on the same day as the coup, Hitler issued Führer Directive 25 which called for Yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state, and on 3 April, Führer Directive 26 was issued, detailing the plan of attack and command structure for the German-led Axis invasion.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the origin}} of the company name is no longer known, several {{theories}} are known to exist. Most commonly, in the early 1930s, A.L.

5000|$|Devotees of Kurtzman's version {{found the}} {{magazine}} to have deteriorated after his departure. To others it lost its edge—it avoided satirizing targets such as segregation <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> hurting circulation.

While attempting to stop the group, Mario is joined by Mallow, a cloud boy who thinks he is a tadpole; Geno, a doll possessed by a celestial spirit from the Star Road; Bowser, whose armies have deserted him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> of the Smithy Gang; and Princess Toadstool, who was lost in the turmoil that occurred when the Smithy Gang arrived. The Smithy Gang is led by Smithy, a robotic blacksmith from an alternate dimension with aspirations of world domination.|$|E
5|$|Beebe {{described}} his religious beliefs {{as a combination}} of Presbyterianism and Buddhism. His religion was largely the result of seeking to combine his sense of awe and wonder at the natural world with a scientific understanding of its workings. He was highly critical of efforts to use science to justify political ideologies, such as socialism or the belief that women were inferior to men. Beebe also disapproved of the eugenic ideas advocated by many biologists in the early 20th century, including some of his contemporaries at the zoo, although this was largely <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> that these ideas would alienate friends of the zoo and cause divisions among its staff.|$|E
5|$|For example, of the 15 dolphin {{carcasses}} {{found in}} the Japurá River in 2010–2011 surveys, 73% of the dolphins were killed for bait, disposed of, or abandoned in entangled gillnets. The data does not fully represent the actual overall number of deaths of the Amazon river dolphins, whether accidental or intentional, because {{a variety of factors}} make it extremely complicated to record and medically examine all the carcasses. Scavenger species feed upon them and the complexity of the river currents makes it nearly impossible to locate all the carcasses. More importantly, the local fishermen do not report these deaths <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> that legal action will be taken against them, as the Amazon river dolphin and other cetaceans are protected under the Brazilian federal law, prohibiting any takes, harassments, and kills of the species.|$|E
5|$|Two {{additional}} {{ships were}} laid down four years later. Roma {{was built by}} the CRDA shipyard, starting on 18 September 1938.

Impero was laid down at the Ansaldo shipyard on 14 May 1938. She was launched on 15 November 1939, but she was never completed.
