The difficulty for policy-makers is to encapsulate a wide body of scientific knowledge in a labeling scheme that is comprehensible to the average shopper. Here, we describe our method of developing a nutrition metric to fill this void. Methods We asked leading nutrition experts to rate the healthiness of 205 sample foods and beverages, and after verifying the similarity of their responses, we generated a model that calculates the expected average healthiness rating that experts would give to any other product based on its nutrient content. Results The form of the model is a linear regression that places weights on 12 nutritional components (total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sugars, protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron) to predict the average healthiness rating that experts would give to any food or beverage.

Participants were instructed to complete each trial with the highest average power <b>output.</b> <b>Ratings</b> of perceived exertion (RPEs) were measured throughout the trials. Average power output was not different between the 4 -km and 6 -min trials (324 Â± 46 vs 325 Â± 45 W; P =. 96) or between the 20 -km and 30 -min trials (271 Â± 44 vs 267 Â± 38 W; P =. 24). Power output was greater on commencement of the distance-based trials when short and long trials were analyzed together. Furthermore, the rate of decline in power output over the 1 st 40 % of the trial was greater in the 20 -km trial than in the 30 -min trial (P =. 01) but not different between the 4 -km and the 6 -min trials (P =. 13). RPE was greater in the 4 -km trial than in the 6 -min trial but not different between the 20 -km and 30 -min trials. These findings indicate that athletes commenced distance-based time trials at relatively higher power outputs than a similar time-based trial.

These measures as well as an overall ranking are presented for each program. In addition, per capita productivity and quality of individual <b>output</b> <b>ratings</b> are presented to control for program faculty size; the same measures are presented with the most productive member and the most cited member of each faculty removed from the respective rankings to control for a "superstar " effect. During the past few years, various social science disciplines have shown an increasing interest in self-evaluation and in developing measures that might be used to rank or evaluate programs and departments. Efforts to evaluate departments seem to have developed from the assessments of individual reputations and scholarly productivity (Crain, 1965; Zucker-man, 1967; Cole and Cole; 1967). Originally most rankings were based on surveys of reputation such as those used by the American Council on Education (Cartter, 1966). More recently, however, rigorous measures such as publication counts have been used to rank departments and institutions. It is likely that this trend can be attributed to a &dquo;hardening of the arteries&dquo; associated with the reputational approach. Since reputations change slowly (Somit and Tanenhaus, 1967 : 152 - 155), scholars in &dquo;up and coming&dquo; institutions clearly had reason to be dissatisfied.

40|$|A {{complete}} laboratory breadboard {{version of}} a ion engine power converter was built and tested. This prototype operated on a line voltage of 80 - 120 Vdc, and provided <b>output</b> <b>ratings</b> of 1100 V at 1. 8 kW, and 250 V at 20 mA. The high-voltage (HV) output voltage rating was revised from the original value of 1350 V {{at the beginning of}} the project. The LV output was designed to hold up during a 1 -A surge current lasting up to 1 second. The prototype power converter included a internal housekeeping power supply which also operated from the line input. The power consumed in housekeeping was included in the overall energy budget presented for the ion engine converter. HV and LV output voltage setpoints were commanded through potentiometers. The HV converter itself reached its highest power efficiency of slightly over 93 % at low line and maximum output. This would dip below 90 % at high line. The no-load (rated output voltages, zero load current) power consumption of the entire system was less than 13 W. A careful loss breakdown shows that converter losses are predominately Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) conduction losses and HV rectifier snubbing losses, with the rectifier snubbing losses becoming predominant at high line. This suggests that further improvements in power efficiency could best be obtained by either developing a rectifier that was adequately protected against voltage overshoot with less snubbing, or by developing a pre-regulator to reduced the range of line voltage on the converter. The transient testing showed the converter to be fully protected against load faults, including a direct short-circuit from the HV output to the LV output terminals. Two currents sensors were used: one to directly detect any core ratcheting on the output transformer and re-initiate a soft start, and the other to directly detect a load fault and quickly shut down the converter for load protection. The finished converter has been extensively fault tested without failure. The finished converter has been packaged suitable for use as a laboratory prototype for further testing. The finished converter is readily transportable. An article on design issues for high voltage converters for ion engines is included as an attachement...|$|E

With the commercial LDOs available with <b>output</b> current <b>ratings</b> up to 10 A, and, thin profile supercapacitors with DC voltage ratings from 2. 3 V to 5. 5 V, this patented technique can be easily configured for common DC-DC converters such as 12 to 5 V, 5 to 3. 3 V and 5 to 1. 5 V. This novel topology helps increasing the end-to-end efficiency of LDO based linear converters closer to the efficiency benchmarks of modern switch mode power supplies, maintaining the superior output specifications of a linear regulator.

Both broad band and narrow band data wre obtained {{for a range of}} distances and azimuth angles from the machine. The rotor sound spectra are random in character and peak in the frequency ranges 30 to 50 Hz and 800 to 1300 Hz. Both peaks are predictable from experience with helicopter rotors and propellers. Results suggest that the lower frequency peak is due to the effects of inflow turbulence and the higher frequency peak is due to the interactions of the turbulent boundary layers with the trailing edges of the blades. The boundary layer related sound is the dominant component in the audible frequency range and determines the detectability of the machine. It could be detected at a distance of 1350 m in the upwind direction where the background noise was 30 dB (A) and at distances in excess of 2100 m in the downwind direction. Discrete frequency sound components associated with the power generation equipment are measurable in the direction normal to the axis of rotation but are not believed to be significant for detection or community response...|$|R

Percentages of maximal heart rate (%HRmax) and heart rate reserve (%HRR) are widely used to determine training intensities. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the influence of chronic cardioselective beta blockade on the %HRmax and %HRR model. Methods Ten healthy male subjects randomly received oral placebo or beta-blocker bisoprolol (5 mg/day) for 2 weeks using a double-blind, crossover design. In the second week, the subjects performed a cardiopulmonary exercise test until exhaustion to determine the aerobic (AeT) and anaerobic (AnT) threshold. Results No significant differences were found for absolute and relative values of oxygen consumption, power <b>output</b> and <b>ratings</b> of perceived exertion at AeT, AnT and maximum workload. Mean HR was significantly (P< 0. 05) lower at rest (â€“ 15 Â± 5 bpm), AeT (â€“ 19 Â± 8 bpm), AnT (â€“ 22 Â± 10 bpm) and maximal workload (â€“ 19 Â± 11 bpm) with bisoprolol compared to placebo. Percentage of maximal heart rate (%HRmax) was significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced at rest (43 versus 39 %), AeT (64 versus 60 %) and AnT (86 versus 82 %), a trend for a reduction was found for %HRR at AnT (75 versus 71 %, P= 0. 07). Conclusions Exercise prescription using %HRmax or %HRRmethods are of limited accuracy for patients taking beta-blockers.

Objective: To {{examine the effects of}} live-PSE on exercise <b>output,</b> exercise adherence, <b>ratings</b> of perceived exertion, and mood for 24 older adult inpatients in a rehabilitation facility attending a group exercise program. Methods: Using a within-subjects design, results from sessions involving exercise instruction and live-PSE (experimental condition) were compared with sessions of exercise instruction alone (control condition). A logbook documenting participant comments and behaviors was also maintained. Results: There were no significant between condition differences for the exercise outcome measures. Between condition session outcome measures for mood were non-significant for all profiles except confusion, which suggested that some participants might have become more confused during sessions with live-PSE. Unsolicited participant comments and behaviors recorded in the logbook indicated that 21 participants perceived experimental sessions positively, 2 reacted negatively, and 1 did not express any preferences. Conclusions: Live-PSE did not significantly improve exercise outcomes and there were indications of increased confusion during experimental sessions for some participants. However, participant comments and behaviors also suggested positive experiences during sessions with live-PSE. Further research to investigate these discrepant results is warranted, and might best be explored using a mixed methods approach...|$|R

To help achieve this goal, the university under Schwartz sought to hire new research active staff, and, to help fund this, {{to reduce the number}} of non-research active staff (43 eventually accepted voluntary redundancy). The redundancy programme was highly controversial and was fiercely resisted by staff unions who ran a highly personalised campaign against Schwartz.

40|$|Wind energy resources, unlike dispatchable {{central station}} generation, produce power {{dependable}} on external irregular source {{and that is}} the incident wind speed which does not always blow when electricity is needed. This results in the variability, unpredictability, and uncertainty of wind resources. Therefore, the integration of wind facilities to utility electrical grid presents a major challenge to power system operator. Such integration has significant impact on the optimum power flow, transmission congestion, power quality issues, system stability, load dispatch, and economic analysis. Due to the irregular nature of wind power production, accurate prediction represents the major challenge to power system operators. Therefore, in this thesis two novel models are proposed for wind speed and wind power prediction. One proposed model is dedicated to short-term prediction (one-hour ahead) and the other involves medium term prediction (one-day ahead). The accuracy of the proposed models is revealed by comparing their results with the corresponding values of a reference prediction model referred to as the persistent model. Utility grid operation is not only impacted by the uncertainty of the future production of wind farms, but also by the variability of their current production and how the active and reactive power exchange with the grid is controlled. To address this particular task, a control technique for wind turbines, driven by doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs), is developed to regulate the terminal voltage by equally sharing the generated/absorbed reactive power between the rotor-side and the grid-side converters. To highlight the impact of the new developed technique in reducing the power loss in the generator set, an economic analysis is carried out. Moreover, a new aggregated model for wind farms is proposed that accounts for the irregularity of the incident wind distribution throughout the farm layout. Specifically, this model includes the wake effect and the time delay of the incident wind speed of the different turbines on the farm, and to simulate the fluctuation in the generated power more accurately and more closer to real-time operation. Recently, wind farms with considerable <b>output</b> power <b>ratings</b> have been installed. Their integrating into the utility grid will substantially affect the electricity markets. This thesis investigates the possible impact of wind power variability, wind farm control strategy, wind energy penetration level, wind farm location, and wind power prediction accuracy on the total generation costs and close to real time electricity market prices. These issues are addressed by developing a single auction market model for determining the real-time electricity market prices...|$|R

Input refers to the collection of ratings and reviews; Processing is the aggregation of <b>ratings.</b> <b>Output</b> publishes the information. Feedback Loop is the collection of the feedback of the review, which {{can be seen as the}} `review of the review'; Finally, Storage stores all the information. Therefore, based on each component's characteristics, a series of benchmark criteria can be dened and incorporated into the model. Results: The SERS has dened 29 criteria, which can compare and measure different aspects of reputation systems. The model was theoretically assessed on its coverage of the successful factors of reputation systems and the technical dimensions of information systems. The model has also been empirically assessed by applying it to 15 commercial sites. Conclusion: The results obtained indicated that the SERS model has identified most important characteristics that have been proposed by reputation systems literature. In addition the SERS has covered most dimensions of the two basic technical information system measurements: information quality and system quality. The empirical assessment has shown that the SERS can evaluate dierent types of reputation systems and is capable of identifying the weakness of current systems.

40|$|Water {{resource}} management and planning in New Zealand {{has been a}} contested issue, typified by polarised positions, fragmented communities and costly court battles. Conventional top-down water planning processes have become characterised by conflicting science and opposing viewpoints. Over recent decades, {{a new form of}} planning and decision making has emerged where stakeholders and communities work collaboratively to resolve diverse perspectives and values and achieve communityaccepted policy outcomes. These collaborative processes have gained momentum and become more widespread in recent years, however, so too has the level of scrutiny and the call to evaluate their effectiveness. Given the growing application of collaborative approaches in New Zealand it is timely to consider their legitimacy. This research aims to assess the legitimacy of collaborative planning in the context of setting water resource limits. It develops an assessment framework founded on the principles of input, throughput and output legitimacy and employs a comparative case study approach to examine two regional council limit-setting processes â€“ a conventional council-led approach in Otago, and a collaborative community-driven approach in Selwyn Waihora, Canterbury. Through a participant survey, complimented by a document analysis, the research examines {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} these differing approaches against the legitimacy principles and identifies the elements that promote or challenge legitimacy claims. The research results indicate the collaborative Selwyn Waihora limit-setting process was perceived to be more legitimate than the top-down Otago planning approach. The Selwyn Waihora process performed relatively well against input and throughput legitimacy criteria, demonstrating that collaboration enables better local input, more buy-in and greater opportunities for information sharing and deliberation. It facilitates greater understanding of others views and a sense of commitment to involving and engaging the community. It also enhances problem-solving and innovation capability and the likelihood that common ground can be realised. The research does, however, indicate that while the Selwyn Waihora process was also more legitimate in terms of <b>output</b> criteria, the <b>ratings</b> for both the outcome effectiveness and the reflection of community input in the outcome were low given it was promoted as a communitydriven process...|$|R
40|$|State-of-the-art {{electronic}} systems employ three fundamental techniques for DC-DC converters: (a) {{switch-mode power supplies}} (SMPS); (b) linear power supplies; (c) switched capacitor (charge pump) converters. In practical systems, these three techniques are mixed to provide a complex, but elegant, overall solution, with energy efficiency, effective PCB footprint, noise and transient performance to suit different electronic circuit blocks. Switching regulators have relatively high end-to-end efficiency, {{in the range of}} 70 to 93 %, but can have issues with output noise and EMI/RFI emissions. Switched capacitor converters use a set of capacitors for energy storage and conversion. In general, linear regulators have low efficiencies in the range 30 to 60 %. However, they have outstanding output characteristics such as low noise, excellent transient response to load current fluctuations, design simplicity and low cost design which are far superior to SMPS. Given the complex situation in switch-mode converters, low dropout (LDO) regulators were introduced to address the equirements of noise-sensitive and fast transient loads in portable devices. A typical commercial off-the-shelf LDO has its input voltage slightly higher than the desired regulated output for optimal efficiency. The approximate efficiency of a linear regulator, if the power consumed by the control circuits is negligible, can be expressed by the ratio of Vo/Vin. A very low frequency supercapacitor circulation technique can be combined with commercial low dropout regulator ICs to significantly increase the end-to-end efficiency by a multiplication factor in the range of 1. 33 to 3, compared to the efficiency of a linear regulator circuit with the same input-output voltages. In this patented supercapacitor-assisted low dropout (SCALDO) regulator technique developed by a research team at the University of Waikato, supercapacitors are used as lossless voltage droppers, and the energy reuse occurs at very low frequencies in the range of less than ten hertz, eliminating RFI/EMI concerns. This SCALDO technique opens up a new approach to design step-down, DC-DC converters suitable for processor power supplies with very high end-to-end efficiency which is closer to the efficiencies of practical switching regulators, while maintaining the superior output specifications of a linear design. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that the SCALDO technique is not a variation of well-known switched capacitor DC-DC converters. In this thesis, the basic SCALDO concept is further developed to achieve generalised topologies, with the relevant theory that can be applied to a converter with any input-output step-down voltage combination. For these generalised topologies, some important design parameters, such as the number of supercapacitors, switching matrix details and efficiency improvement factors, are derived to form the basis of designing SCALDO regulators. With the availability of commercial LDO ICs with <b>output</b> current <b>ratings</b> up to 10 A, and thin-prole supercapacitors with DC voltage ratings from 2. 3 to 5. 5 V, several practically useful, medium-current SCALDO prototypes: 12 V-to- 5 V, 5 V-to- 2 V, 5. 5 V-to- 3. 3 V have been developed. Experimental studies were carried out on these SCALDO prototypes to quantify performance in terms of line regulation, load regulation, efficiency and transient response. In order to accurately predict the performance and associated waveforms of the individual phases (charge, discharge and transition) of the SCALDO regulator, Laplace transform-based theory for supercapacitor circulation is developed, and analytical predictions are compared with experimental measurements for a 12 V-to- 5 V prototype. The analytical results tallied well with the practical waveforms observed in a 12 V-to- 5 V converter, indicating that the SCALDO technique can be generalized to other versatile configurations, and confirming that the simplified assumptions used to describe the circuit elements are reasonable and justifiable. After analysing the performance of several SCALDO prototypes, some practical issues in designing SCALDO regulators have been identified. These relate to power losses and implications for future development of the SCALDO design...|$|R
