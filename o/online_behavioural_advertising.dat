40|$|<b>Online</b> <b>Behavioural</b> {{targeted}} <b>Advertising</b> (OBA) {{has risen}} in prominence {{as a method}} to increase the effectiveness of online advertising. OBA operates by associating tags or labels to users based on their online activity and then using these labels to target them. This rise {{has been accompanied by}} privacy concerns from researchers, regulators and the press. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for measuring and understanding OBA in the online advertising market. We rely on training artificial <b>online</b> personas representing <b>behavioural</b> traits like 'cooking', 'movies', 'motor sports', etc. and build a measurement system that is automated, scalable and supports testing of multiple configurations. We observe that OBA is a frequent practice and notice that categories valued more by advertisers are more intensely targeted. In addition, we provide evidences showing that the advertising market targets sensitive topics (e. g, religion or health) despite the existence of regulation that bans such practices. We also compare the volume of OBA advertising for our personas in two different geographical locations (US and Spain) and see little geographic bias in terms of intensity of OBA targeting. Finally, we check for targeting with do-not-track (DNT) enabled and discover that DNT is not yet enforced in the web. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R

Hypertext Engineering, Fettling or Tinkering (Mark Anderson) : Contributors to a public hypertext such as Wikipedia do not necessarily record their maintenance activities, but some specific hypertext features - such transclusion - could indicate deliberate editing with a mind to the hypertext’s long-term use. The MediaWiki software used to create Wikipedia supports transclusion, a deliberately hypertextual form of content creation which aids long terms consistency. This discusses {{the evidence of the}} use of hypertext transclusion in Wikipedia, and its implications for the coherence and stability of Wikipedia.

Authors: Jean-Marc Desfougères and Valentin Bloux Supervisor: Albert Thor Magnusson Level: Bachelor Thesis in Business Administration Marketing Key Words: <b>Behavioural</b> <b>advertising,</b> Facebook, privacy, <b>online</b> consumer behaviour, social network, leisure industry, targeting. Purpose: {{study how}} a specific age bracket of Facebook users perceives the leisure industry <b>behavioural</b> <b>advertising</b> on this social networking site. Method: This thesis follows a deductive approach. We are using secondary data from books, articles and studies but also primary data {{thanks to a}} questionnaire; which allows us to answer our purpose. Theoretical Framework: First define the online consumer behaviour and its characteristics through existing models and then define <b>behavioural</b> <b>advertising,</b> how is the leisure industry using this marketing tool {{and what are the}} drawbacks of such practices. Conclusion: The authors conclude that Facebook users are more and more aware of the use of <b>behavioural</b> <b>advertising.</b> But {{due to a lack of}} education about such marketing techniques the 18 - 30 years old tend to adopt mostly strict privacy settings with the intention to block those advertisements. The privacy issue is important and even if the users seems to be interested in the offers of the leisure industry there is still a long way before obtaining a full acceptance of this practice.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of new forms of interactions in the online environment, as social media, search engine and e-commerce has shifted the business industry and introduced a data-driven economy, where data has become the new commodity. As a consequence, agents engaged in commercial activities have been collecting massive data from internet users, for instance, to predict consumer behaviour and to place tailored advertisement based on the users’ interests. <b>Online</b> <b>behavioural</b> advertisement can be legitimate and it has {{an important role in}} the digital economy, as it supports the offer of free services and it can result in better services and products to be offered to consumers. On the other hand, it raises privacy and data protection concerns, as it involves massive collection and processing of data by different agents. The legal treatment of profiling for <b>online</b> <b>behavioural</b> advertisement shall substantially change with the introduction of the new General Data Protection Regulation, which brings new provisions for processing personal data, particularly in the online environment. Given the relevance of the new Regulation, its legislative process was surrounded by pressure and lobby by privacy authorities and industry. The final result of the Regulation is a long and complex framework, which imposes several new obligations to the companies, whereas user’s rights are substantially strengthened. However, privacy advocates argue that the final text of the Regulation could be better in terms of protecting users. The purpose of this work is to analyse whether: i) the final text GDPR provides an efficient protection of privacy and data protection in the digital context and; ii) whether the GDPR offers the agents engaged on <b>online</b> <b>behavioural</b> advertisement some level of flexibility on their business activities, insofar as they can explore the economic potentials of a data-driven economy...|$|R

40|$|Online {{advertising}} is a multi-billion dollar industry, forming {{one of the}} primary sources of income for many publishers that offer free web content. <b>Online</b> <b>Behavioural</b> <b>Advertising</b> (OBA), the practice of showing advertisements based on individual users' web browsing behaviours, greatly improves the expected effectiveness of advertisements, and is believed to be beneficial to advertisers and users alike. The privacy of users, however, is threatened by the widespread collection and exchange of users' browsing behaviour by dozens of companies for the purpose of behavioural advertising. The aim of this thesis is to alleviate these privacy concerns by investigating how an online advertising system can serve advertisements tailored to users' interests within the current online advertising ecosystem, such that no party other than the user themselves can gain any knowledge of the user's interests. To protect user privacy in the online advertising ecosystem, two main challenges need to be overcome. Not only do advertising companies need to adapt their machine learning models to a setting in which they have no knowledge of user interests, they also need to integrate their privacy-preserving targeting systems into a complex advertising landscape where advertisement impressions are traded within a fraction of a second. We present two complete privacy-preserving protocols for <b>online</b> <b>behavioural</b> <b>advertising</b> that combine machine learning methods commonly encountered in existing advertising systems with secure multi-party computation techniques. The first protocol uses a threshold variant of an additively homomorphic cryptosystem to distribute trust between parties while allowing computations on encrypted data, such that advertisements can be served based on detailed user profiles. The second protocol distributes trust between advertising companies using an additively homomorphic threshold secret sharing scheme, allowing collaborative computations on user profiles while preventing a coalition of colluding parties smaller than a predefined threshold from obtaining any sensitive information. Both protocols achieve performance multilinear in the size of user profiles and the number of advertising campaigns, and show promising initial results in terms of privacy and performance. To the best of our knowledge, our two protocols are the first protocols that preserve user privacy in behavioural advertising while allowing the use of detailed user profiles and machine learning methods.

40|$|<b>Online</b> <b>Behavioural</b> <b>Advertising</b> (OBA) enables {{promotion}} {{companies to}} effectively target users with ads that best satisfy their purchasing needs. This is {{highly beneficial for}} both vendors and publishers who are {{the owners of the}} advertising platforms, such as websites and app developers, {{but at the same time}} creates a serious privacy threat for users who expose their consumer interests. In this paper, we categorize the available ad-distribution methods and identify their limitations in terms of security, privacy, targeting effectiveness and practicality. We contribute our own system, which utilizes opportunistic networking in order to distribute targeted adverts within a social network. We improve upon previous work by eliminating the need for trust among the users (network nodes) while at the same time achieving low memory and bandwidth overhead, which are inherent problems of many opportunistic networks. Our protocol accomplishes this by identifying similarities between the consumer interests of users and then allows them to share access to the same adverts, which need to be downloaded only once. Although the same ads may be viewed by multiple users, privacy is preserved as the users do not learn each other’s advertising interests. An additional contribution is that malicious users cannot alter the ads in order to spread malicious content, and also, they cannot launch impersonation attacks...|$|E

40|$|<b>Online</b> <b>behavioural</b> <b>advertising</b> (OBA) is {{a special}} form of {{targeted}} advertising. For OBA, {{it is necessary to}} collect data about online surfing behaviour, which is usually undertaken by installing ‘cookies’. The use of cookies is heavily debated by policy makers in the US and Europe. Central to this discussion is whether users should provide informed consent prior to the installation of cookies. However, to provide informed consent, it is vital that website users understand the mechanisms of OBA and cookies. This study investigates whether the existing knowledge is sufficient, whether website users are concerned about their privacy, and how they cope with OBA, cookies and the requested informed consent. An online questionnaire (N = 2022) was fielded briefly after new European cookie regulations were enacted. The results confirmed that the knowledge is still insufficient to obtain good understanding of this new advertising technique. In addition, the results showed that groups of Internet users did not differ in terms of knowledge, although they did differ in terms of privacy concerns. A comparison of privacy-concerned groups showed that a dual approach is needed in communicating about OBA, not only to inform but also to reduce worries, especially in older and less-educated groups...|$|E
40|$|<b>Online</b> <b>behavioural</b> <b>advertising</b> (OBA) {{comes to}} {{consumers}} at a price. Often unknowingly, people deliver up commercially-valuable personal information {{as a condition}} of online user experience, functionality and access. Websites are increasingly tracking user behaviours for commercial purposes and social media derives its income largely from data collection and advertising targeted to the personal disclosures and behavioural attributes which are its data-production mainstay. In this context, consumers face a plethora of information collection practices, all designed to generate data analytics including inferential and predictive profiling to create a 2 ̆ 7 digital identity 2 ̆ 7 for OBA purposes. In this subterranean exchange, consumers are economically redefined as data subjects and advertising targets; a reframing which is perhaps why the OBA industry faces a crisis in consumer concern, both as to privacy and trust. This paper proposes that the regulatory control of OBA in Australia is in disarray. Consumer ignorance of online privacy management and OBA practices is demonstrable. Industry transparency, disclosure, consent processes and compliance practices are questionable. Regulator interest is minimal, industry self-regulation is weak and consumer technical ability and personal responsibility is a last fragile line of defence. Data breaches are ubiquitous in a crowded and poorly-audited supply chain, and entail significant adverse consumer consequences. Yet despite these serious concerns, Australian regulators are failing to respond to OBA issues, either through mandating greater industry disclosure or through regulatory action. The author seeks to expose these weaknesses in calling for consumer and privacy regulators to take more meaningful action to better protect consumers 2 ̆ 7 interests onlin...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{the subject}} of online privacy has been {{attracting}} much interest, especially as more Internet users than ever are beginning {{to care about the}} privacy of their online activities. Privacy concerns are even prompting legislators in some countries to demand from service providers a more privacy-friendly Internet experience for their citizens. These are welcomed developments and {{in stark contrast to the}} practice of Internet censorship and surveillance that legislators in some nations have been known to promote. The development of Internet systems that are able to protect user privacy requires private information retrieval (PIR) schemes that are practical, because no other efficient techniques exist for preserving the confidentiality of the retrieval requests and responses of a user from an Internet system holding unencrypted data. This thesis studies how PIR schemes can be made more relevant and practical for the development of systems that are protective of users' privacy. Private information retrieval schemes are cryptographic constructions for retrieving data from a database, without the database (or database administrator) being able to learn any information about the content of the query. PIR can be applied to preserve the confidentiality of queries to online data sources in many domains, such as online patents, real-time stock quotes, Internet domain names, location-based services, <b>online</b> <b>behavioural</b> profiling and <b>advertising,</b> search engines, and so on. In this thesis, we study private information retrieval and obtain results that seek to make PIR more relevant in practice than all previous treatments of the subject in the literature, which have been mostly theoretical. We also show that PIR is the most computationally efficient known technique for providing access privacy under realistic computation powers and network bandwidths. Our result covers all currently known varieties of PIR schemes. We provide a more detailed summary of our contributions below: Our first result addresses an existing question regarding the computational practicality of private information retrieval schemes. We show that, unlike previously argued, recent lattice-based computational PIR schemes and multi-server information-theoretic PIR schemes are much more computationally efficient than a trivial transfer of the entire PIR database from the server to the client (i. e., trivial download). Our result shows the end-to-end response times of these schemes are one to three orders of magnitude (10 [...] 1000 times) smaller than the trivial download of the database for realistic computation powers and network bandwidths. This result extends and clarifies the well-known result of Sion and Carbunar on the computational practicality of PIR. Our second result is a novel approach for preserving the privacy of sensitive constants in an SQL query, which improves substantially upon the earlier work. Specifically, we provide an expressive data access model of SQL atop of the existing rudimentary index- and keyword-based data access models of PIR. The expressive SQL-based model developed results in between 7 and 480 times improvement in query throughput than previous work. We then provide a PIR-based approach for preserving access privacy over large databases. Unlike previously published access privacy approaches, we explore new ideas about privacy-preserving constraint-based query transformations, offline data classification, and privacy-preserving queries to index structures much smaller than the databases. This work addresses an important open problem about how real systems can systematically apply existing PIR schemes for querying large databases. In terms of applications, we apply PIR to solve user privacy problem in the domains of patent database query and location-based services, user and database privacy problems in the domain of the online sales of digital goods, and a scalability problem for the Tor anonymous communication network. We develop practical tools for most of our techniques, which can be useful for adding PIR support to existing and new Internet system designs...|$|R
