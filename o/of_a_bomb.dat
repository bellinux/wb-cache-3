5|$|At {{the time}} of the letter, the {{estimated}} material necessary for a fission chain reaction was several tons. Seven months later a breakthrough in Britain would estimate the necessary critical mass to be less than 10 kilograms, making delivery <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> by air a possibility.|$|E
5|$|Dazed {{survivors}} immediately {{feared that}} the explosion was the result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> dropped from a German plane. Troops at gun batteries and barracks immediately turned out in case the city was under attack, but within an hour switched from defence to rescue roles as the cause and location of the explosion were determined. All available troops were called in from harbour fortifications and barracks to the North End to rescue survivors and provide transport to the city's hospitals, including the two army hospitals in the city.|$|E

5|$|The Grumman XTSF was a {{proposed}} twin-engine torpedo scout aircraft, designed by Grumman for the United States Navy {{towards the end}} of World War II. Based on the design of the Grumman F7F Tigercat fighter, enlarged and with the addition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> bay, the XTSF was deemed too large for carrier operations, and the project was cancelled before any aircraft were built. Instead, the Navy chose to order the single-engine XTB3F, which became the successful AF Guardian.|$|E
5|$|Another man {{is found}} dead by a self-inflicted bullet wound, though Dana was seen leaving his {{apartment}}. Evidence {{in his apartment}} points to the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bomb,</b> and the Fringe team suspects that Dana knows its location and may be hoping to exploit an event which will kill several people simultaneously {{in order to increase}} her own chances of death. Peter calls her, using caller ID spoofing to disguise his number as that of her late husband, and the signal allows authorities to pinpoint her location to a commuter train. The train is stopped and searched, while Dana leaves on her own with the bomb, moving it far enough away from the train. The bomb soon explodes, and when Peter and Lincoln search, they find Dana's body nearby, finally dead, and the only fatality from the explosion.|$|E
5|$|On Mardi Gras in New Orleans, {{the ferry}} Sen. Alvin T. Stumpf is {{carrying}} hundreds of U.S. Navy sailors {{and their families}} across the Mississippi River from their base to the city. Suddenly, the ferry explodes and sinks, killing 543 passengers and crew members. Special Agent Douglas Carlin (Denzel Washington) from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is sent to investigate and discovers evidence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> planted by a domestic terrorist. Arriving at the scene he meets with local investigators and FBI Special Agent Paul Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer), and informs them of his findings. He learns about and is invited to examine a partially burned body pulled from the river, identified as Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton), which was reported to the authorities minutes before the explosion.|$|E

5|$|Sisko and Lieutenant Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) {{board the}} Enterprise but {{can find no}} trace <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bomb.</b> They travel to K7, and scans {{indicate}} that the bomb is in the grain storage compartments. They enter the compartments and discover that the poisoned grain has all been eaten by tribbles, who are now all dead. Suddenly Captain Kirk opens the compartment and is covered in falling tribbles. Dax and Sisko find the bomb before it can kill Kirk and the Defiant transports it into space where it explodes. The crew of the Defiant use the Bajoran Orb to travel {{back to the present}} time, and Sisko finishes explaining the situation to the Temporal Agents. The episode ends with Quark (Armin Shimerman) in his bar on Deep Space Nine's promenade, with numerous tribbles around him.|$|E
5|$|The {{conspiracy}} {{issue was}} ultimately addressed by William G. E. Wiseman, head of British {{intelligence in the}} United States, when he passed details <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> plot directly to the New York Police bypassing diplomatic channels. This led {{to the arrest of}} Chandra Kanta Chuckrevarty. As the links between Chuckervarty's papers and the Igel papers became apparent, investigations by federal authorities expanded to cover the entire conspiracy. Ultimately, the United States agreed to forward evidence so long as Britain did not seek admission of liability for breaches of neutrality. At a time that diplomatic relations with Germany were deteriorating, the British Foreign Office directed its embassy to co-operate with the investigations resolving the Anglo-American diplomatic disputes just as the United States entered the war.|$|E
5|$|Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr. became {{director}} of the Manhattan Project on 23 September 1942. He visited Berkeley to look at Lawrence's calutrons, and met with Oppenheimer, who gave him a report on bomb design on 8 October. Groves was interested in Oppenheimer's proposal to establish a separate bomb design laboratory. When they met again in Chicago a week later, he invited Oppenheimer to discuss the issue. Groves had to catch a train to New York, so he asked Oppenheimer to accompany him {{so that they could}} continue the discussion. Groves, Oppenheimer, and Colonel James C. Marshall and Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Nichols all squeezed into a single compartment where they talked about how a bomb laboratory could be created, and how it would function. Groves subsequently had Oppenheimer come to Washington, D.C., where the matter was discussed with Vannevar Bush, the {{director of}} the OSRD, and James B. Conant, the chairman of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC). On 19 October, Groves approved the establishment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> laboratory.|$|E

5|$|Having {{discovered}} a lost briefcase in a park, Tintin returns {{it to its}} owner, the sigillographer Professor Hector Alembick, who informs the reporter of his plans {{to travel to the}} Balkan nation of Syldavia. Tintin discovers secret agents spying on him and follows those responsible to a nearby Syldavian restaurant. An unknown man agrees to meet with Tintin, but is found unconscious. Shortly after, the reporter receives a threatening note and is then the target <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> attack; but survives the latter when police detectives Thomson and Thompson intercept the bomb. Suspecting that these events are linked to Syldavia, Tintin decides to accompany Professor Alembick on his forthcoming visit to the country. On the plane journey there, Tintin notices Alembick acting out of character, and suspects that an imposter has replaced him. Reading a brochure on Syldavian history, Tintin theorises that the imposter is part of a plot to steal the sceptre of the Medieval King Ottokar IV from the current King Muskar XII before St. Vladimir's Day, thus forcing him to abdicate.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to other Germanophile mouthpieces, Seara stated {{its support for}} the Central Powers early on, before such financing could occur—even before its patron Cantacuzino decided which side he supported. In the months of strife which preceded the actual war, the Romanian daily published telegrams and concerned commentary {{about the effects of}} nationalism in Central Europe and the Balkans. These accused the Greek Kingdom and Northern Epirote militias of decimating the Aromanian community in Korçë during April 1914, and urged Romanians to express their indignation. A month later, Seara was taking a stand against Romanian irredentism over Transylvania, as analyzed by the Transylvanian Germanophile Ioan Slavici. Slavici's texts scandalized the nationalist press for supporting Vasile Mangra, the pro-Hungarian priest and suspected agent of influence. However, the newspaper was also criticizing the Hungarian authorities for demanding the extradition of university student Măndăchescu. The latter, Seara reported, was wrongly accused <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> attack on the Diocese of Hajdúdorog, when the act was more likely attributable to the revolutionist Ilie Cătărău.|$|E
5|$|The {{project began}} after it emerged {{that the three}} IRA members shot in Gibraltar {{were found to be}} unarmed and not in {{possession}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bomb.</b> The series' editor, Roger Bolton, dispatched journalists to Gibraltar and Spain, where they interviewed several people who witnessed the shootings as well as Spanish police officers who had been involved in surveillance of the IRA team. The journalists also filmed the funerals of the IRA members in Belfast. Satisfied by the journalists' findings, Bolton sought a conclusion to the programme; as the British government refused to comment, Bolton recruited a leading human rights lawyer to give his opinion on the findings. The documentary was broadcast on 28 April 1988 (just under two months after the shootings), despite two attempts by Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe to have the Independent Broadcasting Authority postpone the broadcast. Using the eyewitness statements, the documentary questioned the government's version of events, and suggested that the three IRA members may have been unlawfully killed. Reporter Julian Manyon summed up the programme's findings: none of the witnesses interviewed for the programme heard the soldiers challenge the trio before opening fire, but variously believed they had seen the IRA members shot in the back, with their hands up, or after falling to the ground. The final contributor was the lawyer recruited by Bolton, who suggested that a judicial inquiry was necessary to resolve the conflicts.|$|E

25|$|Further {{examination}} of the airplane structure, seats, and other interior components found no damage typically associated with a high-energy explosion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> or missile warhead ("severe pitting, cratering, petalling, or hot gas washing"). This included the pieces on which trace amounts of explosives were found. Of the 5 percent of the fuselage that was not recovered, none of the missing areas were large enough to have covered all the damage {{that would have been}} caused by the detonation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> or missile. None of the victims' remains showed any evidence of injuries that could have been caused by high-energy explosives.|$|E

50|$|The panic was {{possibly}} {{caused by a}} sudden bang {{which may have been}} the result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> firecracker, and someone shouting that <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> had gone off may have fueled the panic.

25|$|Early in {{the morning}} of Day 32 (6 July 2008), the Big Brother house was {{evacuated}} because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> scare.
