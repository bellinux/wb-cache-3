25|$|Despite the {{impressive}} results, Semmelweis's ideas were not {{accepted by the}} other obstetricians in Budapest.

He continued to believe that puerperal fever was due to uncleanliness of the bowel. Therefore, extensive purging was the preferred treatment.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>obstetrics</b> as {{a practice}} for accredited doctors {{happened at the}} turn of the 18th century and thus was very differently developed in Europe and in the Americas due to the independence of many countries in the Americas from European powers. “Unlike in Europe and the British Isles, where midwifery laws were national, in America, midwifery laws were local and varied widely”.|$|E
25|$|Clemetson {{immigrated to}} Saskatoon, Canada (1958–1961), {{becoming}} {{an assistant professor}} <b>of</b> <b>Obstetrics</b> and Gynecology at the University of Saskatoon.

25|$|After Birly died in 1854, Semmelweis {{applied for}} the position. So did Carl Braun— Semmelweis's nemesis and {{successor}} as Johann Klein's assistant in Vienna— and Braun received more votes from his Hungarian colleagues than Semmelweis did. Semmelweis was eventually appointed in 1855, but only because the Viennese authorities overruled {{the wishes of the}} Hungarians, as Braun did not speak Hungarian. As professor <b>of</b> <b>obstetrics,</b> Semmelweis instituted chlorine washings at the University of Pest maternity clinic. Once again, the results were impressive.|$|E

25|$|Semmelweis {{declined}} {{an offer}} in 1857 to become professor <b>of</b> <b>obstetrics</b> at the University of Zurich.

They had five children: a son who died shortly after birth, a daughter who {{died at the age of}} four months, another son who committed suicide at age 23 (possibly due to gambling debts), another daughter who would remain unmarried, and a third daughter who would have children of her own.|$|E
25|$|Men were {{introduced}} into the field <b>of</b> <b>obstetrics</b> {{in the nineteenth century}} and resulted in a change of the focus of this profession. Gynaecology directly resulted as a new and separate field of study from obstetrics and focused on the curing of illness and indispositions of female sexual organs. This had some relevance to some conditions as menopause, uterine and cervical problems, and childbirth could leave the mother in need of extensive surgery to repair tissue. But, there was also a large blame of the uterus for completely unrelated conditions. This led to many social consequences of the nineteenth century.|$|E
