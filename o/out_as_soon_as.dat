5|$|In {{spring of}} 2001, the {{secondary}} hijackers began {{arriving in the}} United States. In July 2001, Atta met with bin al-Shibh in Spain, where they coordinated details of the plot, including final target selection. Bin al-Shibh also passed along bin Laden's wish for the attacks to be carried <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible. Some of the hijackers received passports from corrupt Saudi officials who were family members, or used fraudulent passports to gain entry.|$|E
5|$|The {{action was}} {{illuminated}} in brief, blinding flashes by Jap searchlights which were shot <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> they were turned on, by muzzle flashes from big guns, by fantastic streams of tracers, and by huge orange-colored explosions as two Jap destroyers {{and one of}} our destroyers blew up... From the beach it resembled a door to hell opening and closing... over and over.|$|E
25|$|Horse trams, {{a legacy}} of the old private tramway companies, were phased <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> they could be {{replaced}} by steam or electric traction. The steam trams continued in service for many decades, initially to continue services while installation of electrical infrastructure was still underway, but eventually relegated to non-revenue operations and providing additional capacity at times of heavy loadings.|$|E

25|$|In April 2015 a {{technical}} report {{concluded that it}} was feasible to raise the wreck of Sewol and President Park said she hoped {{that it would be}} carried <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible. Following the receipt of tenders from salvage companies, it was announced on 15 July 2015 that a consortium led by China's Shanghai Salvage Company was the favoured bidder, at a cost of 85.1 billion won (US$74.6 million).|$|E
25|$|Tigres' biggest rival is Monterrey. Their derby {{is called}} Clásico Regiomontano. On every Clásico the stadium is sold <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> tickets go on sale. It {{is known for}} {{being one of the}} most intense and competed derbies in Mexican football, and is widely {{regarded}} as the most important Mexican derby after the Clásico Nacional. Tigres and Monterrey played their first Clásico on 13 July 1974 at the Estadio Universitario, game that ended with a 3–3 draw.|$|E
25|$|I {{knew the}} Englishmen would test me <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> I walked out. Ian Botham. Bob Willis. I {{remember}} facing Ian Botham when I went out there, {{and he did}} test me out. Fortunately enough I did hook him for a six, but I must admit {{it was more of}} a top edge. Adelaide Oval had quite short square boundaries, and it managed to clear them for a six. Of course he tested me out a few more times.|$|E

25|$|On January 4, 2013, the World Health Organization {{called for}} the Sabin OPV, which {{contains}} the type 2 strain of poliovirus, to be phased <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible; although the type 2 strain has been eradicated in the wild, vaccine-derived strains still circulate in polio-endemic nations. A different OPV {{would continue to be}} administered, protecting against types 1 and 3, which are both still endemic in the wild in Nigeria, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The WHO also {{called for the}} rapid introduction of the Salk IPV, which will be used along with OPV during a transition period. Once types 1 and 3 cease to be endemic, the OPV will be phased out, and the Salk vaccine will be used exclusively.|$|E
25|$|Roche was {{appointed}} captain {{of a company}} of foot soldiers in the East India Service, and embarked in the Vansittart for India in May 1773. Apparently Roche {{was in such a}} temper that he fell out with all the passengers, including a Captain Ferguson, who called him <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> they arrived at Madeira. Roche was seized with a sudden and unaccountable fit of terror, and refused to fight. The early arrogance and later cowardice he had displayed revolted the whole body of the passengers, and the captain of the ship expelled him from the table, leaving Roche to join the common sailors and soldiers on board the ship. With these he endeavoured to ingratiate himself by claiming vengeance against every gentleman and officer on board the ship. His threats were particularly directed against Ferguson, whom he considered the origin of the disgrace he suffered.|$|E
500|$|Stephen, who named himself Stephen III in {{his only}} {{preserved}} charter, [...] "seemed grievous and was excessively oppressive {{to the principal}} personages" [...] in Hungary, according to Kinnamos. A group of Hungarian lords started conspiring against Stephen in favor of his expelled nephew. At Stephen's request, Emperor Manuel sent an army to Hungary in March, however {{the news of the}} approaching imperial army strengthened Stephen's position, so he sent the Byzantines back. But it was too late, and a rebellion broke <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> the Byzantine troops left Hungary.|$|E

Mike Shinoda confirmed his death on Twitter, writing, [...] "Shocked and heartbroken, but it's true. An official statement will come <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> we have one". On July 21, Brian Elias, the chief of operations for the office of the medical examiner-coroner, confirmed thata half-empty bottle of alcohol was found at the scene, but no other drugs were present. The band announced that they had canceled the North American Tour of their One More Light Tour following Bennington's death and those tickets will be refunded.|$|E
2500|$|Jeffries {{remained}} mostly {{hidden from}} media attention {{until the day}} of the fight, while Johnson soaked up the spotlight. John L. Sullivan, who made boxing championships a popular and esteemed spectacle, stated that Johnson was in such good physical shape compared to Jeffries that he could lose only if he had a lack of skill on the day. Before the fight, Jeffries remarked, [...] "It is my intention to go right after my opponent and knock him <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible." [...] While his wife added, [...] "I'm not interested in prizefighting but I am interested in my husband's welfare, I do hope this will be his last fight." [...] Johnson's words were [...] "May the best man win." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tatsumi Kumashiro {{was born}} on April 24, 1927 in Saga, on Kyūshū—the southernmost of Japan's four main islands. [...] His father was a {{pharmaceuticals}} merchant and judo master descended from the samurai class. A strict disciplinarian, Kumashiro's father believed in the warrior philosophy of Yamamoto Tsunetomo as written in Hagakure and supported Japan's military exploits of the 1930s and 1940s. Early in life Kumashiro rebelled against this upbringing by immersing himself in film and Western literature. During World War II, Kumashiro entered medical school {{as a means of}} avoiding the draft, but dropped <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> the war ended in Japan's defeat. He studied English literature at Waseda University, but, deciding he could not make a living writing novels, entered Shochiku studio as an assistant director in 1952, and moved to Nikkatsu in 1955.|$|E

2500|$|The Replacements {{returned}} to New York in June 1983, playing at CBGB. The gig was a failure; the band were almost refused entry, Bob Stinson was thrown <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> {{he walked in}} the door, and the Replacements were the last of five bands, which meant they played {{in the early morning}} on a Monday night. The show at Folk City was not a success, because [...] "The Replacements were so loud and obnoxious that the people just cleared right out," [...] according to manager Jesperson. The band supported R.E.M. on an eight-date tour later that summer, deciding that they should alienate the audience as much as possible. It was not a successful tour; by the end, various members had threatened to leave the Replacements. Band morale was low, and Westerberg later stated, [...] "We'd much rather play for fifty people who know us than a thousand who don't care." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 'The most repugnant of {{all their}} {{practices}} is that of male concubinage. A Kodiak mother will select her handsomest and most promising boy, and dress and rear him as a girl, teaching him only domestic duties, keeping him at women's work, associating him with women and girls, in order to render his effeminacy complete. Arriving {{at the age of}} ten or fifteen years, he is married to some wealthy man who regards such a companion as a great acquisition. These male concubines are called Achnutschik or Schopans' (the authorities quoted being Holmberg, Langsdorff, Billing, Choris, Lisiansky and Marchand). The same is the case in Nootka Sound and the Aleutian Islands, where 'male concubinage obtains throughout, but not to the same extent as amongst the Koniagas.' The male concubines have their beards carefully plucked <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> the face-hair begins to grow, and their chins are tattooed like those of the women. In California the first missionaries found the same practice, the youths being called Joya.|$|E
2500|$|The {{motivation}} of the German soldiers tumbled. [...] "Now there is disappointment, {{and it is}} huge", Thaer wrote in April 1918, [...] "This is why even assaults, even when well-prepared with artillery attacks, fizzled <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> our infantry reached the heavily pummeled zone". [...] Until the German army's failed Spring offensive the German army was not as badly affected by [...] "flight from the flag" [...] (desertion) as the entente armies, however. [...] Initially, during the 1918 spring offensive, German troop motivation and morale surged, only crumbling again after the offensive failed. [...] Thaer commented in his diary, [...] "personally I had to force myself to {{the conviction that the}} troops now operated under a crushing burden of disappointment. [...] The attacking spirit of 21 March and the days that followed which I experienced to the south of Arras 4- 6 weeks ago was no longer there. ... It is clear to every company commander and every battery commander, and indeed to every musketeer and gunner, that hope has been shattered ... For the weaker characters there are already bad consequences: [...] general overload (Allgemeine Drückebergerei) ...".|$|E

2500|$|During the Spain meetings, Atta and bin al-Shibh had {{coordinated the}} details of the attacks. The 9/11 Commission {{obtained}} details about the meeting, based on interrogations of bin al-Shibh in the weeks after his arrest in September 2002. Bin al-Shibh explained that he passed along instructions from Osama bin Laden, including his desire for the attacks to be carried <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible. Bin Laden was concerned about having so many operatives in the United States. Atta confirmed that all the muscle hijackers had arrived in the United States, without any problems, but said that he needed five to six more weeks to work out details. Bin Laden also asked that other operatives not be informed of the specific data until the last minute. During the meeting, Atta and bin al-Shibh also decided on the targets to be hit, ruling out a strike on a nuclear plant. Bin al-Shibh passed along bin Laden's list of targets; bin Laden wanted the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center to be attacked, as they were deemed [...] "symbols of America." [...] If any of the hijackers could not reach their intended targets, Atta said, they were to crash the plane. They also discussed the personal difficulties Atta was having with fellow hijacker Ziad Jarrah. Bin al-Shibh was worried that Jarrah might even abandon the plan. The 9/11 Commission Report speculated that the now-convicted terrorist conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui was being trained as a possible replacement for Jarrah.|$|E
