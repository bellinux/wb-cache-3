5|$|Around Vikram 1664 (1607 CE), Tulsidas was {{afflicted by}} acute pain {{all over his}} body, {{especially}} in his arms. He then composed the Hanuman Bahuk, where he describes his bodily pain and suffering in several stanzas. He was relieved of his pain after this composition. Later he was also afflicted by Bartod boils (Hindi: बरतोड़, furuncles caused by pulling out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair),</b> {{which may have been}} the cause of his death.|$|E

50|$|Hair follicles are {{to varying}} degrees {{sensitive}} to androgen, primarily testosterone and its derivatives, with different areas on the body having different sensitivity. As androgen levels increase, <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> growth and <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> increase. Genetic factors determine both individual levels <b>of</b> androgen and <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> follicle's sensitivity to androgen, {{as well as other}} characteristics such as hair colour, type of hair and hair retention.|$|R
5|$|Horses require routine {{hoof care}} from a farrier, {{as well as}} vaccinations to protect against various diseases, and dental {{examinations}} from a veterinarian or a specialized equine dentist. If horses are kept inside in a barn, they require regular daily exercise for their physical health and mental well-being. When turned outside, they require well-maintained, sturdy fences to be safely contained. Regular grooming {{is also helpful to}} help the horse maintain good health <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> coat and underlying skin.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} revealed fine grooves or striations on the teeth in lemuriform toothcombs. These grooves were only found {{on the sides of}} the teeth on the concave surfaces between the sides, as well on the back ridge of the teeth. Between 10 and 20µm wide, these grooves indicate that hair moved repeatedly across the teeth. Inside these grooves were even finer grooves, less than 1µm, created by abrasion with the cuticular layer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous {{adenitis}} is an {{autoimmune disease}} that affects sebaceous glands. It is mainly known {{to occur in}} dogs, particularly poodles and akitas, where it {{is thought to be}} generally autosomal recessively inherited. It has also been described in cats, and one report describes this condition in a rabbit. In these animals, it causes hair loss, though the nature and distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> loss differs greatly.|$|E
40|$|Cercal hairs {{represent}} in cricket a wind sensitive escape system, able {{to detect}} the airflow generated from predating species. These sensors have been studied as a biomimetic concept to allow <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> MEMS for biomedical use. In particular, <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hairs,</b> including airflow response, resonant frequency and damping, has been investigated up to a frequency <b>of</b> 20 kHz. <b>The</b> microscopic nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hairs,</b> <b>the</b> complex vibrations <b>of</b> excited <b>hairs</b> and <b>the</b> high damping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system suggested that <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> Laser Doppler vibrometry could possibly improve the test performance. Two types of tests were performed: {{in the first case}} <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> were indirectly excited using the signal obtained from a vibrating aluminium plate, whilst in the second case <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> were directly excited using a white noise chirp. The results from the first experiment indicated that <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> move in-phase with the exciting signal up to frequencies in <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> 10 kHz, responding to <b>the</b> vibration modes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plate with a signal attenuation of 12 to 20 dB. The chirp experiment revealed <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> rotational resonant modes at 6850 and 11300 Hz. No clear effect of hair length was perceivable on <b>the</b> vibration response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> filiform sensors. The obtained results proved promising to support the mechanical and vibration characterisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> and suggest that scanning Laser vibrometry can be used extensively on highly dampened biological materials...|$|R

50|$|Because backcombing rubs against <b>the</b> scales <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair's</b> cuticle, it {{can cause}} serious and {{progressive}} damage to <b>the</b> <b>hair's</b> integrity. Over time, this leads to weakening and breakage. It can also cause tangles near the root that {{are very difficult to}} remove. Frequent backcombing is not recommended {{for people who want to}} maintain long hair.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} pathologic {{change is}} {{the formation of a}} plug (a microcomedone), which is driven primarily by excessive growth, reproduction, and accumulation of skin cells in the hair follicle. In normal skin, the skin cells that have died come up to the surface and exit the pore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> follicle. However, increased production of oily sebum in those with acne causes the dead skin cells to stick together. The accumulation of dead skin cell debris and oily sebum blocks the pore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> follicle, thus forming the microcomedone. This is further exacerbated by the biofilm created by P. acnes within the hair follicle. If the microcomedone is superficial within the hair follicle, the skin pigment melanin is exposed to air, resulting in its oxidation and dark appearance (known as a blackhead or open comedo). In contrast, if the microcomedone occurs deep within the hair follicle, this causes the formation of a whitehead (known as a closed comedo).|$|E
5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} (BHD), also Hornstein–Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, Hornstein–Knickenberg syndrome, and fibrofolliculomas with trichodiscomas and acrochordons {{is a human}} {{autosomal dominant}} genetic disorder that can cause susceptibility to kidney cancer, renal and pulmonary cysts, and noncancerous tumors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> follicles, called fibrofolliculomas. The symptoms seen in each family are unique, and can include any combination of the three symptoms. Fibrofolliculomas {{are the most common}} manifestation, found on the face and upper trunk in over 80% of people with BHD over the age of 40. Pulmonary cysts are equally common (84%), but only 24% of people with BHD eventually experience a collapsed lung (spontaneous pneumothorax). Kidney tumors, both cancerous and benign, occur in 14–34% of people with BHD; the associated kidney cancers are often rare hybrid tumors.|$|E
5|$|In {{over one}} or more sittings, a highly skilled {{sculptor}} from Madame Tussauds Studios who is given {{direct access to the}} celebrity will record the colours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> and eyes, and over 500 precise body measurements are referenced. Most important is to capture the look of the celebrity to reflect the personality of each unique individual. The next task is to make a clay model of the head and body which is used to create a mould. Wax cast of the head and hands are made from the mould, and the eyes are inserted. Each eye is hand-painted to achieve a perfect match of the original. Real human hair is then inserted painstakingly strand by strand.|$|E

5|$|It is a small, mouse-like rodent. It {{differs from}} the very similar eastern voalavo mainly in some measurements, such as a greater tail length. It also resembles small species of Eliurus, but the fur is darker {{and there is no}} tail tuft. The fur is soft, short, and thick, and appears dark gray on most of the upperparts, but more {{brownish}} on the sides. On the back, the cover hairs, which form {{the main part of the}} fur, are three-colored: most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> is gray, followed by a narrow light buff band and a black tip. The longer guard hairs are black. The fur of the underparts is not different in overall color, but the individual hairs are gray for about three quarters of their length and white at the tips, except for those at the chin, which are white throughout.|$|E
5|$|Other tumors {{can include}} trichodiscomas (tumors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> disc, {{which may be}} {{identical}} to fibrofolliculomas), angiofibromas, and perifollicular fibromas. However, angiofibromas are more common in tuberous sclerosis. Along with the tumors, other skin conditions are seen in people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. Approximately 40% of people or families with the disease have papules in their mouth, which can be located on the cheeks (buccal mucosa), tongue, gums, or lips. Either white or mucosa-colored, they are discrete, small, and soft and consist of fibrous tissue covered in thickened epithelium. Collagenomas of the skin are also found in some families. Many people with BHD have skin lesions {{that appear to be}} acrochordons (skin tags), but may instead be fibrofolliculomas. These lesions are usually found in the armpit, on the eyelids, and in folds of skin. Not all individuals develop the facial tumors; some families with the mutation that causes BHD develop only kidney tumors or spontaneous pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{initially}} {{hypothesized that}} acne represented {{a disease of}} the skin's hair follicle, and occurred due to blockage of the pore by sebum. During the 1880s, bacteria were observed by microscopy in skin samples affected by acne and were regarded as the causal agents of comedones, sebum production, and ultimately acne. During the mid-twentieth century, dermatologists realized that no single hypothesized factor (sebum, bacteria, or excess keratin) could completely explain the disease. This led to the current understanding that acne {{could be explained by}} a sequence of related events, beginning with blockage of the skin follicle by excessive dead skin cells, followed by bacterial invasion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> follicle pore, changes in sebum production, and inflammation.|$|E

5|$|The six-man {{match at}} SummerSlam was {{originally}} {{supposed to be}} a mixed tag-team match between the team of Tatanka and Sherri Martel and the team of Bam Bam Bigelow and Luna Vachon. However, Luna broke her arm and Sherri left the WWF in July 1993, however, forcing the WWF to change the match. Two reasons have been given for Sherri's departure: her decision to enroll in cosmetology school and failed drug tests. As a result, Tatanka teamed with The Smoking Gunns and Bigelow teamed with The Headshrinkers. The Gunns and Headshrinkers were rivals in the tag team division but had no real storyline. The feud between Bigelow and Tatanka originated When Tatanka came to the help of Sherri, who had interrupted an interview with Bigelow. Subsequently, Bigelow ambushed Tatanka and cut some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> Tatanka had dyed red as a tribute to his Lumbee heritage.|$|E
5|$|This {{analysis}} shows {{that rather than}} fruit body structure, spore size is generally a more reliable character for segregating species groups in Cyathus. For example, species in the ollum clade all have spore lengths less than 15µm, while {{all members of the}} pallidum group have lengths greater than 15µm; the striatum group, however, cannot be distinguished from the pallidum group by spore size alone. Two characteristics are most suited for distinguishing members of the ollum group from the pallidum group: the thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> layer on the peridium surface, and the outline of the fruit bodies. The tomentum of Pallidum species is thick, like felt, and typically aggregates into clumps of shaggy or woolly hair. Their crucible-shaped fruit bodies do not have a clearly differentiated stipe. The exoperidium of Ollum species, in comparison, has a thin tomentum of fine hairs; fruit bodies are funnel-shaped and have either a constricted base or a distinct stipe.|$|E
5|$|The last hearing {{exhausted}} Frank's ordinary state appeal rights. On March 7, 1914, Frank's execution {{was set for}} April 17 of that year. The defense {{continued to}} investigate the case and filed an extraordinary motion before the Georgia Supreme Court. This appeal, which would be held before a single justice, Ben Hill, was restricted to raising facts not available at the original trial. The application for appeal resulted in a stay of execution and the hearing opened on April 23, 1914. The defense successfully obtained a number of affidavits from witnesses repudiating their testimony. A state biologist said in a newspaper interview that his microscopic examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> on the lathe shortly after the murder did not match Phagan's. At {{the same time that}} the various repudiations were leaked to the newspapers, the state was busy seeking repudiations of the new affidavits. An analysis of the murder notes, which had only been addressed in any detail in the closing arguments, suggested Conley composed them in the basement rather than writing what Frank told him to write in his office. Prison letters written by Conley to Annie Maude Carter were discovered; the defense then argued that these, along with Carter's testimony, implicated Conley was the actual murderer.|$|E

40|$|Plucked scalp hairs {{and hair}} roots of pili annulati were {{examined}} {{to understand their}} pathogenesis. Stereoscopic examinations of hairs in transmitted light and/or reflected light and light microscopic surveys <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross-sections <b>of</b> <b>hairs</b> confirmed that <b>the</b> cortical empty spaces appeared {{to be responsible to}} the unique dotted shiny appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> seen by <b>the</b> unaided eyes under a refracted light.
