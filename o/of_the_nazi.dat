5|$|From 1936 to 1945, {{the lion}} {{was once again}} {{replaced}} by an eagle, only this time the one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> party, the Reichsadler. Deemed the Hauptstadt der Bewegung (Capital of the Movement), Munich was a significant place in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> ideology. The city was home to the NSDAP headquarters, the Beer Hall Putsch and also saw the establishment of Dachau, the first Nazi concentration camp. Post-war designs were not pursued until 1949.|$|E
5|$|When Hitler was {{released}} from prison on 20 December 1924, Berchtold was District Director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> Party in Carinthia, Austria and was leader of the SA there. After the re-formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> Party on 20 February 1925, he again joined the party, documented as member #964. In March 1926, Berchtold returned to Munich from Austria. He became chief of the SA in Munich.|$|E

5|$|After the Nazi Party {{seized power}} on 30 January 1933, the black-red-gold flag was swiftly scrapped; a ruling on 12 March {{established}} two legal national flags: the reintroduced black-white-red imperial tricolour and the flag <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> Party.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi anti-tobacco {{campaign}} included banning {{smoking in}} trams, buses and city trains, promoting health education, limiting cigarette rations in the Wehrmacht, organizing medical lectures for soldiers, {{and raising the}} tobacco tax. The National Socialists also imposed restrictions on tobacco advertising and smoking in public spaces, and regulated restaurants and coffeehouses. The anti-tobacco movement {{did not have much}} effect in the early years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> regime and tobacco use increased between 1933 and 1939, but smoking by military personnel declined from 1939 to 1945. Even {{by the end of the}} 20th century, the anti-smoking movement in postwar Germany had not attained the influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> anti-smoking campaign.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} component to the Holocaust in Lithuania {{was that the}} occupying Nazi German administration fanned antisemitism by blaming the Soviet regime's recent annexation of Lithuania, a year earlier, on the Jewish community. Another significant factor was the large {{extent to which the}} Nazis' design drew upon the physical organization, preparation and execution of their orders by local Lithuanian auxiliaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> occupation regime.|$|E

5|$|Caracciola began racing {{while he}} was working as {{apprentice}} at the Fafnir automobile factory in Aachen during the early 1920s, first on motorcycles and then in cars. Racing for Mercedes-Benz, {{he won his first}} two Hillclimbing Championships in 1930 and 1931, and moved to Alfa Romeo for 1932, where he won the Hillclimbing Championship for the third time. In 1933, he established the privateer team Scuderia C.C. with his fellow driver Louis Chiron, but a crash in practice for the Monaco Grand Prix left him with multiple fractures of his right thigh, which ruled him out of racing for more than a year. He returned to the newly reformed Mercedes-Benz racing team in 1934, with whom he won three European Championships, in 1935, 1937 and 1938. Like most German racing drivers in the 1930s, Caracciola was a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> paramilitary group National Socialist Motor Corps (NSKK), but never a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> Party. He returned to racing after the Second World War, but crashed in qualifying for the 1946 Indianapolis 500. A second comeback in 1952 was halted by another crash, in a sports car race in Switzerland.|$|E

As a boy working at his father's equestrian school in Munich, he became a {{proficient}} rider and participated in jumping events. During this period he met Christian Weber, an original member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> Party. Weber later sponsored Fegelein's entry into the Schutzstaffel (SS).|$|E
5|$|From Lemberg to Bordeaux ('Von Lemberg bis Bordeaux'), {{written by}} Leo Leixner, a {{journalist}} and war correspondent, is an eye-witness account of the battles {{that led to the}} fall of Poland and France.

The book was originally issued by Franz Eher Nachfolger, the central publishing house <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> Party.|$|E

5|$|Heydrich was {{assigned}} to help organise the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. The games were used to promote the propaganda aims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> regime. Goodwill ambassadors were sent to countries that were considering a boycott. Anti-Jewish violence was forbidden for the duration, and news stands were required to stop displaying copies of Der Stürmer. For his part in the games' success, Heydrich was awarded the Deutsches Olympiaehrenzeichen or German Olympic Games Decoration (First Class).|$|E

5|$|Racism and {{antisemitism}} were basic tenets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> Party and the Nazi government. Discrimination {{and violent}} attacks against Jews began {{immediately after the}} seizure of power in 1933. Violence and economic pressure were used by the Nazis to encourage Jews to voluntarily leave the country. By 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews had emigrated to the United States, Argentina, the United Kingdom, Palestine, and other countries.|$|E
5|$|Sturmabteilung ("Storm Detachment"; SA) was a {{paramilitary}} organization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> Party {{created in}} 1920 to police party rallies and disrupt their opponents' meetings. By {{the time the}} Nazis seized power in 1933, it had grown to almost four million men. It was commanded by Ernst Röhm, who was shot in 1934 on Hitler's orders after refusing to commit suicide.|$|E

5|$|The letter {{caused a}} stir in the upper echelons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> regime. In his diaries, Joseph Goebbels, Reich Minister of Propaganda, assumed that someone in the German Catholic church {{organisation}} wrote, and distributed, the letter. A bounty of 100,000 Reichsmark, posted by the Führer himself, revealed no clues to its origins. Even the strongest repressive actions could not hinder {{the distribution of the}} letter.|$|E
5|$|The {{small blue}} {{forget-me-not}} flower {{was first used}} by the Grand Lodge Zur Sonne, in 1926, as a Masonic emblem at the annual convention in Bremen, Germany. In 1938 a forget-me-not badge—made by the same factory as the Masonic badge—was chosen for the annual Nazi Party Winterhilfswerk, the annual charity drive of the National Socialist People's Welfare, the welfare branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> party. This coincidence enabled Freemasons to wear the forget-me-not badge as a secret sign of membership.|$|E
5|$|While in Germany, Victoria {{showed an}} {{interest}} in the Nazi Party, which appealed to her because of its anti-Bolshevik stance and her hope that the movement might help restore the Russian monarchy.
