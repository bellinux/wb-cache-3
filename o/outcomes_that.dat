5|$|Survivor Series (1992) was {{the sixth}} annual Survivor Series {{pay-per-view}} (PPV) professional wrestling event {{produced by the}} World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It took place on November 25, 1992, at the Richfield Coliseum in Richfield Township, Ohio. The buildup to the pay-per-view consisted of feuds scripted by the WWF's writers, and the matches that {{took place at the}} event had pre-determined <b>outcomes</b> <b>that</b> had been decided by the company.|$|E
5|$|WrestleMania IX was {{the ninth}} annual WrestleMania {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event {{produced by the}} World Wrestling Federation (WWF). The event took place at Caesars Palace in Paradise, Nevada, on April 4, 1993, {{and was the first}} WrestleMania event held outdoors. The buildup to the pay-per-view consisted of feuds scripted by the WWF's writers, and the matches that took place at the event had pre-determined <b>outcomes</b> <b>that</b> had been decided by the promotion.|$|E
5|$|The {{pay-per-view}} {{also included}} two other title matches. Mr. Perfect lost his WWF Intercontinental Championship to the Texas Tornado, {{who was a}} substitute for Brutus Beefcake, who had been injured in a real-life parasailing accident. The Hart Foundation won the WWF Tag Team Championship from Demolition in a {{two out of three}} falls match. Each of the matches was built up through feuds scripted by the WWF's writers, and the matches that took place at the event had pre-determined <b>outcomes</b> <b>that</b> had been decided by the WWF.|$|E

25|$|Complications of {{hypertension}} are clinical <b>outcomes</b> <b>that</b> result from persistent {{elevation of blood}} pressure. Hypertension is {{a risk factor for}} all clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis since it is a risk factor for atherosclerosis itself. It is an independent predisposing factor for heart failure, coronary artery disease, stroke, renal disease, and peripheral arterial disease. It is the most important risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, in industrialized countries.|$|E
25|$|Orthogonality {{has been}} shown in the history of many industries, {{particularly}} to reflect changing expectations. American hospitals used to measure success by patient outcome. In the early 1900s, however, a study showed such dismal results with patient <b>outcomes</b> <b>that</b> the study and its results were burned, and hospitals instead evaluated performance by the keeping of records and adherence to procedures. With time, societal expectations of low patient mortality have led to hospitals reinstating the patient outcomes as a measure of success.|$|E

50|$|During {{the time}} {{immediately}} following the Common Slavic period, weak yers were gradually deleted. A deleted front yer ь often left palatalization of the preceding consonant as a trace. Strong yers underwent lowering and became mid vowels, but the outcomes differ somewhat across the various Slavic languages. Slovenian in particular retains a distinct <b>outcome</b> <b>that</b> did not merge with any other vowels, and Bulgarian has an <b>outcome</b> <b>that</b> merged only with nasal ǫ.|$|R

25|$|As {{an emotion}} {{regulation}} strategy, people can bet against a desired outcome. A New England Patriots fan, for example, could bet their opponents to win {{to reduce the}} negative emotions felt if the team loses a game. People typically do not bet against desired <b>outcomes</b> <b>that</b> are important to their identity, due to negative signal about their identity that making such a gamble entails. Betting against your team or political candidate, for example, may signal {{to you that you}} are not as committed to them as you thought you were.|$|E
25|$|Sciascia {{wrote of}} his unique Sicilian experience, linking {{families}} with political parties, the treachery of alliances and allegiances, and the calling of favors {{that result in}} <b>outcomes</b> <b>that</b> do not benefit society, but those individuals who are in favor. His books are rarely characterized by a happy ending or by justice for the ordinary man. A prime {{example of this is}} Equal Danger (1973; Uguale pericolo), in which the police's best detective is drafted to Sicily to investigate a spate of murders of judges. Focusing on the inability of authorities to handle such investigation into the corruption, Sciascia's hero is finally thwarted.|$|E

This goes beyond the traditional preoccupation with budgets – how much have we spent so far, {{how much do we}} have left to spend? It is about helping the organization to better understand its own performance. That means making the connections and understanding the relationships between given inputs – the resources brought to bear – and the outputs and <b>outcomes</b> <b>that</b> they achieve. It is also about understanding and actively managing risks within the organization and its activities.|$|E

25|$|On October 15, 2013, Dr. Tewari {{was named}} the Chairman of Urology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Previously he served as Director of the Lefrak Institute of Robotic Surgery, Director of Prostate cancer, {{as well as the}} Director of Robotic Prostatectomy and Prostate Cancer-Urologic Oncology Outcomes at the Brady Urology Foundation of Weill Medical College. He is a tenured Professor of Urology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. In addition, Tewari directs a {{fellowship}} program in Robotic Prostatectomy and Prostate Cancer <b>Outcomes</b> <b>that</b> has conducted research comparing robotic surgery outcomes versus those of laparoscopic and open surgeries.

25|$|Kang, one of {{the major}} thinkers that {{influenced}} Phan, took the idea of Social Darwinism and discussed the survival of the fittest concept as it applied to nations and ethnic groups. He described the dire <b>outcomes</b> <b>that</b> would face China if the country did not embark on a series of reforms, similar to those faced by the Ottoman Empire and colonial India. He believed that reforms made by Peter the Great and Emperor Meiji were excellent examples of the political restructuring that needed to take place to save China. From Kang's work, Phan realized why Emperor Tự Đức's decision to ignore Nguyễn Trường Tộ's proposed modernization reforms had led to the downfall of Vietnam and had allowed for French rule in Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries {{demand for}} Chinese goods (particularly silk, porcelain, and tea) in Europe created a trade {{imbalance}} between Qing Imperial China and Great Britain. European silver flowed into China through the Canton System, which confined incoming foreign trade {{to the southern}} port city of Canton. To counter this imbalance, the British East India Company began to auction opium grown in India to independent foreign traders in exchange for silver, {{and in doing so}} strengthened its trading influence in Asia. The opium was transported to the Chinese coast where local middlemen made massive profits selling the drug inside China. The influx of narcotics reversed the Chinese trade surplus, drained the economy of silver, and increased the numbers of opium addicts inside the country, <b>outcomes</b> <b>that</b> worried Chinese officials.|$|E

40|$|Collaborative {{bargaining}} {{is widely}} used to resolve disputes over policies with multiple attributes. In standard bargaining theory, utility maximizing parties would be predicted to select an <b>outcome</b> <b>that</b> lay within the bargaining lens defined by the government-selected backstop- an <b>outcome</b> <b>that</b> may be sub-optimal. Recent experimental results suggest, however, that bargainers may be egalitarian or concerned to maintain historical entitlements, opening {{the possibility that they}} might select outcomes outside the bargaining lens. In a two-party, two-attribute experiment, in which subjects jointly select from up to 200 options, we find evidence that history matters and that parties are egalitarian...|$|R
25|$|Extrinsic {{motivation}} {{refers to}} the performance of an activity in order to attain a desired outcome and it is the opposite of intrinsic motivation. Extrinsic motivation comes from influences outside of the individual. In extrinsic motivation, the harder question to answer is where do people get the motivation to carry out and continue to push with persistence. Usually extrinsic motivation is used to attain <b>outcomes</b> <b>that</b> a person wouldn't get from intrinsic motivation. Common extrinsic motivations are rewards (for example money or grades) for showing the desired behavior, and the threat of punishment following misbehavior. Competition is an extrinsic motivator because it encourages the performer to win and to beat others, not simply to enjoy the intrinsic rewards of the activity. A cheering crowd and the desire to win a trophy are also extrinsic incentives.|$|E
25|$|The {{measurement}} of critical application characteristics involves measuring structural {{attributes of the}} application's architecture, coding, and in-line documentation, as displayed in the picture above. Thus, each characteristic is affected by attributes at numerous levels of abstraction in the application and all of which must be included calculating the characteristic's measure {{if it is to}} be a valuable predictor of quality <b>outcomes</b> <b>that</b> affect the business. The layered approach to calculating characteristic measures displayed in the figure above was first proposed by Boehm and his colleagues at TRW (Boehm, 1978) and is the approach taken in the ISO 9126 and 25000 series standards. These attributes can be measured from the parsed results of a static analysis of the application source code. Even dynamic characteristics of applications such as reliability and performance efficiency have their causal roots in the static structure of the application.|$|E
25|$|Roughly speaking, the theorem {{states that}} {{although}} there are many series of results that may be produced by a random process, the one actually produced is most probably from a loosely defined set of <b>outcomes</b> <b>that</b> all have approximately the same chance of being the one actually realized. (This is a consequence of the law of large numbers and ergodic theory.) Although there are individual outcomes which have a higher probability than any outcome in this set, the vast number of outcomes in the set almost guarantees that the outcome will come from the set. One way of intuitively understanding the property is through Cramér's large deviation theorem, which states that the probability of a large deviation from mean decays exponentially with the number of samples. Such results are studied in large deviations theory; intuitively, it is the large deviations that would violate equipartition, but these are unlikely.|$|E
