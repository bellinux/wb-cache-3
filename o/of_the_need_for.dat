40|$|The paper, {{which is}} a summary of a longer study, {{presents}} the most important conceptual and methodological approaches to <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> adult education. <b>The</b> conceptual approaches are related to <b>the</b> theoretical treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs,</b> such as <b>the</b> behaviourist and development-humanist theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> applied in psychology, <b>the</b> class-strata <b>needs</b> theory developed by sociologists, {{and an understanding of}} the needs characteristic of marketing. A special chapter considers <b>the</b> applicability <b>of</b> individual conceptual approaches to identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> adult education within higher education. A consequence of multiplicity of conceptual approaches to <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> is a methodological pluralism which becomes evident in empirical work. In the subsequent chapter the author outlines the already established methods <b>for</b> identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> and "a case study" carried out by <b>the</b> researchers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Centre for <b>the</b> Development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University.

5|$|Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol {{because of}} how British social policy treated {{children}} at the time, and wished to use the novella {{as a means to}} put forward his arguments against it. The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children in poverty—personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance. The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers—as was Tiny Tim. Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present his message <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> charity, without alienating his largely middle-class readership.|$|E
5|$|Fay {{damaged the}} roof of the airport's {{terminal}} building, causing the sprinkler system to malfunction and inundate parts of the structure with water; the resultant flooding crippled computer systems crucial to processing passenger information. The airport's radar was also impacted by the storm. In response to the damage, the airport was closed to all flights, though it quickly reopened to emergency diversions and non-commercial flights. Including subsequent damage from Gonzalo, about $2 million was spent on airport repairs, and the storms were later cited as evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a newer terminal in a more protected location.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} {{to found a}} national organization was likely the result of several factors. First, the mainstream trade unions were increasingly reformist and centralized. Second, the localists gained confidence from their involvement in the dock workers' strike in Hamburg in late 1896 and early 1897. Third, loss of membership (for example, the Berlin metal workers rejoined the DMV in 1897) convinced the localists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> action.|$|E

His espousal of science met with clerical opposition; he and Palmerston unsuccessfully recommended a knighthood for Charles Darwin, after the publication of On the Origin of Species, which was opposed by the Bishop of Oxford.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Allogeneic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (SCT) application represents a {{treatment of choice}} that enables <b>the</b> eradication <b>of</b> malignant clone and chance for remedy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients with hematological diseases. Only 30 - 40 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potential patients for allogeneic SCT have an HLA identical sibling, {{due to the fact}} that families in most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> developed countries are relatively small. Material and methods. This study gives a general model <b>for</b> calculating <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> allogeneic SCT which, enables calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> allogeneic SCT per 1 million inhabitants of Vojvodina on basis of number of potential patients who could be treated by allogeneic SCT. <b>The</b> number <b>of</b> beds required for transplanted patients, and of days in hospital per year as well as <b>the</b> estimation <b>of</b> financial aspect of allogeneic SCT, have been calculated by means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cummulative risk method, considering the following parameters: <b>the</b> relative number <b>of</b> patients suffering from ANLL, ALL, CML, CLL and MDS, 45 and 55 years old and younger, total incidence/ 100 000 inhabitants for each investigated disease and <b>the</b> average number <b>of</b> days in hospital of transplanted patients. Results. Total annual <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> allogeneic SCT for the patients suffering from ANLL, ALL, CML, CLL and MDS together, in transplantation with stem cells from their related donors are 786 days, from the unrelated donors are 306 days, while for nonmyeloablative transplantation with stem cells from their related donors are 558 days and from the unrelated ones are 297 days. Conclusion. The general calculating model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> allogeneic SCT could be used as a basis for planning a regional bone marrow donor registry and for creating a similar calculating model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> allogeneic SCT in other diseases treatable by HSCT...|$|R
5|$|Arkansas was {{anchored}} in Casco Bay, Maine, on 7 December 1941, when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor {{and brought the}} United States into the war. A week later, she steamed to Hvalfjordur, Iceland, and returned to Boston on 24 January 1942. She conducted training maneuvers in Casco Bay, to prepare her crew for convoy escort duties. On 6 March, she arrived at Norfolk, to begin overhaul. The secondary battery was reduced to six 5-inch/51 cal guns. Also, 36 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft (AA) guns (in quadruple mounts) and 26 20 mm Oerlikon AA guns were added, the experience at Pearl Harbor having made the US Navy aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> increased light AA armament. The 3-inch/50 caliber gun armament was also increased from 8 guns to 10. Work lasted until 2 July, after which time Arkansas conducted a shakedown cruise in Chesapeake Bay; she then proceeded to New York, arriving on 27 July. There, she became the flagship of Task Force 38 (TF 38), the escort for a convoy of twelve transports bound for Scotland. The convoy arrived in Greenock, on 17 August, and Arkansas returned to New York on 4 September.|$|E
5|$|Congress held {{hearings}} on the two bills {{in the summer of}} 1986. Admiral William J. Crowe Jr., Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, led the Pentagon's opposition to the bills. He proposed, as an alternative, a new Special Operations Forces command led by a three-star general. This proposal was not well received on Capitol Hill—Congress wanted a four-star general in charge to give SOF more clout. A number of retired military officers and others testified in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> reform. By most accounts, retired Army Major General Richard Scholtes gave the most compelling reasons for change. Scholtes, who commanded the joint special operations task force in Grenada, explained how conventional force leaders misused SOF during the operation, not allowing them to use their unique capabilities, which resulted in high SOF casualties. After his formal testimony, Scholtes met privately with a small number of Senators to elaborate on the problems that he had encountered in Grenada.|$|E
5|$|Developed in {{response}} to the American Polaris programme, the Tu-142 grew out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a viable Soviet ASW platform. It succeeded the stillborn Tu-95PLO project, Tupolev's first attempt at modifying the Tu-95 for maritime use. The Tu-142 differed from the Tu-95 in having a stretched fuselage to accommodate specialised equipment for its ASW and surveillance roles, a reinforced undercarriage to support rough-field capability, improved avionics and weapons, and enhancements to general performance. The Tu-142's capability was incrementally improved while the type was in service, eventually resulting in the Tu-142MZ, the final long-range Tu-142 with highly sophisticated combat avionics and a large payload. Tupolev also converted a number of Tu-142s as avionics (Tu-142MP) and engine (Tu-142LL) testbeds.|$|E

These should suit most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> protecting implementations <b>of</b> crypto-algorithms based on elliptic curves...|$|R
5|$|Farmer {{was also}} criticized for his {{management}} of the agriculture department's vehicle fleet. Late in his first term, Farmer had removed the vehicles used by the Agriculture Department from the state fleet, opting to have department officials manage them separately. In 2010, the Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions, a free market think tank, criticized the department's {{management of the}} vehicles under its control, citing {{the frequency with which}} the department's vehicles were being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted in 2010 that the department's fleet had grown from 178 to 206 vehicles since 2007 while the state's fleet had shrunk by 5%, and that all but three of the department's vehicles were fewer than four years old. A department spokesman defended the moves, citing decreased maintenance costs and higher resale values of vehicles being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted that such incidents could undermine Williams and Farmer's traditional Republican message <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> less government spending.|$|E
5|$|From 1788 until 1870 {{the defence}} of the Australian colonies was mostly {{provided}} by British Army regular forces. Originally Marines protected the early settlements at Sydney Cove and Norfolk Island, however they were relieved of these duties in 1790 by a British Army unit specifically recruited for colonial service, {{known as the}} New South Wales Corps. The New South Wales Corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of Irish convicts at Castle Hill in 1804. Soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the War Office <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a more reliable garrison in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. Chief of these shortcomings was the Rum Rebellion, a coup mounted by its officers in 1808. As a result, in January 1810 the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot arrived in Australia. By 1870, 25 British infantry regiments had served in Australia, as had {{a small number of}} artillery and engineer units.|$|E

Patriarch Amalric and Patriarch of Antioch Aimery of Limoges were unable to attend, and William and the other bishops did not have sufficient weight to persuade Pope Alexander III <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a new crusade. William was, however, sent by Alexander as an ambassador to Emperor Manuel, and Manuel then sent him on a mission to the Principality of Antioch. William does not mention exactly what happened during these embassies, but he probably discussed the Byzantine alliance with Jerusalem, and Manuel's protectorate over Antioch, where, due to pressure from Rome and Jerusalem, the emperor was forced to give up his attempts to restore a Greek patriarch. William was absent from Jerusalem for two years, returning home in 1180.|$|E
