She began painting in earnest {{at the age}} of 78 and is often cited as an example of an individual who successfully began a career in the arts at an advanced age. Her works have been shown and sold in the United States and abroad and have been marketed on greeting cards and other merchandise. Moses' paintings are displayed in the collections of many museums. The Sugaring <b>Off</b> <b>was</b> sold for US $1.2 million in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 1819, {{smoke was}} {{observed}} at the mountain. However, this is often not recorded as an eruption as the information was insufficient to identify it as such. Similarly, in 2003, a blowing cloud of snow was mistaken by {{an employee of the}} ConocoPhillips Building in Anchorage for an ash plume. Possible steam-vapor let <b>off</b> <b>was</b> observed in 1933 at the mountain.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} by Takumi Nakazawa, while Kotaro Uchikoshi was the planner and scenario writer. Development began immediately after Uchikoshi's first visual novel, Memories <b>Off,</b> <b>was</b> finished. He was unable to make heavy use of science fiction themes in Never 7, as his superiors at KID {{told him that the}} game needed to include cute girl characters in order to sell; he kept science fiction themes light, and the game was designed with a focus on dating game elements, with the main focus being to develop a relationship with a girl. The Dreamcast version included new scenarios not available in the PlayStation version.|$|E

The aircraft was insured for £2,200,000 with Lloyd's of London.|$|E
5|$|The early European {{settlers}} killed emus {{to provide}} food and used their fat for fuelling lamps. They {{also tried to}} prevent them from interfering with farming or invading settlements in search of water during drought. An extreme example of this was the Emu War in Western Australia in 1932. Emus flocked to the Chandler and Walgoolan area during a dry spell, damaging rabbit fencing and devastating crops. An attempt to drive them <b>off</b> <b>was</b> mounted, with the army called in to dispatch them with machine guns; the emus largely avoided the hunters and won the battle. Emus are large, powerful birds, and their legs are among the strongest of any animal and powerful enough to tear down metal fencing. The birds are very defensive of their young, and there have been two documented cases of humans being attacked by emus.|$|E

50|$|In knitting, binding off, or casting <b>off,</b> <b>is</b> {{a family}} of {{techniques}} for ending a column (a wale) of stitches. Binding <b>off</b> <b>is</b> typically used to define the final (usually upper, taking the cast on edge as the lower) edge of a knitted fabric, although {{it may also be}} used in other contexts, e.g., in making button holes. In principle, binding <b>off</b> <b>is</b> the opposite of casting on, but the techniques are generally not mirror images of one another. Sometimes, however, they can produce a mirror image appearance.|$|R

25|$|Once Colossus {{was built}} and installed, it ran continuously, powered by dual {{redundant}} diesel generators, the wartime mains supply being considered too unreliable.

Each Mk2 consumed 15 kilowatts; most of the power was for the tube heaters.|$|E

25|$|Many {{experts believe}} that the timing, {{which was in the}} very early hours of July 5 in Korea, but midday of July 4 in the United States when space shuttle Discovery was about to lift <b>off,</b> <b>was</b> {{deliberate}} to get attention from the United States, and possibly an attempt for one on one talks rather than the six party talks regarding North Korea's nuclear capabilities.|$|E
25|$|Wu-ti began a {{third phase}} of {{construction}} which peaked on 100BC {{with the construction}} of many new palaces. He also added the nine temples complex south of the city, and built the park. In 120BC, Shanglin Park, which had been used for agriculture by the common people since Liu Bang was sealed <b>off,</b> <b>was</b> turned into an imperial park again. In the center of the park was a recreation of the three fairy islands in Kunming Lake.|$|E
25|$|Skoppum Station, {{where the}} Horten Line {{branched}} <b>off,</b> <b>was</b> given an island platform design, with the station located {{between the two}} tracks. This, {{and the need for}} space for transshipment, gave the station an odd design, and the island location gave it difficult access from the surroundings. Six stations have been listed by the Directorate for Cultural Heritage: Skoppum, Tønsberg, Stokke, Råstad, the goods house at Sandefjord, the engine shed at Larvik Station, Eidanger Station and Borgestad Station.|$|E

25|$|The company {{spun off}} its Travelers Property and Casualty {{insurance}} underwriting business in 2002. The spin <b>off</b> <b>was</b> {{prompted by the}} insurance unit's drag on Citigroup stock price because Traveler's earnings were more seasonal and vulnerable to large disasters, particularly the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in downtown New York City. It was also difficult to sell this kind of insurance directly to customers since most industrial customers are accustomed to purchasing insurance through a broker.|$|E
25|$|Fumito Iwai {{considers}} the songs' arrangements {{to be the}} central part of the songs Folks create. Take <b>Off</b> <b>was</b> created, arranged and mixed by Fumito Iwai alone, using Logic Pro software. Folks' sound has been influenced by Oasis, and English indie rock musicians such as James Blake and Bombay Bicycle Club. Iwai feels influenced by Yuuki Ozaki's lyrical style, and by Galileo Galilei's music after spending two years living with the members. For Newtown, the band felt most influenced by French indie rock band Phoenix's album Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix (2009).|$|E

The first asset {{to be sold}} <b>off</b> <b>was</b> the airline's 50% interest in Falcon Jet Corporation in August. Later in November, Pan Am sold the Pan Am Building to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company for $400million. In September 1981 Pan Am sold off its InterContinental hotels chain. Before this transaction closed, Seawell was replaced by C. Edward Acker, Air Florida's founder and ex-president {{as well as a}} former Braniff International executive. The combined sale value of the InterContinental chain and the Falcon Jet Corp stake was $500million.|$|E

25|$|Tanguy at {{the time}} was married to Jeannette Ducroq, but they were separated, and he and Sage {{immediately}} fell in love. Breton and most of the other Surrealists were much less welcoming. Sage, still well <b>off,</b> <b>was</b> generous with her money, and the group of impoverished artists badly needed such support, but they resented her wealth and what they felt was a haughty attitude that fitted her former title of “Princess” all too well. Her alliance with Tanguy caused a rift between Tanguy and Breton, who had formerly been close friends. Shrugging off this rejection, Sage went on calling herself a Surrealist.|$|E
25|$|On 12 March 2013, an Iranian F-4 Phantom pursued an MQ-1 {{flying over}} the Persian Gulf. The unarmed reconnoitering Predator was {{approached}} by the F-4, coming within 16miles of the UAV. Two U.S. fighters were escorting the Predator and verbally warned the jet, which made the Iranian F-4 break off. All American aircraft remained over international waters. An earlier statement by the Pentagon that the escorting planes fired a flare to warn the Iranian jet was later amended. The Air Force later revealed that the American jet that forced the Iranian F-4 to break <b>off</b> <b>was</b> an F-22 Raptor.|$|E
25|$|After {{leaving office}} Noble {{became a member}} of the Board of Internal Improvements which was tasked with {{overseeing}} the ongoing internal improvements in the state. In 1840, the state ended all funding for the projects. By early 1841 it was clear that the state would not be able to pay even the interest on its debt, and paying it <b>off</b> <b>was</b> out of the question. The board approved the sending of James Lanier to negotiate a bankruptcy with the state's creditors, and all the internal improvement projects, except the separately funded Wabash and Erie Canal, were turned over to the creditors in exchange for a 50% reduction in the state's debt.|$|E
