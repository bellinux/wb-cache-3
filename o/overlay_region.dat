40|$|Ni-based {{superalloy}} weld overlays {{are widely}} used in electricity generating plants to significantly reduce high temperature corrosion problems of ferritic steel components under service conditions. Welding a nickel alloy similar to IN 625 onto the outer bore of a 2. 25 Cr 1 Mo steel tube enhances its service life as a superheater tube in the highly corrosive environment of a Waste-to-Energy boiler. For the purposes of studying the effects of high temperature service on the microstructure of this laid tube with a weld overly, a series of thermal exposure tests at 650 ˚C was performed for different times from 1 day up to 128 days. The microstructural evolution was studied {{using a combination of}} analytical techniques along with changes in hardness profile across the interface. Changes in the microstructure were examined using OM, SEM, EPMA, EBSD and FIB-STEM. Hardness survey results indicate significant changes in the interfacial region during ageing. Formation of a soft zone ~ 300 μm wide and its subsequent re-hardening was observed in the steel side while the hardness of the bulk steel remained unchanged. Development of a hard band ~ 30 μm wide adjacent to the interface in the weld <b>overlay</b> <b>region</b> and hardening of the bulk overlay material occurs {{in the early stages of}} ageing and remained unchanged with ageing time. Thermodynamic calculations were performed using Thermo-Calc software and TCFE 6 and TTNI 7 databases to aid interpretation of experimental data. Microstructural evolution in the steel region is related to the carbide transformation process and carbon migration. In the bulk of the steel tube, the bimodal microstructure is stable and in the tempered martensite/bainite areas, the initial M 3 C transform to M 23 C 6 through a series of metastable carbides while in the ferrite grains, M 2 C carbide precipitates and transforms directly to the equilibrium carbide. The main process for supply of carbon atoms is transformation of carbides and the rates of transformation are related to the as-welded microstructure. On the steel side of interfacial region where bainite was formed after welding, the stability of metastable carbides is related to the carbon content. Long term ageing causes Mo replenishment in the coexisting ferrite and fine grains have formed in this region following long term ageing. Experimental observations confirmed that a network of alloyed M 23 C 6 carbide precipitates was formed at the interface in the steel side which are believed to interrupt the carbon migration across the interface. Moreover, there is a carbide precipitation region within ~ 100 μm from the interface in the weld overlay. Beyond this region intermetallic phases like Mo-rich μ and Nb-rich δ were formed in the interdendritic regions and along the grain boundaries. Hard band formation is related to precipitation of the σ phase. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

30|$|In this article, which {{improves}} the work presented in [22], a general framework for building detection using both building characteristics and contextual information is proposed. This method {{is applied to}} single SAR images and has the following abilities. (1) It is able to detect and segment isolated buildings {{even though they are}} densely distributed. When gray-level values of buildings fluctuate greatly, different parts of a single building can be merged. (2) It is suitable for common buildings with different shapes, either linear or L-shaped. Due to imaging conditions, buildings may differ in shapes in different SAR images. Most common building shapes are linear or L-shaped lines, and the lines can be very thin (only several pixels wide) or with a certain width. Usually, the two situations are dealt with separately by adopting different algorithms. We consider that a method adapted to different building shapes is more flexible in practical applications. (3) It can locate accurate building boundaries. Here boundary means the boundary of a building appearing in SAR image, not the boundary or foot-print in the real world. In some researches, detection is not the final purposes. Detection results provide useful information for building reconstruction or 3 D dimension extraction [23, 24].

In addition, we studied the biases that result from modeling various orders temporal continuity and using various time samplings [5]. the present work, we address computational issues associated with evaluating the statistical uncertainty of spatiotemporal model parameter estimates, and use Monte Carlo simulations to a fast algorithm for computing the covariance matrix for the parameters.

To begin with, we have integrated RNA-Seq and methyl binding domain sequencing (MBD-Seq) data {{in order to determine the}} extent to which DNA methylation affects phenotypic variation in economically important traits of cattle. MBD-Seq is a technique that involves the sample enrichment of methylated genomic regions followed by their next-generation sequencing. This study utilized Illumina next generation sequencing technology to perform both RNA-Seq and MBD-Seq. NextGENe software (SoftGenetics, State College, PA) was employed for quality trimming and aligning the sequence reads to the UMD 3. 1 bovine reference genome, generating counts of matched reads and methylated peak identification. Subsequently, we identified and quantified genome-wide methylated regions and characterized the extent of differential methylation and differential expression between two groups of animals with extreme phenotypes. The program edgeR from the R software package (version 3. 0. 1) was employed for identifying differentially methylated regions and regions of differential expression. Finally, Partial Correlation with Information Theory (PCIT) was performed to identify transcripts and methylation events that exhibit differential hubbing. A differential hub is defined as a gene network hub that is more highly connected in one treatment group than the other. This analysis produced every possible pair-wise interaction that subsequently enabled us to look at network interactions of how methylation affects expression. (co-expression, co-methylation, methylation x expression).

As one moves basally, further into the proximal meristem, and depending on the growth conditions, the redox status becomes more oxidized, with a 5 - 10 mV difference in redox potential between the two borders delimiting the proximal meristem. At the point on the root axis at which cells of the proximal meristem cease division and enter the transition zone, the redox potential levels off and remains more or less unchanged throughout the transition zone. As cells leave the transition zone and enter the zone of elongation the redox potentials become more oxidized. Treating roots with salt (50, 100 and 150 mM NaCl) results in marked changes in root meristem structure and development, and is preceded by changes in the redox profile, which flattens, and initially becomes more oxidized, with pronounced changes in the redox potentials of the root cap, the root cap initials and the quiescent center. Roots exposed to relatively mild levels of salt (< 100 mM) are able to re-establish a normal, pre-salt treatment redox profile 3 - 6 days after exposure to salt. Coincident with the salt-associated changes in redox profiles are changes in the distribution of auxin transporters (AUX 1, PIN 1 / 2), which become more diffuse in their localization.

Results: In OA joints, both subchondral cortical plate and subjacent horizontal trabeculae increase in thickness early, prior to joint space narrowing (JSN). With progression, cortical plate sclerosis increased in 60 % of OA hands and did not change in knee OA until JSN < 1. 5 mm in the medial diseased compartment.

In the progress of post-classification, this error checking mainly depends on manual labour to assure data quality, by which it is time-consuming and labour intensive.

40|$|Purpose To {{identify}} reliable criteria {{based on}} spectral-domain {{optical coherence tomography}} (SD OCT) to monitor disease progression in geographic atrophy attributable to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) compared with lesion size determination based on fundus autofluorescence (FAF). Design Prospective longitudinal observational study. Methods setting: Institutional. study population: A total of 48 eyes in 24 patients with geographic atrophy. observation procedures: Eyes with geographic atrophy were included and examined at baseline and at months 3, 6, 9, and 12. At each study visit best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), FAF, and SD OCT imaging were performed. FAF images were analyzed using the <b>region</b> <b>overlay</b> device. Planimetric measurements in SD OCT, including alterations or loss of outer retinal layers and the RPE, as well as choroidal signal enhancement, were performed with the OCT Toolkit. main outcome measures: Areas of interest in patients with geographic atrophy measured from baseline to month 12 by SD OCT compared with the area of atrophy measured by FAF. Results Geographic atrophy lesion size increased from 8. 88 mm² to 11. 22 mm² based on quantitative FAF evaluation. Linear regression analysis demonstrated that results similar to FAF planimetry for determining lesion progression {{can be obtained by}} measuring the areas of outer plexiform layer thinning (adjusted R 2 = 0. 93), external limiting membrane loss (adjusted R 2 = 0. 89), or choroidal signal enhancement (R 2 = 0. 93) by SD OCT. Conclusions SD OCT allows morphologic markers of disease progression to be identified in geographic atrophy and may improve understanding of the pathophysiology of atrophic AMD...|$|R
40|$|Low {{concentrations}} of (1, 3; 1, 4) -β-ᴅ-glucan are desired in malt/wort created from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) to ensure efficiency during brewing. This goal {{can be achieved}} through low grain β-glucan content, high malt β-glucanase activity, or a combination thereof. Evaluation of these traits is time-consuming and expensive since malting must occur before analysis, thus they are ideal for the identification of associated markers to permit marker-assisted selection. Two genetic mapping approaches were taken to evaluate these traits. First, a bi-parental QTL mapping population was developed from the Western Canadian two-row, spring, hulled varieties CDC Meredith and CDC Kindersley. CDC Meredith has normal to higher grain β-glucan content and higher wort β-glucan content, while CDC Kindersley has normal to lower grain β-glucan content and very low wort β-glucan content. Secondly, a 92 member association mapping (AM) population was assembled consisting of two-row, spring, hulled elite malting breeding lines and varieties derived from eight different barley breeding programs focused on Western Canada. Both populations were grown over a two year period and assessed for kilned malt β-glucanase activity, grain, malt, and wort β-glucan content, plus green malt β-glucanase activity in the AM population. Both populations were genotyped using the Barley 9 K iSELECT Genotyping BeadChip and the QTL population was also genotyped with DArTseq markers. As expected, green malt β-glucanase activity typically had a stronger correlation to malt/wort β-glucan content than did either kilned malt β-glucanase activity or grain β-glucan content. Ten unique QTLs (four for grain β-glucan, two for malt β-glucan, and three for kilned malt β-glucanase) were identified in the QTL population and eight marker-trait associations were identified in the AM population for grain β-glucan, green/kilned malt β-glucanase, or a combination thereof. One common genomic region on chromosome 2 H was identified in both studies which was associated with grain β-glucan content. In the QTL and AM populations, six and five QTLs and marker-trait associations identified were novel, respectively, while the others <b>overlay</b> previously identified <b>regions.</b> In some cases, underlying genes were identified which may explain the observed associations. Lines with high β-glucanase activity and heat stability were identified in the AM population, thus through crossing, lines possessing both of these beneficial traits could be generated. Further trials {{to collect data on}} these traits would be desirable to validate the identified markers and confirm the β-glucanase heat stability data...|$|R
40|$|Signal {{transduction}} is {{a crucial}} event that enables cells to sense and respond to cues from their immediate environment. Guanylyl cyclase C (GC-C) {{is a member of}} the family of receptor guanylyl cyclases. GC-C is a single transmembrane protein that responds to its ligands by the production of the second messenger cGMP. The guanylin family of peptides, (including the bacterially produced heat-stable enterotoxin ST) is the ligand for GC-C, elevates intracellular cGMP levels and activates downstream pathways. GC-C regulates the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) by inducing phosphorylation by protein kinase G, resulting in chloride ion and fluid efflux. GC-C also regulates cell cycle progression through cGMP-gated Ca 2 + channels. These functions are seen in the intestinal epithelium, the primary site for GC-C expression. GC-C as a molecule has been studied in detail, but its functioning in the context of other signaling pathways remains unknown. The aim of the present investigation was to understand the regulation of signal transduction by GC-C and its cross-talk with other signaling pathways operating in the cell. Molecular events that commonly connect components in a signaling pathway are protein phosphorylation and protein-protein interaction. These two aspects are explored in this thesis. The possibility of tyrosine phosphorylation of GC-C has been explored earlier in our laboratory. In vitro studies indicated that the residue Tyr 820 was a site for phosphorylation by the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases and those studies also suggested that phosphorylated Tyr 820 could bind to the SH 2 domain of Src. We generated a nonphosphorylatable mutant of GC-C, GC-CY 820 F, and a phosphomimetic mutant GC-CY 820 E to study the effect of phosphorylation of Tyr 820, on the functioning of GC-C. A stable cell line of HEK 293 :GC-CY 820 F cells was generated and compared with HEK 293 :GC-CWT. Dose response to ST in the two cell lines showed that cGMP accumulation by GC-CY 820 F was greater than that of GC-CWT, although the EC 50 remained unchanged. The phosphomimetic GC-CY 820 E mutant receptor was non-responsive to ST. Further in HEK 293 cells, phosphorylation of GC-CWT by constitutively active v-Src resulted in decreased ST stimulation and this effect of v-Src was reduced with GC-CY 820 F. Inhibition of ST stimulation brought about by v-Src required catalytically active Src, as the kinase inactive v-SrcK 295 R did not inhibit ST stimulation. These results were corroborated by in vitro studies by using the recombinant catalytic domain of GC-C expressed in insect cells and by phosphorylation using a purified kinase, Hck. Observations suggested that phosphorylation of Tyr 820 in the catalytic domain of GC-C compromises the guanylyl cyclase activity of GC-C. T 84 and Caco- 2 colon carcinoma cells endogenously express GC-C. The effect of tyrosine phosphorylation of GC-C was studied by using HgCl 2, a known activator of Src kinases, and by the inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases using pervanadate, an irreversible inhibitor. Both these ways of achieving increased tyrosine phosphorylation resulted in decreased ST-stimulated cGMP production by GC-C, as suggested from v-Src transfection studies. This decrease was reversed by using a Src kinase specific inhibitor PP 2, confirming the role of Src kinases in the inhibition of GC-C activity. Interestingly, in Caco- 2 cells that differentiate in culture, the effect of pervanadate on the inhibition of ST-stimulated GC-C activation was dependent on the differentiation stage. Crypt-like cells showed higher inhibition with pervanadate. As they matured into villus-like cells, the effect of pervanadate on GC-C activation was gradually lost. This effect also correlated with a decrease in the expression of Lck, suggesting that in the context of the intestine there could be differential regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of GC-C along the crypt-villus axis. Intestinal ligated loop assays in rats demonstrated that ST-induced fluid accumulation in the intestine was abrogated on pervanadate treatment. Reduction in this fluid accumulation by pervanadate was not observed with 8 -Br-cGMP, a cell permeable analogue of cGMP. This indicated that tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins is important for ST-induced fluid accumulation, and perhaps pervanadate modulates this by phosphorylation of GC-C, thereby causing a reduction in fluid accumulation. Earlier in vitro studies on Src-SH 2 binding from the laboratory had suggested the possibility of activation of Src family kinases by GC-C. The activation status of Src kinases was monitored by using phosphorylation-state specific antibody, pSFK 416. ST stimulation in T 84 cells increased Tyr 416 phosphorylation of Src kinases in a time dependent manner, indicating that Src kinases are activated downstream of GC-C. This activation of Src kinases was also seen with the endogenous ligand of GC-C, uroguanylin. Interestingly, 8 -Br-cGMP a cell permeable analogue of cGMP that is known to mimic other cellular effects of GC-C, namely Cl-secretion and cell cycle progression, did not activate Src kinases, suggesting that the mechanism of Src kinase activation by GC-C could be independent of cGMP. Binding affinities of Src, Lck, Fyn and Yes SH 2 domains to Tyr 820 phosphorylated GCC peptide were in the nM range, indicating a high affinity of interaction. In vitro GST-SH 2 pull down experiments suggested that phosphorylation of Tyr 820 in full length GC-C allows interaction of GC-C to the SH 2 domain of Src. These studies suggest a dual cross-talk between Src kinases and GC-C; Src phosphorylation inhibits GC-C signaling and stimulation of GC-C by its ligands activates Src kinases. Interaction of proteins containing SH 2 and SH 3 domains are commonly found in signaling molecules. In accordance with the observation that there are three PXXP motifs in GCC, many SH 3 domains could interact with GC-C. GC-C appears to show a preference to bind the SH 3 domains of Fyn, Hck, Abl tyrosine kinases, Grb 2 and Crk adaptor proteins, the α-subunit of P 85 PI 3 kinase, PLC-γ and cortactin to various extents. The SH 3 domains of spectrin and Nck did not show any detectable interaction with GC-C. In SH 3 pull-down assays, the N-terminal SH 3 domain of Crk, CrkSH 3 (N), bound GC-C maximally, suggesting that Crk is a good candidate for interaction with GC-C. By <b>overlay</b> analysis, the <b>region</b> of GC-C that binds CrkSH 3 (N) was narrowed down to the catalytic domain of GC-C containing a ‘PGLP’ motif. Mutations were generated in GC-C at this site to generate GC-CP 916 Q and GC-CW 918 R. These mutations compromised the binding of full length receptor to CrkSH 3 (N). In cells, CrkII and GC-C co-transfection inhibited the ST stimulation of GC-C. A CrkII mutant, that has compromised binding through its SH 3 domain, did not inhibit the activity of GC-C. CrkII from T 84 cells co-immunoprecipitated with GC-C and interestingly, the phosphorylated form of CrkII did not, indicating that GC-C - Crk interaction could be regulated by the phosphorylation of Crk. In summary, this study places GC-C, in the context of tyrosine kinase signaling pathway and interaction with the adaptor protein Crk. These studies suggest that GC-C signal transduction can be altered by cross-talk with other signaling events in the cell. Reversible phosphorylation of tyrosine residues inhibits the activity of GC-C, and this is mediated by Src family kinases. Src kinases themselves are activated on stimulation of GC-C by its ligands, possibly because of SH 2 domain interaction with GC-C. Association of Crk by its SH 3 domain regulates GC-C functioning primarily by inhibiting ST-stimulated cGMP production. This opens up the possibility of GC-C signaling through a multimeric complex involving other binding partners of Crk, and these cross-talks involving GC-C with the two proto-oncogenes, Src and Crk, might have far reaching consequences in the regulation of cellular functions...|$|R
