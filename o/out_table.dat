Nb {{is added}} to C-Mn steels {{in order to use}} the solute drag and/or strain induced {{precipitation}} as a useful tool to condition the austenite in the hot rolling mill and produce during the subsequent cooling a refined ferrite grain size. The highest degree of refinement is obtained in conventional rolling mills by accumulating the deformation in austenite during the last passes, followed by early cooling in the run <b>out</b> <b>table</b> to produce a high density of nucleated ferrite grains. However, the maximum refinement is to a certain extent attenuated due to the ferrite grain coarsening taking place during the transformation.

40|$|Abstract: Pearlitic steels present very {{interesting}} mechanical properties when weldability requirements {{are not too}} severe. Thin gauge pearlitic steels require at least one intermediate annealing treatment between hot rolling and cold rolling. The globularised cementite in medium carbon steels provides then higher ductility, formability and machinability. On the other hand, in-line induction heating devices are now well known as powerful tools to reheat quickly and efficiently steel flat products. Such a reheating device induces pearlite globularisation after transformation on the run <b>out</b> <b>table,</b> and hence the conventional intermediate annealing treatment presently performed could be avoided. This work deals with the microstructural and mechanical changes that occur due to the reheating of different pearlite- ferrite microstructures simulating the conditions of an induction heating device...|$|E

40|$|Virological {{investigations}} {{have been made}} in Mwanza, Republic of Tanzania, East Africa during from June 1966 to March 1967. During the course, 17, 097 mosquitoes belonging to 16 species and 224 bats belonging to 3 species were collected and processed for arbovirus content. An agent isolated from Culex decens was identified to be a strain of H 336 virus (Table 1, 3, 5, 7, 8). Twelve arboviruses were also isolated from the salivary glands of bats (Talbe 2). Two of 10 strains from Tadarida pumila were identified to be Bukalasa Bat virus (Table 4, 6, 7, 9). Another strains including 2 strains from Tadarida condylura await identification. Seventy-eight sera of human beings residing in Mwanza were examined for HI antibodies against 8 different antigens (3 Group A, 4 Group B and Bunyamwera). The incidence was highest with Chikungunya virus (73 %), which was thought to be due to the epidemic of O'nyong-nyong fever in East Africa occurred in 1959. On the other hand, low incidence of Yellow fever antibodies (9 %) was also pointed <b>out</b> (<b>Table</b> 10). One hundred and eighty-two materials, chiefly throat swab, were collected from the patients with fever. These materials were processed for virus isolation by using HeLa cells culture and 20 strains of viruses were isolated up to the present.

The run_before_T 6 is used in the case that zeroleft is greater than 6. Otherwise, the table number is selected based on the zeroleft value. In general, a branch operation is needed to decide whether zeroleft is greater than 6. However, in the proposed design, the I_MIN instruction in Table  1 is used to eliminate the branch operation. In step 2, 10 bits are loaded for consecutive decoding. In step 3, the I_ONERETURN instruction is used to carry <b>out</b> <b>table</b> mapping with all 10 bits for run_before_T 6 and with only 3 bits for the remaining tables.

The time dependent wall temperature was measured using embedded thermocouples and the corresponding wall heat fluxes were estimated through an inverse conduction method. In a recent paper, we showed that cooling rates depend on the subcooled temperature of the jet, the velocity of the jet and the surface-to-jet velocity ratio. Since the initial temperature of the cylinder was higher than the Leidenfrost temperature, we observed all the boiling regimes from film boiling to nucleate boiling. The objectives of this paper are firstly to describe the current conditions which exist in the Run <b>Out</b> <b>Table</b> in hot rolling mills, secondly to review the main experimental studies dedicated to jet cooling which have led to modelling heat transfer in boiling conditions and finally to propose new correlations {{taking into account the}} velocity of the wall...|$|E
