5|$|At the school, the {{fatalities}} {{resulted from}} {{the collapse of a}} concrete block wall. One hallway completely collapsed, trapping many students in the rubble <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> known as 3rd Hall. The tornado at the school was so strong that it tossed and mangled cars in the parking lot, flattened parts of the stadium and tore trees out of the ground. School buses were there for an early dismissal due to the storms at just after 1:00pm, but the tornado hit before the school could be dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Parks and Recreation faced early {{production}} delays because Poehler {{was pregnant}} when she signed on; filming {{had to be}} postponed until she gave birth. Principal photography began on February 18, 2009. The show was filmed in Southern California, and the construction pit featured throughout the season was dug by the episode's producers at an undeveloped property in Van Nuys, a district of Los Angeles. The producers went door-to-door in the neighborhood, seeking residents' permission for the dig. The pit was guarded 24hours a day, and paparazzi regularly came to the set to take photos of the actors during filming. The exterior of the Pawnee government building, and several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> scenes, were shot at Pasadena City Hall. The parks and recreation department interiors, {{as well as the}} Town Hall courtyard, were filmed on a sound stage. The set's windows were outfitted with water systems to simulate falling rain, and the windowsills included fake pigeons. Scenes set in playgrounds and elsewhere outdoors were filmed on location in Los Angeles, and the public forum scenes in the premiere episode were filmed in one of the city's middle schools.|$|E
5|$|During the {{construction}} of residential housing and other buildings on the site in 1988–89, several underground sections of the bunker complex were uncovered by work crews. In April 1988, the East German government allowed several visits to the site by photo-journalists. Water was pumped out of the Vorbunker for four days before access could be made via the underground passageway which led from the Chancellery. The interior floor of the Vorbunker {{was covered with a}} muddy sludge from having been underwater for so many years. Old empty wine bottles were found {{on the floor of the}} kitchen and wine store room. Still present in the room next to the kitchen were the broken frames of the bunk beds used by the Goebbels children. At the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> were the stairs leading down to the Führerbunker. However, the men could go no further than the mid-landing, as the Führerbunker was still underwater and the ceiling beyond the doorway had collapsed due to the demolitions performed in 1947. After these inspections, work crews for the most part removed and destroyed the bunker complex. The Vorbunkers top and external walls were the first structures to be torn down. The construction of buildings in the area around the complex was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and unremarkable. The emergency exit point for the Führerbunker (which had been in the Chancellery gardens) was occupied by a car park.|$|E
50|$|First Day of SchoolThe {{first day}} of school at HB begins with {{students}} meeting in the courtyard while a bagpiper begins to play. At some point, the students begin to exit the courtyard, two by two, beginning with the freshman and ending with the seniors. All Upper School students then file into <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> and are cheered on by all faculty that line <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways.</b> <b>The</b> respective class presidents for each grade carry a flag with their class's graduating year as well as the class color. At the end, the Class Presidents place the flags on the auditorium stage, and this begins the school year.|$|R
50|$|A closet with a {{similarly}} dual-surfaced door is located near <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stairs. <b>The</b> <b>hallway's</b> baseboard is more ornate {{than that in}} the rooms. Between the northeast and southeast bedrooms a door opens to {{the stairs to the}} roof.|$|R
50|$|In 1910, Sultan Abdul Hamid II {{ordered to}} {{reconstruct}} the mosque, renew the wall and build more rooms for students and poor people. These renovations costed 2,300 liras. There were several other reconstructions over the years. The most important ones were in 1918 and 1935, where the old rooms were replaced with bigger new rooms, and 1948, where they renewed the flooring and verses of Al-Fath was written on <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways.</b>|$|R
25|$|At Borg in Norrköping Municipality, Östergötland, a small {{building}} was excavated that had two rooms {{on either side}} of a central hallway. There was a stone foundation interpreted as a hörgr at the far end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> from the entrance. Two amulet rings were found near this and 98 amulet rings and 75 kg of unburned animal bones, including numerous skulls and jawbones, were found in the paved area in front of the entrance, suggesting the building had been used for ritual feasts. In the eleventh century the building and its yard had been covered with a thick layer of gravel and a church erected 100m away.|$|E
25|$|The long {{second floor}} hallway {{is now known}} as the Heritage Gallery. Photographs of graduating classes, portraits of nuns and students, diplomas, and other memorabilia hang in this hallway. At the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> in a former girls' {{dormitory}} room is the Heritage Museum, which documents the history of the Ursulines in Montana and at Ursuline Academy. The museum also contains many Native American beadwork items and dresses donated to the Ursulines by tribes in Montana. Antique clocks, hand-carved chairs, and intricately detailed tables—many made by the sisters at St. Peter's Mission—are also housed in the museum. A painting of St. Peter's Mission by contemporary artist Ralph DeCamp also hangs in the room.|$|E
25|$|Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport {{is built}} {{with only one}} airside hallway for both departing and {{arriving}} passengers. For that reason, security checks are located at gate entrances rather than on a central location. Passport controls are placed on two entrances and the single exit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway.</b> All passengers must pass the passport control, as there are no domestic flights. An additional security check used to exist on the hallway entrance, but it was removed in 2013 as it inconvenienced passengers and was not essential for security. In 2007 the airport prohibited cars parking next to the airport terminal, instead they {{have to use the}} car park provided, {{as a result of the}} 2007 Glasgow International Airport attack.|$|E
50|$|Further {{evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gothic Collegiate style can {{be found}} in <b>the</b> vaulted ceilings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways,</b> and <b>the</b> arched doorways and windows featured throughout the building. As stated on a plaque inside the main entrance, during the 60s a major addition was built which significantly altered <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school. These renovations changed little about <b>the</b> original parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building. Although once grand, over the decades, the facility has fallen into considerable disrepair and is in need of extensive renovation.|$|R

50|$|Highland School was remodeled {{from the}} former Highland Junior High School. <b>The</b> new {{configuration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> has three hallways, a gymnasium, and a football field. The halls are labeled A, B and C, and are quasi-sorted by career-technical academy. For example, the A hall has all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medical classrooms, such as the dental lab located in the vicinity. There are two commons areas: Medford Commons, in which all students congregate and socialize before going to classrooms, and Times Square, where the halls meet.|$|R
25|$|Lanier's campus {{has been}} {{expanded}} numerous times {{since it was}} first built. The most notable expansion was {{the addition of the}} area of the building housing the cafeteria and gymnasium. This expansion has resulted in some quirks in the building that are still visible today, most notably a door leading to stairs to the basement that is only half-exposed above the floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway.</b> These stairs are no longer in service, though the door can be opened even though it's blocked by the hallway floor. Students aren't allowed to open the door and/or go down those stairs. Prior to this expansion, the cafeteria was located where the library is today, on the third floor. A dumbwaiter, located where the elevator is today, carried food to the cafeteria.|$|E
25|$|Inside the school, teacher Dave Sanders had {{successfully}} evacuated {{students from the}} cafeteria; where some of them went up a staircase leading {{to the second floor}} of the school. The stairs were located around the corner from the Library Hallway in the main South Hallway. By now, Harris and Klebold were inside the main hallway. Sanders and another student were down at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> still trying to secure as much of the school as they could. As they ran, they encountered Harris and Klebold, who were approaching from the corner of the North Hallway. Sanders and the student turned and ran in the opposite direction. Harris and Klebold shot at them both, with Harris hitting Sanders twice in the chest but missing the student. The latter ran into a science classroom and warned everyone to hide. Klebold walked over towards Sanders, who had collapsed, to look for the student but returned to Harris up the North Hallway.|$|E
25|$|The home's {{interior}} features 16th, 17th, and 18th century French and English details. The {{building is}} heated by an oil-burning, hot air furnace and contains an Otis passenger elevator and freight elevator. The passenger elevator is wood-paneled and the freight elevator measures 5x4feet (1.5x1.2m) in diameter. The flooring consists {{of black and}} white marble squares and the walls are plastered to simulate limestone. In {{the back of the house}} is a five-bay entrance hall and staircase. The library entrance is located on the right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> and two reception rooms and a lavatory are located on the left side. Near the end of the hall are service rooms, service elevator, dining room (now the ambassador's office), and a breakfast room. A lavatory is located beneath the main staircase. At the end of the hall are two parlors and a large drawing room. The second floor contains three bedrooms, two baths, and a service area. One of the bedrooms, the master suite, contains a separate staircase that gives access to the upper floors. The third floor contains bedroom suites and a playroom in the southeast corner. The fourth floor contains additional bedrooms and servants' quarters.|$|E
25|$|Wiener {{was unable}} to secure a {{permanent}} position at Harvard, a situation he blamed largely on anti-semitism at the university and in particular on <b>the</b> antipathy <b>of</b> Harvard mathematician G. D. Birkhoff. He was also rejected for a position at <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> Melbourne. At W. F. Osgood's suggestion, Wiener became an instructor of mathematics at MIT, where he spent <b>the</b> remainder <b>of</b> his career, becoming promoted eventually to Professor. There is a photograph of him prominently displayed in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways,</b> often used in giving directions.|$|R
40|$|What is <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> longest ladder {{that can}} be carried {{horizontally}} around the right-angled corner, created by hallways of widths a and b? To put it more mathematically, how long a line segment can be manoeuvred around the L-shaped corner? This is The Ladder Problem. The Moving Couch Problem: Given hallways of widths and meeting at a right angle, where, what is the longest rectangular couch of width, where, {{that can be}} manoeuvred around the corner? Similarly, the couch has to be horizontal to the ground. These are the problems we were dealing with. Both were solved in four different ways. The Ladder Problem always results in the same way. On the other hand, the solutions to The Moving Couch Problem are not the same. The first three solutions give us the sixth-degree polynomial and the equation for <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> couch. The fourth solution provides a theorem by which we can calculate <b>the</b> widths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways.</b> <b>The</b> Ladder Problem is a mathematical problem because an infinitely thin ladder does not exist. The Moving Couch Problem is a more useful one. <b>The</b> solutions <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Moving Couch Problem {{can be used to}} help moving furniture in case you have a house or an apartment with rectangular corners where <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> meet. ...|$|R
50|$|A timber stair {{leads from}} <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central <b>hallway</b> and winds {{at the top}} to a first floor space, from which the {{principal}} rooms on this floor are accessed. This stair has square sectioned balusters and a chamfered newel post.|$|R
25|$|On {{the first}} floor are located the parlor, the library, two dining rooms, and the kitchen. One of the dining rooms {{is located in the}} western wing, off <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway,</b> and was used {{primarily}} used by the family for smaller meals like breakfast or tea. The kitchen is also in the wing, directly adjacent to the dining room. The other dining room, located in the front western side of the main house, was used only for formal dinners and as the sitting room where the men would converse after dinner. The fireplace in the room was enclosed in marble when Buchanan bought Wheatland and had a furnace installed. Across the hall, {{on the other side of}} the main house is the parlor, where the women guests would congregate after dinner. The library is located off the hallway in the east wing. The woodwork, doors, a bookcase, and a bookshelf built into the wall were grained to resemble oak. The shelves in the bookshelf no longer exist; but, the backboard of the bookshelf is visible, as is the plaster wall made to resemble wood. Two mahogany bookcases, flanking the fireplace in the library, were furnished by Jenkins and having been sold to each successive owner by the previous one. The library was primarily used by Buchanan as the place to meet with guests.|$|E
500|$|The {{interior}} has {{two distinct}} wings {{with a large}} hallway between them, originally with an iron staircase and a hydraulic ram elevator both leading to the third floor. Each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> on each floor had three doors [...] wide. [...] iron pipes were placed through the walls and floors every thirty feet in order to pipe wine {{from one part of}} the building to another, and {{into and out of the}} building.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene at}} the {{beginning}} of the episode, in which the people of Springfield mob the Kwik-E-Mart, is based on the events of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Todd is wearing a Butthole Surfers shirt; however, the censors only allowed [...] "Buttho Surfers". Jay Sherman from The Critic, who had previously appeared in [...] "A Star Is Burns", can also be seen in the mental hospital repeatedly saying his catchphrase, [...] "It stinks". The small door at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> in Flanders' rebuilt house echoes the improbably small hallway in the film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{exiting the}} elevator, guests enter a hallway within the secret MIB Headquarters.

[...] At the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway,</b> guests overlook the immigration and controls room, with a large video screen broadcasting the training information and alien twins, Bob and Bhnxaxx operating controls. They then move into the weapons room, and finally into the training facility, where a training vehicle awaits. Guests who use an Express Pass skip some rooms and meet the normal riders {{when they see the}} alien twins in the control rooms, then follow the normal riders but in a different path.|$|E
500|$|The {{investigators}} {{ruled out}} common causes of accidental fires, including electrical panels and furnaces. They {{determined that the}} basement level of the home, which contained the furnaces, {{had not been a}} point of origin, though two small orphan fires unconnected to the main burning had occurred in that area. Pour patterns were found on the ground and second floors, indicating that a flammable liquid had been poured there and covered many areas of the ground floor, blocked off the stairway from the second floor to the ground floor, and covered much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> on the second floor. The pour patterns stopped {{at the door of the}} house's master bedroom, but had soaked into carpeting in the hallway leading to the children's bedrooms. Investigators could not determine the precise liquid used as an accelerant, though they proved that a can of gasoline the family kept in a shed had not been used. The amount of accelerant used was identified as between [...] Concluding that the fire was a result of arson, the investigators on October 26 called in a second area task force, this one focused on homicide investigation. On October 27, the district attorney for Johnson County was informed that the investigation was now criminal.|$|E

500|$|Josephine Butler (1828–1906) was an English {{feminist and}} social {{reformer}} in the Victorian era. She was especially {{concerned with the}} welfare of prostitutes although she campaigned on {{a broad range of}} women's rights. In 1864 her daughter Eva fell [...] from the top-floor bannister onto the stone floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> in her home; she died three hours later. The death led Butler to begin a career of campaigning that ran until the end of her life; she later wrote that after the death she [...] "became possessed with an irresistible urge to go forth and find some pain keener than my own, to meet with people more unhappy than myself.... It was not difficult to find misery in Liverpool." [...] Her targets included obtaining the vote, the right to better education and the end of coverture in British law, although she achieved her greatest success in leading the movement to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts, legislation that attempted to control the spread of venereal diseases, particularly in the British Army and Royal Navy. She was also opposed to the forced medical examination of prostitutes—a process she described as [...] "surgical" [...] or [...] "steel rape". Her campaigning led to the suspension of the practice in April 1883, and the Acts were formally repealed in three years later.|$|E
