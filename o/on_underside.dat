500|$|The breed {{has four}} {{recognized}} colours. Cavaliers which have rich chestnut markings on a pearly white background {{are known as}} Blenheim in honour of Blenheim Palace, where John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, raised the predecessors to the Cavalier breed in this particular colour. In some dogs there is a chestnut spot {{in the middle of}} the forehead: this is called the [...] "Blenheim" [...] spot. The Blenheim spot is also known as the mark of the [...] "Duchess Thumb Print", based on the legend that Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough while awaiting news of her husband's safe return from the Battle of Blenheim, pressed the head of an expecting dam with her thumb, resulting in five puppies bearing the lucky mark after news that the battle had been won. Black and Tan are dogs with black bodies with tan highlights, particularly eyebrows, cheeks, legs and beneath the tail. Black and Tan is referred to as [...] "King Charles" [...] in the King Charles Spaniel. Ruby Cavaliers should be entirely chestnut all over, although some can have some white in their coats which is considered a fault under American Kennel Club conformation show rules. The fourth colour is known as Tricolour, which is black and white with tan markings on cheeks, inside ears, [...] on eyebrows, inside legs, and <b>on</b> <b>underside</b> of tail. This colour is referred to as [...] "Prince Charles" [...] in the King Charles Spaniel.|$|E
