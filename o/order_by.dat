Papyrus itself was evidently costly, as there are many instances of its re-use in everyday documents, creating palimpsests. In one case, a Book of the Dead was written on second-hand papyrus.|$|E

Then the Senators consider legislation. They begin with unfinished business from the previous session, then consider legislation and special orders with accompanying reports from committees. At {{the discretion of the}} presiding officer, the Senate may adjourn at any time, unless a majority of members present object to adjournment.|$|E

Northrop {{was reluctant to}} protest perceived favoritism of the F-16 in fear of losing support for the project for the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. Ongoing negotiations with the Royal Moroccan Air Force for 20 F-20s were canceled; along with the small <b>order</b> <b>by</b> Bahrain. Later on, a bribery scandal would emerge from the attempts to market the F-20 to South Korea, leading to several Northrop managers resigning and the reprimanding of chief executive Thomas V.

On July 1, 1925, Fry wrote to Charles Moore, chairman of the Commission of Fine Arts (charged by a 1921 executive <b>order</b> <b>by</b> President Warren G.

Commercial catches were continued until 1965 and whaling stations targeting blues were mainly placed along the Hokkaido and Sanriku coasts.|$|E
