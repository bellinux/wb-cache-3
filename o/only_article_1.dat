5000|$|Let us take <b>only</b> <b>Article</b> <b>1</b> of the Constitution, which says: [...] "The Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia is {{a federal}} {{national}} state of republican structure, a community of peoples enjoying equal rights, who {{on the basis of}} the right to self-determination, including the right to secede, have expressed their will to live together in a federated state."There, that is how national equality is settled here, that is how it is codified and put fully into practice.Further, how is the question of power settled in the Constitution and in practice in this country?In Article 6 it is stated: [...] "In the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia all power derives from the people and belongs to the people. The people exercise their power through the freely elected representative bodies of state authority, from the people's committees which, from the local people's committees up to the assemblies of the people's republics and the People's Assembly of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia originated and developed in the People's Liberation War against Fascism and reaction and which are the basic achievements of that struggle."Consequently, the Constitution has only confirmed, or rather codified, what was won during the war, that is to say the power of the people, the power of a real people's democracy.|$|E

The question of unconstitutionality of <b>article</b> <b>1</b> of law 555 of 1912 was posed [...] "where it does not foresee that the child of an Italian citizen mother having kept her citizenship even after her marriage to a foreigner, also has Italian citizenship". The decision determined that the first clause of <b>article</b> <b>1</b> of this law was in clear contrast with the constitution's articles 3 (first paragraph - equality before the law without regard to sex, etc.) and 29 (second paragraph - moral and juridical parity between spouses). The Constitutional Court not <b>only</b> declared <b>article</b> <b>1</b> of law 555 of 13 June 1912 unconstitutional where it did not foresee the Italian citizenship of the child of an Italian citizen mother; but also article 2 of the same law where it sanctions a child's acquisition of a mother's citizenship only in limited cases, since thereafter those limitations were lifted and mothers could generally pass Italian citizenship to their children.|$|R
40|$|Objective:To {{evaluate}} {{whether there is}} any preference for citing journals from other countries {{to the detriment of}} Brazilian journals, in three Brazilian orthopedics journals.

To avoid applying distorted results of trials clinically, a quality analysis of clinical trials is needed. Materials and Methods: We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about erectile dysfunction (ED) conducted in Korea using Medline and KoreaMed. Quality assessment of selected RCTs was performed using three assessment tools (Jadad scales, van Tulder scale, Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool [CCRBT]). Results: The first RCT about ED conducted in Korea was published in 2002. Since 2002, a total of 20 RCTs have been published in medical journals. Among the 20 <b>articles,</b> <b>only</b> <b>1</b> <b>article</b> was found to have a low risk of bias according to the CCRBT. On the Jadad scale, there were 17 high quality articles, while 19 articles were assessed as high quality by the VTS. Only 2 RCTs described the randomization method adequately. Only 1 RCT presented allocation concealment. Conclusions: A low quality clinical trial could produce errors, and these errors could, in turn, distort {{the results of the}} clinical trial. To avoid applying distorted results of trials clinically, a quality analysis of clinical trials is needed. The quality of RCTs was found to be high because almost all of the selected RCTs were double blinded studies. However, the quality of RCTs wa...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{evaluate}} the reports' qualities which are about randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture treatment on Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Eight databases including The Cochrane Library(1993 -Sept., 2011), PubMed (1980 -Sept., 2011), EMbase (1980 -Sept., 2011), SCI Expanded (1998 -Sept., 2011), China Biomedicine Database Disc (CBMdisc, 1978 -Sept., 2011), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI, 1979 -Sept., 2011), VIP (a full text issues database of China, 1989 -Sept., 2011), Wan Fang (another full text issues database of China 1998 -Sept., 2011) were searched systematically. Hand search for further references was conducted. Language {{was limited to}} Chinese and English. We identified 75 RCTs that used acupuncture as an intervention and assessed the quality of these reports with the Consolidated Standards for Reporting of Trials statement 2010 (CONSORT 2010) and Standards for Reporting Interventions Controlled Trials of Acupuncture 2010 (STRICTA 2010). 24 articles (32 %) applied the method of random allocation of sequences. No article gave {{the description of the}} mechanism of allocation concealment, no experiment applied the method of blinding. <b>Only</b> one <b>article</b> (<b>1.</b> 47 %) could be identified directly from its title as about the Randomized Controlled Trials, and <b>only</b> 4 <b>articles</b> gave description of the experimental design. No article mentioned the number of cases lost or eliminated. During one experiment, acupuncture syncope led to temporal interruption of the therapy. Two articles (2. 94 %) recorded the number of needles, and 8 articles (11. 76 %) mentioned the depth of needle insertion. None of articles reported the base of calculation of sample size, or has any analysis about the metaphase of an experiment or an explanation of its interruption. One (1. 47 %) mentioned intentional analysis (ITT). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The quality of the reports on RCTs of acupuncture for Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy is moderate to low. The CONSORT 2010 and STRICTA 2010 should be used to standardize the reporting of RCTs of acupuncture in future...|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{indicated}} the prognostic and clinicopathological value of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH 1) in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients still remains controversial. Thus we performed this study to clarify the relationship between high ALDH 1 expression in CRC {{and its impact on}} survival and clinicopathological features. Publications for relevant studies in Pubmed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) through April 2015 were identified. <b>Only</b> <b>articles</b> describing ALDH <b>1</b> antigen with immunohistochemistry in CRC were included. The software RevMan 5. 1 was used to analyze the outcomes, including 5 -year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and clinicopathological features. 9 studies with 1203 patients satisfying the criteria were included. The overall rate of high ALDH 1 expression was 46. 5 % by immunohistochemical staining. High ALDH 1 expression as an independent prognostic factor was significantly associated with the 5 -year OS and DFS (OR = 0. 42, 95 %CI: 0. 26 - 0. 68, P = 0. 0004; OR = 0. 38, 95 %CI: 0. 24 - 0. 59, P 60 years old vs. < 60 years old; OR = 1. 11, 95 %CI: 0. 63 - 1. 94, P = 0. 72).

Articles for inclusion were sourced by searching the Academic Search Premier, AMED, Biomedical Reference Collection: Expanded, CINAHL Plus, MEDLINE and SPORTDiscus databases with the key words ‘falls’, ‘prevention’, ‘exercise’ and ‘community’ and via reference lists of relevant <b>articles.</b> <b>Only</b> <b>articles</b> of level <b>1</b> or level 2 evidence (Howick et al. 2011) were included. Other inclusion criteria included recording falls incidence as an outcome measure, examining a community-dwelling population aged 60 years or over and implementing exercise as a single intervention {{in at least one}} group. Exercise programme characteristics from 31 articles were examined according to their frequency, intensity, time and type and their effects on falls incidence were reviewed. Exercising for a minimum of 1 h/week for at least 40 h over the course of an intervention is required to successfully reduce falls incidence. The optimal exercise frequency is three times per week, but the optimal duration per bout remains unclear. Specific balance training of sufficiently challenging intensity is a vital programme component, and strength training is most effective when combined with balance training. Flexibility and endurance training may also be included as part of a comprehensive programme. A combination of group and individual home exercise may be most effective for preventing falls and promoting exercise adherence...|$|R
