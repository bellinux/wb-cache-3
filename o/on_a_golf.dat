5|$|An avid golfer {{and tennis}} player, Graham partnered with New York Yankees great Joe DiMaggio in {{numerous}} golf tournaments later in life. He retired {{to a house}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> course in Florida. Graham overcame colon cancer in 1977, but was later plagued by heart ailments and other health problems. He was diagnosed as being {{in the early stages}} of Alzheimer's disease in 2001, and died of a heart aneurysm in Sarasota, Florida, on December 17, 2003. He had two sons and a daughter with his wife Beverly.

5|$|As a pupil at Dunfermline High School, Liddell studied chemistry, mathematics, physics, English and {{two other}} languages. He became a {{reluctant}} rugby player, {{under the guidance of}} retired Welsh international Ronnie Boon, while playing football for local teams and Scotland Schoolboys. By the age of 16, Liddell had progressed sufficiently to earn a contract with Lochgelly Violet football club and be sought after by Liverpool, Hamilton Academical, and Partick Thistle. Liverpool manager George Kay became interested in signing Liddell on the recommendation of the club's Scottish defender Matt Busby, who learned of the teenager from Manchester City's Alex Herd while <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> trip. Herd had forwent one of their rounds to take Willie McAndrew, manager of Hamilton, to watch Liddell play for Lochgelly. When Busby queried him about his absence and Liddell, Herd told him that a contract had not been agreed because limited resources prevented Hamilton from offering Liddell the assurances his parents insisted upon. Instead, Liddell signed for Liverpool as an amateur on 27 July 1938 and became a professional in 1939 on a weekly wage of £3. Negotiations between his parents and the club guaranteed, as a pre-requisite to acceptance, that Liverpool would permit Liddell to continue his accountancy studies, be housed in suitable accommodation, and be employed part-time an accountant at a company in the club's city.|$|E

5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) celebrates his winning of the Vice President {{position}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> outing with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Robert California (James Spader), and Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). After playing, Robert tells Jim that he dislikes {{the business}} plan for the Sabre store, citing the poor quality of the products; he only approved it because Jo Bennett wanted it, but he plans to sandbag it at a high-level meeting, and Jim is stunned when Robert strongly hints {{he is going to}} fire Dwight over it. Jim makes several attempts to stop Dwight from attending the meeting with Robert, but Dwight is heedless and continually insults Jim, who finally decides to leave Dwight to his fate. However, a guilt-inducing phone call to Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) makes Jim decide he has to keep parsing Dwight's insults until he directly tells him {{that he is going to}} lose his job. Dwight ignores the news, thinking Jim is jealous of him, so Jim resorts to wrestling with Dwight outside the conference room. In the meantime, Nellie has Todd Packer (David Koechner) stand in as VP in Dwight's absence. When Dwight makes it into the conference room, he hears Robert planning to fire the VP, so he sneaks out of the conference room and lets Packer take the fall in front of those present. Dwight then silently extends a hand to Jim, and they head back to Scranton with Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), who has reverted to his old grumpy self over the thought of leaving Florida.|$|E

500|$|The soundtrack {{and musical}} score for Uyarndha Manithan were {{composed}} by M. S. Viswanathan, while the lyrics {{were written by}} Vaali. The soundtrack was released under the label of Saregama. Vaali worked on the film alongside Adimaippen (1969) and felt that working on two films simultaneously was [...] "torrid". In the composition and picturisation for the song [...] "Andha Naal Gnaabagam", Viswanathan was inspired {{by one of the}} songs in My Fair Lady (1964), in which Rex Harrison sings with a walking stick in hand <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> course. Due to T. M. Soundararajan's laughter being inadequate during the recording of this song, Viswanathan himself recorded his own laughter. M. Saravanan, in his book AVM 60 Cinema, described the use of dialogues in [...] "Andha Naal Gnaabagam" [...] as [...] "something new to Tamil cinema".

500|$|Howe favoured {{as quick}} a {{transition}} to a peacetime economy as possible. Most industries in which there were not shortages were released from government controls in late 1945. Labour leaders, fearing unemployment, wanted to keep wartime government plants in production; Howe opposed such proposals. When union members who were laid off from the Research Enterprises Limited (R.E.L.) confronted Howe <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> course, the minister stated, [...] "R.E.L. was a war-time plant. The war is through, the plant is through, and your union... what happens to your union is up to you. Get the hell off of the course." [...] In disposing of redundant government property, Howe found that saddles and harnesses had been stored {{since the end of}} the Boer War and men had been employed to safeguard and polish them for over 40 years. He strove to eliminate such anachronisms. [...] However, Howe was slower to release economic controls. According to Roberts, [...] "although he worked to return the country's economic power to private hands, he often seemed as loath to surrender his own dictatorial powers over it as he was to submit to Parliament". [...] In November 1945, Howe's wartime portfolio was merged into his new responsibility to form the Department of Reconstruction and Supply.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of spring training for the 1963 season, Umbricht noticed a small black mole in his right leg, near the thigh while <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> outing with Richards. Umbricht ignored the mole at first, but it grew at a rapid pace. Richards and team trainer Jim Ewell told Umbricht to have it checked by a doctor. A three-inch section of the mole was removed for testing and a doctor confirmed it was a [...] "black mole" [...] tumor that had spread to his groin area. Ewell, the team trainer said, Umbricht [...] "had the most wonderful attitude of anyone you'll ever meet". Umbricht's cancer diagnosis shocked baseball and made national headlines. On March 7, Umbricht underwent a six-hour operation using perfusion [...] to remove the tumor from his right leg. The perfusion technique was radical at the time, entering use as a surgical procedure not long before Umbricht's surgery. After a month-long hospital stay, Umbricht and his doctors told the media that he beat the cancer, crediting [...] "early detection and good physical condition", further stating that he [...] "should have five or six good years left" [...] in his baseball career. However, Umbricht learned that the doctors were unsure if the cancer surgery was a success, or {{even if it had}} been completely removed from his body. Even if it was, his chance of survival was slim at best. Upon hearing the news, Umbricht decided to keep it a secret outside his immediate family.|$|E
