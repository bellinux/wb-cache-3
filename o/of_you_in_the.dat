We {{have created}} {{you out of}} male and female and {{constituted}} you into different groups and societies, so that you may come to know each other-the noblest <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sight of God, are the ones possessing taqwā." [...] In Islam, according to eminent theologians such as Al-Ghazali, although events are ordained (and written by God in al-Lawh al-Mahfūz, the Preserved Tablet), humans possess free will to choose between wrong and right, and are thus responsible for their actions; the conscience being a dynamic personal connection to God enhanced by knowledge and practise of the Five Pillars of Islam, deeds of piety, repentance, self-discipline and prayer; and disintegrated and metaphorically covered in blackness through sinful acts. Marshall Hodgson wrote the three-volume work: The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization.|$|E
