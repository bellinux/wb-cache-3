5000|$|The job {{involves}} patrolling {{stores in}} the role of an <b>ordinary</b> shopper, <b>watching</b> for shoplifters. The detective observes any shopper behaving suspiciously and keeps a mental record of such observations. The objective of the Store Detective is to observe a complete crime taking place. They achieve this by observing a shoplifter approaching an item, appropriating the item (picking it up), concealing the item (not always) and leaving the store having not paid for said item. The key difference between a store detective and a security guard is that the former's role is covert. If they observe an individual shoplifting, they may detain them as they attempt to exit the store or apprehend the suspect(s) during the theft. Laws vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regarding what constitutes the crime of shoplifting and how a suspect may be detained/arrested. In Canada, detectives may arrest the individual utilizing powers given to them by the Criminal Code.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} parallel {{data extraction}} from the quasi–parallel corpora generated in a crowd-sourcing project where <b>ordinary</b> people <b>watch</b> {{tv shows and}} movies and transcribe/translate what they hear, creating document pools in different languages. Since {{they do not have}} guidelines for naming and performing translations, it is often not clear which documents are the translations of the same show/movie and which sentences are the translations of the each other in a given document pair. We introduce a method for automatically pairing documents in two languages and extracting parallel sentences from the paired documents. The method consists of three steps: i) document pairing, ii) sentence pair alignment of the paired documents, and iii) context extrapolation to boost the sentence pair coverage. Human evaluation of the extracted data shows that 95 % of the extracted sentences carry useful information for translation. Experimental results also show that using the extracted data provides significant gains over the baseline statistical machine translation system built with manually annotated data.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{construction}} of social responsibility {{in a sample of}} articles taken from The Universe, a popular Catholic newspaper, in the late 1990 s. It explores the representation of society, agency, voice, and social responsibility in a selection of articles dealing with social issues. The analysis identifies the principal social actors referred to in the texts; which of these are constructed as playing active roles; which are given voice; and for what purposes this voice is used. A distinctive pattern of construction of social responsibility is identified, in which there are three main groups of social actors: those who need help; those who {{are in a position to}} provide help (principally Governments, politicians, and multinational organisations); and those who speak on behalf of the former to the latter (principally Church organisations). I argue that this constructs a representation of the world in which the power and responsibility to act for change is largely held by elite groups, and the role of activist organisations is largely to appeal to the powerful to change things. <b>Ordinary</b> people <b>watch</b> this happening, and those disadvantaged groups who are acted for in these texts have little or no voice or active agency...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — It is a {{well known}} fact that women’s {{empowerment}} is the key for the world development. Now a day’s women’s are facing more troubles physically in countries like India. The main reason {{for this type of}} troubles is the lack of safety for women from the government. But can’t provide safety to every woman. It can only provide some safety measures. It is the duty of every woman to prevent them. But they are not physically stronger than men. Hence additional equipments are needed for the women to protect themselves. The main aim of our project is to design an electric shock antenna watch in which <b>ordinary</b> <b>watch</b> is fitted with antenna on its side which is actuated by small push button. The end of the antenna will be given electric shock so that when they are in danger, they can use its help. At the same time, the sms informer is connected to the button so that when the antenna is actuated, the sms will be sent automatically to the nearest police station so that they can reach the spot quickly. To prevent the miscellaneous activities, these watches should be distributed under government license...|$|E

Odevom chcem zistiť, či sú digitálne zariadenia dostatočne vyspelé na to, aby rozpoznali človeka aj v prípade keď bude mať končatiny navyše a zahalenú tvár s viditeľnými očami. V mojej práci využívam viaceré digitálne zariadenia, ktorými zisťujem účinnosť vytvoreného odevu. Pre porovnanie a lepšie zameranie človeka som ušila odevy dva.

40|$|The {{mining and}} burning of coal is driving {{dangerous}} global warming which threatens to kill our magnificent Great Barrier Reef and endangers the 69, 000 Australian jobs it supports.   Australian coal exports are directly harming our precious Reef, and robbing our {{children of their}} future. The Reef has been hit by the worst ever mass coral bleaching, with 93 % of reefs affected.  Scientists estimate that 50 % of bleached coral may die. If we don’t keep global warming below 1. 5 degrees, the best science tells us we will lose our precious coral reefs completely. The Greens want to ensure a bright future for the reef and coal communities, by making sure coal companies pay for the damage they are doing. That money can be reinvested into the Reef and clean energy projects creating new, long-term jobs under our plan to Renew Australia.
