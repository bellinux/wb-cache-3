She also holds a shakti and hala (plough). Such a Varahi sculpture is found at Abanesi, depicted with the dancing Shiva. She may also be depicted holding a child sitting <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> like Matrikas are often depicted.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} was widely {{influential in the}} 15th and 16th centuries. The set piece of Van Eyck's enthroned Virgin, with a distracted Child <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> was both widely copied, and became a standard for the following 150 years. There are numerous surviving contemporary close and free copies, the most significant {{of which is the}} Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp. Adriaen Isenbrandt included van der Paele's head in his Mass of St Gregory of 1550.|$|E
5|$|A {{few feet}} {{to his right}} sits his wife, darning the clothes <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> and those sprawled on the floor, while a crying infant, who is upset and hungry, goes {{unattended}} in the only bed. Next to the poet's wife, by the open door, an angry milkmaid presents her substantial bill, demanding payment for milk, underlining the poet's refusal to provide for his family by getting himself a proper job. The cupboard stands open and empty, save for a mouse; near the door, a dog steals {{the last of the}} family's food from a plate.|$|E

5|$|The Child has curly {{blond hair}} and sits on a white cloth, {{animated}} and upright, {{at the side of}} the Virgin's lap. Like Mary, his body is shown frontally, his head in three quarters view. He reaches for what seems to be a parrot perched <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> At some point the Child's nudity was covered up; this overpaint was removed during a late 20th-century restoration. He is intended to represent both the host and Eucharist, common allusions in Early Netherlandish art and reflecting that the panel was intended for the celebration of mass.|$|E
5|$|The Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele {{is a large}} oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} completed around 1434–36 by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. It {{shows the}} painting's donor, Joris van der Paele, within an apparition of saints. The Virgin Mary is enthroned at {{the centre of the}} semicircular space, which most likely represents a church interior, with the Christ Child <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> St. Donatian stands to her right, Saint George—the donor's name saint—to her left. The panel was commissioned by van der Paele as an altarpiece. He was then a wealthy clergyman from Bruges, but elderly and gravely ill, and intended the work as his memorial.|$|E
5|$|The chancel {{contains}} memorials to the Lords Stanley of Alderley. The {{memorial to}} John Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley of Alderley contains his effigy dressed in peer's robes lying under a canopy {{with his hand}} on a book, dated 1856 and by Richard Westmacott. On {{the other side of the}} chancel is a memorial to his son Edward Stanley, his effigy holding a scroll in his hand and with a dog at his feet. Engraved in brass on the side of the memorial are the figures of his widow and children. Lady Stanley is seated in the middle with their four surviving sons on her right, five surviving daughters on her left and three children who had died at a young age at her knee and <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> A memorial tablet to John Constantine Stanley, who died in 1878, is by Joseph Boehm.

5|$|A statue by {{sculptor}} Daniel Chester French called Alma Mater {{is centered}} {{on the front steps}} of Low Memorial Library. McKim, Mead & White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library {{in the center of the}} campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing sapientia and doctrina. A book signifying knowledge, balances <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden in the folds of her gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a Royalist institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. & Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the Columbia University protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired. The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a women's college.|$|E

25|$|Early veneration of Mary is {{documented}} in the Catacombs of Rome. In the catacombs paintings show the Blessed Virgin with her son.

In the process, she spilled the entire cup of coffee <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> Liebeck was wearing cotton sweatpants; they absorbed the coffee and held it against her skin, scalding her thighs, buttocks, and groin.|$|E
25|$|The {{predecessor}} of {{the medieval}} bestiary, compiled in Late Antiquity and known as Physiologus (Φυσιολόγος), popularized an elaborate allegory in which a unicorn, trapped by a maiden (representing the Virgin Mary), stood for the Incarnation. As soon as the unicorn sees her, it lays its head <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> and falls asleep. This became a basic emblematic tag that underlies medieval notions of the unicorn, justifying its appearance in every form of religious art. Interpretations of the unicorn myth focus on the medieval lore of beguiled lovers, whereas some religious writers interpret the unicorn and its death as the Passion of Christ. The myths refer to a beast with one horn {{that can only be}} tamed by a virgin; subsequently, some writers translated this into an allegory for Christ's relationship with the Virgin Mary.|$|E

The final four-lap average of 227.004 mph put her in the fourth starting position. Many feel that if not for the mistake <b>on</b> the first <b>lap,</b> <b>her</b> speed would have been sufficient to secure the pole position.|$|R
