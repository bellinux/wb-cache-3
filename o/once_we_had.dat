[...] And they liked that idea and they said, 'Okay. Go write it.' <b>Once</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a basic story, I started {{cataloging}} the strange coincidences in my own life. [...] For example, I was in the Vancouver airport waiting for a flight when John Denver came on over the loudspeaker. I remember saying to myself, 'Hey, he just {{died in a plane crash}} – that's a little weird.' [...] We wrote that version of that experience into the script." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{choosing}} {{candidates for}} the Tatsunoko and Capcom character rosters, the development team was free to nominate any character it wished. However, the team faced limitations on its Tatsunoko candidates; Niitsuma explained, [...] " [...] had to consider licensing issues. <b>Once</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> that list we {{had to figure out}} how to make a balanced fighting game. On top of that we wanted a good balance between male and female characters." [...] Selection emphasis was placed on main characters, rather than on villains. Certain characters were denied by Tatsunoko Production without explanation to Capcom. [...] "We weren't privy to a lot of their decision making process. They didn't share a lot of reasons with us. When they said no and we asked why, they wouldn't tell us, but would give us another suggestion," [...] Niitsuma said. They disallowed characters from Genesis Climber MOSPEADA or Samurai Pizza Cats, despite the high number of fan requests for the latter. The eponymous characters of Tatsunoko's Muteking, The Dashing Warrior and Nurse Witch Komugi were among those planned for inclusion, but were eventually scrapped. The finalized Tatsunoko cast consists of characters that the team enjoyed in their youth. The development team hoped to include Capcom's Phoenix Wright and Franziska von Karma from the Ace Attorney series, but, while the latter's use of a whip made her easy to incorporate, the team struggled to find appropriate attacks for Phoenix. Since Phoenix doesn't move from the waist down in his original game environment, the team considered adding tires to his desk and having the entirety move as a single character. However, this was abandoned due to potential collision issues. Though they envisioned an attack that used his catch-phrase [...] "", with the letters themselves used to attack the opponent, they found that localization would have changed the Japanese four-character phrase (in kanji) to a ten-letter word in English, unbalancing the game. Arthur from Ghosts 'n Goblins, and Ingrid from Capcom Fighting Evolution were also scrapped.|$|E

2500|$|On March 16, 2006, the Dixie Chicks {{released}} the single [...] "Not Ready to Make Nice" [...] {{in advance of}} their upcoming album. [...] Written by the Dixie Chicks and songwriter Dan Wilson, it directly addressed the political controversy that had surrounded the group for the previous three years. Robison said, [...] "The stakes were definitely higher on that song. We knew it was special {{because it was so}} autobiographical, and we had to get it right. And <b>once</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> that song done, it freed us up to do the rest of the album without that burden." [...] She said writing the song had become their [...] "therapy", since they had to hold in so many stored emotions for so long. Thus, the band considered the album not so much political as very personal.|$|E
