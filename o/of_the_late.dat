5|$|Beginning {{with the}} funerary stelas for {{officials}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> Third dynasty, {{small amounts of}} biographical detail were added next to the deceased men's titles. However, {{it was not until}} the Sixth dynasty that narratives of the lives and careers of government officials were inscribed. Tomb biographies became more detailed during the Middle Kingdom, and included information about the deceased person's family. The vast majority of autobiographical texts are dedicated to scribal bureaucrats, but during the New Kingdom some were dedicated to military officers and soldiers. Autobiographical texts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Late</b> Period place a greater stress upon seeking help from deities than acting righteously to succeed in life. Whereas earlier autobiographical texts exclusively dealt with celebrating successful lives, Late Period autobiographical texts include laments for premature death, similar to the epitaphs of ancient Greece.|$|E
