5|$|Boletus subluridellus is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{and grows}} {{in association with}} deciduous trees, especially oak (genus Quercus). Fruit bodies grow scattered or in groups {{on the ground in}} deciduous <b>or</b> <b>mixed</b> forests, and appear from July to October. An eastern North American species, the mushroom is found from New England west to the Great Lakes, north to Quebec in Canada.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} applications, {{hydrogen}} is used pure <b>or</b> <b>mixed</b> with nitrogen (sometimes called forming gas) as a tracer gas for minute leak detection. Applications {{can be found}} in the automotive, chemical, power generation, aerospace, and telecommunications industries. Hydrogen is an authorized food additive (E 949) that allows food package leak testing among other anti-oxidizing properties.|$|E

5|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach was}} probably {{the first to be}} employed, since it is comparatively easy to destroy weeds by burning them or ploughing them under, and to kill larger competing herbivores. Techniques such as crop rotation, companion planting (also known as intercropping <b>or</b> <b>mixed</b> cropping), and the selective breeding of pest-resistant cultivars have a long history.|$|E
5|$|The innate flavour of {{the dried}} tea leaves is {{determined}} by the type of cultivar of the tea bush, the quality of the plucked tea leaves, and the manner and quality of the production processing they undergo.

5|$|According {{to their}} shared {{physical}} and chemical properties, the elements can be classified into the major categories of metals, metalloids and nonmetals. Metals are generally shiny, highly conducting solids that form alloys {{with one another and}} salt-like ionic compounds with nonmetals (other than the noble gases). The majority of nonmetals are coloured or colourless insulating gases; nonmetals that form compounds with other nonmetals feature covalent bonding. In between metals and nonmetals are metalloids, which have intermediate <b>or</b> <b>mixed</b> properties.|$|E
5|$|Although still mainly bred in the Kathiawar peninsula, it is {{also found}} in the Maharashtra and Rajasthan states. The Kathiawari Horse Breeders' Association {{maintains}} a register. The Gujarat government maintains stud farms in eleven different locations; one in Junagadh holds both mares and stallions and is tasked with preserving the breed, while the other ten hold Kathiawari stallions that are used for improving the local stock of other <b>or</b> <b>mixed</b> breeds. In 2007, only about 50 Kathiawaris were held by private breeders.Today, the Panchaal region is renowned for its Kathiawari horses, often producing the most beautiful horses of the breed.|$|E
5|$|Arak is a Levantine {{alcoholic}} spirit (~40–63% Alc. Vol./~80–126 proof) {{from the}} anis drinks family, common in Israel {{and throughout the}} Middle East. It is a clear, colorless, unsweetened anise-flavored distilled alcoholic drink (also labeled as an Apéritif). It is often served neat <b>or</b> <b>mixed</b> with ice and water, which creates a reaction turning the liquor a milky-white colour. It is sometimes also mixed with grapefruit juice to create a cocktail known as 'Arak eshkoliyyot', literally 'Arak grapefruit'.|$|E

All four awards were won by Ratatouille. It was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at the 65th Golden Globe Awards, the BAFTA for Best Animated Film, and the Producers Guild Award for Animated Theatrical Motion Picture. It also received nominations for the Satellite Award for Best Animated <b>or</b> <b>Mixed</b> Media Feature, the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Animated Feature, and the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Animated Feature.|$|E

Taurus–Littrow {{was selected as the}} Apollo 17 landing site after the other candidates were eliminated for various reasons. The landing site was chosen with the objectives of sampling highland material and young volcanic material in the same location.|$|E
5|$|For {{a general}} system, states are {{typically}} not pure, but instead are represented as statistical mixtures of pure states, <b>or</b> <b>mixed</b> states, given by density matrices: self-adjoint operators of trace {{one on a}} Hilbert space. Moreover, for general quantum mechanical systems, {{the effects of a}} single measurement can influence other parts of a system {{in a manner that is}} described instead by a positive operator valued measure. Thus the structure both of the states and observables in the general theory is considerably more complicated than the idealization for pure states.|$|E

5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Hygrocybe appalachianensis grow singly, in groups, or {{clusters}} on the ground. Like all Hygrocybe species, the fungus {{is believed to}} be saprophytic, meaning it obtains nutrients by breaking down organic matter. It fruits in deciduous <b>or</b> <b>mixed</b> forest, typically appearing between the months of July and December. Its range covers a region extending from the states Ohio and West Virginia south to South Carolina and Tennessee. Its occurrence is occasional to locally common.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{the role}} of Metrovías was lessened to simply {{operating}} the lines, while maintenance of infrastructure became the responsibility of SBASE. The relationship between Mauricio Macri's mayoral administration and Metrovías became increasingly strained, with the Government of Buenos Aires issuing multiple fines to the operator. The relationship was further strained in 2013 when Metrovías' 20-year concession ended and has since been renewed on a year-by-year basis, leaving {{the door open for}} a state-run <b>or</b> <b>mixed</b> operation. Among the public, privatisation has proved unpopular, with a survey carried out in 2015 indicating that 82% of passengers would like the Underground to be operated by the state instead of a private company.|$|E
5|$|Substrate {{and product}} {{inhibition}} is where either the substrate or {{product of an}} enzyme reaction inhibit the enzyme's activity. This inhibition may follow the competitive, uncompetitive <b>or</b> <b>mixed</b> patterns. In substrate inhibition there is a progressive decrease in activity at high substrate concentrations. This may indicate the existence of two substrate-binding sites in the enzyme. At low substrate, the high-affinity site is occupied and normal kinetics are followed. However, at higher concentrations, the second inhibitory site becomes occupied, inhibiting the enzyme. Product inhibition is often a regulatory feature in metabolism and can {{be a form of}} negative feedback.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} is {{the most}} widespread member of its genus, breeding in temperate woodlands across Eurasia from Ireland to Japan. It prefers mature trees, and in most of Europe, where it shares its range with short-toed treecreeper, {{it tends to be}} found mainly in coniferous forest, especially spruce and fir. However, where it is the only treecreeper, as in European Russia, or the British Isles, it frequents broadleaved <b>or</b> <b>mixed</b> woodland in preference to conifers.|$|E
5|$|The colony's first directors, Heuveldorp and G. Kruger, were of European <b>or</b> <b>mixed</b> descent. They were {{followed}} by ethnic Chinese soon after, when Nelson Wong made his debut in 1928 with Lily van Java; other Chinese directors included Lie Tek Swie (1929), Wong's brothers Joshua and Othniel (1930), and The Teng Chun (1931). Ethnic Chinese directors dominated the colony's cinema {{for the remainder of}} its existence. The first native director, Bachtiar Effendi, made his debut in 1932 with the talkie Njai Dasima; another native director would not appear until Andjar Asmara and Rd Ariffien made their debuts in 1940.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} B.curtisii grow singly, scattered, {{or in small}} groups {{on the ground in}} {{coniferous}} <b>or</b> <b>mixed</b> woods, often with pines. Fruit bodies generally appear from August to November. The geographical distribution of the fungus is limited to eastern and southern North America. In the United States, it occurs from New England south to Florida, and west to Texas. The species was newly reported from Mexico in 2001.|$|E
