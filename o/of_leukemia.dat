5|$|Marrow {{or blood}} is {{examined}} under light microscopy, {{as well as}} flow cytometry, to diagnose the presence <b>of</b> <b>leukemia,</b> to differentiate AML from other types <b>of</b> <b>leukemia</b> (e.g. acute lymphoblastic leukemia - ALL), and to classify the subtype of disease. A sample of marrow or blood is typically also tested for chromosomal abnormalities by routine cytogenetics or fluorescent in situ hybridization. Genetic studies may also be performed to look for specific mutations in genes such as FLT3, nucleophosmin, and KIT, which may influence {{the outcome of the}} disease.|$|E

40|$|The {{etiology}} <b>of</b> <b>leukemias</b> cannot entirely {{be explained}} by known risk factors, including ionizing radiation, benzene exposure, and infection with human T cell leukemia virus. A number of studies suggested that diet influences the risk <b>of</b> adult <b>leukemias.</b> However, results have been largely inconsistent. We examined the potential association between dietary factors and risk <b>of</b> <b>leukemias</b> among participants <b>of</b> the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study. Among the 477, 325 participants with mean follow-up of 11. 34  yr (SD = 2. 47), 773 leukemias (373 and 342 cases of lymphoid and myeloid leukemia, respectively) were identified. Diet over the previous 12 mo was assessed at baseline using a validated country-specific dietary questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to explore the association between dietary factors that have previously been associated with leukemia risk, including red and processed meat, poultry, offal, fish, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, and seeds/nuts, and risk of both lymphoid and myeloid leukemias. No significant associations were observed between dietary measures and total, lymphoid, and myeloid leukemias. Additional subtype analyses showed no dietary association with risk of major subtypes <b>of</b> <b>leukemias.</b> In summary, {{this study did not}} support a possible link between selected dietary factors and risk <b>of</b> <b>leukemias...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{chromosome}} pattern <b>of</b> <b>leukemias</b> {{induced by}} gamma-irradiation in the translocation T 190 /tf {{and in the}} genetically related tf/tf strain was analyzed. The degree of variation in chromosome numbers was similar in both experimental groups. Karyotypically, the tumors of both strains showed slight and less frequent higher degree of variability. The most consistent karyotypic change was trisomy of chromosome 15, whose frequency was similar in both strains. In one <b>of</b> the <b>leukemias</b> a marker chromosome derived by translocation involving chromosome 15 was identified. Comparison of the breakpoint in this translocation with literature data on other translocations of chromosome 15 found in leukemias enabled narrowing the region on chromosome 15 containing the postulated genes essential for murine leukemogenesis.

40|$|Abstract. The {{hematopoietic cells}} in blood and/or bone marrow from 20 leukemic dogs and 22 control dogs were {{characterized}} using {{a battery of}} cytochemical stains. The results of cytochemical staining led to modification of the diagnoses based on clinical, hematologic and histologic findings in seven (35 %) <b>of</b> the <b>leukemias.</b> Sudan black B and chloroacetate esterase served as granulocytic markers in both the control and leukemic groups. Peroxidase activity was present in the granulocytes and monocytes of control animals but not the blasts of leukemic dogs. Alkaline phosphatase-positive staining of granulocytic precursors was a consistent finding in granulocytic and myelomonocytic leukemia, and alkaline phosphatase-positive lymphoblasts were seen in 38 % <b>of</b> lymphocytic <b>leukemias.</b> Diffuse alpha naphthyl butyrate esterase-positive staining marked monocytes in both control and leukemic dogs. Cytochemical staining {{was found to be}} a valuable diagnostic aid in the classification <b>of</b> <b>leukemias</b> in the dog. The neoplastic cell type in the majority <b>of</b> <b>leukemias</b> in dogs can be classified with Wright-Giemsa stained blood and bone marrow films.

40|$|Conventional {{treatment}} <b>of</b> acute <b>leukemia</b> {{involves the}} use of cytotoxic agents (chemotherapy), but other strategies have been explored. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic have clearly been effective in the treatment <b>of</b> acute promyelocytic <b>leukemia</b> (APL), which creates the possibility that other types <b>of</b> acute <b>leukemia</b> can be conquered by selectively inducing differentiation and/or apoptosis. A great number of investigations have been performed to elucidate the mechanisms and search for effective agents in the treatment of other types <b>of</b> acute <b>leukemia</b> by these new strategies. Progress at the molecular level has been achieved in explaining the mechanisms of action of ATRA and arsenic compounds, and several new agents have emerged, although their clinical effectiveness remains to be confirmed. Mechanism-/gene-based targeted therapy and a combination of different strategies will improve the treatment <b>of</b> acute <b>leukemia.</b> Selective induction <b>of</b> differentiation and apoptosis is a new strategy in the treatment <b>of</b> acute <b>leukemia.</b> Suc-cessful treatment <b>of</b> acute promyelocytic <b>leukemia</b> (APL) with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic compounds prompts us to further investigate, particu-larly at the molecular level, the mechanism of differen-tiation and apoptosis and to seek new differentiation-and apoptosis-inducing agents. 1 The {{purpose of this article is}} to review the state-of-the-art in this area...|$|R
