5|$|The Crown was at {{the centre}} of {{government}} in late medieval Scotland. The unification of the kingdom, the spread of Anglo-Norman custom, {{the development of a}} European trading economy and Robert I's success in achieving independence from England, all did much to build up the prestige of the institution. However, its authority within the kingdom was not unchallenged, not least from the many semi-independent lordships and it endured a series of crisis, particularly frequent minorities and resulting regencies. All of this, in addition to the relative poverty of the kingdom and the lack of a system of regular taxation, helped to limit the scale of central administration and government. Much more than the English monarchy, the Scottish court remained a largely itinerant institution, with the king moving between royal castles, particularly Perth and Stirling, but also holding judicial sessions throughout the kingdom, with Edinburgh <b>only</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> emerge as the capital in the reign of James III at the cost of considerable unpopularity. Like most western European monarchies, the Scottish Crown in the 15th century adopted the example of the Burgundian court, through formality and elegance putting itself at the centre of culture and political life, defined with display, ritual and pageantry, reflected in elaborate new palaces and patronage of the arts.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{sought to}} erect a new {{building}} to address the increasingly cramped conditions of the original Boylston Street campus located near Copley Square, in the increasingly fashionable and crowded Back Bay neighborhood of Boston. Because the stipulations of the original land grant prevented MIT from covering more than two-ninths of its current lot, Walker announced his intention to build the industrial expansion on a lot directly across from the Trinity Church fully intending that expected opposition would lead to favorable terms for selling the proposed land and funding construction elsewhere. With the financial health of the Institute <b>only</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> recover, Walker began construction on the partially-funded expansion, fully expecting the immediacy of the project to be a persuasive tool for raising its funds. The strategy was only partially successful, as the 1883 building had laboratory facilities that were second-to-none but also lacked the outward architectural grandeur of its sister building and was generally considered an eyesore on its surroundings. Mechanical shops were {{moved out of the}} original Rogers Building in the mid-1880s to accommodate other programs, and in 1892 the Institute began construction on another Copley Square building.|$|E

25|$|The book {{is set in}} {{the year}} 2025, after the world's climate has {{recovered}} from the devastation of the meteors. The political geography of the time is dramatically different from our own world, and innovations such as the airplane and combustion engine are <b>only</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> reach prominence. The Angrezi Raj (formerly the British Empire), centered in its former colonies in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans, is the most powerful nation on Earth. It stands alongside other surviving world powers, including France-outre-mer (a European-settled North Africa), the Caliphate of Damascus (a united Middle East), the Empire of Dai-Nippon (a Japanese-ruled China and Far East), and the Russian Empire (a remnant of the original, now located in central Asia).|$|E

25|$|Phil {{clashes with}} Sharon when she {{continually}} puts her work at The Albert before their relationship, <b>only</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> {{become more involved}} with the bar when she is unimpressed at his {{lack of interest in}} her work. Closing up one night after an event, two men break in and vandalize the bar, and when Sharon attempts to defend herself alone, she is severely beaten and left for dead. She is later hospitalised with a ruptured spleen, leaving Phil distraught, but he later admits to Shirley that he arranged for the men to scare Sharon at the bar, but believed the bodyguards that he hired for her would have protected her, and did not realise that she would be hurt. When Shirley confesses she still loves Phil, he spurns her advances and instead proposes marriage to Sharon after she regains consciousness. Unaware of Phil's role in her attack, Sharon accepts, but she later overhears the truth and begins plotting against him with Marcus Christie's (Stephen Churchett) help. However, she later changes her mind and asks Marcus to return all Phil's money to his accounts, unaware that Phil has seen them. After meeting with his accountant, Phil is angry and tells Shirley what he has discovered only for their conversation to turn to passion. However, Phil later decides that since Sharon is returning the money, it should not matter to him as he still wants to go through with the wedding. They later marry, but are oblivious to Shirley's bitterness, as she attempted to persuade him to be with her, rather than Sharon, only hours before the wedding. After the reception, Shirley enters their house and confronts them, leaving Sharon devastated when she realises Phil has been cheating behind her back even after he asked her to marry him. However, she decides that she still loves Phil and wants to be with him. After Phil insults Shirley and makes hurtful remarks about the fling they had together, an enraged Shirley attempts to go for him, but Sharon stops her, and after a brief struggle, Phil is accidentally shot. He is then rushed to hospital, Shirley fleeing {{with the help of her}} aunt, Babe Smith (Annette Badland). When Ronnie discovers her gun was used after Shirley stole it, Ronnie asks Jay and Ben to dispose of it.|$|E
500|$|Carson {{attempted}} {{to leave the}} Bureau (by then transformed into the Fish and Wildlife Service) in 1945, but few jobs for naturalists were available as most money for science was focused on technical fields {{in the wake of}} the Manhattan Project. In mid-1945, Carson first encountered the subject of DDT, a revolutionary new pesticide (lauded as the [...] "insect bomb" [...] after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki) that was <b>only</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> undergo tests for safety and ecological effects. DDT was but one of Carson's many writing interests at the time, and editors found the subject unappealing; she published nothing on DDT until 1962.|$|E
500|$|Inspired by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's {{idea that}} geniuses are self-taught, Wollstonecraft chose a rational, self-taught heroine, Mary, {{as the central}} {{character}} of her novel. [...] Helping to redefine genius (a word which {{at the end of}} the 18th century was <b>only</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> take on its modern meaning of exceptional or brilliant), Wollstonecraft describes Mary as independent and capable of defining femininity and marriage for herself. It is Mary's [...] "strong, original opinions" [...] and her resistance to [...] "conventional wisdom" [...] that mark her as a genius. Making her heroine a genius allowed Wollstonecraft to criticize marriage as well: geniuses were [...] "enchained" [...] rather than enriched by marriage.|$|E

The mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far back into the abyss of time; and whilst we listened with earnestness and admiration to the philosopher who was now unfolding to us the order and series of these wonderful events, we became sensible how much further reason may sometimes go than imagination may venture to follow."

500|$|For most of {{the medieval}} era, the king was {{itinerant}} and had no [...] "capital" [...] as such. David I (r. 1124–53) tried to build up Roxburgh as a royal centre, but in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, more charters were issued at Scone than any other location. Other popular locations {{in the early part}} of the era were nearby Perth, Stirling, Dunfermline and Edinburgh. In the later Middle Ages the king moved between royal castles, particularly Perth and Stirling, but also holding judicial sessions throughout the kingdom, with Edinburgh <b>only</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> emerge as the capital in the reign of James III at the cost of considerable unpopularity.

For example, The Daily Telegraph published an article recommending its readers to try out everything from K-Pop to [...] "K-Cars", [...] "K-Phones" [...] and [...] "K-Cuisine". The British multinational grocery and retailer Tesco reported that its total sales of Korean food had more than doubled {{as a result of the}} popularity of [...] "Gangnam Style". Kim Byoung-gi, the Korean Ambassador to Lebanon, wrote that [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] has helped bridge Lebanese and Korean cultures. The French-born political commentator Tim Soutphommasane, a Research fellow at Monash University, agrees that the Gangnam phenomenon is [...] "something worth studying".

2500|$|Genes can {{be viewed}} as nodes in the network, with input being {{proteins}} such as transcription factors, and outputs being the level of gene expression. The value of the node depends of a function which depends in the value of its regulators in previous time steps (in the Boolean network described below these are Boolean functions, typically AND, OR, and NOT). These functions have been interpreted as performing a kind of information processing within the cell, which determines cellular behavior. The basic drivers within cells are concentrations of some proteins, which determine both spatial (location within the cell or tissue) and temporal (cell cycle or developmental stage) coordinates of the cell, as a kind of [...] "cellular memory". The gene networks are <b>only</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> be understood, and it is a next step for biology to attempt to deduce the functions for each gene [...] "node", to help understand the behavior of the system in increasing levels of complexity, from gene to signaling pathway, cell or tissue level.|$|E
