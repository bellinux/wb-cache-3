Wastewater receives secondary treatment, including basic disinfection with chlorine. 6. 2 Capacity and Use in South Florida South Florida has six publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities that discharge treated municipal wastewater to the ocean. These six facilities are the Miami-Dade Central District, Miami-Dade North District, City of Hollywood, Broward County, Boca Raton, and Delray Beach facilities (Figure 6 - 1). All six facilities discharge secondarytreated wastewater effluent into the western portion of the north-flowing Florida Current.

40|$|This paper gives {{results from}} a study {{measuring}} the abundance of steroid hormones in ocean sediments in the proximity of a deep <b>ocean</b> sewage <b>outfall.</b> The outfall is discharge point for an enhanced primary sewage treatment plant and sediment samples were taken adjacent and 7 km from the outfall. All samples contained steroid estrogens at nanogram per gram levels with higher concentrations at the 7 km sampling site. The concentration of estrone ranged from (0. 16 – 1. 17 ng/g), 17 β-estradiol (0. 22 – 2. 48 ng/g) and the synthetic 17 α-ethinylestradiol (< 0. 05 – 0. 5 ng/g). The values detected correspond with estimates based on the proportion of estrogens sorbed to particles in the effluent and the expected proportion of particles originating from sewage in the ocean sediments. The results suggest that estrogens associated with the particulate fraction aggregate on contact with high ionic strength seawater and settle to the seafloor after discharge through deep <b>ocean</b> <b>outfalls...</b>|$|R

40|$|Aerial {{photography}} {{taken of}} waste plumes from Kraft pulp mill <b>ocean</b> <b>outfalls</b> {{was shown to}} be an effective tool in the study of waste disposal sites. This technique is not limited by sea conditions and permits monitoring and evaluation of outfall sites throughout the year. Photography taken at one instant provides comprehensive information throughout the waste field. Manpower requirements and costs for this method are considerably less than for conventional boat sampling surveys. Field studies were conducted on the waste plumes from Kraft pulp mill <b>ocean</b> <b>outfalls</b> at Newport and Gardiner, Oregon and Samoa, California. Waste concentrations were measured by conventional boat sampling techniques while aerial photography was taken of the outfall area from altitudes ranging from 3, 000 to 11, 000 ft. Computerized procedures were used to compute water currents, waste concentrations, toxicity zones and diffusion coefficients from the photography. The highest concentration measured directly over the outfalls was 2. 3 percent waste by volume and the maximum area of influence with concentrations greater than 0. 2 percent waste was 155 acres. The maximum concentration determined over the outfall for each field study was generally less than that shown to have a detrimental effect on young salmon for a 14 -day exposure. Surface water current was found to be the dominant factor in the resulting plume pattern. During periods of low current velocities in the receiving water, the hydraulic head created by the effluent source was a significant factor in the resulting plume shape. The steady state form of the Fickian diffusion equation and unidirectional transport velocity was not applicable to the majority of the observations. Temperature was found not {{to be an effective}} tracer for tracking the plume or for estimating waste concentrations since the resulting plume temperature may be greater than, {{less than or equal to}} the surrounding ocean temperature...|$|R

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. A Coastal Zone Surveillance Program {{has been developed}} in which systematic comparisons of early ERTS- 1 images and recently acquired images are regularly made to identify areas where changes have occurred. A methodology for assessing and documenting benefits has been established. Quantification of benefits has been directed toward four candidate areas: shore protection, <b>ocean</b> <b>outfalls,</b> coastal land resources, and offshore waste disposal. A refinement in the change detection analysis procedure has led to greater accuracy in spotting developmental changes in the Coastal Zone. Preliminary conclusions drawn from the Shore Erosion case study indicate that in the northern test area (developed beach) erosion has occurred more often, is generally more severe, and the beach is slower to recover than in the southern test area (natural beach). From these data it appears {{that it may be}} possible to define areas most likely to experience further erosion. The assumption of continued erosion in areas that have at one time experienced severe erosion is supported by the simple fact that as a beach narrows wave energy is concentrated on a narrower beach surface. The higher energy condition subsequently results in accelerated erosion...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1963 This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to provide information}} needed {{in the design of}} <b>ocean</b> <b>outfalls.</b> A review of past investigations concerning forces on submerged objects is presented. Objects independent of any boundary and cylinders in boundary contact are considered. A solution for pressure distribution about a circular cylinder resting on a flat boundary in an oscillatory fluid is derived. The energy equation is used as a framework for this derivation. The G. B. Airy (1845) equations of particle motion in waves are used with potential flow theories. The resulting pressure distribution equation considers differences in water level with the passing wave and differences in orbital motion of the water particles referenced to depth above the boundary. This pressure distribution equation does not include viscous or inertial effects on the cylinder. The derived pressure distribution equation is programmed for digital computer solution. Dimensionless ratios between the measured horizontal force on the cylinder and wave characteristics are organized. Correlation between these dimensionless ratios indicates an increase of force with an increase in wave height for any given depth, although data scatter is present. The pressure distribution equation is integrated graphically and the resulting net force differs from the corresponding experimental force by 16 percent to 70 percent...|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic {{nutrients}} {{have been}} shown to provide significant sources of nitrogen (N) that have been linked to increased primary production and harmful algal blooms worldwide. There is a general perception that in upwelling regions, the flux of anthropogenic nutrient inputs is small relative to upwelling flux, and therefore anthropogenic inputs have relatively little effect on the productivity of coastal waters. To test the hypothesis that natural sources (e. g., upwelling) greatly exceed anthropogenic nutrient sources to the Southern California Bight (SCB), this study compared the source contributions of N from four major nutrient sources: (1) upwelling, (2) treated wastewater effluent discharged to <b>ocean</b> <b>outfalls,</b> (3) riverine runoff, and (4) atmospheric deposition. This comparison was made using large regional data sets combined with modeling on both regional and local scales. At the regional bight-wide spatial scale, upwelling was the largest source of N by an order of magnitude to effluent and two orders of magnitude to riverine runoff. However, at smaller spatial scales, more relevant to algal bloom development, natural and anthropogenic contributions were equivalent. In particular, wastewater effluent and upwelling contributed the same quantity of N in several subregions of the SCB. These findings contradict the currently held perception that in upwelling-dominated regions anthropogenic nutrient inputs are negligible, and suggest that anthropogenic nutrients, mainly wastewater effluent, can provide a significant source of nitrogen for nearshore productivity in Southern California coastal waters...|$|R

40|$|Time series {{analysis}} and model simulations defined dynamics of coastal boundary layer formation off Coffs Harbour based on four deployed acoustic Doppler current (ADCP) meters and wind data from Coffs Harbour airport. Variance preserving spectra revealed peak energies at 7. 8, 3. 9 and 2. 5 days plus ~ 24 and ~ 12 hours consistent with dominant forcing by winds. At inshore sites the highest energy levels {{occurred at the}} surface and decrease uniformly with depth at all frequencies with local peaks centred at exactly 24 hours, corresponding to peak local wind energy. In contrast, offshore sites showed depth dependency in the peak spectral energy with evidence of regional influences and wave-guide effects due to density stratification. Hydrodynamic simulations using the 3 -dimensional explicit finite difference model 3 DD revealed local bathymetric controls on circulation. A coastal boundary layer, delineated by a shear zone ~ 2 km offshore {{in the lee of}} Corambirra Point, south of Coffs Harbour, was associated with formation of transient eddies. Model simulations and independent ADCP data identified 3 dimensional flow structures typified by clockwise rotation of flows down through the water column at all sites except for the quiescent, shallow water site in the headland wake south of Corambirra Point. The area south of Corambirra Point was predisposed to clockwise eddy rotation while offshore flows were generally shore-parallel. Pollutant dispersal was shown to be significantly less within this coastal boundary layer thus highlighting the need to consider effects of coastal boundary layers when locating discharges such as <b>ocean</b> <b>outfalls...</b>|$|R
40|$|Taxa {{richness}} and abundance are given for benthic infauna collected from sediments adjacent to <b>ocean</b> <b>outfalls</b> of the Northern District and Agana (Hagatna) Sewage Treatment Plants, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands. This addresses U. S. Environmental Protection Agency requirements of 301 (h) waiver permits for baseline data {{prior to the}} construction of two new outfalls to replace those currently in operation. Living infauna and sediment-surface-dwelling epifauna were collected with a remote sampler from stations off the Agana and Northern District outfalls. Samplings were done in August 2005, March 2006, and January 2007 at depths of 40 to 92 m. A total of 21, 058 invertebrates were collected from both outfall areas over the three sampling years. Polychaetes were the most diverse and abundant component in the three sets of samples, with 9, 068 individuals belonging to 229 taxa. Overall, polychaetes were more abundant off Northern District (5, 489 individuals) than off Agana (3, 579 individuals). Thirty-nine taxa (totaling 11, 990 individuals) of other invertebrates were recorded: Anthozoa, Acari, Bryozoa, Cephalochordata, Chaetognatha, Crustacea (9 taxa), Echinodermata (4 taxa), Hemichordata, Hydrozoa, Insecta, Kinorhyncha, Mollusca (5 taxa), Nematoda, Nemertea, Oligochaeta, Phoronida, Platyhelminthes, Porifera, Priapula, Pycnogonida, Sipuncula, Urochordata, and Osteichthyes (a vertebrate chordate). Nematodes were abundant at both sites in the three samplings (4, 605 individuals), but the Northern District locality had twice the number (3, 053 individuals) of the Agana locality (1, 552 individuals). Patterns of polychaete adundance and taxa richness were similar at both sites. Comparing the results of the three samplings revealed that both sites have diverse infaunal communities and that many species are common to both areas. Small differences between stations and samplings may be due to a number of factors, including reproductive events and the additional habitat provided to carbonate borers by coral rubble, shell fragments, and calcareous algae (Halimeda spp.).
