50|$|Riesman et al. {{identify}} and analyze three main cultural types: tradition-directed, inner-directed, and <b>other-directed.</b> They trace {{the evolution of}} society from a tradition-directed culture, one that moved in a direction defined by preceding generations. Tradition-directed social types obeyed rules established {{a long time in}} the past and rarely succeeded in modern society, with its dynamic changes. This earliest social type was succeeded by people who were inner-directed. They discovered the potential within themselves to live and act not according to established norms but based on what they discovered using their own inner gyroscope. Inner-directed people live as adults what they learned in childhood, and tend to be confident, sometimes rigid. After the Industrial Revolution in America had succeeded in developing a middle-class state, institutions that had flourished within the tradition-directed and the inner-directed social framework became secondary to daily life. Instead of living according to traditions, or conforming to the values of organized religion, of the family, or societal codes, the new middle class gradually adopted a malleability in the way people lived with each other. The increasing ability to consume goods and afford material abundance was accompanied by a shift away from tradition or inner-directedness. How to define one's self became a function of the way others lived.|$|E

First, participants judged self-directed acts as primarily impure and <b>other-directed</b> acts as primarily harmful. Second, conservatism predicted harsher judgments of self-directed but not <b>other-directed</b> acts.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} {{to determine whether or not}} there is anxiety change during periods of unstructured time in people who were identified and classified as inner-directed and <b>other-directed</b> individuals. The intent was also to examine the relationship between self-concept and anxiety change in the two classifications. The research was planned to examine three hypotheses. A t test was administered for significance of difference in anxiety change between the inner- and <b>other-directed</b> classifications, and correlation coefficients were established in order to examine the relationship between anxiety and self-concept in the two classifications. The data used in this study were collected from the test results on the modified scale from the Personal Orientation Inventory (POI), the scores from the pretests and posttests of the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (TMAS), and the scores from the Tennessee Self Concept Scale (TSCS). The TMAS was administered to 28 participants in an unstructured workshop on creativity on the first day and again on the afternoon of the fourth day when the workshop was completed. The TSCS and the modified scale from the POI were administered on the second day. The 28 subjects included 8 men and 20 women employed by the Louisville Board of Education. Administrators, teachers, social workers, and paraprofessionals volunteered for this experience. They ranged in age from 18 to 55. Subjects scoring in the upper two quartiles on the modified inner- and <b>other-directed</b> POI scale were classified as inner-directed; whereas those scoring in the lower two quartiles were classifed as <b>other-directed.</b> Two pilot studies were conducted with this modified scale previous to its use on this study. Hypothesis # 1 was examined by comparing the means of the anxiety change scores which were taken from the TMAS pretests and posttests. A t test was administered for significance of difference between the two means of the TMAS pretest and posttests and was significant at the. 05 level of confidence. Hypotheses # 2 and # 3 were examined by using a correlation co-efficient on the anxiety change scores and the Total P scores from the T SCS. The r's were examined, but the relationship between anxiety change and the self-concept scores of this population were not significant in either classification. The self-concept of the inner-directed, however, was significantly higher than the self-concept of the <b>other-directed.</b> The inner-directed subjects dropped significantly in anxiety scores after the unstructured time. <b>Other-directed</b> subjects did have an increase in anxiety scores, but it was not significant at the. 05 level of confidence.

40|$|Reflecting on an {{important}} personal {{value in a}} self-affirmation activity {{has been shown to}} improve psychological functioning in a broad range of studies, but the underlying mechanisms for these self-affirmation effects are unknown. Here we provide an initial test of a novel self-compassion account of self-affirmation in two experimental studies. Study 1 shows that an experimental manipulation of self-affirmation (3 -min of writing about {{an important}} personal value vs. writing about an unimportant value) increases feelings of self-compassion, and these feelings in turn mobilize more pro-social behaviors to a laboratory shelf-collapse incident. Study 2 tests and extends these effects by evaluating whether self-affirmation increases feelings of compassion toward the self (consistent with the self-compassion account) or increases feelings of compassion toward others (an alternative <b>other-directed</b> compassion account), using a validated storytelling behavioral task. Consistent with a self-compassion account, Study 2 demonstrates the predicted self-affirmation by video condition interaction, indicating that self-affirmation participants had greater feelings of self-compassion in response to watching their own storytelling performance (self-compassion) compared to watching a peer 2 ̆ 7 s storytelling performance (<b>other-directed</b> compassion). Further, pre-existing levels of trait self-compassion moderated this effect, such that self-affirmation increased self-compassionate responses the most in participants low in trait self-compassion.

In the present study, we investigated whether those types of coping styles are predicted by: infants’ physiological responses; maternal representations of their infant’s temperament; maternal interactive behaviour in free play; and infant birth and medical status. The sample consisted of 46, healthy, prematurely born infants and their mothers. At one month, infant heart rate was collected in basal. At three months old (corrected age), infant heart-rate was registered during FFSF episodes. Mothers described their infants’ temperament using a validated Portuguese temperament scale, at infants three months of corrected age. As well, maternal interactive behaviour was evaluated during a free play situation using CARE-Index. Our findings indicate that positive coping behaviours were correlated with gestational birth weight, heart rate (HR), gestational age, and maternal sensitivity in free play. Gestational age and maternal sensitivity predicted Positive Other-Direct Coping behaviours. Moreover, Positive Other-Direct coping was negatively correlated with HR during Still-Face Episode. Self-directed behaviours were correlated with HR during Still-Face Episode and Recover Episode and with maternal controlling/intrusive behaviour. However, only maternal behaviour predicted Self-direct coping. Early social responses seem {{to be affected by}} infants’ birth status and by maternal interactive behaviour.

40|$|The current {{research}} was conducted to determine the accuracy of four models of gender differences in achievement orientation, {{and the extent to}} which the models are redundant. Bakan 2 ̆ 7 s (1966) model suggests that men strive for mastery and self-enhancement (agentic orientation), whereas women are interested in social goals (communal orientation). Stein and Bailey 2 ̆ 7 s (1973) model portrays women 2 ̆ 7 s achievement strivings as directed at the attainment of excellence in social-affiliative activities (social focus), whereas men strive for mastery of objective tasks (task focus). Kipnis 2 ̆ 7 (1974) model suggests that women feel successful to the extent that personal goals have been met (inner-directed), and that men evaluate their performance in relation to that of their peers (<b>other-directed).</b> Veroff 2 ̆ 7 s (1977) model predicts that women focus on how something was accomplished (process emphasis), whereas men are primarily interested in what was done (impact emphasis). Self-reports of success and failure experiences of female and male undergraduates were examined by trained raters. Scores derived from the content analyses revealed that males 2 ̆ 7 experiences showed greater impact orientation and less inner-direction than did those of females. No gender differences were found for agentic, communal, task, social, process, or <b>other-directed</b> foci in achievement. Thus, Kipnis 2 ̆ 7 and Veroff 2 ̆ 7 s models seem more accurate than Bakan 2 ̆ 7 s and Stein and Bailey 2 ̆ 7 s in predicting gender differences in achievement. Factor analyses revealed overlap among the eight dimensions based on the four models, since only two important achievement focus dimensions were found. Task and agentic vs. social and communal foci provided a domain dimension. A performance evaluation dimension was determined by impact and <b>other-directed</b> vs. inner-directed and process foci. Further analyses involved measures of subject 2 ̆ 7 s masculinity-feminity (Personal Attributes Questionnaire; Spence et al., 1974), achievement motivation (Work and Family Orientation Questionnaire; Helmreich 2 ̆ 6 Spence, 1978), and causal attributions. The results of this research indicate: (1) sex-role stereotypes are intimately related to the domains of important achievement activities; however, men and women do not differ in the kinds of activities (domains) that they report as successes or failures, and (2) women and men differ in how they define success and failure, but these performance evaluation styles are not related to sex-role stereotypes...|$|E
