5|$|The roots are, generally, an {{underground}} {{part of the}} tree, but some tree species have evolved roots that are aerial. The common purposes for aerial roots may be of two kinds, {{to contribute to the}} mechanical stability of the tree, and to obtain oxygen from air. An instance of mechanical stability enhancement is the red mangrove that develops prop roots that loop out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> and branches and descend vertically into the mud. A similar structure is developed by the Indian banyan. Many large trees have buttress roots which flare out from the lower part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk.</b> These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide stability, reducing sway in high winds. They are particularly prevalent in tropical rainforests where the soil is poor and the roots are close to the surface.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} health problem is {{spinal muscular atrophy}} (SMA), another genetically inherited disease which causes {{the loss of the}} spinal-cord neurons which activate the skeletal muscles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> and limbs. Symptoms are normally seen within 3–4 months of age and result in muscle atrophy, muscle weakness, and a shortened life span. A test is offered to detect the genes responsible for SMA.|$|E

5|$|The {{main purpose}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> {{is to raise}} the leaves above the ground, {{enabling}} the tree to reach the light and survive: the tree can overtop other plants and shade them out. It also performs the task of transporting water and nutrients from the roots to the aerial parts of the tree and to distribute the food produced by the leaves to all other parts including the roots.|$|E

5|$|Large parties trimmed the cut stems, {{and left}} them to dry for days or weeks. As well as stems, the rhizomes—extensions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> {{below the surface of}} the ground shaped like {{enormous}} carrots—were also dug up to be cooked. In the early 1840s, Edward Shortland said Māori preferred rhizomes from trees growing in deep rich soil. They dug them in spring or early summer just before the flowering of the plant, when they were at their sweetest. November was the favourite month for preparing kāuru in the South Island.|$|E

5|$|The African {{elephant}} has two finger-like extensions {{at the tip}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> {{that allow}} it to grasp and bring food to its mouth. The Asian elephant has only one, and relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into its mouth. Asian elephants have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex tasks. Losing the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant's survival, although in rare cases, individuals have survived with shortened ones. One elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs, raising {{on its hind legs}} and taking in grass with its lips. Floppy trunk syndrome is a condition of trunk paralysis in African bush elephants caused by the degradation of the peripheral nerves and muscles beginning at the tip.|$|E
5|$|The {{back was}} also reconstructed {{in a more}} or less {{horizontal}} orientation by Borsuk-Białynicka, which was followed by most subsequent depictions. In a 2007 study, Daniela Schwarz and colleagues suggested that the back dipped towards the rear. According to these researchers, the shoulder blade would have been inclined at a horizontal angle of 55–65°, much steeper than previously thought, resulting in an elevated shoulder region. With the vertebral column <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> and neck held in a relatively straight line, this would result in an elevated position of the head.|$|E
5|$|The system's {{predecessors}} {{date back}} to the opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trunk</b> Line in 1854. By 1902, all the routes used by the present commuter rail had been taken into service. Electrification started in 1922, and Class 62 EMUs were introduced in 1931, followed by Class 65 units in 1936 and Class 67 in 1953. Electrification was completed in 1963. In 1980, the Drammen Line was connected {{to the rest of the}} system and all trains started operating to the new OsloS. The high-speed Gardermoen Line opened in 1998. In 2013, new Stadler FLIRT units were taken into traffic, and the Asker Line was completed just before. By 2018, the Follo Line is scheduled to open.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of {{angiosperms}} and gymnosperms, the outermost layer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> is the bark and is mostly composed of dead cells. It provides a thick, waterproof covering to the living inner tissue. It protects the trunk against the elements, disease, animal attack and fire. It is perforated by {{a large number of}} fine breathing pores called lenticels, through which oxygen diffuses. Bark is continually replaced by a living layer of cells called the cork cambium. The London plane (Platanus × acerifolia) periodically sheds its bark in large flakes. Similarly, the bark of the silver birch (Betula pendula) peels off in strips. As the tree's girth expands, newer layers of bark are larger in circumference, and the older layers develop fissures in many species. In some trees such as the pine (Pinus species) the bark exudes sticky resin which deters attackers whereas in rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) it is a milky latex that oozes out. The quinine bark tree (Cinchona officinalis) contains bitter substances to make the bark unpalatable. Large tree-like plants with lignified trunks in the Pteridophyta, Arecales, Cycadophyta and Poales such as the tree ferns, palms, cycads and bamboos have no true bark, but they do have an outer protective covering of some form.|$|E
5|$|Spinal polio, {{the most}} common form of paralytic poliomyelitis, results from viral {{invasion}} of the motor neurons of the anterior horn cells, or the ventral (front) grey matter section in the spinal column, which are responsible for movement of the muscles, including those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk,</b> limbs, and the intercostal muscles. Virus invasion causes inflammation of the nerve cells, leading to damage or destruction of motor neuron ganglia. When spinal neurons die, Wallerian degeneration takes place, leading to weakness of those muscles formerly innervated by the now-dead neurons. With the destruction of nerve cells, the muscles no longer receive signals from the brain or spinal cord; without nerve stimulation, the muscles atrophy, becoming weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and finally completely paralyzed. Maximum paralysis progresses rapidly (two to four days), and usually involves fever and muscle pain. Deep tendon reflexes are also affected, and are typically absent or diminished; sensation (the ability to feel) in the paralyzed limbs, however, is not affected.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} fish {{is divided}} into a head, trunk and tail, {{although}} the divisions between the three are not always externally visible. The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish, is either made of cartilage, in cartilaginous fish, or bone in bony fish. The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine {{and there are no}} limbs or limb girdles. The main external features of the fish, the fins, are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays, which {{with the exception of the}} caudal fins, have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk.</b> The heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the gills and on round the body in a single circulatory loop. The eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision. There is an inner ear but no external or middle ear. Low frequency vibrations are detected by the lateral line system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish, and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure.|$|E

5|$|The {{newly created}} xylem is the sapwood. It is {{composed}} of water-conducting cells and associated cells which are often living, and is usually pale in colour. It transports water and minerals from the roots to the upper parts of the tree. The oldest, inner part of the sapwood is progressively converted into heartwood as new sapwood is formed at the cambium. The conductive cells of the heartwood are blocked in some species, and the surrounding cells are more often dead. Heartwood is usually darker in colour than the sapwood. It is the dense central core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> giving it rigidity. Three quarters of the dry mass of the xylem is cellulose, a polysaccharide, {{and most of the}} remainder is lignin, a complex polymer. A transverse section through a tree trunk or a horizontal core will show concentric circles or lighter or darker wood - tree rings. These rings are the annual growth rings There may also be rays running at right angles to growth rings. These are vascular rays which are thin sheets of living tissue permeating the wood. Many older trees may become hollow but may still stand upright for many years.|$|E
25|$|A shari is {{deadwood}} on {{the main}} trunk of the bonsai. A small shari usually runs vertically {{on or near the}} front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> - shari have little aesthetic value at the rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk,</b> where they are rarely viewed and are obscured by branch growth. The shallow wound exposes a non-living portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk,</b> which will be surrounded by living bark. The natural causes of shari include a falling branch that has ripped bark from the trunk below it, lightning damage, or trunk damage from another external source. Shari may occur naturally on a bonsai, or may be created by carving the bark.|$|E

The pelvic girdle is composed of the appendicular hip bones (ilium, ischium, and pubis) oriented in a ring, and connects the pelvic region of the spine to the lower limbs. The pelvic spine consists of the sacrum and coccyx.|$|E
40|$|From a seven {{year old}} {{population}} of acacia mangium, discs {{were taken from}} <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> 126 trees in order to study the species’ basic density.   The basic average density (DBM) found was between 0. 524 + 0. 076 g/cm 3.   The axial variation for the basic density (Db), explained according to a quadratic model (R 2 = 0. 83), revealed a reduction tendency of up to half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk’s</b> height, increasing from this point {{up to the top}} without reaching the Db’s value for the base.   The linear model was what best explained the relation between the DBM and the Db, obtained at various positions along <b>the</b> <b>trunk.</b>   In fact, this relation  was even more accentuated (R 2 = 0. 81) at 25 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk’s</b> height.   Thus, in <b>the</b> determining <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species’ DBM through destructive methods, samples taken at 25 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk’s</b> height can be used.   Nevertheless, for non-destructive samples, <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> 25 %, may be too much, and so, withdrawing a sample, using an Pressler’s cork bore, for example, may not be feasible.   In this case, withdrawing from the DAP is suggested because the relation at this height is also high (0. 78). </p...|$|R
