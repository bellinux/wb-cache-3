5|$|On December 20, 2009, {{during a}} {{counseling}} session with two colleagues to discuss her poor time-keeping, Manning {{was told she}} would lose her one day off a week for persistent lateness. She responded by overturning a table, damaging a computer that was sitting on it. A sergeant moved Manning away from the weapons rack, and other soldiers pinned her arms behind her back and dragged {{her out of the}} room. Several witnesses to the incident believed her access to sensitive material <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> withdrawn at that point. The following month, January 2010, she began posting on Facebook that she felt hopeless and alone.|$|E
5|$|During {{his search}} for backers, Borchgrevink met Sir George Newnes, a leading British {{magazine}} publisher and cinema pioneer whose portfolio included the Westminster Gazette, Tit-Bits, Country Life and the Strand Magazine. It was not unusual for publishers to support exploration—Newnes's great rival Alfred Harmsworth (later Lord Northcliffe) had recently financed Frederick Jackson's expedition to Franz Josef Land, and had pledged financial backing to the National Antarctic Expedition. Newnes was sufficiently impressed by Borchgrevink to offer the full costs of his proposed expedition—around £40,000, (at least £3million in 2008 values). This generosity infuriated Sir Clements Markham and the geographical establishment, who saw Borchgrevink as a penniless Norwegian nobody who had secured British money which they believed <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> theirs. Markham maintained an attitude of hostility and contempt towards Borchgrevink, and chastised Mill for attending the launch of his expedition.|$|E
5|$|Several issues marked Johnston's senatorial career. He {{was caught}} in the middle during the debate over the Arlington Memorial. The initial {{proposal}} to relocate the dead was distasteful to Johnston, yet the ensuing debate caused him to want to defend the memory of Robert E. Lee; the need to stay quiet {{for the sake of the}} Democratic Party, however, proved decisive. Johnston was an outspoken opponent of the Texas-Pacific Bill, a sectional struggle for control of railroads in the South, which figured in the Compromise of 1877. He was also an outspoken Funder during Virginia's heated debate as to how much of its pre-War debt the state <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> obliged to pay back. The controversy culminated in the formation of the Readjuster Party and the appointment of William Mahone as its leader; this marked the end of Johnston's career in the Senate.|$|E

5|$|Once leave is granted, an {{applicant}} {{moves on to}} the second stage and applies for a prerogative order by filing in the High Court a document called a summons within the legal proceedings already started earlier. This must be done between eight and 14 days after leave {{to do so is}} granted by the Court; beyond that, the leave lapses. The applicant must serve the ex parte originating summons, the statement, the supporting affidavit, the order granting leave, and the summons by which the prerogative order is actually applied for, on all persons directly affected. Where the application relates to court proceedings and is intended to compel the court or a court official to do an act relating to the proceedings, or to quash the proceedings or any order made in them, the documents must be served on the registrar of the court and the other parties to the proceedings. The documents must also be served on the judge if his or her conduct is being objected to. If the Court is of opinion that any person who <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> served with the documents has not been served, the Court may adjourn the hearing on such terms as it may direct in order that the documents may be served on that person.|$|E
25|$|Some sources also {{indicate}} that bayonet charges already {{were known to be}} hopeless, and that Beck ought to have known this. The regulations had a procedure for bayonet charges, and this makes the criticism by Beck unreasonable. At the same time it can contribute to explain the outcome - {{to the extent that it}} is correct that bayonet charges already <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> disused.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Hill Hassall long {{corresponded with}} Ralfs, who {{suggested}} that they should render each other assistance in their inquiries. But when Hassall's British Freshwater Algæ, including Descriptions of the Desmideæ and Diatomaceæ, which, in Ralfs's opinion, <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> published jointly, appeared in 1845, no mention was made of Ralfs. The , by Andrew Pritchard, was enlarged and revised by Ralfs and other botanists. His contribution on the diatomaceæ was condensed by Pritchard (pp.756–940).|$|E

The {{question of whether the}} world and the flesh are inherently bad and what the individual's proper relationship <b>to</b> them <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>has</b> long <b>been</b> debated in many philosophical and spiritual traditions; see Manichaeism and Gnosticism.|$|R
25|$|In {{spite of}} these documents, there are no written {{accounts}} of the Guadalupe vision by Catholic clergymen of the 16th century, as there <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> if the event had the importance it is claimed to have had. In particular, the canonical account of the vision features archbishop Juan de Zumárraga as {{a major player in}} the story, but, although Zumárraga was a prolific writer, there is nothing in his extant writings that can confirm the story.|$|E
25|$|There {{were many}} herds and flocks. The flocks were {{committed}} to a shepherd, who gave receipt for them and took them out to pasture. The Code fixed his wage. He was responsible for all care, must restore ox for ox, sheep for sheep and must breed them satisfactorily. Any dishonest use of the flock had to be repaid tenfold, but loss due to disease or wild beasts fell upon the owner. The shepherd made good all loss due to his own neglect. If he let the flock feed on a field of crops, he had to pay damages fourfold; if he turned them into standing crops when they <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> folded, he paid twelvefold.|$|E
25|$|Leicestershire Foxes {{took the}} win at Trent Bridge in a low-scoring match. Nottinghamshire Outlaws {{had won the}} toss and bowled first, and <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> pretty pleased with restricting the Foxes to 150 for 4, even though they conceded 15 extras. The opening {{partnership}} of HD Ackerman and Darren Maddy for 67 runs had promised more for Leicestershire. However, West Indian Ottis Gibson dug out two early wickets in Graeme Swann and Stephen Fleming - Darren Maddy and David Masters then took wickets at leisure, and Nottinghamshire were 96 for 7. Despite a rescue mission from Gareth Clough who hit 30 off 16 balls, there was no hitting power from the other players, and Nottinghamshire finished on 129 for 8.|$|E

25|$|Liverpool had {{elections}} {{three years}} out of four, with one third of councillors elected in each election. The Liverpool councillors did appeal – bringing in {{the argument that the}} extraordinary audit had not notified the councillors of their right for an oral hearing to put their case before making a finding of wilful misconduct. The Court of Appeal agreed that an oral hearing <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> allowed, but that the subsequent High Court hearing had cured that deficiency. The councillors then appealed to the House of Lords which unanimously rejected the appeal on 12 March 1987, ruling that the auditor's procedure was fair and not prejudiced against the council. The total surcharge to be paid by 47 current and former councillors (two had died in the meantime) amounted to £333,000.|$|E
25|$|At this point, the Union {{soldiers}} {{continued the}} {{attack against the}} remaining lines, seeking refuge near {{the crest of the}} ridge (the top line of rifle pits were sited on the actual crest rather than the military crest of the ridge, leaving blind spots). This second advance was taken up by the commanders on the spot, but also by some of the soldiers who, on their own, sought shelter from the fire further up the slope. The Union advance was disorganized but effective; finally overwhelming and scattering what <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been,</b> as General Grant himself believed, an impregnable Confederate line. In combination with an advance from {{the southern end of the}} ridge by divisions under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, the Union Army routed Bragg's army, which retreated to Dalton, Georgia, ending the siege of Union forces in Chattanooga, Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|The three {{deaths were}} the only Americans killed {{as a result of}} attacks on American ships by German {{submarine}} until 16 March 1917, when diplomatic relations had irreparably broken down just before the declaration of war. American official reaction to the incident was determined by President Woodrow Wilson under the advice of United States Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan and Counselor to the State Department Robert Lansing. Bryan favoured reconciliation with Germany and avoidance of war, but this policy was becoming increasingly unpopular and was opposed by his subordinate Lansing. Lansing submitted a memorandum proposing immediate and vigorous protest and coupled with the Cushing incident and the sinking of RMS Lusitania on 7 May, a British ship but carrying American passengers who drowned, president Wilson made a forceful response to Germany. In June Bryan resigned and was replaced by Lansing. Despite his belligerent formal advice, Lansing's private papers suggest that he considered the rights and wrongs of the situation much more finely balanced and the logical outcome <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> impartial military trade sanctions against both belligerents. However, the US economy was already heavily committed to producing military supplies for the British, while American support for {{one side or the other}} was likely to prove decisive in choosing the eventual victor.|$|E

25|$|The closing {{feast of}} Sukkot (i.e., Shemini Atzeret) <b>ought</b> rightly <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been,</b> {{like that of}} Passover (i.e., Shavuot) on the fiftieth day; but, {{in order not to}} force the people to make another journey to Jerusalem in the rainy season, God fixed it as early as the eighth day.|$|R
50|$|Constanza appealed {{against his}} {{conviction}} {{on the grounds}} that the case <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> left <b>to</b> the jury as the violence that the victim feared <b>had</b> not <b>been</b> sufficiently immediate because the victim could not see the potential perpetrator. Constanza also argued that an assault could not be committed solely by words, but physical action was necessary.|$|R
500|$|Various British {{newspapers}} also cried foul. The Evening Standard {{believed that}} as [...] "Argentina's greatest creditor and greatest client", Britain <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> awarded the two ships.

500|$|Elisabeth Mahoney in The Guardian was {{critical}} of the second series. While praising the discussion between the guests as, [...] "funny and flowing, and quite endearingly quirky", she found that the programme [...] "fizzled away when it reached what <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> its crux: the donation of kooky items to the imaginary museum.

There was a presumption of constitutionality for the orders, and the burden was on the appellants to prove that they were unconstitutional or ultra vires.|$|E

40|$|Research {{evidence}} {{has suggested that}} the environmental reports produced by listed South African companies, like in other countries are perceived to be deficient in decision-usefulness, thus not of a standard that can satisfy the decision-making needs of users of these reports. This article explores whether the perceived deficiency in the decision-usefulness of the reports is due to differing perceptions between users and preparers of the reports with regard to what decision-useful reports <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be. The article thus explores whether an environmental reporting expectation gap exists within South Africa with regard to what attributes the reports <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> decision-useful. Using a questionnaire survey, this study elicited the perceptions of 54 individuals from three user groups, namely, ethical investors, environmental groups and accounting academics, {{as well as those of}} 42 preparers from the Top 100 South African companies listed on the Johannesburg Securities Exchange (JSE). Up on comparing the responses, significant differences were found between the views of users and preparers in relation to the attributes that decision-useful environmental reports <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have.</b> The differences <b>are</b> consistent with the existence of an expectation gap in South Africa with regard to the decision-usefulness of the environmental reports.

2500|$|Whether Callas's vocal decline {{was due to}} ill health, early menopause, over-use {{and abuse}} of her voice, loss of breath-support, loss of confidence, or weight loss will {{continue}} to be debated.

500|$|In 2011, Walsh {{threatened}} to move Diageo's headquarters {{away from the}} United Kingdom, following {{the introduction of a}} 50 per cent income tax rate for high earners. He said: [...] "I believe the 50 per cent tax rate will lead to the long-term damage of this nation’s competitive edge." [...] In April 2012, the Daily Mail accused him of personal income tax avoidance.

500|$|The {{brilliant}} palette <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{expected by}} the restorers {{as the same}} range of colours appears {{in the works of}} Giotto, Masaccio and Masolino, Fra Angelico and Piero della Francesca, as well as Ghirlandaio himself and later fresco painters such as Annibale Carracci and Tiepolo. The reason for employing this range of colours is that many other pigments are not usable in fresco as they have chemical properties that react badly in interaction with wet plaster. [...] The colour that is noticeably missing from Michelangelo's ceiling, but not The Last Judgment, is the intense blue of lapis lazuli. This colour, achieved by grinding semi-precious stone, was always applied as a secondary, a secco stage, along with the gold leaf applied as haloes and decoration to robes.|$|E
500|$|For the 1997 American {{television}} showing, {{the film}} was broadcast virtually unedited. The telecast {{was the first to}} receive a TV-M (now TV-MA) rating under the TV Parental Guidelines that had been established earlier that year. Tom Coburn, then an Oklahoma congressman, said that in airing the film, NBC had brought television [...] "to an all-time low, with full-frontal nudity, violence and profanity", adding that it was an insult to [...] "decent-minded individuals everywhere". Under fire from both Republicans and Democrats, Coburn apologized, saying, [...] "My intentions were good, but I've obviously made an error in judgment in how I've gone about saying what I wanted to say." [...] He clarified his opinion, stating that the film <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> aired later at night when there would not be [...] "large numbers of children watching without parental supervision".|$|E

40|$|What are the {{benefits}} and significance of developing a scientifically useful measure of the human sense of presence in an environment? Such a scale could be conceived to measure {{the extent to which}} users of telerobotics interfaces feel or behave as if they were present at the site of a remotely controlled robot. The essay examines some issues raised in order to identify characteristics, a scale of 'presence' <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> useful as an explanatory scientific concept. It also addresses the utility of worrying about developing such a scale at all. To be useful {{in the same manner as}} a traditional scientific concept such as mass, for example, it is argued that such scales not only need to be precisely defined and co-vary with determinative factors but also need to establish equivalence classes of its independent constituents. This simplifying property is important for either subjective or objective scales of presence and arises if the constituents of presence are truly independent...|$|R
