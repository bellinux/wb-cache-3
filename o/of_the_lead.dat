5|$|Vanadinite is a lead {{chlorovanadate}} {{with the}} chemical formula Pb5(VO4)3Cl. It is composed (by weight) of 73.15% lead, 10.79% vanadium, 13.56% oxygen, and 2.50% chlorine. Each structural unit of vanadinite contains a chlorine ion surrounded by six divalent lead ions {{at the corners}} of a regular octahedron, with one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> ions provided by an adjoining vanadinite molecule. The distance between each lead and chlorine ion is 317picometres. The shortest distance between each lead ion is 4.48Å. The octahedron shares two of its opposite faces with that of neighbouring vanadinite units, forming a continuous chain of octahedrons. Each vanadium atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms {{at the corners of}} an irregular tetrahedron. The distance between each oxygen and vanadium atom is either 1.72 or 1.76Å. Three oxygen tetrahedrons adjoin each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> octahedrons along the chain.|$|E
5|$|After {{negotiations}} with Mančevski fell through, Mark Rydell was contracted {{to direct the}} biopic in February 1996. Rydell was also close friends with Dean; the two studied together at Actors Studio in Manhattan, New York during the early 1950s. DiCaprio dropped out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> role entirely when his asking price {{was determined to be}} too high after the actor's success with Romeo + Juliet (1996) and Titanic (1997). Meanwhile, Rydell worked with Horovitz on another rewrite, and Warner Bros. planned to fast track production. Don Was was hired to write and compose the film score, but he was later replaced by John Frizzell. Shortly after Rydell's hiring, Stephen Dorff entered discussions to portray James Dean. Ethan Hawke would later turn down the role.|$|E
5|$|All {{the three}} ships {{of the class}} were {{constructed}} at the Mazagon Dock Limited. The construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> ship, Shivalik, commenced in December 2000.

The second ship, Satpura, was laid in October 2002. It was launched in June 2004 and commissioned in August 2011. The third and final ship, Sahyadri, was laid in September 2003, launched in May 2005 and commissioned in July 2012. All the three ships are named after hill-ranges in India: Shivalik after the Sivalik Hills, Satpura after the Satpura range and Sahyadri after the Sahyadri range commonly called Western Ghats.|$|E

40|$|We {{follow the}} nonequilibrium Green's {{function}} formalism to study time-dependent thermal transport in a linear chain system {{consisting of two}} semi-infinite leads connected together by a coupling that is harmonically modulated in time. The modulation is driven by an external agent that can absorb and emit energy. We determine the energy current flowing out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> exactly by solving numerically the Dyson equation for the contour-ordered Green's function. <b>The</b> amplitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modulated coupling is <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same order as the interparticle coupling within each <b>lead.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> have <b>the</b> same temperature, our numerical results show that modulating the coupling between <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> may direct energy to either flow into <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> simultaneously or flow out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> simultaneously, depending on <b>the</b> values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driving frequency and temperature. A special combination <b>of</b> values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driving frequency and temperature exists wherein no net energy flows into or out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leads,</b> even for long times. When one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> is warmer than the other, net energy flows out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> warmer <b>lead.</b> For <b>the</b> cooler <b>lead,</b> however, <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> energy current flow depends on <b>the</b> values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driving frequency and temperature. In addition, we find transient effects to become more pronounced for higher values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driving frequency. Comment: 10 pages; version 2 accepted for publication in PR...|$|R

5|$|Although initial {{box office}} {{reception}} was positive {{both in the}} United Kingdom and overseas, Inseminoid has since failed to impress a majority of critics, who have faulted Warren's film for perceived poor acting, special effects and set design. Despite praise for actress Judy Geeson's depiction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> character, Sandy, approval of the film in general has been tarnished due to its concept of an extraterrestrial insemination, which has been viewed negatively {{in comparison to the}} premise of Alien (1979).

The film was dubbed into Telugu as Sathyame Sivam and released on 28 February 2003. It was dubbed into Hindi as Shivam two years later in 2005.
