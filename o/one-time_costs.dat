The first purchase includes a <b>one-time</b> <b>cost</b> of 50 rubles, and its active lifetime is projected as 3½ years; defective cards are exchanged at no cost. Unlimited cards are also available for students at reduced price (as of 2017, 365 rubles—or about $US6—for a calendar month of unlimited usage) for a <b>one-time</b> <b>cost</b> of 70 rubles.

Thus, if this <b>one-time</b> additional <b>cost</b> can be tolerated, as one would expect in a typical use case, the use of a RELOAD overlay is no more expensive than the use of a central server when it comes to CoAP delays.|$|R
5000|$|Debt {{restructuring}}: The bill authorizes {{the restructuring}} of principal payments in fiscal year 2010-11 on the state's general obligation bonds. These principal repayments will be paid in future years. Since the state is required to make debt service payments by March 15, the bill must be enacted by February 25 to allow time to sell the refinancing bonds. This provision will reduce debt service costs by $165 million in fiscal year 2010-11.

5000|$|Care Everywhere is Epic's health {{information}} exchange software, which comes with its EHR system. A 2014 New York Times article interviews two doctors {{who say that}} their Epic systems won't allow them to share data with users of competitors' software {{in a way that}} will satisfy Meaningful Use requirements in a 2009 law. At first, Epic charged a fee to send data to some non-Epic systems. Epic says the yearly cost for an average-sized hospital is around $5,000 a year. However, after Congressional hearings, Epic and other major software vendors announced that they would suspend per-transaction sharing fees. Epic customers must still pay for <b>one-time</b> <b>costs</b> of linking Epic systems to each individual non-Epic system with which they wish to exchange data; in contrast, Epic's competitors have formed the CommonWell Health Alliance which set a common interoperability standard for electronic health records. A 2014 report by the RAND Corporation described Epic as a [...] "closed" [...] platform that made it [...] "challenging and costly for hospitals" [...] to interconnect with the clinical or billing software of other companies. The report also cited other research showing that Epic's implementation in the Kaiser Permanente system led to efficiency losses. Implementation in the Hennepin Health system did not change outcomes for critically ill patients, however, physicians complained of workflow interruptions and slower processes of care.|$|E

Requires Secretary of State to test and certify voting systems, to accredit means of identifying and authenticating voters, to protect voter confidentiality, and to adopt rules and regulations governing Internet voting procedures.
