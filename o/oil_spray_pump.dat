40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The {{influence}} of <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> {{on the field}} spread of the aphid-borne bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) in bean was studied in 1972 and 1973. <b>Oil</b> <b>sprays</b> failed to significantly reduce virus spread in the 1972 BYMV experiment. However, the data did suggest that {{the efficiency of the}} <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> could be greatly improved by timing the applications to periods of peak aphid activity. Several factors were identified which could have contributed to the failure of <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> to reduce the incidence of BYMV in 1972. An excessive time lag between bean emergence and the first oil application resulted in a considerable amount of virus spread within all of the plots before any <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> were applied. In addition, some of the treatments were subject to a disproportionate number of the dispersing aphid population which resulted in non-uniform virus spread throughout the study area. And all treatments were exposed for an excessive length of time to the gladioli or primary virus reservoir. As a result, the <b>oil</b> <b>sprayed</b> areas were subject to extreme pressure from the secondary and primary virus reservoirs. Results of the 1973 BYMV field experiment clearly indicate that <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> can protect bean plants against spread of BYMV under field conditions. A number of changes in the experimental design were responsible for the overall success of the 1973 experiment. The time lag between bean emergence and the first oil application was eliminated. This change prevented an excessive amount of virus spread early in the season, thus eliminating the high, non-differential virus spread that results when {{there is a lack of}} virus protection early in the season. And the exposure period of beans to the gladioli, primary virus source, was substantially reduced so that <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> were directed against the secondary virus source and not both primary and secondary virus sources. Harvest data collected during 1973 indicated that an increase in plant weight may not occur as a result of virus reduction by <b>oil</b> <b>sprays.</b> The data suggest that repeated applications of oil may bring about a physiological response resulting in an increase in plant weight unrelated to virus reduction...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Best {{practice}} guidelines {{have been}} developed in recent years for application of low volume, concentrated pesticide sprays to avocado orchards. <b>Oil</b> <b>sprays,</b> {{an important component of}} spray programmes on avocado orchards, have been excluded from the concentrate programme because of the risk of damage to the crop. Two unreplicated trials were undertaken on commercial orchards, one each in Northland and Bay of Plenty, from December 2012 -December 2013. Each plot consisted of a single orchard block (ca 1 ha) per treatment. Dilute (0. 5 % <b>oil)</b> high volume <b>sprays</b> (up to 3000 litres/ha) were compared with concentrated (1. 5 % <b>oil)</b> low-volume <b>sprays</b> (up to 1000 litres/ha) containing a horticultural superspreader adjuvant.

This study was aimed at determining the effect of seed treatment with metalaxyl either alone or in combination with neem seed <b>oil</b> foliar <b>sprays</b> on the incidence of pearl millet downy mildew. Field trials were carried out in 2006 and 2007 growing seasons. Split - plot design was employed with four categories of chemical treatments and three varieties of pearl millet (SOSAT-C 88, EX-Borno and GB 8735). The treatments were in triplicates. The results of the study showed that incidence of downy mildew on vegetative shoots of pearl millet differed significantly (p< 0. 05) among the varieties studied. Generally, SOSAT-C 88 showed significant resistance to downy mildew than the other varieties. As anticipated, the combination of metalaxyl and neem <b>oil</b> <b>spray</b> significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced the incidence of downy mildew on pearl millet and improved yield compared to the neem <b>oil</b> <b>spray</b> alone and the control during the 2006 season.

40|$|Purpose: In this study, a {{numerical}} simulation {{model of the}} <b>oil</b> <b>spraying</b> system is established. Design/methodology/approach: Spraying lubrication is a common form of the rolling bearing lubrication. Butwith the increase of the bearing speed, the roller cage is frequently shattered, which may lead to failure of thebearing. The shatter of roller cage {{may be related to}} the <b>spraying</b> mode of <b>oil.</b> For high-speed rolling bearing,the roller cage shatter can be cracked due to the shortage of oil, caused by lubricating <b>oil</b> not <b>sprayed</b> into theroller cage shatter. This condition can be ameliorated by changing the <b>spraying</b> mode of <b>oil</b> supply system. Themodel considered the spraying speed, <b>spraying</b> angle, <b>oil</b> pressure, oil viscosity, structure of roller cage shatter,rotating speed as the main parameters. By optimization, the best way of <b>oil</b> <b>spraying</b> was obtained which canmeet lubrication requirement of high-speed rolling bearing. At the same time, the numerical simulation resultsalso revealed that the optimal spraying mode is different for different rolling bearings. Findings: The simulating results indicate that due to the effect of the air pressure and airflow thickness, theoptimal spraying position is at a region closer to the inner ring of the bearings. Practical implications: This paper will provide useful information to applying numerical simulation of the oilspraying system. Originality/value: The computer simulation allows to better understand the interdependence betweenparameters of process and choosing optimal solution...|$|R
