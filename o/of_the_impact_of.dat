Recently a framework known as the “Triple Bottom Line” (TBL) covering economic, socio-cultural and environmental dimensions has been incorporated into <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> mega-sporting events’ <b>impacts</b> studies. This thesis aims to contribute to <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TBL framework for evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> mega-sporting events.

5|$|A single soldier {{arriving}} in Mexico in 1520 was carrying smallpox and initiated the devastating plagues that {{swept through the}} native populations of the Americas. Modern estimates of native population decline vary from 75% to 90% mortality.

Among the most deadly diseases were the aforementioned smallpox, influenza, measles and a number of pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis.

This was followed in early 1961 by an Alaska Sportsmen's Council resolution that criticized the Corps of Engineers for reducing its funding for studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> the project on fish and game stocks.

5|$|Regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> the {{propaganda}} campaigns, the Catholic immigrants helped to strengthen Diem's support base. Before the partition, most of Vietnam's Catholic population {{lived in the}} north. After the borders were sealed, the majority were now under Diem's rule. The Catholics implicitly trusted Diem due to their common faith and were a source of loyal political support. One of Diem's main objections to the Geneva Accords—which the State of Vietnam refused to sign—was that it deprived him of the Catholic regions of North Vietnam, and he had unsuccessfully called for Bui Chu and Phat Diem to be omitted from the communist zone. With entire Catholic provinces moving south en masse, in 1956 the Diocese of Saigon had more Catholics than Paris and Rome. Of Vietnam's 1.45million Catholics, over a million lived in the south, 55% of whom were northern refugees. Prior to this, only 520,000 Catholics lived in the Dioceses of Saigon and Huế combined.|$|E
